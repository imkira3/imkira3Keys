00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,883
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

3
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:52,887
<i>Focus. Speed. I am speed.</i>

4
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:59,894
<i>One winner, 42 losers.
I eat losers for breakfast.</i>

5
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,648
<i>Did I used to say that?</i>

6
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,650
Yes, sir, you did.

7
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,529
- You used to say that all the time.
- Mater, what are you doing in here?

8
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:11,698
Well, I didn't want you to be lonely.

9
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,119
Thank you.
But I'm kind of preparing for a race.

10
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:17,203
I need a little quiet.

11
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:19,247
Oh, right. You got it, buddy.

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,709
Hey, everybody, listen up.

13
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:27,338
My best friend, Lightning McQueen,
needs quiet. Perfect quiet!

14
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:30,800
Okay. Where was I?

15
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,305
Racing. Real racing.

16
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:40,184
That ain't racing.
That wasn't even a Sunday drive.

17
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,477
That was one lap.

18
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,814
Racing is 500 of those.
Everybody fighting to move up.

19
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:48,943
Lap after lap. Inside, outside,
inches apart. Never touching.

20
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,528
Now that's racing.

21
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:54,699
Well, I can't argue with The Doc Hudson.

22
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,201
How true, how true.

23
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:01,205
Hey, Lightning, you ready?

24
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:03,708
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready.

25
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:08,671
This one's for you, Doc.

26
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:29,140
Whoo-hoo! Come on, Stickers.

27
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:31,351
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Best friend coming through.

28
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:33,436
Go, McQueen! Whoo-hoo!

29
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:37,107
- Pass him now, 24!
- Lightning McQueen!

30
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:41,695
Go, 95!

31
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:42,988
Whoo-hoo!

32
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:45,820
Hey, Cal, your blinker's on.

33
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:49,782
What? No, it's not. Hey! Your blinker's on.

34
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:51,075
Good comeback, Cal.

35
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:55,163
# <i>Because I want to run that race</i>

36
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:58,875
# <i>I want to run that race</i>

37
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:02,545
# <i>I do it at my pace</i>

38
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:05,590
# <i>Long as I get to run that race</i> #

39
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,176
<i>Into the pit goes Lightning McQueen,</i>

40
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:09,594
<i>Bobby Swift and Cal Weathers.</i>

41
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,888
These three are fun to watch,
aren't they, Darrell?

42
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:14,807
You know, Bob, I can't tell
if they have more fun on or off the track.

43
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:18,936
<i>Finito!</i> Mmm.

44
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:21,314
You getting a car wash too, Cal?

45
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:24,108
No, you're getting a car wash, McQueen.

46
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:25,401
Good comeback, Cal.

47
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,488
# <i>We gotta run that race</i>

48
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,908
# <i>We gotta run that race</i>

49
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:35,411
# <i>We do it at our pace</i>

50
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:39,832
# <i>Long as we get to run that race</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i> #

51
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:43,493
Lightning, how do you keep your focus
racing against Bobby and Cal?

52
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,662
I think the key is we respect each other.

53
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:47,539
These guys are real class acts...

54
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:50,708
Congratulations, cupcake.

55
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,419
Oh, they are gonna pay.

56
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:04,137
Go, Dinoco!

57
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:05,514
Great win today, Cal.

58
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:08,225
Thank you, Shannon.
It was a great boost and I was...

59
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:10,644
Hey! Hey! Guido!

60
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:11,895
Pit stop.

61
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:14,022
Ha, ha. Laugh it up. Real funny.

62
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:23,824
Keep it going, buddy!

63
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:29,319
Whoo!

64
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:35,909
Hey! Are my sponsors happy today?

65
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,411
Stop winning for crying out loud.

66
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:39,371
We're running out of bumper cream to sell.

67
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:41,415
Lightning McQueen!

68
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:44,042
Hey, Big Tex. How's my favorite competitor?

69
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,962
Just say the word and...
I'll boot Cal off the Dinoco team

70
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:48,213
and replace him with you.

71
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,966
You know I can hear you, right?
I'm right here.

72
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:54,553
Bye, Cal. See you next week. Or not.

73
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:57,055
Oh, come on now. I'm joking.

74
00:04:57,384 --> 00:05:01,513
Go, little buddy! Whoo-hoo!
And big buddy too!

75
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:07,018
<i>Another great finish in the making.</i>

76
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,354
<i>McQueen and Swift nose to nose.</i>

77
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:11,356
How's the view back there, Bobby?

78
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:12,566
Well, you better not blink.

79
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:13,900
I'll blow right past you.

80
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:15,444
<i>The flag is out.</i>

81
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:17,696
<i>It's the final stretch. McQueen in the lead.</i>

82
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:21,575
- Okay, let's see what you got.
- Whoo-whee!

83
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:31,501
- <i>Holy cow!</i>
- <i>Whoa!</i>

84
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:35,213
<i>It's Jackson Storm for the win. A huge upset!</i>

85
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,299
<i>Neither Lightning nor
Bobby ever saw him coming.</i>

86
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:39,301
<i>It's one thing to start fast,</i>

87
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:41,511
<i>but we haven't seen anyone cross the line...</i>

88
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:44,639
<i>with that kind of speed
and power since a young...</i>

89
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:46,892
<i>Lightning McQueen first arrived on the scene.</i>

90
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:51,563
- Hey, Bobby? Who is that?
- That's, um, Jackson Storm.

91
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,106
Yeah. He's one of the rookies.

92
00:05:54,274 --> 00:05:55,275
Huh.

93
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:57,694
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

94
00:05:57,778 --> 00:05:59,946
No, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

95
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:04,868
Hey. Jackson Storm, right? Great race today.

96
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:06,703
Wow! Thank you, Mr. McQueen.

97
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,290
You have no idea what a pleasure it is
for me to finally beat you.

98
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:15,253
Oh, thanks. Wait.
Hang on. Did you say "meet" or "beat"?

99
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:19,049
- I think you heard me.
- Uh, what?

100
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:20,509
Storm, can we get some pictures?

101
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:22,260
Yeah, yeah. Come on.
Let's get a picture. You know what?

102
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:24,346
Get a ton of pictures because champ here

103
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:27,182
has been a role model of mine...
for years now.

104
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:31,353
And I mean a lot of years.
Right? I love this guy.

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,690
Storm, give us a quote.
What's your top speed?

106
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:37,567
I think I touched a nerve.

107
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,868
Welcome back to Chick's Picks
with Chick Hicks.

108
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,245
I'm your host, former and forever,

109
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,289
Piston Cup champion, Chick Hicks.

110
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,249
Doo-doo-doo-doo. This just in...

111
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,750
Rookie Jackson Storm

112
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,378
slams the proverbial door
on Lightning McQueen.

113
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,796
Oh.

114
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,883
I couldn't have enjoyed it more
if I'd beaten McQueen myself.

115
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,926
Oh, wait, I have.

116
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,887
But enough about me.

117
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,098
Here to tell you how it happened
is professional number cruncher,

118
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,600
Miss Natalie Certain.

119
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,185
It's a pleasure to be here, Chick.

120
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,438
And actually, I prefer
the term "Statistical Analyst".

121
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,734
Right. So, who is this
mysterious newcomer, Jackson Storm?

122
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,486
And why is he so darn fast?

123
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,155
It's no mystery if you study
the data, Mr. Hicks.

124
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,284
Jackson Storm is part of the next
generation of high-tech racers.

125
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,328
Unlike the veterans of yesterday...

126
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,289
What? Old-timers like this guy?

127
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,084
Um... Right. Storm achieves his top speeds

128
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,711
by exploiting the numbers.

129
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,963
I refer, of course, to racing data.

130
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,550
Tire pressure, downforce,
weight distribution, aerodynamics, and...

131
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,428
next-gens like Storm are taking advantage.

132
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:52,803
The racing world is changing.

133
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,638
And for the better if it means my old pal,

134
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:57,391
Lightning, is down for the count.
Am I right, Certain?

135
00:07:57,557 --> 00:07:59,851
Well, if I'm certain of anything, Chick...

136
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:03,480
it's that this season is about
to get even more interesting.

137
00:08:05,023 --> 00:08:06,233
<i>I'll tell you what, Darrell,</i>

138
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:08,318
<i>Jackson Storm has certainly made an impact.</i>

139
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:11,780
<i>We've got six more
next-generation rookies in the field.</i>

140
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:14,032
<i>With six veterans fired to clear the way.</i>

141
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,660
Morning, champ.
How's our living legend today?

142
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:19,871
Uh... Still very much alive, thank you.

143
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:21,957
- And I would appreciate...
- You know, I can't believe I get to race

144
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,625
the Lightning McQueen.

145
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,793
In his farewell season.

146
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:25,961
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:27,671
Oh, green flag.

148
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:30,465
Good luck out there, champ.
You're gonna need it.

149
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:40,559
<i>One reason Storm
and the next-gens are more efficient:</i>

150
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:44,303
their ability to hold the optimum
racing line every single lap.

151
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:46,722
<i>Win number three for the rookie sensation.</i>

152
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,557
<i>Storm's in a class of his own.</i>

153
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:52,477
<i>And a big reason for that: training on
the newest cutting-edge simulators.</i>

154
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:53,896
<i>These machines create a...</i>

155
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:57,858
<i>virtual racing experience so real
racers never even have to go outside.</i>

156
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:01,778
<i>Storm's ability to hold that line
is like nothing we've ever seen.</i>

157
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:04,152
<i>Four in a row? Are you kidding me?</i>

158
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:06,321
<i>2% lower drag coefficient.</i>

159
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:07,489
<i>Oh, what a finish!</i>

160
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:09,365
<i>5% increase downforce.</i>

161
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:13,078
- <i>Lucky number seven.</i>
- 1.2% higher top speed.

162
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:14,954
<i>Amazing! Nine!</i>

163
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,707
<i>Piston Cup winner, Chick Hicks here</i>

164
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,294
<i>with the racer taking the circuit...
by storm. Jackson Storm.</i>

165
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:25,298
<i>Another easy win over old "Ka-chow".
Or should I say, "Caboose"?</i>

166
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,550
<i>Because he's always in the back. Am I right?</i>

167
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,595
<i>No, no, no, Chick.
McQueen is a crafty veteran champ.</i>

168
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:32,931
<i>He's the elder statesman of the sport.
You know?</i>

169
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,517
<i>Takes everything I got to beat him.</i>

170
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,394
You got to be kidding me.

171
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:42,690
What changes are you gonna make
to get McQueen back on top?

172
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:44,192
Will McQueen try new training methods?

173
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:45,276
Is he prepared to retire?

174
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:47,487
Come on, guys. Let's not overreact.

175
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,655
It's just a slump.

176
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,156
We'll get 'em next week.

177
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,367
Okay, that's enough. No comment.

178
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,952
Not even about Weathers retiring?

179
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:55,036
Wait. What?

180
00:09:55,203 --> 00:09:57,247
Cal Weathers. He's hanging up his Lightyears.

181
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:01,584
No. No comment on that either.

182
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,669
Wait a minute.

183
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:03,753
Please, come on.
You got to give us something.

184
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,801
Hey, Cal! Hey.

185
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:12,428
Retirement? What's going on?

186
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:16,432
You know, I asked my uncle once

187
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,017
how I'd know when it was time to stop.

188
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,103
You know what he said?

189
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,730
The youngsters will tell you.

190
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,780
We had some good times together.

191
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:32,949
I'm gonna miss that the most I think.

192
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:35,827
Yeah.

193
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,252
<i>More changes ahead, Chick.</i>

194
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:47,463
Every week we've seen
veteran racers either retire...

195
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,426
like Cal Weathers tonight, or fired
to make room for these younger...

196
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:54,762
faster racers. And, it's not over yet.

197
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:56,931
<i>Hello racing fans.</i>

198
00:10:57,015 --> 00:10:59,559
<i>Welcome to the Los Angeles 500.</i>

199
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,187
<i>The final race of the Piston Cup season.</i>

200
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,189
<i>It's been a year of surprises...</i>

201
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:07,108
They can't do this.
I've raced for you guys almost 10 years.

202
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:11,404
Sorry, Brick. My mind's made up.
I'm giving your number to someone new.

203
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,114
Hey, I had two wins last year!

204
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:15,700
The whole sport's changing.
I'm just doing what I got to do.

205
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:19,078
Hey, do you know what's
happening with Brick... Oh!

206
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,624
Wait, you're not Bobby.

207
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,460
The name's Danny, bro.

208
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:40,225
Hey, champ, where'd all your friends go?

209
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,105
<i>A final check of his tires
as Storm settles into the pole position.</i>

210
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:50,068
<i>Boogity, boogity, boogity.
Let's end this season with a great race.</i>

211
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,126
That's it, buddy!

212
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:19,430
<i>Forty laps to go
and race leader, Jackson Storm...</i>

213
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:22,600
<i>is making his way onto pit road
with McQueen on his tail.</i>

214
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,479
<i>A good stop here could mean the
difference between victory and defeat.</i>

215
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:29,357
Come on, come on. Come on!
Faster, Guido, come on.

216
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:31,442
I got to get back out there before he does.

217
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:32,777
Guido, hurry up!

218
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,907
<i>What a pit stop by McQueen!</i>

219
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,492
<i>Man, he just got the lead!</i>

220
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:41,286
<i>But can he hold on to it?</i>

221
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,085
Hey, McQueen, are you all right?

222
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,628
Listen, don't you worry, pal.

223
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:53,673
You had a good run. Enjoy your retirement!

224
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:55,383
<i>Storm takes back the lead!</i>

225
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,011
<i>Unbelievable! McQueen is fading!</i>

226
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,805
<i>McQueen is fading! Fading fast!</i>

227
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:05,143
No. No! No! No!

228
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:07,645
No!

229
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:03,692
<i>W-H-L-Z</i>

230
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,318
<i>Welcome back to Piston Cup Talk.</i>

231
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:09,156
<i>Around the clock where we do nothing
but talk racing. Let's get to it.</i>

232
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,575
<i>Starting of course with Lightning McQueen.</i>

233
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:15,871
<i>With the season just two weeks away,
there's still no official announcement.</i>

234
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:19,207
<i>But with number 95 coming off
his worst year on record...</i>

235
00:14:19,374 --> 00:14:21,835
<i>Don't shoot the messenger here, folks.
I think it's safe to assume...</i>

236
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:25,331
<i>that Lightning McQueen's
racing days are over.</i>

237
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,626
<i>Meanwhile, Jackson Storm
is looking even faster...</i>

238
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,384
<i>For the checkered flag.</i>

239
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:39,888
<i>As they enter the final lap,
the number 6 and number 12 cars...</i>

240
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:44,017
<i>are still fighting it out for the lead.
But wait! Here he comes!</i>

241
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:47,187
<i>It's the Fabulous Hudson Hornet
knocking at their door.</i>

242
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:51,566
<i>What's he got up his sleeve today?
And there it is!</i>

243
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:54,486
<i>With one move, he's past them.</i>

244
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:56,404
<i>The Hornet takes a decisive lead.</i>

245
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,535
<i>He's left the pack behind.
His crew chief, Smokey, is loving it!</i>

246
00:15:02,744 --> 00:15:06,080
<i>It's unbelievable! Oh, no! He's in trouble!</i>

247
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:11,377
<i>The Hudson Hornet has lost control!</i>

248
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:18,760
<i>What should have been a scene
of jubilation has turned tragic, folks.</i>

249
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:21,346
<i>As we await news
on the Hudson Hornet's condition.</i>

250
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:23,181
<i>After such a devastating crash...</i>

251
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:26,768
<i>we can only hope that
this race today wasn't his last.</i>

252
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:36,105
<i>When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.</i>

253
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:39,733
You know what they said? You're history.

254
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,778
Moved right on to the next rookie
standing in line.

255
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,076
There was a lot left in me
I never got a chance to show.

256
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:08,387
Hey, Stickers.

257
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:10,264
Hey, Sal.

258
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:12,307
How you feeling?

259
00:16:13,475 --> 00:16:15,352
Yeah, great.

260
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:17,521
Really, really great.

261
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:20,107
Been thinking about Doc again?

262
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,280
Yeah. You know they told him
when he was done.

263
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:28,657
He didn't decide.

264
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:33,412
I don't want what happened to Doc
to happen to me.

265
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:35,080
But that hasn't happened.

266
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:40,711
No, but I can't go out on the track and
do the same old thing. It won't work.

267
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:43,005
Then change it up! Try something new.

268
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:46,759
- I don't know, Sally. I...
- Don't fear failure.

269
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:48,802
Be afraid of not having the chance.

270
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:51,346
You have the chance. Doc didn't.

271
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:55,851
And you can either take it or you can
do what you been doing. Sitting.

272
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:58,187
In here. For months.

273
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,939
And by the way,
I love what you've done with the place.

274
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:04,777
I mean the monster movie lighting
and the musky air freshener.

275
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:08,155
Don't let anyone tell you
you're not working that primer because...

276
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:10,824
Wow, I have never found you more attractive.

277
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:14,036
And now that I've been in here
for a couple minutes, the stench...

278
00:17:14,203 --> 00:17:17,706
- I'm getting kind of used to it.
- Okay, Sal. I get it. I get it.

279
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,626
I miss you, Lightning.

280
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:21,794
We all do.

281
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:28,884
Try something new, huh?

282
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:32,262
Hey, did it work, Miss Sally?

283
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:35,724
Did you set him straight with your
lawyerly powers of persuasion?

284
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:37,601
Is he ready to start training?

285
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:39,770
Well, Stinky... Stickers?

286
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:43,899
Yes, Mater, I am.

287
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,567
Whoo-hoo!

288
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:47,820
I decide when I'm done.

289
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:49,947
I was hoping you'd say that.

290
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,448
Okay, but I got an idea.

291
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,575
And I'm gonna need to talk
to Rusty and Dusty, all right?

292
00:17:54,076 --> 00:17:55,410
Oh, I'll get them on the horn.

293
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:57,162
Get it? On the horn?

294
00:17:59,206 --> 00:18:02,167
Oops. Hold on. Got to sneeze.

295
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:09,424
Dadgum, I lost it.
Hey, I'll see you at Flo's.

296
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:12,761
I found it.

297
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:14,388
Hey, watch your step.

298
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:17,006
<i>What about the car from Everett?</i>

299
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,091
<i>Remember him?</i>

300
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:19,258
<i>He was stuck in reverse!</i>

301
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:22,095
<i>I said, you need a house
with a circular driveway!</i>

302
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,431
You need to get your rusty tails down here.

303
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:27,600
I created a drink in your honor.

304
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:30,603
Yeah! The Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Bomb.

305
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,606
It goes down faster
than an elevator full of Winnebagos.

306
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:36,609
- Rusty and Dusty!
- Well, look who's here.

307
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,237
<i>Hey, there he is! Good to see you, Lightning!</i>

308
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:42,240
Thanks, guys. Wow. You're all here.

309
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:44,909
Sorry, buddy,
did you want this call to be private?

310
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:49,956
No, Mater. This is perfect. Listen,
thanks, everyone, for sticking by me.

311
00:18:50,123 --> 00:18:53,334
It took me a while to figure it out,
but I know now that it's time...

312
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:55,378
for me to make some changes.

313
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:57,421
Changes? What kind of changes?

314
00:18:57,505 --> 00:19:00,133
It's futile to resist change, man.

315
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:02,301
- You're right, Fillmore.
- Really?

316
00:19:02,468 --> 00:19:04,929
Which is why I have an announcement to make.

317
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:07,932
I've thought long and hard about it.

318
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:11,769
Done a lot of soul-searching
and considered all of the options.

319
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:14,981
And I've finally decided...

320
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:18,025
You do want to keep racing?

321
00:19:18,276 --> 00:19:20,444
Are you kidding?
Of course I want to keep racing!

322
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:22,822
- Thank goodness!
- Glad to hear it. All right.

323
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:24,198
Man, for a second I...

324
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:26,742
Wait a minute. I knew that the whole time.

325
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:29,370
Guys! I'm talking about making
this my best season yet!

326
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,164
<i>We were hoping you'd say that.</i>

327
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:34,959
The thing is, if I'm gonna be faster
than Storm, I need to train like him.

328
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:36,335
<i>We're way ahead of you, buddy!</i>

329
00:19:36,502 --> 00:19:39,172
<i>Lightning, we want you on the road
first thing in the morning...</i>

330
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:41,966
<i>so you can come out and see the brand-new...</i>

331
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,635
<i>Rust-eze Racing Center!</i>

332
00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:48,181
- <i>It's wicked awesome.</i>
- What? Rust-eze Racing Center?

333
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:52,518
<i>It's got all the fancy bells and whistles
that kids are training on these days.</i>

334
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:54,437
<i>We'll send Macky boy all the directions.</i>

335
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,189
<i>Now get moving, all right?</i>

336
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:58,733
Okay! Yes!

337
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,527
- Fancy new training center?
- That sounds nice!

338
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:03,863
Guido, come! We have to pack the tires!

339
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,782
Hey, McQueen! You can't race in primer, man.

340
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:08,034
Come on! Let's go.

341
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:14,332
Ramone, you have done it again.

342
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:17,919
It's like the Sistine Chapel on wheels.

343
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:20,713
I'm coming for you, Storm.

344
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:25,384
Morning, McQueen! Hey, look at you.

345
00:20:25,551 --> 00:20:27,011
- Oh!
- He looks so good!

346
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,599
Welcome back. You look different.

347
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:34,435
- Obviously.
- You look ready.

348
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:37,063
Guido, come! <i>Scusi, scusi.</i>
Tires coming through.

349
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,899
Go kick those rookies in the trunk.

350
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,525
All right, bye.

351
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:44,195
- Catch you on the flipside.
- I'll see you guys in Florida.

352
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:46,614
- See you, McQueen.
- Don't forget to call me.

353
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:48,908
Good luck in college.

354
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:52,161
Hey, Sal. Thanks.

355
00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:53,704
Anytime.

356
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:56,866
- Love you!
- Love you more.

357
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:59,744
Rust-eze Racing Center, here we come!

358
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:01,245
Good times ahead.

359
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,422
# <i>When the time gets right</i>

360
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,884
# <i>I'm gonna pick you up</i>

361
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:18,512
# <i>And take you far away from</i>

362
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:21,807
# <i>From trouble, my love</i>

363
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:25,269
# <i>Under a big old sky</i>

364
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:29,023
# <i>Out in a field of green</i>

365
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:33,402
# <i>There's got to be something</i>

366
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:36,572
# <i>Left for us to believe</i>

367
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:40,910
# <i>Oh, I await the day</i>

368
00:21:41,494 --> 00:21:44,622
# <i>Good fortune comes our way</i>

369
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:48,083
# <i>And we'll ride down the King's Highway</i>

370
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,629
# <i>Yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Yeah</i> #

371
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,105
McQueen, over here!

372
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:12,107
McQueen, how you feeling?

373
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:13,818
Have you seen the latest
records Storm's been setting?

374
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:15,486
Have you given any thought to retirement?

375
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:17,905
Okay, that's enough. No questions!

376
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:19,323
<i>Scusi.</i> Out of the way!

377
00:22:19,657 --> 00:22:21,992
Coming through! Okay, back up.
Back up! No pictures. No, no, no.

378
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:26,159
Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.

379
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:29,120
Guido, can you believe them?

380
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:30,830
Paparazzi.

381
00:22:42,342 --> 00:22:43,426
Wow!

382
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:45,553
Looks good, doesn't it?

383
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,555
- Hey, guys.
- What do you think?

384
00:22:48,014 --> 00:22:50,016
What do I think? It's unbelievable.

385
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:52,226
Yeah, you know, it's kind of a cozy,

386
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,020
humble, little place.

387
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:56,189
Guys, how did you ever do this?

388
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:58,816
- You want to tell him or should I?
- No, you start. Go ahead.

389
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:02,111
We sold Rust-eze. Huh?

390
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:03,863
What?

391
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,075
What? You think a couple of jabronis
like us could do this on our own?

392
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:09,494
- Wait. You sold Rust-eze?
- It's all good news.

393
00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:13,373
We just realized that you needed
something that we couldn't give you.

394
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:15,875
It felt like the time was right for us too.

395
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:17,669
I mean, we're not as young
and handsome as we look.

396
00:23:17,752 --> 00:23:19,379
Oh, that's true.

397
00:23:19,629 --> 00:23:21,005
Besides, this Sterling fellow?

398
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:23,633
He's got every high-tech thing
you'll ever need.

399
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,219
Everything we wanted to give you,
but couldn't.

400
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:28,888
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sterling? Who's Sterling?

401
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:32,558
Lightning McQueen!
You made some serious time, partner.

402
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:34,477
Your new sponsor.

403
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,480
He's the Mudflap King
of the Eastern seaboard.

404
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,233
Welcome to the Rust-eze Racing Center!

405
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,237
You have no idea how much
I've been looking forward to this.

406
00:23:44,404 --> 00:23:48,032
- Thanks, uh, Mr...
- Please. No "mister". Just Sterling.

407
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,992
I have been a fan of yours forever.

408
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:52,453
And to be your sponsor? How great is that?

409
00:23:52,537 --> 00:23:54,247
I can't thank Rusty and Dusty here enough.

410
00:23:54,372 --> 00:23:55,915
Tough negotiators by the way.

411
00:23:56,082 --> 00:23:58,084
Oh, you flatter us, but don't stop!

412
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:01,671
Anyway, just wanted to say a quick hello.

413
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:03,089
Take as much time as you need.

414
00:24:03,256 --> 00:24:04,507
Door's always open, guys.

415
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,428
See?

416
00:24:17,893 --> 00:24:21,355
I sure am gonna miss racing for you guys.

417
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:26,777
You know, you gave us
a lot of great memories, Lightning.

418
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:29,279
Memories we'll remember.

419
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:31,573
Wow. That's good.

420
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:36,537
- Hey, Lightning, whatever you do...
- Don't drive like my brother!

421
00:24:36,704 --> 00:24:38,205
Don't drive like my brother.

422
00:24:38,288 --> 00:24:39,748
Please no pictures.

423
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:42,042
Okay, maybe one.
Get my good side though, will you?

424
00:24:49,258 --> 00:24:50,801
Whoa.

425
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,152
So? You like it?

426
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:10,904
Oh, hey, Mr. Sterling. Wow.

427
00:25:11,697 --> 00:25:13,991
My career on a wall.

428
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:16,994
Nice that you included Doc.

429
00:25:17,161 --> 00:25:19,580
Of course. He was your mentor.

430
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:22,958
Losing him left a giant hole in the sport.

431
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:25,294
Yeah.

432
00:25:27,004 --> 00:25:28,172
Jars of dirt?

433
00:25:28,422 --> 00:25:29,798
Sacred dirt.

434
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,510
Each of those jars contains dirt
from all the old tracks that Doc raced on.

435
00:25:33,677 --> 00:25:37,306
Florida International, Thunder Hollow,
just down the road and...

436
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:39,933
our very own Fireball Beach, right outside.

437
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:40,976
Huh.

438
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:45,187
- Hey, is that...
- A bit of asphalt from Glen Ellen.

439
00:25:45,354 --> 00:25:46,480
My first win!

440
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,608
You really are a fan.

441
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:53,612
I am. And a fan of your future.

442
00:25:53,696 --> 00:25:54,822
You ready for it?

443
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,825
Definitely.

444
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:01,537
First, let's get you into a more...
contemporary look.

445
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:12,131
Wow.

446
00:26:12,214 --> 00:26:13,674
<i>It's an electronic suit.</i>

447
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:16,844
<i>With it we'll be able to track
your speed and your vital signs.</i>

448
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:18,178
Does it have a phone?

449
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:21,015
<i>Don't be crazy. Racecars don't have phones.</i>

450
00:26:22,516 --> 00:26:23,559
Wow.

451
00:26:23,642 --> 00:26:26,395
- Not bad, huh?
- This is really impressive.

452
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:29,398
This center has quickly become
the most coveted destination...

453
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:31,775
for young racers training
to make our team someday.

454
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:34,653
And it's where you'll train
until you leave for Florida.

455
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:38,407
Treadmills, wind tunnels, virtual reality.

456
00:26:40,075 --> 00:26:41,368
Still working on that.

457
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:44,913
And the best fitness regimen
anyone could possibly imagine.

458
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,126
Wait. Wait. Whoa. Is that the simulator?

459
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:50,461
Oh, yes.

460
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:53,756
Lightning, I'd like to introduce
you to the multi-million dollar...

461
00:26:54,256 --> 00:26:56,425
flagship of interactive race simulation.

462
00:26:57,092 --> 00:27:01,263
The XDL 24-GTS Mark Z.

463
00:27:01,764 --> 00:27:06,268
The XDL... etcetera.

464
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:09,104
Jackson Storm wishes he had this model.

465
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,322
- That was amazing.
- Awesome. Yeah!

466
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:21,116
It's just like being on a real track,
so put your hours in.

467
00:27:21,283 --> 00:27:24,620
Okay, let's hit the treadmills.
Come on. Show me what you got!

468
00:27:24,703 --> 00:27:27,122
Wow. Pretty fast. Who's the racer?

469
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:29,792
No. She's not a racer. She's a trainer.

470
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:33,212
Cruz Ramirez.
The best trainer in the business.

471
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:35,381
Ready to meet it, greet it and defeat it?

472
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:38,425
All right. Now bring up those RPMs!

473
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,302
Like the attitude.

474
00:27:40,469 --> 00:27:42,805
Yeah, we call her our maestro of motivation.

475
00:27:43,222 --> 00:27:44,807
You're driving a little tense again, Ronald.

476
00:27:45,057 --> 00:27:48,519
- No, no. I'm cool. I'm cool.
- Do your exercise.

477
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:52,022
I am a fluffy cloud! I am a fluffy cloud!

478
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:54,441
I am a fluffy cloud.

479
00:27:54,525 --> 00:27:55,734
There you go!

480
00:27:55,818 --> 00:27:57,736
- You're a cloud.
- Shut up, Kurt!

481
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:00,781
Here come the bugs, Kurt. You ready?

482
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:05,160
Hey, I kept my eyes open this time!

483
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:06,703
Got to see that track.

484
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:09,248
Oh, no. Homesick again, Gabriel?

485
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:10,416
<i>Si.</i>

486
00:28:16,255 --> 00:28:18,132
- Win for them!
- Wow.

487
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:20,592
She trains young racers
to push through their own obstacles.

488
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:24,596
Tailor-made for each one.
Now, she's gonna work with you.

489
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:27,850
Let's go! Let's go!
You guys got to work through this stuff...

490
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:29,977
so when your big chance comes along
you can take it.

491
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,270
Hey, Cruz.

492
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:32,855
Oh, hey, Mr. Sterling!

493
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:35,607
I'd like to introduce you
to Lightning McQueen.

494
00:28:35,691 --> 00:28:37,192
I hear you're the maestro.

495
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:40,446
Mr. Sterling, did you say
Lightning McQueen was here because...

496
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:42,364
I don't see him anywhere.

497
00:28:42,614 --> 00:28:45,868
Uh, but he's right here. Do you not see him?

498
00:28:46,118 --> 00:28:47,327
Nope, still don't see him.

499
00:28:47,786 --> 00:28:50,831
He's right in front of you!
It's Lightning McQueen!

500
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:56,003
He's obviously an imposter. He looks old
and broken down with flabby tires.

501
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,713
- Hey! I do not!
- Use that!

502
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,631
Whoa! Oh.

503
00:28:59,715 --> 00:29:00,799
Yeah, I see.

504
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:03,760
I can use that energy for motivation, right?

505
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:06,680
It's all about motivation, Mr. McQueen.

506
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:10,559
You can use anything negative as fuel
to push through to the positive.

507
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:13,896
I've been pretty positive
ever since I was a rookie.

508
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:15,981
I am so excited that I get to train you.

509
00:29:16,064 --> 00:29:18,233
I grew up watching you on TV.

510
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:20,360
Huh? Is that right?

511
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:23,280
These young guys are great and all,
but I like a challenge.

512
00:29:23,572 --> 00:29:25,908
I'm not that much older, but...

513
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:28,744
In fact, I call you my senior project.

514
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:34,208
We need to loosen those ancient joints.

515
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,751
First the wheels.

516
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:39,505
And forward, and rest, and forward, and rest.

517
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:41,965
Join me! Rest. And rest.

518
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:43,634
Is all this resting necessary?

519
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:46,595
We're working you in slowly.
And reach for your lunch.

520
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:48,889
Reach for your lunch.

521
00:29:48,972 --> 00:29:51,683
Now reach, to the front.

522
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,270
What is there? It's your lunch.

523
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:59,066
Now backwards. Is lunch there?

524
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:00,400
When do we go on the simulator?

525
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:03,445
Good morning, Mr. McQueen. Looking good.

526
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:06,573
Why?

527
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:10,619
This'll get oil to places
it hasn't been in a long time.

528
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:14,248
- Is that a drip pan?
- Just in case.

529
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:15,874
How old do you think I am?

530
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,877
Visualize yourself driving fast
down a steep hill.

531
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:20,212
I'll be back in a few.

532
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:24,383
Visualize... Wait. Cruz! A few what?

533
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:26,218
I just want to go on the simulator.

534
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:28,637
How's it hanging, Drip Pan?

535
00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:39,439
- 'Sup?
- Okay, day three...

536
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:43,360
Treadmill. I've set a maximum
speed to conserve your energy.

537
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:47,114
What I want you to do is
visualize beating this guy.

538
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,992
- Storm!
- Uh-huh, that's right.

539
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:51,410
Get him! Get him, Mr. McQueen!

540
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:54,538
Get him? This thing's only
going like 5 miles an hour!

541
00:30:54,746 --> 00:30:57,457
We'll work up to the higher speeds
right after you take your nap.

542
00:30:57,749 --> 00:30:59,585
Nap? I don't need a nap!

543
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:02,421
Hit him with the bugs!

544
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,798
I am not taking a nap!

545
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:06,592
<i>All cars in the test bay simulator...</i>

546
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,304
How was your nap, Mr. McQueen?

547
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:13,140
It was kind of refreshing actually.

548
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:15,350
Oh! Okay, what are you... Hey!

549
00:31:15,517 --> 00:31:17,644
You've been driving on tires a long time.

550
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:19,730
Have you ever stopped to get to know them?

551
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:20,939
I'm sorry, what?

552
00:31:21,106 --> 00:31:24,026
Tires are individuals.
You should give each a name.

553
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:27,112
Name them? I won't be doing that.

554
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:30,073
Mine are named Maria, Juanita,
Ronaldo, and Debbie Richardson.

555
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:31,700
- What?
- Long story.

556
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,202
May I have my tires back so I can go
on the simulator please?

557
00:31:34,286 --> 00:31:35,162
Name them!

558
00:31:35,412 --> 00:31:38,165
Uh, Lefty, Righty, Backy, Backy Junior. Okay?

559
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:40,000
- Does this make you mad?
- Yes, it does!

560
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,546
Use that! And merge, and yield,
and merge, and yield.

561
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:48,634
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Now you got some tire damage.

562
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:50,218
Speed bump, speed bump.

563
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:52,262
Now clean up your messy garage.

564
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:57,351
- Bug in your windshield.
- Thank you, Cruz, I'm done.

565
00:31:58,602 --> 00:32:00,270
Mr. McQueen, where are you going?

566
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:01,605
To the future.

567
00:32:04,316 --> 00:32:07,861
Okay. Here we go. How do I do this?

568
00:32:07,944 --> 00:32:09,446
- Come on, baby.
- Mr. McQueen...

569
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:12,282
Cruz, thank you for the old-man
training, as crazy as it was,

570
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:15,535
but I'm... warmed up enough
and now I need you to launch this thing.

571
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:17,996
Wait until you can handle it. Please?

572
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,289
There are no shortcuts.

573
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:21,083
Okay. We'll just see about that.

574
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:24,169
All right. My star racer is on the simulator!

575
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:25,712
Why, yes, I am!

576
00:32:25,962 --> 00:32:28,048
Well, let's see you take it out for a spin.

577
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:31,885
Right away, Mr. Sterling,
owner of the company.

578
00:32:34,554 --> 00:32:36,223
Okay. Have fun.

579
00:32:37,974 --> 00:32:39,935
This is what I'm talking about.

580
00:32:40,018 --> 00:32:41,895
Whoa. Didn't know about those.

581
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:45,899
<i>Prepare to race. The green flag is out.</i>

582
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:47,693
I don't see the flag. What do I do?

583
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:48,860
- Go.
- Go?

584
00:32:50,821 --> 00:32:51,822
Whoa.

585
00:32:52,364 --> 00:32:53,907
That's sensitive.

586
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:55,742
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

587
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:58,328
- It shouldn't be this hard, should it? Ah!
- <i>You have hit a wall.</i>

588
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,373
You're fighting the simulator.
Just race like you always do.

589
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:03,500
- <i>You have hit a wall.</i>
- Whoa.

590
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:05,043
There can't be this many walls
on a regular track!

591
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:07,916
<i>You have been passed by Jackson Storm.</i>

592
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:10,461
- Wait, Storm's in here?
- For motivation.

593
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:13,881
Storm races at 207. Pick it up, Mr. McQueen!

594
00:33:14,131 --> 00:33:15,215
I'm trying!

595
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:20,929
- Ahhh!
- <i>You have hit a wall.</i>

596
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:23,849
Mr. McQueen, come down from there
and we'll work you up to this.

597
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:26,393
I am fine, Cruz. I can do it, okay?

598
00:33:26,477 --> 00:33:27,478
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

599
00:33:28,228 --> 00:33:29,646
Ahh!

600
00:33:29,855 --> 00:33:31,315
- <i>You have jumped a barrier.</i>
- Oh!

601
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:33,817
Sorry!

602
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:35,319
<i>You have maimed two vehicles.</i>

603
00:33:35,402 --> 00:33:37,279
<i>You have destroyed a drinking fountain.</i>

604
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:42,284
<i>You have disabled an ambulance.</i>

605
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:45,954
<i>You are on fire. Danger. Danger.</i>

606
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,290
<i>You are going the wrong way.</i>

607
00:33:48,457 --> 00:33:50,167
Look out! Turn it off!

608
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:52,294
Get these things off of me!

609
00:33:56,048 --> 00:33:58,425
<i>You have crashed. You have crashed.</i>

610
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,959
- Are you all right?
- <i>You have crashed.</i>

611
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:02,585
I have crashed.

612
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:10,802
- It's not easy for him.
- Cruz, just relax.

613
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:12,429
- Give him another chance.
- I will talk to him.

614
00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:15,640
- I can still work with him.
- I know he's your project.

615
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:17,100
- Are you sure?
- Cruz.

616
00:34:17,308 --> 00:34:18,518
- Well, can't you just...
- Cruz.

617
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:19,728
It's not easy for him.

618
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:21,521
- Look, I'm trying to help you.
- Whoa.

619
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:24,357
You're all warshed up, McQueen.

620
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:26,151
I'm sorry. What?

621
00:34:27,485 --> 00:34:29,904
I said, the floor's all washed up and clean.

622
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:32,282
Oh, right.

623
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:34,200
- Thank you very much.
- Uh...

624
00:34:34,826 --> 00:34:36,244
Good luck.

625
00:34:37,203 --> 00:34:38,747
Hey, Lightning.

626
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:41,541
Come on in.
Got something to show you. You ready?

627
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:43,251
Uh, for what?

628
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,163
Wow.

629
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,959
You are about to become
the biggest brand in racing.

630
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:56,255
We are talking saturation on all
continents for every demographic.

631
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:59,550
Movie deals, infomercials,
product endorsements.

632
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:02,095
- Mudflaps?
- Of course.

633
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,139
We'll be rich beyond belief.
You think you're famous now?

634
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:09,227
I thought you'd be mad about the simulator.

635
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:12,605
I mean, this is all great, Mr. Sterling,
I guess, but I don't know.

636
00:35:12,772 --> 00:35:14,899
I've never really thought
of myself as a brand.

637
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:18,778
Oh, nor do I. I'm a fan.
Maybe your most avid.

638
00:35:18,861 --> 00:35:21,072
I think of this as your legacy!

639
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:26,911
It sounds like something that
happens after you're done racing.

640
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:31,791
Mr. Sterling, what is this about?

641
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:35,419
Look, Lightning. I'm not gonna race you.

642
00:35:35,753 --> 00:35:37,839
What? What do you mean not race me?

643
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:40,258
- Hold on. Hold on.
- I'm not going to Florida?

644
00:35:40,424 --> 00:35:45,638
You have no idea how excited I was
to get you here because...

645
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:48,391
I knew you'd be back.

646
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,102
It was gonna be the
comeback story of the year!

647
00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:55,690
But your speed and performance
just aren't where they need to be.

648
00:35:56,315 --> 00:35:57,316
I'm sorry.

649
00:35:57,608 --> 00:36:01,154
We're talking about speed on a simulator.

650
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,656
- Listen to how crazy that sounds.
- Look, I'm trying to help you.

651
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:07,034
As your sponsor, yes,
but also as your friend.

652
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:10,288
Your racing days are coming to an end.

653
00:36:10,454 --> 00:36:13,207
Every time you lose, you damage yourself.

654
00:36:13,374 --> 00:36:15,585
Damage the brand, you mean?

655
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:19,046
Oh, Lightning, come on. You've done the work.

656
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,300
Now move on to the next phase
and reap the reward.

657
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,012
The racing is the reward. Not the stuff.

658
00:36:26,637 --> 00:36:27,889
I don't want to cash in.

659
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:30,308
I want to feel the rush
of moving 200 miles an hour...

660
00:36:30,474 --> 00:36:33,644
inches from the other guys, pushing
myself faster than I thought I could go!

661
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:36,230
That's the reward, Mr. Sterling!

662
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,232
Oh, Lightning, come on.

663
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:43,237
Look, I can do this. I can, I promise!

664
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:44,989
I'll train like I did with Doc.

665
00:36:45,156 --> 00:36:48,367
I'll get my tires dirty
on every dirt track from here to Florida.

666
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:52,488
I can start on Fireball Beach
where all the old greats used to race.

667
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:54,615
Get your tires dirty.

668
00:36:54,907 --> 00:36:56,825
That's how you're gonna
get faster than Storm?

669
00:36:56,992 --> 00:37:00,662
Yes! Exactly! I mean, sacred dirt, right?

670
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:05,667
Mr. Sterling, if you care about
my legacy, the one that Doc started,

671
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:09,213
you'll let me do this.
I promise you, I will win.

672
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,716
I don't know.
What you're asking, it's too risky.

673
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:15,886
Come on. You like it, I can tell.

674
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:20,099
It's got that little "comeback story
of the year" feel to it, doesn't it?

675
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:25,437
One race?

676
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,317
If you don't win at Florida, you'll retire?

677
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:33,612
Look, if I don't win
I'll sell all the mudflaps you got.

678
00:37:33,779 --> 00:37:38,534
But if I do win,
I decide when I'm done. Deal?

679
00:37:40,411 --> 00:37:41,412
Deal.

680
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:44,790
Thank you, Mr. Sterling. You won't be sorry.

681
00:37:44,957 --> 00:37:48,085
Just one thing and this is only because
I don't like taking chances.

682
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:50,087
You're taking someone with you.

683
00:37:57,886 --> 00:38:00,722
You talked him into it!
Way to go, Mr. McQueen!

684
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:02,391
Cruz.

685
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:05,394
You could talk a snowmobile
into an air conditioner.

686
00:38:05,811 --> 00:38:07,896
You're going with me? With that thing?

687
00:38:08,105 --> 00:38:12,568
Yeah. You still need my help.
You're brittle like a fossil.

688
00:38:17,156 --> 00:38:20,951
- We got the cable.
- I don't need a trainer out here, Cruz.

689
00:38:21,577 --> 00:38:22,828
You're old!

690
00:38:22,911 --> 00:38:24,580
What if you fall on this beach
and can't get up?

691
00:38:25,122 --> 00:38:28,083
Well, life's a beach and then you drive.

692
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:32,129
- Oh, McQueen.
- Thank you.

693
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:34,173
This is beautiful.

694
00:38:34,423 --> 00:38:37,092
I can see why Mr. Sterling
said you wanted to train here.

695
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:39,094
As soon as this thing's booted up,

696
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:41,555
we'll get you on the treadmill...
and I'll track your speed.

697
00:38:41,805 --> 00:38:42,848
What? No!

698
00:38:42,931 --> 00:38:46,602
The whole idea is getting
my tires dirty. Real racing.

699
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:50,272
I'm not driving on that thing when
I've got the sand and the whole earth.

700
00:38:51,982 --> 00:38:55,110
- Oh, okay.
- Luigi, let's do this.

701
00:38:55,402 --> 00:38:58,113
Welcome, racers, to Fireball Beach!

702
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,992
Historic home for today's
great test of speed.

703
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,121
Our finish line will be
the abandoned pier in the distance.

704
00:39:06,622 --> 00:39:11,502
All right. Quicker than quick,
faster than fast, I am speed...

705
00:39:11,668 --> 00:39:15,130
That is great self-motivation.
Did you come up with that?

706
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:16,256
Yeah, I did.

707
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,635
On your mark. Get set. Go!

708
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:34,441
There you go! Felt good!

709
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:37,653
Hey, what was my speed?

710
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,155
I don't know.
I can only track you on the treadmill.

711
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:41,615
No treadmills!

712
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:43,575
Oh! What about Hamilton?

713
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:44,660
<i>Hamilton here.</i>

714
00:39:44,952 --> 00:39:47,663
Who's Hamilton?
My electronic personal assistant.

715
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:49,665
You know, like on your phone.

716
00:39:49,748 --> 00:39:51,333
You do have a phone, don't you?

717
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:54,002
Racecars don't have phones, Cruz.

718
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:56,672
Hamilton, track Mr. McQueen's
speed and report it.

719
00:39:56,838 --> 00:39:59,216
- <i>Tracking.</i>
- I'll stay as close as I can.

720
00:39:59,383 --> 00:40:01,343
Your suit will transmit
your speeds to Hamilton.

721
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,804
Fine. Whatever. Let's do this.

722
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:08,392
Quicker than quick, faster than fast,
I am speed. Come on, Luigi.

723
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:11,061
On your mark, get set, and go!

724
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:17,234
<i>46 miles per hour. 63 miles. Out of range.</i>

725
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:19,361
Huh.

726
00:40:19,444 --> 00:40:21,863
That's odd. I didn't go!

727
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:27,536
On sand you got to ease into your start
so your tires can grab, okay?

728
00:40:27,703 --> 00:40:30,581
- Okay.
- You do work with racecars, don't you?

729
00:40:30,747 --> 00:40:32,583
Yeah, but never outside.

730
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:33,709
All right. Let's go again.

731
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:35,168
Go!

732
00:40:36,712 --> 00:40:38,714
<i>54 miles per hour.</i>

733
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,258
<i>75 miles per hour. Out of range.</i>

734
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:43,218
Huh?

735
00:40:44,428 --> 00:40:47,014
Sorry! Got stuck!

736
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:49,558
- Go again!
- And go!

737
00:40:50,225 --> 00:40:52,019
- Ah! Sorry!
- Go!

738
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:53,395
Whoa!

739
00:40:53,478 --> 00:40:55,272
Go!

740
00:40:57,524 --> 00:40:58,859
The beach ate me.

741
00:40:59,109 --> 00:41:02,029
All right, Cruz, pick a line
on the compacted sand.

742
00:41:02,154 --> 00:41:04,114
You got to have traction
or you're gonna spin out.

743
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:05,574
Let's do this thing!

744
00:41:05,657 --> 00:41:07,409
On your mark, get set, go!

745
00:41:08,577 --> 00:41:10,579
<i>122 miles per hour.</i>

746
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:14,166
<i>134 miles... Out of range.</i>

747
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,377
- Now what?
- I didn't want to hit a crab!

748
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:20,422
- You got to be kidding me.
- What? It was cute!

749
00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:26,720
All right, one last chance
to try this before it gets dark.

750
00:41:26,928 --> 00:41:29,931
Now, you're going to take off
slow to let your tires grab.

751
00:41:30,098 --> 00:41:34,061
And pick a straight line on hard sand
so you don't spin out.

752
00:41:34,144 --> 00:41:37,105
And all of the crabbies
have gone night-night.

753
00:41:37,272 --> 00:41:38,357
Mr. McQueen.

754
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:39,941
All right. Let's go again.

755
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:41,443
And go!

756
00:41:44,404 --> 00:41:48,909
<i>150 miles per hour. 175 miles per hour.</i>

757
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:51,620
<i>196 miles per hour.</i>

758
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:57,167
All right! Finally! You made it!

759
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,919
Congratulations! How'd I do?

760
00:41:59,378 --> 00:42:02,297
- You topped out at 198.
- 198? That's it?

761
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:03,882
Still slower than Storm.

762
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:07,386
Wasted my whole day.

763
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:08,637
I wouldn't say that.

764
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:12,057
It did feel great to be
out here doing real racing.

765
00:42:12,307 --> 00:42:14,810
This isn't real racing. We're on a beach!

766
00:42:14,976 --> 00:42:17,562
All you do is go straight.
How am I gonna get faster if I don't...

767
00:42:20,816 --> 00:42:22,234
Thunder Hollow.

768
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:26,238
Thunder Hollow! There's a dirt track there!

769
00:42:26,405 --> 00:42:29,825
That's what I need!
To race against actual racers.

770
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,911
No! Too public! If the press find you,

771
00:42:32,994 --> 00:42:35,956
they will be like many bugs on you.

772
00:42:36,123 --> 00:42:38,667
- Paparazzi!
- Guys, I really need this!

773
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:43,463
Ah, just leave it to me, boss.
I am a master of disguise.

774
00:42:54,095 --> 00:42:56,306
All right! Next!

775
00:43:05,857 --> 00:43:08,068
You, sir, are officially incognito.

776
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:09,486
Nobody's bothering you.

777
00:43:09,861 --> 00:43:11,946
The great Lightning McQueen.

778
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,117
I can feel it, guys.
Tonight is the night I find my speed!

779
00:43:16,284 --> 00:43:20,038
<i>Racers, get on over</i>
<i>to the startin' line.</i> Pronto!

780
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:24,125
All right! No more straight lines.

781
00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:25,835
Just a good old-fashioned oval.

782
00:43:26,206 --> 00:43:27,874
Hey, now! You that out-of-towner?

783
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:31,169
Uh, yes. That's me! Chester Whipplefilter.

784
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:34,131
And I'm Frances Beltline.

785
00:43:34,298 --> 00:43:36,216
- Cruz, what are you doing?
- I'm your trainer.

786
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:39,219
I'm gonna track your speed
from the infield, Whipplefilter.

787
00:43:39,595 --> 00:43:41,430
Fine. Just stay out of the way.

788
00:43:41,597 --> 00:43:44,308
Excuse me, sir? Where are the other racers?

789
00:43:44,641 --> 00:43:46,059
Oh, they'll be along.

790
00:43:46,143 --> 00:43:50,314
We always let our guests
start right up front.

791
00:43:53,483 --> 00:43:56,361
<i>Welcome, y'all, to Thunder Hollow Speedway...</i>

792
00:43:57,112 --> 00:44:02,409
<i>for tonight's edition of Crazy Eight!</i>

793
00:44:12,294 --> 00:44:13,712
Did he say Crazy Eight?

794
00:44:13,795 --> 00:44:15,005
Whoa.

795
00:44:15,088 --> 00:44:16,214
<i>Race fans!</i>

796
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:20,135
<i>It's time to meet tonight's challengers!</i>

797
00:44:23,722 --> 00:44:25,265
Have a nice trip!

798
00:44:26,516 --> 00:44:27,976
Protect and swerve!

799
00:44:35,525 --> 00:44:37,110
Cruz! This isn't what I thought it was.

800
00:44:37,194 --> 00:44:38,445
Come on, follow me and we'll slip out.

801
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:43,608
Rule number one: the gate closes, you race.

802
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:46,277
Wait! No, no, no. I'm not a racer.

803
00:44:46,611 --> 00:44:49,238
Rule number two: last car standing wins.

804
00:44:49,405 --> 00:44:53,117
And rule number three:
no cursing! It's Family Night.

805
00:44:53,451 --> 00:44:56,370
- Excuse me, sir?
- Wait. No, I'm just a trainer!

806
00:44:56,454 --> 00:44:58,081
Whoo!

807
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:02,499
<i>And make way for
the undefeated Crazy Eight champion...</i>

808
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:07,879
<i>the Diva of Demolition, Miss Fritter!</i>

809
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:12,175
Boo!

810
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,680
Lookie here, boys.
We got us a couple of rookies.

811
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:21,685
I'm gonna call you Muddy Britches
and you Lemonade.

812
00:45:22,102 --> 00:45:24,396
Hey, neither one of them has a single dent.

813
00:45:24,563 --> 00:45:26,440
Oh, I'm gonna fix that!

814
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:33,113
<i>All right, everybody! Let's go racing!</i>

815
00:45:38,618 --> 00:45:40,996
I'm about to commit a moving violation.

816
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:42,164
Ow.

817
00:45:42,664 --> 00:45:44,541
<i>Boo!</i>

818
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:54,801
Cruz!

819
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:56,178
Ha-ha! Watch out.

820
00:45:56,803 --> 00:45:59,055
What are you doing? Got to keep moving!

821
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:00,390
I shouldn't be out here!

822
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,684
Move, Cruz! Move!

823
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:04,644
What do I do? I can't steer!

824
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:05,937
Turn right to go left! Turn right to go left!

825
00:46:06,354 --> 00:46:07,355
That doesn't make any sense!

826
00:46:07,439 --> 00:46:08,857
Turn right to go left!

827
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:13,987
Whoa.

828
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:17,657
- Hey, Patty.
- Oh, hey, Bill!

829
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:19,993
Ahhh!

830
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:31,046
Look, Ma, I can drive... Oh, man!

831
00:46:33,173 --> 00:46:34,758
Nice day for a drive, huh?

832
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,885
Hey, buddy! Get the... out of my way!

833
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:39,137
Whoo-hoo!

834
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:41,807
Hey! I'm driving...

835
00:46:48,688 --> 00:46:50,690
Oh, look at my new hat!

836
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:57,239
I'm flying! No! I'm not flying!

837
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:00,242
Get it. Get it.

838
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:01,409
I got it!

839
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,997
Cruz!

840
00:47:11,419 --> 00:47:13,088
Oh!

841
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:15,799
Hey, buddy! Move it!

842
00:47:16,758 --> 00:47:18,718
Turn right to go left. Turn right to go left.

843
00:47:19,094 --> 00:47:20,846
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

844
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:26,309
- Here I come, boy!
- No, no, no!

845
00:47:31,356 --> 00:47:32,107
Oh, no.

846
00:47:33,066 --> 00:47:34,359
<i>Buckle up, everybody!</i>

847
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,187
<i>It's Fritter time!</i>

848
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,650
Fritter! Fritter!

849
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,694
Fritter! Fritter! Fritter!

850
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,071
We love you, Miss Fritter.

851
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:52,452
Oh, yeah! Your license plate's gonna
look real nice in my collection.

852
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,496
- Oh, boy.
- Run!

853
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:56,956
Oh, no.

854
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,043
Remember, obey all appropriate street signs.

855
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:01,628
Cruz!

856
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,636
Whoa! Hey...

857
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,638
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

858
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,767
<i>Oh, my gracious! Miss Fritter's down!</i>

859
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:23,858
Nobody touches him.

860
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,069
He is mine!

861
00:48:28,029 --> 00:48:29,989
You gonna get it now, Whipplefilter!

862
00:48:32,325 --> 00:48:35,120
Come on, McQueen. You can do it.
Come on, Lightning, keep going.

863
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,039
<i>Miss Fritter is looking
to get upright, folks.</i>

864
00:48:38,581 --> 00:48:39,791
<i>And she is not pleased.</i>

865
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,669
- Get up. Get up!
- Fritter! Fritter!

866
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,339
You about to feel the wrath of the...

867
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,134
Lower Belleville County
Unified School District!

868
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,015
Oh! What the... Wait...

869
00:48:58,017 --> 00:48:59,561
No, no, no! No! No!

870
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,691
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!</i>

871
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:06,526
<i>Frances Beltline!</i>

872
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:10,029
Is that me? That's me! I won! I won!

873
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,199
- Cruz! Cruz! No!
- Ahhh! Watch out!

874
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,620
Whoa, whoa.

875
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:33,011
Whipplefilter?

876
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:40,727
It's Lightning McQueen!

877
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,063
McQueen!

878
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:49,569
<i>Fans here at Thunder Hollow
still buzzing over tonight's...</i>

879
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,905
<i>unexpected appearance of Lightning McQueen.</i>

880
00:49:52,071 --> 00:49:53,656
<i>He has always been my favorite!</i>

881
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:56,951
<i>My garage is covered from
head to toe with 95 posters.</i>

882
00:49:57,118 --> 00:49:59,370
<i>Tell our listeners at home
you weren't really trying</i>

883
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:00,997
- <i>to wreck him, were you?</i>
- So trophy's kind of nice.

884
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,207
Don't you think?

885
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,086
I mean, I know you got like
a billion of them, so you would know.

886
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:11,591
I still can't believe I won.

887
00:50:11,674 --> 00:50:13,760
It's pretty shiny.
I have never seen one up close.

888
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,012
Looks like they spent a lot of money on it.

889
00:50:16,095 --> 00:50:17,472
I mean, I think it's real metal.

890
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,266
Stop. Just stop, okay, Cruz?
You don't even know.

891
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:23,520
- You don't even have one clue...
- Hey! I was just trying...

892
00:50:23,686 --> 00:50:26,064
Do you know what happens if I lose this race?

893
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,444
Every mile of this trip was to get me
faster than Jackson Storm. Faster!

894
00:50:32,111 --> 00:50:34,739
I started off getting nowhere
for a week on a simulator!

895
00:50:34,985 --> 00:50:37,112
I lose a whole day with you
on Fireball Beach.

896
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:40,615
And then I waste tonight
in the crosshairs of Miss Fritter!

897
00:50:40,949 --> 00:50:43,368
I'm stuck in the same speed
I was a month ago!

898
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:47,748
I can't get any faster because
I'm too busy taking care of my trainer!

899
00:50:49,124 --> 00:50:53,462
This is my last chance, Cruz.
Last! Final! <i>Finito!</i>

900
00:50:53,628 --> 00:50:56,423
If I lose, I never get to do this again.

901
00:50:56,506 --> 00:50:57,966
If you were a racer...

902
00:50:58,133 --> 00:51:02,304
you'd know what I'm talking about
but you're not! So you don't.

903
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,728
Mack! Pull over!

904
00:51:10,145 --> 00:51:11,354
What? Now?

905
00:51:11,563 --> 00:51:12,773
Now!

906
00:51:13,607 --> 00:51:15,275
Ahh! Okay! Pulling over!

907
00:51:21,323 --> 00:51:24,159
Ask me if I dreamed of being a trainer,
Mr. McQueen. Go ahead.

908
00:51:25,494 --> 00:51:28,413
Ask me if I got up in the dark

909
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,540
to run laps before school every day.

910
00:51:30,707 --> 00:51:33,877
Ask me if I saved every penny to buy a ticket

911
00:51:34,002 --> 00:51:35,754
to the races when they came to town.

912
00:51:35,837 --> 00:51:40,008
Ask me if I did that so I could be
a trainer someday. Ask me.

913
00:51:41,176 --> 00:51:42,677
- Did you?
- No!

914
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:45,889
I've wanted to become a racer forever!

915
00:51:47,015 --> 00:51:48,266
Because of you!

916
00:51:53,855 --> 00:51:57,275
I used to watch you on TV,
flying through the air.

917
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:02,072
You seemed so... fearless.

918
00:52:05,408 --> 00:52:09,037
"Dream small, Cruz,"
that's what my family used to say.

919
00:52:09,704 --> 00:52:11,790
"Dream small or not at all."

920
00:52:14,543 --> 00:52:16,211
They were just trying to protect me.

921
00:52:17,546 --> 00:52:20,132
But I was the fastest kid in town

922
00:52:20,215 --> 00:52:22,509
and I was gonna prove them wrong.

923
00:52:24,511 --> 00:52:25,887
What happened?

924
00:52:27,222 --> 00:52:30,851
When I got to my first race,
I figured it out.

925
00:52:32,185 --> 00:52:33,311
What?

926
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:37,600
That I didn't belong.

927
00:52:38,518 --> 00:52:40,478
The other racers looked nothing like me.

928
00:52:42,271 --> 00:52:47,443
They were bigger and stronger
and so... confident.

929
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:54,033
And when they started their engines,
that was it...

930
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,536
I knew I'd never be a racer.

931
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:01,332
I just left.

932
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:06,087
It was my one shot and I didn't take it.

933
00:53:12,844 --> 00:53:16,264
Yeah, so, uh, I'm gonna head back
to the training center.

934
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:19,100
I think we both know it's for the best.

935
00:53:22,687 --> 00:53:24,397
But can I ask you something?

936
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:29,026
What was it like for you?

937
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,070
When you showed up to your first race?

938
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:34,031
How did you know you could do it?

939
00:53:36,074 --> 00:53:39,328
I don't know.
I just never thought I couldn't.

940
00:53:43,332 --> 00:53:45,334
I wish I knew what that felt like.

941
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:49,671
Good luck, Mr. McQueen.

942
00:53:51,089 --> 00:53:54,051
Cruz. Cruz, wait.

943
00:53:58,013 --> 00:54:01,058
<i>And earn your physics degree
from the comfort of your own home...</i>

944
00:54:01,224 --> 00:54:04,478
<i>You'll get that and a $200 gift, for $29.95.</i>

945
00:54:04,644 --> 00:54:05,771
<i>Now look here, Warden...</i>

946
00:54:05,854 --> 00:54:06,980
<i>Oh, no! He's got a jack!</i>

947
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:10,273
<i>Autos over 100,000 miles
also reported trouble sleeping.</i>

948
00:54:10,439 --> 00:54:13,901
<i>You could have 12 worn-out wrenches
or you could have one atomic wrench.</i>

949
00:54:14,068 --> 00:54:15,653
<i>Throw the old ones out. This covers...</i>

950
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,822
<i>"Champion for the Ages" Chick Hicks here.</i>

951
00:54:18,072 --> 00:54:20,157
<i>Coming to you live from...
Chick Hicks Studios,</i>

952
00:54:20,241 --> 00:54:21,367
<i>where I'm joined once again by...</i>

953
00:54:21,534 --> 00:54:23,494
<i>next-gen racing expert, Natalie Certain.</i>

954
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:28,207
<i>Thanks, Chick. Piston Cup champion
Jackson Storm set a new record today...</i>

955
00:54:28,374 --> 00:54:31,002
<i>when he pulled off
the fastest lap ever recorded.</i>

956
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:34,922
<i>An unprecedented 213 miles an hour.</i>

957
00:54:35,715 --> 00:54:37,633
<i>Wow! So what do you think, Certain?</i>

958
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,303
Stormy boy gonna start
the season with another win?

959
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:41,554
Highly likely, Chick.

960
00:54:41,637 --> 00:54:43,973
Based on his recent run times
and forecasted...

961
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,349
track temperatures on race day,

962
00:54:45,433 --> 00:54:49,020
Storm's chances of winning... are 95.2%.

963
00:54:49,468 --> 00:54:50,469
That low, huh?

964
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:54,598
Oh, and in case you missed it, talk of
the track tonight is Lightning McQueen...

965
00:54:54,765 --> 00:54:59,311
finding yet another way to embarrass
himself at a demolition derby. Whoa.

966
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:01,772
Almost makes me feel sorry for the guy.

967
00:55:01,856 --> 00:55:02,857
Not really.

968
00:55:03,524 --> 00:55:04,775
Here's what his new sponsor had to say.

969
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:07,528
Everyone, relax. The 95's gonna race.

970
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:11,407
Lightning's just taking a somewhat
unconventional approach to this race.

971
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:12,950
It's one of the things
his fans love about him.

972
00:55:14,194 --> 00:55:16,154
<i>Yeah, right! Talk about humiliating.</i>

973
00:55:16,404 --> 00:55:19,658
<i>If I were old Ka-chow... I wouldn't
even bother to show up in Florida.</i>

974
00:55:19,824 --> 00:55:22,160
<i>That could be for the best, Chick.
Even if he does race...</i>

975
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:26,331
<i>McQueen's probability of winning is 1.2%.</i>

976
00:55:26,414 --> 00:55:27,415
<i>Wow!</i>

977
00:55:27,832 --> 00:55:29,960
<i>Numbers never lie.</i>

978
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:32,754
<i>I'm willing to predict tonight
that Lightning McQueen's racing...</i>

979
00:55:32,921 --> 00:55:36,258
<i>career will be over within the week.</i>

980
00:55:36,341 --> 00:55:37,801
<i>It might even be over now.</i>

981
00:55:37,926 --> 00:55:39,844
<i>I mean, I knew his career
was stuck in the mud...</i>

982
00:55:44,057 --> 00:55:45,934
# <i>First you find a can from a rusty van</i>

983
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:47,018
# <i>Bump-bump</i>

984
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:48,812
# <i>Quicker than a dart, make it into art</i>

985
00:55:48,895 --> 00:55:49,896
# <i>Bump-bump</i>

986
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,314
# <i>That's the way it's done, it's a lot of fun</i>

987
00:55:51,398 --> 00:55:52,357
# <i>Bump-bump</i>

988
00:55:52,524 --> 00:55:54,859
# <i>Liftin' my funk,</i>
<i>makin' sculpture outta junk</i> #

989
00:55:56,945 --> 00:55:59,406
What's that? There we go!

990
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:00,156
Somebody's interrupting genius!

991
00:56:02,364 --> 00:56:05,033
- Well, hey, there, buddy!
- <i>Mater!</i>

992
00:56:05,117 --> 00:56:08,578
You know, I was just thinking of you
and here you are lookin' right at me!

993
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:12,541
<i>You see me okay? Hang on a second
there. Hold on. Let me see here.</i>

994
00:56:13,834 --> 00:56:15,085
<i>That better?</i>

995
00:56:15,585 --> 00:56:17,879
Looking you straight in the eye there, pal.

996
00:56:17,963 --> 00:56:20,298
Hey, sorry about calling so late.

997
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:22,085
Shoot, not for me it's not.

998
00:56:22,169 --> 00:56:24,046
I'm always burning that midnight oil.

999
00:56:24,212 --> 00:56:26,339
So get me caught up on everything.

1000
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,926
Well, actually kind of hoping
I might hear what's going on back home.

1001
00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:34,681
Not much. If you don't count Sarge
and Fillmore tryin' to run the tire shop.

1002
00:56:34,848 --> 00:56:38,185
But tell Luigi not to worry,
Sarge is gonna track down...

1003
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:40,771
every last tire
that Fillmore done gived away.

1004
00:56:41,563 --> 00:56:43,523
<i>Other than that, everything's good.</i>

1005
00:56:43,607 --> 00:56:45,275
- How's Sally?
- <i>Oh, she's fine.</i>

1006
00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:48,111
<i>Keeping busy at the Cone. She misses you.</i>

1007
00:56:48,278 --> 00:56:50,989
<i>Well, shoot! We all do
when you're on the road.</i>

1008
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,495
Yeah. You know, I've been
kind of thinking about that.

1009
00:56:56,661 --> 00:56:59,956
You know, what we should do
when I'm not on the road anymore.

1010
00:57:00,624 --> 00:57:02,042
<i>What do you mean not on the road?</i>

1011
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:04,920
Well, you know.

1012
00:57:06,129 --> 00:57:07,839
Mater, I can't do this forever.

1013
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:09,591
Huh?

1014
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:13,804
I'm just not getting anywhere
with the training.

1015
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:16,181
If anything, I've gotten slower not faster.

1016
00:57:16,848 --> 00:57:18,725
<i>Shoot, buddy, it'll work out.</i>

1017
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:20,060
<i>Just tell me what the problem is...</i>

1018
00:57:20,227 --> 00:57:22,437
<i>and I'll stay right here
with you until we fix it.</i>

1019
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:25,273
That's just it, Mater. I don't know.

1020
00:57:26,066 --> 00:57:27,984
And I feel like I'm all out of ideas.

1021
00:57:28,735 --> 00:57:29,945
<i>Hmm.</i>

1022
00:57:30,028 --> 00:57:33,115
<i>All right, let me think.
Oh! You know what I'd do?</i>

1023
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:34,491
What?

1024
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:38,161
<i>I don't know. I got nothin'.</i>

1025
00:57:38,495 --> 00:57:40,413
<i>I guess I ain't Doc when it comes to that.</i>

1026
00:57:41,832 --> 00:57:44,751
I would give anything
to talk to him right now.

1027
00:57:44,918 --> 00:57:47,546
<i>Yep, there was nobody smarter than old Doc.</i>

1028
00:57:47,712 --> 00:57:49,422
<i>Well, except for maybe whoever taught him.</i>

1029
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:51,883
Yeah. Wait. What?

1030
00:57:52,467 --> 00:57:54,427
<i>Everybody was taught by somebody, right?</i>

1031
00:57:54,511 --> 00:57:55,637
<i>Take my cousin Doyle.</i>

1032
00:57:56,138 --> 00:57:58,348
<i>He taught me how to sing
and whistle at the same time.</i>

1033
00:57:58,515 --> 00:57:59,933
<i>He was very musical that way.</i>

1034
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,103
Smokey. Mater, you're brilliant.

1035
00:58:03,353 --> 00:58:06,648
<i>Ah, well... It's all about
the shape of your teeth.</i>

1036
00:58:06,815 --> 00:58:08,150
I got to go to Thomasville.

1037
00:58:08,316 --> 00:58:09,609
<i>Oh, well, good.</i>

1038
00:58:09,693 --> 00:58:12,112
You know me, buddy, I'm always happy to help.

1039
00:58:12,279 --> 00:58:16,032
Think I am better at that than most folks.
You know, talkin' and stuff.

1040
00:58:31,798 --> 00:58:32,799
Hey, Cruz.

1041
00:58:33,466 --> 00:58:35,218
You won't talk me out of this, Mr. McQueen.

1042
00:58:35,385 --> 00:58:37,846
I'm going back. I resign as your trainer.

1043
00:58:38,513 --> 00:58:42,392
All right. I accept your resignation. Bye.

1044
00:58:43,143 --> 00:58:44,978
Oh... Okay.

1045
00:58:45,812 --> 00:58:49,566
But since you cleared your calendar,
why don't you come with us?

1046
00:58:49,733 --> 00:58:51,776
I'm looking for someone named Smokey.

1047
00:58:51,943 --> 00:58:55,280
Hoping he can help me.
Maybe he can help you too.

1048
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,781
Nah.

1049
00:58:56,948 --> 00:59:00,118
Come on. I fixed it.

1050
00:59:01,286 --> 00:59:03,663
No. Thanks anyway. But I'm done.

1051
00:59:04,122 --> 00:59:08,376
Okay. But maybe this will
change your mind. Hit it.

1052
00:59:10,003 --> 00:59:12,631
First I'm going to loosen up
these ancient joints...

1053
00:59:12,797 --> 00:59:14,174
No, please don't.

1054
00:59:14,257 --> 00:59:15,884
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1055
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:17,844
I'm sorry that I yelled.

1056
00:59:17,928 --> 00:59:21,348
It wasn't your fault
that I almost got killed.

1057
00:59:21,431 --> 00:59:24,684
But now you're leaving
and you won't get on the ramp.

1058
00:59:24,851 --> 00:59:26,061
- All right, I'll go.
- You won't get on the ramp.

1059
00:59:26,144 --> 00:59:27,145
All right, I'll go! Just stop!

1060
00:59:32,776 --> 00:59:34,527
How do you know Smokey's going to be here?

1061
00:59:34,694 --> 00:59:36,029
I don't.

1062
00:59:36,404 --> 00:59:39,282
Oh. Do you know if he's even alive?

1063
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:40,951
Nope.

1064
00:59:41,618 --> 00:59:42,661
Okay.

1065
00:59:43,995 --> 00:59:46,748
So tell me this: how do you know
if it's Smokey? Is there such...

1066
00:59:46,915 --> 00:59:49,084
Wait. Mack, pull over!

1067
00:59:49,209 --> 00:59:50,585
Back it up! Back it up.

1068
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:09,521
Good to see you, Doc.

1069
01:00:10,021 --> 01:00:12,774
Hey, isn't that your old crew chief?

1070
01:00:13,608 --> 01:00:16,861
Hey, Cruz? You want to
check out the home track

1071
01:00:16,986 --> 01:00:18,738
of the greatest racer ever?

1072
01:00:21,324 --> 01:00:24,202
Aren't we supposed to be looking for Smokey?

1073
01:00:24,285 --> 01:00:26,287
Oh, that's right, he's dead.

1074
01:00:26,454 --> 01:00:28,248
We don't know that.

1075
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,341
Are you sure you have time for this?

1076
01:00:39,217 --> 01:00:41,886
For this, I do.

1077
01:01:00,154 --> 01:01:01,364
Wow!

1078
01:01:02,406 --> 01:01:04,158
If this track could talk.

1079
01:01:07,787 --> 01:01:11,165
Cruz, what do you say? Let's take a lap.

1080
01:01:11,332 --> 01:01:14,377
Oh, yeah!

1081
01:01:19,465 --> 01:01:20,967
Oh, whoa!

1082
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:38,859
Yes! You nailed it!

1083
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:41,779
Way easier without the school bus
of death trying to kill us!

1084
01:01:42,029 --> 01:01:43,239
Yeah, no kidding!

1085
01:02:00,086 --> 01:02:02,505
Was starting to think I might never meet you.

1086
01:02:03,381 --> 01:02:04,382
Smokey?

1087
01:02:08,428 --> 01:02:10,222
He is alive.

1088
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:15,185
I know why you're here. You're thirsty.

1089
01:02:19,481 --> 01:02:20,607
I'll tell you what,

1090
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:23,485
these folks are gonna get a kick
out of meeting Hud's boy.

1091
01:02:23,652 --> 01:02:28,240
Who's Hud? Oh, Doc Hudson! Right.

1092
01:02:30,408 --> 01:02:32,285
Hey!

1093
01:02:32,953 --> 01:02:34,955
Act civilized. We got company.

1094
01:02:35,205 --> 01:02:38,041
Hey, Les. How's that back axle treating you?

1095
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:39,709
Hey, sugar, welcome to Thomasville.

1096
01:02:41,795 --> 01:02:44,172
- Would you look at that?
- What?

1097
01:02:44,339 --> 01:02:46,591
Three of the biggest racing legends ever!

1098
01:02:47,008 --> 01:02:49,970
Junior "Midnight" Moon.
River Scott. Louise...

1099
01:02:50,053 --> 01:02:52,472
Louise "Barnstormer" Nash? She had 38 wins!

1100
01:02:52,973 --> 01:02:56,142
Well, as I live and breathe.
If it ain't Lightning McQueen.

1101
01:02:56,351 --> 01:02:58,353
Ms. Nash, it's a pleasure to meet you...

1102
01:02:58,603 --> 01:02:59,646
You've had a tough year, haven't you?

1103
01:02:59,854 --> 01:03:00,939
Oh, uh...

1104
01:03:01,022 --> 01:03:03,817
Shouldn't you be running practice laps
in Florida by now?

1105
01:03:04,234 --> 01:03:06,569
- Yeah, sure, but...
- They're here to steal our secrets.

1106
01:03:06,736 --> 01:03:08,363
Looking for your lost mojo?

1107
01:03:08,863 --> 01:03:11,324
Wow. You don't mince words
around here, do you?

1108
01:03:12,784 --> 01:03:14,577
Truth is always quicker, kid.

1109
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:23,378
# <i>But all he kept talking about was</i>

1110
01:03:23,461 --> 01:03:25,088
# <i>Glory days</i>

1111
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:29,467
# <i>They'll pass you by Glory days</i>

1112
01:03:29,634 --> 01:03:31,761
# <i>In the wink of a young girl's eye</i>

1113
01:03:31,845 --> 01:03:33,305
# <i>Glory days</i>

1114
01:03:33,471 --> 01:03:36,224
# <i>Glory days</i> #

1115
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:37,851
Guido, she's an angel.

1116
01:03:39,185 --> 01:03:40,687
Lou won't admit this,

1117
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:44,232
but she used to have serious eyes for Hud.

1118
01:03:44,816 --> 01:03:45,859
Oh, really?

1119
01:03:45,984 --> 01:03:47,777
Even if I did, it wouldn't have mattered.

1120
01:03:47,944 --> 01:03:50,655
Hud didn't like fast women.
And that left me out.

1121
01:03:51,865 --> 01:03:54,492
Old Lou wasn't just fast, she was fearless.

1122
01:03:54,743 --> 01:03:57,829
The second I saw my first race,
I just knew I had to get in there.

1123
01:03:57,996 --> 01:04:02,417
Of course, the fellas in charge
didn't like a lady racer showin' them up.

1124
01:04:02,584 --> 01:04:04,127
So they wouldn't let me have a number.

1125
01:04:04,377 --> 01:04:05,545
What did you do?

1126
01:04:05,837 --> 01:04:07,047
I stole one!

1127
01:04:07,255 --> 01:04:08,340
- What?
- Wow.

1128
01:04:08,715 --> 01:04:11,509
Life's too short to take no
for an answer. Right, River?

1129
01:04:11,676 --> 01:04:14,554
If we had waited for an invitation,
we might've never raced.

1130
01:04:14,721 --> 01:04:17,140
And once we got on the track,
we didn't want to leave.

1131
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:18,933
I think that's how Doc felt too.

1132
01:04:19,142 --> 01:04:21,186
You should've seen him
when he first came to town.

1133
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:23,104
Shiny blue paint.

1134
01:04:23,271 --> 01:04:24,647
Not just the Hudson Hornet.

1135
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:26,566
He was already calling himself...

1136
01:04:26,733 --> 01:04:28,902
...the Fabulous Hudson Hornet.

1137
01:04:28,985 --> 01:04:30,236
Whoo-hoo!

1138
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:32,322
Did we ever ride him on that.

1139
01:04:32,489 --> 01:04:33,490
Not for long.

1140
01:04:33,573 --> 01:04:36,451
Hud was the fastest racer
this side of the Mississippi.

1141
01:04:36,743 --> 01:04:38,078
Until he wasn't.

1142
01:04:38,578 --> 01:04:39,579
What?

1143
01:04:40,747 --> 01:04:43,083
Everything changed when the rookie showed up.

1144
01:04:49,672 --> 01:04:52,675
<i>Took Hud all of no time to work
his way through the best racers...</i>

1145
01:04:52,759 --> 01:04:54,344
<i>in both Carolinas.</i>

1146
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:59,099
<i>Past River. Past Lou. Even Junior.</i>

1147
01:05:01,351 --> 01:05:03,311
<i>But there was still the rookie to deal with.</i>

1148
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:08,191
<i>Tried slamming him into the wall.</i>

1149
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,862
<i>But Hud never touched any wall,</i>

1150
01:05:12,987 --> 01:05:14,114
<i>unless he wanted to.</i>

1151
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:28,169
That rookie never saw
anything like that before.

1152
01:05:28,336 --> 01:05:30,547
- Doc did that?
- Whoa! Are you kidding?

1153
01:05:30,797 --> 01:05:33,883
Couldn't wipe the smile off his face
for a week after that.

1154
01:05:35,885 --> 01:05:37,971
I wish I could've seen him like that.

1155
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:42,016
- Like what?
- So happy.

1156
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:52,152
You didn't come all this way
for a quart of oil, did you?

1157
01:05:53,486 --> 01:05:55,363
I need your help, Smokey.

1158
01:05:56,072 --> 01:05:58,533
Yeah? What kind of help?

1159
01:05:59,868 --> 01:06:02,954
That's just it, I'm not sure.

1160
01:06:03,037 --> 01:06:05,081
All I know is if I lose in Florida...

1161
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:08,042
it's over for me.

1162
01:06:08,126 --> 01:06:10,336
What happened to Doc will happen to me.

1163
01:06:11,504 --> 01:06:13,173
What did happen to him?

1164
01:06:14,507 --> 01:06:18,553
You know,
racing was the best part of his life.

1165
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,430
And when it ended, he...

1166
01:06:21,764 --> 01:06:24,225
Well, we both know he was
never the same after that.

1167
01:06:26,227 --> 01:06:27,854
Is that what you think?

1168
01:06:29,856 --> 01:06:32,525
Come on. I want to show you something.

1169
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:40,450
You got the first part right.

1170
01:06:41,117 --> 01:06:43,286
The crash broke Hud's body

1171
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:45,538
and the "no more racing" broke his heart.

1172
01:06:46,206 --> 01:06:47,582
He cut himself off.

1173
01:06:47,665 --> 01:06:49,626
Disappeared to Radiator Springs.

1174
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:52,879
Son of a gun didn't talk to me for 50 years.

1175
01:06:53,546 --> 01:06:57,300
But then one day,
the letters started coming in.

1176
01:07:09,845 --> 01:07:12,556
And every last one of them was about you.

1177
01:07:15,434 --> 01:07:18,520
Yeah, Hud loved racing.

1178
01:07:19,563 --> 01:07:20,731
But coaching you?

1179
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:24,568
I had never seen the old grump so happy.

1180
01:07:28,614 --> 01:07:31,575
Racing wasn't the best part of Hud's life.

1181
01:07:33,076 --> 01:07:34,453
You were.

1182
01:07:38,707 --> 01:07:40,292
You ready to blow out
a little carbon there, boy?

1183
01:07:40,417 --> 01:07:41,251
Yes, I am!

1184
01:07:44,588 --> 01:07:46,798
You give it too much throttle,
you're in the tulips.

1185
01:07:48,592 --> 01:07:51,303
Hey, Lightning. You might want
to take notes on this one.

1186
01:08:03,935 --> 01:08:05,937
<i>You got a lot of stuff, kid.</i>

1187
01:08:22,036 --> 01:08:26,124
Hud saw something in you
that you don't even see in yourself.

1188
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:29,836
Are you ready to go find it?

1189
01:08:30,795 --> 01:08:32,171
Yes, sir.

1190
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:42,719
All right, all right. Bring it back.

1191
01:08:45,848 --> 01:08:48,976
Lesson one: You're old. Accept it.

1192
01:08:49,143 --> 01:08:51,395
- I told him that.
- He's probably losing his hearing.

1193
01:08:51,478 --> 01:08:53,063
He said you're old and losing...

1194
01:08:53,147 --> 01:08:54,231
I heard him.

1195
01:08:54,314 --> 01:08:56,567
You'll never be as fast as Storm,

1196
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:58,402
but you can be smarter than him.

1197
01:08:58,986 --> 01:09:00,904
Okay, what do I do?

1198
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:03,365
They said you were in a demolition derby.

1199
01:09:03,532 --> 01:09:05,075
Yeah, it was terrible and I almost...

1200
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:07,661
Are you sure?
Because there's not a scratch on you.

1201
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:13,657
Funny what a racer can do
when he's not over-thinking things.

1202
01:09:15,867 --> 01:09:19,246
<i>Shannon Spokes here at Florida
International, where Jackson Storm...</i>

1203
01:09:19,413 --> 01:09:22,499
<i>clocked 214 miles per hour today.</i>

1204
01:09:27,412 --> 01:09:30,498
You want to beat Storm,
you need someone to stand in for him.

1205
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:32,166
Like a sparring partner.

1206
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:36,170
I'm not so sure. Not a racer. Just a trainer!

1207
01:09:36,337 --> 01:09:37,255
Go ahead and gun it.

1208
01:09:42,218 --> 01:09:43,720
Oh, yeah!

1209
01:09:43,928 --> 01:09:46,264
With no muffler you even sound like Storm.

1210
01:09:47,056 --> 01:09:49,183
Oh, you're going down, McQueen!

1211
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,519
Get that arthritis-riddled keister
onto the track

1212
01:09:51,686 --> 01:09:54,522
so I can put you into...
the old folks' home against your will!

1213
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:57,066
How was that?

1214
01:09:57,859 --> 01:09:59,402
- That'll work.
- Worked for me.

1215
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:01,112
- I'm good.
- Yep. That'll do.

1216
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:01,946
Did you hear what she said?

1217
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,366
You didn't show up in Florida for qualifying

1218
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,243
so you'll be starting last.

1219
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:09,662
I'll give you three laps to catch her.

1220
01:10:09,912 --> 01:10:12,457
Go through the entire field in three laps?

1221
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:14,208
You want to beat Storm or not?

1222
01:10:14,459 --> 01:10:17,920
- Yes! Of course I do.
- Well, then, go!

1223
01:10:19,547 --> 01:10:20,715
Come on, kid.

1224
01:10:31,551 --> 01:10:34,596
All right. Looks like we got some work to do.

1225
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,600
Look alive. The reflexes
are the first thing to go.

1226
01:10:41,353 --> 01:10:43,230
Ah!

1227
01:10:44,648 --> 01:10:45,899
Why are we in a field?

1228
01:10:46,483 --> 01:10:48,402
Sneak through that window!

1229
01:10:48,485 --> 01:10:50,153
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

1230
01:10:50,278 --> 01:10:50,987
Go!

1231
01:10:56,576 --> 01:10:57,577
Whoa!

1232
01:11:00,449 --> 01:11:02,743
Not cool, man. Not cool!

1233
01:11:07,122 --> 01:11:08,249
Let's run it back.

1234
01:11:10,668 --> 01:11:12,586
Do you even want to be out here?

1235
01:11:15,464 --> 01:11:17,007
Only two days left, kid.

1236
01:11:17,091 --> 01:11:19,093
You got to work harder.

1237
01:11:22,843 --> 01:11:24,136
Wait, wait, who was that?

1238
01:11:24,303 --> 01:11:25,513
I put McQueen in there.

1239
01:11:25,596 --> 01:11:27,097
Give you some real competition.

1240
01:11:30,935 --> 01:11:33,062
Hud was a master of letting the other cars

1241
01:11:33,229 --> 01:11:34,355
do the work for him.

1242
01:11:34,438 --> 01:11:37,191
He used to say cling to 'em
like you was two June bugs...

1243
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:38,609
on a summer night.

1244
01:11:38,776 --> 01:11:40,027
He stole that from me.

1245
01:11:40,528 --> 01:11:42,905
Drafting? I've never had to do that.

1246
01:11:42,988 --> 01:11:45,574
Yeah, that's when you were fast.

1247
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:47,034
Now you're slow.

1248
01:11:47,117 --> 01:11:48,827
- And old.
- And rickety.

1249
01:11:48,911 --> 01:11:50,746
- And dilapidated.
- Okay! Okay, I get it.

1250
01:11:50,829 --> 01:11:53,082
The new you has to look for opportunities...

1251
01:11:53,165 --> 01:11:54,959
you never knew were there.

1252
01:11:57,962 --> 01:12:00,130
Sneak through the window!

1253
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,133
Sneak through the window.

1254
01:12:03,217 --> 01:12:04,218
What?

1255
01:12:04,301 --> 01:12:06,554
When a window opens, take it!

1256
01:12:11,807 --> 01:12:12,808
Whoa!

1257
01:12:15,978 --> 01:12:16,729
Yes.

1258
01:12:17,772 --> 01:12:20,399
- Whoa! I made it!
- All right!

1259
01:12:21,942 --> 01:12:23,319
Let's go! Let's move!

1260
01:12:24,612 --> 01:12:25,613
Reflexes!

1261
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,158
All right, Guido, turn up the heat.

1262
01:12:29,366 --> 01:12:30,326
Okay.

1263
01:12:31,035 --> 01:12:32,369
Whoa! Whoa!

1264
01:12:37,248 --> 01:12:39,751
All right, look who finally showed up.

1265
01:12:43,004 --> 01:12:45,090
This is where we cut our racing teeth.

1266
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:46,716
In the woods?

1267
01:12:46,883 --> 01:12:50,595
Let's just say the moon
was always shining on us.

1268
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:51,680
Huh?

1269
01:12:51,763 --> 01:12:54,557
If the moon didn't shine,
we didn't have to...

1270
01:12:54,641 --> 01:12:55,642
Oh, never mind.

1271
01:12:55,725 --> 01:12:57,519
We ran moonshine, dummy!

1272
01:12:57,602 --> 01:12:58,645
Oh!

1273
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:02,023
By the way, no lights. Instinct only.

1274
01:13:04,526 --> 01:13:05,193
Yeah!

1275
01:13:09,531 --> 01:13:10,699
Yeah!

1276
01:13:15,161 --> 01:13:16,204
Oh!

1277
01:13:21,292 --> 01:13:22,293
Whoa!

1278
01:13:22,377 --> 01:13:24,045
Yeah!

1279
01:13:29,718 --> 01:13:30,844
Whoo-hoo!

1280
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:38,137
All right!

1281
01:13:50,567 --> 01:13:51,651
McQueen's still not here?

1282
01:13:51,734 --> 01:13:53,403
Didn't he pull this when he was a rookie?

1283
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:55,446
At least that's what my grandfather told me.

1284
01:13:55,947 --> 01:13:58,074
All right, we got time for one last race.

1285
01:13:59,075 --> 01:14:01,744
Hurry this along, boss,
we got to get you to Florida.

1286
01:14:01,911 --> 01:14:03,037
Go!

1287
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:10,920
Maybe it's best that he doesn't show up,
after how last season ended.

1288
01:14:15,258 --> 01:14:16,509
Let me put it this way.

1289
01:14:16,676 --> 01:14:19,804
I'm not losing any sleep
wondering where Lightning McQueen is.

1290
01:14:25,259 --> 01:14:26,594
Come on, boy. Come on!

1291
01:14:34,643 --> 01:14:36,437
All right, McQueen. There you go, boy!

1292
01:14:36,604 --> 01:14:38,022
There you go.

1293
01:14:48,866 --> 01:14:53,871
<i>McQueen is fading.
McQueen is fading. Fading fast.</i>

1294
01:14:59,376 --> 01:15:01,128
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

1295
01:15:01,211 --> 01:15:02,254
Ah!

1296
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:06,634
Whoo! Did you see that? That was...

1297
01:15:13,265 --> 01:15:14,475
Uh...

1298
01:15:15,017 --> 01:15:16,977
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

1299
01:15:20,814 --> 01:15:24,902
Hey, uh, boss, it's time to hit the road.

1300
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:28,155
Yeah.

1301
01:15:31,075 --> 01:15:33,994
I want to thank everyone for the training.

1302
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:37,998
We better get going to Florida.

1303
01:15:48,341 --> 01:15:50,593
<i>Welcome to racing's greatest day!</i>

1304
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,680
<i>We're beach-side
at the Florida International Speedway...</i>

1305
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:56,182
<i>to kick off a new season
of Piston Cup racing.</i>

1306
01:15:56,266 --> 01:15:58,059
<i>It's the Florida 500.</i>

1307
01:15:58,142 --> 01:16:01,646
<i>Forty-three cars and a quarter million
fans await today's intense contest of...</i>

1308
01:16:01,729 --> 01:16:03,857
<i>strategy, skill, but most of all, speed.</i>

1309
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:06,192
<i>This crowd is in for one great day of racing.</i>

1310
01:16:06,526 --> 01:16:09,362
<i>I'm Bob Cutlass, joined as always
by my broadcasting partner...</i>

1311
01:16:09,897 --> 01:16:13,317
Darrell Cartrip and stat
sensation Natalie Certain.

1312
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,111
I've never seen the numbers line up
for Storm like they do today, Bob.

1313
01:16:16,195 --> 01:16:20,074
Storm should be 96.8% unstoppable.

1314
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,492
<i>Well, don't overlook Lightning McQueen.</i>

1315
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:22,868
Whipplefilter! Yeah-hoo!

1316
01:16:24,536 --> 01:16:27,706
<i>We've heard stories of the unusual way
McQueen trained to get here.</i>

1317
01:16:28,582 --> 01:16:30,793
<i>Now the question is did it work?</i>

1318
01:16:39,257 --> 01:16:44,804
Speed. I am... speed?

1319
01:16:49,934 --> 01:16:51,686
Hey, boss, they're, uh...

1320
01:16:51,769 --> 01:16:53,730
calling the racers to the track.

1321
01:16:56,983 --> 01:16:59,152
Jeff Gorvette,
how does today's talent stack up?

1322
01:16:59,235 --> 01:17:00,570
Oh, I think we're in for a treat today.

1323
01:17:00,653 --> 01:17:01,696
These racers are...

1324
01:17:01,779 --> 01:17:04,532
Oh... Hey, McQueen, win one for us old guys.

1325
01:17:04,615 --> 01:17:06,367
Hah! Will do, Jeff.

1326
01:17:06,451 --> 01:17:08,453
- Hey, there, buddy!
- Hey, guys.

1327
01:17:08,911 --> 01:17:11,622
- Stickers.
- Hey, Sal.

1328
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:15,251
- You okay?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

1329
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:18,713
Listen, you're gonna do great today.

1330
01:17:18,796 --> 01:17:20,506
And no matter what happens...

1331
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:23,217
I'm going to move onto the next rookie
and forget I ever knew you.

1332
01:17:25,261 --> 01:17:26,512
I'm glad you're here.

1333
01:17:26,596 --> 01:17:31,517
Oh, wow! Nice costume.
Come here, let's get a picture.

1334
01:17:31,601 --> 01:17:33,770
It's so great to meet my number-one fan.

1335
01:17:34,187 --> 01:17:35,605
What a jerk.

1336
01:17:35,688 --> 01:17:38,691
- She's not a fan, Storm.
- Oh, hey there, champ.

1337
01:17:38,775 --> 01:17:41,027
I heard you're selling mudflaps after today.

1338
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:42,195
Is that true?

1339
01:17:42,278 --> 01:17:44,655
Hey, you put me down
for the first case, okay?

1340
01:17:54,457 --> 01:17:59,796
Lightning! Lightning McQueen!

1341
01:18:00,797 --> 01:18:02,048
<i>Hey, Lightning!</i>

1342
01:18:02,632 --> 01:18:03,841
Hey, Mr. Sterling.

1343
01:18:04,509 --> 01:18:06,052
<i>To the future, eh, champ?</i>

1344
01:18:06,594 --> 01:18:08,638
Yeah. To the future.

1345
01:18:09,639 --> 01:18:12,892
<i>Hey, just focus on
what you're here to do, kid.</i>

1346
01:18:13,476 --> 01:18:14,685
Thanks, Smokey.

1347
01:18:14,852 --> 01:18:17,021
<i>Now, go make Hud proud.</i>

1348
01:18:17,188 --> 01:18:18,397
You got it.

1349
01:18:18,815 --> 01:18:20,483
<i>Boogity, boogity, boogity, let's go racing!</i>

1350
01:18:29,649 --> 01:18:32,986
<i>McQueen is making steady progress
in the early parts of this race.</i>

1351
01:18:33,486 --> 01:18:35,488
<i>Well, it won't be enough to catch Storm.</i>

1352
01:18:35,572 --> 01:18:36,656
<i>Considering he started dead last...</i>

1353
01:18:37,157 --> 01:18:38,992
<i>I don't think he's doing half-bad out there.</i>

1354
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:49,951
<i>Not too shabby!</i>

1355
01:18:50,076 --> 01:18:51,827
You keep this up,
you'll finish in the top 10!

1356
01:18:51,994 --> 01:18:53,746
Top 10's not gonna cut it, Smokey.

1357
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,248
I got to go all the way.

1358
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:58,000
So dig in! Remember your training.

1359
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,044
Find Storm and chase him down!

1360
01:19:00,211 --> 01:19:01,963
Oh, tell him he has three laps to catch me!

1361
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:04,507
Cruz says you've got three laps to catch her.

1362
01:19:04,674 --> 01:19:06,384
Yeah, okay! Tell her, thanks.

1363
01:19:13,008 --> 01:19:16,470
- Cruz, what are you doing here?
- Oh, Mr. Sterling, I was just...

1364
01:19:16,637 --> 01:19:18,097
I'd like you to head back
to the training center right away.

1365
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:19,723
Oh. But why?

1366
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:22,184
I need you to get Kurt up to speed
for the race next weekend.

1367
01:19:22,351 --> 01:19:24,853
Um... Wait, not Kurt.
He's the bug guy, right?

1368
01:19:24,937 --> 01:19:26,188
The other one... Ronald. Yes!

1369
01:19:26,472 --> 01:19:27,932
But I want to stay and watch.

1370
01:19:28,015 --> 01:19:29,725
That's not gonna happen, Cruz.

1371
01:19:29,934 --> 01:19:31,018
<i>Now go.</i>

1372
01:19:31,185 --> 01:19:33,145
But Mr. McQueen still has a chance...

1373
01:19:33,312 --> 01:19:34,647
Just go do your job!

1374
01:19:35,231 --> 01:19:36,357
Yes, sir.

1375
01:19:36,774 --> 01:19:38,818
And take off that spoiler
and those racing tires.

1376
01:19:38,901 --> 01:19:40,027
You look ridiculous!

1377
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:43,781
You are a trainer, remember? Not a racer!

1378
01:19:45,533 --> 01:19:49,245
If you were a racer, you'd know
what I'm talking about but you're not!

1379
01:19:49,328 --> 01:19:50,538
So you don't!

1380
01:19:54,667 --> 01:19:56,961
<i>No. She's not a racer. She's a trainer.</i>

1381
01:20:05,587 --> 01:20:08,090
<i>I've wanted to become a racer forever!</i>

1382
01:20:08,257 --> 01:20:09,633
<i>Because of you!</i>

1383
01:20:13,053 --> 01:20:16,640
It was my one shot and I didn't take it.

1384
01:20:16,807 --> 01:20:20,561
<i>It was my one shot and I didn't take it.</i>

1385
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:25,816
<i>Wreck in two. Wreck in turn two.</i>

1386
01:20:25,899 --> 01:20:26,984
<i>Go low. Go low.</i>

1387
01:20:41,165 --> 01:20:42,374
Kid, you okay?

1388
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:44,043
Smokey, I need Cruz!

1389
01:20:44,209 --> 01:20:45,210
<i>Never mind that now.</i>

1390
01:20:45,294 --> 01:20:46,587
No! I need her back here.

1391
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:48,088
Now!

1392
01:20:48,584 --> 01:20:50,169
<i>The yellow flag still out, folks.</i>

1393
01:20:50,336 --> 01:20:51,503
<i>Wrecked cars everywhere.
We're still trying to figure...</i>

1394
01:20:52,129 --> 01:20:54,757
<i>Hamilton here.
Call from Chester Whipplefilter.</i>

1395
01:20:54,924 --> 01:20:57,343
Chester... Mr. McQueen?

1396
01:20:57,676 --> 01:21:00,679
The green light's on, pit road is open,
and everybody's coming in.

1397
01:21:01,764 --> 01:21:05,059
Get ready, guys.
Luigi, Guido, tires! Fillmore, fuel!

1398
01:21:05,225 --> 01:21:07,019
Okay, I'm here. What's going on?

1399
01:21:08,062 --> 01:21:10,189
No! Not me! Her.

1400
01:21:10,272 --> 01:21:12,024
- Huh?
- What?

1401
01:21:12,191 --> 01:21:13,943
- What is she doing back here?
- Come on, guys! Get her set up!

1402
01:21:14,109 --> 01:21:16,445
- Okay! Hot tires!
- Wait! What's happening?

1403
01:21:16,695 --> 01:21:18,238
Hey, Ramone! You got your paints?

1404
01:21:18,447 --> 01:21:21,784
- You know I do!
- Guys! What are you doing?

1405
01:21:22,242 --> 01:21:24,787
Man, I don't understand it!
McQueen's just sitting there.

1406
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:25,996
Something's got to be wrong.

1407
01:21:26,246 --> 01:21:27,081
Mr. McQueen?

1408
01:21:27,289 --> 01:21:29,124
Today's the day, Cruz.
You're getting your shot.

1409
01:21:29,249 --> 01:21:29,917
What?

1410
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:32,544
I started this race
and you're gonna finish it.

1411
01:21:33,045 --> 01:21:36,840
What? She'll damage the brand!
She's just a trainer!

1412
01:21:37,049 --> 01:21:39,969
No, she's a racer.
Just took me awhile to see it.

1413
01:21:40,386 --> 01:21:41,303
That can't be legal!

1414
01:21:41,971 --> 01:21:43,639
The rules only say
the number has to be out there.

1415
01:21:43,806 --> 01:21:45,265
Doesn't say who has to wear it.

1416
01:21:45,474 --> 01:21:49,561
- No! You can't do that...
- Did I tell you I love your mudflaps?

1417
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:50,896
Out of my way, bumpkin!

1418
01:21:51,188 --> 01:21:53,273
Got my fishing flaps, got my church flaps,

1419
01:21:53,357 --> 01:21:55,025
my going out and eating flaps.

1420
01:21:57,236 --> 01:21:59,780
Come on, guys!
We got to get her out there! Let's go!

1421
01:21:59,947 --> 01:22:01,156
- Tires, check!
- Fuel, check!

1422
01:22:01,281 --> 01:22:01,949
Ramone?

1423
01:22:02,199 --> 01:22:04,785
Best I could do in the time frame, boss.

1424
01:22:05,285 --> 01:22:08,205
Yeah. That'll work.

1425
01:22:08,497 --> 01:22:09,873
Why are you doing this?

1426
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,710
You said it yourself,
this might be your last chance.

1427
01:22:12,876 --> 01:22:14,670
Which makes it my last chance

1428
01:22:14,753 --> 01:22:17,172
to give you your first chance, Cruz.

1429
01:22:18,173 --> 01:22:19,925
And this time I want you to take it.

1430
01:22:22,052 --> 01:22:24,096
She's got to beat that pace car out.

1431
01:22:25,806 --> 01:22:27,850
- No! You can't do that!
- Now or never.

1432
01:22:29,101 --> 01:22:30,102
What do you say?

1433
01:22:32,521 --> 01:22:34,982
Whoa! Hey! 35-mile-per-hour pit speed!

1434
01:22:35,524 --> 01:22:36,233
I knew that!

1435
01:22:44,074 --> 01:22:47,828
McQueen's team has entered
a different car sporting the 95.

1436
01:22:47,995 --> 01:22:49,204
I don't believe what I'm seeing!

1437
01:22:49,371 --> 01:22:50,664
You're watching this, right?

1438
01:22:50,914 --> 01:22:52,458
What, the girl in the costume?

1439
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:54,752
You're kidding me. He put her in the race?

1440
01:23:05,169 --> 01:23:07,629
The green flag is out
and we're back to racing.

1441
01:23:11,675 --> 01:23:13,594
Cruz? What are you doing?

1442
01:23:13,844 --> 01:23:15,888
<i>Come on. Pick it up! You got to go faster.</i>

1443
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:17,890
Call her Frances Beltline

1444
01:23:17,973 --> 01:23:20,768
and tell her the school bus
of death is after her.

1445
01:23:21,018 --> 01:23:22,770
- What? No.
- Trust me.

1446
01:23:23,687 --> 01:23:26,815
Uh, Frances Beltline,

1447
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:28,233
the school bus of death is after you.

1448
01:23:29,526 --> 01:23:32,362
What? Oh, uh... Right.

1449
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:34,990
Okay, that was different.

1450
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:38,535
Cruz, you're looking too tight now.

1451
01:23:38,702 --> 01:23:39,870
Come on. Loosen up.

1452
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,414
- Tell her she's a fluffy cloud.
- What? No.

1453
01:23:42,621 --> 01:23:43,455
Smokey, tell her.

1454
01:23:43,914 --> 01:23:49,003
Uh, Cruz, you are a fluffy cloud.

1455
01:23:49,545 --> 01:23:51,922
Oh, right. Uh, too tight.

1456
01:23:52,006 --> 01:23:54,550
I'm a fluffy cloud. I'm a fluffy cloud.

1457
01:23:57,094 --> 01:23:58,470
Uh...

1458
01:23:58,595 --> 01:24:00,431
<i>Anticipate your turns.</i>

1459
01:24:00,681 --> 01:24:01,640
Cruz! Get your head in the race.

1460
01:24:02,266 --> 01:24:06,812
Tell her she's on a beach and all
the little crabbies have gone night-night.

1461
01:24:08,355 --> 01:24:10,691
No! I ain't saying that. You tell her.

1462
01:24:12,693 --> 01:24:14,069
<i>All right, Cruz. The beach.</i>

1463
01:24:14,153 --> 01:24:15,529
<i>I need you to think of the beach.</i>

1464
01:24:15,696 --> 01:24:18,157
- Mr. McQueen?
- <i>Yeah. It's me. Remember the beach.</i>

1465
01:24:18,824 --> 01:24:21,035
Oh, pick a line, stick to it. Got it.

1466
01:24:24,371 --> 01:24:25,414
All right. Not too bad.

1467
01:24:25,873 --> 01:24:27,499
This is nothing like the simulator.

1468
01:24:28,083 --> 01:24:31,211
You got every tool you need.
Now remember Thomasville.

1469
01:24:31,295 --> 01:24:32,379
- <i>Thomasville?</i>
- Yeah.

1470
01:24:32,463 --> 01:24:33,505
Sneak through the window.

1471
01:24:33,797 --> 01:24:35,424
Now that I understand.

1472
01:24:35,674 --> 01:24:37,134
Sneak through the window.

1473
01:24:54,943 --> 01:24:56,987
<i>We're just learning that the racer</i>

1474
01:24:57,071 --> 01:24:59,490
replacing McQueen is Cruz Ramirez.

1475
01:24:59,573 --> 01:25:01,200
This is her very first race!

1476
01:25:01,283 --> 01:25:03,077
Actually, Darrell, it says here

1477
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,953
she does have one win under her belt.

1478
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,247
At a place called Thunder Hollow?

1479
01:25:07,748 --> 01:25:10,459
Thunder Hollow! She said Thunder Hollow!

1480
01:25:12,461 --> 01:25:14,630
Try moving half a lane. Half a lane.

1481
01:25:14,838 --> 01:25:16,548
- Got it.
- <i>All right, watch that lap car.</i>

1482
01:25:16,673 --> 01:25:20,719
<i>He's gonna go high. Go low! Go low! Nice job.</i>

1483
01:25:20,969 --> 01:25:22,429
You are smoking these guys.

1484
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:26,183
<i>Now watch the tire marbles along
turn three. Keep your tires clean.</i>

1485
01:25:26,266 --> 01:25:27,935
- Okay.
- Bump coming up on the inside.

1486
01:25:28,018 --> 01:25:29,395
Careful you don't go airborne.

1487
01:25:29,478 --> 01:25:30,729
- Now?
- <i>Yes. Now!</i>

1488
01:25:30,896 --> 01:25:34,066
<i>Watch out by the wall, it's a little
slick there. Watch it, watch it, watch it.</i>

1489
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:39,196
You have hit a wall. You have hit a wall.

1490
01:25:39,363 --> 01:25:41,657
Ha-ha. Just being aggressive.

1491
01:25:44,451 --> 01:25:48,080
<i>Okay, I want you to pit. Watch your RPM.</i>

1492
01:25:48,247 --> 01:25:50,666
Get out of the gas.
On the brake. On the brake.

1493
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:51,708
Too fast!

1494
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:52,960
Uh, we're back here.

1495
01:25:53,127 --> 01:25:53,961
Sorry.

1496
01:25:54,837 --> 01:25:57,423
All right.
Pick 'em off one at a time. Go, go, go!

1497
01:26:00,134 --> 01:26:02,094
<i>That's it. Nice and straight.</i>

1498
01:26:03,137 --> 01:26:04,221
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

1499
01:26:05,139 --> 01:26:07,683
Go, go, go, go! Smokey, you watching?

1500
01:26:12,855 --> 01:26:15,524
Just wanted to let you know
Ramirez is moving up toward you.

1501
01:26:15,691 --> 01:26:17,151
Why should I care?

1502
01:26:17,234 --> 01:26:18,986
<i>Because now she's in the top 10!</i>

1503
01:26:22,114 --> 01:26:24,741
Okay. Now you're coming up on the leaders.

1504
01:26:31,832 --> 01:26:35,252
- <i>Ramirez up to fourth.</i>
- In fourth? Huh.

1505
01:26:37,504 --> 01:26:39,173
Get 'er done!

1506
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:43,927
<i>Ramirez is in third.</i>

1507
01:26:51,685 --> 01:26:53,437
What are you doing, Storm?

1508
01:26:54,438 --> 01:26:56,982
Hey! Costume Girl.

1509
01:26:57,065 --> 01:26:58,400
You know, at first I thought
you were out here...

1510
01:26:58,484 --> 01:26:59,985
because your GPS was broken.

1511
01:27:00,068 --> 01:27:01,320
Don't listen to him, Cruz!

1512
01:27:01,403 --> 01:27:02,488
You look good!

1513
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:03,947
It's important to look the part.

1514
01:27:04,031 --> 01:27:07,034
You can't have everyone thinking
that you don't deserve to be here.

1515
01:27:07,117 --> 01:27:08,452
He's trying to get in your head!

1516
01:27:08,952 --> 01:27:10,954
They don't need to know
what you and I already do.

1517
01:27:11,705 --> 01:27:14,458
That you can play dress-up all you want,

1518
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:17,044
but you'll never be one of us.

1519
01:27:24,593 --> 01:27:26,220
Cruz, did you see what happened there?

1520
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:28,889
Yeah. He's in my head.

1521
01:27:29,139 --> 01:27:30,766
No! Listen to me.

1522
01:27:30,849 --> 01:27:33,769
You got into his head. Don't you understand?

1523
01:27:33,936 --> 01:27:37,564
He would never have done that
if you didn't scare him.

1524
01:27:37,648 --> 01:27:38,565
What?

1525
01:27:38,732 --> 01:27:41,610
<i>He sees something in you
that you don't even see in yourself.</i>

1526
01:27:42,277 --> 01:27:46,114
You made me believe it,
now you got to believe it too.

1527
01:27:47,533 --> 01:27:49,618
<i>You are a racer.</i>

1528
01:27:50,452 --> 01:27:51,745
Use that.

1529
01:28:02,256 --> 01:28:04,216
And how far back is she now?

1530
01:28:04,299 --> 01:28:06,510
- <i>Look behind you.</i>
- What?

1531
01:28:06,593 --> 01:28:08,428
- Good evening, Storm!
- Wait, how did you...

1532
01:28:08,512 --> 01:28:10,097
Just back here drafting on your butt.

1533
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:11,431
Nothing to be concerned about.

1534
01:28:11,723 --> 01:28:13,767
<i>Like two June bugs on a summer night.</i>

1535
01:28:17,271 --> 01:28:19,314
Hey, Hamilton.

1536
01:28:19,398 --> 01:28:21,358
- <i>Hamilton here.</i>
- Call out our speed.

1537
01:28:21,525 --> 01:28:24,611
<i>208 miles per hour, 207 miles...</i>

1538
01:28:24,695 --> 01:28:26,780
Would you stop that?
You're taking me off my line!

1539
01:28:26,989 --> 01:28:28,949
- Last lap!
- Come on, Cruz!

1540
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,073
Oh-oh!

1541
01:28:32,282 --> 01:28:35,535
My GPS is saying
I have slow traffic in my way.

1542
01:28:35,702 --> 01:28:38,538
- No, you are not winning this!
- Ah, you're angry.

1543
01:28:38,788 --> 01:28:40,498
I am not angry!

1544
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:43,126
You know, you can use that
anger to push through.

1545
01:28:43,376 --> 01:28:44,419
I said I'm not angry!

1546
01:28:45,712 --> 01:28:48,673
Oh, I don't think so! No!

1547
01:28:52,802 --> 01:28:53,928
Cruz, get out of there!

1548
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:56,765
You don't belong on this track!

1549
01:28:58,099 --> 01:29:00,393
Yes, I do!

1550
01:29:12,697 --> 01:29:15,742
<i>I don't believe it.
It's Cruz Ramirez for the win!</i>

1551
01:29:15,909 --> 01:29:17,202
<i>I am speechless!</i>

1552
01:29:19,035 --> 01:29:21,705
Nice finish, Cruz! You done it!

1553
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,957
Cruz Ramirez!

1554
01:29:24,207 --> 01:29:26,293
- Yeah, there you go!
- Way to go, Cruz!

1555
01:29:26,584 --> 01:29:28,003
Oh, yes!

1556
01:29:28,253 --> 01:29:29,754
Whoo-hoo!

1557
01:29:34,926 --> 01:29:36,803
Man, heck of a win!

1558
01:29:38,138 --> 01:29:41,099
Yeah. Heck of a win.

1559
01:29:45,219 --> 01:29:46,929
Hey, Cruz! You were flying!

1560
01:29:47,012 --> 01:29:48,097
Thanks.

1561
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:49,181
You really had it rolling today.

1562
01:29:49,265 --> 01:29:50,558
- That was cool.
- Thank you!

1563
01:29:50,641 --> 01:29:52,434
Hey, Cruz, your blinker's on.

1564
01:29:52,518 --> 01:29:57,314
It is? Oh! You got me! Very funny!

1565
01:30:04,071 --> 01:30:05,030
Cruz! Cruz! Cruz!

1566
01:30:05,114 --> 01:30:06,282
Ramirez!

1567
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:07,533
Whoo!

1568
01:30:07,616 --> 01:30:09,243
Way to go, Cruz!

1569
01:30:10,661 --> 01:30:12,830
Go ahead. Give them some smoke.

1570
01:30:13,455 --> 01:30:15,916
Cruz! Cruz! Cruz!

1571
01:30:27,169 --> 01:30:28,795
You'll get used to that.

1572
01:30:28,879 --> 01:30:31,089
Out of my way! Come on! Move it! Move!

1573
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:34,801
Cruz! I knew you had something.

1574
01:30:34,885 --> 01:30:37,179
And now look at you... a winner.

1575
01:30:37,929 --> 01:30:40,974
I could use you as a racer
on our team. We could make...

1576
01:30:41,474 --> 01:30:44,102
Sorry, Mr. Sterling.
I would never race for you.

1577
01:30:44,769 --> 01:30:45,812
I quit.

1578
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:47,981
Well, then race for me!

1579
01:30:48,148 --> 01:30:49,149
Tex!

1580
01:30:49,566 --> 01:30:51,234
Miss Cruz, I would be tickled pink

1581
01:30:51,318 --> 01:30:53,320
to have you race for team Dinoco.

1582
01:30:53,486 --> 01:30:56,198
As you know, we have a long
history of great racers,

1583
01:30:56,281 --> 01:30:57,657
except for Cal.

1584
01:30:57,824 --> 01:30:59,951
Uh, guys, I'm still right here.

1585
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,953
Team Dinoco, Cruz!

1586
01:31:02,162 --> 01:31:03,455
Hire her. I don't care.

1587
01:31:03,622 --> 01:31:05,332
Lightning, now that you're retired...

1588
01:31:05,498 --> 01:31:08,293
I need you first thing Monday
morning for a photo shoot.

1589
01:31:08,835 --> 01:31:10,295
Yeah, all right, Mr. Sterling.

1590
01:31:10,378 --> 01:31:12,339
Whoa! Hang on now.

1591
01:31:15,341 --> 01:31:17,802
What? Why is my name up there?

1592
01:31:18,094 --> 01:31:20,430
You started the race. That's how it works.

1593
01:31:20,638 --> 01:31:21,931
Wait, wait, now... Wait a minute. No!

1594
01:31:22,098 --> 01:31:24,434
Lightning wins, he decides
when he's done racing.

1595
01:31:24,517 --> 01:31:25,894
That was the deal.

1596
01:31:25,977 --> 01:31:27,353
Hi, I'm his lawyer.

1597
01:31:27,437 --> 01:31:28,855
That was the deal.

1598
01:31:28,938 --> 01:31:30,607
You are not a nice guy.

1599
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:34,694
Although, I got to say, you do make
a quality mudflap at an affordable price.

1600
01:31:34,777 --> 01:31:36,613
Hey, Sterling.

1601
01:31:36,696 --> 01:31:39,032
Why don't you and I take a drive and talk?

1602
01:31:39,115 --> 01:31:40,909
Billionaire to billionaire.

1603
01:31:41,075 --> 01:31:42,202
Cruz, over here.

1604
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:43,786
Just one picture. How does it
feel to beat Jackson Storm?

1605
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:45,038
Take us through it,

1606
01:31:45,121 --> 01:31:46,664
lap by lap.

1607
01:31:46,748 --> 01:31:49,626
It was great! Uh, didn't expect this.

1608
01:31:53,665 --> 01:31:56,292
Kid's got a lot of stuff, eh, Doc?

1609
01:31:58,544 --> 01:32:00,672
Well, she had a great teacher.

1610
01:32:02,256 --> 01:32:05,176
And now you get to decide
when you're done racing.

1611
01:32:05,802 --> 01:32:08,429
So what's it gonna be, Stinky? Uh, Stickers.

1612
01:32:10,723 --> 01:32:12,725
Oh, I'm gonna keep racing.

1613
01:32:12,809 --> 01:32:16,020
But before that,
I got something I want to do.

1614
01:32:23,236 --> 01:32:26,239
Welcome all to historic Willy's Butte

1615
01:32:26,322 --> 01:32:29,325
for today's great exhibition of speed!

1616
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:32,036
There she is! Cruz!

1617
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,621
Oh, I love it. I love it. I love it.

1618
01:32:33,746 --> 01:32:34,580
Thanks, guys!

1619
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:36,541
Nice paint, kiddo.

1620
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:38,167
Pardon me. Big hat, coming through.

1621
01:32:38,251 --> 01:32:41,212
Get 'er done, 51! Whoo-hoo!

1622
01:32:41,379 --> 01:32:43,923
Great number. Was McQueen's idea.

1623
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:46,009
He felt Hud would've wanted you to have it.

1624
01:32:46,509 --> 01:32:47,927
I love it.

1625
01:32:48,136 --> 01:32:50,221
Oh, it's perfect. It's very old-school.

1626
01:32:50,388 --> 01:32:52,640
Did someone just say old-school?

1627
01:32:53,683 --> 01:32:55,560
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

1628
01:32:55,727 --> 01:32:57,061
Oh, yeah! I like that.
It's bright, but I like it.

1629
01:33:00,648 --> 01:33:03,276
- Looking fabulous.
- <i>Favoloso.</i>

1630
01:33:03,443 --> 01:33:06,446
Trying something new. I like it.

1631
01:33:06,946 --> 01:33:08,906
Wow. Subtle.

1632
01:33:09,073 --> 01:33:12,785
Figured if I'm gonna be your crew chief,
I better do it in style.

1633
01:33:12,952 --> 01:33:14,912
What's Mr. Sterling gonna say?

1634
01:33:15,079 --> 01:33:18,416
I'm actually more worried about what Tex
is gonna say, considering he, uh...

1635
01:33:18,583 --> 01:33:21,544
bought Rust-eze. Thanks, Tex!

1636
01:33:21,961 --> 01:33:24,088
I made that Sterling fella

1637
01:33:24,172 --> 01:33:25,965
a Texas-sized offer!

1638
01:33:26,466 --> 01:33:28,259
So, you ready to start training?

1639
01:33:28,426 --> 01:33:30,344
I don't know. You ready to lose again?

1640
01:33:30,511 --> 01:33:32,847
Oh! Hope you've got your fluffy cloud.

1641
01:33:33,014 --> 01:33:34,265
I hope you got your drip pan.

1642
01:33:34,432 --> 01:33:37,018
Got my drip pan and I've taken my nap.

1643
01:33:37,101 --> 01:33:38,394
Bring it on, old man.

1644
01:33:38,478 --> 01:33:39,937
- Luigi.
- Go! Whoo-hoo!

1645
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:44,317
