00:00:28,284 --> 00:00:32,375
<i>I left Israel in 1980,
after three years in the army.</i>

3
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:35,844
<i>I was desperate to escape the well-worn path.</i>

4
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:40,583
<i>You know, high school, university,
work, marriage, kids...</i>

5
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:45,471
<i>...not me. I wanted to be different,
to experience the extraordinary...</i>

6
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:49,478
<i>...and to enter the unknown,
discover lost tribes...</i>

7
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,429
<i>...the hidden treasures,
the darkest heart of the jungle...</i>

8
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:56,732
<i>...which, of course,
is why I ended up in Bolivia...</i>

9
00:00:56,812 --> 00:00:58,663
<i>...South America.</i>

10
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:27,896
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome, may God be with you.

11
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:29,543
Cheers.

12
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:02,418
Wait, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, please!

13
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:06,156
- Wait, wait! Hey!
- Sir?

14
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,293
Wait, wait!

15
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:17,803
Thank you so much, sir.

16
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:24,393
- Thank you. Thank you so much, sir.
- Can I take that?

17
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:27,044
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Okay.

18
00:02:28,704 --> 00:02:32,401
Thank you. Thank you so much,
everyone. Thank you so much.

19
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:34,997
- I'm sorry about the bag.
- Oh, no problem.

20
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:38,157
- Okay, good. I'm Marcus Stamm.
- Yossi Ghinsberg.

21
00:02:38,237 --> 00:02:40,790
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

22
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,426
Yeah.

23
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:02,291
<i>You couldn't help but fall in love
with Marcus Stamm.</i>

24
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:04,728
<i>This Swiss school teacher on a sabbatical...</i>

25
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:08,296
<i>...had the heart of a poet
and the soul of a saint.</i>

26
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:10,488
<i>I'd never met anyone like him before.</i>

27
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:17,206
This is not bad!

28
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:22,712
I told my parents I'd be back in a year
but I don't think I'm ever going back.

29
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:27,783
Well, lucky you.

30
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:30,707
- Morning.
- Morning.

31
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:33,127
She likes you.

32
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,812
No. It can't be.

33
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:46,435
Kevin? Hey!

34
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:48,170
Hey, Kevin!

35
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,280
Oh, my God! Hey! My God! Come here!

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,443
What are you doing here?
Marcus! How are you, man?

37
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:56,279
Hey, I thought you went home after Patagonia!

38
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:00,326
No, I decided to trek up
the Cordilleras to get some more shots.

39
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,546
- Hey, this is my friend, Yossi Ghinsberg.
- Hey, man. Kevin Gale.

40
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,582
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you, too.

41
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,713
Come here, man!

42
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:12,541
- <i>I had already heard about Kevin Gale.</i>
- He taught me that...

43
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:14,987
<i>He was a legend amongst
the backpacking community...</i>

44
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:18,634
<i>...because he had hiked all over South
America, taking incredible photographs.</i>

45
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:21,764
- But, you know, that's why we're here...
- <i>I also knew...</i>

46
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,563
<i>...he was Marcus's closest friend.</i>

47
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:27,603
I've only been in South America
for a few months.

48
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:30,996
- Really? Where were you before that?
- The glamorous world...

49
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:34,683
- ...of fishing trawlers in Alaska.
- Yeah, that sounds great.

50
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:37,706
Freezing my ass off in New York,
unloading trucks.

51
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:39,976
- Really?
- But then went to Vegas...

52
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:43,577
- ...to make my fortune.
- What happened?

53
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:47,002
- I lost everything.
- Yeah.

54
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:51,380
Well, you found this guy,
and that is... priceless.

55
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,057
Okay.

56
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:56,004
Where'd you just come back in from?

57
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:59,942
Well, I went up to this place called Colca.
It's in southern Peru.

58
00:05:00,022 --> 00:05:02,212
I was taking shots of condors.

59
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:04,168
It's amazing.

60
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:27,534
- That's gross! Yeah.
- Bottoms up.

61
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:36,472
What is this stuff?

62
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,504
It's called San Pedro.

63
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:43,452
And how long does San Pedro
normally take to...

64
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:46,643
- ...kick in?
- You'll know.

65
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:55,953
Nothing's happening.

66
00:05:56,311 --> 00:05:58,989
Just wait. Trust me.

67
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:08,432
I actually feel kind of light-headed.

68
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:25,382
I think it's starting.

69
00:06:30,378 --> 00:06:32,256
<i>I'm flying.</i>

70
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,192
"With the long, lonely night ahead...

71
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:13,397
...and all the time in the world to decide
on the actions of a future life...

72
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:17,301
...he closed his eyes."

73
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,537
"It takes time to live."

74
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:24,404
"It takes time to live."

75
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:27,684
That's great.

76
00:07:28,604 --> 00:07:31,060
I think I should send this book to my father.

77
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:34,518
Doesn't he like you on the road?

78
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:39,676
It's not that he doesn't like it.
He just can't understand it.

79
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:42,971
And so he thinks...

80
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:45,142
...I'm throwing my life away.

81
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:51,936
I read a book once that said...

82
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:56,140
"The last human freedom...

83
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,609
...is to choose one's own way."

84
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:04,381
Yeah, that would be nice.

85
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:41,429
Sorry about him. He's American.

86
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:57,580
- This? Here?
- On the right, here.

87
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,905
- We're definitely gonna fit in, right?
- It'll be fine.

88
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:10,480
<i>Hola.</i>

89
00:09:28,055 --> 00:09:29,933
<i>Good morning.</i>

90
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:32,702
Are you American?

91
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,193
No.

92
00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:43,380
There's nothing like the jungle at night.

93
00:09:43,638 --> 00:09:46,995
It's the most alive sound. Insects, birds.

94
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:49,364
All these animals around you.

95
00:09:49,444 --> 00:09:53,657
It's like they're screaming at you,
pulsing like electricity.

96
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:58,741
And then suddenly... it stops.

97
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:01,231
There is nothing.

98
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,965
Just you and whatever you came looking for.

99
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:10,574
Between the mining and the missionaries,
there'll be nothing left.

100
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:14,760
In one generation, all of the Indians gone.

101
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,514
The last of the hidden world, gone.

102
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:19,316
Gone!

103
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,421
That's what you're dreaming of.
Right? The hidden world?

104
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:27,464
That's why you're here.

105
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,010
Yossi, I'm not trying to be an asshole.
I'm just saying.

106
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,804
Do you want to be like every other tourist?
You want to go to Machu Picchu?

107
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:41,049
Anybody can go to Machu Picchu.
But the jungle?

108
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:45,747
To see wild Indians that nobody has ever
seen before and this guy, Karl, who I met...

109
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:49,439
- ...who's very nice, he can take us there!
- How do you know he is telling the truth?

110
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,364
He pans for gold.
He's friends with the Indians.

111
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:53,869
He could be making all of this up,
like a spiel for him.

112
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:56,231
They know each other,
they're friends, they hang out.

113
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:58,455
Smiling with the Indians.
You met him in the street!

114
00:10:58,535 --> 00:11:00,829
He showed me photos.
You can take photos of this.

115
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:03,605
Him standing there, with the Indians, right?

116
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:06,309
He says the rivers there are filled with
gold and we come back with pockets full.

117
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,643
How can you even trust...
please watch that, it's burning, okay?

118
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:10,729
Yes. No, that is good.

119
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:14,069
- Magical. Thank you.
- There you go!

120
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:19,187
- It's nonsense, Yossi.
- Please... meet him!

121
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:23,028
- You just... you seem very sold on the idea.
- I'm doing it! I'm gonna do it.

122
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:25,828
You'll see I'm right.
Cancel your flights home.

123
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:28,530
- And come with me.
- Cancel our flight home?

124
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,027
That's great.
You're being stupid, Yossi, okay?

125
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:33,405
Kevin, tell him he's crazy.

126
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,639
I think Marcus is right.
It sounds like bullshit.

127
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,562
Just meet him.

128
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,351
This map's useless. It's what, one to 500?

129
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:51,086
It's a joke.

130
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,356
It's this and it's here. I'm your navigation.

131
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:57,025
The Toromonas Indians are here.

132
00:11:57,105 --> 00:12:00,903
"Río Colorado" Chico. We fly to Apolo, here.

133
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:04,389
We hike to Asariamas.

134
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:08,536
Then from here to Río Colorado, Chico...

135
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:12,309
- ...three, four days.
- I've never heard of these Toromonas.

136
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:14,330
Exactly.

137
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:17,866
- You're a photographer, right?
- Yeah.

138
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:22,806
There, you take photos, they get you
straight into National Geographic.

139
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:26,543
So, what do you say?

140
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:32,861
50 bucks a head to guide us.
That's it. To help and buy provisions.

141
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:35,297
And he says he'll pay us back
when we pan some gold.

142
00:12:35,377 --> 00:12:38,180
Yeah. The gold. Yeah. Whatever happened
to talking him out of it? Like we...

143
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,375
No, I know, I know. Look,
I have my doubts as well, but...

144
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:43,108
...Karl seems to know
what he's talking about.

145
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:46,518
And he's right. I'd get some amazing shots.
Like, once-in-a-lifetime shots.

146
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,257
Kevin wants to go. Marcus, come on.
You have to come with us.

147
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:51,434
It'll be an adventure.

148
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,520
- Yeah, okay, fine. I'll come.
- Yeah!

149
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,155
Yes!

150
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:05,561
We are going to have
the best time! This is "Yes"!

151
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,192
Who's going to the jungle?

152
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:12,300
- Come on. Is that enough?
- We'll get more food in Asariamas.

153
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,942
- Don't worry. No one starves in the jungle.
- What are these?

154
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:19,047
Speed. Zippo.
It makes you feel like Superman.

155
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:21,099
- Right.
- We need a better map.

156
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,325
I told you, there's no better map.

157
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:25,520
It's all unchartered. Look, nothing.

158
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,976
We just follow the river. In the jungle,
the rivers are your best friends. Okay?

159
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:32,892
You pay for this?

160
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:38,263
- We pay for this.
- Of course.

161
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,706
Right, no watches...

162
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,843
...and no wallets.

163
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:53,325
Karl says... "There's no time in ze jungle."

164
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:55,160
- No.
- "Can't get lost in ze jungle.

165
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,895
- Can't starve in ze jungle."
- "Invincible, ja?"

166
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:00,586
- "It's gonna be easy."
- Ja!

167
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:05,391
I'm gonna miss all this stuff.

168
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:07,839
What's that?

169
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,164
This my uncle gave to me before I left.

170
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:13,567
He said it will protect me.

171
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,281
You believe that?

172
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:18,196
- Kevin.
- What?

173
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:20,373
I... I don't know.

174
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:24,589
I don't know,
but he carried it all his life...

175
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:28,147
...and he survived the war and the camps.

176
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:34,554
And then two days after
he gave it to me, he died.

177
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,643
Yeah, I think we have room for it.

178
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:31,745
This is the last frontier on Earth.

179
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:35,815
Still alive, still wild.

180
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,459
Not for long. We don't like wild.

181
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:44,002
We don't like untamed.
We're obsessed with control.

182
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:45,670
So...

183
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,772
...we ruin the whole planet...

184
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:51,343
...and pride ourselves for creating
stupid national parks...

185
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:55,200
...with stupid rangers in stupid hats...

186
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:57,815
...to protect what's already gone.

187
00:15:58,695 --> 00:16:02,921
Why? 'Cause we're scared.
The jungle shows us what we really are.

188
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:05,644
We're nothing. We're a joke.

189
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:08,347
God fucked up.

190
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:16,823
These tribal cultures...

191
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:20,777
...it seems like they live
in Stone Age but in reality...

192
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:23,601
...they are far ahead of us.

193
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:27,133
Invisible. Hidden in the Madidi.

194
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:31,916
The Toromonas, they understand
that they are part...

195
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:34,240
...of a much bigger picture.

196
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,886
They don't want what we have. They're smart.

197
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,647
They're truly free.

198
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,737
Shit! Shit! Get it off me! Shit.

199
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,085
- What is it?
- Something hit me!

200
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:09,992
- What? What?
- I don't know! Like a bat or something.

201
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,271
Something hit me in the face,
like a bat or something.

202
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:17,016
- I thought I was being attacked.
- Yes, you were. By a killer moth.

203
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,826
This place is getting pretty dangerous, man.
I think we should turn back.

204
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:26,261
- Boys, go to bed.
- You're okay, though? You're alright?

205
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:28,574
I might keep watch for a bit.

206
00:17:29,854 --> 00:17:34,062
Watch out. Watch out! There's killer leaves!
They're back again! It's getting you too.

207
00:17:34,142 --> 00:17:36,618
Get them out of my face or you're
gonna get a killer stick up your ass!

208
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:39,351
Keep moving, guys. It's gonna rain soon.

209
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:42,941
Rain? There's not a cloud in the sky.

210
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:47,739
I thought you said the rainy season
didn't start for two weeks!

211
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:51,084
In rainy season, this is a light shower!

212
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,087
How did you know it was gonna rain?

213
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:58,536
- I know everything.
- I bet you can talk to the animals too, yeah?

214
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:00,827
To monkeys I can.

215
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,527
Sure.

216
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:05,767
Watch it! Not too close.

217
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:09,468
The threads will burn.
And the whole thing falls apart.

218
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:14,442
Don't worry. Tomorrow,
we'll find some real food.

219
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:16,610
It's right there.

220
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:19,454
It's waiting for us.

221
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:24,300
That'll be good, Papa. 'Cause you have to
provide for your hungry children, you know?

222
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:56,149
- Do you see Karl?
- He's just gone on ahead. It's okay.

223
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:02,868
- Jesus, Marcus!
- Yossi, let me look at that.

224
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:07,406
- I have something in my bag...
- No, Marcus, stop! Keep walking.

225
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:10,508
- Okay.
- Come on, go!

226
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,799
We need more than one machete.

227
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,405
Shit!

228
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:22,714
Karl!

229
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,556
Guys...

230
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:26,584
Kevin, what if he didn't go that way?
What if he...

231
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:29,994
- No, he said Asariamas is on the river.
- No! No. We're going to wait.

232
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:32,920
Marcus, pick up your shit.
He's not coming back. Let's go.

233
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,267
I'm not getting lost just because
you don't want to wait.

234
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:38,536
- Marcus, we're not lost. We're on a trail.
- You don't know. Karl?

235
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:40,205
- The river is just down there!
- Karl?

236
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,840
- Marcus, Asariamas is on the river.
- Karl?

237
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,931
- Marcus... stop!
- Karl!

238
00:19:48,393 --> 00:19:50,615
- Why are you here, man?
- What?

239
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:54,529
I mean, seriously, you're not enjoying
any of this. Why did you come here?

240
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:57,672
- Hey! I'm enjoying myself, okay?
- Wait. Quiet.

241
00:19:57,752 --> 00:20:02,332
- Quiet? Kevin, what are you talking about?
- Quiet! Be quiet! Quiet!

242
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:06,803
What is that?

243
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:15,461
Guys? Kevin, please, let's take
our backpacks off and go. Okay?

244
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:24,503
What is that?

245
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:37,483
- Asariamas?
- Asariamas.

246
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:49,262
Okay.

247
00:20:52,857 --> 00:20:56,781
Hey. Next time you're gonna wander
off without us, let us know, okay?

248
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:59,917
- We thought we were lost.
- I'm sorry.

249
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:02,920
I didn't know I was supposed to
hold your hand the whole time.

250
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,928
I thought you wanted an adventure.

251
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:09,022
<i>Hola!</i>

252
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:25,899
Asariamas.

253
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:46,318
I'm sorry about before.

254
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:49,123
- No, man, I'm sorry too.
- Pass it here.

255
00:21:49,203 --> 00:21:52,537
Hey... hey, guys? It looks like
we're the main show in town.

256
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:54,194
What?

257
00:21:58,122 --> 00:21:59,859
Hello, everyone.

258
00:22:00,758 --> 00:22:02,959
That old lady's staring at my junk.

259
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:12,781
Yeah.

260
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:20,298
It's like if you mixed puke and shit...

261
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:22,866
...it would taste better than this.

262
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,235
Well.

263
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:26,675
They were stolen.

264
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:34,190
- Let me help you there.
- Okay.

265
00:22:50,442 --> 00:22:52,664
Yeah, of course, please.

266
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:55,700
You are so brave! You are so brave!

267
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,423
How old are you?

268
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:16,575
Okay. Let's go!

269
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:35,594
Hey! I found gold!

270
00:23:39,022 --> 00:23:41,851
- Back off!
- Cut it out!

271
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:51,678
Keep your arms out.

272
00:23:52,136 --> 00:23:53,812
Still.

273
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:56,700
Amazing.

274
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:06,525
Look at the world.

275
00:24:07,384 --> 00:24:09,273
Perfectly balanced.

276
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:12,198
The problem is us. People.

277
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:16,952
We're the cancer.
We deserve to disappear, seriously.

278
00:24:18,362 --> 00:24:21,793
Communism isn't the answer.
Neither is revolution. I tried both.

279
00:24:21,873 --> 00:24:24,967
The solution is automation.

280
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:28,092
Mathematical Cosmo politics.

281
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:30,662
Put a freaking computer in charge.

282
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:35,354
No ego trips, no pride.
A computer program for the common good.

283
00:24:36,814 --> 00:24:40,226
By the way, I got in trouble for saying that.

284
00:24:41,418 --> 00:24:43,475
I made myself pretty clear.

285
00:24:43,555 --> 00:24:45,397
They're still looking for me.

286
00:24:59,604 --> 00:25:01,260
Monkeys.

287
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:24,944
Karl! Just shoot it! Just shoot it!

288
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:35,409
In the jungle... never waste a bullet?

289
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:37,534
It's gonna be the best meat you ever tasted.

290
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:45,084
What?

291
00:25:45,617 --> 00:25:47,861
Eat, you pussies.

292
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:24,213
I'll be damned. It's good. It's really good.

293
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,933
Marcus.

294
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,421
It's just meat. It's good.

295
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,643
Okay.

296
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:48,787
- Marcus, it really is okay.
- But I just... I can't. I mean, it...

297
00:26:50,214 --> 00:26:52,725
What did you think
you were gonna eat out here?

298
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,764
I'll cook him some rice.

299
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,312
Better keep the fire going tonight.

300
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:04,457
If there are monkeys, there are also jaguars.

301
00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:07,251
They are monkey hunters...

302
00:27:07,331 --> 00:27:09,208
...and for them...

303
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,668
...we are just big, stupid monkeys.

304
00:27:13,636 --> 00:27:15,410
Okay.

305
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:02,235
Just for insurances...

306
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:06,377
- Yeah.
- Keep them dry, just keep them dry.

307
00:28:06,457 --> 00:28:09,867
Every time we stop, take your
shoes off and spread your toes.

308
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:11,837
Hey, Marcus?

309
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,940
I'll carry some of your load tomorrow, okay?

310
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:16,859
Yeah, me too.

311
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:19,344
Thank you, guys.

312
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:49,887
You know, when the storms build up...

313
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:53,390
Karl said we have to make it out
before the rainy season...

314
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,532
...but we're never gonna do it
if we're going this slow.

315
00:28:55,612 --> 00:28:57,717
It's Marcus.

316
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:00,529
He's acting like a... a girl scout.

317
00:29:01,145 --> 00:29:03,155
Come on, it's his feet.

318
00:29:03,314 --> 00:29:06,992
You and me are handling it, right?
But look at him.

319
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,963
Clinging on to his papa.

320
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,423
I guess I'll turn in.

321
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:49,468
- Yeah, I'm pretty tired too.
- Yossi! No, please... I...

322
00:29:50,661 --> 00:29:54,545
I am sorry that I can't keep up.
You know this is not my fault.

323
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,209
My feet are not my fault!

324
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:01,146
You know, it's like... because of this...

325
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,947
...we are not friends anymore?

326
00:30:05,742 --> 00:30:08,153
Nothing's changed.

327
00:30:13,484 --> 00:30:15,494
Get some rest, okay?

328
00:30:57,194 --> 00:31:00,952
So, we stay here until Marcus
can walk and... back to Asariamas.

329
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:02,719
- From here?
- Yeah.

330
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,458
- We're what, 3, 4 days from the Chico?
- Yes, but Marcus can't walk four days.

331
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:09,548
It's fine, we carry him.

332
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:12,129
That's fantastic, genius.

333
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,648
We'll watch you. It's impossible. We can't.

334
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:17,605
No, what we can't do is give up!

335
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:23,074
All right. So, you guys stay here.
I go and find the Toromonas...

336
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:25,609
...come back with them,
take you to their village.

337
00:31:25,689 --> 00:31:28,967
No. You're not going anywhere.
We're not staying here without you.

338
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:33,450
Then we stay here until Marcus
can walk, and go back to Asariamas.

339
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,977
No! No, no, no. We are not going back.
We're not... not going back.

340
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:43,864
Come on, guys. We've come this far.
There's no way we can stop now.

341
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:49,758
- Okay. What's going on?
- Okay, so, we'll...

342
00:31:49,838 --> 00:31:51,690
Karl wants to go back.

343
00:31:54,118 --> 00:31:57,221
Wait. There's another way to do this.

344
00:31:57,301 --> 00:31:59,388
Hey, can we build a raft here?

345
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:06,383
- What, and head downriver from here?
- Yeah. Look, if we build one here...

346
00:32:06,463 --> 00:32:10,021
...we can take it down past
Curiplaya to Rurrenabaque...

347
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:12,957
...and from there, we can just fly to La Paz.

348
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:15,359
We'll still see the jungle,
maybe even the Toromonas.

349
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:18,355
Yeah, look, it's easy
with the finger on the map.

350
00:32:18,435 --> 00:32:21,720
- This river is not easy.
- Is it runnable?

351
00:32:23,327 --> 00:32:25,423
Is it runnable?

352
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:30,867
- I guess.
- Well, then, it's doable.

353
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:33,166
You want to at least give it a try?

354
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,970
I'm in. Marcus?

355
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,985
Yeah, okay.

356
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:45,678
Great. Three against one. We go on the river!

357
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:14,840
Fuck! What the hell is that?

358
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,553
It's a fire ant.

359
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:19,923
The first missionaries took Indians
who wouldn't believe in baby Jesus...

360
00:33:20,003 --> 00:33:24,421
...they tied them on trees
and covered them with fire ants.

361
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:27,030
After that, let me tell you, they believed.

362
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,460
Yeah.

363
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,442
- Have some water.
- Do you have enough?

364
00:33:38,522 --> 00:33:41,060
Yeah, yeah. We share, okay?

365
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,735
- Thanks, man.
- That's okay.

366
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:50,642
Guys, look.

367
00:33:51,168 --> 00:33:53,992
What one man can't do with one knife, no?

368
00:34:00,177 --> 00:34:05,102
We must work as a team, okay?
If there is calm water, we use the paddles.

369
00:34:05,182 --> 00:34:08,786
When there are rapids, the poles only, okay?

370
00:34:09,386 --> 00:34:13,444
You stay on the front, you in the back.
You must listen to everything I say, okay?

371
00:34:13,524 --> 00:34:14,986
Yeah.

372
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:16,613
Okay?

373
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:18,020
You're the captain.

374
00:34:19,296 --> 00:34:21,139
Okay. Let's go.

375
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:00,113
You okay?

376
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:15,583
Okay, guys, this is it.

377
00:35:18,189 --> 00:35:21,867
- What about the rocks over there?
- It's okay, just follow the river.

378
00:35:22,693 --> 00:35:25,137
- Stay in the middle, okay?
- Okay.

379
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:29,808
Okay, Karl?

380
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:31,877
Karl?

381
00:35:32,303 --> 00:35:35,380
Left. Go left! To the left!

382
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:43,334
- Hang on!
- Let's go with it!

383
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:47,003
- Okay. Okay.
- To the right! To the right!

384
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,972
- Which way do we go?
- Go to the right!

385
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:51,679
- Karl! Karl! Listen to me. Calm down.
- Oh, my God!

386
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:54,205
- Follow the river!
- Okay!

387
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,780
Take the pole! The pole!

388
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,716
Fucking get off the pole! Follow the river!

389
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:01,874
Yossi, the rock!

390
00:36:02,466 --> 00:36:05,478
- I see it!
- Be careful, be careful, Yossi, okay?

391
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,359
Okay, guys! Come on! Just let it go!

392
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:10,844
- The pole's gone!
- You don't know what you're doing!

393
00:36:10,924 --> 00:36:12,829
- To the right!
- Karl!

394
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:17,121
Shit!

395
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:21,337
- No, listen!
- Give us one instruction!

396
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:24,175
- Go left! Go left!
- Oh, my God!

397
00:36:24,255 --> 00:36:26,042
- Go left!
- To the right!

398
00:36:26,122 --> 00:36:28,444
Follow the river!

399
00:36:28,524 --> 00:36:31,247
- Just shut the fuck up and paddle.
- Just listen to me...

400
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:33,016
- Hey!
- Come on! Hey!

401
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:36,420
- You're gonna get us all killed!
- We're in the middle of a river.

402
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,974
- Okay.
- We gotta go over there!

403
00:36:41,104 --> 00:36:43,292
Kevin, Yossi, please pick up
your paddles. Listen to Karl.

404
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:46,401
Shut up! Shut up!

405
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:49,828
- Go to the right bank! That's it!
- Okay.

406
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:51,757
Paddle!

407
00:36:52,115 --> 00:36:54,160
Yossi, pick up your paddle.

408
00:36:57,654 --> 00:36:59,197
Shit!

409
00:37:04,027 --> 00:37:05,974
So now you're giving orders?
You can't just listen to Karl?

410
00:37:06,054 --> 00:37:08,073
Shut the fuck up!

411
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:17,526
This is not Oregon... dude! Don't you get it?

412
00:37:17,606 --> 00:37:19,985
- You have no idea what you...
- Shut up!

413
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:23,521
Karl... tell us the plan.

414
00:37:24,114 --> 00:37:27,159
The plan? I'll tell you the plan.

415
00:37:27,884 --> 00:37:29,373
We camp here.

416
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:33,180
Tomorrow, we schlep the raft along
the river until we pass those rapids.

417
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,098
I go hunting now. And Captain America
here can go and fuck himself.

418
00:37:38,178 --> 00:37:39,783
Great work, Kevin. Congratulations.

419
00:37:39,863 --> 00:37:42,353
The only guy who knows where we are
and what we're going to do...

420
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:45,021
- ...and he just walked away.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

421
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:48,546
You're such a fucking let-down,
I can't even believe it.

422
00:38:07,558 --> 00:38:09,505
Did you see Karl on the raft?

423
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:16,274
He was terrified.

424
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,645
He had no idea what he was doing.
He can't even read the river.

425
00:38:22,072 --> 00:38:24,149
You know what I think?

426
00:38:27,978 --> 00:38:30,022
Karl can't swim.

427
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:36,161
Holy shit.

428
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,389
You have to go and look for him, Kevin.
You upset him. It's not fair.

429
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:44,136
- Papa looks after us.
- Oh, enough with the Papa shit, Marcus.

430
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:46,839
Jesus.

431
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:50,908
I'll go.

432
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,758
Karl?

433
00:39:08,118 --> 00:39:09,661
Karl?

434
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:45,709
Karl? What are you doing?

435
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:48,144
- You didn't see it?
- See what?

436
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,880
Jaguar.

437
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,003
Scared it off.

438
00:39:52,596 --> 00:39:54,940
Probably thought you were a stupid ape.

439
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,101
What, Karl?

440
00:40:20,623 --> 00:40:22,234
Come on. Let's go.

441
00:40:23,393 --> 00:40:25,403
Go ahead. Good luck.

442
00:40:26,863 --> 00:40:29,052
I'm walking out from here.

443
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:31,243
No more river for me.

444
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:35,562
Is this... is this about the rapids?
What do you want me to say, sorry?

445
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:39,295
Don't be silly. You're the captain now.

446
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,866
I'm hiking to Ipurama. It's three days.

447
00:40:42,946 --> 00:40:46,570
You can come with me or you can
be fish food, I don't give a shit.

448
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,626
Do whatever the fuck you want.

449
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:51,463
For now...

450
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:54,532
...I go and take a nice dump...

451
00:40:54,825 --> 00:40:57,719
...in the world's biggest <i>baño</i>.

452
00:40:57,994 --> 00:41:00,639
And you decide what you want to do, boss.

453
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:06,178
One against three.

454
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:24,237
Shit.

455
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:26,943
I've been on rivers my whole life...

456
00:41:27,023 --> 00:41:28,779
...and I don't have a death wish.

457
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,782
But I am telling you, we can do this river.

458
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:33,939
I want to carry on too, but...

459
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,944
...what about Marcus?

460
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:41,714
He's going to want to come with us.

461
00:41:43,356 --> 00:41:45,487
He'll be safer with Karl.

462
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:48,786
It's tough.

463
00:41:49,613 --> 00:41:52,135
But it's wrong for him to come with us.

464
00:41:52,215 --> 00:41:54,442
It's wrong for us to take him.

465
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:57,162
I'm not taking him.

466
00:41:58,021 --> 00:42:00,410
He's starting to lose it.

467
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,300
He's gotta get out.

468
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,403
You okay with that?

469
00:42:06,997 --> 00:42:08,873
I don't know.

470
00:42:13,203 --> 00:42:15,013
I'm going to talk to him.

471
00:42:30,353 --> 00:42:31,863
Hey.

472
00:42:32,689 --> 00:42:34,786
What's the matter?

473
00:42:37,627 --> 00:42:39,783
I've been talking to Kevin...

474
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:42,474
...and he's going to continue on the river.

475
00:42:43,433 --> 00:42:45,243
Without Karl?

476
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:49,739
You know, I love Kevin but he's crazy.
That is insane.

477
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:52,863
- He can't go alone. That's going to be...
- I know, Marcus, I know. I...

478
00:42:52,943 --> 00:42:54,619
...tried to change his mind.

479
00:42:56,246 --> 00:42:58,669
Look, if he goes on his own,
he's never gonna make it, right?

480
00:42:58,749 --> 00:43:02,160
So one of us has to go with him. And...

481
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,366
Marcus, your feet are bad.
You can't get back on the raft, right?

482
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:11,783
My feet are fine.

483
00:43:12,763 --> 00:43:15,372
- Really?
- Yeah.

484
00:43:17,033 --> 00:43:20,712
I've been bathing them every day
since we started building the raft, you know?

485
00:43:21,805 --> 00:43:23,615
Okay, well, that's...

486
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,618
...that's good news, actually, for...

487
00:43:27,644 --> 00:43:30,122
...for me. To be honest, I'd...

488
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,677
...I would rather go out with Karl,
just to get out in three days...

489
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:36,761
...be done with it all.

490
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:39,943
So, if that's okay with you, maybe...

491
00:43:40,023 --> 00:43:42,067
...just you and Kevin go on the raft.

492
00:43:46,562 --> 00:43:48,573
No, I am sorry.

493
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:51,776
But I can't go out with him alone.

494
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:56,381
I mean, you see how he is with me.

495
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:01,765
My feet, they slowed down
the whole trip, and I'm so sorry.

496
00:44:01,845 --> 00:44:04,522
It's fine, I understand.

497
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:08,772
If it's okay with you, I would...

498
00:44:08,852 --> 00:44:11,096
...I would really like to go with Karl.

499
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:17,080
So you're okay,
with your feet being how they are?

500
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,403
- Yeah.
- I...

501
00:44:20,563 --> 00:44:22,139
Okay.

502
00:44:23,366 --> 00:44:25,095
Really?

503
00:44:25,175 --> 00:44:26,840
Yeah.

504
00:44:35,245 --> 00:44:37,054
Thank you, Yossi.

505
00:44:49,592 --> 00:44:51,598
Okay, we are here.

506
00:44:51,678 --> 00:44:54,364
There are rapids everywhere.
Here, here, here.

507
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:58,128
This is the worst.
You'll be there probably by tomorrow.

508
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:01,579
- Mal Paso San Pedro.
- Can we make it through there?

509
00:45:01,694 --> 00:45:04,506
Don't even try. There are cliffs
on both sides. No shore, no nothing.

510
00:45:04,586 --> 00:45:06,818
Once you're in, you're dead.

511
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:09,955
And how are we gonna know when to stop?

512
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:14,424
There's a beach on the right side.
You have to stop there.

513
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:19,139
If you can't, jump and swim for it.
Do not go into the canyon.

514
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,672
Okay.

515
00:45:24,147 --> 00:45:25,815
- You take the machete.
- Yeah.

516
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:28,324
- I keep the shotgun.
- Yeah. That's fine.

517
00:45:28,404 --> 00:45:32,022
- And food, we split 50-50.
- No, no. You need more.

518
00:45:32,102 --> 00:45:35,698
We'll be out in three days.
We reach Ipurama...

519
00:45:35,778 --> 00:45:39,984
...get donkeys and food.
We ride back to Apolo like kings.

520
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,653
Right?

521
00:46:09,472 --> 00:46:11,183
You're so full of shit.

522
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:14,919
Sure, Karl.

523
00:46:21,084 --> 00:46:22,928
Man of action.

524
00:46:32,595 --> 00:46:34,606
We'll be waiting for you.

525
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:45,817
Lake Titicaca.

526
00:46:46,242 --> 00:46:49,244
If that captain hadn't turned back,
we would never have met.

527
00:46:52,148 --> 00:46:53,837
Okay, so...

528
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,505
- ...good luck, Kevin.
- Yeah, you too.

529
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:57,661
And be safe.

530
00:46:57,988 --> 00:46:59,531
Yeah.

531
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:01,966
Hey.

532
00:47:02,392 --> 00:47:06,299
- At the hostel, we make a big meal?
- Yeah, sounds great.

533
00:47:06,379 --> 00:47:08,280
Yeah? All we can eat?

534
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:13,245
Yep. And I promise, back in La Paz,
everything will be like it was before.

535
00:47:14,424 --> 00:47:17,515
Yeah. Yeah.

536
00:47:47,503 --> 00:47:50,031
- Ready?
- Ready.

537
00:47:56,178 --> 00:47:57,822
Oar, please.

538
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:58,294
Hey, do you know what day it is?

539
00:48:58,374 --> 00:49:02,219
December... 1st, maybe. I think.

540
00:49:04,314 --> 00:49:06,591
Maybe I can make it home for Christmas.

541
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:32,617
Can we stop for the night soon
and try to catch a fish?

542
00:49:33,776 --> 00:49:36,188
There's still an hour of daylight left.

543
00:49:38,114 --> 00:49:40,536
I think we try to get closer to the canyon.

544
00:49:40,616 --> 00:49:42,459
What do you think?

545
00:50:09,112 --> 00:50:11,322
Oh, shit!

546
00:50:11,614 --> 00:50:12,722
Kevin?

547
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:16,260
Get your paddle. Get your paddle! Come on!

548
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:18,129
Quick!

549
00:50:20,486 --> 00:50:23,079
Get your paddle! Paddle, Yossi!

550
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:25,708
- I am!
- Come on!

551
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:28,788
- Paddle!
- Jeez, this is too strong!

552
00:50:28,868 --> 00:50:31,664
- Kevin, what do we do?
- There's the beach! There's the beach, go!

553
00:50:31,744 --> 00:50:33,623
Okay, hard! Hard!

554
00:50:34,203 --> 00:50:35,958
Fuck, we're drifting!

555
00:50:36,038 --> 00:50:39,996
- Come on, paddle! Push!
- We're never gonna make it!

556
00:50:40,076 --> 00:50:42,584
- Push!
- I'm pushing! It's too strong!

557
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,573
- Come on, Yossi!
- Kevin!

558
00:50:53,323 --> 00:50:55,311
It's okay!

559
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,869
Right, right, right!

560
00:50:58,728 --> 00:51:00,938
Come on! We're gonna do this!

561
00:51:02,164 --> 00:51:03,975
Oh, fuck!

562
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:09,246
- Rock! Kevin!
- Get down! Get down! Go!

563
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:22,274
Hold tight, Yossi!

564
00:51:22,763 --> 00:51:24,340
Oh, Jesus!

565
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,346
- Kevin! Kevin!
- It's okay! Hold on, Yossi!

566
00:51:32,995 --> 00:51:35,439
- Kevin!
- Hold tight!

567
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,273
Oh, no... No!

568
00:51:40,353 --> 00:51:43,926
- Okay! Okay! I'm going across!
- What?

569
00:51:44,006 --> 00:51:47,079
- I'm going over! We can't stay here.
- No! Kevin, you can't leave me!

570
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:51,174
Listen to me, listen to me! When I get
to the bank, throw me the machete!

571
00:51:51,254 --> 00:51:53,269
I'm gonna cut some vine
and pull you out, okay?

572
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:55,605
- No! It's too dangerous!
- It's the only way.

573
00:51:55,685 --> 00:51:58,794
- Kevin, please! You'll never make it!
- It's the only way!

574
00:51:58,874 --> 00:52:02,260
I'm gonna make it, okay?
I'm gonna make it. I'm not leaving you.

575
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,127
I'm not leaving you, okay? Just hold on!

576
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,931
No! Kevin!

577
00:52:24,847 --> 00:52:26,404
Yes!

578
00:52:28,584 --> 00:52:30,443
Yossi, hold on!

579
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:32,497
Hurry! Hurry!

580
00:52:33,223 --> 00:52:36,031
Here, Kevin, the raft's moving!

581
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:40,938
- Kevin!
- Yossi! Yossi, the machete!

582
00:52:49,104 --> 00:52:50,929
Yossi!

583
00:56:39,301 --> 00:56:40,845
Kevin!

584
00:56:42,505 --> 00:56:44,415
Kevin!

585
00:57:52,071 --> 00:57:53,917
Holy shit.

586
00:58:00,149 --> 00:58:01,658
No.

587
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,553
Superman.

588
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:19,070
Kevin!

589
00:59:26,702 --> 00:59:28,229
Kevin?

590
00:59:31,273 --> 00:59:32,277
Kevin!

591
00:59:35,695 --> 00:59:36,738
Kevin!

592
00:59:46,922 --> 00:59:48,765
Kevin!

593
00:59:54,296 --> 00:59:55,872
Kevin?

594
01:02:34,857 --> 01:02:36,427
Shit.

595
01:02:45,334 --> 01:02:47,341
I'm a man of action.

596
01:03:09,591 --> 01:03:11,234
Come on!

597
01:04:13,422 --> 01:04:16,935
<i># Pretend you're happy when you're blue #</i>

598
01:04:19,794 --> 01:04:24,628

Great. It moves.

Hey.

609
01:05:53,688 --> 01:05:55,265
Yossi?

Kevin?

Kevin?

01:06:05,967 --> 01:06:07,578
Yossi.

614
01:06:07,936 --> 01:06:10,981
Marcus? What?

615
01:06:13,975 --> 01:06:15,386
Yossi.

616
01:06:16,445 --> 01:06:18,021
Marcus!

01:07:41,761 --> 01:07:44,606
Come on. Come on.

618
01:10:22,123 --> 01:10:23,666
Hello?

619
01:10:24,793 --> 01:10:27,437
Hello! Hello!

01:10:27,996 --> 01:10:29,506
<i>Hola!</i>

No.

626
01:12:45,566 --> 01:12:49,290
So... this must be Curiplaya.

627
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:51,114
So, then...

628
01:12:51,473 --> 01:12:53,549
...I have to get to...

629
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:56,049
...Rurrenabaque.

01:13:00,549 --> 01:13:02,058
No.

632
01:13:02,617 --> 01:13:07,778
It's not a long way
for the luckiest man on Earth.

633
01:13:08,089 --> 01:13:10,729
It's just... there.

634
01:13:10,809 --> 01:13:13,366
You can walk there on these feet.

635
01:13:17,165 --> 01:13:21,923
Okay. Okay, Yossi. You need to do this.

636
01:13:22,003 --> 01:13:24,025
You have to get them dry.

637
01:13:24,105 --> 01:13:25,916
Come on.

638
01:13:57,939 --> 01:14:01,429
I'm so sorry, Marcus. I didn't know.

639
01:14:01,509 --> 01:14:04,240
I just didn't want to be the weakest.

640
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:07,961
I was more scared than you...

641
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:10,326
...because I'm a coward.

642
01:14:11,519 --> 01:14:14,973
Because I am a coward and I deserve...

643
01:14:15,053 --> 01:14:16,877
...all of this.

644
01:15:13,281 --> 01:15:14,857
Kevin!

645
01:15:16,384 --> 01:15:19,061
Kevin! I'm here!

646
01:15:19,604 --> 01:15:21,147
Kevin!

647
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:23,866
Kevin!

648
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:44,854
No! No!

649
01:15:46,114 --> 01:15:48,349
No! No!

650
01:15:48,429 --> 01:15:50,294
You. No!

651
01:15:53,487 --> 01:15:55,114
Stupid idiot!

652
01:15:58,192 --> 01:16:00,120
University.

653
01:16:01,329 --> 01:16:02,581
Law school.

654
01:16:02,661 --> 01:16:05,529
Papa, I know. I know
how you feel and I'm sorry.

655
01:16:05,609 --> 01:16:07,560
Not one shekel!

656
01:16:09,804 --> 01:16:13,092
You will not see one shekel from me.

657
01:16:13,642 --> 01:16:17,123
I don't need your money.
I'm not asking for it.

658
01:16:20,915 --> 01:16:22,958
It's only a year.

659
01:16:27,721 --> 01:16:29,744
Stay... on the river!

660
01:16:29,824 --> 01:16:32,714
Stay on the river! Stay on the river!

661
01:16:32,794 --> 01:16:35,471
Karl always said stay on the river!

662
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:52,523
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

663
01:16:55,183 --> 01:16:57,938
Okay, Yossi, just keep walking.

664
01:16:58,018 --> 01:16:59,895
Keep going.

665
01:18:30,494 --> 01:18:32,500
I know your type.

666
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:35,105
You just don't know when to give up.

667
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:04,054
Yossi.

668
01:19:34,864 --> 01:19:37,319
No! No! No!

669
01:20:02,703 --> 01:20:04,546
Look, Papá.

670
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:46,106
First of all, you'll see Captain Armando.

671
01:20:49,851 --> 01:20:52,540
If he didn't drown, he wouldn't just give up.

672
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,697
We have to go and find him.

673
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:26,925
Hello? Wait! No! Wait! Wait, wait!

674
01:21:27,005 --> 01:21:30,411
Hello! Hello! I'm here!

675
01:21:30,491 --> 01:21:33,681
Down here! Hello! No! No!

676
01:21:33,761 --> 01:21:35,305
No!

677
01:21:41,202 --> 01:21:43,680
Hey! Can't you fly any lower?

678
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,864
No, I can't do that.

679
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,828
No!

680
01:22:27,748 --> 01:22:30,754
Hey. We were so high,
we couldn't even see anything.

681
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:33,674
Listen, young man...

682
01:22:33,754 --> 01:22:36,998
- You tell me to listen. You keep telling me...
- Listen, please!

683
01:22:37,078 --> 01:22:39,932
It has been almost three weeks.

684
01:22:40,594 --> 01:22:43,238
There is no-one to look for.

685
01:22:43,697 --> 01:22:45,475
You don't know that.

686
01:22:46,134 --> 01:22:47,922
You did all you could.

687
01:22:48,002 --> 01:22:51,139
It's a miracle you survived. Now, go home.

688
01:22:51,219 --> 01:22:55,329
Listen, I know it doesn't make any sense
to you. I know that it seems hopeless.

689
01:22:55,409 --> 01:22:58,732
But I'm telling you, I know, in here,
I know in my heart, that he is alive.

690
01:22:58,812 --> 01:23:01,988
I just need some... I need some help. Okay?

691
01:23:02,068 --> 01:23:05,199
If you can just talk to the pilot,
just give me some kind of chance here.

692
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:08,230
Listen to me, I want to help you,
really, really, but...

693
01:23:08,522 --> 01:23:11,879
- You say that. You say that.
- I can't. I can't. I can't, really.

694
01:23:11,959 --> 01:23:13,614
- You can't?
- Yep, I can't.

695
01:23:13,694 --> 01:23:15,749
Okay, fine. You know what?

696
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:19,074
You don't want to help me,
I'll go upriver myself.

697
01:23:20,434 --> 01:23:22,991
What if you die in looking for him?

698
01:23:23,071 --> 01:23:24,914
Then I die!

699
01:23:29,677 --> 01:23:31,280
Okay, okay, okay.

700
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,823
Wait.

701
01:23:34,428 --> 01:23:35,925
Come.

702
01:23:39,019 --> 01:23:42,865
There is maybe... someone who can help.

703
01:23:45,559 --> 01:23:47,329
<i>Señor</i> Tico?

704
01:23:49,505 --> 01:23:51,562
Captain Armando...

705
01:23:52,042 --> 01:23:56,116
...told me that you know
the Tuichi River better than anyone.

706
01:23:57,388 --> 01:23:59,216
I have a friend...

707
01:23:59,296 --> 01:24:01,714
...who is lost in the river.

708
01:24:02,751 --> 01:24:04,561
The missing one?

709
01:24:05,878 --> 01:24:08,514
A gringo lost 17 days in the jungle?

710
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,555
He won't survive.

711
01:24:10,635 --> 01:24:14,475
Your friend is having a drink
with the Almighty up there.

712
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:18,354
No, my friend is alive...

713
01:24:18,434 --> 01:24:22,237
...and I need you to help me find him.

714
01:24:25,374 --> 01:24:26,979
I can't.

715
01:24:27,459 --> 01:24:31,575
I've never begged for anything. Anything.

716
01:24:31,655 --> 01:24:35,163
But I'm begging you now. Please.

717
01:24:36,744 --> 01:24:38,553
I'm sorry.

718
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:46,622
How much for the boat?

719
01:24:49,557 --> 01:24:51,400
Your boat.

720
01:24:52,293 --> 01:24:53,669
How much?

721
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:03,445
- Crazy <i>gringo.</i>
- Yeah, loco!

722
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:09,184
But really... I need it.

723
01:25:09,977 --> 01:25:11,487
Please.

724
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:13,827
No, no. Don't run! Please, don't run.
I'm not going to hurt you!

725
01:26:13,907 --> 01:26:17,665
I'm not going to hurt you! Please,
don't run away. It's fine, it's fine.

726
01:26:17,745 --> 01:26:22,658
My... my name... my name is Yossi.

727
01:26:22,983 --> 01:26:24,794
I am lost.

728
01:26:25,819 --> 01:26:29,009
Do you... do you speak... English?

729
01:26:29,089 --> 01:26:31,016
No, of course you don't...

730
01:26:32,993 --> 01:26:36,605
I know you can't
understand me, but... it's...

731
01:26:38,966 --> 01:26:40,810
...it's good to see you.

732
01:26:57,851 --> 01:27:00,394
We have to find the opening
in the river tomorrow...

733
01:27:00,474 --> 01:27:04,967
...so the... when the plane comes,
they... they can see us.

734
01:27:05,693 --> 01:27:07,950
I promise you, we'll be fine.

735
01:27:08,496 --> 01:27:11,151
And here. I know it's not... it's not much...

736
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:14,580
...but it's better
than just the ground, you know?

737
01:27:15,436 --> 01:27:18,425
Yeah, I'm not... just you, not...

738
01:27:18,505 --> 01:27:21,384
So that you're safe. Keep the bugs out.

739
01:27:23,577 --> 01:27:25,654
I'm going to protect you.

740
01:27:28,982 --> 01:27:33,039
I'm sorry, I just have to...
I just have to do one thing.

741
01:27:36,857 --> 01:27:38,546
Okay.

742
01:27:38,626 --> 01:27:41,036
I'm just... just checking.

743
01:27:58,846 --> 01:28:02,670
We just... have to keep heading
for Rurrenabaque...

744
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:04,559
...and never stop...

745
01:28:05,218 --> 01:28:08,479
...and always keep an eye for the plane.

746
01:28:08,689 --> 01:28:10,911
And the pilot's gonna see us...

747
01:28:10,991 --> 01:28:14,515
...he's gonna signal to us
with a tilt of his wings...

748
01:28:14,595 --> 01:28:16,438
...and we'll be saved.

749
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:20,253
And you're gonna meet my friends.

750
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:23,345
But out here, something...

751
01:28:23,837 --> 01:28:25,647
...happened to us...

752
01:28:33,814 --> 01:28:36,470
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm all right.

753
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:38,134
Look.

754
01:28:39,603 --> 01:28:42,075
See, I told you... we would find fruit.

755
01:28:42,155 --> 01:28:45,612
It's a bit rotten, but it's okay.

756
01:28:47,992 --> 01:28:52,376
You have to eat! No!
You have to eat! You have to eat!

757
01:28:52,456 --> 01:28:54,777
I can't do this by myself!

758
01:28:54,868 --> 01:28:57,292
You can't give up! Eat!

759
01:28:57,738 --> 01:29:01,217
I'm starving too!
I am hurting too! My feet are...

760
01:29:04,945 --> 01:29:08,101
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

761
01:29:08,181 --> 01:29:11,141
We all... we just have to... get some rest.

762
01:29:11,221 --> 01:29:15,709
And, look. Look, every night,
God sends us a tree to sleep under.

763
01:29:15,789 --> 01:29:18,746
This... this is a gift from God.

764
01:29:18,826 --> 01:29:22,816
We are not alone here.
God is walking beside us.

765
01:29:22,896 --> 01:29:25,544
You know, He has one hand on our shoulder.

766
01:29:25,999 --> 01:29:27,688
He is with us.

767
01:29:27,768 --> 01:29:30,258
Lie down here, next to me.

768
01:29:30,338 --> 01:29:33,949
It's fine. I'll just protect you.
We'll keep each other warm.

769
01:29:37,578 --> 01:29:41,390
That's it. It's going to be all right.

770
01:29:42,516 --> 01:29:45,727
Just... stay here with me.

771
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:48,864
We can sleep now.

772
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:51,566
You'll be safe.

773
01:29:52,325 --> 01:29:54,203
God is with us.

774
01:29:59,633 --> 01:30:02,890
It's okay. Just go to sleep.

775
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:05,114
Go to sleep.

776
01:30:23,456 --> 01:30:25,034
What?

777
01:31:18,226 --> 01:31:19,789
<i>Yeah!</i>

778
01:31:51,211 --> 01:31:52,787
No.

779
01:31:54,915 --> 01:31:57,125
No, no.

780
01:32:00,621 --> 01:32:04,499
Okay, no, don't... don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.

781
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:13,621
May God bless you and keep you.

782
01:32:13,781 --> 01:32:16,413
May God make his face shine
and show you his favor.

783
01:32:16,493 --> 01:32:19,015
May God lift up his face and give you peace.

784
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:27,077
Come home alive, Yossi.

785
01:33:40,687 --> 01:33:42,497
Stay with me.

786
01:33:43,023 --> 01:33:46,715
Don't you fucking break. Don't you break.

787
01:34:08,516 --> 01:34:11,882
Come on. Come on. Come on.

788
01:34:16,491 --> 01:34:17,832
Yes.

789
01:34:41,514 --> 01:34:43,771
<i>We have to find the opening
in the river tomorrow...</i>

790
01:34:43,851 --> 01:34:47,540
<i>We have to find the opening
in the river, so they can see us...</i>

791
