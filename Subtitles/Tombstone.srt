00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,212
1879. The Civil War is over,

3
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,250
and the resulting economic explosion
spurs the great migration west.

4
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:48,263
Farmers, ranchers, prospectors,
killers and thieves...

5
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,492
seek their fortunes.

6
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:53,297
Cattle drovers turn cow towns
into armed camps...

7
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:58,864
with murder rates higher than those
of modern-day New York or Los Angeles.

8
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:02,378
Out of this chaos comes
legendary lawman Wyatt Earp,

9
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:06,347
retiring his badge and gun to start
a peaceful life with his family.

10
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,941
Earp's friend
John 'Doc' Holliday...

11
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:11,782
a Southern gentleman
turned gunman and gambler...

12
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:17,054
also travels west, hoping the dry
climate will relieve his tuberculosis.

13
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:19,391
Silver is discovered
in Arizona.

14
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:22,295
Tombstone becomes
queen of the boomtowns,

15
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:26,426
where the latest Paris fashions are sold
from the backs of wagons.

16
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,131
Attracted to this
atmosphere of greed,

17
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:31,867
over 100 exiled Texas outlaws
band together...

18
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:36,674
to form the ruthless gang recognized
by the red sashes they wear.

19
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:41,410
They emerge as the earliest example
of organized crime in America.

20
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:45,011
They call themselves
'The Cowboys'

21
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:22,294
Y'all killed
two Cowboys.

22
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,860
- ¡Detenganse!
- Shoot.

23
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,335
- Looks like we win.

24
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,010
Mexican police, huh?

25
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,224
Tell him to get on his knees.

26
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,162
¡De rodillas, cabron!

27
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,893
¡De rodillas,
dijo, chingada!

28
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,207
He won't no kneel, patron.
He is very proud.

29
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:39,176
- Hey, somebody get
this dick on his knees.

30
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,805
¡Ay, Dios! ¡Ay, Dios!

31
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,543
Good shot, Billy.

32
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:49,281
- ¡Gracias!

33
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,450
They call me
Curly Bill Brosius.

34
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:58,987
I'm what you might call
the Founder of the Feast.

35
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:04,002
So next time we come,
you'd better step aside.

36
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,732
I ain't kiddin' neither.

37
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,743
Un caballo bajando
por la montana...

38
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,008
y el que lo cabalgue
ira a la muerte.

39
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,346
¡Moriremos!

40
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:21,045
Patron,
he say, uh,

41
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,112
someone will come
to revenge for him.

42
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,920
Something like a, a... sick horse
who comes to sit with him.

43
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,587
He talk crazy.
No entiendo un carajo.

44
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,529
That's not what he said,
ya ignorant wretch.

45
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,863
Your Spanish is worse
than your English.

46
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,428
You go to hell!

47
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,737
- You first.

48
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:46,300
- ¡No!

49
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,210
¡No! ¡No!
- What have we got here?

50
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,469
- Hell, let's eat, boys.
Tamales are good, huh?

51
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,062
I guess they knew
we were comin'.

52
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:22,777
Temor de Dios. Temor de Dios
es lo que ustedes no tienen.

53
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:25,749
- ¡Muerete, hijo de Satanas!

54
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,957
Hey, Johnny, what'd
that Mexican mean...

55
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:43,331
'a sick horse is
gonna get us,' huh?

56
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,371
He's quoting the Bible,

57
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,533
Revelations.

58
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,305
Behold, a pale horse.

59
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:56,337
'The man who sat on him
was Death.

60
00:06:56,415 --> 00:07:00,476
And hell followed with him.'

61
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,843
Move!

62
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:35,142
- Come on! That's it!
You move!

63
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,156
- Stupid mule!

64
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,192
Come on!

65
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,523
Come on!
Come on!

66
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,666
Hurts, don't it?

67
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,439
Now let go of that stud and
go on about your business.

68
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:13,717
Mr. Earp.
My name's Dake.

69
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,523
Crawley Dake, U.S. Marshal
for this territory.

70
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:19,428
- Forget it. I'm retired.
- Excuse me?

71
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:22,990
I said forget it.
I don't want the job, and that's final.

72
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,527
- I don't think you understand.
- No, you don't understand, Marshal.

73
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:30,632
I did my duty, and now I'd
like to get on with my life.

74
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,338
- I'm going to Tombstone.
Easy on the grain, Butch.
- I see.

75
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,347
- Here you go.
- To strike it rich.
Well, all right, that's fine.

76
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,248
Tell you one thing, though:
Never saw a rich man...

77
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:42,287
who didn't wind up
with a guilty conscience.

78
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:46,791
I already got a guilty conscience.
Might as well have the money too.

79
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,623
Good day now.

80
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:56,260
That's him, all right.
Boy, I'd know that sour face anywhere.

81
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,440
Virgil! Morgan!
My god!

82
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:10,504
- Hey, boy! How are you, Morgan?
- Hi, Wyatt.

83
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,245
- Well, how do we look?
- Great, both of ya.

84
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,220
- Wyatt, you remember Allie.
- Good God. Well, he'd better.

85
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,381
Allie girl.

86
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,550
- And Louisa. Oh!
- Wyatt.

87
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,720
You're so lovely, darlin'.
I'm at your feet, just at your feet.

88
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,788
I guess it's only right.
Ma always said Morgan's the prettiest.

89
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,825
- Yeah, but she doted on the Frowner.
- That's right.

90
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,269
- Wyatt.
- Mattie!

91
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,399
Mattie, they're already here.
Folks, this is Celia Andon.

92
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,444
- You can call her Mattie.
- Pleased to meet you, Mattie.

93
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,946
It's nice to meet you.

94
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,949
Well, Wyatt, I couldn't
find a single store that
had laudanum anywhere.

95
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,680
That's all right, honey.
I sure been dreamin' about this.

96
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,121
God, since forever!
Wait! Look here.

97
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,126
I wanna...
Look. Huh?

98
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,665
- Hey, Wyatt...
- Don't talk, just...

99
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,793
Yeah.

100
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,269
Thank you for this, Wyatt.

101
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:10,206
- It's all your doin'.
- We'll make our fortune, boys.

102
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,506
Well, come on.

103
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,147
Gracious.
We could be sisters.

104
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,113
Mighty fine.
I wonder where he found her.

105
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:20,708
Same place we found ours, probably.

106
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:27,158
'Matter, honey?
Did you say you needed some laudanum?

107
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:30,285
- Yes, I did. Yes.
- I have some right here.

108
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:33,297
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

109
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:36,300
Just be careful now.
It's full of hop.

110
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:39,337
Oh, don't worry. I just
get headaches sometimes.

111
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:42,305
Hey, Virg, see anything of Doc
while you were in Prescott?

112
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:45,309
Yeah. He had a streak
when we left, him and Kate.

113
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:48,141
I miss Doc.
I miss that old rip.

114
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:51,614
- I don't.
- He makes me laugh.

115
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:56,887
Yeah!

116
00:10:56,988 --> 00:11:01,448
- That's $500, Holliday.
Are you in or out?

117
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:15,265
Five hundred.
Must be a peach of a hand.

118
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:22,607
Oh, thank you, darlin'.

119
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,276
Kate! You're not
wearing a bustle.

120
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:28,546
How lewd.

121
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,454
Come on, Holliday,
you in or out, goddammit?

122
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:36,119
Why, Ed Bailey, you look like
you're just about ready to burst.

123
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:39,823
Come on! Come on, show!

124
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:44,631
Well, I suppose
I'm deranged, but I...

125
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,263
guess I'll just
have to call.

126
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,069
Cover your ears, darlin'.

127
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,836
Isn't that a daisy?

128
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:57,939
Why, you son-of-a-bitch!

129
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:59,984
Damn, Bailey, just settle down!

130
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:04,147
Shut up! Take your
money and get out,

131
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:06,850
'cause I'm tired of
listenin' to your mouth.

132
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:09,894
Why, Ed Bailey,

133
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:12,452
are we cross?

134
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,125
Them guns don't scare me.

135
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:20,501
'Cause without them guns
you ain't nothin' but a skinny lunger.

136
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:23,973
Ed, what an ugly thing to say.

137
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:28,945
- I abhor ugliness. Does this
mean we're not friends anymore?
-

138
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,643
You know, Ed, if I thought
you weren't my friend,

139
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:35,811
I just don't think
I could bear it.

140
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:56,304
There. Now we can
be friends again.

141
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,920
- Touch that gun,
I'll burn you down.

142
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,833
I calculate that's
the end of this town.

143
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:27,395
I had a boy at the hotel pack us up.
The horse is outside.

144
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,600
So that's why you're
not wearin' a bustle.

145
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:36,710
My sweet, soft
Hungarian devil.

146
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,288
Well!

147
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:50,685
Good evenin', then.

148
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,301
Let's not bother
about the luggage.

149
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:45,773
Hyah!

150
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:23,515
Hey, Morg,
pretty big, isn't it?

151
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:31,889
Oh-ho, brother, you can smell
the silver in this town.

152
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:34,955
- Easy.
- Look at these girls over here.

153
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:38,127
- Hi!
- Hello, girls!

154
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,637
Hot damn, this burg's jumpin'!

155
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:43,196
Here we go, ladies.

156
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:47,472
- Isn't that sweet?
- You can say that.

157
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:57,648
- Sheriff.

158
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:08,663
Newcomers, eh?

159
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:12,066
The name's John Behan,
Cochise County Sheriff.

160
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,400
- Just in town?
- Just this minute.

161
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:18,841
- I'm Wyatt Earp, and these are
my brothers, Virgil and Morgan.
- Wyatt Earp. Dodge City.

162
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,073
Gave all that up, Sheriff.
Goin' into business.

163
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:26,480
- Don't even carry a gun anymore.
- Going into business, huh?

164
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:29,247
Well then, I'm the man to see.

165
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,788
Besides sheriff,
I'm also tax collector,

166
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:35,257
Captain of the Fire Brigade and Chairman
of the Nonpartisan Anti-Chinese League.

167
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:37,726
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?

168
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,798
Yeah, a man of many parts.

169
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:45,302
- Say, you folks got
a place to stay yet?
- No.

170
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,033
- Like I said, we just got here.
- Well, I also sit on
the town lot commission.

171
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:51,405
Really?

172
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:56,379
As a matter of fact, we got three
lovely cottages coming up for rent.

173
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:59,473
I'll throw in a good cleaning,
no charge.

174
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,644
Believe me, Mr. Earp,

175
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,984
you're not gonna find a better deal
within town limits.

176
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:07,490
I don't know,
sounds pretty good.

177
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,427
- Well, I'll have my man show 'em to ya.
- Thank you.

178
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:21,238
Hey, Wyatt,
get on over here.

179
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,139
I want you to meet Fred White.
He's the town marshall.

180
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,403
- My pleasure.
- Lotta law around here.

181
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:29,469
- I already met the county sheriff.
- Who, Behan?

182
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:33,381
He ain't no law. The only real law
around here is the Cowboys.

183
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:37,615
Cowboys? I had a run-in
with a couple of them up in Prescott.

184
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,783
Nobody does nothin' without 'em.
I mean, they're it.

185
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:43,418
There are three of 'em
right over there.

186
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:47,863
You can always spot a Cowboy.
They always wear those red sashes.

187
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:51,800
- The main fact is the Cowboys
are good for business.
- 'Bout all these saloons?

188
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:54,929
Oh, that's the real mother lode
here in Tombstone.

189
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:57,440
All up and down
Allen Street here.

190
00:17:57,508 --> 00:18:00,306
Twenty-four hours a day,
you got liquor, hostesses, gamblin';

191
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,778
makin' money
hand-over-fist.

192
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:07,147
All except 'the Oriental.'
That's a regular slaughterhouse.

193
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:10,153
Even the high rollers
won't go near it.

194
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:14,214
That's too bad too.
It's a nice place.

195
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:17,159
Hell of a waste.

196
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:20,061
- Wyatt?

197
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:22,361
- There he goes.
- Yeah.

198
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:27,730
OI' Wyatt.

199
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,211
All right, fella,
I'll brace ya now for a little lesson.

200
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,806
Put your money on the board.
Five dollars on that six of spades.

201
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,443
Like that.

202
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,888
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Get that cigar outta my face.

203
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:47,584
Howdy, stranger.
What can I get ya?

204
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,820
I wouldn't mind
one of those cigars.

205
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,557
I'm about ready to go home.
I wish y'all would stop yakkin'...

206
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,758
- and just play cards.
- Thank you.

207
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,768
Kinda nice in here.
You run it?

208
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,031
Milt Joyce: Owner, operator.

209
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,541
- Wyatt Earp.
- Yeah, sure.

210
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:06,338
I said lay off the queen,
you jackass!

211
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,278
I swear I'm gonna
slap somebody now.

212
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:14,512
Excuse me for askin', Milt,
but... kinda dead in here, isn't it?

213
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,453
- You don't listen too good, do ya?
- See that bird at the faro table?

214
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:20,685
You back that queen again,
you son-of-a-bitch,

215
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,853
I'll blow you right up
that wildcat's ass!
Do you hear me, huh?

216
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,831
He comes bargin' in here one day,
slappin' the customers,
wavin' his gun around.

217
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,333
He chased out all
the high-class play.

218
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:34,395
The only trade that comes in
here now is the bummers and
the drovers; just the dregs.

219
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:38,067
Why don't you get rid of him,
get yourself a straight dealer?

220
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,441
Sure, stranger,
that's easy for you to say.

221
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,413
Shit!

222
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,482
Goddammit, Junior, how many times
am I going to tell you...

223
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:52,649
to keep that damn cigar
outta my face? Huh?

224
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:56,683
Christ almighty, it's like I'm
sittin' here playing cards with
my brother's kids or somethin',

225
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:59,093
you nerve-wracking
sons-of-bitches.

226
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,624
Is somethin' on your mind?

227
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,637
Just want to let you know
you're sittin' in my chair.

228
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,105
Is that a fact?

229
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,608
Yeah, it's a fact.

230
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:15,635
For a man that don't go heeled, you run
your mouth kinda reckless, don't ya?

231
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,650
No need to go heeled to get
the bulge on a tub like you.

232
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,585
- Is that a fact?
- Mm-hmm.

233
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,418
That's a fact.

234
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,984
Well, I'm real scared.

235
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:34,930
Damn right, you're scared.
I can see that in your eyes.

236
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,491
- All right now!
- Go ahead.

237
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,665
Go ahead, skin it! Skin that
smoke wagon and see what happens.

238
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,007
Listen, mister,
l-I'm gettin' awful tired of your...

239
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:50,343
I'm gettin' tired of your gas.
Now jerk that pistol and go to work.

240
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,120
- I said throw down, boy.

241
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:07,598
You gonna do somethin',
or just stand there and bleed?

242
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,833
No?

243
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,540
I didn't think so.

244
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,443
Here, Milt, a keepsake.

245
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:27,049
Hang it over the bar.
All right, youngster, out you go.

246
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,847
Don't come back!

247
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,357
Ever!

248
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,295
Well, what do you say, Milt?

249
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,857
Twenty-five percent
of the house take sound about right?

250
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,369
Hyah!

251
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,243
Well, we're off and runnin'.

252
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:56,542
Just acquired us a quarter interest
in a game at 'the Oriental.'

253
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:58,809
- Acquired?
- So to speak.

254
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,281
Now all we gotta do is keep our
eyes on that brass ring, fellas.

255
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,053
You're the one, Wyatt.

256
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,459
Why, Johnny Tyler!

257
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:14,521
- You madcap!
- Doc?

258
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,966
Where you goin'
with that shotgun?

259
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,369
I didn't know you
was back in town.

260
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,403
Well, well.

261
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,640
How the hell are you?

262
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:32,672
Wyatt, I am rolling.
Morgan.

263
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,515
- Doc.
- Virgil.

264
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,351
'Lo, Doc.

265
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,948
Wyatt Earp?

266
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,829
Going into business
for ourselves, Doc.

267
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,232
- Wyatt just got us a faro game.
- Oh.

268
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:53,896
Since when is faro
a business?

269
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,373
- Didn't you always say that
gambling's an honest trade?
- No.

270
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:01,776
I said poker's an honest trade.
Only suckers buck the tiger's
odds all on the house.

271
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:06,044
Depends on how you look at it.
I mean, it's not like anybody's
puttin' a gun to their head.

272
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:10,520
That's what I love about Wyatt.
He can talk himself into anything.

273
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:16,685
Oh. Johnny, I apologize.
I forgot you were there.

274
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:19,025
You may go now.

275
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,589
Just leave that shotgun.

276
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:29,035
Leave it.

277
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,869
Thank you.

278
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,941
Sheriff Behan!

279
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,984
- Gentlemen!
- Sheriff,

280
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:43,714
- have you met Doc Holliday?
- Piss on you, Wyatt.

281
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:48,119
Mr. Holliday.

282
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,560
Forgive me
if I don't shake hands.

283
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,129
- So, how's our little town suit you?
- Fine. Fine.

284
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,899
You know, I was thinking, what this town
could really use is a racetrack.

285
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:05,204
Really? That's not a bad idea.
Send a signal we're growin' up.

286
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:09,337
Way ahead of yourselves,
aren't you, boys? This
is just another mining camp.

287
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:12,975
Have you seen how everyone dresses?
Awful tony for a mining camp.

288
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,485
No sir, the die is cast.
We are growin'.

289
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:19,080
- Be as big as San Francisco in
a few years, and just as sophisticated.

290
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:23,116
- You son-of-a-bitch!

291
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:25,685
Easy, gents!
It's a private affair!

292
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:30,723
- Don't raise that iron.
I'm gonna have to...
- I'll kill you, you cheap son-of-a...

293
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,367
Very cosmopolitan.

294
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,069
I know him.
That's Creek Johnson.

295
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,813
Wyatt? Doc?

296
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:50,243
- Jack.
- What do you say, old friend?

297
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,458
What the hell's that
all about, Creek?

298
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,825
- He crawfished a bet
and called me a liar.
- Sheriff,

299
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:02,265
may I present a pair
of fellow sophisticates:
Turkey Creek Jack Johnson,

300
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,358
Texas Jack Vermillion.

301
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:07,996
Watch your ear, Creek.

302
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:11,633
- Afraid I'll have to have those guns.
- It was a fair fight.

303
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:15,145
- We was legal.
- I'm sorry, boys. I gotta
take 'em before Judge Spicer.

304
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,738
Hand 'em over.

305
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:20,113
Law and order every time,
that's us.

306
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,853
- Ha!

307
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:33,563
Whoa!

308
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,364
I'm frightfully thirsty.

309
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,370
Well, we made it.

310
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,976
Sheriff,
what kinda town is this?

311
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,114
Nice scenery.

312
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:01,523
Well,

313
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,653
an enchanted moment.

314
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:14,004
Interesting little scene. I wonder
who that tall drink of water is.

315
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,803
My dear, you have set your gaze
upon the quintessential frontier type.

316
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:21,936
Note the lean silhouette, eyes closed
by the sun; they're sharp as a hawk.

317
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:26,382
He's got the look of
both predator... and prey.

318
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,783
I want one.

319
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,447
Happy hunting.

320
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,715
- Hey, sister boy, gimme some!

321
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,949
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- Leave him alone, Barnes!

322
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,924
Billy, sit with me.

323
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:18,634
This is so much fun. We haven't
been to the show in six years.

324
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,331
I hope they're good.

325
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,303
- Wyatt?
- Oh, sorry.

326
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,081
Darlin', you know the Earps.

327
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,346
Kate, how you been?

328
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,755
Mattie, hmm, ravishin'.

329
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,349
Doc.

330
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,691
Wyatt, I'd like ya
to meet Mayor Clum and his wife.

331
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:50,700
- Mr. Earp.
Your reputation precedes you.
- Mayor.

332
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:54,864
- I was wondering if you might be...
- Not a prayer. Nice meetin' you.

333
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:12,485
Professor Gillman? Oh, I seen him
in Bisbee. He catches stuff.

334
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:15,048
Hey, Professor,
catch this.

335
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,892
They're shooting at us!
They're actually shooting at us.

336
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:23,900
- I guess we'll have
to wait for our notices.

337
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,903
Prettiest man I ever saw.

338
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,702
Whoo!

339
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,369
- Whoo-hoo!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

340
00:28:33,444 --> 00:28:36,106
the St. Crispin's Day
speech from Henry V.

341
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,115
- To set the scene...

342
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,344
Goddamn, Barnes!
- Shot his damn ear off.

343
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,183
- 'Lf we are marked to die,

344
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,689
'we are now to do
our country loss.

345
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:51,855
But if to live, the fewer men,
the greater share of honor... '

346
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:55,126
He's got some nerve, I'll say that.
What d'ya think there, Billy Nilly?

347
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:59,033
- I think he's wonderful.

348
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:01,071
'... gentle his condition.

349
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,597
'Gentlemen in England now abed
shall think themselves accurs'd
they were not here,

350
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:08,578
- 'And hold their manhoods cheap...

351
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:12,980
whilst any speaks who fought with us
upon Saint Crispin's day.'

352
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,884
- That's great!
That's our kinda stuff!

353
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,295
Play it again!

354
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,574
Now what in the hell is this?

355
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:43,637
Th-That's Faust.
H-He's gonna make a deal with the devil.

356
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:47,014
Is your soul
for sale, dear?

357
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:03,432
Know what I'd do?

358
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:07,130
I'd take the deal, then crawfish
and drill that old devil in the ass.

359
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:13,277
How 'bout you, Juanito?
What would you do?

360
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:18,441
I already did it.

361
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,660
Very instructive.

362
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,303
- Hmm.

363
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,976
But who is the devil?

364
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,116
I'll be damned.

365
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,296
You may indeed,
if you get lucky.

366
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,571
Would you look
at all those stars?

367
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,837
I mean, you look up and you think,
'God made all of that?

368
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,471
He still remembered to make
a little speck like me.'

369
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,482
Kinda flattering,
really.

370
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,280
Wyatt, do you
believe in God?

371
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:31,378
- No, come on, really. Do ya?
- Yeah. Maybe.

372
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:34,721
- Hell, I don't know.
- Well, what d'you think
happens when you die?

373
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,556
Somethin'. Nothin'.
Hell, I don't know.

374
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:40,529
Well, I read this book,
a book on spiritualism.

375
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,066
Oh, God, here
he goes again.

376
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,069
Said that a lot of people
when they die, they see this light.

377
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,571
- Like in a tunnel.
- Yeah?

378
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:51,574
- They say it's the light
leadin' you to Heaven.
- Really?

379
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:55,203
- Well, what about Hell?
They got a sign there, or what?
- Hey, Wyatt, goddammit.

380
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,715
- I'm serious.
- Hey, Morg. Comin'
to the Oriental, Virg?

381
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,081
- Well...
- Not tonight.

382
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:04,019
Tonight, me and my old man
are gonna have some fun.

383
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,352
Come on, get movin',
old man.

384
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,359
Maiden name was Sullivan.

385
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:16,833
- Well, you better go with them,
honey. I gotta go to work.
- Please stay with me.

386
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:20,393
Well, honey, l-I
gotta get to work.

387
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,668
All right.
All right.

388
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:27,142
Well, wait a minute. I guess
I don't have to go right now. I...

389
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,203
- I could stay awhile.
- No, no. I don't wanna keep you.

390
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,806
No, really,
I can stay awhile.

391
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:37,514
That the bottle
Lou gave you?

392
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,022
Yes, it is.

393
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,355
Maybe you should
see a doctor.

394
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:47,229
Wyatt, it's
just headaches.

395
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,665
I know what I'm doing. No,
I don't need to see a doctor!

396
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,295
- All right, honey. Okay.
- Just go.

397
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,238
Everything's fine, Wyatt.

398
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,401
- Work well.
- All right, good night.

399
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,445
You look beautiful tonight.

400
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,143
Thank you.

401
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,689
- Night, Mattie.
- Good night, Morgan.

402
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,656
Come on.

403
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,596
- I want to match
seven, seven stinkin' spades.

404
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,103
- Let's go.
- I'm your man.

405
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,140
You win again. Well played, sir.
You are on fire.

406
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:32,869
- I told you, I'm burnin' up tonight.
- Loser on the ace.

407
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,879
I'll take the red seven,
and I got some deeds here.

408
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,542
- I'll take seven stinkin' diamonds.
- Awww-ful lot of money.

409
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,882
- You can't stand the heat, pal,
get out of the kitchen.
- You're the doctor.

410
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,286
Sad news, friend,
you lose.

411
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,087
- So, now we're in
the mining business.
- You're the one, Wyatt.

412
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,754
We're turnin' into
regular tycoons.

413
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,128
Think I'll call this one
the Mattie Blalock. Mattie'd
get a kick outta that one.

414
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,827
- That's her maiden name.
- And what a maiden.

415
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,837
- Pure as the driven snow, I'm sure.
- Hey, Doc, come on now.

416
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:04,363
It's just his style, Morg.
He doesn't mean anything.

417
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,070
Tell me something,
my friend. I'm curious.

418
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:11,547
Do you actually consider yourself
a married man, forsaking all others?

419
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,777
Yeah, pretty much.

420
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:17,719
I mean, I was no angel
when we met, but neither was she.

421
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:22,248
People can change, Doc.
Sooner or later, you gotta grow up.

422
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,692
I see.

423
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:28,528
And what would you do,
if she walked in here?

424
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,059
- 'She'?
- You know damn well who I mean.

425
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,901
That dusky-hued
lady satan, that's who.

426
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,237
- Oh, I'd probably ignore her.
- Ignore her?

427
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,244
I'd ignore her.
People can change, Doc.

428
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,678
I'll remember
you said that.

429
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,080
- What?

430
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:52,955
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Ma'am? Miss Marcus?

431
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,754
Aw, hell.

432
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,620
Bravo!

433
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,737
Whoo!

434
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,814
Miss Marcus, allow me
the pleasure of a drink.

435
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,856
- Thank you, sir.
- Milt, champagne!

436
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,016
Satisfied?

437
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:31,687
I stand corrected, Wyatt.
You're an oak.

438
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,075
- Thanks, Kate.

439
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,917
Mr. Fabian.

440
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,819
- Well done.
- Well done.

441
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,858
Good show, partner,
good show.

442
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,485
Mr. Fabian, would you
come sit at my table?

443
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:08,032
Mr. Earp, would you mind signing
an autograph for me, sir?

444
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,363
Mr. Earp, would you mind signing
an autograph for me, sir?

445
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:13,767
My wife's not gonna
believe this.

446
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:21,369
Wyatt Earp, huh?
Heard of you.

447
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:26,078
Listen now,
Mr. Kansas Law Dog.

448
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,210
Law don't go around here.
Savvy?

449
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,222
- I'm retired.
- Good.

450
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,088
That's real good.

451
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,596
Yeah. Yeah, that's real good, law dog,
'cause law just don't go around here.

452
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:43,430
Yeah, I heard you the first
time. Winner to the king.
Five hundred dollars.

453
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:52,439
- Shut up, Ike.
- You must be Doc Holliday.

454
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,411
That's the rumor.

455
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:59,313
You retired too?

456
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,546
Not me.
I'm in my prime.

457
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,612
Yeah, you look it.

458
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,184
- Uh, you must be Ringo.

459
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,162
Look, darlin',
Johnny Ringo,

460
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:18,224
the deadliest pistoleer
since Wild Bill, they say.

461
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:22,102
What do you think, darlin',
should I hate him?

462
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:25,404
- You don't even know him.
- No. That's true,

463
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:29,435
but... I don't know, there's
just somethin' about him.

464
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,812
Somethin' 'round the eyes.

465
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,977
I don't know.

466
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:39,284
Reminds me of...

467
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,757
me.

468
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:45,227
No. I'm sure of it,
I hate him.

469
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,594
He's drunk.

470
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,463
In vino veritas.

471
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:54,903
Age quod agis.

472
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,782
In pace requiescat.

473
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:14,814
Come on, boys, we don't want any
trouble in here, not in any language.

474
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,122
That's Latin, darlin'.

475
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:20,357
Evidently, Mr. Ringo's
an educated man.

476
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,956
Now I really hate him.

477
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,526
- Watch it, Johnny.

478
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,665
- I hear he's real fast.

479
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,984
- Come on. Go, Johnny.

480
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,899
- Yeah!

481
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,375
- Bravo!

482
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,956
- Drinks are on me!
- Whoo!

483
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,393
Gettin' kinda spooky
around here.

484
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,904
- Curly Bill, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

485
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:12,773
- Who was that other idiot?
- Ike Clanton.

486
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:16,643
- Table's open!
- The man dealing faro, who is he?

487
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:21,981
That's Wyatt Earp. Built a name for
himself as a peace officer in Kansas.

488
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,317
Hmm, peace officer.

489
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,823
Very impressive.

490
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,758
I believe he's married.

491
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,158
More champagne?

492
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,019
Oh, hell.

493
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:08,059
- Hello.
- Hello.

494
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,794
We've, uh, we've never actually met.
My name is...

495
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,063
Wyatt Earp.
Yes, I know.

496
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,401
- I'm Jos...
- Josephine Marcus.

497
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,940
Everybody knows.

498
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,907
I was beginning to think
we'd never meet.

499
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,176
This is fortuitous.
That means 'lucky.'

500
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,911
Yeah, I...
I know what it means.

501
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,180
- Easy now.

502
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:33,155
- What is it?
- That mare is in season.

503
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,591
Bet she's starting.

504
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:41,324
- How do they know?
- They know. It's the scent.

505
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,263
Ah!

506
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,366
- Well, I guess we'd better split
'em up. It's been real n...
- I have a better idea.

507
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,669
Let's run it out of them.

508
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,745
Yeah, I'm an oak,
all right.

509
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,821
- Whoa!

510
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,824
Well, end of the road.

511
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,417
- Maybe for you. Hyah!
- Hyah!

512
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,080
That was lovely.

513
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:10,177
Lovely? You could've been
killed back there, or busted up.

514
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,381
Fun, though,
wasn't it?

515
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:15,391
- You'd die for fun?
- Wouldn't you?

516
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,392
Oh, he's laughing. I didn't
think you ever laughed.

517
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:22,830
Yeah, I...
I laugh sometimes.

518
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,702
Yes, but how often?
Are you happy?

519
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:30,772
Am I happy? Well, I don't know.
I'm happy as the next man, I guess.

520
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,832
I don't laugh all day long like
an idiot, if that's what you mean.

521
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:37,141
- Touchy about it, aren't you?
- No, I'm not touchy. I'm just...

522
00:43:37,213 --> 00:43:41,843
It's a silly question, is all.
'Am I happy? Are you happy? '
Are you happy?

523
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:44,978
Oh, I'm always happy,
unless I'm bored.

524
00:43:45,054 --> 00:43:47,989
That blonde woman,
is that your wife?

525
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:51,526
What about her?

526
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:55,530
Nothing. What do you
want out of life?

527
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,600
Geez!

528
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:02,331
- How do you get these questions?
- Just answer.

529
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:04,839
I don't know!
Make some money, I guess.

530
00:44:04,907 --> 00:44:08,468
- Maybe... have some children.
- Doesn't suit you.

531
00:44:08,544 --> 00:44:12,378
- Well, how would you know?
- It just doesn't, that's all.

532
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:16,214
I oughta know my own mind,
and I'm telling you what
suits me is a family and kids.

533
00:44:16,285 --> 00:44:19,254
Suits me right down to the ground.
In fact, that's my idea of heaven.

534
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:23,122
- All right, what's
your idea of heaven?
- Room service.

535
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:29,425
Oh, he's laughing again.
Well, that's what I want.

536
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:33,401
I wanna move and go places
and never look back.

537
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:35,903
Just have fun, forever.

538
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:40,102
That's my idea of heaven.
Need someone to share it with, though.

539
00:44:40,176 --> 00:44:42,872
You mean Behan.

540
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:48,915
Well, then...

541
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:51,715
Why are you with him?

542
00:44:51,788 --> 00:44:55,747
Because he's handsome
and he's charming and...

543
00:44:55,825 --> 00:44:59,659
He's all right.
For now.

544
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:02,220
Oh, I know, don't say it,
I'm rotten.

545
00:45:02,298 --> 00:45:05,995
I've tried to be good.
It's just so boring.

546
00:45:06,068 --> 00:45:08,536
The way you talk.

547
00:45:08,604 --> 00:45:11,903
Never heard a woman
talk like that?

548
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:15,674
Never.

549
00:45:15,745 --> 00:45:20,205
I don't have time to be proper.
I wanna live.

550
00:45:20,283 --> 00:45:22,979
I'm a woman.
I like men.

551
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:27,421
If that means I'm not ladylike,
then I guess I'm just not a lady.

552
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,221
- At least, I'm honest.
- You're different.

553
00:45:31,294 --> 00:45:33,387
There's no arguin' that.

554
00:45:33,462 --> 00:45:37,091
But you're a lady,
all right.

555
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:40,533
I'll take my oath on it.

556
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,975
- Giddap! Come on!

557
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:08,357
Is that the opium
Lou gave you?

558
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:13,793
It's a new bottle,
isn't it?

559
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,805
You better go easy
on that stuff.

560
00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:20,365
Wyatt, leave me alone.

561
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:23,935
- And where've you been?
- Just out.

562
00:46:24,013 --> 00:46:26,948
- Hmm.
- Ridin'.

563
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:34,689
- How're you feelin', Mattie?

564
00:46:36,859 --> 00:46:40,226
Uh, uh...
I don't know. Uh...

565
00:46:40,296 --> 00:46:42,491
I'm all right.

566
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:46,633
I'm fine.

567
00:46:46,702 --> 00:46:49,694
- You sure?
- Su... I'm sure.

568
00:46:51,107 --> 00:46:55,339
Well, I was
thinkin' today,

569
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:58,346
we've already made
a pile of money in this place.

570
00:46:58,414 --> 00:47:01,406
If we pulled up stakes
and just moved on, you know,

571
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:04,510
then we could stay on the move,
keep goin', see the world.

572
00:47:04,587 --> 00:47:08,318
Just... live on room service
for the rest of our lives.

573
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:10,859
How'd that be?

574
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:15,023
Room serv...

575
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:19,227
Wyatt, what're you
talkin' about?

576
00:47:22,104 --> 00:47:24,299
Nothin'. I just...

577
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:27,638
Just thinkin' out loud,
and you know I...

578
00:47:29,078 --> 00:47:32,013
Nothin'.

579
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:36,384
Forget about it.

580
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:52,400
Ow!

581
00:47:55,004 --> 00:47:57,939
What's she doin' with that lunger?

582
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:12,011
Hey!

583
00:48:13,522 --> 00:48:15,854
Hey!

584
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:19,827
Is that 'Old Dog Trey'?
That sounds like 'Old Dog Trey' to me.

585
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,024
Pardon?

586
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,432
You know, Stephen Foster.

587
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:29,767
'Oh! Susanna,'

588
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,364
'Camptown Races.'

589
00:48:34,243 --> 00:48:36,507
Stephen stinkin' Foster!

590
00:48:36,579 --> 00:48:39,013
Uh, yes, well,

591
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:42,141
this happens to be
a nocturne.

592
00:48:42,218 --> 00:48:45,085
- A which?
- You know,

593
00:48:45,154 --> 00:48:48,487
- Frederic fucking Chopin.

594
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:01,035
Oh, yeah.

595
00:49:14,984 --> 00:49:17,919
Boy, I feel great.

596
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:22,883
I feel... just...

597
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:25,893
capital.

598
00:49:45,681 --> 00:49:49,515
- Yaahhh!

599
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:57,555
- Do you see what's
going on in the street?

600
00:49:57,626 --> 00:50:00,493
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- I believe you're the sheriff.

601
00:50:00,563 --> 00:50:04,727
No, no, no, no. This is
not county business. This is
a town matter. Marshal?

602
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,325
Yaahhh!

603
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:10,429
- Why don't you just leave it alone?

604
00:50:10,506 --> 00:50:15,443
No, I, uh...
I gotta do somethin'.

605
00:50:15,511 --> 00:50:19,174
Wah-hoo-wahhh!

606
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:21,773
Here's your down card.

607
00:50:40,836 --> 00:50:43,498
- Curly Bill!

608
00:50:46,342 --> 00:50:48,708
Come on now.

609
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:51,245
Well, howdy, Fred.

610
00:50:51,313 --> 00:50:55,374
Hand those over, Curly.
Hand 'em over.

611
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:01,780
Why, sure, Dad.

612
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:05,795
I'm only funnin'.

613
00:51:05,928 --> 00:51:07,953
Here you go.

614
00:51:20,543 --> 00:51:23,376
Fred?

615
00:51:23,445 --> 00:51:26,642
Come on now. Fred?

616
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:32,919
- Got ol' Fred White!
- Hey, everybody!

617
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:37,118
Better get him
off the street.

618
00:51:37,193 --> 00:51:40,128
Fred White's dead! They killed him.
They killed Fred White!

619
00:51:40,196 --> 00:51:44,360
- All right, back off.
- Get a rope! String him up!

620
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:47,266
- Nobody's hangin' anybody.
- He just killed a man!

621
00:51:47,336 --> 00:51:50,499
Then he'll stand trial for it.
Now get back! Move!

622
00:51:52,575 --> 00:51:55,601
Turn him loose!

623
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,815
He said to turn
loose of him.

624
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,656
- Well, I'm not; so, go home.

625
00:52:11,727 --> 00:52:16,664
I swear to God, law dog, you don't
step aside, we'll tear you apart.

626
00:52:16,732 --> 00:52:20,293
All right, you die first.
Get it?

627
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:25,671
Your friends might get me
in a rush, but not before
I make your head into a canoe.

628
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:30,201
- He's bluffin'. Let's rush him.
- No... he ain't bluffin'.

629
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:33,339
You're not as stupid
as you look, Ike.

630
00:52:33,415 --> 00:52:37,146
- Now tell them to get back.
- Go on now, get back.

631
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:40,916
Go on!
Billy!

632
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:44,687
He'll kill me.

633
00:52:47,396 --> 00:52:51,093
- And you, music lover,

634
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:53,396
you're next.

635
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:56,927
It's the drunk piano player.

636
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:59,998
You're so drunk,
you can't hit nothin'.

637
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:03,511
In fact, you're
probably seein' double.

638
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:08,039
I have two guns,
one for each of ya.

639
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:11,211
All right, back it up now!

640
00:53:16,592 --> 00:53:18,890
Go home now!

641
00:53:29,638 --> 00:53:33,369
I'll see you soon.

642
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:36,900
- I'll see you soon.
- We'll meet again.

643
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:44,580
Well, as you can see,

644
00:53:44,653 --> 00:53:47,451
never a dull moment.

645
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,013
So it takes Judge Spicer
three weeks to get back to town,

646
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:18,019
and he says, 'Well,
did you actually see it? '

647
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:21,579
I said, 'No. By the time I got there,
Marshal White had already been shot.'

648
00:54:21,657 --> 00:54:24,592
Then Spicer leans forward
and he says,

649
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,652
- 'Well, can't have a murder
without a witness.'

650
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:30,358
- What?
- Case dismissed. Can you beat it?

651
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:34,198
After all that?
Aw, hell, who cares?

652
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:36,737
None of my business anyway.

653
00:54:36,805 --> 00:54:39,433
Ready to go, Milt?

654
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:43,069
God, I love this game!
You know, boys, when we're finally set,

655
00:54:43,145 --> 00:54:46,114
we gotta each have
a billiard room in our houses.

656
00:54:46,181 --> 00:54:48,615
I been thinkin',

657
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:51,881
maybe we oughta open up
a place of our own. You know?

658
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:55,390
- There's the real money. Build it up,

659
00:54:55,457 --> 00:54:58,051
Milk it for all it's worth,
then sell it off for a bundle...

660
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:01,927
and breeze outta this burg
with more money than Cresus
and ready to live like kings.

661
00:55:01,997 --> 00:55:05,489
What d'ya think, Virg?

662
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:08,661
Virg?

663
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:11,672
Why don't you and me
take a walk around town...

664
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,904
and see if we can't spot us out
a couple of nice lots?

665
00:55:15,978 --> 00:55:19,141
It's workin' out just
like you said, Wyatt.

666
00:55:19,214 --> 00:55:23,480
- Goddamn, boys, we're lootin'
this burg six ways from Sunday.
- Pretty fun too, isn't it?

667
00:55:23,552 --> 00:55:27,648
- Actually, yeah, I gotta admit.
- Excuse me. Wyatt,
do you have a moment?

668
00:55:27,723 --> 00:55:31,750
- Will you just hear me out?
- Now hold on, Mayor.
He already told you now.

669
00:55:31,827 --> 00:55:33,920
You tell him, Morg.

670
00:55:33,996 --> 00:55:37,523
What about you?
You were a lawman.

671
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:41,899
- I'm busy.

672
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,097
We're all busy.

673
00:55:44,173 --> 00:55:48,337
Sorry, Mayor, but you're
barkin' up the wrong tree.

674
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:51,277
You know, you men are makin'
a lot of money in this town.

675
00:55:51,346 --> 00:55:54,076
That's good. That's good.
Good for you.

676
00:55:54,149 --> 00:55:57,380
In the meantime, a lot of
decent people are suffering.

677
00:55:57,453 --> 00:56:02,083
But, please, don't let me take up
any more of your precious time.

678
00:56:06,195 --> 00:56:08,356
Rack 'em.

679
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,888
I tell ya, I'm suffering.
From a hangover.

680
00:56:19,775 --> 00:56:22,039
- Stop that!

681
00:56:22,111 --> 00:56:24,409
Stop. No.

682
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:22,898
Hold on a minute!
Wait a minute!

683
00:57:22,971 --> 00:57:26,372
- Calm down and listen to me!

684
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:29,376
Nobody's sayin'
you can't own a gun.

685
00:57:29,444 --> 00:57:32,538
Nobody's even sayin'
you can't carry a gun.

686
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:36,015
All we're sayin' is you
can't carry a gun in town.

687
00:57:39,922 --> 00:57:43,790
That's not so bad,
is it?

688
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:51,232
Listen, Mayor, I have
to talk to you about this.

689
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,531
No, we don't have to talk.
You can read, can't you?
It's a town matter.

690
00:57:54,603 --> 00:57:59,404
What in the hell are you doin'?
I told you we weren't gettin' involved.

691
00:57:59,474 --> 00:58:02,068
You got us involved
when you brought us here.

692
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:05,238
Now you hold on
a minute, Virg.

693
00:58:05,314 --> 00:58:08,909
Hold on nothin'!
I walk around this town and
look these people in the eyes.

694
00:58:08,984 --> 00:58:11,851
It's just like someone's
slappin' me in the face.

695
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,354
These people are afraid
to walk down the street,

696
00:58:14,423 --> 00:58:17,358
and I'm tryin' to make money off
that like some goddamn vulture!

697
00:58:17,426 --> 00:58:20,862
If we're gonna have a future
in this town, it's gotta have
some law and order.

698
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:22,920
Don't do this to me!

699
00:58:22,998 --> 00:58:26,661
- It's got nothin' to do
with you! It's got to do wi...
- Nothin' to do with me?

700
00:58:26,735 --> 00:58:29,898
I'm your brother, for Christ's sake!
God, I don't believe this!

701
00:58:29,972 --> 00:58:33,430
Talk to him, will you?
Or hit him!

702
00:58:36,345 --> 00:58:38,540
Ah, God, don't tell me!

703
00:58:38,614 --> 00:58:41,048
Like you said, Wyatt,
we're brothers.

704
00:58:41,116 --> 00:58:45,177
Gotta back your brother's play.
Just did like I figured you would.

705
00:58:45,254 --> 00:58:49,054
All right now, you listen
to me, both of ya!

706
00:58:50,492 --> 00:58:52,926
For the first time
in our lives,

707
00:58:52,995 --> 00:58:55,429
we got a chance to stop wandering
and finally be a family.

708
00:58:55,497 --> 00:58:58,466
This is trouble we don't need.
You saw what happened to Fred White.

709
00:58:58,533 --> 00:59:00,763
We know what
we're doin', Wyatt.

710
00:59:00,836 --> 00:59:04,932
Okay, fine. Say you're right,
say you don't get yourself killed.

711
00:59:05,007 --> 00:59:07,771
There's somethin' else.

712
00:59:07,843 --> 00:59:13,008
All those years I worked those
cow towns, I was only ever mixed
up in one shootin', just one.

713
00:59:13,081 --> 00:59:16,380
But a man lost his life,
and I took it.

714
00:59:16,451 --> 00:59:18,817
You don't know how
that feels, Morg.

715
00:59:18,887 --> 00:59:22,653
Believe me, boy,
you don't ever wanna know.

716
00:59:22,724 --> 00:59:25,716
Not ever.

717
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:35,169
Didn't even make a dent, did I?

718
00:59:35,237 --> 00:59:38,570
All right.

719
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,871
You're both makin' a big mistake.

720
00:59:47,683 --> 00:59:54,680
# What remained of our day
in the sunshine #

721
00:59:54,757 --> 01:00:00,889
- # That brightened
our pathway a while #
- Do you wanna ante?

722
01:00:00,963 --> 01:00:07,732
- Yeah, fine.
- # Come and sit by my side
if you love me #

723
01:00:07,803 --> 01:00:14,766
# Do not hasten
to bid me adieu #

724
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:21,909
# But remember
the Red River Valley #

725
01:00:21,984 --> 01:00:27,388
# And the girl who has
loved you so true #

726
01:00:27,456 --> 01:00:32,291
- What do you think of the singer?
- # Will you think of the vow... #

727
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:35,421
Nice voice.

728
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:39,559
Wyatt, Doc won't quit.
He's been at it for 36 hours straight.

729
01:00:39,635 --> 01:00:42,570
Clanton and the McLaury brothers
came in an hour ago.

730
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:48,235
- I tried to get him to go to bed,
but he won't let go.
- I know, and nobody can make him.

731
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:56,015
Wyatt, just in time.
Pull up a chair.

732
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:59,953
Doc, you been hittin' it
awful hard, haven't ya?

733
01:01:00,022 --> 01:01:05,392
Nonsense. I've not yet
begun to defile myself.

734
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,952
I was wonderin' if you
wouldn't wanna go on over
to the Crystal Palace...

735
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:10,624
I will not be pawed at,
thank you very much.

736
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:12,633
- I'm sorry.
- That's right.

737
01:01:12,701 --> 01:01:15,670
Doc can go on day and night,
and then some.

738
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:21,910
That's my loving man.
Have another one, my loving man.

739
01:01:21,977 --> 01:01:24,912
I'm in.

740
01:01:25,981 --> 01:01:27,915
Straight.

741
01:01:27,983 --> 01:01:31,749
Loving man,
you been called.

742
01:01:38,894 --> 01:01:41,055
Oops.

743
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,630
What is that now?

744
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:51,833
That 12 hands in a row, Holliday?
Son-of-a-bitch, nobody's that lucky.

745
01:01:52,908 --> 01:01:56,708
Why, Ike,
whatever do you mean?

746
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:59,509
Take it easy, boys.

747
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:04,579
Maybe poker's
just not your game, Ike.

748
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:10,322
I know, let's have
a spelling contest.

749
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:13,987
- How 'bout if I just
wring your scrawny neck?
- Enough, Ike.

750
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,959
Are you takin'
his part? Huh?

751
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:21,196
I'm the one
who got cheated!

752
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:26,003
You goddamn pimps!
You all in it together.

753
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:29,476
Nobody's in anything.
Ike, you're drunk.
Go on home and sleep it off.

754
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:32,309
Get your goddamn hands off me!

755
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:34,906
Don't you ever put
your hands on me, see?

756
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:38,647
Don't you ever try to manhandle
a Cowboy, 'cause we'll cut
your goddamn pimp's heart out.

757
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,849
- Understand me, pimp?
- Don't you threaten me,
you little son-of-a-bitch!

758
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,484
All right! All right!
Come on, easy, Virg, easy!

759
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,529
You just go on home and
forget about it, huh, Ike?

760
01:02:47,596 --> 01:02:50,064
Come on, Virg.

761
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:52,566
I ain't gonna forget nothin'.

762
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:57,265
Well, that certainly was a bust.

763
01:02:57,339 --> 01:03:02,606
Come, darlin'. Let's seek
our entertainment elsewhere.

764
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:05,841
Forget it, Virg. Go on.
Get some fresh air.

765
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,227
What's wrong, Doc?

766
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,559
Nothin'. Not a thing.

767
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,258
I'm right as the mail.

768
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:29,700
Doc? Doc!

769
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:32,969
All right, get him up.
Let's get him to the hotel.

770
01:03:42,017 --> 01:03:44,577
- What's wrong with him?
- Lunger.

771
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:47,451
Yeah, well, I hope you die.

772
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:51,049
Give me my guns.

773
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,029
My rifle.

774
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:58,225
Goddamn bastards.
Think they can cheat me.

775
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,359
Nobody cheated you, Ike.
Just go home.

776
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:05,271
I don't take no mouth
from no bartenders, neither.

777
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,275
There, ya see?

778
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,801
Give somebody a rap on the beezer,
get some respect around here.

779
01:04:10,879 --> 01:04:15,248
You tell the Earps, I see 'em
on the street and Doc Holliday,

780
01:04:15,317 --> 01:04:19,014
I'm gonna send them to hell
on a shutter. You tell 'em that...

781
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,461
Pick these guns up.

782
01:04:27,529 --> 01:04:29,463
Come on.

783
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:46,804
Come on, Ike.

784
01:04:46,882 --> 01:04:48,873
Come on!

785
01:04:50,986 --> 01:04:53,819
- Hey, you walkin'?
- Leave me alone.

786
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:03,127
- You gonna give Ike back his guns.
- Not 'til he sobers up.

787
01:05:03,198 --> 01:05:06,964
Wearin' that badge
don't make you right.

788
01:05:07,035 --> 01:05:09,629
Who the hell
you think you are?

789
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:17,335
- Watch the way you walk,
you stupid bastard.
- Easy, kid, I'm sorry.

790
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:20,041
I ain't easy
and I ain't your kid.

791
01:05:20,115 --> 01:05:23,482
You take your sorry
and shove it up your ass.

792
01:05:26,588 --> 01:05:28,715
I'll fight you right now.

793
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,198
Goddammit!

794
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,234
You're gonna bleed.

795
01:05:39,301 --> 01:05:42,737
You got a fight comin'.
Comin' today.

796
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:49,677
Bastards! We're comin'!

797
01:05:56,785 --> 01:05:59,310
Your condition's
quite advanced.

798
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:03,552
I'd say you lost some 60%
of your lung tissue, maybe more.

799
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,559
What's the verdict?

800
01:06:05,627 --> 01:06:10,530
Two years. Two days.
Hard to say, if you stop now:

801
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:13,500
Your smokin',
your drinkin',

802
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,833
your gamblin',
your night life.

803
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:18,702
You need complete rest.

804
01:06:20,108 --> 01:06:24,340
What I mean is,
you must attempt to, uh, deny...

805
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:28,907
- your, uh, marital impulse.
- Get out of my sight.

806
01:06:47,302 --> 01:06:50,203
- How are you feeling, Doc?
- Mmm, better.

807
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,638
That's good.

808
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:55,541
I knew it wasn't nothing.

809
01:06:56,845 --> 01:06:59,370
We must talk, darlin'.

810
01:07:00,782 --> 01:07:03,114
It appears, uh...

811
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:08,487
we must redefine the nature
of our association.

812
01:07:12,961 --> 01:07:16,397
I'm a good woman
to you, Doc.

813
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,025
Don't I always
take care of ya?

814
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:22,002
Nobody cares for you
like me.

815
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:25,300
I'm a good woman.

816
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:30,801
Yes, it's true,
you are a good woman.

817
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:45,724
Then again...

818
01:07:45,794 --> 01:07:50,398
you may be the Antichrist.

819
01:08:11,085 --> 01:08:13,713
Goddamn.

820
01:08:13,788 --> 01:08:18,316
Now there's six of 'em.
Hell, this is like a bad dream.

821
01:08:18,392 --> 01:08:21,691
Just stay calm. Use your head.
It'll be all right.

822
01:08:24,999 --> 01:08:27,160
Just the same, though...

823
01:08:28,536 --> 01:08:31,505
Guess maybe you better
swear me in.

824
01:09:06,507 --> 01:09:10,910
Those Cowboys been telling everybody
in town they're gonna clean you out.

825
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:14,436
They're back there in that lot
behind the O.K. Corral.

826
01:09:15,816 --> 01:09:18,341
- Thank you, Mayor.
- What're you doin' out of bed, Doc?

827
01:09:18,419 --> 01:09:20,819
What in the hell's goin' on?
Five people come up to my room...

828
01:09:20,888 --> 01:09:24,915
tellin' me the Clantons and McLaurys
are gunnin' for us.

829
01:09:24,992 --> 01:09:29,554
- We goin' down there or not?
What are we gonna do?
- Wait 'til the liquor wears off.

830
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:32,155
Soon as they start gettin' headaches,
they'll lose interest.

831
01:09:32,233 --> 01:09:35,430
Lose interest, hell.
They're threatenin' our lives.

832
01:09:35,503 --> 01:09:38,802
- You'll never make that stick.
- They're carryin' guns, Wyatt.

833
01:09:38,873 --> 01:09:40,807
Christ's sake, Virg,
that's a misdemeanor.

834
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:44,572
You go arrest them, something
goes wrong, maybe somebody
really gets his head broken.

835
01:09:44,645 --> 01:09:48,103
You'll have Cowboys
comin' around lookin' for
trouble from here to Christmas.

836
01:09:48,182 --> 01:09:51,618
- You want to risk all that
over a misdemeanor?
- Damn right I'll risk it.

837
01:09:51,685 --> 01:09:54,085
They're breakin' the law.

838
01:09:59,827 --> 01:10:03,228
It's not your problem, Doc.
You don't have to mix up in this.

839
01:10:05,432 --> 01:10:09,232
That is a hell of a thing
for you to say to me.

840
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:22,213
All right, Virg.

841
01:10:24,318 --> 01:10:27,685
Your call.
Give Doc the shotgun.

842
01:10:28,923 --> 01:10:31,050
They'll be less apt
to get nerv-i-ous...

843
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,355
if he's on
the street howitzer.

844
01:11:17,104 --> 01:11:19,038
Hey! Bang bang
bang bang bang!

845
01:11:19,106 --> 01:11:21,734
Go on! Get home!

846
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:25,335
Goddamn kid.

847
01:11:35,756 --> 01:11:39,385
How the hell did we
get ourselves into this?

848
01:11:42,329 --> 01:11:45,492
You don't have to worry about a thing.
I just disarmed them.

849
01:11:45,566 --> 01:11:48,160
You did?
Come on, boys.

850
01:11:48,235 --> 01:11:51,534
Gentlemen, I'm not
gonna allow any trouble.

851
01:12:14,862 --> 01:12:18,354
We're here to disarm you.
Throw up your hands.

852
01:12:22,069 --> 01:12:24,867
Hold it!
That's not what I want!

853
01:12:59,173 --> 01:13:01,107
Oh, my God.

854
01:13:09,883 --> 01:13:12,647
Billy! Billy!

855
01:13:19,259 --> 01:13:21,727
Stop! No! No!

856
01:13:21,795 --> 01:13:24,525
Don't shoot!
I got no gun!

857
01:13:24,598 --> 01:13:27,897
- Please don't shoot me!
I got no gun!
- This fight's commenced!

858
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:30,232
Get to fightin' or get away!

859
01:13:31,705 --> 01:13:34,697
- Unh!
- Shut the door!

860
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:41,547
Aah!

861
01:13:50,057 --> 01:13:52,457
Give me your goddamned gun!
Damn it!

862
01:13:52,526 --> 01:13:54,994
Billy! Billy!

863
01:13:55,062 --> 01:13:57,394
Doc, behind us!

864
01:14:23,924 --> 01:14:26,449
I got you now,
you son-of-a-bitch.

865
01:14:26,527 --> 01:14:28,461
You're a daisy if you do.

866
01:14:42,643 --> 01:14:45,168
Morgan, hold quiet now.

867
01:14:56,056 --> 01:14:58,650
Here you go.
Easy. Easy, man.

868
01:14:58,725 --> 01:15:01,523
- I got you. All right.
- All right!

869
01:15:03,497 --> 01:15:06,057
All of you
are under arrest.

870
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:20,612
I don't think I'll let you
arrest us today, Behan.

871
01:15:49,376 --> 01:15:51,310
Virg!

872
01:15:51,378 --> 01:15:53,938
- Virgil!

873
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,036
Well, I guess we did
our good deed for today, Mayor.

874
01:17:41,722 --> 01:17:45,283
You were right.
It's nothin' like I thought.

875
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:48,851
- I almost wish that...
- I know, Morgan.

876
01:17:50,564 --> 01:17:52,657
I know. Me too.

877
01:18:04,978 --> 01:18:07,105
Outta the way!
Yee-haw!

878
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:13,219
Gettin' warmer.

879
01:18:13,287 --> 01:18:15,847
Guess spring's comin'.

880
01:18:15,923 --> 01:18:20,724
- Hello, Billy. I say hello.
- It's deputy! And I don't
want to talk to you!

881
01:18:20,794 --> 01:18:23,058
Those men you killed
were my friends.

882
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:27,226
I'm just a nothin'. But if
I wasn't, I'd fight you right now,

883
01:18:27,301 --> 01:18:29,701
so I don't
want to talk to you.

884
01:18:31,905 --> 01:18:34,237
All they ever did
was laugh at him.

885
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:46,481
Sister boy should've
stuck around.

886
01:18:48,255 --> 01:18:52,692
- What do you want, Ringo?
- I want your blood.

887
01:18:54,261 --> 01:18:56,661
And I want your souls.

888
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,426
And I want 'em both right now.

889
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:02,867
- I don't want any more trouble.
- Well, ya got trouble!

890
01:19:04,505 --> 01:19:07,599
And it starts with you.

891
01:19:11,178 --> 01:19:13,738
I'm not gonna
fight you, Ringo.

892
01:19:15,048 --> 01:19:17,209
There's no money in it.

893
01:19:17,284 --> 01:19:19,582
Sober up.
Come on, boys.

894
01:19:19,653 --> 01:19:22,087
You wretched slugs.

895
01:19:22,156 --> 01:19:25,557
Don't any of ya have the guts
to play for blood?

896
01:19:25,626 --> 01:19:28,117
I'm your huckleberry.

897
01:19:28,195 --> 01:19:31,596
That's just my game.

898
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:43,733
All right, lunger.
You go to hell.

899
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:48,145
- I'll put you out of your misery.
- Say when.

900
01:19:48,215 --> 01:19:51,844
- Johnny, don't!
- No, Johnny! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

901
01:19:51,919 --> 01:19:53,944
- Get off!
- Easy now! It ain't nothin'.

902
01:19:54,021 --> 01:19:56,649
- Get off!
- Don't mind him!

903
01:19:56,723 --> 01:19:59,749
He's just drunk,
that's all.

904
01:19:59,827 --> 01:20:02,955
Cool down, Johnny!

905
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:05,624
No! No!

906
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:08,497
I want them spittin' blood!

907
01:20:08,569 --> 01:20:11,868
- Easy, son, easy!
Now ain't the time!
- Slow down, Ringo.

908
01:20:14,842 --> 01:20:18,505
I tell ya, boys, even I'm wary
of what's gonna happen
once Ringo runs this outfit.

909
01:20:18,579 --> 01:20:21,275
God have mercy!

910
01:20:21,348 --> 01:20:25,307
Juanito, their time will come.
- Gentlemen.

911
01:20:25,385 --> 01:20:28,320
- You can pull it, boy!
- Let's go get sauced!

912
01:20:28,388 --> 01:20:30,583
- Barber.
- Yes, sir?

913
01:20:32,893 --> 01:20:34,827
Proceed, sir.

914
01:20:50,777 --> 01:20:55,180
Listen to me.
I need to speak with you.

915
01:20:55,249 --> 01:20:57,774
Not now. I'm busy.

916
01:20:57,851 --> 01:21:00,649
I see what's going on
between you and Wyatt.

917
01:21:00,721 --> 01:21:04,452
I'm not a fool.
And listen to me.

918
01:21:04,525 --> 01:21:09,224
Lots of so-called hard cases and
tough nuts come and go around this town,

919
01:21:09,296 --> 01:21:13,733
but none of them has a clue
about the real play... none of them.

920
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,395
Now after tonight, there'll be one man
in charge of Tombstone.

921
01:21:17,471 --> 01:21:21,567
You'll be happy to know him.
Bet on it.

922
01:21:29,783 --> 01:21:32,581
Gonna be one of those nights.

923
01:21:35,289 --> 01:21:38,520
It's gettin' late, boys.
I'm gonna go to bed.

924
01:21:38,592 --> 01:21:41,527
- Good night, Virg.
- Good night, Morg.

925
01:21:41,595 --> 01:21:45,361
Bundle up, Virg.
It's gettin' cold out there.

926
01:21:45,432 --> 01:21:47,297
Yeah.

927
01:22:14,094 --> 01:22:16,961
Tower of Babel.

928
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:19,521
Death and the Devil.

929
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:24,094
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, Allie. I wish you'd learn
to play a real card game.

930
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:31,473
- More tea, Mattie?
- Mm-mmm. No, no.

931
01:22:31,545 --> 01:22:33,479
- Are you all right, Mattie?
- Yes.

932
01:22:33,547 --> 01:22:36,175
- Are you expecting someone?
- Only Virg.

933
01:22:41,455 --> 01:22:44,822
Please. I know it's awful
to come here, but listen.

934
01:22:44,891 --> 01:22:47,519
I think something's
gonna happen tonight.

935
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:52,121
It's Virg.

936
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:54,827
- No! Get down!

937
01:23:12,786 --> 01:23:15,118
That thunder's
sure gettin' close.

938
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,265
Virgil. What'd ya forget?

939
01:23:41,314 --> 01:23:43,782
Wyatt.

940
01:23:55,862 --> 01:23:58,956
Will you hurry
with that water, please?

941
01:23:59,032 --> 01:24:01,193
Come on, Lou.

942
01:24:03,737 --> 01:24:06,297
Wyatt! Wyatt!

943
01:24:08,542 --> 01:24:11,340
They hit Claude's house too,
shot up his wife.

944
01:24:11,411 --> 01:24:13,572
His wife!
Whoever heard of that?

945
01:24:13,647 --> 01:24:16,878
They're bugs, Wyatt. All that
smart talk about live and let live.

946
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:18,884
There ain't no live
and let live with bugs.

947
01:24:18,952 --> 01:24:21,284
All right, you listen to me now.
We gotta get out of here.

948
01:24:21,354 --> 01:24:24,414
Get out of here?
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.

949
01:24:24,491 --> 01:24:27,324
Lie down and crawl or you might
get hurt? What kind of talk is that?

950
01:24:27,394 --> 01:24:29,385
- Do you see what's happening here?
- What?

951
01:24:29,463 --> 01:24:32,728
What do you mean?
What are you saying?

952
01:24:32,799 --> 01:24:34,733
No. Please, no.

953
01:24:34,801 --> 01:24:38,100
I'm afraid your husband's
going to lose the use of his arm.

954
01:24:38,171 --> 01:24:40,731
Oh, God, no.

955
01:24:40,807 --> 01:24:43,867
Don't worry, Allie girl.

956
01:24:43,944 --> 01:24:47,277
I still got one good arm
to hold you with.

957
01:24:48,915 --> 01:24:51,042
Goddamn...

958
01:24:51,117 --> 01:24:55,679
- Goddamn sons-of-bitches!
- Morgan, wait a minute! Virg...

959
01:24:55,755 --> 01:24:58,121
- You had to be so damned smart.
- I'm sorry, Allie.

960
01:24:58,191 --> 01:25:00,455
I told you, Virg.

961
01:25:00,527 --> 01:25:02,825
- Not now, Wyatt.
- All right.

962
01:25:02,896 --> 01:25:05,057
- All right, what do you want me to do?

963
01:25:05,131 --> 01:25:09,124
- Just leave me alone, for God's sakes.
- Virg...

964
01:25:09,202 --> 01:25:12,171
He doesn't want
to talk now, Wyatt!

965
01:25:28,254 --> 01:25:31,985
I heard about what they did
to your women. That was wrong.

966
01:25:32,058 --> 01:25:36,256
I'm here to let you know that it
wasn't me. I had no part of it.

967
01:25:36,329 --> 01:25:40,663
No? Brothers to the bone,
right, McMasters?

968
01:25:40,733 --> 01:25:44,965
No. Not anymore.
Not after this night.

969
01:25:45,038 --> 01:25:49,441
He's right, Wyatt. You want us
for anything, we're with you.

970
01:25:49,509 --> 01:25:51,477
Come on.

971
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,775
Hold him!

972
01:26:56,843 --> 01:27:00,779
- No! Get her out of here! Jesus!

973
01:27:00,847 --> 01:27:05,079
- Somebody shut that dog up!

974
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:10,414
- I said hold him, goddammit!

975
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:13,118
- Somebody get that
goddamn dog out of here!

976
01:27:13,192 --> 01:27:16,650
The bullet's too deep.
I can't get it out.

977
01:27:18,898 --> 01:27:21,526
- The way it's lodged
in there... I'm sorry.

978
01:27:21,601 --> 01:27:24,695
Easy, Morg.
Is that better?

979
01:27:25,772 --> 01:27:27,706
Yeah.

980
01:27:30,276 --> 01:27:34,474
You were right, Wyatt.
They got me good.

981
01:27:36,316 --> 01:27:40,582
Don't let 'em get you, brother.
You're the one.

982
01:27:41,654 --> 01:27:44,487
Easy, Morg.

983
01:27:44,557 --> 01:27:47,617
Don't worry about that, now.

984
01:27:51,497 --> 01:27:54,830
Remember what I said
about seein' a light when you're dyin'?

985
01:27:54,901 --> 01:27:58,359
Yeah. Yeah.

986
01:27:58,438 --> 01:28:00,599
That ain't true.

987
01:28:00,673 --> 01:28:03,608
I can't see a damn thing.

988
01:28:06,646 --> 01:28:08,580
Morg?

989
01:28:12,952 --> 01:28:14,886
Morg!

990
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,494
Morg?

991
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:38,476
No.

992
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,914
Morgan! No!

993
01:28:42,982 --> 01:28:46,679
Morgan, don't die!
I love you!

994
01:28:46,753 --> 01:28:48,812
Don't die!

995
01:29:01,567 --> 01:29:04,661
Why? Why him?

996
01:29:08,007 --> 01:29:12,273
- No. No, get away from me!
- Wyatt!

997
01:29:13,446 --> 01:29:16,540
Can't you see?
Get away from me!

998
01:29:51,551 --> 01:29:54,349
Morgan!

999
01:30:45,438 --> 01:30:48,430
And so she walked
out of our lives forever.

1000
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:08,726
Giddup!

1001
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:26,534
Want you to know it's over.

1002
01:31:28,915 --> 01:31:31,008
Well.

1003
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:33,051
Bye.

1004
01:31:35,054 --> 01:31:37,716
You smell that, Bill?

1005
01:31:39,325 --> 01:31:41,486
Smells like someone died.

1006
01:31:43,062 --> 01:31:46,759
Jesus, Johnny.

1007
01:31:56,742 --> 01:31:59,643
- Giddyap!

1008
01:31:59,712 --> 01:32:02,647
Adios, cabrones.

1009
01:32:08,921 --> 01:32:10,855
Ike.

1010
01:32:11,991 --> 01:32:15,392
Take Stillwell and finish it.

1011
01:32:30,876 --> 01:32:34,334
Now, you take care of yourself...

1012
01:32:34,413 --> 01:32:38,076
- That's Virgil with the women.
- He's mine!

1013
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:41,517
- All aboard!
- Hey, Mattie! Where's Wyatt?

1014
01:32:41,587 --> 01:32:44,215
Right behind you, Stillwell.

1015
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:46,451
- Aah!
- No!

1016
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:03,274
Sweet Jesus.

1017
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:23,485
All right, Clanton.

1018
01:33:23,562 --> 01:33:27,692
You called down the thunder.
Well, now you got it.

1019
01:33:29,668 --> 01:33:33,604
You see that? It says,
'United States Marshal.'

1020
01:33:33,672 --> 01:33:36,197
Wyatt.
Please don't kill me. Please.

1021
01:33:36,275 --> 01:33:40,575
Take a good look at him, Ike,
'cause that's how you're gonna end up.

1022
01:33:42,714 --> 01:33:45,274
The Cowboys are finished.
You understand me?

1023
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:48,877
I see a red sash,
I kill the man wearin' it.

1024
01:33:48,954 --> 01:33:50,979
So run, you cur.

1025
01:33:52,257 --> 01:33:56,921
Run! Tell all the other curs
the law is comin'!

1026
01:33:56,995 --> 01:33:59,327
You tell 'em I'm comin'!

1027
01:33:59,398 --> 01:34:02,333
And hell's comin'
with me, you hear?

1028
01:34:02,401 --> 01:34:05,199
Hell's comin' with me!

1029
01:34:38,337 --> 01:34:40,271
Nobody move!

1030
01:34:40,339 --> 01:34:43,797
- Nonsense. By all means, move.
-

1031
01:35:57,716 --> 01:36:00,480
-
- Get down!

1032
01:36:11,596 --> 01:36:14,724
Hey, Wyatt!

1033
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,961
How the hell are ya?

1034
01:36:23,408 --> 01:36:26,070
Ohh!

1035
01:36:29,314 --> 01:36:31,578
I got some boys
over there behind ya!

1036
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:34,619
Got you in a little crossfire.
How do ya like that?

1037
01:36:37,489 --> 01:36:40,458
Come on! Think of
something fast, would ya?

1038
01:36:42,661 --> 01:36:46,927
Wyatt?
Hey, Wyatt.

1039
01:36:46,999 --> 01:36:48,967
- No.
- Wyatt!

1040
01:36:50,936 --> 01:36:53,063
- No.
- Wyatt, what are you doin'?

1041
01:36:53,138 --> 01:36:55,470
Look at that.

1042
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:58,509
Yeah.

1043
01:36:58,577 --> 01:37:00,943
Come and get some, boy.

1044
01:37:05,884 --> 01:37:07,943
No! Let me!

1045
01:37:13,759 --> 01:37:16,922
- No.

1046
01:37:16,995 --> 01:37:20,761
- Son-of-a-bitch.
- No!

1047
01:37:25,804 --> 01:37:27,772
Jesus Christ!

1048
01:37:32,044 --> 01:37:34,535
Yaahh!

1049
01:37:37,816 --> 01:37:40,478
No. No!

1050
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:55,356
Did you ever see anything
like that before?

1051
01:37:55,434 --> 01:37:58,995
- Hell, I ain't never even
heard of anything like that.
- Nothin'.

1052
01:38:00,072 --> 01:38:02,006
Where is he?

1053
01:38:02,074 --> 01:38:05,510
Down by the creek,

1054
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:07,908
walkin' on water.

1055
01:38:07,979 --> 01:38:11,244
Well, let's hope he's got
another miracle up his sleeve.

1056
01:38:11,316 --> 01:38:15,309
'Cause if I know Ringo,
he's headed straight for us.

1057
01:38:15,387 --> 01:38:19,721
Well, if they were my brothers,
I'd want revenge too.

1058
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:22,521
No. Make no mistake.

1059
01:38:22,594 --> 01:38:25,893
It's not revenge he's after.

1060
01:38:27,766 --> 01:38:29,996
It's a reckoning.

1061
01:38:40,212 --> 01:38:44,842
Doc. You ought to be in bed. What
the hell you doin' this for anyway?

1062
01:38:44,916 --> 01:38:47,407
Wyatt Earp is my friend.

1063
01:38:47,486 --> 01:38:50,649
Hell, I got lots of friends.

1064
01:38:52,657 --> 01:38:54,750
I don't.

1065
01:39:05,103 --> 01:39:08,266
Whoa! Whoa!

1066
01:39:13,311 --> 01:39:15,245
My God.

1067
01:39:18,383 --> 01:39:21,284
- Are you all right?
- What do you care?

1068
01:39:21,353 --> 01:39:23,719
It was your friends
that did it.

1069
01:39:25,924 --> 01:39:29,587
Must've been Claiborne and Fuller.
They left here last night.

1070
01:39:29,661 --> 01:39:32,459
Aw, no.

1071
01:39:32,531 --> 01:39:35,364
They tried to take my watch.

1072
01:39:35,433 --> 01:39:39,335
He cursed them for cowards,
and they shot him.

1073
01:39:40,405 --> 01:39:44,205
I don't understand
any of this.

1074
01:39:44,276 --> 01:39:46,744
I just know it's ugly.

1075
01:39:46,811 --> 01:39:49,405
You're all ugly,

1076
01:39:49,481 --> 01:39:53,076
and he was beautiful.

1077
01:39:53,151 --> 01:39:57,451
He tried to bring something
fine into your ugly world,
and you shot him for it.

1078
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:03,685
Not that you care.

1079
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:18,537
- Billy. Where you goin'?
- I'm not goin' with you.

1080
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:20,908
Billy!
Billy, get back here!

1081
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:23,539
I'm sorry, sir,
but we got to have some law.

1082
01:40:23,615 --> 01:40:27,449
- Billy!
- Let him go. Who cares?

1083
01:40:27,519 --> 01:40:30,852
Yaahh! Get the hell
outta here! Go on!

1084
01:40:30,922 --> 01:40:33,755
Party's over, boys.
Let's go!

1085
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,574
Whoa.

1086
01:40:56,079 --> 01:40:59,242
Ringo and Behan
are out front.

1087
01:40:59,316 --> 01:41:03,343
There is about 30 of 'em.

1088
01:41:04,487 --> 01:41:06,421
They're all wearin' badges.

1089
01:41:08,358 --> 01:41:10,553
Christ.

1090
01:41:10,627 --> 01:41:14,757
We gotta find
a place to hole up.

1091
01:41:14,831 --> 01:41:16,958
Doc.

1092
01:41:17,033 --> 01:41:18,967
Grab him.

1093
01:41:21,237 --> 01:41:23,171
I got him.

1094
01:41:23,807 --> 01:41:25,741
I got him!

1095
01:41:31,348 --> 01:41:33,282
Is this Henry Hooker's ranch?

1096
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:36,012
That's right.
And I'm Hooker.

1097
01:41:36,086 --> 01:41:38,384
We got a sick man.

1098
01:41:38,455 --> 01:41:40,446
And our horses are done in.

1099
01:41:40,523 --> 01:41:42,889
Put him up at my place,

1100
01:41:42,959 --> 01:41:45,086
as long as it's just tonight.

1101
01:41:45,161 --> 01:41:47,129
We're in debt to ya.

1102
01:41:54,404 --> 01:41:59,899
I know you boys have got to keep movin',
but he looks pretty bad to me.

1103
01:42:03,246 --> 01:42:07,205
- Whoa!
- I, uh...

1104
01:42:27,771 --> 01:42:31,036
They got held up,
and their boss actor got killed.

1105
01:42:31,107 --> 01:42:34,406
They came here to water the horses,
then they'll push on.

1106
01:42:51,694 --> 01:42:55,630
I'm sorry about your friend.
And I'm... I'm sorry that I...

1107
01:42:55,698 --> 01:42:58,929
I forgave you
the moment you said it.

1108
01:42:59,002 --> 01:43:01,732
You did? Well...

1109
01:43:02,972 --> 01:43:04,906
Thank you.

1110
01:43:06,242 --> 01:43:08,301
All set.

1111
01:43:10,346 --> 01:43:12,644
I have to go.

1112
01:43:15,285 --> 01:43:17,253
Wait.

1113
01:43:36,973 --> 01:43:38,941
- Hyah!

1114
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:41,203
Giddup!

1115
01:44:03,233 --> 01:44:05,667
What the hell is that?

1116
01:44:25,421 --> 01:44:28,356
They got McMasters!

1117
01:44:28,424 --> 01:44:30,756
Geez!

1118
01:44:30,827 --> 01:44:33,421
Ringo wanted to make sure
he got your attention, Marshal!

1119
01:44:33,496 --> 01:44:36,488
He wants a straight-up fight,
just you and him,

1120
01:44:36,566 --> 01:44:38,830
to settle this thing
once and for all.

1121
01:44:38,902 --> 01:44:42,531
Oak grove at the mouth
of Silver Springs canyon, 7:00!

1122
01:44:42,605 --> 01:44:45,540
You tell him I'll be there!

1123
01:44:45,608 --> 01:44:49,203
- Are you crazy?
- I'll be there!

1124
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:51,770
It's not finished.

1125
01:45:06,729 --> 01:45:09,823
After I'm done
with Wyatt Earp,

1126
01:45:09,899 --> 01:45:14,836
take your Cowboys and finish off
Creek Johnson and Texas Jack.

1127
01:45:16,272 --> 01:45:18,263
You burn 'em, Ike.

1128
01:45:20,443 --> 01:45:25,107
- Burn 'em all.
- Hell, Johnny,
he ain't even gonna show.

1129
01:45:25,181 --> 01:45:27,308
Giddap!

1130
01:45:27,383 --> 01:45:30,045
He'll show.

1131
01:45:32,622 --> 01:45:36,888
I spent my whole life not knowin'
what I wanted outta life,

1132
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,451
just chasin' my tail.

1133
01:45:39,529 --> 01:45:43,226
Now for the first time
I know exactly what I want,

1134
01:45:43,299 --> 01:45:45,699
and who.

1135
01:45:46,803 --> 01:45:49,670
And that's
the damnable misery of it.

1136
01:45:54,611 --> 01:45:57,273
What makes a man
like Ringo, Doc?

1137
01:45:57,347 --> 01:46:00,339
What makes him
do the things he does?

1138
01:46:00,416 --> 01:46:03,180
A man like Ringo...

1139
01:46:03,253 --> 01:46:07,485
got a great empty hole
right through the middle of him.

1140
01:46:08,925 --> 01:46:13,726
He can never kill enough
or steal enough...

1141
01:46:13,796 --> 01:46:16,663
or inflict enough pain
to ever fill it.

1142
01:46:16,733 --> 01:46:19,167
What does he need?

1143
01:46:20,370 --> 01:46:22,304
Revenge.

1144
01:46:25,608 --> 01:46:28,202
For what?

1145
01:46:32,982 --> 01:46:34,916
Bein' born.

1146
01:46:48,765 --> 01:46:50,790
It all happened so fast
with Curly Bill...

1147
01:46:50,867 --> 01:46:52,960
I didn't really have time
to think about it,

1148
01:46:53,036 --> 01:46:55,527
but I've had plenty of time
to think about this.

1149
01:47:02,745 --> 01:47:05,213
I can't beat him, can I?

1150
01:47:07,183 --> 01:47:09,344
No.

1151
01:47:15,391 --> 01:47:19,327
Wait.
I'm goin' with ya.

1152
01:47:24,834 --> 01:47:28,861
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1153
01:47:28,938 --> 01:47:31,133
I'm sorry, Wyatt.

1154
01:47:31,207 --> 01:47:33,732
It's all right, Doc.

1155
01:47:36,879 --> 01:47:39,814
What's it like to wear
one of those?

1156
01:48:07,276 --> 01:48:09,210
Don't worry.

1157
01:48:09,278 --> 01:48:12,475
They want him,
they gotta come over us first.

1158
01:48:38,608 --> 01:48:43,602
He's waitin' for you by the big oak,
quarter mile up that trail.

1159
01:48:49,152 --> 01:48:52,451
They're not givin' ya
any safe conduct.

1160
01:48:52,522 --> 01:48:56,788
Shootin' starts, you better kick east
to the New Mexico line.

1161
01:48:59,295 --> 01:49:01,559
I ain't got the words.

1162
01:49:01,631 --> 01:49:04,225
I know.

1163
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:06,632
Me neither.

1164
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:16,144
Well.

1165
01:49:22,218 --> 01:49:25,422
I didn't think
ya had it in you.

1166
01:49:25,555 --> 01:49:28,456
I'm your huckleberry.

1167
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:33,961
Why, Johnny Ringo,

1168
01:49:34,030 --> 01:49:38,091
you look like somebody
just walked over your grave.

1169
01:49:39,169 --> 01:49:42,104
Fight's not with you, Holliday.

1170
01:49:42,172 --> 01:49:46,871
I'll beg to differ, sir. We started
a game we never got to finish.

1171
01:49:47,944 --> 01:49:50,310
Play for blood, remember?

1172
01:49:51,548 --> 01:49:54,779
I was just foolin' about.

1173
01:49:56,386 --> 01:49:58,320
I wasn't.

1174
01:49:59,722 --> 01:50:01,917
And this time...

1175
01:50:03,126 --> 01:50:05,720
it's legal.

1176
01:50:12,969 --> 01:50:16,871
All right, lunger.
Let's do it.

1177
01:50:50,306 --> 01:50:52,240
Say when.

1178
01:51:10,593 --> 01:51:14,586
Come on. Come on!

1179
01:51:14,664 --> 01:51:17,827
Oh, Johnny. Come on!

1180
01:51:22,672 --> 01:51:26,199
You're no daisy.
You're no daisy at all!

1181
01:51:27,343 --> 01:51:29,743
Poor soul.

1182
01:51:29,812 --> 01:51:32,713
You were just
too high-strung.

1183
01:51:42,659 --> 01:51:47,687
I'm afraid the strain
was more than he could bear.

1184
01:51:54,537 --> 01:51:59,065
Oh, I wasn't quite
as sick as I made out.

1185
01:52:01,511 --> 01:52:04,071
Good God.

1186
01:52:10,553 --> 01:52:13,454
My hypocrisy
goes only so far.

1187
01:52:18,461 --> 01:52:20,429
All right.

1188
01:52:20,496 --> 01:52:22,987
Let's finish it.

1189
01:52:23,066 --> 01:52:28,402
Indeed, sir. The last charge
of Wyatt Earp and his immortals.

1190
01:53:20,123 --> 01:53:23,058
Hyah! Hyah, come on!

1191
01:53:24,661 --> 01:53:27,596
No! Here!

1192
01:53:27,664 --> 01:53:29,598
Look at this!

1193
01:54:50,079 --> 01:54:52,013
Hello, Wyatt.

1194
01:54:52,081 --> 01:54:55,573
Father Feeney
and I were just...

1195
01:54:55,651 --> 01:55:01,021
investigating the mysteries
of the church of Rome.

1196
01:55:02,124 --> 01:55:07,528
It appears my hypocrisy
knows no bounds.

1197
01:55:07,596 --> 01:55:11,692
You're no hypocrite, Doc.
You just like to sound like one.

1198
01:55:11,767 --> 01:55:14,395
I brought you somethin'.

1199
01:55:20,009 --> 01:55:23,706
Well, let's see.
Where are we today?

1200
01:55:23,779 --> 01:55:27,340
I'm $17 down to you.

1201
01:55:27,416 --> 01:55:31,079
- Two bits a hand. Stud?
- You keep comin' back here.

1202
01:55:31,153 --> 01:55:33,917
I told you not to,
and I meant it.

1203
01:55:33,990 --> 01:55:37,551
You're the only person
I can afford to lose to anymore.

1204
01:55:40,329 --> 01:55:43,821
How we feelin' today, Doc?

1205
01:55:43,899 --> 01:55:46,663
I'm dying. How are you?

1206
01:55:46,736 --> 01:55:49,296
Pretty much the same.

1207
01:55:49,372 --> 01:55:53,934
- So now we add self-pity
to our list of frailties.
- All right, Doc.

1208
01:55:54,010 --> 01:55:57,343
All right, how many
cards you want?

1209
01:55:57,413 --> 01:56:00,712
I don't want
to play anymore.

1210
01:56:00,783 --> 01:56:03,513
How many?

1211
01:56:03,586 --> 01:56:08,614
Damn you.
You're the most fallible,

1212
01:56:08,691 --> 01:56:11,626
stubborn, self-deluded,

1213
01:56:11,694 --> 01:56:15,289
- bullheaded man I've ever
known in my entire life.
- I call.

1214
01:56:16,365 --> 01:56:18,595
- You win.
- Yet with all,

1215
01:56:18,667 --> 01:56:23,229
you're the only human being
in my entire life who ever gave me hope.

1216
01:56:29,879 --> 01:56:33,315
I was in love once.

1217
01:56:34,383 --> 01:56:36,408
My first cousin.

1218
01:56:36,485 --> 01:56:39,943
She was 15.

1219
01:56:42,324 --> 01:56:44,622
We were both so...

1220
01:56:45,694 --> 01:56:48,094
That's good, Doc.

1221
01:56:48,164 --> 01:56:50,860
That's... That's good.
What happened?

1222
01:56:54,003 --> 01:56:57,666
She joined a convent
over the affair.

1223
01:56:57,740 --> 01:57:00,675
She was all I ever wanted.

1224
01:57:02,378 --> 01:57:04,846
What did you want?

1225
01:57:04,914 --> 01:57:08,179
Just to live a normal life.

1226
01:57:08,250 --> 01:57:13,051
There's no normal life, Wyatt.
There's just life.

1227
01:57:13,122 --> 01:57:16,023
Now get on with it.

1228
01:57:16,092 --> 01:57:18,185
Don't know how.

1229
01:57:20,096 --> 01:57:23,862
Sure you do.
Say good-bye to me.

1230
01:57:25,101 --> 01:57:27,763
Go grab
that spirited actress...

1231
01:57:27,837 --> 01:57:31,136
and make her your own.

1232
01:57:31,207 --> 01:57:34,370
Take that beauty and run,
and don't look back.

1233
01:57:34,443 --> 01:57:38,743
Live every second.
Live right up to the hilt.

1234
01:57:38,814 --> 01:57:40,782
Live, Wyatt.

1235
01:57:41,917 --> 01:57:43,976
Live for me.

1236
01:57:45,321 --> 01:57:48,051
Wyatt? If you
ever were my friend,

1237
01:57:48,124 --> 01:57:51,389
if you ever had even
the slightest feelin' for me,

1238
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:53,951
leave now.

1239
01:57:54,029 --> 01:57:56,020
Leave now.

1240
01:58:00,369 --> 01:58:03,167
Please?

1241
01:58:13,782 --> 01:58:16,512
Thanks for always
bein' there, Doc.

1242
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,505
I'll be damned.

1243
01:58:49,185 --> 01:58:52,120
This is funny.

1244
01:59:11,674 --> 01:59:17,112
I never thought I would see
Gilbert and Sullivan performed
right here in Denver.

1245
01:59:17,179 --> 01:59:20,376
- Good night, Josie.
- Good night.

1246
01:59:20,449 --> 01:59:22,383
Good show.

1247
01:59:38,801 --> 01:59:42,362
Ya ever see the sun come up
over the Rockies?

1248
01:59:42,438 --> 01:59:46,841
It hits all of a sudden,
and below there's California.

1249
01:59:46,909 --> 01:59:50,003
And you swear
you're lookin' at heaven.

1250
01:59:57,853 --> 02:00:00,583
I have nothing left,

1251
02:00:00,656 --> 02:00:03,318
nothing to give you.

1252
02:00:03,392 --> 02:00:07,988
I have no pride,
no dignity.

1253
02:00:08,063 --> 02:00:12,796
No money. I don't even know
how we'll make a living, but...

1254
02:00:16,672 --> 02:00:19,698
I promise I'll love you
the rest of your life.

1255
02:00:35,090 --> 02:00:39,686
Don't worry, Wyatt.
My family's rich.

1256
02:00:46,201 --> 02:00:48,829
What shall we do first?

1257
02:00:48,904 --> 02:00:51,702
What you wanted to do
the first night we met.

1258
02:00:51,774 --> 02:00:54,641
- Remember?
- Uh-uh.

1259
02:00:56,178 --> 02:00:59,545
May I have this dance?

1260
02:00:59,615 --> 02:01:01,708
Yes.

1261
02:01:01,784 --> 02:01:04,719
And then we'll
have room service.

1262
02:01:11,427 --> 02:01:15,090
The power of the Cowboy Gang
was broken forever.

1263
02:01:15,164 --> 02:01:19,931
Ike Clanton was shot
and killed two years later
during an attempted robbery.

1264
02:01:20,002 --> 02:01:24,837
Mattie died of a drug overdose
shortly after she left Tombstone.

1265
02:01:24,907 --> 02:01:28,138
Virgil and Allie Earp
moved to California, where Virgil,

1266
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:31,839
despite the use of only one arm,
became a town sheriff.

1267
02:01:31,914 --> 02:01:35,873
Wyatt and Josephine
embarked on a series of adventures.

1268
02:01:35,951 --> 02:01:41,253
Up or down, thin or flush,
in 47 years they never left
each other's side.

1269
02:01:41,323 --> 02:01:44,759
Wyatt Earp died
in Los Angeles in 1929.

1270
02:01:44,827 --> 02:01:46,112
Among the pallbearers
at his funeral...

1271
02:01:46,112 --> 02:01:47,670
Among the pallbearers
at his funeral...

1272
02:01:47,746 --> 02:01:51,876
were early Western movie stars
William S. Hart and Tom Mix.

1273
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:54,919
Tom Mix wept.
