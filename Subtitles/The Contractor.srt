00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,051
Easy, baby.

3
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,532
Hi, James.

4
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,791
Ali Mahmoud Jahar.

5
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,961
Remember him?

6
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,188
Course you do.

7
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,233
Wake up.

8
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,160
Don't.

9
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,742
Back.

10
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,216
So, they finally got him.

11
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,174
Took a year to put
this thing into place.

12
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,926
He's in prison in London.

13
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,602
He's my gift.
I'm giving him to you.

14
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,637
Wet work, Jimmy.

15
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,273
Right now he's in solitary,
but in 48 hours...

16
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:06,062
British intelligence is gonna be
sweating him and that's why I'm here.

17
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,403
I heard you moved up.

18
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,533
Keeping your distance
from this stuff?

19
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,957
Since his unfortunate escape...

20
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,590
there have been three bombings
attributed to his cell.

21
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,501
Belgrade subway,
Pakistani tour bus...

22
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,762
and those army barracks in Iraq.

23
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,141
That's 200 deaths...

24
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,472
you and I know could
have been prevented.

25
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,138
You wanna see him run his
operation from prison?

26
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,274
Not to mention the political
ramifications when it's discovered...

27
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,061
we sponsored his training in Saudi.

28
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,776
We need you to eliminate him
and we need you to get out.

29
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,532
I've got two passports for you,
one to enter, one to leave.

30
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,285
Your liaison in London is Terry
Winchell. He's a good guy.

31
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,071
Used him before.

32
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,660
Moscow Rules, of course.

33
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,326
Every second counts, no mistakes.

34
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,955
I know what it means.

35
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,089
Same old shit.

36
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:22,938
<i>Flight 679 now
boarding from Gate 3.</i>

37
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,981
<i>Would passenger David
Alan Raynor...</i>

38
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:34,275
<i>traveling to Luxor please proceed
immediately to Departure Gate 59.</i>

39
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,738
Hey.

40
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,949
- Winchell?
- That's me.

41
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,159
And you, it's a true
honor to meet you, sir.

42
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,950
The stories I've heard
about you over the years.

43
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,539
- All right, let me take that.
- Which way?

44
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,955
Which way? Well, this way.

45
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,921
Did you have a good flight?

46
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,505
Well, welcome to London.

47
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,669
Excuse me, miss.

48
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,214
Sorry about the weather.

49
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,786
Halt.

50
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,172
Okay, you're the boss.

51
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,599
Okay.

52
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,475
Look, I'll need these
things before I leave.

53
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,639
Easy-peasy.

54
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,321
Oh, where's the safe house
just in case we get separated?

55
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,152
Elephant & Castle.

56
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,989
1212 Statton Road.

57
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,996
Easy to remember. Always use it.

58
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,782
The name "Whitney"
on the flat door.

59
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,370
And if you need anything else...

60
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,501
Beloit Printing's the place to go.

61
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,162
Now, he's a mate. Nice guy.

62
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,838
It's gonna be chaotic real quick.

63
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,100
Two seconds, and any longer
then we're both dead.

64
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,763
- Hello?
<i>- Has our friend arrived yet?</i>

65
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,265
Yeah, yeah, we're ready.

66
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,135
He's good. No trouble whatsoever.

67
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,679
<i>- Any time.</i>
- Of course, sir. Yeah, yeah, sure.

68
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,392
<i>- Any time.</i>
- Brilliant.

69
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,182
<i>- Good luck.</i>
- Cheers.

70
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,893
Who was that?

71
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,359
That was our dark lord and master.

72
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,741
You just recorded Collins?

73
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,276
Take it easy, all right.

74
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,910
It's just a precaution.

75
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,286
It's a new world out there.

76
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,664
- Paranoia.
- Insurance.

77
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,622
I've got loads of these recordings
back at the safe house.

78
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:16,163
You can have a listen to them
later on if you fancy a laugh.

79
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,881
Okay, we're on.

80
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,341
Look lively.

81
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,311
<i>It's like a feeding frenzy here.</i>

82
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,861
<i>Okay, look lively. I gotta go.</i>

83
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,205
<i>Okay. It's on. It's on.</i>

84
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,633
<i>He's coming through. He's
gonna stop. He's gonna stop.</i>

85
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,723
<i>I'm gonna get him closer.</i>

86
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,226
It's up to you now.
Here we go. Here we go.

87
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,062
<i>Here we go. Ten seconds.</i>

88
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,103
<i>Stand by.</i>

89
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,109
<i>Okay, five seconds.</i>

90
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,566
<i>Three seconds. Oh, no,
he's covered. He's covered!</i>

91
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,730
<i>He's got cover on him.
He's got cover on him!</i>

92
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,744
Other way, other way.
Headed north.

93
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,074
<i>Go. Take the shot, now.</i>

94
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,580
<i>What you waiting for? He's in.</i>

95
00:10:55,738 --> 00:11:00,585
<i>Here's your chance. He's there.
Just shoot now. Now, now!</i>

96
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,040
Through here.

97
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,587
Right. Quick as you can.

98
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,750
Keep moving.

99
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,215
He's gone, he's gone.
We've lost him.

100
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,600
<i>I'm gone. I'm out of here.</i>

101
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,260
<i>It's all fucked.</i>

102
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,649
Where is my lawyer?

103
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,455
Terry, get the car.

104
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,169
<i>It's fucked. It's all fucked.</i>

105
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,882
Terry, get the car.

106
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,964
Everything's arranged.

107
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,804
Don't worry, we'll have you
out of here in no time.

108
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,322
- Hey, hold it a sec.
- Hey.

109
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,737
- ID, please.
- All right.

110
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,995
Please, sir. Your ID.

111
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,119
Look at me, look at me.
Take your glasses off.

112
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,747
Do you hear me?
I said, take them off.

113
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,257
All right.

114
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,010
Right, you check the pews,
I'll take the bell tower.

115
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,392
- Okay, sir, on your way.
- Great. Smile.

116
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,854
Damn it, Terry.

117
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,042
Sorry, mate, I just...

118
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,874
- Just drive.
- Okay.

119
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,179
Great. Brace yourself.

120
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,728
<i>Suspects are heading
north in a black cab.</i>

121
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,563
Hold on to your pants.

122
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,485
<i>Secure the perimeter.</i>

123
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,198
<i>I repeat, secure the perimeter.</i>

124
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,249
Great!

125
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,794
Yes.

126
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,177
Superintendent, sir.

127
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,259
Morning.

128
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,390
Where's Inspector Ballard?

129
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,052
She's down at the tube station, sir.

130
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,117
<i>The next stop, Elephant & Castle.</i>

131
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,876
<i>Elephant & Castle, next stop.</i>

132
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,787
<i>Change, please. Change.</i>

133
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,391
Surveillance footage arrived yet?

134
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,275
Cramston.

135
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,812
- Inspector.
- Can you bring the stills?

136
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,275
Right away.

137
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,071
Let's not make a big
deal of this, Dad.

138
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,281
Of course not.

139
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,619
Just make sure you phone Mum
about tea on Sunday, will you?

140
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,763
...speak about it again. I want it
done yesterday, understand?

141
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,761
Hello, Mr. Whitney.

142
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,552
Lovely weather for a change.

143
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,409
Oh, sir.

144
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,821
The driver of the cab was
also at the courthouse.

145
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,285
Posing as a journalist, we assume.

146
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,664
There was also a
passenger in the cab.

147
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,251
We might be able to get a clear
image from those, but I'm not sure.

148
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,006
Definitely two suspects then?

149
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,292
Only one accounted for.

150
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,629
Kitty. Bingo?

151
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,047
Bingo?

152
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,048
Kitty, Kitty.

153
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,689
I'm looking for my cat.

154
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,726
She's white with two brown feet.

155
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,569
Who are you anyway?

156
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,533
I'm a friend of Mr. Whitney.

157
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,236
I like Mr. Whitney.

158
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,306
How'd you hurt yourself?

159
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,185
Let me see it.

160
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,601
It looks really serious.
You need to get it looked after.

161
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,145
No, I'm fine.

162
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,238
I'm fine.

163
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,002
You need me to help you.

164
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,505
Hey.

165
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,097
If I see your cat, I'll...

166
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,762
I'll keep it for you.

167
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,771
Don't bother.

168
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,024
I don't really have a cat.

169
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,490
Oh, shit.

170
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,991
Thank you.

171
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,622
Jeremy Collins.

172
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,705
Andrew Windsor. How do you do?

173
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,214
This assassin is obviously very
dangerous, as you can see...

174
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,970
which is why there's an
international manhunt.

175
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:42,010
Now, Mr. Collins, is to be given all
cooperation during your investigation.

176
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,975
I really appreciate all
your help, superintendent.

177
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,514
My entire department would.

178
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,988
Well, I'm here to, carry out any
orders that Mr. Collins may have...

179
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,194
thus making them, as it were,
English orders.

180
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,319
Thank you very much.

181
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:04,866
Exactly what does that mean,
sir, if you don't mind my asking?

182
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,411
You tell me the word that you didn't
understand and I'll try and couch it...

183
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,079
in simpler terms.

184
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,749
You see, I have 38 police personnel...

185
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,839
and four specialist units
working on this inquiry.

186
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,925
Am I to notify each one
of them about Mr. Collins?

187
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,466
No. I'd rather you didn't,
if that's all right.

188
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,101
It's a highly sensitive case
we're working on here.

189
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,103
Which department did
you say you work for?

190
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,063
- The Justice Department.
- Justice Department?

191
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,770
U.S. Justice Department.

192
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,776
My main concern is to
identify the shooter.

193
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,779
My government has instructed
me to take him into custody.

194
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,361
Thing is, Mr. Collins, if...

195
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:42,119
When we find him, we will question
him before anybody else does.

196
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,575
It's under my jurisdiction.

197
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,241
Well, see now, this is where
we're not really communicating.

198
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,412
When the shooter is found,
with all due respect...

199
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:54,924
your department is under orders to
call my department immediately.

200
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,801
Well, I thought I'd made
that abundantly clear.

201
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,302
Well I'm sure we'll
work something out.

202
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,848
- Friendly cooperation.
- Yeah.

203
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,732
Right, well, since we're now
all very good friends...

204
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,190
are there any questions
that you need answering?

205
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,730
Sure, I see you released a photo
of the driver to the media.

206
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,320
You have any shots of
the second suspect?

207
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,483
One.

208
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,202
We're working on it. Within the next
few days we'll have it cleaned up.

209
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,243
Okay. I need to see
all CCTV footage.

210
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,878
Right.

211
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,254
Immediately.

212
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,087
Right.

213
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,252
Okay.

214
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,053
I brought you a sandwich.

215
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,968
And cupcakes.

216
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,035
What...? What's your name?

217
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,917
Emily.

218
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,794
Emily Day.

219
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,216
I heard you talking to someone
out there. Who was it?

220
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,174
That's just Gramms.
She's all right.

221
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,338
Just a bit wonky,
if you know what I mean.

222
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,178
And your parents?

223
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,972
Peace Corps hippies.

224
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,567
They're in South
America now, I think.

225
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,981
Touring the country.

226
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,445
But they'll be home by Christmas.

227
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,753
I'll get you some bandages.

228
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,186
<i>Scotland Yard have just
received further information...</i>

229
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:16,565
<i>concerning the dead man in today's
tragic crash in central London.</i>

230
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,102
<i>Police have positively
identified the victim...</i>

231
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,236
<i>as Terry Mitchell.</i>

232
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,397
<i>Mitchell is believed to
have been involved...</i>

233
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,067
<i>with today's assassination
of alleged terrorist...</i>

234
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,531
<i>Ali Mahmoud Jahar.</i>

235
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,368
<i>Mitchell's accomplice
is still at large.</i>

236
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,579
<i>The police are appealing for anyone
who may have been in the area...</i>

237
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,244
- Mr. Whitney.
<i>- ...to come forward.</i>

238
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:39,913
Gramms.

239
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,712
Where you running off to?

240
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,177
- You all right?
- Yeah.

241
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,962
Mrs. Jenkins down the block called.

242
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,757
Asked if I could read
Jane Eyre to her.

243
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,515
<i>Jane Eyre,</i> is it?

244
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,150
I told my gramms I was
gonna read <i>Jane Eyre...</i>

245
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,319
to this weird lady down the row.

246
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,913
What if she finds out you're not?

247
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,996
She won't. I lie all the time.

248
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,750
I got her incredibly confused
once, poor old thing.

249
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,462
Anyway, the thing is
about Mr. Whitney...

250
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,849
He was really kind to me.

251
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,938
How's your cut, by the way?

252
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,195
Look, I need some rest.

253
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,080
I'm glad you're here.

254
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,585
Whoever you are.

255
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,529
<i>Wet work, Jimmy.</i>

256
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,280
<i>He's my gift.</i>

257
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,615
<i>Wet work, Jimmy.</i>

258
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,775
<i>He's my gift.</i>

259
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,068
<i>I'm glad you're here.</i>

260
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,737
<i>Gift. I'm giving him to you.</i>

261
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,406
<i>I'm glad you're here.</i>

262
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,949
<i>You need me to help you.</i>

263
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,367
You need me to help.

264
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,337
<i>It's just a precaution.</i>

265
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,497
<i>Moscow Rules.</i>

266
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,166
<i>It's just a precaution.</i>

267
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,411
No more of that terrible music
so early in the morning, please.

268
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,160
You're wicked. I'm off. You better
go, you'll be late for school.

269
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,261
Forensics came up
with this, inspector.

270
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,924
They took apart the cab and they
found under the floorboards...

271
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,685
is the corner of a takeout
menu from a curry house.

272
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,844
Can we ID it?

273
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,264
We traced the logo to a
restaurant in South London.

274
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,307
Elephant & Castle.

275
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,983
It's worth looking into.

276
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,233
Take the photo of the
suspect with you.

277
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,023
Right away.

278
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,125
What?

279
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,463
Nothing.

280
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,558
- What?
- Let me in.

281
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,022
No. Go away.

282
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,526
I brought you some coffee.

283
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,081
If you want some coffee,
I can go and get you some.

284
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,330
Why aren't you in school?

285
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,124
If you must know, I'm skipping.

286
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,085
I can't be bothered.

287
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,925
I brought you something
you'll want.

288
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,714
What is it?

289
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,054
- Guess.
- I can't guess. Just tell me.

290
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,763
- Just guess.
- I don't know.

291
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,554
Hell, I just... Just tell me.

292
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,847
It's something you need.

293
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,184
Some desert boots...

294
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,694
a frying pan...

295
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,854
a Dust Devil, a...

296
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,944
I don't know, a butt-naked
lady with some...

297
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,949
six toes and a thing for chocolate.

298
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,032
- What? I don't know.
- Toothbrush.

299
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,125
It's been sent to every
airport, border and port.

300
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,877
They've all been alerted.

301
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,967
Keep it away from
the media for now.

302
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,127
Understood.

303
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,296
What about the American? Collins.

304
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:25,013
Don't tell that
bastard anything yet.

305
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,273
Sir?

306
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:35,110
Agent 52-57 calling from the field.

307
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,029
James.

308
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,208
Terry's dead.

309
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,085
<i>Yeah, he fucked up, didn't he?</i>

310
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,417
You're all over the news, buddy.

311
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,332
<i>Where are you?</i>

312
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,094
<i>James?</i>

313
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,263
I'll bring you in.

314
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,969
<i>James?</i>

315
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,181
Dance is over.

316
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,941
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

317
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,194
<i>Give me 40 minutes,
James, and I'll...</i>

318
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,698
He's getting out?

319
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,256
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

320
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:42,716
<i>Passengers are reminded
that for security reasons...</i>

321
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:46,883
<i>baggage must not be left
unattended at any time.</i>

322
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,550
Have a safe flight, Mr. Murphy.

323
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,860
Ballard.

324
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,398
No, no, no, don't do anything.

325
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,073
Next one, please.

326
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,997
Excuse me, sir.

327
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,124
Step to one side.

328
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,035
Thank you.

329
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,175
Under the jacket here, sir.

330
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,596
Right, I need you to
do that again, sir.

331
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,768
Take your belt off.
And your shoes, please.

332
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,442
Thank you.

333
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,789
Right, sir, thank you very much.

334
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,217
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

335
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,058
Could you page
John Murphy, please?

336
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,642
Sure.

337
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,324
<i>This is a call for John Murphy.</i>

338
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,164
<i>Can John Murphy pick up the
white courtesy telephone?</i>

339
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,327
<i>Thank you.</i>

340
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,122
<i>This is a call for John Murphy.</i>

341
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:46,590
<i>Can John Murphy please pick up
the white courtesy telephone?</i>

342
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,253
<i>Thank you.</i>

343
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,216
I've been informed we have to
let the Americans run point.

344
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,501
Bollocks.

345
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,215
I'll check with airport security.

346
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,800
Very good. Where's the suspect?

347
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,806
I've been told we shouldn't interfere.

348
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,387
Don't piss about. Where is he?

349
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,552
- Baggage area, sir.
- Thank you.

350
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,889
Wait. Hold up.

351
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,899
Where you going? Come back.

352
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,373
Freeze.

353
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,228
King?

354
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,437
You Okay?

355
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,447
Yeah. You go on.

356
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,450
Dial.

357
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,124
Come on, Dial.

358
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,588
Hiding again?

359
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,080
That's far enough.

360
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,090
Don't you move a muscle.

361
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,587
Chief Superintendent Andrew
Windsor, Metropolitan Police.

362
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,428
Now this whole area is
swarming with armed coppers...

363
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,889
so I suggest you
start talking to me.

364
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,357
My name is James Jackson Dial.

365
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,819
Agent 52-77.

366
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,525
I was trained in Quantico.

367
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,114
Target elimination.

368
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,995
Under the covert black ops unit.

369
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,740
Firezone.

370
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,040
My case officer is Jeremy Collins.

371
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,214
You say Collins?

372
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,665
What's going on in there?
Why are those cameras off?

373
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,136
Turning on the lights now.

374
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,932
Zooming in.

375
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,105
Inspector, better come
and look at this.

376
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,775
What do you wanna do?

377
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,657
Inspector?

378
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,624
Annette.

379
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,836
We checked out that lead
in Elephant & Castle.

380
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,749
The owner of the restaurant ID'd
the suspect's photograph...

381
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,884
as someone who lived in the area.

382
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:23,263
Went by the name of Mr. Whitney.

383
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,474
No one tells the American.

384
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,216
Great.

385
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,153
Where have you been?

386
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,410
A costume party.

387
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,075
Don't lie to a liar.

388
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,999
Well, you've messed up the place.

389
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,125
Looking for something, are you?

390
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,673
Yep.

391
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,221
But it's not here.

392
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:54,804
Mister.

393
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,395
You have to take a look at this.

394
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,737
Easy, for fuck's sake.

395
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,164
Come on.

396
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,079
Quickly.

397
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,960
Where does this go?

398
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,004
The flat is secure.

399
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,881
He was there,
but not anymore. Gone.

400
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,509
Well, continue searching
every flat in this building.

401
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,169
Okay.

402
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,981
Quiet.

403
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,483
Police, madam.
We need to search your...

404
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,027
- Where are you...?
- Go, go.

405
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,040
Stand down.

406
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,924
- Get her out.
- Okay, sweetheart.

407
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,085
Go wait with the lady
in the living room.

408
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,842
Get out.

409
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:38,551
Clear, sergeant.

410
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,220
Clear.

411
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,680
<i>All clear.</i>

412
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:01,949
Ballard?

413
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,618
I want a picture of the bastard...

414
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:07,334
on every television in
the country by morning.

415
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,291
Oh, I thought they caught you.

416
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,972
They're gone.

417
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,446
Come on, I gotta hide you.

418
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,758
Just got off the phone
from Washington, sir.

419
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:30,315
You've been called to testify before the
Congressional Intelligence Committee.

420
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,185
The hearings have started.

421
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,272
When?

422
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,194
Three days.

423
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,860
We need to get him before they do.

424
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,414
Then that's how long we've got.

425
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:32,744
Mister?

426
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,879
You've gotta see this.

427
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,341
<i>This morning, Scotland Yard
released this photograph...</i>

428
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,800
<i>of the man suspected to be involved
with the Ali Jahar assassination...</i>

429
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,886
<i>and the murder of Chief
Superintendent Andrew Windsor.</i>

430
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,014
<i>The public are reminded
that the suspect is armed...</i>

431
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,519
<i>and extremely dangerous.</i>

432
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,601
<i>If recognized, he should
not be approached...</i>

433
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,267
<i>under any circumstances.</i>

434
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,444
I didn't shoot the cop.

435
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,859
I believe you.

436
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,651
You can't lie to a liar
so I'd know if you were.

437
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,411
Yeah, I bet you would.

438
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,288
What are you gonna do?

439
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,871
I'm gonna try to find a way out.

440
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,914
- That's nice. I like it.
- Thank you, ma'am.

441
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,457
Can I order more?

442
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,006
Yeah, of course.

443
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,421
- Like 200?
- Sure.

444
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,095
And they'll be ready till Monday?

445
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,434
Yes, ma'am, just for you.

446
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,686
Thank you, Mr. Beloit.

447
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,308
All right, come on.

448
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,444
Sir, may I help you?

449
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,744
Yes. The way you helped my friends.

450
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,375
And friends like him.

451
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,547
I'm sorry?

452
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,629
Terry Winchell.

453
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,633
I need a passport.

454
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,303
The Passport Office
issues passports.

455
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:55,060
I'm printing invitations,
announcements, letterheads...

456
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,311
Half now...

457
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,309
half when the job is done.

458
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,491
Be all you can be.

459
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:22,497
Tomorrow afternoon.

460
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,256
Three p.m.

461
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,551
It's too late.

462
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,008
I need it today.

463
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,761
Not possible.

464
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:39,809
Anything is possible.

465
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,946
<i>Pressure increases on the
government over the issue...</i>

466
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,075
<i>of grace-and-favor homes for
ministers as the Opposition vows...</i>

467
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,201
<i>to scrap them if elected. Martin.</i>

468
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,658
<i>Thank you, Cindy.
Just in from the newsroom:</i>

469
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,370
<i>No arrests made yet in
connection with the shooting...</i>

470
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,205
<i>of Chief Inspector
Andrew Windsor...</i>

471
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,086
<i>but Scotland Yard are offering
a 20,000-pound reward...</i>

472
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,839
<i>for information leading
to the arrest of this man.</i>

473
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,350
Is this gonna be too hard for you?

474
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,054
- I'll be all right.
- I figured as much.

475
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,854
Ballard.

476
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,732
Who the hell's Beloit?

477
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,070
My dad wore that coat
to work every Monday.

478
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,364
"Make a good impression,"
he used to say.

479
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,117
He wore it, huh?

480
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,503
You mean when he wasn't
traveling the world?

481
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,211
Yeah.

482
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,010
Well, before he left.

483
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,933
I saw the obituary, Emily.

484
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,373
You know, back home
in the mountains...

485
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,418
I have this horse.

486
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,797
Stubborn thing.

487
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,754
Won't be broken.

488
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,634
I think you'd like it.

489
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:41,935
What's his name?

490
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:45,227
I call him "Beauty."

491
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,108
Original.

492
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,861
You should see him.

493
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:59,446
I tell you, this horse has a spirit
like no other I've ever seen.

494
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,455
Well, maybe I'll come
and see him someday.

495
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,836
Maybe.

496
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,011
You Okay?

497
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,257
Yeah.

498
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,509
It's time.

499
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,356
Okay. Mister, listen to me.

500
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,524
I'm gonna go ahead of
you and check the shop.

501
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,194
- What?
- To make sure it's not a setup...

502
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,533
you know, like you see
on the detective shows.

503
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,448
- No.
- Why not?

504
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,868
- No.
- I'm just a girl walking into a shop.

505
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:49,628
- No.
- Why not? Stop!

506
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,081
When I come out...

507
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,000
if I walk away from you,
everything's fine.

508
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,010
But if I walk towards you...

509
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,718
it means there's cops in there.

510
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,015
Emily, Emily, Emily.

511
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:04,393
If I walk towards you...

512
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,686
just run.

513
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:19,737
He's a wild boy.
Wild boy. He's a rude boy.

514
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:52,566
Mr. Beloit, this whole
thing is gonna be fine.

515
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,935
Trust me.

516
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:57,772
I'm getting married, not you.

517
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,732
- Right?
- Are you a hundred percent sure?

518
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,776
I'm absolutely sure.

519
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,945
Just have to change the date.

520
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,281
Can I help you, young lady?

521
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,495
I need something photocopied.

522
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:12,832
This is a printers. We don't have
copy machines, I'm sorry.

523
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,796
Right. Well, thanks, then.

524
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:40,985
<i>A1 in position. Fifth floor.</i>

525
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,577
<i>Target in sight.</i>

526
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,413
<i>I repeat, target in sight.</i>

527
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,162
<i>One hundred yards downrange.</i>

528
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,630
<i>Target's approaching,
wearing a brown hoodie.</i>

529
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,714
<i>Target's approaching.
Thirty seconds.</i>

530
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,308
<i>Do we have permission to fire?</i>

531
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,559
<i>A1 in position.</i>

532
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,529
<i>Target heading towards
the printer's.</i>

533
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,907
King, ID.

534
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,910
<i>Repeat, do we have
permission to fire?</i>

535
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,585
<i>Clear shot available.</i>

536
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,928
- Twenty seconds.
- What the hell is this?

537
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,185
This operation has
not been authorized.

538
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,273
<i>Clear shot.</i>

539
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,193
I have reliable information...

540
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,945
- Sir, our task...
- Get the fuck out of my face!

541
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,606
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

542
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:52,280
- Stand your men down, Ballard!
- Absolutely not!

543
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,790
<i>The target's moving away.
The target's moving away.</i>

544
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:55,949
Go, go! go.

545
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:05,797
<i>Target now moving north
towards the market.</i>

546
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,050
Dial!

547
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,470
<i>He's taking a left, left,
left into Kendall Road.</i>

548
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:25,396
<i>Target moving down Kendall Road...</i>

549
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,779
<i>near the car park.</i>

550
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:32,494
<i>Target taking a right, right, right
into Christchurch Street.</i>

551
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,246
Do not fire. I repeat, do not fire.

552
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,406
<i>Stay in position, A2.</i>

553
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,335
<i>Do not shoot. Repeat, do not shoot.</i>

554
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,137
<i>I've lost sight of the target.
I've lost complete sight of the target.</i>

555
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,524
Get off me!

556
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,666
Yeah. He got away.

557
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,082
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

558
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,420
Mr. Collins.

559
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:18,050
I know why I want this shooter.

560
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,514
But what I can't figure
out is why do you?

561
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,435
National security of the
United States of America.

562
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,802
Have we got that footage
back from the lab?

563
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:58,465
- Not yet, but...
- Tell me someone's bloody trying.

564
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,634
Of course they are.

565
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:05,222
- Just keep me informed, all right?
- Certainly, inspector.

566
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,156
There you are.

567
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:26,577
- I was worried to death.
- Sorry, Gramms.

568
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,837
I need you to sit
down with me, Emmie.

569
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:34,294
- I don't feel much like it.
- Now, if you please.

570
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,857
I know we've had our
differences, you and I.

571
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,281
It's not you, Gramms.

572
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,659
No, I mean really. I...

573
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:03,326
Your being here, I know
how unnatural it is.

574
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:09,043
And any mothering instinct
I once had has obviously faded.

575
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:12,957
You do all right. Honestly.

576
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:22,721
Honesty's not something
you're very familiar with.

577
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,610
I miss them too, Emmie.

578
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:03,215
We will try and make the best of it,
you and I, won't we, Em?

579
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,348
That's good.

580
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,781
- I thought you were dead.
- Yeah.

581
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:28,369
- They were waiting there.
- Yes.

582
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,620
The whole world is looking for you.

583
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:46,800
Things are becoming
more complicated.

584
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,968
Oh, you can say that again.

585
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,973
I'm gonna have to turn myself in.

586
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,778
But you'll go to prison then.

587
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,694
Maybe.

588
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:10,411
- What will happen to Beauty?
- Beauty?

589
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,336
Beauty will be just fine.

590
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:21,008
I wanna go to your ranch.
You'll teach me how to ride.

591
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,886
I'd only come for a visit,
and I wouldn't be a bother.

592
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,968
- I promise.
- Just, just, just stop.

593
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:34,765
<i>I'm going to sleep now.</i>

594
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,601
<i>I'm going to sleep now.</i>

595
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:41,446
How long have you
had that computer?

596
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,194
It was a present.

597
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,864
From your neighbor, Mr. Whitney.

598
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:50,622
- How did you know that?
- Lucky guess.

599
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,997
<i>I'm going to sleep now.</i>

600
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,040
<i>It's really not going very well.</i>

601
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,042
Two more days until
the hearing, sir.

602
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,215
Yeah, you know what? Fuck them.

603
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,423
Fuck all of them.

604
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,053
People like us, Purcell...

605
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:16,185
we're just the soldiers on
the covert battlefield.

606
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,850
I know you know that.

607
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,529
Fight fire with fire, sir.

608
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:26,237
We should be heroes.
Me, you, James.

609
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,072
It's embarrassing.

610
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:31,906
We have to hide and
cower like criminals...

611
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,166
when the whole world is
falling apart at the seams.

612
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,253
But we've got every phone
in Scotland Yard tapped.

613
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:55,020
And he's gonna be
calling in real soon.

614
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,931
How do you know?

615
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,314
That's what I'd do.

616
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,991
What's all this about then?

617
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,453
Leverage.

618
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,955
Inspector, that was a really
lovely service for your father.

619
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,249
- Thank you.
- You holding up?

620
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,469
At the end of the day, Cramston, I...

621
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:29,971
I don't know.

622
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:36,853
- You don't have to.
- Excuse me.

623
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:38,851
- Yes?
<i>- Inspector Ballard?</i>

624
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:41,516
<i>- We've an urgent call for you.</i>
- Put them through.

625
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,731
<i>Sorry to disturb you.</i>

626
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:45,774
Ballard speaking.

627
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:49,566
<i>You're looking for me.</i>

628
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:50,984
I'm sorry?

629
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,653
<i>You've been looking for me.</i>

630
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,163
Of course.

631
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:02,166
Things aren't the way
they appear to be.

632
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:05,999
In what way?

633
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:11,755
I'm a...

634
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,807
I'm an operative for the Agency.

635
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:19,396
<i>My case officer is the one
who ordered the hit on Jahar.</i>

636
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,103
<i>His name is Jeremy Collins.</i>

637
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,854
<i>I didn't shoot your father.</i>

638
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,360
Really?

639
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,702
I have more proof.

640
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,291
Meet me.

641
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,795
- Where?
<i>- Corner of Harrington Street.</i>

642
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:48,625
- There's a new mall.
- I know it.

643
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,759
<i>In one hour.</i>

644
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:52,841
<i>And, Ballard...</i>

645
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:55,890
no cops.

646
01:08:56,883 --> 01:09:00,808
<i>If there are any cops
there, I disappear.</i>

647
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,559
For good.

648
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,021
Yeah, I understand.

649
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,435
Ready, sir.

650
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,422
Emmie?

651
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:17,805
Hi, Gramms.

652
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,638
Mr. Brown was sick, so I got
the rest of the day off school.

653
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:22,810
What's all this then?

654
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:26,140
Made you coffee. Oh, and I've got
a load of laundry in the wash.

655
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:27,852
Are you possessed, child?

656
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,733
I know you have your
book club today...

657
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,315
so I heated you up a
sausage roll for the tube.

658
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,653
Have you done something terrible...

659
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,318
like burn down the
school or something?

660
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:40,828
Of course not. Now,
come on, we're gonna be late.

661
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,992
Emily.

662
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,896
So we take this road to
the new shopping mall.

663
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:09,728
And then the train station's
just a block away.

664
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,643
You have to take the 4:00 to Dover.

665
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,403
And then the ships go
in and out all the time.

666
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:17,023
You know, you're a
little too good at this.

667
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,693
Take this road to
the new mall here.

668
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,533
<i>And then the train station's
only a block away.</i>

669
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:26,283
<i>You need to avoid the high streets,
there's too many people there.</i>

670
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,753
Do you know where this is?

671
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,042
Over there.

672
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:38,507
<i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

673
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,630
<i>If you don't hear
from me in an hour...</i>

674
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,640
<i>take your laptop to
the police station.</i>

675
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:45,552
<i>You ask for Inspector Ballard.</i>

676
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:48,141
- Inspector Ballard. You got that?
- Yeah.

677
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,353
<i>And then you play for her
the MP3s that I copied.</i>

678
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:56,946
Okay.

679
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,195
All right.

680
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:07,573
Hey.

681
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:11,999
I still don't know your name.

682
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,422
James.

683
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:09,389
You said you had proof.

684
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,724
Take it easy.

685
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:25,994
- What's that?
- Years of hits ordered by the Agency.

686
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:27,995
Ordered by Collins.

687
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,120
I need you to come
with me, Mr. Dial.

688
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:39,336
Stop running.

689
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,003
You have everything you need.

690
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,807
I don't think so.

691
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:01,521
Stop right there.

692
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,095
- Which way?
- This way.

693
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,933
Wait. I want my gun.

694
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,445
Dial!

695
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,239
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

696
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:37,830
It just grazed me.

697
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:41,166
Go right. Go right!

698
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,661
Dial?

699
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,311
Over here!

700
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:51,319
Purcell? Purcell!

701
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,860
Purcell! Come on.

702
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,001
Is this what you do?

703
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,672
Let's go.

704
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:20,140
Purcell?

705
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,581
Purcell, we're here.

706
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:48,422
Keep going. Try to find
a way out. I'll stay here.

707
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,046
- No.
- Go.

708
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,261
Go!

709
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,774
- Over here.
- Purcell.

710
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,596
Purcell.

711
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:49,317
God. He's dead.

712
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:57,858
Purcell's dead.

713
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:53,399
Cramston, I hope you're bloody
well ready for this, mate.

714
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:56,022
Just look at that.

715
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,654
Fuck me.

716
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:08,535
I need you to print out
an image of this man.

717
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,015
Just spotted them.

718
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:15,180
Headed into the Brisbane Hotel.

719
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:20,462
- You all better get out of here!
- Run! Come on.

720
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,611
Move! Go. Go. Go.

721
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,693
- Get out of here!
- Go. Go.

722
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:01,211
Seems like we're trapped, James.

723
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:04,214
Just like Croatia. Remember that?

724
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:10,921
Escape seemed impossible.

725
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:36,826
If the mission fails,
you're already dead.

726
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:39,492
- Moscow Rules.
- Not this time.

727
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,339
Hey.

728
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,842
Hey.

729
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,764
Well, you know...

730
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,268
this thing here...

731
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:26,015
it... It was never personal, man.

732
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,694
Yeah.

733
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:34,440
I know.

734
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:15,530
You need to see this.
It was Collins who...

735
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:16,986
I know.

736
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:20,657
I know.

737
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,789
Get this looked at.

738
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:37,733
After all we went through, you've
gone and hurt yourself again.

739
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:40,900
Yeah, I got a nasty habit
of running into bullets.

740
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,492
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

741
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:51,831
I've packed everything.

742
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:55,247
Emily, you can't.

743
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:58,209
You can't go where I'm going.

744
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:00,510
You belong here.

745
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,512
This is where you're from.

746
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,756
Please.

747
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:09,264
I promise I'll...

748
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:17,277
I'll see you again.

749
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,664
Look, Emily, I gotta go.

750
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:39,400
- Do you know where he's going?
- No, I don't.

751
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:41,653
Do...? Do you know him?

752
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:45,232
He saved my life.

753
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:49,277
He's my friend.

754
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:03,500
Hey.

755
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:21,067
No, I... No, I wanna come.
On Saturday, yeah?

756
01:31:23,687 --> 01:31:26,065
Well, I'll tell Sarah. I...
I think I can come.

757
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:28,029
- Emmie.
- I gotta go.

758
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:30,319
Got a letter today.

759
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:33,284
- From who?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

760
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:35,824
America, I think.

761
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:53,012
<i>Dear Emily...</i>

762
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:56,474
<i>I was thinking of
setting Beauty free.</i>

763
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,934
<i>Thought you might wanna help.</i>

764
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:00,894
<i>I've sent two tickets...</i>

765
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:04,937
<i>one for you and one
for your grandma.</i>

766
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:07,109
<i>Hope to see you.</i>

767
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,524
<i>We'll be waiting.</i>

767
01:32:10,305 --> 01:33:10,354
