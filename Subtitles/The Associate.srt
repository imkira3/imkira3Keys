2
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,790
Very impressive. Nice work, Walter.

3
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:08,836
It was Frank and Laurel's show.
I'm here to make you feel important.

4
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:12,590
Don't listen to him, Carl.
Everything coming from this company

5
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,220
- has his stamp. We do the grunt work.
- I didn't grunt once.

6
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,184
It's amazing, I'm making money
and I don't even understand

7
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,313
- what Fusionics does.
- It changes the way you use energy.

8
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,773
Is that so?

9
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,151
Reader's Digest
just ran an article on it.

10
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,532
What a kidder! Science Digest.

11
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,538
Look at the time.
We're going to be late for a meeting.

12
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,124
Keep up the good work, you two.

13
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,585
Quite a team.

14
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:55,133
Reader's Digest, Frank!
- Without your comment, they wouldn't have noticed.

15
00:02:55,551 --> 00:03:01,139
If you'd read the material I give you, we wouldn't have to worry.
- Laurel,

16
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,766
I have a life.

17
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,230
- I know something and I'm not telling.
- I can make you tell.

18
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,734
- You've got to be a whole lot nicer to me.
- Not really. See, watch.

19
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,280
That was nice.
All right, here it is.

20
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,741
CW is being moved up to senior VP.

21
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:24,662
Meaning the standard for VP
has dropped dramatically.

22
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:30,251
That too. Now there's
a VP spot opening. Who's next in line?

23
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,087
Who? - You know.
- Just say it.

24
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,299
You baby. You've got seniority

25
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,552
and, thanks to me, the most kills.
If we kill tonight,

26
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:44,348
you're in. Come on, we've got to go
in 2 minutes. Don't be late. Sally!

27
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:48,394
2 minutes. - Alright. Harry,
you've got those proposals for me?

28
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:53,983
Your promotion will get me more
respect in Xerox. - 2 minutes.

29
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,028
Oh wow! Tie emergency.

30
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:02,074
These clouds, this new age thing
is going to render people mute.

31
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,078
- Why did you pick it?
- It was a present from Carl Bode.

32
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,248
He wouldn't even notice.
Save me.

33
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,626
- Harry, those proposals.
- 30 seconds.

34
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,587
- Proposals.
- Thank you.

35
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,507
- And the magazine article?
- You doubt Harry?

36
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:23,262
Metals, depletions of resources,
soaring costs of mining.

37
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,765
The iron ore made me weep.

38
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,351
Okay, thanks Sweetie.

39
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,061
Sweetie.

40
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:35,775
- We're late. You're wearing that?
- Yes. What are you, Mr. Blackwell?

41
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,363
- I can't run home just to change.
- Never mind. It's dark there.

42
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,492
- Dark? In the Huntley Club?
- We're not going there.

43
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,955
- We're going some place much hipper.
- Fine, as long as it's quiet.

44
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,124
Don't worry, Mom.

45
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:06,597
You're just satisfying your need
for raw material. With ReCon Recycling

46
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:12,770
you'll cut that need 30 percent,
saving 13 million annually.

47
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,774
I say, 13 million annually.

48
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,860
- How does she do it?
- I'm in love.

49
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,280
Yeah, I want to have her baby.

50
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,158
What's the payback period?

51
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,122
- 16 months. Look on page 6.
- You need numbers?

52
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:36,043
This deal's approved by Frank Peterson
and you need numbers?

53
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,047
Holy shit, look at that!
Here you go.

54
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,680
What's this?

55
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,560
- I'm giving the clients what they want.
- You think Sandy wants this?

56
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,563
Trust me, it's nothing new.

57
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,398
See?

58
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,568
Another round here.

59
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,822
- Do you like her breasts?
- What?

60
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,199
I might have mine done.

61
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,661
- Why?
- Why not? It helps.

62
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:16,250
At an important meeting, show
some cleavage and see the difference.

63
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,421
Will you excuse me?

64
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,430
We need to talk.
- Now? - Now.

65
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,979
How can we do business here with them
throwing money at a naked lady?

66
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,566
This is business.
We're male-bonding like crazy.

67
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,110
It's time to go. Now.

68
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,782
Come on. You did your job,
and very well, I might add.

69
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,161
- Go home. It's a done deal.
- We haven't closed yet.

70
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,706
They're flying to Chicago tomorrow. - We'll do it on the phone.
- When?

71
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,211
- In the morning.
- Frank, I want to close this tonight.

72
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:05,383
Okay fine.
Go over there and tell them

73
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,219
it's time to go back to work.

74
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,012
- Fine.
- No.

75
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:15,226
Don't do that. Just go home.
You killed them. They loved you.

76
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,147
- I love you.
- You're drunk.

77
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,150
Go home. Celebrate with someone.

78
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,238
What's wrong?

79
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,412
Coming through.

80
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,164
Coming through. Coming through.

81
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,504
Morning, Sally. - Morning, Ms. Ayres.
- Frank in yet? - Since 8 o'clock.

82
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,591
- Am I late?
- I wouldn't say that, Ms. Ayres.

83
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,136
Where is he?

84
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,557
- At a staff meeting.
- A staff meeting?

85
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,017
The one Manchester called for 8:15

86
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:22,877
Anyway, they kept playing hard to get.
Typical dog and pony show.

87
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,005
They're concerned
about ReCon's debt and payback period.

88
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:30,217
Masters of the obvious.
I work them, I work them.

89
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,973
I hack away at their concern,
then at 3 in the morning, I close it.

90
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,350
Hell of a score, Frank.

91
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,061
- Well done.
- Of course,

92
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,357
- Laurel made it possible.
- Atta girl, Laurel.

93
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:50,863
Way to share the praise, Frank.
With a kill like this, all can profit.

94
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:58,537
- You told me to close my deal on the phone.
- Our deal.

95
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:03,417
They liked it so much that they wanted
to present it to the board right away.

96
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,046
This is a big win for us. For you.

97
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,591
For your promotion. You killed.

98
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,426
Manchester was eating it up.

99
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,888
What are we fighting about?
We should celebrate.

100
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,849
- What are you doing for lunch?
- Nothing.

101
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,601
Great.

102
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,397
Manchester asked us to buy
Anton Schuler's wedding gift.

103
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,191
We'll get it afterward.

104
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,198
Wait. Damn it! I already have a lunch.
It's too late to cancel.

105
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:40,162
What do I know about gifts?
Take Sally with you. She has taste.

106
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,707
Just send Sally and I can work.

107
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:48,254
- Sally can't use the company card.
- If you don't wish me to go...

108
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,299
Nonsense.
Women love shopping together.

109
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:59,056
Sally knows Manchester's tastes.
We all want him to be happy.

110
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,767
Right?

111
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,565
Thanks, Sweetie.

112
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:14,321
That's it. You go have lunch, I'll go to the office.
- I eat at the office.

113
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,865
Do you want to walk together?

114
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:21,203
We'll grab a cab. My treat.

115
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,040
Sorry, Ms. Ayres, I forgot my place.

116
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,168
- Get a cab. I'll walk.
- What?

117
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,506
I see how you look at me,
when you look at me.

118
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:37,636
- Like the ghost of Christmas past.
- Has Frank finally driven you nuts?

119
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,890
He's a jerk. I can deal with that.
But you treat me like a relic.

120
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:46,729
Me? - Like a secretary.
Like a career secretary.

121
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,897
I'm good at what I do.

122
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:53,485
The women's movement didn't make
it down to Wall Street.

123
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:58,157
- Affirmative action didn't help me.
- It wasn't supposed to.

124
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,952
And so you're clear,
I got here by talent and hard work.

125
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:07,124
Ms. Ayres, would you come with me?
I want to show you something.

126
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,128
It won't take long.
Just one minute. Let me show you.

127
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,512
So? He's at lunch with Manchester.

128
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,517
I could have had
lunch with Manchester.

129
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:31,148
Why wasn't I invited to that lunch?

130
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,443
So much for "time's changing.",

131
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,156
You!

132
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,451
I trained you and get promoted.

133
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,914
You got screwed.
But that shouldn't change things

134
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,333
between us. Look,

135
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,965
even though I'm your boss,
you should think of us as a team.

136
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,679
Should I move my desk?
The sun hits me all afternoon here.

137
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,180
What?

138
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,059
Sally!

139
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,397
I'm in a meeting!
How about some privacy?

140
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,444
I went to the mat for you.
Manchester had already decided.

141
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:22,533
So I should scream at Manchester? - He's flying to London.
- Convenient.

142
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,576
And confidentially,

143
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,246
he thinks
that women who get passed over

144
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,332
exhibit negative attitude.

145
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,962
Then why do the men who get
passed over turn up with an Uzi?

146
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:40,008
I'm your friend.
- You are not. Friends don't do this to each other.

147
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,844
You're a low-life,

148
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:47,975
brain-sucking pig that would sell
his mother up the river to get a deal.

149
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,144
A VP has to be a closer.

150
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,606
- How? I work and you take the credit.
- I hope you've got PMS.

151
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,401
Baby, if I did, you'd be dead.

152
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,905
- Can you handle the truth?
- Can you tell the truth?

153
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,950
You would never make VP.

154
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,952
It sucks, but that's how it is.

155
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,249
You're better off working for me.
I can protect you.

156
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:19,089
Frank, as my new boss,
let me tell you first: I quit.

157
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,176
It's cold out there.

158
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,373
- Hi gorgeous.
- Color you Barbara!

159
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,585
- It's the new me. Fabulous, hey?
- Like butter.

160
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:01,715
My Babes is making twice as many tips
as when I did Marilyn or Judy.

161
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,218
May they rest in peace. By the way,

162
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:10,057
your rent check for July and August.
I owe you for September and October.

163
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:14,019
It's November now. - You would have
to rain on my parade.

164
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,856
God, how the months mount up.
But Barbara never ages.

165
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,861
Well, girlfriend, I'm late for the
midnight show. 'Night, Mrs. Cupchick.

166
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:28,408
- Goodnight, Barbara.
- Just talk amongst yourselves, girls.

167
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,160
You're home late.

168
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:35,207
- I had a great day, so don't ruin it for me.
- Career women!

169
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,419
When you come home to an empty home,
what do you really have?

170
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,381
- Independence.
- It's overrated.

171
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,926
I'm going to make some cocoa
and you're not invited.

172
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,930
I'll be up in 5 minutes.
Have the little marshmallows I like.

173
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,978
- 150,000? That's an ambitious start.
- Here's a prospectus for you

174
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,481
with the startup costs, the overheard,

175
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,316
projected business profits...

176
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,694
Are you currently employed?

177
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:08,323
If I was, I wouldn't have the time
to start up a business, would I?

178
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,868
Do you have any assets?

179
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,164
I have drive, courage, and ambition.
If you look at the prospectus,

180
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,043
you'll see
a very sound business mind, too.

181
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,881
I'm talking stocks, bonds, property.

182
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:29,386
We're starting to sound
a little like a Men's Bank now.

183
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:34,308
Oh, as the Women's Bank, we should
ignore standard banking practices

184
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,518
and give you this unsecured loan

185
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,730
because you're the right gender.

186
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,609
Well, it would send a message.

187
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,695
Right, that women can't run a bank.

188
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,616
- Touché.
- We have depositors to protect

189
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,996
just like the boy banks. I'm sorry.
We must have collateral.

190
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:05,339
I have a 6-unit apartment building
that my father left to me.

191
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:15,682
Ms. Ayres, I admire you courage,
but are you sure?

192
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,811
No, but my father
took a chance buying it

193
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,732
and I'm sure he'd like me
to take a chance on this.

194
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,444
Alright. I'll draw up the papers.

195
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,321
Thank you.

196
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,730
Hi, Lisa. It's Laurel Ayres.

197
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,319
I've got my own firm,
Laurel Ayres Investments.

198
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,988
Is Mr. Anderson in?

199
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:17,160
We were very excited, but the
West Coast partners weren't. Sorry.

200
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,582
No,

201
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,170
I'm no longer with Manchester.
I've got my own place now.

202
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,797
Ayres Investments.

203
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,757
Is Mr. Johnson in?

204
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:35,929
Hell of a piece of work, Laurel.
I was impressed but my partner wasn't.

205
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,682
- I didn't know you had a partner.
- My wife.

206
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:44,229
No head for business, but she owns it
all. And she's wild in the sack.

207
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,527
You just had to read it.

208
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:56,491
What's in it for you? How about
2 tickets to the Ranger-Detroit game?

209
00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:01,079
The one that's sold out.
I happen to have tickets.

210
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:06,918
Yes, if you let me read you
the proposal during the game.

211
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:22,225
The payments are tax deferred.
You'll have a 19.5 percent return.

212
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:27,397
Sounds good, Laurel.
My partners won't leave Manchester.

213
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
No, thanks.

214
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,629
I understand.

215
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:55,509
Did you look at it? I'm sure...

216
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,011
No, but if I could...

217
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,306
No.

218
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,267
I understand.

219
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,730
No, what can you do
with a partner like that?

220
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,525
Alright.

221
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,610
Thank you.

222
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,875
Ms. Ayres.

223
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,424
Come in. What are you doing here?

224
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,845
Frank got your announcement.

225
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,599
- What did he say?
- Oh, he...

226
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:51,648
Nothing. He just laughed.
Oh this is beautiful. My gosh.

227
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,735
- Just beautiful.
- So,

228
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,408
- did Frank send you to spy on me?
- No, I wouldn't...

229
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:06,079
I just came hoping you might...
No, I wanted to see

230
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,374
- how you were doing.
- Fabulous.

231
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,630
I don't even have time to take my hair down.
- Great.

232
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,929
It does that all day, all day.

233
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,060
I'll let the machine get it.

234
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:30,604
I can do this.

235
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,900
- No, you don't need to.
- Don't worry.

236
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:40,906
Ayres Investment. Mr. Carl Bode?
I'm sorry, she's in a meeting.

237
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:44,492
One moment, she's coming out now.

238
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,119
Ms. Ayres?

239
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,580
Carl!

240
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,417
You got it? What did you think?

241
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:57,214
Great. And you loved it?
That's why I sent it to you.

242
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:01,593
I said who can I send this to?
Carl Bode!

243
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,347
Is it...

244
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:11,478
Can I talk to them?
I don't mind taking a meeting.

245
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:19,069
Oh well, I understand.
It's fine. Yeah, no.

246
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,572
I understand.

247
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,784
Yeah. Bye-bye.

248
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:47,514
Isn't it funny
that all the businessmen in this city

249
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:54,145
have partners that hate everything
that they love? Isn't it amusing?

250
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:03,822
I'm kidding myself.
They don't have partners. They're

251
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:07,075
brushing me off.

252
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,330
Sal,

253
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,838
would you mind calling Frank and
telling him I'd like my old job back?

254
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:26,094
Sure, sure. In the meantime
you can just set your head on fire.

255
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,559
- Who are you calling?
- Mr. Donald Fallon.

256
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:36,479
Fallon Industries.
He's not going to see me.

257
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,690
Hello, Betty?

258
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:43,653
Hi, Betty, it's Sally Dugan.
I heard you were great on the lanes.

259
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,448
Oh great!

260
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,368
Betty, I need a favor
if you could manage.

261
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:55,332
Could you put Laurel Ayres
on Mr. Fallon's calendar?

262
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,543
- He's booked for a month?
- Duh!

263
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:02,589
If you could do that for me,
it would be really great.

264
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,799
Monday night.

265
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,138
We'll take it. Monday's great.

266
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,851
Yeah, I'll see you on the lanes.
Owe you a coke. Bye-bye, Betty.

267
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,644
Okay, you're in.

268
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,105
The rest is up to you.

269
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,526
Go get 'em.

270
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:38,666
- I gotta take a leak.
- Alright boys, 5 minute break.

271
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:45,632
You just can't lose.
You've got a full deck up your sleeve.

272
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:50,887
- Bissel, an orange juice and soda.
- Yes, Mr. Fallon.

273
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:55,016
- I'm Laurel Ayres.
- You're Laurel Ayres?

274
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,855
- This is Laurel Ayres.
- I didn't set up the meeting.

275
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,150
He's a control freak.
That's why he's so good.

276
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,904
I have a prospectus here for you.

277
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:12,909
Give it to Bissel. He'll give it
to the partners. Nice meeting you.

278
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,411
No.

279
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,204
- No?
- No.

280
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,248
No partners. It's for your eyes only.

281
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,794
- All proposals go through the partners.
- They never read them.

282
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,671
Are you brushing me off?

283
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,925
Yes, and I thought I was nice.

284
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,681
To be honest, I thought
Laurel Ayres was a firm.

285
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,352
Two guys.
I thought I was meeting Mr. Laurel

286
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:44,566
and Mr. Ayres. Oh, the losers
are going in. I have join them.

287
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,445
- I'm sorry.
- You are meeting 2 guys.

288
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:56,494
Well, I'm not a guy but my partner
is and there are two of us.

289
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,831
If it's so important, where's he now?

290
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:04,919
Away, in Asia
at the Asian Economic Summit,

291
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,672
where he's a guest speaker.

292
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:12,969
You trying to impress me?
That's good. What's his name?

293
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,846
Yes, his name.

294
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,849
They give them to babies, don't they?

295
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,976
Of course.

296
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:23,188
- To him, too.
- Come on, Donald.

297
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,482
I'm coming.

298
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,985
By the way, I accept credit cards.

299
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,405
Cutty.

300
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:40,163
It's his name. First name Robert,
middle initial 'S', last name Cutty.

301
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,663
- My partner, Robert S. Cutty.
- Never heard of him.

302
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:47,629
Well he's heard of you. He's concerned
about one of your companies,

303
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,547
Banff Refrigeration.

304
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:55,303
It's doing fine.
- Until 1998, when the CFC ban goes into effect.

305
00:25:56,013 --> 00:26:00,600
Ban? - You'll have to convert.
But he knows a company with a device

306
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,769
that makes it unnecessary.

307
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:08,149
It would save you millions. But you're not interested.
- Wait!

308
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,570
I am interested. Let me see it.
- No. - What, no? Let me see it.

309
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,739
- No!
- Yes.

310
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,159
- Hand it over.
- Alright!

311
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,289
I'll read it carefully.
If it's any good, you'll hear from me.

312
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,792
Alright. Thanks.

313
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:35,218
Damn that strange woman.
Bissel! Move your ass. Any you boys

314
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,929
heard of this guy Cutty?

315
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:43,643
Who's there? Ashley? This is Laurel.
I want to talk to Sally.

316
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,814
Frank's assistant.

317
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,902
What, you are? Where's Sally?

318
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:57,282
She's Harry's assistant?
Harry is an assistant.

319
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,953
Don't take that tone with me.
Yes, I do know the extension.

320
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:04,706
Goodbye.

321
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,586
Harry. I don't believe
Harry got my old job.

322
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:20,221
- Mrs. Cutty? A note for Mr. Cutty.
- You've got the wrong address.

323
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,016
From Mr. Fallon.

324
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,936
He's in the bathroom.
I'll take that. Thank you.

325
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,539
Hi, I'm here to see Mr. Fallon.

326
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:52,629
Impossible.
- No, it's not. My name is Laurel Ayres. I have an appointment.

327
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,300
The only guest
Mr. Fallon has listed is Mr. Cutty.

328
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:03,222
He's my partner. I'll tell him he's not coming.
- Ms. Ayres.

329
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:09,479
This is the Peabody Club. I'll see
if Mr. Fallon wishes to come out.

330
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:18,237
Women aren't allowed past the
lobby. Just for the last 150 years.

331
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,907
We couldn't get this far until 1989.

332
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,494
Camille Scott,
Mr. Fallon's personal broker.

333
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:29,123
- Camille, you look incredible.
- I knew I would be seeing you.

334
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,418
Nice to see you,
but where's Mr. Cutty?

335
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:38,383
Stuck in a meeting. - More important than this?
- Call him

336
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:44,389
- and tell him he's got 5 minutes.
- I can't do that.

337
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,975
It's not that
he's in a meeting, meeting.

338
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,852
Really?

339
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:55,024
The fact of the matter is...
I can't...

340
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,859
Stop.

341
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:02,865
I don't jerk people around.
I want to do business with Mr. Cutty.

342
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,912
Even though I'm under no obligation,

343
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,290
I'm giving him a full commission.

344
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,839
- This means you...
- Bought the entire company.

345
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:22,176
You tell Mr. Cutty
to be at my office at 9 am tomorrow.

346
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,262
I... look...

347
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:30,184
I don't want to lie to you.
He doesn't really...

348
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,062
- He's not...
- Tell him

349
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:36,649
that Donald Fallon doesn't do
business with people he's never met.

350
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,991
But, Mr. Fallon, you just did.

351
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:49,245
Thank you.

352
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,836
Damn.

353
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:02,383
Okay, Mr. Cutty,
time to bring you to life.

354
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,148
Nice.

355
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,609
Mr. Cutty.

356
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,654
Date of birth?

357
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:30,703
October 29, 1929 is perfect.
Black Thursday.

358
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:36,334
A financial world crashes,
a new savior is born.

359
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,295
I really like you, Mr. Cutty.

360
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:44,300
67,
so where have you been all this time?

361
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:49,931
You should have retired.
Living in Switzerland.

362
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:55,561
You made a fortune
and then you left. Now you're back.

363
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,188
Where are you?

364
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:02,109
At the Plaza. Such good taste.

365
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:08,574
Oh yes, jock,
because you play polo.

366
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:13,079
You're a big game hunter,
because you're such a man.

367
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:18,292
What about your wife? Married?
Widower? No.

368
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,880
We'd have to dig up the wife.
Never married.

369
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:29,303
Just 67, so why...
He's searching for one true love.

370
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,348
But he hasn't found it yet.

371
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:36,352
Not the stuff of a business partner
but he's a bit different.

372
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:40,565
That's cool. Net worth?

373
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:46,112
They want to know everything.
What's your net worth, Mr. Cutty?

374
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:47,738
Unknown.

375
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,910
Cup of coffee, Mr. Cutty?
You look a little pale.

376
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,371
Caucasian

377
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,092
I got you a present.

378
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:12,889
As a thanks for the Fallon meeting.
He bought the proposal.

379
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:18,519
Now I've got offices, a new partner.
Stationery. -A partner?

380
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,313
It's no big deal.

381
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,399
You didn't have to do this.
Thank you.

382
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,443
Thanks.

383
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:33,534
If there's ever anything
I could do for you, just call.

384
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,538
And thanks again.

385
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,296
- I need a job.
- What? You have one already.

386
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:50,843
It's a dead-end job. You
and your partner need an assistant.

387
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:55,681
If the company grows, there's room for advancement.
- You know,

388
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,268
my partner does all the hiring.

389
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,689
Set up a meeting for me.

390
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,817
That's kind of difficult.

391
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:08,653
Why?

392
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:14,158
He's got somebody he wants
to work with and I don't want

393
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,244
- to step on his feet.
- You, of all people!

394
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,288
What do you mean?

395
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:24,126
- What?
- I want you, but my partner doesn't.

396
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,088
That's not a brush off.

397
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:31,467
It's a little one.
Why do you want to work for us?

398
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:37,264
- We're a tiny company.
- Gosh, I've watched you for 5 years.

399
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,310
I know how you work.
No one's like you. You're so good.

400
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:45,398
And you don't know this,
but there's nobody better than me.

401
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,066
We don't have much money.

402
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,276
I'll take it.

403
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,908
Okay, you're hired.

404
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:08,004
Wait until you see Mr. Cutty's office. - My gosh.
- Put your stuff down.

405
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,511
Not really my taste,
but what's a girl to do?

406
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,556
It's so beautiful.

407
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,517
- It's so beautiful.
- I'll tell him.

408
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:26,689
And the fireplace. My.
Did he shoot that rhino?

409
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:31,569
It's possible. He travels so much
and brings lots back.

410
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:38,367
My gosh, he knows
all those famous people?

411
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,661
Enough to open a deli.

412
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,165
I can't wait to see your office.

413
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,333
My office? Well,

414
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:51,130
I don't exactly have one per se.
So I'll just be using this one.

415
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,718
There's only one desk.

416
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,221
- Is there a problem?
- No problem. It's just...

417
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,683
It's beautiful.

418
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,982
How did you meet him?

419
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,567
Who?

420
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,277
Mr. Cutty.

421
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,617
- He read one of my proposals.
- How did he get it?

422
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,912
I don't know. He got it from somebody.

423
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:28,459
He made some amazing changes
and we worked on it over the weekend.

424
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,545
I like the name Cutty. It's strong.

425
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,256
Yeah, better than Wild Turkey.

426
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:47,269
I thought I saw somebody.
No, it's him. Aesop Franklin.

427
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,942
Seriously, his name is Aesop?
What's he do?

428
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:57,113
Don't you read
Omni magazine? He's only the CEO

429
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,198
of Syntonex.

430
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:03,035
Here he comes. What's he doing here?

431
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,538
Don't look.

432
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:11,460
He's a CEO?
- He started a software business in his basement.

433
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,631
He should get out more.

434
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:21,762
Mr. Jacobson, I'm sorry I'm late.

435
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:25,808
I looked in and didn't think
this would be the place...

436
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:27,852
Get your coat.

437
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,230
- The food hasn't come.
- It doesn't matter.

438
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,443
- We haven't eaten yet.
- Get your coat on. Come on.

439
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,321
Did we...

440
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:40,948
Put it on!

441
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:48,247
What do you want?
- Don't you get it? Aesop Franklin and Randall Jacobson!

442
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:53,085
The president of Hewlett Packard's PC division.
- So?

443
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:58,716
Do you know what it means? Hewlett
Packard is taking over Syntonex.

444
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,386
- How do you know that?
- Look where they're meeting.

445
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:07,391
So? - Someplace
where no one is going to see them.

446
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,689
- We saw them.
- Yes, we did.

447
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,734
- We saw them.
- Yes, we saw them.

448
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,530
So who do I tell? Someone who'll blab,
someone with a big...

449
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,949
Oh, I know who.

450
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:33,500
You can trust me, Laurel.
Discretion is my creed.

451
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,419
It's written all over you.

452
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:40,633
Let's face it, men like doing business with men.
- That's right.

453
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:45,137
But they want to sleep with us.
That's our power.

454
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,143
- Why doesn't Cutty buy the stock himself?
- Personal reasons.

455
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:57,233
I should meet with him first,
and see what he likes.

456
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:02,696
To be perfectly honest,
he really likes Syntonex.

457
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,742
Syntonex?
That stock is in free-fall.

458
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:11,622
Their marketing and distribution are
a joke and they're way in debt.

459
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:17,336
- It'd be a miracle if the stock moved up.
- Mr. Cutty likes miracles.

460
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:23,509
- I trust this will remain between us?
- Laurel, I'm a professional.

461
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,427
I know.

462
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:34,079
- Syntonex stock is still climbing.
- I read the papers.

463
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:38,876
What about Cutty?
- I had to dig but I did find this file here.

464
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,128
Give it to me inside.

465
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,719
- Everything okay out there?
- Yes, thanks.

466
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,599
Ms. Ayres,
when can I meet Mr. Cutty?

467
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,976
Probably never.

468
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,813
- Never?
- Not never ever,

469
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,734
just not ever.
He's a real globetrotter.

470
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,613
Doesn't he ever trot to New York?

471
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:14,161
Of course. He just left. But,
with faxes and phones, why bother?

472
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:18,499
Mr. Fallon!

473
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,211
- Good morning, Ms. Ayres.
- Nice to see you again.

474
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,924
Is Cutty in?
- He's never in. - This early. He's never in

475
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,801
this early.

476
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,640
Sally, you can go.
- My desk is here. - Of course.

477
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:40,187
It's where... Come with me into Mr. Cutty's office.
- Thank you.

478
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,276
- Congratulations on Syntonex.
- You weren't supposed to tell anyone.

479
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,029
- You know how this town is.
- I'm learning.

480
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,867
- Why didn't he tell his friends?
- His friends are also his clients.

481
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,537
And you're still with Manchester.

482
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,833
- He knows Barbara Streisand?
- They dated.

483
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,963
By the way, Mr. Cutty wants
you to sell his Syntonex shares at 54.

484
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:10,134
54? Most analysts predict
it will peak in the 60s.

485
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,762
Mr. Cutty
isn't like most analysts, is he?

486
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,931
- Ms. Ayres.
- Yes?

487
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:22,062
I'm ready to throw a lot of money
Cutty's way, my money.

488
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,065
He just needs to meet with us.

489
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,818
We spoke about it. It's not possible.

490
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,531
However,
I could cancel my 10 am.

491
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:37,661
I just might fly down to Florida and
crash his meeting with Harley Mason.

492
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,998
- You know about it?
- Harley called me to gloat.

493
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:45,294
Not for long. Mr. Cutty
can't make that meeting either.

494
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:50,090
- I'm in charge.
- Really? What's your handicap?

495
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:57,055
- I don't play golf.
- Harley goes to Florida to play golf.

496
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,185
He only talks business
on the back 9.

497
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:07,149
Have Cutty call me. Have a nice trip.
Come on, Bissel, move your ass.

498
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,340
I'll take this one.

499
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:39,264
At the back 9, you disappear.
I want to speak to Cutty alone.

500
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,060
Mr. Mason.

501
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,563
Laurel Ayres, Mr. Cutty's partner.
Unfortunately he's been tied up

502
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,108
in Bangkok,
but he did send a replacement.

503
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,693
You?

504
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:57,824
I'm the queen of the windmill hole.
I do that well, but... Johnny.

505
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:03,413
- Johnny Miller!
- Mind if I tag along?

506
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:09,294
Hell no. And I won't even mention
how much I lost when you won

507
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:13,215
- at Pebble Beach in 1994.
- Sorry about that.

508
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:17,553
Let me win a few holes
so I can brag a little later.

509
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:23,183
You boys have a good time.
We'll talk about the proposal later.

510
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:28,063
Ms. Ayres, consider it sold.

511
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:34,861
No? - You tell Robert Cutty
that he's in a class by himself.

512
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:39,741
Ain't he though?
Get going. Johnny's waiting.

513
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,618
Hit a couple of them for me.

514
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,415
Oops, excuse me.

515
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:58,837
Donald, you're a friend and I must warn
you. Nobody knows who this Cutty is.

516
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,346
He bought Syntonex
before it went up

517
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:07,477
and sold it, one point before it went
down. Now he has Harley Mason.

518
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:12,107
Lucky shot.
Look who he chose for a partner.

519
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,109
I fired her!

520
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:18,780
I wouldn't spread it around.
Sorry, Walter.

521
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,326
That's how the cookie crumbles.

522
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,080
If Donald Fallon leaves,
others will follow.

523
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:31,335
Get something on Cutty
or get us into bed with him.

524
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:35,797
The buzz from Wall Street:
Move over Dean Witter,

525
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:42,095
step aside Walter Manchester.
There's a new bull in town

526
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,931
and his name is Robert Cutty.

527
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:48,477
Cindy Mason, the New York Post.

528
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:52,230
Thank you for your faith.
Mr. Cutty won't let you down.

529
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,984
- When will he contact us?
- Probably never.

530
00:44:56,444 --> 00:45:00,447
He only calls when something goes
wrong. No one ever hears from him.

531
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:04,034
I see.
Thank you, Laurel. Gentlemen.

532
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,836
So tired...

533
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,924
You can't relax quite yet.

534
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,886
3 more Cindy Mason readers
are due in a half hour.

535
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,264
Alright, I'll have to get out the box.

536
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:27,974
The box?

537
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,478
The one with all my great ideas
that Manchester hated.

538
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:35,148
Oh, that box. I got rid of it.

539
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,859
- It was so cluttered in the closet.
- You what?

540
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:41,113
- I got rid of it.
- Go get it.

541
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:45,033
- It's in the garbage.
- You throw away my box

542
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:50,497
with all the great ideas that Cutty
and I loved and Manchester hated?

543
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,084
- I put it all in here.
- What?

544
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:58,964
All your files are in a program
that I designed. It's cataloged,

545
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,218
categorized, cross-categorized,
indexed, and referenced.

546
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,472
- The box is in here?
- Yes.

547
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,814
This is great.

548
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:19,860
- Who knew you had it in you?
- I did.

549
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,071
- You were wasted on Frank.
- Yes.

550
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:28,452
Cutty Ayres. One moment, Miss Scott.
It's that woman for Mr. Cutty.

551
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,209
Laurel, I wanted to speak with Robert.

552
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:41,256
You missed him. He was in
Washington. Now he's off to the Pope.

553
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,219
The Pope depends on his advice.

554
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,221
Really?

555
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:52,058
- I wanted to thank him for the flowers.
- He sent you flowers?

556
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,144
- You didn't know?
- No.

557
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:59,065
I can't know everything
that goes on here. What, Sally?

558
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:04,279
Wait. I'm sorry, I've got to go.
Robert's on the other other line...

559
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:08,450
- Tell him I'm on the line.
- Bye-bye.

560
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,248
That woman!

561
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,461
This is fabulous. Incredible.

562
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:23,590
It's amazing. You're a find!

563
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:29,429
- Would you tell Mr. Cutty?
- Yes, sure.

564
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:35,143
Pope.

565
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,312
Mr. Carter?

566
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,690
Frank Peterson
from Manchester Investments.

567
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,530
I understand. I'll get to the point.
Robert Cutty.

568
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:52,327
I was wondering if you've had
any contact with him abroad.

569
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,331
His company is small.

570
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,752
I can't find anyone
who has met him.

571
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,772
He's very weird.

572
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:24,359
Eccentric.
He won't take meetings.

573
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,363
C-U-T-T-Y.

574
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:32,492
I think it's spelled like the Scotch.

575
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,414
His phone number?

576
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:42,419
I understand you have a reservation.
It will be at least 20 minutes.

577
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:48,383
It's just a fad. Cutty'll crash
and take his clients with him.

578
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,385
Excuse me.

579
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:56,099
I'm here with Donald Trump.
How long is it going to be?

580
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:01,229
I have checks on two tables.
Ms. Ayres. How nice to see you.

581
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:05,150
Mr. Cutty's usual table.

582
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:15,410
Sorry, Frank. I'm going
to crash and burn with Cutty. Call me.

583
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:26,838
Hello, welcome aboard.
Please fasten your seatbelt.

584
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:36,723
Aesop Franklin, right?
How was your stockholders' meeting

585
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,018
at Hewlett Packard?

586
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,605
- Do I know you?
- No.

587
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:48,276
Laurel Ayres with Cutty Ayres
Investments. We talk about you often.

588
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,071
You need some investment counseling.

589
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,449
I don't understand...

590
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:59,204
You're selling your company.
You can't put all that money

591
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,166
- in a savings account.
- There's the misunderstanding.

592
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,294
There's no money. Just a job.

593
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,465
What, no money?
You do this for a lousy job?

594
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:15,470
- The job's not lousy, the deal's lousy.
- Why are you doing it?

595
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,390
- I have to.
- You have to?

596
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,393
Syntonex is...

597
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,145
bankrupt.

598
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:31,653
Bankrupt. The only way to save it
is to give it away.

599
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,990
You can't just give away a company.

600
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:42,872
Imagine that you have a company
and you really love it.

601
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:49,212
It's your whole life. Right?
But your company is dying.

602
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:54,134
There may be another way to save it.

603
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:59,723
I know someone you should talk to. Robert Cutty.
- Robert Cutty?

604
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:04,561
Who are you? - Laurel Ayres.
- Laurel, I'm Aesop...

605
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:08,523
Franklin. - Yeah.
- Page 15. - Robert Cutty.

606
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,901
If anybody can save it, he can.

607
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,073
- Sally, I'm back.
- Welcome, welcome.

608
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,744
Sally, Aesop. Aesop, Sally.

609
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:22,287
Hello.

610
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:27,500
- I wanted to go home, but...
- Cutty's going to save his company.

611
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,129
- Did any files arrive for me today?
- I think so.

612
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:34,632
- On your desk.
- Very good, thank you.

613
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,344
Come on.

614
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,690
- These are your files?
- It's a mess, huh?

615
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:56,946
- Anything alive in there?
- Hopeless, I know. I can't run a company.

616
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,824
I can't even run a bath.

617
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:04,704
What if Hewlett Packard finds out?
I'll lose everything.

618
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,165
Aesop, sit down.

619
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,545
- Sit down?
- Sit! Sally, come for a second.

620
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:17,842
I have a challenge for your program.
Will it be a problem?

621
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:25,975
No problem. - Really?
- Maybe a little one.

622
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:31,106
That envelop on top,
you have to RSVP by this evening.

623
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:36,653
Mr. Fallon invites you and Mr. Cutty
to his Thanksgiving charity ball.

624
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,615
It's black tie.
Unless you're a pilgrim.

625
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,374
Everybody
in the financial world will be there.

626
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:53,586
Good. Very good. Aesop!

627
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,468
If you come as my date, you can meet
the movers and shakers.

628
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:05,682
Okay, I love black tie parties.
Even I look good.

629
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,725
I'm sure you do.

630
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:11,855
Alrighty then.

631
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,731
Thank you, Sally.

632
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:36,671
No business like show business.
So girlfriend, what look this time?

633
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:41,926
I don't know, Charlie. All those
big wigs from Wall Street are there.

634
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:46,389
- The slut look never failed.
- I have to look intelligent, too.

635
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,683
I'm representing Robert Cutty.

636
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:54,731
Slutty, yet intelligent.

637
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,358
News anchor.

638
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,470
Now this is giving thanks.

639
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:31,935
- Don't leave me alone with all them.
- You're crushing my hand.

640
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,604
Shall we go in?

641
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:36,773
Are you alright?

642
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,818
Avery profitable merger.
Arigato.

643
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,530
Ms. Ayres. Excuse me.

644
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:50,536
- My money was never in prettier hands.
- And had a better rate of return.

645
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:55,875
Cutty is amazing. No doubt.
The governor knows him from Wharton.

646
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:58,461
He's never mentioned it.

647
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:03,132
Where is Robert?
He wrote me saying he was coming.

648
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:07,303
He's stuck in Bangladesh,
so he won't be here, but

649
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:13,977
I've got someone equally brilliant.
Aesop Franklin, CEO of Syntonex.

650
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,563
Not any more.
Congratulations on the sale.

651
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:22,068
Mr. Cutty may end up
disappointing Hewlett Packard.

652
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:28,825
I'm intrigued. Camille,
get Mr. Franklin a drink.

653
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,787
- I love your tux.
- Laurel.

654
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,497
Go ahead.

655
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:39,127
- Tell me more.
- Robert seems to think

656
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:43,339
that if left independent
Syntonex can be a money machine.

657
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:47,302
- He knows about the mess it's in?
- He's fixed worse ones.

658
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:51,222
Cutty is going to reorganize it?

659
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,517
- Personally?
- And oversee it's management.

660
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,144
He's that sure?

661
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:03,192
He's putting his own money in, until
he finds a few, select investors.

662
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:10,450
- I'll talk to a few people. I'll be back.
- I know you will.

663
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:26,341
Laurel Ayres? Cindy Mason,
I write a little column.

664
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:30,053
I loved what you wrote
about Mr. Cutty. Thank you.

665
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:35,099
Thanks. I'm flattered. I'd love
to write your fascinating story.

666
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,852
Really? Now I'm flattered.

667
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:44,484
A young woman starts at the bottom
and stays there

668
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:49,238
only to wind up the partner of the
most-talked about man on Wall Street.

669
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:52,992
- Sounds like fiction.
- The best stories always do.

670
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,453
When I tell them.

671
00:56:57,081 --> 00:57:01,959
Of course, I'd have to talk
to Mr. Cutty, in person.

672
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:05,713
To tell my story?

673
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,884
- A perfect arrangement, isn't it?
- Not so perfect.

674
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,136
Mr. Cutty doesn't speak to the press.

675
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,680
- Nice to meet you.
- Laurel,

676
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:18,267
it doesn't pay not to talk to Cindy.

677
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:23,940
- I like your do.
- Do you?

678
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,735
I do, too.

679
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:39,831
I'm a little shy,
so don't leave me alone. Wow, Laurel!

680
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,542
You look great. What happened?

681
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:47,547
It happens to women who leave bad relationships.
- Come on.

682
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:52,510
Let's be friends. Dance with me.
I've got news for you.

683
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,930
And I'm not saying anything,
unless we can dance.

684
00:57:56,306 --> 00:58:00,643
- Dance faster, you make my skin crawl.
- I've missed your sense of humor.

685
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:05,565
Here it is.
Manchester wants you back.

686
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:11,571
Really? Did they discover
that your ideas were actually mine?

687
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:15,158
He respects you. Always has.

688
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:20,538
- He wants you to be senior VP.
- VP? Senior?

689
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:24,292
You'd be one of the
highest-ranking women in business.

690
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,628
And your boss, Frank.

691
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,797
I'd move up, too.

692
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,926
Just think,
Manchester and Cutty together.

693
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:36,345
We'd own Wall Street.

694
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:41,184
Forget it, baby.
Manchester doesn't get Cutty or me.

695
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:44,770
If it's not Manchester,
it'll be someone else.

696
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:48,608
Everyone wants Cutty.
And without him, you're nothing.

697
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:55,615
You know, Frank,
I can afford to have you killed.

698
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,743
Is that a no?

699
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:06,959
Computer links will make
the next lead. Here we go!

700
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:13,299
You can conference with
the library in Moscow,

701
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,968
and your grandmother in South America.

702
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,262
You! You try it.

703
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,265
Very good.

704
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,978
It's a point-and-click-interface.
Anybody can do it!

705
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,730
Not me.

706
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:32,443
- Should we check your portfolio?
- Don't you dare!

707
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:38,950
Did you know
about this Interlink software?

708
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,245
- It's revolutionary.
- We know.

709
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,039
Check this out.

710
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:55,007
Laurel, we have to meet
Cutty on this. In person.

711
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:59,845
- Robert Cutty, in person. You get it?
- I'll try.

712
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:04,892
He's not into personal meetings.
I'll do my best.

713
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:07,103
That's not enough.

714
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:11,107
All I want is when and where.

715
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:17,071
I'll call him and see what I can do.
Then I'll call you.

716
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:33,045
Have you seen the paper?
This Cindy Mason. This trash.

717
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:37,008
- The cow didn't even mention me.
- Is it true about the affairs?

718
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:40,011
I thought
Mr. Cutty was searching for true love.

719
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:46,225
He's a man. That's how they search. - Something happen yesterday?
- To me?

720
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:51,063
What could have happened?
Nobody wanted me, only Cutty.

721
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:56,986
The guy is a pain in my behind.
I regret the day I ever made him up,

722
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:02,325
him a part of my life.

723
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:06,787
As if I had nothing to do
with Cutty Ayres. Like I didn't exist.

724
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:11,417
Okay, let's go back 2 months.

725
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,211
Yes, 2 months B.C.

726
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:16,631
B.C.?

727
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,008
Before Cutty.

728
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,428
You don't have enough to do, do you?

729
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:29,560
Before Cutty, you had no job,
no prospects, and a big debt.

730
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,564
- Minor details.
- Even you call him a genius.

731
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:39,695
He's as elusive as Howard Hughes,
and you give him all the credit.

732
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:44,659
- So he gets a little respect.
- You got what you wanted.

733
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,078
- Thank you.
- Now what's

734
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:50,539
- this secret Cutty meeting?
- You don't want to know.

735
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:55,711
CNN called, The Times called.
Cindy Mason offered me $1000

736
01:01:56,213 --> 01:02:01,342
- for the location.
- Cindy Mason offered you $1000

737
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,177
for the location?

738
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:05,680
Yeah.

739
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,935
Call her and tell her you'll take it.

740
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:12,728
What?

741
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,440
Take her money
and the money from everyone else, too!

742
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:20,695
What are you planning?

743
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:25,282
I'm going to prepare a whammy.

744
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:36,252
- What's with Cutty?
- My feet are killing me.

745
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:42,800
If that camera touches my hair again,
you'Il be sending from your bowels.

746
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,976
Hello darling, how are you? I thought it was secret.
- So did I.

747
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:59,275
- The door's locked.
- Robert, please!

748
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,485
Come on. It's him.

749
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:05,281
They're here for you, Robert. Robert!

750
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:16,834
Leave him alone! You should know better, Cindy!
- Oh please!

751
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,338
Who does Cutty think he is,
standing us up like this?

752
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:26,260
Preposterous. I thought we'd see him finally.
- A waste of time.

753
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:31,682
Somehow the press found out.
He couldn't come through that throng.

754
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:35,352
How can he run a company?

755
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:40,274
You wanted Mr. Cutty- He's right here.
His ideas are right in front of you.

756
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,276
Thank you.

757
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:47,323
I'm sure it's fascinating,
but Frank's right. Without Cutty

758
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,493
- I'm going to have to pass.
- I agree.

759
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:53,287
- Bissel, my coat.
- I tried.

760
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:55,664
My conscience is clear.

761
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,792
What?

762
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:01,045
I told Robert,
these are important men.

763
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:05,925
Some are clients. We made promises.

764
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:11,013
We have a moral obligation to them.

765
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:14,809
Wait. You mean that Cutty...

766
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:20,731
He ran the numbers and wants to keep
Syntonex for himself. I'm sorry.

767
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:23,901
This is bullshit.

768
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:29,198
Yeah. Tell Mr. Manchester that
you told Mr. Fallon not to do this.

769
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:34,662
- Mr. Fallon, I didn't say that.
- Shut up, Frank. Just calm yourself.

770
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,373
I don't want you to...

771
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,001
Control yourself. Gentlemen,

772
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:43,879
turn to page 1.
Let's begin to read.

773
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,757
- Donald, I'm so sorry.
- It's alright.

774
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,260
Syntonex consolidated financial...

775
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,138
- Page 2 is better.
- Page 2.

776
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,438
Come on, Bissel. Move you ass.

777
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,698
Problems, Frank? Trouble in paradise?

778
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:23,127
What happened?

779
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:26,046
They went for it.

780
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,096
Come on. I've got a surprise.

781
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:47,651
We all pitched in and

782
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:52,114
got something to show our gratitude.

783
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,994
I hope Mr. Cutty smokes cigars.

784
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,247
Tell Mr. Cutty thanks, thanks

785
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:03,334
for saving our jobs.

786
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,800
This is my favorite time of the year.

787
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:16,221
When I was a kid, every Christmas
my dad gave me a railroad ticket.

788
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,307
One way?

789
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:19,767
No.

790
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:26,148
He'd buy a ticket for him and for me.
We'd take the train and go somewhere.

791
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:31,862
Once we ended up in Cleveland.
He managed to make it wonderful.

792
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,823
- You don't still do that?
- No.

793
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:40,663
He passed away.
Every Christmas I light a candle.

794
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:47,211
That's a great story. Thank you.

795
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:53,133
- Can you handle another story?
- Sure.

796
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,981
Robert Cutty doesn't exist.

797
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,446
You don't understand.
I made him up.

798
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:16,573
I've known that for weeks.

799
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:21,745
What? For weeks?

800
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:27,334
Sure. Every idea Cutty had
was already in your files

801
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,421
or I saw you come up with it.

802
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:33,716
Why didn't you say anything?

803
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:38,178
And stop getting
those great gifts. No!

804
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:43,350
I loved it.
If you had to make up a white male

805
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,812
so people would recognize your talent,

806
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:52,192
it was my job
to keep the illusion going

807
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:57,489
- and support you.
- You knew and didn't say a thing!

808
01:07:57,866 --> 01:08:01,076
- Yeah, sure.
- You're something else.

809
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:02,536
Oh, thanks.

810
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:07,583
When I take over Syntonex,
I'm going to need somebody

811
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:13,088
to help me organize and run
the company. Interested?

812
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,176
- Are you kidding?
- No.

813
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,262
- Yes.
- Yes? Is that a yes?

814
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,601
Nice little yes dance. Okay!

815
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:37,946
- This will flush out Cutty.
- I know someone who could help out.

816
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:41,116
- I thought so.
- A friend at the SEC.

817
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:47,498
I'll have Eddie on Laurel's tail, 24 hours a day.
- Incognito.

818
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,541
Great.

819
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:54,213
Agent Thompkins, Frank Peterson.
I thought you might be interested

820
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:59,218
in Cindy Mason's column
before it's published tomorrow.

821
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,929
Morning, Sally.

822
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:05,182
- Be right there, Ms. Ayres.
- Great.

823
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:10,562
You made me feel so much better,
I had to go shopping.

824
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:14,191
For you. Merry Christmas.

825
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:19,363
Agent Thompkins of the SEC
is waiting to meet Mr. Cutty.

826
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:27,579
Agent Thompkins. How are you?
I'm Laurel Ayres.

827
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:30,332
How can I help you?

828
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:36,421
- I'd like to see Mr. Cutty.
- Who wouldn't. He's not available.

829
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:41,552
- I'll tell him you were here.
- Wasn't Aesop Franklin your date

830
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:46,765
- at Donald Fallon's Thanksgiving party?
- Yes, is that illegal?

831
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:51,061
I'm sure Mr. Cutty can explain it.

832
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,522
See that he gets this.

833
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:55,816
A judicial subpoena?

834
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:57,693
Because I'm in a picture

835
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:02,447
with Aesop Franklin?
- Well, Mr. Cutty did profit personally from Syntonex.

836
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:06,869
- But he didn't do anything illegal.
- He can clear that up when we meet.

837
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:09,663
If he doesn't cooperate,

838
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:14,751
I'm afraid we'll have to conduct
a full-scale investigation.

839
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,336
Happy holidays.

840
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:26,680
- This isn't even close to rational.
- Charlie is my only shot.

841
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:32,060
- What if you just told the truth?
- Are you crazy? It's fraud!

842
01:10:32,604 --> 01:10:34,897
They'll throw me in jail.
This is insane.

843
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,943
If I had just closed the Syntonex
deal, it would have been fine.

844
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:41,987
Merry Christmas.

845
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:46,950
Is Santa following us?
- Don't get paranoid. I've got big fish to fry.

846
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:50,204
- Come on.
- He's following us.

847
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,707
This is crazy.

848
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:58,128
- This is nuts.
- Not that door, this one.

849
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,676
Hello, ladies.

850
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:09,431
- What is it now?
- I need a new look.

851
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:12,100
- That's what I live for.
- I hope so.

852
01:11:12,644 --> 01:11:17,731
Distinguished,
rich, powerful, old, and

853
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:20,817
- male.
- Now it's getting interesting.

854
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:23,403
White.

855
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:27,157
White?
- He's gotta be white. - Oh shit.

856
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,619
- This is crazy.
- You got a better idea?

857
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:34,957
- Charlie can work miracles.
- I could use one right now.

858
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:36,792
I'm on.

859
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:43,090
Slip into Ethel. Let the sand out
of the tits. I'll be right back.

860
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:46,760
May I never get this old.

861
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:58,730
- My name is Robert Cutty.
- Deeper. A few octaves.

862
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:04,361
My name is Robert Cutty.
- Deeper. - My name is...

863
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:07,990
Deeper! - Any deeper,
I'll be talking out of my uterus.

864
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:09,658
More male attitude.

865
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,328
Alright.

866
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:19,376
Bob Cutty, and I'm going to bite your booty in my truck.
- Male,

867
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,586
not moron.

868
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,171
Done.

869
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:30,012
- Will this fool the SEC?
- Wow. It's a miracle.

870
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:34,224
Before I go on stage,
I try out my new look in public.

871
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,935
- In public?
- In public.

872
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,814
Mr. Cutty? Of course!

873
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:46,570
He can expect the very best.
Without notice. Confidentiality?

874
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,572
Madam, this is the Plaza.

875
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:52,367
- And Cutty?
- Fallon will approach him at the SEC.

876
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:56,830
- So Hewlett Packard is in?
- They're in, if Fallon is in.

877
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:01,001
- Jacobson will tell him at dinner.
- At the Plaza.

878
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:05,130
- His favorite place.
- Nice work, Frank.

879
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:11,845
Charlotte, Mr. Cutty is on his way.
Inspect the royal suite. Simon.

880
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:16,808
Fresh flowers in the suite. Take them
from our other guests, if needed.

881
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:20,812
José, our best champagne and caviar.

882
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:25,859
Thomas, out front. You're there
for Mr. Cutty alone. Go on!

883
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:27,903
Wait!

884
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,823
Our guests' privacy is sacred.

885
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:43,502
Lily at the business desk.

886
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:49,257
- Good evening, Randall. You remember Walter.
- Hello.

887
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:52,177
Fallon's meeting us in the Palm Court.

888
01:13:56,099 --> 01:14:00,102
Camille? It's me, Tommy.
Guess who's coming to town?

889
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:04,147
Ms. Mason, Frederick from the Plaza.

890
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:06,775
He's coming.

891
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:14,574
Hello, my name is Robert Cutty.

892
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,121
Is that you, Mr. Cutty?

893
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:23,542
Hello, I am Robert Cutty.

894
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,544
Can I get your bags, Sir?

895
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:29,923
I'm not staying long enough
to need any. Excuse me.

896
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,716
Got you.

897
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,303
- Yes, I did.
- All the flowers in place?

898
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:37,305
Champagne, caviar?

899
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:40,642
- Can I get your coat for you, Mr. Cutty?
- No.

900
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:47,357
Welcome to the Plaza. Frederick,
the manager. We're deeply honored.

901
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:52,696
If there's anything I can do
to make your stay more pleasant,

902
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:57,367
- please call me personally.
- I just want to get to my room.

903
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:00,620
I have seen to every amenity.

904
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:06,251
Tony, you heard of that Cutty?
Guess what, he's here!

905
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:10,172
Cutty? Robert Cutty here?

906
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:15,677
Maybe he'd join us,
and we could finish this tonight.

907
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:17,888
Ms. Ayres...

908
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:23,477
- asked that all charges be on her account.
- Excuse me,

909
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:27,939
- I'm looking for Robert Cutty.
- Well, Cutty.

910
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:31,401
I'll find my room myself.

911
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:33,778
Thomas!

912
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:38,742
- Can you help me? I'm looking...
- Don't hesitate to call me.

913
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:42,829
It's a private elevator.

914
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:50,295
If something's not okay, call Thomas the bellhop.
- Thanks.

915
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:55,926
I won't say goodnight,
because I know it'll be great.

916
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:08,730
Robert.

917
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:10,649
It's me,

918
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,067
Camille.

919
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,236
Camille?

920
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:24,079
- How did you get in here?
- I just bribed a bellhop.

921
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,041
What do you want?

922
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,877
- You said you couldn't wait to meet me?
- Yes, I did, but...

923
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:34,673
- Disappointed?
- No, but you must be.

924
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:38,218
Not at all.
You're drop dead gorgeous.

925
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,435
You're a genius.
All geniuses are gorgeous.

926
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:52,440
- You think I'm a genius?
- I knew it when I saw the Banff idea.

927
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:57,070
But the Syntonex deal
knocked me off my feet.

928
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,364
It was luminous, insightful,

929
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:01,658
brilliant!

930
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:07,330
And those notes! A woman waits a lifetime for them!
- I know.

931
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,125
Just sit there.

932
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:15,088
- I don't...
- Robert?

933
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:17,340
No, Camille.

934
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:20,135
Not the skirt, Camille.

935
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,681
La Perla.

936
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:29,102
You're a man of the world.
I want you, Robert.

937
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:33,982
I want your genius.
Feel me with your genius.

938
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:43,533
- My hips.
- I'll help you.

939
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,494
Stop that!

940
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:51,082
- Isn't that what you want?
- No, and you shouldn't either.

941
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:58,048
You're intelligent and beautiful.
You want to get ahead. Use your brain!

942
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:05,221
- I've never heard that before.
- I'm not surprised.

943
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:08,725
I'm shaking. Hold me!

944
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:13,521
No. I don't want to hold you.
Look, Camille,

945
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:18,109
it's not what's down here
that's important,

946
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,071
it's what's up here.

947
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:26,368
Think about it.
And get yourself together.

948
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:31,706
I'm pleased that you wanted to be
with me. Good evening.

949
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,711
What a man!

950
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:45,053
I really want to do business with you,
but I need the room number.

951
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:50,892
- Is he with anyone else?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

952
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:54,437
Mr. Frederick, what room is he in?

953
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:06,074
That's confidential.

954
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:11,121
Oh my God.

955
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:12,747
If you know what I'm...

956
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,418
Shit.

957
01:19:45,156 --> 01:19:47,198
Excuse me, Mr. Cutty,

958
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:51,786
Sorry to bother you. Frank
Peterson from Manchester Investments.

959
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:54,831
Walter Manchester and I

960
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:59,210
are having dinner
with Donald Fallon to discuss you.

961
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,463
Shit! Mr. Cutty,

962
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:10,638
I don't know
what Laurel Ayres said about me...

963
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:30,575
- My car.
- You're going so soon?

964
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:34,287
Frank, you stupid jerk.
Cutty's getting away.

965
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:38,082
Mr. Cutty needs his car right away.

966
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:42,337
Do you see him?

967
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:03,399
Mr. Cutty? Donald Fallon. Get in!

968
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,110
From the frying pan into the fryer.

969
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:17,580
The press treats you
like a rock star.

970
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:20,166
How about a good cigar?

971
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:25,421
- Thanks.
- I was going to a dinner. You were

972
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:28,174
to be the main topic of conversation.

973
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:32,345
I know. I ran into Frank Peterson.

974
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,681
Can we talk man to man?

975
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:39,060
- Man to man?
- Fine. I like that.

976
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,690
Hewlett Packard
wants to stay with Syntonex

977
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,402
and with you at the wheel,
they'd be fools not to.

978
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:49,571
Syntonex is Laurel's baby.

979
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:56,119
If she wants a baby,
she should find a man and have one.

980
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,209
Are you alright?

981
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:07,380
I suddenly have a bad taste
in my mouth. Is this a Cuban?

982
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:10,341
- No. Dominican.
- I don't smoke crap.

983
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:16,973
- I'm so sorry. It won't happen again.
- Amazing that you'd offer it to me.

984
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:21,978
Frank has made a deal.
You get Laurel to cooperate,

985
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:27,650
they'll accept a plea bargain.
She'll get probation

986
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:31,321
and lose her license. And you,

987
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:34,490
old friend,
you'll be totally in the clear.

988
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:37,410
That's a hell of a deal.

989
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:41,831
She'll be well compensated
and we'll end up big winners.

990
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,291
Pull over.

991
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:47,795
If you don't like the deal,

992
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:54,135
just make the SEC problem go away, and we'll forget it all.
- Goodbye.

993
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:58,973
Syntonex needs you.
And you need us. Think about it.

994
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,142
Next time they'll be Cubans.

995
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:04,520
Damn.

996
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,774
Looked like Brando.

997
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:15,323
Alright Mr. Cutty,
what are you up to?

998
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,163
Follow him.

999
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,301
Pull over.

1000
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:37,095
Hold it.

1001
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:48,481
Park it, cabby. We'll hang out here.

1002
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:00,535
Alright Cutty, you're going to die.

1003
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,705
You're going to die.

1004
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:11,254
- That doesn't make sense.
- Laurel went in and never came out?

1005
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:15,717
Cutty took Laurel's car to the Plaza
and went to her place

1006
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:20,596
- and never came out.
- After Laurel left this morning,

1007
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:25,351
- I knocked, and nothing!
- She went in but he came out...

1008
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:27,645
What?

1009
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:33,651
Nothing.

1010
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:37,113
They knew they were being followed
and gave you the slip.

1011
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:38,698
You know what?

1012
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:42,118
I say live and let live.

1013
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:44,412
Merry Christmas.

1014
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:48,249
You too, you son of a bitch.

1015
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:54,756
Even when I create the perfect man,
he stabs me in the back.

1016
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:59,093
- Do you want to talk?
- No, I'm going to kill him.

1017
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:02,805
Good idea,
but there's one small problem.

1018
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:05,683
What?
- How do you kill someone who doesn't exist.

1019
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:10,605
I don't know. But if he's dead,
he can't go to the SEC. That's good.

1020
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:18,571
- It's the nicest thing you've ever given me.
- I'm large like that.

1021
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:22,617
Wreckage of the craft was found
this morning off the Albanian coast.

1022
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,370
- With no signs of life...
- Oh my God.

1023
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:27,747
What?

1024
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:34,295
Mr. Cutty was on that ship. - He was not. Stop it.
- He was!

1025
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:37,799
Hello!

1026
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:40,885
He was on the ship.

1027
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:42,512
Of course.

1028
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:47,683
- Sure, Cutty and Calamaris are best friends.
- And now he's dead.

1029
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:52,438
Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh. It's perfect.

1030
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:56,484
Do you have a black dress?
- Yes. - Wear it, girl.

1031
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,528
I will.

1032
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:04,242
- ...the most generous man I ever knew.
- Excuse me, Miss Dugan.

1033
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:08,746
It's the worst thing that ever
happened to me. I'm crushed

1034
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:12,542
thinking that he's fish food now.

1035
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:16,963
And his body
will never be recovered...

1036
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:30,351
They've rescued everyone on the yacht
and Mr. Cutty wasn't even on board.

1037
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:32,019
He's not dead?

1038
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:37,817
It's a miracle!

1039
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,990
You had the watch inscribed?
Dear Robert, keep searching.

1040
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:48,744
- Who's J.?
- One of those women on his eternal search.

1041
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:54,250
- Oh, got power.
- Mr. Cutty's missing a foot.

1042
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:57,962
He had two when I dressed him.
Forget it.

1043
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:02,925
They'll think it came off
in the explosion. Really realistic.

1044
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:10,641
Speaking of which, shouldn't we
remove the hook from his head?

1045
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:12,935
Take it out!

1046
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:18,065
What?

1047
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:20,693
He moved.

1048
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:25,031
- Are we doing the right thing?
- With the hook?

1049
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:30,119
No, getting rid of Mr. Cutty.
It seems sort of drastic.

1050
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,413
No more drastic than creating him.

1051
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:36,417
I found it.

1052
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:37,835
What?

1053
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:40,046
Just throw it in.

1054
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,219
Release the brake?

1055
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:48,596
Pull the brake.

1056
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,812
Goodbye, Mr. Cutty.

1057
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:01,609
I'm going to miss him.

1058
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:12,870
It didn't blow up.

1059
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:21,295
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

1060
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:24,298
Well, maybe we should leave it be.

1061
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,468
- How are we supposed to explain it?

1062
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:30,930
We can't go down there.
It's just resting.

1063
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:34,433
Explosions don't rest.
Either they explode or they don't.

1064
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,191
See?

1065
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:51,492
- You alright?
- I'm great now.

1066
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:57,915
- Good, we don't do this for a living.
- Yeah, ain't it though? Alright,

1067
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:03,671
- let's get in the car and go home.
- We came in that car.

1068
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:13,055
I thought you were so efficient.
Didn't you figure everything out?

1069
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:18,519
- We blew up the damn car!
- You're telling me I have to walk?

1070
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,229
We just blew up the damn car!

1071
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,870
Listen, it's Christmas eve.

1072
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:40,750
The market is closing soon. There's
nothing I can do. You have to wait.

1073
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:07,109
Laurel Ayres? - Yeah, who are you?
- Police. - Is something wrong?

1074
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:11,447
You could say that. You're under
arrest for murdering Robert Cutty.

1075
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:16,702
What do you mean?
Are you kidding?

1076
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:20,706
What are you doing? Watch my hair!
I just had it done!

1077
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:26,170
Let's settle this quickly.
I need to light a candle for my dad.

1078
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:30,883
That's nice. Starting with the truth
saves time. Do you mind?

1079
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:36,680
No, please. You'll laugh
when I tell you this story.

1080
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:38,766
- You ready?
- Go.

1081
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:43,312
I couldn't have killed him, because
he doesn't exist. I made him up.

1082
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:47,775
If he doesn't exist,
then who's this at the Plaza?

1083
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:49,485
Oh, me.

1084
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:53,447
Dressed up like Robert Cutty.
A great picture, huh?

1085
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:58,035
Help me out here.
First you pretend there was a Cutty.

1086
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:03,916
Then you pretend to be a Cutty.
And then you pretended to kill him?

1087
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:08,170
He took all the credit for everything.
I saved an entire company.

1088
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:14,218
And they gave him a box of cigars. - You resented that.
- Absolutely!

1089
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:17,680
- You felt like you didn't exist.
- You know it!

1090
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:22,685
If Cutty was alive, it wasn't going to change. So you killed him.
- Right!

1091
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:25,020
Blew him up in the car.

1092
01:31:25,564 --> 01:31:28,315
Dead as a doornail. Poof, he was gone.

1093
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:33,529
- And how did you feel?
- Good. Like I knew that it would.

1094
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:35,948
- Thank you. Yes!
- Ms. Ayres.

1095
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:41,912
Wait! I've seen Kojak.
I know what you just did.

1096
01:31:42,372 --> 01:31:43,706
I didn't kill the guy.

1097
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:48,627
Just call my secretary, Sally Dugan.
She'll explain it all.

1098
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,254
She was my accomplice.

1099
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:54,884
Not my accomplice,
she's accomplished, I meant to say.

1100
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,219
She was my helper...

1101
01:31:57,762 --> 01:32:01,098
She can tell you everything
you need to know.

1102
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,851
Sally Dugan? We'll do that.

1103
01:32:18,909 --> 01:32:20,659
What happened?

1104
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:25,706
They arrested me in front of my family
at Christmas Eve dinner.

1105
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:30,211
- They didn't believe you either.
- No, I'm an accomplice.

1106
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:35,174
- I'm really sorry.
- It's not your fault.

1107
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:38,302
No, it's Cutty again.

1108
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:42,806
You okay?

1109
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:48,395
- Yeah. I have to go to the bathroom.
- Isn't there one here?

1110
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:53,526
Yeah, but did you see it?
- No. - I couldn't.

1111
01:32:53,944 --> 01:32:57,238
- This could be a long wait.
- Oh my gosh.

1112
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:05,329
Frank, the tree is almost done.

1113
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:09,833
- Just a second!
- I'm in the holiday spirits.

1114
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:14,046
A couple of more minutes.

1115
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:17,091
I've unwrapped your present.

1116
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:21,095
And I'm getting cold!

1117
01:33:24,266 --> 01:33:27,893
Keep your chestnuts roasting.

1118
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:33,440
Santa's making sure it's going to be
a very merry Christmas.

1119
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,238
And an amazing New Year.

1120
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:43,576
Mr. Manchester...

1121
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:50,082
- Frank Peterson will answer everything.
- Alright. Here it is.

1122
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:54,169
Robert called me after the Plaza
incident to set up a new meeting.

1123
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:58,007
On his way, he was car-jacked.

1124
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:01,385
He was robbed.
Wallet, watch, jewelry, everything.

1125
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:08,976
I don't know about witnesses.
The carjacker obviously had enemies.

1126
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:13,939
- How is he now?
- He was understandably shaken.

1127
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:19,194
He had to leave New York, so he called
me and we left for Europe at once.

1128
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:22,323
...CNN, Robert Cutty is alive.

1129
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:25,451
He was the victim of a carjacking.

1130
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:31,624
- Call me.
- Okay I'll call you.

1131
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:37,921
- Your charges have been dropped, too.
- You finally believed us?

1132
01:34:38,298 --> 01:34:41,342
The guy you said doesn't exist?

1133
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:45,012
- Son of a bitch!
- We have a sworn affidavit

1134
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,931
from Frank Peterson, saying that Cutty

1135
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:50,851
is alive and on vacation in France.

1136
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:58,817
I don't know.
I thought she'd be happier.

1137
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:07,451
Please Laurel. Don't do this to me.
3 days! This is not healthy.

1138
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:11,330
I'm going to have a heart attack.

1139
01:35:16,086 --> 01:35:18,462
Our top stories in business:

1140
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:22,966
The SEC has cleared
Robert Cutty on all charges.

1141
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:28,931
Walter Manchester announced the merger
of his and Cutty's companies.

1142
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:31,475
As expected,
Frank Peterson was named president.

1143
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:36,021
Laurel, it's Sally.
This is the 12th time I've called.

1144
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:39,483
Pick up the phone and talk to me.

1145
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:44,446
We're all worried sick
about you. Just stop this.

1146
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:47,408
Get up and pick up the phone!

1147
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:51,370
The SEC has suspended the license

1148
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:54,581
of Laurel Ayres,
Cutty's former associate.

1149
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:08,804
We are talking to woman,
expecting but abandoned,

1150
01:36:09,222 --> 01:36:11,557
by wealthy, but elusive fathers.

1151
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:17,187
When's the baby due?
- Late July. - Does Mr. Cutty know?

1152
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:19,523
He won't return my calls.

1153
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,234
I love Robert Cutty.

1154
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:28,741
All I want is to meet him
to talk about our son's future.

1155
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:32,870
- Talk about your immaculate conception.
- Excuse me.

1156
01:36:33,455 --> 01:36:38,751
He doesn't return your calls?
So what if he's rich, sue his ass!

1157
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:41,253
Am I right?

1158
01:36:45,175 --> 01:36:49,762
Answer the door. Alright, Laurel.
I'm sorry, but we're coming in.

1159
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,973
I hate to do this, but here it comes.

1160
01:36:56,644 --> 01:37:00,606
- Thank you so much. Thanks.
- Laurel?

1161
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:05,319
- I'll take it from here. Thanks.
- Thanks, honey.

1162
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:07,863
Oh, what a mess.

1163
01:37:08,323 --> 01:37:09,573
Are you crazy?

1164
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:11,992
Go away.

1165
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,453
My gosh!

1166
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:18,040
Look at this.
Your door is broken.

1167
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:21,293
My, haven't you been busy.

1168
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:23,337
For goodness sake.

1169
01:37:24,923 --> 01:37:28,300
You're driving us all crazy.
People are worried sick about you.

1170
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:33,347
Now you can go and tell them
I'm fine. I'm stuck in my own world.

1171
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:37,351
My couch, my TV,
and lots of delivery people. Go away.

1172
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:44,233
A shame to let them take away
the house your dad worked so hard for.

1173
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:49,321
- Leave him out of this.
- You didn't bother to light a candle.

1174
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:53,242
Where were we this year?
In jail, were we not?

1175
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:57,454
- Now you're not. Get up and go do it now!
- No!

1176
01:37:57,956 --> 01:37:59,331
Get dressed and go!

1177
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:04,503
Don't fight.

1178
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:09,424
- We're going to light a candle...
- Go home!

1179
01:38:09,968 --> 01:38:14,680
Oh my gosh.
First thing, brush your teeth!

1180
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:42,082
Thank you, Sally.

1181
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:48,630
- What are we going to do?
- Go home and go to bed.

1182
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:51,967
I mean about the future. Yours, mine.

1183
01:38:52,385 --> 01:38:56,263
Don't tie yours up with mine.
I'm done. Frank's got Cutty.

1184
01:38:56,723 --> 01:39:01,018
Snap out of it. Frank's got Cutty.
So what? Good riddance.

1185
01:39:01,477 --> 01:39:04,688
He's a bunch of trouble.
- You're right. - Right.

1186
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:08,108
By the way, you'll love this.

1187
01:39:08,568 --> 01:39:13,405
- The Peabody Club is making Cutty a member.
- Really?

1188
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:18,744
They're voting him Business Man of the Year.
- As they should!

1189
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:21,413
Nobody had a year like Cutty.

1190
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:24,958
- It was my year. Nobody had a year like me.
- I know.

1191
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:29,004
- Your name should be on that plaque.
- Yeah, it should.

1192
01:39:30,214 --> 01:39:36,637
There's going to be a big dinner
with chicken and fruit cocktail.

1193
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:38,805
And Frank.

1194
01:39:39,265 --> 01:39:41,600
He's accepting the award for Cutty.

1195
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,770
How is it possible? I mean

1196
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:48,941
he got my promotion.
He gets Cutty, he... - You know

1197
01:39:49,442 --> 01:39:52,611
as long as
Frank's got Cutty, he's got you, too.

1198
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:04,247
Yeah, because I'm Cutty.

1199
01:40:10,546 --> 01:40:12,172
You know what?

1200
01:40:13,508 --> 01:40:14,508
Yeah?

1201
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:20,973
- Call me!
- I'm going to.

1202
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:31,358
Thank you very much.

1203
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:36,738
Gentlemen, good evening.
Tonight we welcome our newest member

1204
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:42,119
and winner of the Peabody
Business Man of the Year award.

1205
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,250
Pardon me, ladies.

1206
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:53,296
Pardon me, ladies.
Up the stairs, gentlemen.

1207
01:40:56,634 --> 01:40:59,052
I have some very bad news.

1208
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:04,516
I've just heard that Robert Cutty
will not be here this evening.

1209
01:41:06,519 --> 01:41:10,272
There's a typhoon in Hong Kong,
so his plane is grounded.

1210
01:41:10,732 --> 01:41:14,026
I spoke with Bob,
and he was very disappointed.

1211
01:41:14,527 --> 01:41:17,529
He asked me
to convey his deepest regret

1212
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:21,700
and sincere gratitude for being
welcomed into this illustrious club.

1213
01:41:22,577 --> 01:41:25,912
And for this prestigious award.

1214
01:41:27,165 --> 01:41:28,498
On behalf of

1215
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:34,046
my close friend and colleague,
Robert Cutty, I'd like to...

1216
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:38,050
- Mr. Cutty is here.
- No, he's not.

1217
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:43,346
- He's here.
- I'd like to...

1218
01:41:56,778 --> 01:41:58,695
Cutty made it. He's here.

1219
01:41:59,489 --> 01:42:00,697
I don't believe it.

1220
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:17,631
- You won't get away with it.
- Watch me.

1221
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:22,552
Donald, still smoking
those cheap cigars?

1222
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:25,889
Nice to see you, Robert.

1223
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:31,144
Walter, my new partner. Frank, no!
I like it when you're close.

1224
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:33,396
Without you, I wouldn't be here.

1225
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:38,985
Gentlemen, I took the Concorde
and beat out that damned typhoon.

1226
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:44,658
It's wonderful to be accepted
into an exclusive club.

1227
01:42:45,201 --> 01:42:48,411
It makes a man feel,
well, damned good.

1228
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:55,502
You knew nothing about me,

1229
01:42:55,962 --> 01:43:00,048
yet you accepted me
as one of your own. I find it amazing.

1230
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:04,427
My work spoke for itself and now
I'm Business Man of the Year.

1231
01:43:08,057 --> 01:43:10,642
But in the words of Groucho Marx,

1232
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:14,646
I don't want to be part of a club
that would have me as a member.

1233
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:22,821
We need to encourage our young people.
I mean to share this award

1234
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:26,158
with the young person at my left.

1235
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:30,495
For his hard work.
He's been my inspiration.

1236
01:43:32,415 --> 01:43:34,082
I really owe it all to him.

1237
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:36,376
Take a bow.

1238
01:43:55,938 --> 01:43:59,441
- Holy shit!
- Figures.

1239
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:01,693
You know, gentlemen,

1240
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:07,365
there's something about exclusivity.

1241
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:11,119
The word means to exclude.

1242
01:44:11,913 --> 01:44:14,039
As I thought it would in my case.

1243
01:44:17,585 --> 01:44:22,797
I played by the rules,
I worked really hard,

1244
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:24,841
and was very honest.

1245
01:44:26,052 --> 01:44:27,052
I know

1246
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:32,766
that I didn't have
the right image for this club

1247
01:44:33,726 --> 01:44:37,896
and would never have it.
Image is a funny thing.

1248
01:44:40,066 --> 01:44:45,695
Under the right image might be
the wrong one. Under the wrong one

1249
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:57,249
might be the real Robert Cutty.

1250
01:44:57,667 --> 01:44:59,000
Far out.

1251
01:45:04,924 --> 01:45:09,344
Possibly the man serving you
coffee or offering you a cigar.

1252
01:45:09,929 --> 01:45:14,391
It could be your busboy
or your waiter. You never know.

1253
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:19,771
I want to congratulate you
for inducting into the Peabody Club

1254
01:45:20,231 --> 01:45:22,440
your first woman member.

1255
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,867
Thank you.

1256
01:46:09,238 --> 01:46:11,323
Alright, Laurel!

1257
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:18,496
Next week we'll do lunch, okay?

1258
01:46:26,714 --> 01:46:28,423
It's about time!

1259
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:45,774
- You were fabulous.
- We did it.

1260
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:15,720
I used to think
that doing business meant

1261
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:19,099
being insensitive and cruel.

1262
01:47:20,893 --> 01:47:24,521
Why is it that men
always hurt the ones they love most?

1263
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:31,903
I've done a lot of soul-searching
and I feel reborn, liberated.

1264
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:37,242
I've really gotten in touch
with my feminine side.

1265
01:47:38,202 --> 01:47:44,207
I feel ready to change
into the kind of caring,

1266
01:47:44,667 --> 01:47:48,878
feeling executive
you want for this company.

1267
01:47:49,255 --> 01:47:52,549
I only ask for the chance
to prove that to you.

1268
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:58,471
It's really wonderful.

1269
01:47:58,973 --> 01:48:03,893
It's remarkable
how people can change.

1270
01:48:05,271 --> 01:48:06,438
However,

1271
01:48:06,856 --> 01:48:10,608
knowing my associate as I do,

1272
01:48:10,985 --> 01:48:13,945
I'm afraid
it would really piss her off.

1273
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:31,929
I'm going to perpetrate a whammy!

1273
01:53:32,305 --> 01:54:32,614
