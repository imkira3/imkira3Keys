1
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:44,477
<i>Once upon a time, a long time ago,</i>

2
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,148
<i>a king and queen had a
beautiful daughter named Fiona.</i>

3
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,025
<i>But she was possessed
by a terrible curse.</i>

4
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:55,822
<i>By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.</i>

5
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,741
<i>Only true love's kiss
could lift her curse.</i>

6
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:03,079
<i>So Fiona waited in a tower,
guarded by a dragon, until the day</i>

7
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:05,957
<i>when her true love would arrive.</i>

8
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,459
<i>But as the days turned into years,</i>

9
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:12,589
<i>the King and Queen were forced
to resort to more desperate measures.</i>

10
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:06,226
Whoa, there.

11
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:09,312
I don't know about this, Lillian.

12
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,816
Fairy Godmother said only true love's
kiss could break Fiona's curse.

13
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:18,238
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.

14
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,532
Besides, he does come
highly recommended by King Midas.

15
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,329
But to put our daughter's life
in the hands of this... person?

16
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:31,209
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...

17
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:33,753
Rumpelstiltskin!

18
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,133
Mrs Highness.

19
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,177
How do you do?

20
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,847
Down, Fifi. Get down!

21
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,352
As you can see, everything's in order.

22
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,231
So you'll put an end
to our daughter's curse?

23
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:57,735
And, in return, you sign the kingdom
of Far Far Away over to me.

24
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:07,954
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?

25
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:11,666
Fiona has been locked away
in that tower far too long.

26
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:13,918
It's not like she's getting any younger.

27
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:16,754
But to sign over our entire kingdom?

28
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:19,841
Well, if your kingdom's worth
more to you than your daughter...

29
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:23,636
Nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter.

30
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,641
Jump, Fifi, jump!

31
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,651
Just sign it and all your problems
will disappear.

32
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,664
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!

33
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,171
Who saved her?

34
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:01,716
No one would have guessed
that an ogre named Shrek,

35
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:03,968
whose roar was feared
throughout the land,

36
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:06,804
would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.

37
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:09,932
True love's kiss led to marriage
and ogre babies!

38
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,227
The kingdom of Far Far Away
was finally at peace.

39
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:17,774
Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!

40
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,153
Sir? You're gonna
have to pay for that.

41
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,074
Maybe we could make a deal
for it, little boy?

42
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:29,952
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?

43
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,876
Nobody needs your deals
anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!

44
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:46,386
I wish that ogre was never born!

45
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,650
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!

46
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:04,570
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

47
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:09,242
Better out than in.

48
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:11,160
That's my line.

49
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:14,288
Did my little Fergus make a...

50
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:17,708
...big, grownup ogre stink?!

51
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:21,087
Oh, that's diabolical!

52
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:26,426
And on your left, the lovable lug
that showed us you don't have to

53
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,970
change your undies
to change the world!

54
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,306
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.

55
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:35,768
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!

56
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:40,064
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge,
through the loop...

57
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:42,608
...and finally, into the castle.

58
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,323
Play date!

59
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,499
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.

60
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,710
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

61
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:01,919
Happily...

62
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:03,546
- Ever...
- After.

63
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,512
Look! A shooting star!

64
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,725
So, what did you wish for?

65
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:17,977
That every day could be like this one.

66
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,604
Come here, you.

67
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,951
Morning, Daddy.

68
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,244
Morning.

69
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:38,498
Better out than in.

70
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,667
Did my little Fergus make a...

71
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,048
Cute. Real cute.

72
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,009
This lovable lug taught us

73
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,095
you don't have to change
your undies to change the world!

74
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,181
Play date!

75
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,394
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!

76
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:03,523
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

77
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,690
- Happily...
- Ever...

78
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:05,900
After?

79
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,863
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.

80
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:15,868
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...

81
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,204
- Play date!
- No!

82
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,290
Outhouse again!

83
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,542
Come on.

84
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,630
Undies!

85
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,550
Outhouse!

86
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,843
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...

87
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:34,470
- Happily...
- Ever...

88
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:35,888
After.

89
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,940
Roar.

90
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,658
Nice landing, baby.

91
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,202
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.

92
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:26,290
Happy birthday, ninos!
Vamos a la fiesta!

93
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:29,251
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!

94
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,047
Mr Shrek, would you
sign our pitchforks?

95
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:34,298
And our torches?

96
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,175
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!

97
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,177
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!

98
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,262
A real ogre?

99
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:54,735
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!

100
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:58,030
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.

101
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:02,660
Why does being your best friend entail
me doing everything I don't want to do?

102
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:05,162
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.

103
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,580
Excuse me, Mr Shrek?

104
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:08,916
Could you do that
ogre roar of yours for my son?

105
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:10,584
He's a big, big fan.

106
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:11,877
Do the roar.

107
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,839
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.

108
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:17,007
- Do the roar.
- Honey?

109
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:18,509
Why don't you go check on the cake?

110
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:22,054
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.

111
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,222
Hold still.

112
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,391
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.

113
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,436
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!

114
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:29,979
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!

115
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:31,981
Your cake. Voilà!

116
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:36,318
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!

117
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:38,863
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.

118
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,282
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!

119
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,033
I'm in a great mood, actually.

120
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:46,078
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!

121
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,413
As long as you're not doing anything,

122
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,039
how about one of those
famous Shrek roars?

123
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:51,751
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.

124
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,462
An ogre only roars when he's angry.

125
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,714
You don't want to see me angry, do you?

126
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:58,174
Do it.

127
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,469
Hold it together. Just hold it together.

128
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:03,721
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.

129
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,181
Oh, good.

130
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:08,851
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.

131
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,603
- You licked it!
- No.

132
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,647
Just because you're an ogre,
doesn't mean you have to eat like one.

133
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:16,108
Looks like you forgot the candles!

134
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,527
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.

135
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:19,987
Watch the cake?

136
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,782
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.

137
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,033
- Ya.
- What?

138
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:25,451
No, don't cry.

139
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,120
Hey! I believe you
promised my son a roar.

140
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,705
- Do the roar.
- Roar.

141
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:32,166
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.

142
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:35,169
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.

143
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:37,755
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!

144
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:40,633
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?

145
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,676
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.

146
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:44,011
No, I ate them.

147
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,889
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!

148
00:11:47,057 --> 00:11:50,059
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?

149
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:52,186
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.

150
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,648
We need the cake!

151
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,318
Cake! Cake! Cake!

152
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:15,459
I love you, Daddy.

153
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:18,337
Everybody, I have found another cake!

154
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,715
Shrek? Are you OK?

155
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:52,663
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...

156
00:12:52,831 --> 00:12:56,166
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.

157
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:59,336
Is this really how you want
to remember the kids' first birthday?

158
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:03,507
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?

159
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:05,718
Let's talk about this
after the party, at home.

160
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,596
You mean that roadside
attraction we live in?

161
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:13,267
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!

162
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:17,605
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!

163
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:22,067
OK, OK, maybe you're not
the ogre you used to be.

164
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,944
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.

165
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:27,781
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.

166
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:30,242
You spent half your life in a palace.

167
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,953
And the other half
locked away in a tower.

168
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:38,417
Look, all I want is for things to go
back to the way they used to be!

169
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:43,339
Back when villagers were afraid of me,
and I could take a mud bath in peace.

170
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:47,092
When I could do what I wanted,
when I wanted to do it!

171
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,638
Back when the world made sense!

172
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,474
You mean back before you
rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?

173
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:55,017
Exactly!

174
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:05,110
Shrek, you have
three beautiful children,

175
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,446
a wife who loves you,

176
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:11,659
friends who adore you.
You have everything.

177
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,499
Why is it the only person
who can't see that is you?

178
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,980
That's just great.

179
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,407
If she thinks I'm gonna
slink back there and apologize,

180
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:54,827
she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.

181
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:58,831
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize
for acting like one.

182
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:03,335
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!

183
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,254
Please, help!

184
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:07,297
Please, help!

185
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,466
I'm stuck! Help!

186
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:11,468
Oh, please, help!

187
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:14,430
Someone, anyone! Help me!

188
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:18,100
The pain! I can see
a bright light. A tunnel!

189
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,728
Grandma? Is that you?

190
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:22,271
Yeah, it's me, Granny.

191
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:26,025
An ogre! Please, Mr Ogre,
please don't eat me!

192
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,735
I'm not gonna eat you.

193
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:31,196
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?

194
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,199
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.

195
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,785
Look, move out or get crushed.

196
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:38,954
So you're not gonna eat me?

197
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:43,959
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl
of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

198
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,338
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?

199
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:49,506
Nowhere.

200
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:52,342
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.

201
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,014
But, seriously,
let me give you a ride. I insist.

202
00:15:57,182 --> 00:16:01,560
Come on. It's the least I can do
after all you've done for me.

203
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:04,646
I got a hot rat cooking.

204
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:10,277
All right! Can I interest you
in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?

205
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:13,405
A liquid libation
to ease that frustration?

206
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:17,868
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.

207
00:16:18,787 --> 00:16:22,790
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about. "

208
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,543
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.

209
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:30,047
To live the life of an ogre...
no worries, no responsibilities.

210
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:32,966
You are free to pillage
and terrorize as you please.

211
00:16:33,134 --> 00:16:36,428
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?

212
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:42,184
Sometimes I wish I had just one day
to feel like a real ogre again.

213
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:43,477
Why didn't you say so?

214
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,814
Magical transactions are my specialty!

215
00:16:46,981 --> 00:16:50,692
Great. Next to mimes,
magicians are my favourite people.

216
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:53,153
Hold on.

217
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:56,490
"King for a Month. "
"Knight for a Week. "

218
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:01,870
Ogre for a day.

219
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:05,541
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.

220
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:06,750
You'll be, like, "Roar!"

221
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:10,504
And the villagers will be, like, "Get
away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"

222
00:17:10,672 --> 00:17:14,049
It would be just like the good old days,
when your swamp was your castle.

223
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:19,847
- When the world made sense.
- All right, what's the catch?

224
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:23,684
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.

225
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,936
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.

226
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:29,106
All right, I knew it.
So what do you want?

227
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:31,108
- A day.
- A day.

228
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:32,317
Rat's done!

229
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:37,030
To make the magic work, you gotta
give something to get something.

230
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:40,117
In this case, you gotta
give a day to get a day. That's all.

231
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:42,995
I can't just pick up
and leave my family.

232
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,832
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.

233
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,834
No one will even know you're gone.

234
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:54,798
And by the time this day is up,
you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.

235
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,759
Still, I don't know.

236
00:17:57,927 --> 00:18:01,471
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.

237
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:04,141
Do you like white meat or dark meat?

238
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:08,395
So what day would I have to give up?

239
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:11,440
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.

240
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:14,026
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?

241
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,612
A day some meddling oaf
stuck his nose where it didn't belong

242
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:18,405
destroying your business
and ruining your life?!

243
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:23,535
Just for an example.

244
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,454
How about the day I met Donkey?

245
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:28,123
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.

246
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,292
I don't know who that is.

247
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:33,712
I know. What about a day
you wouldn't even remember?

248
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,089
Like a day when you were a baby.

249
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:41,511
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.

250
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,058
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.

251
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:50,103
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.

252
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:53,899
I guess there's nothing wrong
with wanting a little time for myself.

253
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,609
Just 24 tiny little hours.

254
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:57,861
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!

255
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:00,280
I never needed to ask
for anyone's permission before.

256
00:19:00,448 --> 00:19:03,116
So why start now?

257
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:13,252
Go on, Shrek.

258
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,962
Sign it!

259
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:17,506
Go on, Shrek.

260
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,175
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!

261
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,178
You signed it.

262
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:26,139
So, tell me. What happens now?

263
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:27,975
Have a nice day.

264
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,370
I think I fell on my keys.

265
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:50,122
There are 40 children in that shoe,

266
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,833
which is why the weasel
goes pop to this very day.

267
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:54,042
Oh, great.

268
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,712
As we head over the river
and through the woods...

269
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:57,921
Ogre!

270
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,196
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!

271
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:19,544
This is the part where you run away!

272
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:43,610
Sure is great to be wanted again.

273
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:46,446
Nice one.

274
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:56,498
Fiona?

275
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:08,176
Oh, no.

276
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,817
My home.

277
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:26,486
Fiona!

278
00:22:28,656 --> 00:22:31,491
Fiona! Are you in there?!

279
00:23:09,197 --> 00:23:11,364
All right, Rumpel!

280
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:14,534
This wasn't part of the deal!

281
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:19,372
Rumpel!

282
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,812
Ogre!

283
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:47,234
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!

284
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:50,445
Who are you?!

285
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:52,614
What are you doing in my swamp?

286
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,081
Looks like a troublemaker!

287
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:14,928
Spread 'em!

288
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:19,266
Nice job, ladies!

289
00:24:26,816 --> 00:24:31,111
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!

290
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,613
You have the right to shut your mouth!

291
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:56,970
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?

292
00:24:57,805 --> 00:24:59,139
Donkey!

293
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:10,984
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?

294
00:25:11,152 --> 00:25:14,321
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.

295
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:23,830
I'm driving,
so I'm in charge of the music.

296
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:27,834
Will you witches make up your mind?

297
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:40,221
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?

298
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:43,558
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me
in trouble and I need this job.

299
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:45,393
I am not going back to work
for Old MacDonald.

300
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:48,355
Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That's what I said.

301
00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:52,233
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?

302
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:55,236
Look, I think you have me confused
with some other talking donkey.

303
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:56,780
I've never seen you before in my life.

304
00:25:56,947 --> 00:25:59,532
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!

305
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,868
And how do you
know my name anyway?

306
00:26:02,036 --> 00:26:04,913
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?

307
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:06,998
A donkey and an ogre friends?

308
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,417
That's the most
ridiculous thing I ever heard!

309
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:14,756
Can you at least tell me
where they're taking me?

310
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:18,093
To the same place they take
every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.

311
00:26:18,886 --> 00:26:21,971
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!

312
00:26:29,397 --> 00:26:32,107
Oh, no.

313
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:46,079
It's time to crumble!

314
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:50,583
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!

315
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:51,793
Yeah!

316
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,297
Gingy?

317
00:27:00,261 --> 00:27:02,095
Gingy snap!

318
00:27:04,682 --> 00:27:05,724
There's one!

319
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,600
Disgusting, filthy ogre!

320
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:09,519
Hideous monster!

321
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:11,312
Filthy, filthy creature!

322
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,773
Disgusting creature!

323
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,551
Move it!

324
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:01,404
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.

325
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:04,741
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard
on mine, Captain Crazy!

326
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:43,696
Mr Stiltskin?

327
00:28:45,741 --> 00:28:47,867
You got another customer.

328
00:28:48,244 --> 00:28:50,745
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr Stiltskin.

329
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:52,747
Bring me my business wig.

330
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:55,124
Mr Stiltskin, please!

331
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:00,505
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!

332
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:04,050
Go away! Terms are
in the details, balsa boy.

333
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:06,970
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!

334
00:29:07,555 --> 00:29:08,888
Stiltskin!

335
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:11,349
Shrek!

336
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,769
There he is!

337
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:17,188
So close!

338
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,900
Have I been waiting for you!

339
00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:24,279
Ladies, this is the guy

340
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:27,824
that made all of this possible!

341
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:31,452
So, tell me, how are you
enjoying your day?

342
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,747
All right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?

343
00:29:34,915 --> 00:29:38,084
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.

344
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:42,046
Thanks to you, the King and Queen
signed their kingdom over to me.

345
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,631
They would never do that.

346
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:48,428
They would if I promised them
all their problems would disappear.

347
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,265
And then they disappeared!

348
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:02,984
They would have done anything

349
00:30:03,152 --> 00:30:05,278
if they thought it would
end their daughter's curse.

350
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:07,822
I ended Fiona's curse!

351
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,326
How could you when you never existed?

352
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:14,495
You better start making sense,
you dirty little man!

353
00:30:14,663 --> 00:30:16,956
Here, let me spell it out for you!

354
00:30:17,124 --> 00:30:21,461
You gave me a day from your past,
a day you couldn't even remember.

355
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:25,840
A day when you were
an innocent, mindless little baby.

356
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,054
You took the day I was born.

357
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:34,223
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.

358
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:37,936
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin,
because when this day is up...

359
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,813
But you haven't heard the best part.

360
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:46,694
Since you were never born, once
this day comes to an end, so will you.

361
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:52,367
Where's Fiona?

362
00:30:53,077 --> 00:30:54,285
Where's my family?

363
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:57,664
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?

364
00:30:57,831 --> 00:31:00,375
You see, you were never born.

365
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,669
You never met Fiona.

366
00:31:02,836 --> 00:31:06,422
Your kids don't exist.

367
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:12,512
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?

368
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:16,766
Looks like you got
exactly what you wanted!

369
00:31:17,768 --> 00:31:21,020
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!

370
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:24,315
Get him, witches!

371
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:38,079
You know what'd help morale
around here? Flip-flop Fridays.

372
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:40,915
Feet be comfortable
with the breeze on your toes.

373
00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:49,590
Come on, girls!

374
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:03,938
Lock all the doors,
you worthless witches! Do it!

375
00:32:06,734 --> 00:32:08,359
I'll be right back, Donkey!

376
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:11,946
I don't know you! I don't know him!

377
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:33,426
I'm glad I'm not you.

378
00:32:38,098 --> 00:32:39,432
Help me! Help!

379
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:41,642
Help!

380
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,652
No, not my pretty ball!

381
00:32:56,116 --> 00:32:57,950
Watch out!

382
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:11,130
Wolfie?

383
00:33:11,298 --> 00:33:13,633
My angry wig.

384
00:33:22,184 --> 00:33:25,645
Help! I've been kidnapped
by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!

385
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:27,230
Donkey! Get off of me!

386
00:33:27,397 --> 00:33:30,316
Watch it with your pointy hooves!

387
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:38,991
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!

388
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:41,160
I'm being ass-napped!

389
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:42,954
Animal cruelty! Help!

390
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,206
You need to calm down!

391
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:46,541
I'm your friend.

392
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,377
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

393
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:52,213
Good. I'm gonna let go...

394
00:33:52,381 --> 00:33:54,841
...right... now.

395
00:33:55,008 --> 00:33:57,552
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!

396
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:00,179
Donkey! You've got to trust me.

397
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:02,932
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...

398
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,184
Because...

399
00:34:08,856 --> 00:34:10,189
OK.

400
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,273
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?

401
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:28,476
I've never seen an ogre cry.

402
00:35:33,982 --> 00:35:35,691
I'm not crying.

403
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:37,902
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.

404
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,988
Just thinking about my grandma,
or thinking about baby kittens,

405
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:45,493
or my grandma kissing a baby kitten,
or a little baby grandma kitten.

406
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:49,789
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!

407
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:51,832
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.

408
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,834
It's none of my business
why you're upset.

409
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:56,170
By the way, why are you upset?

410
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:59,215
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.

411
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:01,676
You signed up for one of them
time-shares, huh?

412
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:04,512
No. I signed this.

413
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,682
You should never sign a contract
with Rumpelstiltskin!

414
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:09,183
Yeah, I got that.

415
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:11,352
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.

416
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,854
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...

417
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,149
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.

418
00:36:17,317 --> 00:36:18,484
Used to be, you had to guess his name,

419
00:36:18,652 --> 00:36:20,569
but now everybody knows
who Rumpelstiltskin is.

420
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:22,363
Donkey, I've read the fine print.

421
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:24,865
There's nothing
about an exit clause in here.

422
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:26,951
Well, you didn't expect him
to make it easy for you.

423
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,370
Here, let me show you how it's done.

424
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:31,038
I didn't spend all that time
around them witches

425
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:32,873
without picking up a few tricks.

426
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:35,251
Your tiny, little ogre brain
couldn't begin to comprehend

427
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:37,712
the complexity
of my polygonic foldability skills.

428
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:39,130
What are you doing?

429
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:42,383
Hey, I can't get my origami on
unless you back off.

430
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:45,845
Thank you. OK, here's what you
gotta do. You fold this piece here,

431
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:48,389
make this letter match up here,
bring this corner here,

432
00:36:48,557 --> 00:36:52,727
and if you do it just right,
it will show you what to do. There!

433
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:55,229
"Try Lou's Bliss. "

434
00:36:58,233 --> 00:36:59,275
Who's Lou?

435
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:01,235
Give me that!

436
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:08,617
"True Love's Kiss. "

437
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:13,414
You have to take me to dinner first.

438
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:17,418
"According to fairy tale law,
if not fully satisfied,

439
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:21,088
true love's kiss will render
this contract null and void. "

440
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:24,759
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!

441
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:29,722
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!

442
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,808
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?

443
00:37:34,436 --> 00:37:35,895
Well, that's just it, you see.

444
00:37:36,563 --> 00:37:37,938
I don't know.

445
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:40,274
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.

446
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:42,777
So... where did you leave her last?

447
00:37:43,445 --> 00:37:45,613
The last time I saw her,

448
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:48,449
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.

449
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:53,579
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?

450
00:37:53,747 --> 00:37:56,332
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!

451
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,626
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!

452
00:37:58,794 --> 00:38:00,711
They keep dragons in there!

453
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:04,006
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!

454
00:38:04,174 --> 00:38:07,093
I'm gonna just hang back here
and find us some breakfast!

455
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,146
Fiona!

456
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:56,016
Oh, no.

457
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:09,238
If I didn't save Fiona...

458
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,909
...then who did?

459
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:29,258
This is the favour Fiona was
supposed to give me on the day we met.

460
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:32,928
It's a symbol of our love.

461
00:39:33,763 --> 00:39:34,889
Now smell it!

462
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:36,932
Hey, man, get that dirty
favour out of my face!

463
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,644
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife,

464
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,397
so stop complaining and start smelling.

465
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:45,024
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!

466
00:39:45,192 --> 00:39:46,901
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?

467
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:49,487
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!

468
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:52,406
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog,
not Donkey!

469
00:39:52,574 --> 00:39:53,949
And another thing...

470
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:56,410
Wait a minute.

471
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:58,496
I think I got something.

472
00:39:59,122 --> 00:40:01,415
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.

473
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:03,209
Luscious and tasty.

474
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:05,920
Hey! That's my wife
you're talking about.

475
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:08,589
Donkey!

476
00:40:12,594 --> 00:40:14,678
Yeah! Waffles!

477
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:17,806
And I thought the Waffle Fairy
was just a bedtime story.

478
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,936
Sticky stacks of golden,
syrupy deliciousness!

479
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:24,271
Donkey! Don't eat that!

480
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:28,567
There's a stack of freshly made waffles
in the middle of the forest.

481
00:40:28,735 --> 00:40:30,611
Don't you find that
a wee bit suspicious?

482
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:33,531
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?

483
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,658
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.

484
00:40:35,825 --> 00:40:39,870
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.

485
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:41,830
You did.

486
00:40:48,964 --> 00:40:50,089
Look out!

487
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:54,218
Donkey!

488
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:56,804
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

489
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:00,057
Donkey.

490
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,144
Help! Help me!

491
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:07,064
Help, Shrek! Help!

492
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,047
Watch your head.

493
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:33,591
Hey, it's a new guy!

494
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,884
Look at him, all dressed up
in his Sunday vest.

495
00:41:36,052 --> 00:41:37,803
He's really tiny, isn't he?

496
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:40,055
Yeah. Fate has delivered us
a comrade-in-arms

497
00:41:40,223 --> 00:41:41,849
and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!

498
00:41:42,017 --> 00:41:43,976
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!

499
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,774
- Hey!
- Here you go.

500
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:58,866
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?

501
00:41:59,034 --> 00:42:02,620
We fight for freedom
and ogres everywhere!

502
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:13,714
I didn't know we could do that.

503
00:42:13,882 --> 00:42:16,383
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!

504
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:21,013
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.

505
00:42:21,181 --> 00:42:23,599
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.

506
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:25,934
Trust me, you don't want
to eat this one.

507
00:42:26,102 --> 00:42:28,145
I go down smooth,
but come out fighting!

508
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:30,397
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.

509
00:42:30,565 --> 00:42:31,649
Your dinner is my friend!

510
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,942
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!

511
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,111
- She's back.
- There she is.

512
00:42:53,963 --> 00:42:55,047
Fiona!

513
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,259
I'm so happy I found you!

514
00:43:07,435 --> 00:43:08,811
Maybe you missed orientation,

515
00:43:08,978 --> 00:43:12,481
but for future reference,
personal space is very important to me.

516
00:43:13,775 --> 00:43:15,609
You don't know who I am, do you?

517
00:43:15,777 --> 00:43:17,277
No.

518
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:19,446
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.

519
00:43:19,614 --> 00:43:21,782
Gather the others
and meet me in the war room.

520
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,451
Gretched, make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight.

521
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:26,578
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

522
00:43:26,746 --> 00:43:31,291
OK, I know you don't
remember me, but...

523
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:33,544
...we're married. Hear me out.

524
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:36,463
And at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet,

525
00:43:36,631 --> 00:43:38,048
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks,

526
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:40,259
and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar. "

527
00:43:40,427 --> 00:43:42,845
Then I punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing I knew,

528
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:45,347
my donkey fell in your waffle hole.

529
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,394
Right? Who's with me?

530
00:43:52,147 --> 00:43:54,773
I guess I must have kicked him
harder than I thought.

531
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:57,151
Fiona, I need to...

532
00:43:58,653 --> 00:44:01,155
Witches! All right, everyone,
you know the drill!

533
00:44:01,322 --> 00:44:03,157
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!

534
00:44:03,324 --> 00:44:05,409
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.

535
00:44:34,314 --> 00:44:37,107
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.

536
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:40,861
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.

537
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:45,616
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.

538
00:44:46,034 --> 00:44:49,077
Well, I see who wears the chain mail
in your family!

539
00:44:52,248 --> 00:44:57,252
Some people like to look
at the goblet as... as half empty.

540
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,423
Me, I like to look at it as half full.

541
00:45:02,258 --> 00:45:05,385
We've gone from the bottom
to the top, ladies.

542
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:08,680
But we're not just an empire.

543
00:45:09,224 --> 00:45:10,474
We're a family.

544
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:15,229
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?

545
00:45:15,396 --> 00:45:16,396
Good.

546
00:45:16,564 --> 00:45:19,775
Yeah, you know, we have
put away a lot of ogres.

547
00:45:19,943 --> 00:45:24,112
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.

548
00:45:24,614 --> 00:45:26,698
It doesn't matter to me.

549
00:45:26,866 --> 00:45:29,618
It's not like it's the end of the world.

550
00:45:30,787 --> 00:45:33,705
Except... funny thing.

551
00:45:33,873 --> 00:45:37,376
Now that I think about it,
the ogre who got away is Shrek!

552
00:45:37,544 --> 00:45:40,379
And if he shares a kiss
with Fiona by sunrise,

553
00:45:40,547 --> 00:45:43,715
it is the end of the world! Our world!

554
00:45:43,883 --> 00:45:45,759
My empire!

555
00:45:49,305 --> 00:45:51,765
But, as I was saying,

556
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:55,978
I like to look at the goblet
as half full.

557
00:45:57,438 --> 00:45:59,439
Yelling makes me so parched.

558
00:45:59,607 --> 00:46:03,443
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?

559
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:06,488
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...

560
00:46:06,656 --> 00:46:09,825
...of agua purificada?

561
00:46:09,993 --> 00:46:12,327
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?

562
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:15,330
Well, then does anyone care to tell me

563
00:46:15,498 --> 00:46:18,125
what it's going to take
to get this ogre? You.

564
00:46:18,293 --> 00:46:19,418
Faster brooms?

565
00:46:19,586 --> 00:46:21,169
- No!
- Pointier hats?

566
00:46:21,337 --> 00:46:22,963
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire

567
00:46:23,131 --> 00:46:24,840
a professional bounty hunter?

568
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:28,844
What a world! What a world!

569
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:33,390
You know, actually
not a bad idea. Baba!

570
00:46:34,017 --> 00:46:35,642
I need a bounty hunter.

571
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:38,979
And if music doth
soothe the savage beast...

572
00:46:39,147 --> 00:46:42,357
...then I think I might know
just the person!

573
00:46:44,694 --> 00:46:48,947
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.

574
00:46:49,115 --> 00:46:52,284
Stiltskin is leading
tonight's ogre hunt himself.

575
00:46:52,452 --> 00:46:54,161
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?

576
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:56,163
I bet that's because of us.

577
00:46:56,331 --> 00:46:58,081
If that cupcake-eating clown

578
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:01,376
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest...

579
00:47:02,045 --> 00:47:03,337
...he'll be vulnerable.

580
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:06,673
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route,

581
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:08,967
they'll reach the river by midnight.

582
00:47:09,135 --> 00:47:12,638
We'll be concealed along this road,
waiting for his caravan.

583
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:16,141
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.

584
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:18,185
And then we attack!

585
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:27,194
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?

586
00:47:27,362 --> 00:47:28,654
That's my chimichanga stand.

587
00:47:29,739 --> 00:47:31,907
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.

588
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:35,786
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be
really hungry after this ambush, OK?

589
00:47:36,704 --> 00:47:38,497
Go and finish your little speech.

590
00:47:39,248 --> 00:47:42,709
All right, as I was saying,
when the smoke clears,

591
00:47:42,877 --> 00:47:46,588
Rumpelstiltskin is gone
and the chimichangas have been eaten.

592
00:47:46,756 --> 00:47:49,383
Far Far Away will finally be free.

593
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,301
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.

594
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,721
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.

595
00:47:57,058 --> 00:47:59,267
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.

596
00:47:59,435 --> 00:48:02,020
How am I ever gonna
get her to kiss me before sunrise?

597
00:48:02,188 --> 00:48:03,730
Actually, I was talking
about the revolution.

598
00:48:03,898 --> 00:48:05,399
Revolution?

599
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:07,484
Why don't you just
tell her what you told me?

600
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:10,278
About how you're her true love and
you came from an alternate universe.

601
00:48:10,446 --> 00:48:12,239
Well, while I'm at it,
why don't I tell her

602
00:48:12,407 --> 00:48:14,408
that you're married
to a fire-breathing dragon

603
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:17,619
and you have little, mutant
donkey-dragon babies.

604
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:19,287
I do?!

605
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,374
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

606
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:23,750
I'm a daddy?

607
00:48:23,918 --> 00:48:27,295
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...

608
00:48:29,298 --> 00:48:31,091
...then I can do it again.

609
00:48:31,968 --> 00:48:34,177
Shrek, do my babies
have hooves or talons?

610
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:35,929
Donkey...!

611
00:48:36,097 --> 00:48:37,514
Hello?

612
00:48:38,975 --> 00:48:40,142
Fiona?

613
00:48:46,149 --> 00:48:49,234
You should not be here, senor.

614
00:48:49,402 --> 00:48:50,777
Puss?

615
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:57,993
You've gotta be kidding me.

616
00:49:11,841 --> 00:49:14,301
Feed me, if you dare.

617
00:49:14,469 --> 00:49:17,804
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...

618
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:22,184
- ... fancy.
- Do I know you?

619
00:49:22,351 --> 00:49:24,936
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?

620
00:49:25,104 --> 00:49:26,855
Your wee little boots?

621
00:49:27,023 --> 00:49:29,483
Boots? For a cat? Ha!

622
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,736
But you're Puss in Boots.

623
00:49:33,362 --> 00:49:34,946
Maybe once.

624
00:49:35,114 --> 00:49:36,656
But that is a name I have outgrown.

625
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:38,492
That's not the only thing
you've outgrown.

626
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:42,746
Hey! I may have let myself go
a little since retirement,

627
00:49:42,914 --> 00:49:45,499
but hanging up my sword
was the best decision of my life.

628
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:48,710
I have all the cream I can drink
and all the mice I can chase.

629
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:51,713
I'll get him later.

630
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:54,299
Puss, what have I done to you?

631
00:49:54,467 --> 00:49:55,926
You've gone soft.

632
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,889
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.

633
00:50:02,058 --> 00:50:03,683
Look, it's not too late to fix it.

634
00:50:03,851 --> 00:50:06,103
All you have to do is help me
get a kiss from Fiona.

635
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:09,397
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?

636
00:50:09,565 --> 00:50:12,526
Well, I know how stressful
mounting a rebellion can be...

637
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:14,694
...rallying the troops,
planning attacks,

638
00:50:14,862 --> 00:50:18,657
so I brought you a little something
to ease the tension.

639
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,283
A gift basket?

640
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:23,078
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.

641
00:50:23,246 --> 00:50:25,622
Heart-shaped box of slugs.

642
00:50:26,249 --> 00:50:28,708
Skunk-scented candle.

643
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:33,255
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!

644
00:50:33,422 --> 00:50:35,465
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage. "

645
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:37,968
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...

646
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:41,680
"Good for one free kiss. "
Let's cash it now.

647
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:43,849
Look, I don't know
what this is all about,

648
00:50:44,016 --> 00:50:45,559
but I'm trying to run a revolution.

649
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:47,936
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,

650
00:50:48,104 --> 00:50:50,230
I suggest you take your gift basket,

651
00:50:50,398 --> 00:50:54,109
get out of my tent
and go make yourself useful!

652
00:50:54,777 --> 00:50:59,072
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.

653
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,284
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?

654
00:51:03,911 --> 00:51:04,953
An apologetic hug?

655
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:07,455
And a quick kiss goodbye.

656
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:09,958
Hey!

657
00:51:10,585 --> 00:51:12,752
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?

658
00:51:14,463 --> 00:51:17,841
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do
they make people feel uncomfortable?

659
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:21,136
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?

660
00:51:21,304 --> 00:51:25,515
Have the years of prim
and pampery made me soft?

661
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:28,602
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?

662
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:30,353
I am.

663
00:51:38,154 --> 00:51:40,697
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.

664
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:43,033
Honk.

665
00:51:43,201 --> 00:51:44,784
All right, Piggies, be gone!

666
00:51:44,952 --> 00:51:47,162
Don't forget to take
her little potty box with you.

667
00:51:48,122 --> 00:51:50,081
This little piggy wants to go home!

668
00:51:50,249 --> 00:51:53,543
- Mr Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.

669
00:52:07,308 --> 00:52:10,477
Pied Piper. How was your commute?

670
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:13,647
Good.

671
00:52:13,814 --> 00:52:15,565
You call this guy a bounty hunter?

672
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:18,610
What's he gonna do,
flute those ogres a lullaby?

673
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:32,207
OK, got it!

674
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,543
Make it stop!

675
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,216
All right, that's enough.

676
00:52:44,553 --> 00:52:48,223
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.

677
00:52:50,393 --> 00:52:53,144
Griselda, seriously,
it's time to pay the piper.

678
00:52:53,312 --> 00:52:56,356
Now go get my chequebook!
Go! Move! Get out!

679
00:52:56,524 --> 00:52:58,525
Things are getting
real sloppy around here!

680
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,680
Here, now make sure they eat up!

681
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:07,242
You can't end tyranny on
an empty stomach! Go on! Go!

682
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:08,910
Din-din!

683
00:53:16,669 --> 00:53:19,546
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?

684
00:53:19,714 --> 00:53:22,007
All right, but this is the last time.

685
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:24,592
Here it comes. Look at him.

686
00:53:29,932 --> 00:53:31,766
I see you!

687
00:53:38,691 --> 00:53:40,567
That's quite a friend you've got there.

688
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,861
I can see why you haven't eaten him.

689
00:53:43,029 --> 00:53:45,655
Donkey! I hate to pull you away
from your adoring public,

690
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:48,116
but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.

691
00:53:48,284 --> 00:53:51,369
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?

692
00:53:54,165 --> 00:53:56,207
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.

693
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:59,294
Just another gift from some
clueless lover boy.

694
00:54:01,088 --> 00:54:02,756
That's a good one, Cookie!

695
00:54:03,758 --> 00:54:06,760
Anyone who knows Fiona knows
this stuff ain't gonna work on her.

696
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:08,428
Works on me.

697
00:54:08,596 --> 00:54:11,473
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.

698
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,018
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.

699
00:54:15,186 --> 00:54:18,188
- To the cause!
- To the cause!

700
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:21,524
All right!

701
00:54:44,006 --> 00:54:45,006
Hello!

702
00:54:49,011 --> 00:54:51,096
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?

703
00:54:51,263 --> 00:54:53,973
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.

704
00:54:54,141 --> 00:54:56,810
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes

705
00:54:56,977 --> 00:55:01,147
and do some scrunches
before an operational... op.

706
00:55:01,315 --> 00:55:02,357
This one taken?

707
00:55:02,525 --> 00:55:04,359
We use that to clean the toilets.

708
00:55:06,278 --> 00:55:09,406
And we use that one to clean
the thing we clean the toilets with.

709
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:10,865
I knew that.

710
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:13,076
There you go, chief.

711
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:32,387
Hey... Scott?

712
00:55:32,888 --> 00:55:34,722
My name is Shrek, actually.

713
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,725
You're going to get yourself killed
at the ambush tonight.

714
00:55:37,893 --> 00:55:41,521
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...

715
00:55:42,022 --> 00:55:43,273
Well, let's see about that.

716
00:55:43,691 --> 00:55:46,151
Hey! Hey... Hey!

717
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:47,360
What the...?

718
00:55:52,074 --> 00:55:53,408
Fiona?

719
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:27,275
I got it.

720
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:28,943
Give me your hand.

721
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,989
The dragon goes under the bridge,

722
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:35,408
through the loop and finally...

723
00:56:35,576 --> 00:56:37,160
Into the castle.

724
00:56:45,794 --> 00:56:47,128
Wow.

725
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:50,965
OK. Good.

726
00:56:51,592 --> 00:56:53,301
It seems like you can handle yourself.

727
00:56:53,469 --> 00:56:55,428
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!

728
00:56:55,596 --> 00:56:58,598
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!

729
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:13,112
All right, let's get those axes
sharpened and weapons packed!

730
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,864
Preparation is half the battle!

731
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:20,495
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!

732
00:57:20,996 --> 00:57:23,540
Ogre, ogre, un momento!

733
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:26,459
Just give me a minute.

734
00:57:26,627 --> 00:57:29,462
Look, Puss, I'm a little
pressed for time.

735
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,799
I am not believing
what I have just witnessed.

736
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:34,634
Back there, you and Fiona.

737
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:37,470
There was a spark...
a spark inside her heart

738
00:57:37,638 --> 00:57:39,347
I thought was long extinguished.

739
00:57:39,515 --> 00:57:43,935
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!

740
00:57:44,103 --> 00:57:47,438
I am her true love. I ended her curse.

741
00:57:48,023 --> 00:57:49,857
You know of her curse?

742
00:57:50,025 --> 00:57:53,319
By day, one way, by night another.

743
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:56,239
This shall be the norm.

744
00:57:56,407 --> 00:57:59,909
Until you find true love's first kiss...

745
00:58:01,203 --> 00:58:05,081
...and then take love's true form.

746
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:07,834
You even know the little rhyme!

747
00:58:08,002 --> 00:58:10,503
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!

748
00:58:10,671 --> 00:58:12,839
- How?
- Convince her!

749
00:58:13,007 --> 00:58:14,340
Go to her when she is alone

750
00:58:14,508 --> 00:58:18,177
and tell her something
that only her true love would know.

751
00:58:18,345 --> 00:58:19,887
Know about what?!

752
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:25,018
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?

753
00:58:41,744 --> 00:58:43,578
Excuse me. Coming through!

754
00:58:43,746 --> 00:58:46,456
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.

755
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:49,500
Look, Donkey,
the chimichanga cart! Quick!

756
00:58:49,668 --> 00:58:52,545
Ándale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vámonos!

757
00:58:52,713 --> 00:58:54,839
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!

758
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:57,383
And you are ri-donkey-lous!

759
00:59:03,265 --> 00:59:06,059
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.

760
00:59:11,106 --> 00:59:12,982
Secure your positions!

761
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,876
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!

762
00:59:32,044 --> 00:59:33,086
Get back in position!

763
00:59:33,253 --> 00:59:36,339
You need to know,
once and for all, who I really am.

764
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:37,965
You are going to ruin everything!

765
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:40,385
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...

766
00:59:40,552 --> 00:59:43,262
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.

767
00:59:44,848 --> 00:59:46,516
How do you know about my curse?!

768
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:51,104
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.

769
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:53,815
I can explain everything.

770
00:59:57,319 --> 01:00:00,113
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?

771
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,116
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.

772
01:00:28,684 --> 01:00:32,478
Listen, I don't know who you are
or how you know about my curse,

773
01:00:32,646 --> 01:00:34,522
but if any of these ogres
find out I'm...

774
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:37,942
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.

775
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:41,154
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.

776
01:00:41,321 --> 01:00:42,989
I know everything about you.

777
01:00:43,157 --> 01:00:46,159
I know you sing so beautifully
that birds explode.

778
01:00:46,326 --> 01:00:48,494
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,

779
01:00:48,662 --> 01:00:51,330
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?

780
01:00:51,498 --> 01:00:53,499
I know that when
you see a shooting star,

781
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:55,668
you cross your fingers on both hands,

782
01:00:55,836 --> 01:00:59,630
squinch up your nose
and you make a wish.

783
01:00:59,798 --> 01:01:02,675
I know that you don't like the covers
wrapped around your feet,

784
01:01:02,843 --> 01:01:04,510
and I know that you sleep by candlelight

785
01:01:04,678 --> 01:01:06,679
because every time
you close your eyes...

786
01:01:07,723 --> 01:01:10,725
...you're afraid you're gonna
wake up back in that tower.

787
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:14,562
But, most importantly, Fiona...

788
01:01:15,564 --> 01:01:19,150
...I know that the reason
you turn human every day...

789
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:23,529
...is because you've
never been kissed...

790
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:26,073
...well...

791
01:01:28,577 --> 01:01:29,744
...by me.

792
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:43,216
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.

793
01:01:45,219 --> 01:01:47,386
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?

794
01:01:47,554 --> 01:01:50,681
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!

795
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:53,601
No, I can't stop myself!

796
01:01:53,769 --> 01:01:56,604
Please! Make it stop!

797
01:01:56,772 --> 01:01:58,940
I can't control myself!

798
01:02:02,778 --> 01:02:05,905
Yeah! Cookie's bringing
the heat out of the kitchen!

799
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:10,618
Oh, no! It's the Piper!

800
01:02:12,788 --> 01:02:16,415
I can't believe I let this happen,
and it's all because of you!

801
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:21,003
- If you'd just let me kiss you!
- What? You're insane!

802
01:02:35,936 --> 01:02:40,022
We must do something before
they fandango themselves into oblivion!

803
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:43,609
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!

804
01:02:43,777 --> 01:02:46,487
When somebody tooties that flutey,
I got to shake my booty!

805
01:02:46,655 --> 01:02:48,281
Then it's up to me!

806
01:02:56,832 --> 01:03:00,668
Hurry! We must get them
away from the music!

807
01:03:03,005 --> 01:03:06,090
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!

808
01:03:31,783 --> 01:03:34,285
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?

809
01:03:34,453 --> 01:03:35,536
Say what?!

810
01:03:36,496 --> 01:03:37,830
No. Hell...

811
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:43,336
I don't care how big your eyes get,
player, it's not going down.

812
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:50,176
All right!

813
01:03:50,677 --> 01:03:51,677
Stop!

814
01:03:51,845 --> 01:03:54,347
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.

815
01:03:54,514 --> 01:03:57,350
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.

816
01:03:57,517 --> 01:03:58,809
Puss, say something.

817
01:03:58,977 --> 01:04:00,853
- Puss?
- Let me explain.

818
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:03,147
That's how you knew so much about me.

819
01:04:03,315 --> 01:04:06,400
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?

820
01:04:06,568 --> 01:04:08,194
It's the only way to save your friends.

821
01:04:08,362 --> 01:04:09,320
Get out of my way.

822
01:04:09,488 --> 01:04:12,698
You used to believe that a single kiss
could solve everything!

823
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:43,521
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

824
01:04:43,689 --> 01:04:46,315
True love's kiss
was supposed to fix everything!

825
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:48,567
Yeah, you know,
that's what they told me, too.

826
01:04:48,735 --> 01:04:51,070
True love didn't get me
out of that tower.

827
01:04:51,238 --> 01:04:53,948
I did. I saved myself.

828
01:04:55,117 --> 01:04:58,577
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.

829
01:04:58,745 --> 01:05:01,163
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!

830
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:02,707
How would you know?

831
01:05:02,874 --> 01:05:05,584
Did you grow up locked away
in a dragon's keep?

832
01:05:05,752 --> 01:05:08,587
Did you live all alone
in a miserable tower?

833
01:05:08,755 --> 01:05:11,090
Did you cry yourself
to sleep every night,

834
01:05:11,258 --> 01:05:13,843
waiting for a true love
that never came?!

835
01:05:15,137 --> 01:05:18,723
But... But I'm your true love.

836
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:22,309
Then where were you
when I needed you?

837
01:05:34,156 --> 01:05:36,657
Maybe you kissed her wrong?

838
01:05:37,284 --> 01:05:38,325
No.

839
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:40,661
The kiss didn't work...

840
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:43,956
...because Fiona doesn't love me.

841
01:05:50,505 --> 01:05:52,214
Don't despair, fellow ogres!

842
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:56,635
They can put us in cages,
but they can't cage our honour!

843
01:05:58,013 --> 01:06:00,931
Shrek and Fiona are together?!

844
01:06:03,018 --> 01:06:06,270
Yeah, I've heard enough of
your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!

845
01:06:06,438 --> 01:06:08,105
Wolfie! My speech wig.

846
01:06:08,273 --> 01:06:12,526
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.

847
01:06:14,988 --> 01:06:15,946
Tight.

848
01:06:16,114 --> 01:06:17,615
Attention, citizens.

849
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:22,703
Please stay tuned for a message
from our tyrannical dictator!

850
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:27,500
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...

851
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:29,752
...shepherd of your dreams.

852
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:34,548
Recently, a certain somebody

853
01:06:34,716 --> 01:06:38,052
has jeopardized our joyous lives.

854
01:06:39,012 --> 01:06:43,974
And that somebody
is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!

855
01:06:44,142 --> 01:06:46,435
That is why I come to you,
dear citizens.

856
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:49,105
For whomever brings me this ogre,

857
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:53,567
shall receive the deal of a lifetime.

858
01:06:53,944 --> 01:06:55,361
Just think of it! Total and

859
01:06:55,529 --> 01:06:57,238
- complete happiness.
- Ya!

860
01:06:57,405 --> 01:07:00,866
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
All your greatest wishes.

861
01:07:01,034 --> 01:07:03,035
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.

862
01:07:03,203 --> 01:07:07,832
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!

863
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:11,210
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.

864
01:07:11,378 --> 01:07:17,216
So light your torches, sharpen
your pitchforks and get your mob on!

865
01:07:17,717 --> 01:07:20,761
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

866
01:07:25,016 --> 01:07:27,059
Go back where you came from!

867
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:31,856
It seems that we are safe.

868
01:07:32,023 --> 01:07:34,817
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky
and torchy out there. Let's go.

869
01:07:34,985 --> 01:07:39,071
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.

870
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:42,241
Look, Shrek, I know things
might seem a little bleak right now,

871
01:07:42,409 --> 01:07:44,869
but things always work themselves
out in the end, you'll see.

872
01:07:45,036 --> 01:07:47,413
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?

873
01:07:47,581 --> 01:07:49,248
There is no tomorrow.

874
01:07:49,416 --> 01:07:53,377
There's no day after that, and there's
no day after that day after that!

875
01:07:53,545 --> 01:07:57,047
My life was perfect
and I'm never going to get it back!

876
01:07:57,215 --> 01:08:00,801
If your life was so perfect, why'd you
sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?

877
01:08:00,969 --> 01:08:04,346
Because I didn't know
what I had until it was gone! All right?

878
01:08:09,144 --> 01:08:10,978
I didn't know what I had.

879
01:08:13,565 --> 01:08:17,067
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!

880
01:08:17,652 --> 01:08:21,238
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!

881
01:08:21,406 --> 01:08:22,406
Gingy?

882
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,618
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?

883
01:08:25,785 --> 01:08:27,077
Collecting my bounty!

884
01:08:27,245 --> 01:08:29,246
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?

885
01:08:29,998 --> 01:08:32,458
Rumpelstiltskin promised
the deal of a lifetime

886
01:08:32,626 --> 01:08:35,628
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?

887
01:08:35,795 --> 01:08:38,839
Where all your wishes come true.

888
01:08:40,508 --> 01:08:41,842
Wait a minute.

889
01:08:42,636 --> 01:08:45,346
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?

890
01:08:45,513 --> 01:08:49,808
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.

891
01:08:49,976 --> 01:08:52,311
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...

892
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:58,692
Were you going to eat that?

893
01:09:00,695 --> 01:09:03,781
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
Also not Shrek.

894
01:09:03,949 --> 01:09:07,284
That's not even an ogre,
it is a troll! Nice try.

895
01:09:07,452 --> 01:09:08,452
- And that...
- Roar.

896
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:09,620
...is just sad.

897
01:09:10,497 --> 01:09:12,373
And what is that supposed to be?

898
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,124
I'm just a frightened old man.

899
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:17,211
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!

900
01:09:17,379 --> 01:09:19,004
That is your father painted green.

901
01:09:19,172 --> 01:09:21,215
No, it's Shrek! Honest!

902
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:23,801
Take them away!

903
01:09:23,969 --> 01:09:26,845
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?

904
01:09:27,013 --> 01:09:29,723
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!

905
01:09:30,225 --> 01:09:31,558
Stiltskin!

906
01:09:33,144 --> 01:09:34,853
I hear you're looking for me.

907
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:37,648
All right! Finally!

908
01:09:37,816 --> 01:09:41,277
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?

909
01:09:41,444 --> 01:09:43,279
- I do.
- What? But...

910
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:47,366
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.

911
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:54,123
That means you have
to give me anything I want.

912
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:56,875
No! Only true love's kiss
can break your contract!

913
01:09:57,043 --> 01:09:58,919
So if you thought you were just gonna...

914
01:09:59,963 --> 01:10:04,216
- ... in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.

915
01:10:04,759 --> 01:10:07,177
Then what do you want?

916
01:10:17,939 --> 01:10:20,441
The ogres. They are all free.

917
01:10:20,608 --> 01:10:22,109
But where is Shrek?

918
01:10:27,282 --> 01:10:29,616
This is not good.

919
01:10:30,744 --> 01:10:34,246
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.

920
01:10:34,414 --> 01:10:40,252
The noble Shrek turns himself in
to save a bunch of filthy ogres.

921
01:10:40,795 --> 01:10:43,464
All that matters is that they're free...

922
01:10:43,965 --> 01:10:45,966
...and Fiona is safe.

923
01:10:47,469 --> 01:10:50,429
I bet Fiona would be
really touched to hear that.

924
01:10:51,097 --> 01:10:52,389
But, hey...

925
01:10:52,557 --> 01:10:55,476
...I guess you can tell her yourself.

926
01:10:56,311 --> 01:10:57,770
Fiona!

927
01:11:06,154 --> 01:11:10,449
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!

928
01:11:10,617 --> 01:11:11,867
Oh, yeah.

929
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:16,663
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?

930
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:25,464
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.

931
01:11:27,342 --> 01:11:29,551
Nobody's smart but me!

932
01:11:37,685 --> 01:11:40,187
That was a really brave thing
you did, Shrek.

933
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:41,980
Thank you.

934
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:45,025
No, you were right.

935
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,986
I wasn't there for you.

936
01:11:48,154 --> 01:11:50,489
And not just at
the Dragon's Keep, but...

937
01:11:51,825 --> 01:11:53,575
...every day since.

938
01:11:54,536 --> 01:11:55,702
Well...

939
01:11:56,704 --> 01:11:58,330
...you're here now.

940
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:02,835
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!

941
01:12:03,002 --> 01:12:04,378
Don't be a fool, mule!

942
01:12:04,546 --> 01:12:07,047
She's right. Rumpel's palace
is locked up tighter

943
01:12:07,215 --> 01:12:10,509
- than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded

944
01:12:10,677 --> 01:12:13,679
by a whole bunch of
mean, ugly, nasty witches.

945
01:12:13,847 --> 01:12:16,723
Hey! We can hear you!

946
01:12:17,559 --> 01:12:19,059
Sorry!

947
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,354
We must get into the palace.

948
01:12:22,522 --> 01:12:24,648
Man, Shrek and me
just busted out of that place!

949
01:12:24,816 --> 01:12:26,358
But how?

950
01:12:27,569 --> 01:12:30,529
The same way we're gonna bust in.

951
01:12:34,993 --> 01:12:39,121
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?

952
01:12:39,289 --> 01:12:40,873
I guess it'll have to do.

953
01:12:46,337 --> 01:12:51,049
Witches, finally, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

954
01:12:51,217 --> 01:12:54,011
The main event of the evening!

955
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:57,347
I present Shrek and Fiona!

956
01:13:02,437 --> 01:13:06,482
And now, to put the past
behind us once and for all,

957
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:10,402
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!

958
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:14,156
Fiona's old flame,
the keeper of the keep...

959
01:13:14,324 --> 01:13:15,908
...Dragon!

960
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:41,183
- Donkey?
- And Puss!

961
01:13:44,979 --> 01:13:46,104
In Boots!

962
01:14:16,219 --> 01:14:18,262
Get them, get them, witches!

963
01:14:20,098 --> 01:14:21,640
Incoming!

964
01:14:25,853 --> 01:14:28,230
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?

965
01:14:28,398 --> 01:14:29,773
Your wife!

966
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:54,965
Uh-oh.

967
01:15:00,471 --> 01:15:03,765
I'll call you! We're in love!

968
01:15:15,528 --> 01:15:16,987
Fiona, hold on!

969
01:15:18,698 --> 01:15:20,324
Hey, you!

970
01:15:49,854 --> 01:15:52,939
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!

971
01:15:59,864 --> 01:16:01,073
Jump!

972
01:16:04,535 --> 01:16:05,744
Now!

973
01:16:19,801 --> 01:16:22,427
The dragon goes under the bridge!

974
01:16:23,554 --> 01:16:25,055
Through the loop!

975
01:16:25,223 --> 01:16:26,306
And finally...

976
01:16:26,474 --> 01:16:28,058
Into the castle!

977
01:16:34,732 --> 01:16:36,108
Run!

978
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,573
Foo!

979
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:46,743
So long!

980
01:16:49,622 --> 01:16:50,747
Come on, Fifi, go!

981
01:16:50,915 --> 01:16:52,791
Go! Witches, close up the floor!

982
01:16:53,918 --> 01:16:56,545
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!

983
01:16:56,713 --> 01:17:00,090
Come on, go! Fly away! Up, up! Go!

984
01:17:00,925 --> 01:17:02,259
Fifi, no!

985
01:17:07,014 --> 01:17:08,932
Victory is ours!

986
01:17:17,316 --> 01:17:20,318
Looks like we're having
curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

987
01:17:20,486 --> 01:17:23,071
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

988
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,198
You have no idea.

989
01:17:33,124 --> 01:17:34,458
Shrek?

990
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:40,130
His day is up. His day is...!

991
01:17:40,715 --> 01:17:41,882
Shrek?

992
01:17:42,967 --> 01:17:44,634
It's all right.

993
01:17:48,181 --> 01:17:50,474
There has to be something I can do.

994
01:17:51,309 --> 01:17:54,936
You've already done
everything for me, Fiona.

995
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:57,689
You gave me a home and a family.

996
01:17:57,857 --> 01:17:59,608
You have kids?

997
01:17:59,776 --> 01:18:01,777
We have kids.

998
01:18:01,944 --> 01:18:05,822
Fergus, Farkle
and a little girl named...

999
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:07,324
- ... Felicia.
- Felicia.

1000
01:18:08,201 --> 01:18:10,994
I always wanted to have
a daughter named Felicia.

1001
01:18:11,537 --> 01:18:13,205
And someday...

1002
01:18:14,874 --> 01:18:16,208
...you will.

1003
01:18:26,886 --> 01:18:29,554
You know what the
best part of today was?

1004
01:18:32,183 --> 01:18:36,353
I got the chance to fall in love
with you all over again.

1005
01:19:10,263 --> 01:19:13,098
Fiona, the sunrise!

1006
01:19:13,266 --> 01:19:15,559
You're still... an ogre!

1007
01:19:18,062 --> 01:19:21,022
- True love's form.
- Impossible!

1008
01:19:21,774 --> 01:19:23,441
The kiss worked.

1009
01:19:30,116 --> 01:19:31,449
What?!

1010
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:42,294
Fifi!

1011
01:19:44,088 --> 01:19:45,422
Puss!

1012
01:19:47,758 --> 01:19:49,509
No, no, no!

1013
01:19:49,677 --> 01:19:52,762
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!

1014
01:20:06,903 --> 01:20:08,361
I love you, Daddy!

1015
01:20:08,529 --> 01:20:11,781
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

1016
01:20:16,203 --> 01:20:19,414
Everybody, I have found another cake!

1017
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:22,459
Shrek? Are you OK?

1018
01:20:28,966 --> 01:20:33,136
Fiona. I've never been better.

1019
01:20:35,306 --> 01:20:36,973
Roar!

1020
01:20:41,812 --> 01:20:44,147
Happy Birthday, Farkle.

1021
01:20:44,315 --> 01:20:46,608
Fergus, my little man!

1022
01:20:46,776 --> 01:20:49,069
And Felicia, sweetheart.

1023
01:20:49,236 --> 01:20:51,488
I believe this is yours.

1024
01:20:52,865 --> 01:20:54,532
Thank you, Daddy.

1025
01:20:56,035 --> 01:20:58,536
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about
giving my babies an encore!

1026
01:20:58,704 --> 01:21:00,830
Please, señor, let us have it!

1027
01:21:12,134 --> 01:21:15,595
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!

1028
01:21:16,847 --> 01:21:19,015
You know, I always thought

1029
01:21:19,183 --> 01:21:21,559
that I rescued you
from the Dragon's Keep.

1030
01:21:21,727 --> 01:21:23,103
You did.

1031
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:26,856
No. It was you that rescued me.

1032
01:22:57,948 --> 01:22:59,282
Yummy!
