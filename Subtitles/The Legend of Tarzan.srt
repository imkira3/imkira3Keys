2
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,712
<i>Monsieur</i> Rom...

3
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,519
Opar.

4
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,710
We found it.

5
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,434
Captain Moulle?

6
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,077
Form your lines.

7
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,597
Maxims ready, sir!

8
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,998
<i>Steady.</i>

9
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,432
<i>Wait.</i>

10
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,355
Fire!

11
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,314
<i>Fall in!</i>

12
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,152
Stand your ground!

13
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,148
Chief Mbonga, I presume?

14
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,037
How do you know my name?

15
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,632
You're the man I came to see.

16
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,910
These are what you came for.

17
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,877
What would you do for them?

18
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,517
Whatever is necessary.

19
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,590
There is one thing I desire
above all else.

20
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,198
Bring it to me.

21
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,069
Bring <i>him</i> to me.

22
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,955
And you shall have your diamonds.

23
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,157
All I need is a name.

24
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,035
His Serene Highness,
King Leopold of Belgium,

25
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,397
has extended an invitation
to Lord Greystoke

26
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,473
<i>to take a royal tour
of the Congo Free State</i>

27
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,074
<i>to visit the schools
and churches he's built</i>

28
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,155
to acknowledge the success
of his anti-slavery initiatives

29
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,590
and to open trade discussions.

30
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,156
Lord Greystoke,
let me explain the Africa situation.

31
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Mmm.

32
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,433
King Leopold controls the Congo.

33
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,957
<i>He's defaulting on his loans,</i>

34
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,237
<i>and needs a business partner
to fill the gap.</i>

35
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,119
<i>Your invitation is a perfect opportunity</i>

36
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,113
<i>for Her Majesty's government
to get involved.</i>

37
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,516
Consider the jobs we would create
for the poor natives of the Congo.

38
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,828
And I thought the Civil War was long.

39
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,269
Dr. Williams, you are a guest here.

40
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,874
<i>Prime Minister,
if you're not going to say it,</i>

41
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,834
allow me.

42
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,793
You are Tarzan.

43
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,151
<i>Lord of the Apes, King of the Jungle.</i>

44
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,117
<i>"Me Tarzan, you Jane!"</i>

45
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,316
Tarzan! Tarzan.

46
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,878
King Leopold's inviting you
because you're a celebrity.

47
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,759
<i>He wants to show you
the schools and churches he built.</i>

48
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,275
<i>You "ooh" and "ah"
in front of the newspapers,</i>

49
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,710
and he's validated
by Africa's favorite son.

50
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,594
England pays his debts. We make money.

51
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,274
- Ham sandwich. Easy.
- Hmm.

52
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,279
So, Your Majesties,

53
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,352
can we get this show on the road?

54
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
No.

55
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,838
- No?
- For Heaven's sake, why not?

56
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,434
<i>Well, I've already seen Africa.</i>

57
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,389
And it's hot.

58
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,554
Excuse me? Did you say "hot"?

59
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,032
Please send my apologies
to His Serene Highness.

60
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,560
And my name isn't Tarzan.

61
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,676
It's John Clayton III.

62
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,832
Son of John and Lady Alice Clayton.

63
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,079
Fifth Earl of Greystoke,
member of the House of Lords.

64
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,752
<i>Mr. Clayton.</i>

65
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,388
Lord Clayton. My apologies.

66
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,438
George Washington Williams.
Diplomatic envoy for the United States.

67
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,915
- I was sent by President Harrison.
- To do what?

68
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,593
Join up with the Queen's emissary.

69
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,070
America was the first country to recognize
King Leopold's claim on the Congo.

70
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,029
You don't want to lose
your place at the trough.

71
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,428
Look...

72
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,438
I need your invitation to get in.

73
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,955
I'm afraid my intentions aren't exactly

74
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,310
what I expressed
to your government or mine.

75
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,433
And what exactly
do you want, Dr. Williams?

76
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,552
Leopold spent the last seven years
getting control of the Congo.

77
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,188
He used up his entire fortune
building that railroad of his,

78
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,193
then shut off access
to 99% of the country.

79
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Why?

80
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
<i>Because he wants to be
the first monarch in history</i>

81
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,114
<i>who doesn't want people
to see his good deeds?</i>

82
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,952
<i>I don't buy it.</i>

83
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,238
T ell me this, Lord Clayton.

84
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,389
How does a bankrupt king
keep the whole of the Congo working?

85
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,109
Slavery?

86
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,797
I hope I'm wrong, but I need to know.

87
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,918
And for the sake
of your friends back home,

88
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,155
you do, too.

89
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,359
Accept Leopold's invitation
and take me with you.

90
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,988
You know Africa off the beaten path.

91
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,594
<i>The languages, the people, the customs.</i>

92
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,673
If we find anything amiss,

93
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,709
then I need someone to tell the world
that they'll believe.

94
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,997
I'll make all the arrangements.

95
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,151
I'll see you in Liverpool.

96
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,153
My family.

97
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,439
<i>I have done all I can to protect them.</i>

98
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,437
<i>We have been surrounded by predators
since the shipwreck.</i>

99
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,757
<i>The jungle consumes everything.</i>

100
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,233
<i>It preys on the old, the sick,
the wounded, the weak.</i>

101
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,391
<i>But never the strong.</i>

102
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,548
<i>Today, I buried my Alice.</i>

103
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,751
<i>My dear Alice.</i>

104
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,559
<i>Now I fear for my child.</i>

105
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,759
<i>God help us.</i>

106
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,519
<i>God help him.</i>

107
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,719
<i>The most dangerous beast
in Africa is so powerful,</i>

108
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,316
it can snap a crocodile's back
with a single bite.

109
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,673
Anyone?

110
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,190
Is it a hippopotamus?

111
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,909
Yes! Precisely. Well done, Mary.

112
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
<i>Now,</i>

113
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,514
can anyone tell me
what my favorite bird sounds like?

114
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,278
Anyone?

115
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,760
How do you travel through the jungle?

116
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,438
<i>Why'd you leave the jungle?</i>

117
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
Look at his hands!

118
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,551
Whoa!

119
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,716
I grew up running on all fours.

120
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,869
It changed the bone structure.

121
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,470
Do you swing on things inside?

122
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,756
Like, when you go upstairs?

123
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,872
Oh, I never take the stairs.

124
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,399
I usually take the curtains.

125
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,629
Amazing!

126
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,318
Is it true your mum was a monkey?

127
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,031
Well, of course not.

128
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,395
My mum was Alice Clayton.

129
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,911
I can't wait to see Wasimbu again.

130
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,656
- How many children would he have now?
- Jane.

131
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,716
We know about Keko. She's what, four?

132
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,632
- Everyone would have children.
<i>- Jane.</i>

133
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,677
I mean, eight years
just feels like a lifetime!

134
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,114
This isn't a holiday.

135
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,430
How many corsets does a diplomat bring?

136
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,397
<i>I can't take you.</i>

137
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,511
- I say zero.
- Four.

138
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,636
I suppose a British lady should faint
at least twice to justify the silly title.

139
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
It isn't safe there.

140
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,638
Of course it's not safe there, John!

141
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,435
You take a nap in the wrong place,
you've got a 50-50 chance of being eaten.

142
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,750
Ladies. Albert.

143
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,798
<i>You can't possibly still think
there is a danger, John.</i>

144
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,310
And you haven't spoken his name in years.

145
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,479
Talk to me.

146
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,470
Mbonga is not my concern.

147
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,314
You are.

148
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,911
We lost a baby.

149
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,152
The last thing you need is more stress.

150
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,239
Yes, well...

151
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,038
Thank you for the reminder.

152
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,193
Well, in case you forgot,
we both grew up there.

153
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,949
So, perhaps I will fulfill your duties
for the Queen,

154
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,314
and you can stay here

155
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,988
hybridizing coconuts
and playing ping-pong.

156
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,034
I want to go home.

157
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,349
<i>This is our home.</i>

158
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,350
Trying to keep me here won't work!

159
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,319
<i>John, my son,</i>

160
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,392
<i>you are the heir to Greystoke, our future.</i>

161
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,753
<i>England is your home,
not this wretched place.</i>

162
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
<i>If I don't survive,</i>

163
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,309
<i>I pray that someone will save you.</i>

164
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,512
Promise me
you'll stay with the Kuba the whole time.

165
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,713
Not a chance, ma'am.

166
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,158
A kick from one of these Walker Colts
is pretty nasty.

167
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,480
As a matter of fact,
that's why they went out of style.

168
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,677
Pretty little ladies like you
kept knocking themselves in the face.

169
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,838
I'll bet I could
hit that log over there, first try.

170
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,035
Oh!

171
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,708
<i>Jane?</i>

172
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,154
He's known them since they were cubs.

173
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,957
Force Publique, move aside.

174
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,634
Force Publique, move aside!

175
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,838
I want port of entry,

176
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,753
I want port of disembarkation
for every passenger.

177
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,478
Yes, sir. These are the last.

178
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,949
- Sir.
- Thank you. Thank you.

179
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
Excuse me, sir.

180
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,629
The ledger.

181
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,279
Yes, thank you.

182
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,998
<i>Gramophone, Mr. Rom's stateroom.</i>

183
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,549
<i>Mr. Frum.</i>

184
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,632
Those crates go in the hold.

185
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,759
Champagne? And music?
Your entire operation just fell apart.

186
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,995
Have faith, Mr. Frum.

187
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,037
Faith is for missionaries.

188
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,428
He gave you the slip.

189
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,400
Make sure the rest goes down below.

190
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,872
Our invitation
has been snubbed, Mr. Frum.

191
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,792
They jumped ship further up the coast,

192
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,110
and they are
on their own little tour home.

193
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,914
So, from Boma up to here
will take me three days.

194
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,038
I shall deliver Tarzan and return.

195
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,838
A week's delay.

196
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,514
You're in no position
to ask for anything, Mr. Rom.

197
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,433
Your king's payment was due
three months ago.

198
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,669
Yes.

199
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,710
I manipulated my firm
to keep this deal alive.

200
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,296
You agreed
because you'll get stinking rich,

201
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,389
so don't get trutty.

202
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,834
Now, you must buy us more time.

203
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,116
I already bought all the time...

204
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,429
<i>Look, it's really very easy.</i>

205
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,153
You sail out to the arriving fleet

206
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,960
and tell them payment
must be made in Boma

207
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,792
for security reasons.

208
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,438
Opar had better not be a myth.

209
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,877
<i>Bring me the rest,
and you'll have your mercenaries.</i>

210
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,712
But if you fail to make good this time,

211
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,559
my firm will go to the Belgian parliament
for compensation.

212
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,239
Your king will lose this land,

213
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,391
<i>and who do you think he will blame?</i>

214
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,073
Leon Rom?

215
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,353
Tarzan, you look funny.

216
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,034
<i>Wukonseeni!</i>

217
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,270
<i>- Sangonini!</i>
- Janey!

218
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,831
<i>- Sangonini.
- Ton moh nah nah ha lah.</i>

219
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,520
<i>Keikoo.</i>

220
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
Wasimbu?

221
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,392
Oh, my God!

222
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,833
Janey Porter. Welcome home.

223
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,038
As is custom,

224
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,555
no one has entered until you returned.

225
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,636
This is where Jane grew up.

226
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,198
Her father taught English in the village.

227
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,320
Well, I'm not going to drink
some foaming cup of

228
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,516
you-know-what-it-is-and-won't-tell-me.

229
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,596
<i>That's funny
to everybody, huh? Mmm-hmm.</i>

230
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Whoo!

231
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,556
They're singing the legend of Tarzan.

232
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,358
For many moons,
he was thought to be an evil spirit.

233
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,192
<i>A ghost in the trees.</i>

234
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,353
<i>They speak of his power
over the animals of the jungle.</i>

235
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,635
<i>Because his spirit came from them.</i>

236
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,069
<i>He understood them</i>

237
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,359
<i>and learned to conquer them.</i>

238
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,394
<i>His ape mother, Kala,
loved him as her own,</i>

239
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,235
<i>and his ape brother, Akut,
treated him with kindness and respect.</i>

240
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,120
He considered all men to be his enemies,

241
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,917
<i>since other tribes would hunt his troop
as a rite of passage.</i>

242
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,359
<i>Chief Muviro knew what he was.</i>

243
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
<i>He was good to him,</i>

244
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,949
since no man ever started with less.

245
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
John?

246
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,354
Blue-bottom rufous towhee.

247
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,711
Mating call.

248
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,030
Be still, my beating heart.

249
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,638
Mandrill.

250
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,110
Also a mating call.

251
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,473
Cheetah.

252
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,993
Mating call.

253
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,957
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

254
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,998
eight, seven,

255
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,391
six, five, four,

256
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,829
three,

257
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,635
two...

258
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,519
<i>I know you took my handkerchief.</i>

259
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,355
We're from America,
and my father is a professor.

260
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,353
So, I didn't grow up believing in spirits.

261
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040
<i>Hello.</i>

262
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,713
You're welcome to have it.

263
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,312
Will you speak to me?

264
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
<i>Um...</i>

265
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,515
You must know that this is very peculiar.

266
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,278
I'm not sure my father would
find this very appropriate.

267
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,832
But, um...

268
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,276
We must make an effort
to embrace customs...

269
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,154
Oh! I don't think so, wild man!

270
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,549
No, no, no. Wait!

271
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,110
I speak many languages.

272
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,315
Kneel!

273
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,038
Kuba chief never kneels.

274
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,674
<i>- Down! All of you!</i>
- Get down!

275
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,389
Take aim!

276
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,719
<i>Come on!</i>

277
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,879
<i>Hold him still!</i>

278
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,351
<i>Tighter! Tighter!</i>

279
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,152
You ain't so tough,
you grotty little monkey boy.

280
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,838
Some legend, Mr. Rom.

281
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,514
<i>Chief Mbonga will be disappointed.</i>

282
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,632
Round up 10 of the strongest.

283
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,629
- We'll need porters.
- Yes, sir.

284
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,194
This guy right here, sir.

285
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,631
Grab him, men. You're coming with me!

286
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,435
<i>Let go of me!</i>

287
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,995
<i>John!</i>

288
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,594
Get off! John!

289
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,712
Must have been something
the first moment you saw her.

290
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,760
After all the negresses and baboons.

291
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,954
<i>John!</i>

292
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,031
Mr. Rom, we'll bring him down.

293
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,832
Go! Go!

294
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,315
Get the Maxims loaded!

295
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
Hurry!

296
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,597
Focus fire on the boilers.
Below the chimney.

297
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,799
Pull away!

298
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,640
Where do you think you're going?

299
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,631
I need you to scream for me.

300
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,678
Like a damsel?

301
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,158
No matter.

302
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,111
He's Tarzan, you're Jane.

303
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,239
He'll come for you.

304
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,155
John! John!

305
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,076
John! John...

306
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,799
They came for me, Kwete.

307
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,393
<i>This was not done by you.</i>

308
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,833
Do you know who they were?

309
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,273
We've heard of whites
that come and fight for money,

310
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,998
do not wear Belgian colors...

311
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,519
Called Force Publique.

312
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,154
The man I interviewed in Belgium
told me about them.

313
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,833
Did anyone mention a man named Rom?

314
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,633
Nobody gave up any names.

315
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,918
But Leon Rom
is King Leopold's envoy to the Congo.

316
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,595
Any other revelations?

317
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,193
Not from me.

318
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,600
Why do you say they came to get you?

319
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,193
The boat is traveling upstream,
which will slow it down.

320
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,470
We should get to Mbonga's mountain
before them

321
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,552
if we take this route
through the Mangani lands.

322
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,936
How do you know where they're going?

323
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,110
- This route...
- It's longer.

324
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,120
But it is where
they are building the railroad.

325
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,838
We can ride it part of the way.

326
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,240
Good.

327
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,508
John?

328
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,719
<i>John?</i>

329
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,479
John!

330
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,555
Fine! I'm still coming with you.

331
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,833
You can't keep up.

332
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,911
I might not be able
to keep up with Tarzan,

333
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,718
but I sure as hell can keep up with you.

334
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,074
It is not wise.

335
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,832
<i>Falling behind means certain death.</i>

336
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,877
I spent over half my life in the wilds.

337
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,235
Besides, nobody here
is better than me with a rifle.

338
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,589
That one right there,

339
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,840
<i>he'd still be choked out
redder than a cardinal's ass</i>

340
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,438
if it weren't for me. And that's...

341
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,313
You think I care about my life?

342
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,754
Get your mitts off me!

343
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,669
- If you had just...
- If I'd just what?

344
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,478
Left you in England in your castle?

345
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,793
They have my wife and their families.

346
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,311
Whoever you are,
we're here by royal invitation.

347
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,670
As guests of King Leopold.

348
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,150
Lady Clayton,
I orchestrated the invitation.

349
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,198
And you were not included.

350
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,151
Nor was Dr. Williams.

351
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,351
A tribe of savages
is trying to tear your husband apart

352
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,397
and maybe butcher him and eat him.

353
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,116
<i>And I'm going to deliver him to them.</i>

354
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,760
<i>And once they've dispatched with him,</i>

355
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,189
<i>Dr. Williams
will not be left as a witness,</i>

356
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,588
that's clear.

357
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,831
Which begs the question,

358
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,797
where does that leave you?

359
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,792
You'll notice
none of the natives are smiling.

360
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,031
That one's your friend?

361
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,240
They all are.

362
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,915
You do know
that the right side of your mustache

363
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,435
is just a little lower than the left?

364
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,833
<i>John!</i>

365
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,558
<i>John!</i>

366
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,120
Different kind of wilds.

367
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,628
How are we supposed to catch
a train going 40 miles an hour?

368
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,673
Gravity.

369
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,509
Shit!

370
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,113
Climb on my back.

371
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,599
Right. Legs, too.

372
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,113
Don't think for a second
you're saving my life.

373
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,070
Give me the keys to the chains.

374
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,360
Are you the commander?

375
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,435
Don't tell him anything.

376
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,672
Those are some mighty big earlobes
you got there, son.

377
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,235
Do you think that was a lucky shot?

378
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,520
I'm just an engineer for the bridge.

379
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,633
And how many men
have been enslaved to build your bridge?

380
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,433
Eight hundred.

381
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,989
Plus, this group of natives.

382
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,311
Please, I'm here to build bridges
for <i>Monsieur</i> Rom's new army.

383
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,674
I have no part in that.

384
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,909
What army?

385
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,955
<i>The railroads,</i>

386
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,111
combined with the navigable rivers

387
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:59,756
put 60% of Congo
within three days of a fort.

388
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,593
The forts are done,
but the army has not come.

389
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,988
Where are they?

390
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,269
I don't know.

391
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,560
They were supposed to be here months ago.

392
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,549
But they said
the King is yet to pay for them.

393
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,153
How many are there?

394
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,754
Twenty thousand.

395
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,316
And they are not regular soldiers.

396
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,271
They are mercenaries.

397
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,870
Known to enjoy killing for a living.

398
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,996
Twenty thousand men, 50 forts.

399
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,631
That's 400 bloodthirsty bastards
armed with a Maxim gun

400
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,791
and repeating rifles at each one.

401
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,794
<i>He'll end up enslaving the entire country
to get what he wants.</i>

402
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,152
People won't stand a chance.

403
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,511
What is Mr. Rom's part in this?

404
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,911
It's his plan.
He is in charge of all of it.

405
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,797
They expect
he will be named Governor General soon.

406
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,159
<i>No, no, no. Wait!</i>

407
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,878
Wait! Please!

408
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,312
Shut it, clucker!

409
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,756
Now, if you do
anything unladylike in there,

410
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,792
he drowns.

411
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,752
<i>Enjoying your peep show?</i>

412
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,516
Of course I know
you can see me, Lady Clayton.

413
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,195
Are you a religious man, Mr. Rom?

414
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,828
Oh. No. Madagascar spider silk.

415
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,674
My priest purchased it for me
in Jerusalem

416
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,478
when I was nine.

417
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,193
Sounds like you and your priest
were awfully close.

418
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,915
Why?

419
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,954
I want you to know,

420
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,476
I think your husband
had no right to bring you along.

421
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,868
I brought myself, Mr. Rom.

422
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,234
Of course.

423
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,868
But he was supposed to be
the only casualty.

424
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,828
Aside from the entire country of people
you're enslaving, of course.

425
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,360
Would you pass the pepper?

426
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,190
It can also serve as a necklace.

427
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,748
On my last visit to Europe,
I attended a few lectures at the Sorbonne.

428
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,398
The King of France got a soft clap.

429
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,710
Henry Morton Stanley,
a bastard orphan by birth,

430
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,472
got a standing ovation.

431
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,997
People love a good story.

432
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,315
Yeah, a few are born blue bloods,
like your husband.

433
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,428
But everyone can relate
to a low-born scrapper

434
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,269
who rescued his king from bankruptcy
and saved the honor of his nation.

435
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,829
That is a man who will never be forgotten.

436
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,120
My king's army is due in six days.

437
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,791
All I've left to do
is deliver Tarzan to Chief Mbonga.

438
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,910
Yeah,
I'd hoped you'd recognize the name.

439
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,471
I'm aware of his obsessive desire
to kill your husband,

440
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,551
but I've yet to discover the cause.

441
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,995
What did Tarzan do?

442
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,996
He killed his only son.

443
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,758
- Oh.
- Hmm.

444
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:51,159
And get ready, because that is nothing
compared to what he will do to you.

445
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,194
Your husband's wildness disturbs me
more than I can easily express.

446
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,240
Whereas your spirit...

447
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,548
My knife, please.

448
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,553
Slowly.

449
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,751
Your friend won't float.

450
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,553
Thank you.

451
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,076
Lady Clayton's finished.

452
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,199
A normal man can do the impossible
to save the woman he loves.

453
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,038
My husband is no normal man.

454
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,478
<i>You cannot go alone.</i>

455
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,835
They'd consider seven a raid.

456
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,272
<i>None of us would survive.</i>

457
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,877
This says it's against the law
to pay natives to work.

458
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,510
And this is the ledger
of all the slaves taken so far.

459
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,029
<i>Slave labor, diamonds everywhere.</i>

460
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,079
Rom's going to make his monarch
the richest king in the world.

461
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,720
Dr. Williams, you have your evidence.

462
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,550
I'll take care of Rom.

463
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,790
Well, I have no choice.

464
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,552
We'd lose two days going around.

465
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,154
- Going around what?
- Mangani.

466
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,788
Those gorillas you used to live with?

467
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,154
They're not gorillas.

468
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,880
Gorillas are gentle. Mangani are not.

469
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,833
I never left a friend in trouble,
or a partner in the lurch.

470
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,195
I'm not about to start now.

471
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,794
Stop calling me "doctor."
My name's George.

472
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,517
We'll keep your proof safe, George.

473
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,680
I know.

474
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,392
Meet us in Boma.

475
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,160
If we don't make it back...

476
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,629
We will. With your families.

477
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,560
...get the books
to my grandfather in London.

478
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,040
Still not waiting for you.

479
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,520
Tell me something I didn't know.

480
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,669
What I wouldn't give
for a horse right now.

481
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,156
Why is it people don't ride zebras?

482
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,870
Well, horses kick to escape.

483
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,996
Zebras continue until you're dead.

484
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,616
"Zee-bra," "zeb-ra."
"Tom-ay-to," "to-mah-to."

485
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,359
<i>It's nearly impossible to take the wild
out of something born to it.</i>

486
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,118
It seemed to have worked with you.

487
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,632
Look, I feel foolish for asking,

488
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,754
but can you really talk to the animals?

489
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,390
You're an educated man, Dr. Williams.
You tell me.

490
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,438
Hey! Hey, pretty lady!

491
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,311
That's a male.

492
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,232
He's warning us to stay clear.

493
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,075
You're trying to tell me
those things are deadly?

494
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,136
If you get too close,
he'll knock you to the ground

495
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,469
and disembowel you
with those three-inch talons.

496
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,632
No ostrich is going to kill me.

497
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,358
Well, then try and ride him.

498
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,154
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

499
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,520
Oh...

500
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,829
<i>Damn!
That is one odious aroma. Whew, God!</i>

501
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,797
<i>Keep your voice low.</i>

502
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,593
Is that them?

503
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,399
You don't want to do that, George.

504
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,793
Kill one, and the rest won't stop
until they have torn you to pieces.

505
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,760
So how do you want to play this, then?

506
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:55,636
Their leader will come down,
and we'll fight.

507
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,198
You're going to fight one of those?

508
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,477
<i>I wish. I have to fight Akut.</i>

509
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,111
He was my brother once.

510
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,273
And now he'll consider me a deserter.

511
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,276
Whatever happens, do not interfere.

512
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,479
Understand?

513
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,560
Mmm-hmm.

514
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,508
Christ Almighty.

515
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,999
That's Akut?

516
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,195
You sure you don't want me to shoot him?

517
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,479
Promise me.

518
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,876
Get on your knees and bow.

519
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,271
<i>Right now!</i>

520
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,956
Expose your most vulnerable parts!

521
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,270
You want me
to lick his nuts, too?

522
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,953
If you want to live.

523
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,794
<i>George...</i>

524
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,109
I wasn't going to!

525
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,473
Well, it looked like you were.

526
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,479
<i>Is he coming back?</i>

527
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:57,110
No. It was quite decisive.

528
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,748
If this bite gets infected,
you're going to have problems.

529
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,320
Then there is this.

530
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,395
Now, you know
I was not going to lick his...

531
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,600
It looked like you were.

532
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,040
Well, I wasn't.

533
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,835
You aren't going anywhere
until we get this stitched up.

534
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,517
Are you eating them?

535
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,395
- Tastes like bacon.
- Ew.

536
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,675
You get us a nice, fat snake,
I'd grub on that.

537
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,150
Snake's good meat.
I ain't eating no damn ant.

538
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,072
Well, suit yourself.

539
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,593
And when you're finished,

540
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,076
chew the flowers into a poultice
and wipe it on the cut with a rubber.

541
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,839
It'll hold.

542
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,016
Are you aware that you always say

543
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,136
you're not going to do something
right before you do it?

544
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,116
Yeah? Well...

545
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,400
That's only since
I've been saddled with your company.

546
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,034
How is it?

547
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,832
It's manageable.

548
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,754
Pain...

549
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,110
I got too much experience with it.

550
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,235
The Civil War was dark fighting.

551
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,757
But I was proud to be part of it.

552
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,917
Changed me, though.

553
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,635
Afterward, I was
a walking, talking powder keg.

554
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,591
Joined up to fight
Maximilian down in Mexico.

555
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:43,029
Then worked as an Indian fighter.

556
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,550
Did both those for the money.

557
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,672
<i>I was young.</i>

558
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,397
But that's no excuse.

559
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,152
Mexico was bad.

560
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,475
But what we did to the Indians...

561
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,471
I'm no better than those Belgians.

562
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,479
My old friend.

563
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,788
<i>The Teke say an elephant's eyes
speak the greatest language.</i>

564
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,398
What else can make you feel so much
without a word?

565
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,877
Is Mr. Rom ready
for some more scintillating conversation?

566
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,829
He was the only reason
you weren't serviced.

567
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,632
Serviced?

568
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,756
Is that what your mother would call it?

569
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,595
Shut your mouth!

570
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,631
<i>Stop the boat! Stop the boat!</i>

571
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,279
Turn it around!

572
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,992
Stop shooting! You'll hit the girl!

573
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,559
That woman.

574
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,720
Wait!

575
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,593
They'll follow my tracks. Go and get help.

576
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,880
Go!

577
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,436
Promise you won't hurt them?

578
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,835
No! Stop!

579
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,757
<i>Please, stop!</i>

580
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,360
John!

581
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,353
<i>Stop! Stop it! Stop!</i>

582
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,274
Stop it! Please!

583
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,990
Please! Please!

584
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,195
Come on!

585
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,679
<i>Move out!</i>

586
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,510
<i>What was that?</i>

587
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,195
<i>Tarzan.</i>

588
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,070
Although it sounded
different than I thought.

589
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,400
<i>Better.</i>

590
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,115
Schmidt-Rubin.

591
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,434
John!

592
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,520
<i>John!</i>

593
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,360
<i>Stop!</i>

594
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,474
<i>John!</i>

595
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,918
Now, you feel my pain.

596
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,760
<i>I'm not your enemy.</i>

597
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,876
Rom's buying an army with your jewels.

598
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,600
- They cannot touch us!
- You know nothing!

599
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,752
Your lands are full of diamonds.
He'll come back for them.

600
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,192
Your chief is under my knife!

601
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,393
<i>You are under my knife!</i>

602
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,112
Finish it.

603
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,679
Finish it!

604
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:11,955
Stop!

605
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,992
Your son killed the only person
who ever cared about me.

606
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,235
It was an animal.

607
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:26,153
She was my mother.

608
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,873
<i>How was he to know?</i>

609
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,394
My son was just a boy!

610
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,832
Not like you!

611
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,996
Where was your honor?

612
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,872
I had none.

613
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,473
I had none.

614
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,680
<i>Can we please just stop this?</i>

615
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:46,549
We won't get all of you, or you us.

616
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,789
But Rom will.

617
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,711
<i>He'll wipe you out.</i>

618
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,316
<i>Every last one of you.
Like you never even existed.</i>

619
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,156
You think that's impossible?

620
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,314
You're looking at a man
that's seen it happen.

621
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,348
Rom's got the diamonds.

622
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,313
There's 1,000 men down there
and 20,000 more on the way.

623
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,269
We're screwed.

624
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,515
Where are you going?

625
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,999
To get some friends.

626
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,712
All men, stations!

627
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,758
It doesn't matter. He's too late.

628
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,358
Move! Move!

629
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,714
<i>Fall back!</i>

630
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,592
Bring her!

631
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,075
Grab the diamonds.

632
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,955
Run!

633
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:25,198
John! No! No! John!

634
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:28,560
<i>John!</i>

635
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,796
Get to the boat! Move!

636
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,518
We're coming! Hang on!

637
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:57,829
John?

638
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,719
<i>That's the payment.</i>

639
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,430
Lower the skiff, and don't dally.

640
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,753
<i>Did you see him there?
Is he down there?</i>

641
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,950
1886 model Maxim machine gun.

642
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,279
This is way better than my Walker Colts.

643
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:02,795
<i>Mr. Rom!</i>

644
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,392
Mr. Frum, you portly coward!

645
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,630
<i>Come and get your diamonds!</i>

646
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,835
Farewell, sweet lord.

647
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,156
Take Tarzan with you.

648
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,837
The future belongs to me.

649
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,915
What was that?

650
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:54,908
Mating call.

651
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:43,948
Tarzan!

652
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,238
