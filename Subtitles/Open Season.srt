1
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,451
Now, that's a roar, Boog.

2
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:26,659
Now get in. We're gonna be late.

3
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:32,866
No denying. The girl's got growl.
But can she get down like this?

4
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:35,768
Can you get down like this?
Bring it here. Bring it.

5
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:38,705
Then bring it right back, huh?
Look at that. Look at that.

6
00:01:53,558 --> 00:01:55,185
Here it comes.

7
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:44,073
Hey, Gordy.

8
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:46,771
Morning, Beth.

9
00:02:56,621 --> 00:03:00,057
Welcome to Timberline's
Wilderness Extravaganza.

10
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:02,750
I'm Ranger Beth.

11
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:05,657
Please, put your hands together
for Boog.

12
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,993
Behold, the mighty grizzly.

13
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:25,477
<i>You can say I'm in love</i>
<i>You could say I'm insane</i>

14
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,677
<i>But no one understands me</i>
<i>Like my darling Lorraine</i>

15
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:42,290
Looks like you're going
from one grill to another.

16
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:47,031
We rocked that house,
didn't we, Boog?

17
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:51,039
They were eating out of our hands.
Well, my hands, your paws.

18
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,144
Eating out of your paw.

19
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:58,615
That's good.
That's going in the show.

20
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:03,984
Shaw.
That guy really chaps my khakis.

21
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:06,248
You wait here, Boog.

22
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:10,817
- Cuff him, Gordy.
- Oh, the Girl Scouts are here.

23
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:12,485
He's at it again.

24
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:16,564
Shaw, hunting season doesn't start
for three days.

25
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:19,033
What are you doing
with that buck on your hood?

26
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:23,664
What? It ain't my fault.
He ran right in front of my truck.

27
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:25,810
Where, on the interstate?

28
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:31,974
Sort of.

29
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:37,453
Where is that girl?

30
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,929
That's nasty.

31
00:04:57,008 --> 00:05:00,967
What? What the--?
What's going on? Where am I?

32
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:04,843
I saw a bright light and--
I saw two bright lights and...

33
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:07,849
- Am I dead?
- Not yet.

34
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:09,953
But seeing how
that is Shaw's truck--

35
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,885
- What's a Shaw?
- Only the nastiest hunter in town.

36
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:15,787
A hunter? Did he get you too?

37
00:05:16,494 --> 00:05:18,257
You don't see me tied up,
do you, baby?

38
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,194
- This is my ride.
- Your ride?

39
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:22,799
Yeah, this is my town, okay?

40
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:26,232
These are my people.
This is where I reside.

41
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:30,772
Nobody's hunting this bear.

42
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:36,373
Really? Well, then untie me.
Please? Look, no one's looking.

43
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:38,846
- Ain't gonna be able to do it.
- What am I gonna do?

44
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:41,417
I don't wanna be mounted on a wall.

45
00:05:41,586 --> 00:05:43,816
- Calm down. Ain't gonna happen.
- It's not?

46
00:05:43,988 --> 00:05:48,550
- Not with that rack.
- I don't have a problem with--

47
00:05:48,726 --> 00:05:51,126
My... It's...

48
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,563
I'm a unihorn. Don't look at me.
Don't look at me.

49
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:59,066
I'm hideous. I'm a monster.

50
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:00,238
- Tree-hugger.
- Knuckle dragger.

51
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:02,035
- Tree-hugger.
- Knuckle dragger.

52
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:03,469
Veggieburger.

53
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:05,734
All right, all right.
That's enough, you two.

54
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,208
Listen, Girl Scout,
they're dumb animals.

55
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:14,011
I'm just respecting the natural order:
man on top, animals on the bottom.

56
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:17,780
But your bear--
Now, now, your bear is special.

57
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:20,924
He belongs somewhere
in the middle.

58
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:25,119
Between two slices of rye,
smothered in gravy.

59
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:29,932
You're a sick, sick,
twisted puppy, Shaw.

60
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:35,171
Put me down for a box of Thin Mints,
will you, sweetie?

61
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:40,604
Six-toed gun monkey.
Boog, come on, let's get out of here.

62
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:45,607
Come on, I'm begging you.
Please, please. Just untie me.

63
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:48,718
Come on. Please, please, please?

64
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:55,954
Hey, go on now. Scamper on
back to the woods, little buddy.

65
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,660
Little one-horned freak.

66
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,859
Buddy? He called me "buddy."

67
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:09,939
My buck.

68
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:14,508
My truck. Why, you little--

69
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,977
Shaw, no shooting in town.

70
00:07:17,148 --> 00:07:21,380
But, Gordy, that bear leaned over
and untied my buck.

71
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:26,013
- Didn't you see that?
- All I see is a busted headlight.

72
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:31,218
Shaw, you've been living
in the woods too long.

73
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:39,760
They can't tell me what I seen,
because only I know what I seen.

74
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:45,104
<i>Wheel of Fortune!</i>

75
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:51,240
Big money got to come. Come on.

76
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,647
- Okay, buddy, time for bed.
- <i>Five hundred--</i>

77
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,912
- <i>There's no R--</i>
- Boog.

78
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:59,318
Mr. Dinkleman's waiting.

79
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:12,763
Good night, big guy.

80
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:18,404
Oh, did I forget something?

81
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:26,942
No, no, no. No more treats for you.

82
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:29,518
No, stop it.

83
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:33,919
Not the face.
Oh, no, not the eyebrows too.

84
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:37,027
No, it's not gonna work this time.
Stop it. I'm serious, Boog.

85
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:41,529
It's cute, but no-- All right.

86
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:49,638
<i>If you go out in the woods today</i>
<i>You're sure of a big surprise</i>

87
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:54,870
<i>If you go out in the woods today</i>
<i>You'd better go in disguise</i>

88
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:57,412
<i>For every bear</i>
<i>That ever there was</i>

89
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:00,243
<i>Will gather there together because</i>

90
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:02,215
<i>Today's the day</i>

91
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:09,452
<i>The teddy bears have their picnic</i>

92
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:12,192
Good night, Boog.

93
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:22,037
Who's there?

94
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:28,604
I'm warning you. I got ten claws
and I ain't afraid to use them.

95
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,409
- Hey, buddy. It's me, Elliot.
- What are you doing here?

96
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,346
You helped me,
I'm returning the favor.

97
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,147
I'm busting you out of here.
Let's go. Let's do this.

98
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:40,451
Come on. Let's book it before
the warden makes her rounds.

99
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,560
No, cornflake.
You've got it all twisted.

100
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:48,995
- This here is my home.
- Sweet.

101
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,260
Now haul your little butt
back out that window.

102
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:53,370
- What's this?
- Get off of that.

103
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:57,873
So soft. What is that?

104
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,606
What are you doing in there?

105
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:03,571
This place is big enough for two.

106
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:06,046
- What?
- Wow, look at that.

107
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:08,549
Does this look natural?

108
00:10:09,353 --> 00:10:11,821
- Give me that.
- Oh, who's this little guy?

109
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:14,480
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman?

110
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:17,150
Is Dinkleman your doll?

111
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:20,092
I don't care about that old thing.

112
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:27,198
Oh, I get it. You're like a pet.

113
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:31,068
- I ain't nobody's pet.
- Right.

114
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:35,201
I do what I want, when I want,
and I come and go as I please.

115
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:37,506
Well, then let's go.

116
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:41,278
Outside?

117
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:45,684
Why would I wanna go outside
when I got all I need in...

118
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:49,622
Whoa, what's that?

119
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:51,887
I call them Woo Hoos, like:

120
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:54,592
You want one?

121
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:58,429
I know where there's a bunch of them,
but you gotta go...

122
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,634
...outside.

123
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:06,877
Inside. Outside.

124
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:09,308
- Inside. Outside.
- Stop it.

125
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,246
- Stupid nose.
- Inside. Outsi--

126
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:29,630
Okay, I got that Woo Hoo right out of
one of those container doohickeys.

127
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,292
You got that out the garbage?

128
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:35,570
I had that in my mouth
and everything.

129
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:39,005
Dude, you're freaking me out
with that nose thing.

130
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:43,675
- Whoa.
- What is it?

131
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:47,306
- It's a whole Woo Hoo village.
- Sweet.

132
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:52,451
It's locked. Maybe we should
come back tomorrow.

133
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:53,920
Hey.

134
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:58,690
Elliot, look what you... You did.

135
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:01,730
You gonna get us in some trouble.

136
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:06,102
The Woo Hoo bar.

137
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,239
She's my lady. Smooth and creamy.

138
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:12,638
So bad, I shouldn't. Yet I will.

139
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:24,113
What is that?

140
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:26,119
Whoa, let me try.

141
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:32,722
Boog. Boog?

142
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:38,462
- Hello, idiot.
- It's "Elliot."

143
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:03,687
I come in peace.

144
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:30,320
I'm foraging.

145
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:32,045
Pepperoni!

146
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,236
- All right. Yeah, there it is. Let's go.
- Boog, party's over, let's go.

147
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,075
- All right, yeah, there it is.
- Freeze.

148
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:02,278
Behold, the mighty grizzly.
Good night.

149
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,636
<i>If you go out in the woods today</i>
<i>There's gonna be some fries</i>

150
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:26,805
Yeah, and the giraffes...

151
00:14:26,978 --> 00:14:30,505
...they taste almost exactly
like the elephants.

152
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:32,876
That's messed up.

153
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,745
Hey, Gordy.

154
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:41,721
Back up quick, before she sees me.

155
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,531
You're in big trouble, mister.

156
00:14:54,138 --> 00:14:57,232
You know what sugar does
to you, Boog.

157
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:59,876
Straight to bed, now!

158
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:05,809
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.
It won't happen again.

159
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,645
- What if he had hurt someone?
- Gordy, please.

160
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:12,482
- We're talking about Boog here.
- Hey, what are you looking at?

161
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:14,851
I told you not to wait up.

162
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:19,019
- I'll take him back to the woods.
- It's time to put him where he belongs.

163
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:22,996
No, no, he's not ready to go back yet.
I mean, it's not my fault.

164
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:26,068
I tried to teach him the basics.

165
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:29,638
I took him fishing,
but he didn't wanna get wet.

166
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:33,009
Gordy, please--

167
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:39,414
Boog is sorry.

168
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:44,010
- Beth, you're not his mother.
- I'm not mothering him.

169
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:49,085
Excuse me. Go to bed, Boog!

170
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:56,628
One more summer.

171
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:58,826
That's all I'm asking,
one summer.

172
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:02,497
Great, see? I can be reasonable.
Thanks.

173
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:04,641
You know something?

174
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:09,075
The longer you wait, the harder
it's gonna be for him to adapt.

175
00:16:09,513 --> 00:16:13,882
Oh, I'm sure he'll...
At least I think he'll--

176
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:17,077
And the harder it's gonna be
for you to let him go.

177
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:23,419
Good night, Beth.

178
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:47,482
What am I gonna do with you?

179
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:03,833
This isn't decaf. You know
what caffeine does to me, Bob.

180
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:06,595
I'd be talking up a storm,
chatting your ear off...

181
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,567
...a mile a minute
for the whole ride.

182
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:15,405
Mr. Weenie, heel. Heel, Mr. Weenie.

183
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:18,815
Hot.

184
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:26,179
It's terrible but wonderful
at the same time.

185
00:17:26,357 --> 00:17:28,450
It's like freedom in a cup.

186
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:31,293
Out of hand.

187
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,694
You know, I heard Boog got loose
last night...

188
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:43,464
...and he totally trashed the place.

189
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:45,131
- Really?
- That's what happened.

190
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:47,971
There's something wrong
going on here.

191
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:55,783
You? It walks like a man.

192
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:06,893
Hold still,
you two-legged latte drinker.

193
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:08,292
Look out!

194
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:15,002
Not again.

195
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:17,766
Boog will have you eating out
of his paw.

196
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:23,236
Get it?
"Paw," because he's a bear?

197
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:27,282
- So anyway...
- Oh, man.

198
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:31,182
Okay, relax, Boog.
You can do this.

199
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,650
- What the--?
- I gotta hide. I gotta hide.

200
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:38,488
What are you doing?
Get out of here. Hey.

201
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:41,062
He's right behind me.

202
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:47,064
I knew it.
That bear's corrupted my buck.

203
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:49,195
Hide me.

204
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:57,410
- All right, he's gone. Now get out.
- Good idea.

205
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:00,311
- Where you going?
- Behold, the mighty grizzly.

206
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:08,689
How cute, a donkey.

207
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:14,989
- You got me in enough trouble.
- Hey, I-- You saved my life.

208
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:17,429
That means
that you're responsible for me.

209
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:19,865
What? Stop messing up my life.

210
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:22,062
You needed to get out.
You should thank me.

211
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,469
- Thank you?
- You're welcome, buddy.

212
00:19:24,642 --> 00:19:27,110
Stop calling me that. Now get out.

213
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:28,870
Need to hide. Need to hide.

214
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:31,041
Boog?

215
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:33,808
Oh, no, you don't.
You're leaving now.

216
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,713
- Out of the coat. Take it off.
- No. No!

217
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:37,820
- Take off the coat.
- No means no.

218
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,418
- He's eating the donkey.
- He's gonna eat us all.

219
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:44,993
You know he's still out there.

220
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:48,256
Eat you? He's not gonna--
Boog, what are you doing?

221
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:49,990
Put that animal down this instant.

222
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:53,232
- Hold still.
- No, I'm staying.

223
00:19:53,404 --> 00:19:54,632
But my show!

224
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:56,898
Sit, Boog. You're getting a time-out.

225
00:19:57,074 --> 00:19:59,133
Do you hear me?
I'm totally getting angry.

226
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,744
That guy wants to kill me.

227
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,475
No, wait.

228
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:10,119
- I chipped a hoof.
- Chipped a--?

229
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:12,778
You chipped a-- I'm gonna kill you.

230
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:17,017
He's harmless. Really.
Stay calm. Stay calm!

231
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:18,718
Out of my way. Move.

232
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:21,626
Show's over,
you four-legged freaks of nature.

233
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:30,836
Perfect.

234
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:32,805
Shaw. Drop that gun.

235
00:20:32,976 --> 00:20:36,173
You're ruining my show.

236
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:39,077
Easy, now. Just line them up.

237
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:42,980
Two heads, one bullet.

238
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:51,761
Buttermilk biscuits.

239
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:08,203
Shaw, you're under arrest.

240
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:10,773
Shaw?

241
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:20,723
Gordy, I didn't know
what else to do. I--

242
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:23,257
It's time, Beth.

243
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:25,292
But what about hunting season?

244
00:21:25,462 --> 00:21:28,432
Take him above the falls.
He'll be safe there.

245
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,490
Take him above the falls.
He'll be safe there.

246
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:10,530
You're gonna be...

247
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:13,865
You're gonna be fine.

248
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:19,872
I'm gonna miss you, big guy.

249
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:07,051
Pretty.

250
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:19,264
Where's home? It's gone.

251
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:21,631
Someone stole it.

252
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:25,402
Hey, could you keep it down?

253
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:28,443
I'm trying to sleep here.

254
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:32,873
You.

255
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,280
- No, I didn't do it.
- Take a good look, Elliot.

256
00:24:35,452 --> 00:24:37,784
What do you see, Elliot?
Something's missing, Elliot.

257
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:39,388
What is it, Elliot? What is it?

258
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:41,683
Wait, don't tell me. I...

259
00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:43,416
Timberline is missing!

260
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:46,188
- I was just gonna say that.
- My garage is missing.

261
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:48,627
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner
are missing.

262
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,827
My life is missing,
and it's all your fault.

263
00:24:54,004 --> 00:24:56,404
What are you gonna do?

264
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:04,379
You're funny.

265
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:08,416
I thought, "Maybe," but then
I was like... and then--

266
00:25:08,785 --> 00:25:11,310
This ain't happening.
It's some kind of mistake.

267
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:14,150
Think, Boog. She's mad,
but you can fix this.

268
00:25:14,324 --> 00:25:16,622
All right, I'll go back
and I'll give her the face.

269
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:18,420
The face.

270
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:21,723
Gotta get back before
she forgets the face.

271
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:25,493
That'll clear it all up right there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the face.

272
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:31,135
Boog!

273
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:34,341
You can't just go wandering
around out here.

274
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:36,342
You don't know where you're going,
Boog!

275
00:25:36,513 --> 00:25:37,912
I'm going home.

276
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:40,743
Wait. Boog.

277
00:25:41,118 --> 00:25:43,211
I know where Timberline is.

278
00:25:43,387 --> 00:25:47,221
- I can get you back.
- Thank you, but no thank you.

279
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,687
Quiet.

280
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:55,996
Timberline's gotta be
around here somewhere.

281
00:25:58,468 --> 00:26:00,663
Well, that was quick.

282
00:26:04,408 --> 00:26:08,708
Now, let's see.
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

283
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,548
Boog, is that you?

284
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:30,290
Boog.

285
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,401
Okay, I gotta get the lay of the land.

286
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:44,513
Somehow...

287
00:26:45,115 --> 00:26:47,549
...if I get up high enough, then...

288
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:50,719
All right.

289
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:53,082
I can do this.

290
00:26:53,457 --> 00:26:55,925
No problem.

291
00:26:59,563 --> 00:27:02,157
Lost your way to Sunday school, pal?

292
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:05,859
This is McSquizzy's turf.
Nobody messes with McSquizzy.

293
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:07,799
Because that's me.

294
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:09,939
- What?
- Touch a needle in this tree...

295
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:13,304
- ...and I'll give you such a doing!
- Yeah?

296
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:15,604
You and what army?

297
00:27:17,781 --> 00:27:19,078
Oh, that army.

298
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:21,479
Mess not with the furrytail clan.

299
00:27:21,651 --> 00:27:25,109
Defenders of the good,
crusaders of the righteous...

300
00:27:25,288 --> 00:27:27,518
...guardians of the pine.

301
00:27:28,992 --> 00:27:31,927
Keep your tree. I'll find another one.

302
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:37,399
Look! He's got a wee freakish twin
growing out of his back.

303
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:45,772
Oh, this one will work.

304
00:27:45,942 --> 00:27:48,968
Hey. That was a warning, all right?

305
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,140
Try that again, and I'll be kicking
your furry brown bahookie!

306
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:55,307
- What?
- Hey, this is a different tree.

307
00:27:55,485 --> 00:27:57,112
They're all my trees.

308
00:27:57,287 --> 00:28:00,415
I suggest you turn round and head
right back from whence you came.

309
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,491
That's what I'm trying to do.
So just point me the way to town...

310
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,525
...and I'll be out of here.

311
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:13,362
That's it.
You're asking for a whooping.

312
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,069
Ready!

313
00:28:15,238 --> 00:28:16,728
Fire!

314
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:21,834
Hey, Boog, look. No hands.

315
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:23,809
I think I'm getting a sunburn,
though.

316
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,242
Check it out.

317
00:28:27,717 --> 00:28:29,014
All right, where's town?

318
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:32,815
Or what we would call this,
a moon burn.

319
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:36,791
Look, just give me the directions.

320
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,257
I really need to get back.

321
00:28:38,428 --> 00:28:39,690
So sad.

322
00:28:39,863 --> 00:28:43,458
- Where's Timberline?
- Okay. Okay. All right.

323
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,260
You got it good
in Timberline, right?

324
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:48,996
Coffee, Woo Hoo bars, safety.

325
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:52,539
- Yeah, so?
- And still, something is missing.

326
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:54,404
- There is?
- Yep. Me.

327
00:28:54,578 --> 00:28:56,569
And I want in, Boog.
I'll take you to town...

328
00:28:56,746 --> 00:28:58,839
...but when we get there,
we're partners.

329
00:28:59,015 --> 00:29:01,006
Deal, partner?

330
00:29:01,184 --> 00:29:03,982
What? Oh, no, no, no.

331
00:29:04,154 --> 00:29:06,213
That ain't never
gonna happen. Never.

332
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:08,357
Don't you have a herd
to get back to?

333
00:29:08,525 --> 00:29:12,427
What--? My herd?
They-- My herd will understand.

334
00:29:12,596 --> 00:29:14,689
These guys are my--
They're my buddies.

335
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:17,698
- They-- They want the best for me.
- Forget it.

336
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:21,633
Oh, well.
Better start moving, then.

337
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:23,898
Because open season starts
in a few days.

338
00:29:24,074 --> 00:29:26,508
Maybe one of those hunters
can give you a ride back...

339
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:29,076
...on the hood of their truck.

340
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:32,805
Hunters. Dang.

341
00:29:35,318 --> 00:29:37,513
- Okay, okay.
- So we have a deal, then?

342
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:39,985
Okay, let me hear you say it.

343
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:46,389
- Partners?
- You're disgusting.

344
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:48,861
- What was that?
- I...

345
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:52,964
- Sorry, can't hear you.
- I said, I guess...

346
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:54,694
...we can be partners.

347
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:57,362
Partners?

348
00:30:00,944 --> 00:30:03,003
Partners.

349
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:05,739
Okey-dokey, this way!
Move it or lose it!

350
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:08,009
You know, we should have
a secret handshake...

351
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:10,948
...and like nicknames and stuff.
Like, cool nicknames, though.

352
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:12,520
I'll call you Boogster...

353
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:15,055
...and then you can call me
The Incredible Mister E.

354
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:17,284
Isn't that great?
I came up with that myself.

355
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,724
I made that up. You know,
this is gonna be awesome.

356
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:21,363
It's just you and me.

357
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:24,523
Hey, who's the lady in the shorts?

358
00:30:37,347 --> 00:30:39,611
I hope I'm not too late.

359
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:42,177
They've been out here all night.

360
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:44,343
A bear...

361
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:47,217
...and a deer, working together.

362
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:49,252
How far does this conspiracy go?

363
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:52,088
What other animals are involved?
God bless America!

364
00:30:52,262 --> 00:30:55,231
I hope the bald eagle hasn't turned.

365
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:57,593
No, no, no.

366
00:30:57,767 --> 00:30:59,758
Maybe they're right.

367
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:03,303
Maybe... Maybe old Shaw is crazy.

368
00:31:03,473 --> 00:31:06,499
Yeah, maybe.

369
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:18,821
Isn't it peaceful out here, Bob?

370
00:31:19,356 --> 00:31:22,154
You're right, Bob. Let's not spoil
the beauty of this moment...

371
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:23,553
...with idle chatter.

372
00:31:23,727 --> 00:31:26,389
Some people can just jibber-jabber
till the cows come home.

373
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:29,999
What does that mean, Bob?
"Till the cows come home."

374
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,464
Where have the cows been?

375
00:31:42,746 --> 00:31:46,375
Okay, Forest 101.

376
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:48,642
These big wood stick things
are called trees.

377
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:54,383
The big rocks are called mountains,
and the little rocks are their babies.

378
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:58,559
Altitude.

379
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:03,462
No jelly arm, no jelly arm. Come on.

380
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:07,592
- Elliot!
- Boogster, it's...

381
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:09,102
How many times must I say it?

382
00:32:09,272 --> 00:32:11,797
I am the Incredible Mister E.

383
00:32:11,975 --> 00:32:13,374
Elliot, please.

384
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:15,602
Look, if you don't use
the code names...

385
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:18,873
...how am I supposed to know that
it's really you that I'm talking to?

386
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:34,355
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I got it.

387
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:36,829
Nice and easy.

388
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:42,133
Just rip it off fast, like a Band-Aid.

389
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:44,034
Hold still, okay?

390
00:32:44,207 --> 00:32:46,835
Just be calm.
This might pinch a little.

391
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:51,039
- Get it over with.
- You may wanna cover your ears.

392
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:52,408
Cover my--?

393
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:58,987
Okay, scamper on back
to the woods, little buddy.

394
00:33:01,257 --> 00:33:02,747
Buddy.

395
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:05,793
Okay, ladies, this dam
ain't gonna build itself!

396
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:08,294
Lift that birch.
Swing those pines over here.

397
00:33:08,465 --> 00:33:10,262
Come on. Move it!

398
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:11,695
Yo, O'Toole!

399
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:14,268
- Yeah, boss?
- I want you to cantilever that cedar...

400
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:18,066
...on the bias down by the north end,
you got that?

401
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:21,272
Put a twig in the hole.

402
00:33:21,578 --> 00:33:23,102
Rookie.

403
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:25,337
Take five for lunch!

404
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:29,180
- What do you got?
- Wood.

405
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:31,843
- What do you got?
- Wood.

406
00:33:32,021 --> 00:33:33,886
You wanna trade?

407
00:33:35,592 --> 00:33:37,082
Hey, hey, guys. Check it out.

408
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,320
There goes the largest carnivore
in North America.

409
00:33:40,497 --> 00:33:44,297
- The mighty grizzly.
- And he's a good dancer.

410
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:45,900
We're gonna be in a show.

411
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:51,635
Come here!

412
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,900
Hey, that's my good antler.

413
00:33:54,077 --> 00:33:57,137
Listen, simple. We are not "we."

414
00:33:57,313 --> 00:34:00,805
It's just me.
And we ain't doing no show.

415
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:02,349
- Diva.
- What?

416
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,043
I understand what's going on here.

417
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,279
You're a little crabby
because you're hungry.

418
00:34:06,456 --> 00:34:07,889
I, I...

419
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,987
I think yes.

420
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:15,357
I'm starving!

421
00:34:15,532 --> 00:34:17,432
- Here, try this.
- I can't eat that.

422
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,500
Picky, picky, picky.

423
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:21,603
Well, what do bears eat?

424
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:28,209
Fish. Bears eat fish.

425
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:33,476
All right, fishies, give it up for Boog!

426
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:53,299
Hey, Incredible Mister E.

427
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,835
Yes, Boogster?

428
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:59,532
- I gotta go.
- Well, go.

429
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:01,700
No, I need a toilet.

430
00:35:03,112 --> 00:35:05,842
You know, the think tank.

431
00:35:06,015 --> 00:35:09,507
The log cabin, the johnny
on the spot, the oval office.

432
00:35:10,286 --> 00:35:13,050
- There's none of those things out here.
- Well, what do you do?

433
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:14,747
You know...

434
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:18,083
...I can't remember. But listen.

435
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:24,029
Don't look now, but I see a little bush
with your name written all over it.

436
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,827
A bush? Are you serious?

437
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,027
Go on. It's just like riding a bicycle.

438
00:35:28,204 --> 00:35:30,968
Only you're crapping on it.

439
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:35,403
Show us your "grr" face, nature boy.

440
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:51,516
Hey. What are you doing here?

441
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:53,218
Get out of here.

442
00:35:53,396 --> 00:35:56,797
I'm working here. Now, go.

443
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,364
All right, all right,
you've had your fun.

444
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:02,402
Nothing to see here.
Let the bear do his thing.

445
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:05,004
You believe those guys?

446
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,841
Finished?

447
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:11,338
I bet my nuts
that big hairy choob can't do it.

448
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:14,847
- I'll take a piece of that action.
- What is wrong with you animals?

449
00:36:15,018 --> 00:36:16,315
Perhaps some roughage, buddy?

450
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:17,714
Buddy.

451
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:19,115
Perhaps some privacy.

452
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:21,689
- What are doing on my house?
- This is your house?

453
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:23,086
Oh, I-- I didn't know...

454
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:26,057
- It would be an improvement.
- What did you just say, Rosie?

455
00:36:26,229 --> 00:36:28,254
Nothing. Why you gotta
be so sensitive?

456
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:30,729
- Boogster, what's the deal?
- You watch your mouth...

457
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,697
...or you'll get yourself in trouble.

458
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:34,996
You're just jealous
because you ain't got a man.

459
00:36:35,171 --> 00:36:37,571
I don't know.
Some kind of chick fight.

460
00:36:37,874 --> 00:36:39,239
Elliot, what do I do?

461
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:41,809
Well, that's easy.
You just gotta mark your territory.

462
00:36:41,978 --> 00:36:44,310
- Show them who's boss.
- All right, ladies.

463
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,880
I'm laying down the law.

464
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,450
Unless, of course, they're skunks.

465
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,419
Disgusting.

466
00:36:59,062 --> 00:37:00,757
Giselle.

467
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:03,725
Ridiculous.

468
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:11,071
The woods is no place for a bear.

469
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,234
Ducks? Okay.

470
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:14,808
Look, don't move.

471
00:37:17,313 --> 00:37:19,975
Oh, yeah. Sprucing up.

472
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:23,084
Quick. You guys gotta help me.

473
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,955
Don't mind Deni, monsieur.
He's a bit nervous.

474
00:37:27,123 --> 00:37:29,057
Never been quite...

475
00:37:29,492 --> 00:37:33,861
...right since the great migration.

476
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:39,293
There were thousands of us
when we started in the big V's.

477
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:43,368
Then... Then it happened.

478
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:45,268
What happened?

479
00:37:45,441 --> 00:37:48,877
What happened?
Open season happened.

480
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:51,474
Just me and Deni were left.

481
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:55,048
How can you make a V
with only two duck, you ask, eh?

482
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:57,679
Well, you cannot, monsieur.

483
00:37:57,854 --> 00:38:00,914
It's a tragedy!

484
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:03,915
Yeah, right, whatever.

485
00:38:04,093 --> 00:38:06,357
But check this out.
I'm looking for town.

486
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:09,657
Okay? Now, could one of you guys
fly up there...

487
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:12,494
- ...and show me the way?
- Fly? Fly?

488
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:15,701
Quiet. They'll hear you.

489
00:38:17,006 --> 00:38:18,234
Giselle.

490
00:38:18,408 --> 00:38:20,342
- Elliot?
- Hey, gorgeous.

491
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,343
- How you doing?
- Elliot, where have you been?

492
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:26,038
Oh, you know. Big city.

493
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:29,707
Kind of a road trip. Saw the sights,
hit the buffet, took in a show.

494
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:31,410
Things are looking up, Giselle.

495
00:38:31,587 --> 00:38:34,147
Really? I heard
you got hit by a truck.

496
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,890
That-- Rumor.

497
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,528
You better get out of here.
Remember what happened...

498
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:42,891
- ...last time you talked to me?
- Is Ian around?

499
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:48,697
How long have you had that tic?

500
00:38:49,005 --> 00:38:50,563
I think it's getting worse.

501
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:53,102
Oh, crud.

502
00:38:57,747 --> 00:38:59,977
Hello, "Smelliot."

503
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:04,085
I called him Smelliot.

504
00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:08,445
Herd! Circle formation!

505
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:11,817
You pinheads. That's an oval.

506
00:39:11,994 --> 00:39:14,758
More circle-y!

507
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:17,590
You got a lot of nerve
coming back here.

508
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:21,100
- Why, thank you.
- That was not a compliment, maggot!

509
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,170
Well, he was just going.
Right, Elliot?

510
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:24,601
Yeah, Ian.

511
00:39:24,774 --> 00:39:28,301
I had to stop by and say hello
to some of my old pals.

512
00:39:28,478 --> 00:39:30,469
Bob, Kevin. Jurgen,
how's the knee?

513
00:39:30,646 --> 00:39:34,980
I told you to leave the herd
and never, ever, ever...

514
00:39:35,151 --> 00:39:38,780
- Never?
- Never, ever, ever come back.

515
00:39:38,955 --> 00:39:40,479
Back?

516
00:39:40,957 --> 00:39:42,822
I'm not-- I'm not back.

517
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:45,654
Me and my best buddy
are heading to town.

518
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:49,093
Yeah. I sure am gonna miss
you guys.

519
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:50,562
Off the upholstery!

520
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:53,667
What now?

521
00:39:58,774 --> 00:40:03,973
So as I was saying,
never, ever, ever--

522
00:40:05,314 --> 00:40:07,509
A bear! Bear. Bear. A bear.

523
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:10,911
Elliot, are you all right?

524
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:13,817
Buttermilk biscuit.

525
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:16,514
Hey, Ian. Get a load of this.

526
00:40:16,692 --> 00:40:18,091
Hey, cut it out.

527
00:40:18,261 --> 00:40:20,627
Oh, I've heard of you.

528
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:25,699
You're that bear that got
his butt thumped by a squirrel.

529
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:28,896
It was-- There was 20 of them.

530
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,705
And they had nuts.

531
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,399
Don't listen to him, Boog.

532
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:37,444
Boog? What is that short for?

533
00:40:37,613 --> 00:40:39,843
- Booger?
- Booger!

534
00:40:40,016 --> 00:40:43,349
- Listen, you!
- I'm all ears.

535
00:40:43,886 --> 00:40:46,184
- Well...
- Boog, let's go.

536
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:50,424
You two are perfect for each other.

537
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:54,859
You're a loser and you're a loser-er.

538
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:56,821
Herd, let's bound!

539
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,263
Hey, Elliot.

540
00:41:00,436 --> 00:41:02,904
I think you lost something.

541
00:41:03,406 --> 00:41:06,432
Maybe it'll grow back. Bye, Elliot.

542
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:07,871
Yeah, see you.

543
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:12,036
See you later, backpack boy!

544
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:17,210
That's right, fool. You better run.

545
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:19,786
Keep on prancing,
you panty-waisted cow.

546
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:21,947
Yeah. One more word,
and I was gonna rack him.

547
00:41:22,124 --> 00:41:23,819
- That's right.
- I was waiting for it.

548
00:41:23,993 --> 00:41:25,221
He's scared. He's scared.

549
00:41:25,394 --> 00:41:27,692
- Look at him run. Look at him run.
- Yeah, I know it.

550
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:29,194
Look at him go.

551
00:41:29,365 --> 00:41:31,765
Are you not gonna buy him a drink
before you kiss him?

552
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:34,368
You big jessie.

553
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,807
On your bikes,
you big numpties.

554
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:16,067
That was Ian's girl
you was trying to talk to, huh?

555
00:42:18,581 --> 00:42:20,242
You dog.

556
00:42:21,984 --> 00:42:24,748
Ian's right. I'm a loser.

557
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,512
- No, you're not a loser.
- Yes, I am.

558
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:28,418
- No, you're not.
- Yes.

559
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:32,186
Trust me. You know the day I met you,
Ian kicked me out of the herd.

560
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:36,195
I lost my antler, I got run over
and tied to the hood of a truck.

561
00:42:36,365 --> 00:42:37,696
What do you call that?

562
00:42:38,968 --> 00:42:41,766
A loser. But check this out.

563
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:44,462
Behold, the mighty grizzly.

564
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,972
I look like a bear, I talk like a bear.

565
00:42:47,143 --> 00:42:50,772
But I can't fish, I can't climb a tree,
I can't even go in the woods.

566
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:54,541
That's nothing. Half doe.
Half buck. I'm a duck.

567
00:42:54,717 --> 00:42:56,412
Hey, I ride a unicycle for crackers!

568
00:42:56,585 --> 00:42:58,712
- I have a glass eye.
- I can't snap.

569
00:42:58,888 --> 00:43:01,823
- I thought "log" was a color.
- I can't see my feet.

570
00:43:01,991 --> 00:43:04,391
I killed a man.

571
00:43:14,503 --> 00:43:16,027
Well, at least you've got a home.

572
00:43:17,073 --> 00:43:18,938
Home. Yeah.

573
00:43:19,108 --> 00:43:21,201
I sure hope so.

574
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:26,012
- Crimenently! Was that your neck?
- No.

575
00:43:28,517 --> 00:43:31,315
My fishy crackers.
Oh, she still loves me.

576
00:43:31,487 --> 00:43:33,114
Thank you, Beth.

577
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:35,223
I'm coming home.

578
00:43:37,259 --> 00:43:39,318
Try one, partner. Yeah.

579
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:42,328
Woo Hoo bars they ain't,
but they take you back.

580
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:44,193
You know? Remind you of home.

581
00:43:44,366 --> 00:43:47,028
Sweet, salty home.

582
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:55,074
Oh, yeah. To be back
in my own soft bed.

583
00:43:55,878 --> 00:44:00,144
Eight square meals a day,
plus snacks.

584
00:44:00,316 --> 00:44:02,216
Beth tucking me in every night.

585
00:44:02,685 --> 00:44:05,085
It's like heaven to me.

586
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:12,189
You know,
when we get back home tomorrow...

587
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:15,057
...I'm gonna make things right
with Beth.

588
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,962
And maybe, just maybe...

589
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:23,271
...we'll find a place
for you in the garage with me.

590
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:26,431
Sweet! Oh, yeah. I'm in the garage.

591
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:28,668
Who's staying in the garage?
I'm in the garage.

592
00:44:28,844 --> 00:44:31,677
Who's got a place in the garage?
It's me. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah--

593
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:33,576
- Hey, buddy?
- Yeah?

594
00:44:33,749 --> 00:44:38,812
Do me a favor, will you?
It's gonna sound silly, but will you--?

595
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:40,421
- Ah, forget it.
- What?

596
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:42,216
Come on. I'm here for you.

597
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:46,487
Will you sing me
that "teddy-bear picnic" song?

598
00:44:46,662 --> 00:44:49,790
Absolutely. The what song?

599
00:44:49,965 --> 00:44:53,264
Well, Beth always sings it to me,
you know, because it helps me sleep.

600
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:57,428
- Okay. I'll give it a shot.
- Thanks.

601
00:44:59,275 --> 00:45:03,075
<i>Once there was a magical elf</i>
<i>Who lived in a rainbow tree</i>

602
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:05,770
<i>He lived downstairs</i>
<i>From a flatulent dwarf</i>

603
00:45:05,948 --> 00:45:07,848
<i>Who was constantly having to pee</i>

604
00:45:08,017 --> 00:45:10,508
<i>One day the elf could take no more</i>

605
00:45:10,686 --> 00:45:13,177
<i>So he went and banged</i>
<i>On the rude dwarf's door</i>

606
00:45:13,355 --> 00:45:18,952
<i>And what do you know</i>
<i>They suddenly both were married</i>

607
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:25,597
Good night, Boog.

608
00:45:26,535 --> 00:45:32,633
I'm sleeping in the garage.
I'm sleeping in the garage.

609
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:40,545
Come on, Mr. Weenie.
Beg. You can do it.

610
00:45:40,716 --> 00:45:42,843
Come on. Beg.

611
00:45:43,018 --> 00:45:46,317
Bob, he won't listen.
Bob, show him how to beg.

612
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:00,868
Dog worship.

613
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:03,232
Oh, my!

614
00:46:03,405 --> 00:46:06,238
- You folks all right?
- What? No, no, no! He's--

615
00:46:06,408 --> 00:46:07,932
Taken you hostage. I know, I know.

616
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,271
You're safe now.
I've got the enemy neutral--

617
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:15,640
There, there, Mr. Weenie.
Are you all right, baby?

618
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:19,447
You're the sweetest
little weenie I ever saw.

619
00:46:20,456 --> 00:46:23,755
Don't be fooled. He's one of them.

620
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:27,860
- Who?
- The enemy! The bear! That deer!

621
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,429
All them animals!

622
00:46:29,798 --> 00:46:32,699
I have seen the future.

623
00:46:32,868 --> 00:46:37,100
It will start in small towns
like Timberline.

624
00:46:38,274 --> 00:46:40,504
<i>Soon, it'll spread.</i>

625
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:47,410
<i>They will invade from burrows,</i>
<i>caves, petting zoos.</i>

626
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:51,509
If I don't stop them...

627
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:56,147
...it'll be a total reversal
of the natural order.

628
00:46:56,325 --> 00:47:01,262
They laugh at old Shaw,
but you'll see.

629
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:04,866
The truth will be revealed.

630
00:47:05,034 --> 00:47:08,265
We know exactly what you mean.

631
00:47:08,437 --> 00:47:11,406
- You do?
- We're scientists. Well, of sorts.

632
00:47:11,573 --> 00:47:14,440
And we're trying to secure
photographic documentation...

633
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,977
...of a real, live homo-sasquatchus.

634
00:47:18,147 --> 00:47:21,241
- Homo-say-what?
- We're looking for Bigfoot.

635
00:47:22,017 --> 00:47:27,614
Bigfoot--? I didn't realize
I was talking to a couple of wack jobs.

636
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:33,450
Don't trust him.
Pets are double agents.

637
00:47:33,629 --> 00:47:37,463
The moment you turn your back,
he'll shiv you!

638
00:47:38,534 --> 00:47:42,903
Oh, no, he can't. We had him fixed.

639
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,569
Boog?

640
00:47:48,143 --> 00:47:50,941
Boog. Are you awake?

641
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:53,745
- I am now.
- Awesome.

642
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:58,376
I was watching you sleep last night
and you were like a little angel.

643
00:47:58,554 --> 00:48:01,580
Except for you're fat
and snoring like:

644
00:48:05,861 --> 00:48:07,351
We're gonna work on that, though.

645
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:10,089
I invented this cure
where you stick your whole hand...

646
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:12,790
- ...in your mouth.
- How long before we get to Timberline?

647
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:16,131
Oh, by nightfall. Easy.

648
00:48:16,305 --> 00:48:17,670
Are you sure?

649
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,740
Absolutely.

650
00:48:19,908 --> 00:48:22,570
Hey, you wanna see
something stupid?

651
00:48:25,047 --> 00:48:27,447
Well, then we better get going.

652
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:30,949
Right. We're on a tight schedule.
I'll carry your load.

653
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,815
Oh, no. Whoa, wait.

654
00:48:32,988 --> 00:48:36,549
Look, you gotta be real careful with
him, okay, because he's real delicate.

655
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:41,755
Want a fishy cracker?

656
00:48:43,532 --> 00:48:47,093
No. I'll eat when I get home.

657
00:48:48,704 --> 00:48:49,728
Listen, girlfriend.

658
00:48:49,905 --> 00:48:52,772
You wanna find a man like my Ignacio,
you gotta check your look.

659
00:48:52,941 --> 00:48:55,739
What are you saying? I'm black
and white. I go with everything.

660
00:48:55,911 --> 00:48:58,311
You go fine with everybody.
Maybe that's your problem.

661
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,506
- Ain't those the same two skunks--
- I had some thoughts on the show.

662
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:03,742
- My show?
- The lady in the shorts has gotta go.

663
00:49:03,919 --> 00:49:07,446
She's slowing us down. It's gotta
be fresh, new. I want some jazz.

664
00:49:07,623 --> 00:49:10,786
I'm the star, and the people out there
come to see me...

665
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:12,324
...a grizzly bear.

666
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:16,328
I see.

667
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:20,525
You get to have the career while
I stay home and look after Dinkleman!

668
00:49:20,702 --> 00:49:22,795
He's not even mine!

669
00:49:23,238 --> 00:49:26,435
I don't get to have a dream.
Is that it?

670
00:49:28,477 --> 00:49:30,672
Buddy.

671
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,378
Don't you think
I might like a little singing...

672
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:38,179
- ...a little dancing, a little:
- Elliot.

673
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:42,483
But no. All I ever hear is, "How long
until we get to Timberline, simple?

674
00:49:42,658 --> 00:49:45,593
- How long until we get home?"
- Elliot! Are those the same beavers?

675
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:50,664
- No. All beavers look alike.
- Hey! Tiny dancer!

676
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:53,063
Yeah, that's right! Shake it, shake it!

677
00:49:53,936 --> 00:49:56,200
- Let's see some moves!
- Elliot!

678
00:49:56,371 --> 00:49:57,463
Yeah.

679
00:49:57,639 --> 00:50:01,939
Elliot, this is the same dang dam.
We've been going in circles!

680
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,012
Circle. One time around.

681
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,876
You don't even know
where we're going.

682
00:50:10,152 --> 00:50:12,347
Got them, Lorraine!

683
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,556
- What was that?
- Hunters?

684
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:27,191
- What are they doing up here?
- Okay, boys. Take cover!

685
00:50:30,139 --> 00:50:32,505
- Boog, we gotta hide.
- I'm out of here.

686
00:50:32,674 --> 00:50:35,302
Boog, wait! Don't go out there!

687
00:50:35,477 --> 00:50:39,641
Hey, tubby, stop! Hey,
this ain't a load-bearing structure!

688
00:50:46,355 --> 00:50:48,016
Oh, that's bad.

689
00:50:51,994 --> 00:50:53,359
Rosie, in here.

690
00:51:09,178 --> 00:51:12,705
- Stop. Get off.
- Buddy, buddy, buddy!

691
00:51:12,881 --> 00:51:14,610
Crud.

692
00:51:28,363 --> 00:51:29,660
Shaw!

693
00:51:32,701 --> 00:51:35,727
Dinkleman!

694
00:51:39,508 --> 00:51:41,169
You're gonna be okay!

695
00:51:41,343 --> 00:51:44,335
We're gonna die and you know it.

696
00:51:49,084 --> 00:51:51,985
No one around here
to save you this time, boys!

697
00:51:52,754 --> 00:51:54,984
Paddle, Boog! Paddle!

698
00:51:57,859 --> 00:52:00,555
Grab a boulder! Grab a boulder!

699
00:52:00,729 --> 00:52:03,459
Left, left. Right!

700
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:05,489
Oh, like you know.

701
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,002
Where is he?

702
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:15,939
He's gone. Oh, there he is.

703
00:52:16,111 --> 00:52:19,205
No, wait. There he is. There he is.

704
00:52:19,648 --> 00:52:21,115
- Why, you little--
- There he is.

705
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:22,773
Quiet, I'm trying to drive.

706
00:52:28,824 --> 00:52:30,553
Faster, Boog!

707
00:52:31,727 --> 00:52:34,696
Like fishing and hunting
at the same time.

708
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:52,444
- Give me a hand, Boog! Hold me!
- Stop. Get off! Elliot, get off. Get off!

709
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,371
Stop!

710
00:53:36,692 --> 00:53:38,626
Dinkleman?

711
00:53:56,044 --> 00:53:59,138
You. You did this.

712
00:53:59,314 --> 00:54:00,975
- Yeah, that's right.
- What did I do?

713
00:54:01,149 --> 00:54:03,083
You dragged us down
to the hunting grounds.

714
00:54:03,251 --> 00:54:06,448
- Yeah, where are we gonna hide?
- We're sitting ducks out here.

715
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:08,054
And it's open season!

716
00:54:08,223 --> 00:54:11,124
All right, all right. That's enough.

717
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:12,954
Guys, it's not his fault.

718
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:15,221
Oh, you're right, Elliot. It's your fault.

719
00:54:15,564 --> 00:54:16,792
- My fault?
- Yeah.

720
00:54:17,232 --> 00:54:19,359
If it weren't for you
I'd be home right now.

721
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:21,092
None of this
would've ever happened.

722
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:24,067
You said you knew the way back,
but you lied.

723
00:54:24,573 --> 00:54:27,838
I-- No.

724
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:29,609
Okay.

725
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:31,678
Okay, maybe--

726
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:34,945
I thought if you hung out with me
then maybe you would like me.

727
00:54:35,117 --> 00:54:38,518
Oh, man. I trusted you, Elliot.

728
00:54:38,687 --> 00:54:40,746
I'm sorry, Boog.

729
00:54:41,189 --> 00:54:43,214
We're still partners, right?

730
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:46,156
You know, Elliot, I'm better off alone.

731
00:54:47,863 --> 00:54:49,296
What about us?

732
00:54:49,464 --> 00:54:51,432
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what about us?

733
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,761
Us? There's no us.

734
00:54:53,935 --> 00:54:57,336
You're not my problem.
And you? We're done.

735
00:54:57,506 --> 00:55:00,600
- But-- Boog, wait.
- Done.

736
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:31,030
- Oh, no.
- Thanks for the license, Gordy.

737
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:32,962
All right, guys. Good luck.

738
00:56:33,134 --> 00:56:37,400
- Hey, Earl. That a new truck?
- Yeah. Check it out. Jealous much?

739
00:56:39,007 --> 00:56:40,372
You okay?

740
00:56:40,542 --> 00:56:42,942
I put him way above the falls.

741
00:56:43,812 --> 00:56:45,473
I hope I did the right thing.

742
00:56:45,647 --> 00:56:50,175
Don't worry, Beth. I'm sure Boog
is happy in his new home.

743
00:56:52,754 --> 00:56:54,551
Stupid nature.

744
00:56:57,058 --> 00:56:58,650
Civilization.

745
00:57:04,032 --> 00:57:05,693
Hello?

746
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:09,462
Excuse me. Is anybody home?

747
00:57:16,378 --> 00:57:18,869
Oh, sweet porcelain.

748
00:57:27,923 --> 00:57:31,086
And the crowd goes wild!

749
00:57:34,062 --> 00:57:36,860
Now, there's gotta be
a fridge in here somewhere.

750
00:58:31,353 --> 00:58:32,581
Oh, no.

751
00:58:32,754 --> 00:58:37,088
Deers, skunks, beavers.

752
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:40,058
I gotta hide.

753
00:58:42,597 --> 00:58:45,327
That bear's turned them all.

754
00:58:56,678 --> 00:59:01,274
Here you go, Lorraine.
There, you get good and dry.

755
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:05,351
Come morning,
we got a rebellion to crush.

756
00:59:05,854 --> 00:59:09,346
And then I'm gonna
take back what's mine!

757
00:59:09,524 --> 00:59:11,515
Elliot.

758
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:20,064
Someone's been eating my candy.

759
00:59:26,207 --> 00:59:28,505
Somebody's been sitting in my chair.

760
00:59:34,983 --> 00:59:37,383
Somebody forgot to flush!

761
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:45,087
And he's still here.

762
00:59:46,194 --> 00:59:50,460
Come back for your bear,
Goldilocks?

763
00:59:56,137 --> 01:00:02,042
Ready or not, here I come!

764
01:00:07,716 --> 01:00:14,485
<i>If you go out in the woods today</i>
<i>You're sure of a big surprise</i>

765
01:00:15,757 --> 01:00:23,220
<i>If you go out in the woods today</i>
<i>You better go in disguise</i>

766
01:00:23,565 --> 01:00:27,160
<i>'Cause every bear</i>
<i>That ever there was</i>

767
01:00:28,236 --> 01:00:33,071
<i>Was gathered there</i>
<i>Together because</i>

768
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:37,673
<i>Today's the day</i>
<i>The teddy bears have</i>

769
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:42,510
<i>Their picnic!</i>

770
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:15,043
Hey, bear! There ain't nowhere
that you can hide from me!

771
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:25,188
As soon as I get mine:

772
01:01:26,127 --> 01:01:27,355
Blowing their heads off!

773
01:01:27,529 --> 01:01:28,928
Good time.

774
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:53,311
Elliot.

775
01:02:04,532 --> 01:02:06,932
No buddy.

776
01:02:21,983 --> 01:02:23,712
Elliot, you've gotta hide.

777
01:02:25,386 --> 01:02:27,445
The hunters are here.

778
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:40,191
He's gonna give us away.

779
01:02:42,937 --> 01:02:45,929
All right! Bring it! Bring it!

780
01:02:46,374 --> 01:02:48,035
- Boog?
- Hey, buddy.

781
01:02:48,209 --> 01:02:49,642
What are you doing back here?

782
01:02:49,811 --> 01:02:51,870
Come on. I couldn't go home
without my partner.

783
01:02:52,046 --> 01:02:54,037
- I don't have a partner.
- Elliot.

784
01:02:54,215 --> 01:02:57,343
I don't need the herd
and I don't need you.

785
01:02:57,518 --> 01:02:59,008
So leave me alone.

786
01:03:00,388 --> 01:03:02,049
Ain't gonna be able to do it.

787
01:03:02,223 --> 01:03:04,248
You see, I already saved you once.

788
01:03:04,425 --> 01:03:08,452
That makes me responsible for you.

789
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:12,225
I saw that. Come on.
Let me hear you say it. Partners.

790
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,493
- No.
- What was that?

791
01:03:15,136 --> 01:03:17,604
- I guess we can be partners.
- Sorry, I can't hear you.

792
01:03:17,772 --> 01:03:19,740
I said I guess we can be partners.

793
01:03:21,376 --> 01:03:24,038
- Partners!
- Partners!

794
01:03:24,512 --> 01:03:26,707
Okey-dokey. This way.

795
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:30,009
- This way.
- Right. Maybe you better lead.

796
01:03:30,184 --> 01:03:33,881
Yeah. Let's get back to the garage,
where it's safe.

797
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:36,353
- Safe?
- Safe?

798
01:03:39,227 --> 01:03:43,186
Hey, Boog. How many animals
can fit in the garage?

799
01:03:43,364 --> 01:03:44,422
How many--?

800
01:03:44,866 --> 01:03:46,857
Hello, Boog.

801
01:03:47,936 --> 01:03:50,803
So where you all headed?

802
01:03:50,972 --> 01:03:54,738
- To the safe place.
- This land of garage.

803
01:03:54,909 --> 01:03:57,776
- With buddy.
- Come on. You owe us, Tiny.

804
01:03:57,946 --> 01:03:59,413
- Yeah!
- Yeah! That's right!

805
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:02,947
Yeah, I'm sorry about the dam.

806
01:04:03,117 --> 01:04:08,111
And how I messed you all up,
you know. My bad.

807
01:04:08,289 --> 01:04:11,884
So you're taking us with you,
right, Booger?

808
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,858
Please? Please.

809
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:19,728
Look at me. I'm too pretty to die!

810
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:22,468
Well, maybe...

811
01:04:24,672 --> 01:04:26,230
No! No! No!

812
01:04:26,407 --> 01:04:28,238
You ain't leaving without us.

813
01:04:28,409 --> 01:04:30,036
I didn't mean to call you Booger.

814
01:04:30,211 --> 01:04:33,908
- Can we take Giselle?
- Wait! Let me think.

815
01:04:35,283 --> 01:04:36,773
Hunters.

816
01:04:37,418 --> 01:04:41,081
Dang. Nobody's going home tonight.

817
01:04:41,255 --> 01:04:42,882
There's so many of them.

818
01:04:43,057 --> 01:04:45,184
That's it, then.

819
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,624
No more me.

820
01:04:50,698 --> 01:04:52,996
I guess I will be mounted on a wall.

821
01:04:56,938 --> 01:04:59,202
Oh, no, you won't.

822
01:04:59,374 --> 01:05:01,865
Now, when I'm a bearskin rug,
they can walk all over me.

823
01:05:02,043 --> 01:05:05,137
But until that happens,
I ain't going out without a fight.

824
01:05:05,413 --> 01:05:06,641
- What?
- Fight?

825
01:05:06,814 --> 01:05:08,975
- The F word?
- That's right.

826
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,777
One thing you all have taught me...

827
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:14,484
...the woods is a messed-up,
dangerous place.

828
01:05:15,656 --> 01:05:20,025
And y'all are crazy. You've been
kicking my butt for the last two days.

829
01:05:20,595 --> 01:05:21,584
Yeah, I kind of did.

830
01:05:21,763 --> 01:05:22,991
- I didn't.
- Sorry.

831
01:05:23,164 --> 01:05:25,496
So let's do to them
what you've been doing to me.

832
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:29,158
Now, I say we give our guests
the full outdoor experience.

833
01:05:29,337 --> 01:05:31,066
Yeah!

834
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:34,834
Hey! Is this a private fight
or can anybody join?

835
01:05:35,009 --> 01:05:37,204
Because McSquizzy wants in.

836
01:05:38,212 --> 01:05:40,146
Good. Because we'll need your nuts.

837
01:05:40,314 --> 01:05:42,908
- And your acorns too.
- What's the plan, Boog?

838
01:05:43,084 --> 01:05:45,348
Oh, we gonna run
those yahoos back to town.

839
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:50,014
Yeah, baby. When we get through
with them, they won't ever come back.

840
01:05:54,262 --> 01:05:57,561
So you think you're so tough, huh?

841
01:05:59,967 --> 01:06:01,992
Well, you know what I think?

842
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,936
I think you're still
just a mama's bear.

843
01:06:14,315 --> 01:06:17,375
You guard the fort, Mr. Weenie.
Mama's gonna take a dip.

844
01:06:18,953 --> 01:06:22,184
That's good.
Mama's getting kind of gamey.

845
01:06:22,356 --> 01:06:26,156
Come on, Bob. There's gonna be
a full moon out tonight.

846
01:06:33,134 --> 01:06:35,728
- Sorry.
- Come on. Let's go.

847
01:06:44,645 --> 01:06:45,873
Boog?

848
01:06:49,383 --> 01:06:51,180
Oh, yeah.

849
01:06:52,653 --> 01:06:56,020
- Maria, let go.
- I'll carry it.

850
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:57,953
It's empty.

851
01:06:58,126 --> 01:06:59,388
Ladies.

852
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,393
Heave-ho, heave-ho.

853
01:07:06,033 --> 01:07:08,058
This is gonna be great.

854
01:07:11,139 --> 01:07:13,471
You. We gonna need more ducks.

855
01:07:13,641 --> 01:07:16,132
Elliot, is that chocolate on your face?

856
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:17,937
No.

857
01:07:19,814 --> 01:07:21,839
- It's a pet.
- He's gonna blow our cover.

858
01:07:25,853 --> 01:07:29,050
I've been living a lie!

859
01:07:29,757 --> 01:07:32,749
Please, take me with you.

860
01:07:58,786 --> 01:08:02,119
Hey, Boog. You're not still mad
about that backpack thing, are you?

861
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:06,590
Oh, no. I never hold a grudge.
I just let them go.

862
01:08:07,695 --> 01:08:08,684
What was that?

863
01:08:11,899 --> 01:08:13,594
It's the signal.

864
01:08:17,538 --> 01:08:20,735
Okay, Deni. Let's round them up!

865
01:08:20,908 --> 01:08:23,775
All right, ladies. Let her rip!

866
01:08:34,555 --> 01:08:36,614
- Gas mask.
- Got it!

867
01:08:42,263 --> 01:08:43,491
My pants!

868
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:46,833
Good job, Reilly. All right.

869
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:49,663
Time to run
these guys back to town.

870
01:08:50,638 --> 01:08:51,900
Are you ready for this?

871
01:08:52,073 --> 01:08:56,772
- This is awkward.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

872
01:08:59,447 --> 01:09:01,881
- Can I?
- Go for it, Smelliot.

873
01:09:02,049 --> 01:09:04,210
Charge!

874
01:09:06,287 --> 01:09:09,552
Holy stampede! It's a stampede!

875
01:09:10,057 --> 01:09:12,389
All right. Show me your "grr" face!

876
01:09:15,062 --> 01:09:16,723
Now, let's kick
some hunter bahookie!

877
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:20,664
Bob, we've been robbed!

878
01:09:20,835 --> 01:09:22,894
And they took Mr. Weenie!

879
01:09:23,738 --> 01:09:26,673
Come on, mate!
Move them pudgy wee legs!

880
01:09:26,841 --> 01:09:29,537
I feel so alive!

881
01:09:29,977 --> 01:09:32,309
Drop antlers!

882
01:09:42,156 --> 01:09:43,384
Bless me.

883
01:09:47,895 --> 01:09:50,557
No! No!

884
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,528
How you doing, partner?

885
01:09:53,701 --> 01:09:56,898
Boog, this is great.
Let's do this every year.

886
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:06,943
No, no! Get that bill away from me.

887
01:10:12,753 --> 01:10:14,084
Fire!

888
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:18,317
Guys, let's get out of here!

889
01:10:31,906 --> 01:10:33,134
Sheriff! Sheriff!

890
01:10:33,307 --> 01:10:36,674
The animals are going wild,
and the bear is their leader!

891
01:10:37,845 --> 01:10:39,210
It's for you.

892
01:10:41,182 --> 01:10:42,843
Gordy, I'm bringing him home.

893
01:10:43,017 --> 01:10:45,781
Come on, men!
They're just animals.

894
01:10:47,922 --> 01:10:49,617
Elliot, catch.

895
01:10:51,225 --> 01:10:52,817
Got it.

896
01:10:53,728 --> 01:10:55,855
Present arms!

897
01:10:57,932 --> 01:11:01,095
Yeah!

898
01:11:03,304 --> 01:11:04,794
Fire!

899
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:07,672
Oh, my God!

900
01:11:09,076 --> 01:11:10,304
Back to the trucks!

901
01:11:10,478 --> 01:11:12,446
Boog, it's working.

902
01:11:12,613 --> 01:11:14,205
Yeah. Look at them run.

903
01:11:14,382 --> 01:11:16,850
- Send in Mr. Happy!
- Who?

904
01:11:18,285 --> 01:11:19,752
Go, go, go!

905
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:24,386
Adieu!

906
01:11:28,963 --> 01:11:30,726
Mr. Happy didn't go off.

907
01:11:30,898 --> 01:11:33,526
Hey, whoa. We're just supposed
to run them into town.

908
01:11:33,701 --> 01:11:38,502
Well, it's time for them
to start running, isn't it?

909
01:11:44,912 --> 01:11:47,779
Hey, Earl, ain't that your truck?

910
01:11:49,583 --> 01:11:51,210
That's a bummer.

911
01:12:02,329 --> 01:12:05,059
That's right. Keep running.

912
01:12:07,067 --> 01:12:08,398
Sweet.

913
01:12:08,569 --> 01:12:10,537
Freedom!

914
01:12:25,553 --> 01:12:29,011
Hello, Goldilocks.

915
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:30,452
What?

916
01:12:32,493 --> 01:12:34,120
Bull's-eye!

917
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:41,026
Quick! We need more ammo.

918
01:12:44,805 --> 01:12:47,501
Elliot! Elliot, stop helping me.

919
01:12:47,675 --> 01:12:51,042
- Keep it coming.
- Okay. Let's see how you like it.

920
01:12:51,779 --> 01:12:53,508
A pillow? Oh, come on!

921
01:12:53,681 --> 01:12:55,615
More! More!

922
01:12:59,653 --> 01:13:01,086
All right.

923
01:13:01,255 --> 01:13:03,086
Come on, mama's bear.

924
01:13:03,257 --> 01:13:06,317
You can do better than that.
Let's see what you got.

925
01:13:07,628 --> 01:13:08,925
Come on.

926
01:13:10,531 --> 01:13:12,260
Boog!

927
01:13:18,105 --> 01:13:21,871
Oh, yeah. Don't mess
with the Boogster. Fore!

928
01:13:23,677 --> 01:13:25,508
All right, Lorraine.

929
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,477
Let's kiss this bear good night.

930
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,571
No! No! Stop!

931
01:14:03,017 --> 01:14:04,484
Elliot?

932
01:14:09,723 --> 01:14:11,156
Buddy?

933
01:14:16,363 --> 01:14:18,661
Oh, Elliot.

934
01:14:23,037 --> 01:14:25,096
You all right, Elliot?

935
01:14:26,607 --> 01:14:29,235
I'm a little lightheaded.

936
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:35,778
Hey, Tiny. Nice show.

937
01:14:36,417 --> 01:14:39,284
- Behold, the mighty grizzly.
- Boog, Boog, Boog.

938
01:14:43,357 --> 01:14:44,722
- Let's get him!
- What? No!

939
01:14:46,026 --> 01:14:48,426
- Stay away! No!
- Here you go.

940
01:14:48,596 --> 01:14:50,996
Cannonball!

941
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:54,767
You know, Elliot,
this place ain't so bad.

942
01:14:54,935 --> 01:14:56,527
Hold that thought. Oh, yeah.

943
01:14:56,704 --> 01:14:59,070
Karate noises!

944
01:15:12,252 --> 01:15:13,241
No.

945
01:15:18,192 --> 01:15:21,252
- Beth?
- Boog?

946
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,568
Oh, Boog.

947
01:15:34,742 --> 01:15:36,835
- What's he doing?
- Is he not gonna maul her?

948
01:15:37,011 --> 01:15:40,742
No. She's his mom.
She's taking us home.

949
01:15:40,914 --> 01:15:42,609
Every buddy?

950
01:15:42,783 --> 01:15:46,879
I was so worried.
I'm bringing you back with me.

951
01:15:47,054 --> 01:15:49,079
Come on. Let's go home.

952
01:16:17,017 --> 01:16:19,349
Oh, no.

953
01:16:23,657 --> 01:16:25,955
Come on, Boog. Let's go home.

954
01:16:34,768 --> 01:16:36,292
Boog?

955
01:16:51,418 --> 01:16:52,976
You are home.

956
01:16:58,559 --> 01:17:00,789
I'm so proud of you.

957
01:17:02,529 --> 01:17:06,693
So how are we both
gonna fit in the helicopter?

958
01:17:06,867 --> 01:17:08,391
- She's coming back, right?
- Who?

959
01:17:08,569 --> 01:17:10,434
The shorts lady. Boog?

960
01:17:10,804 --> 01:17:12,635
- Hey, big guy.
- What's up, Tiny?

961
01:17:12,806 --> 01:17:14,137
- What's up?
- You said that we--

962
01:17:14,308 --> 01:17:15,935
- You're judging me?
- How y'all doing?

963
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:17,270
- Hey, Boog.
- Hi, Boog.

964
01:17:17,444 --> 01:17:19,878
I know he's a duck.
But he treats me like a lady.

965
01:17:20,047 --> 01:17:21,275
- But she's--
- Hey, buddy.

966
01:17:21,448 --> 01:17:24,212
- Hey, find me some food.
- Come on. What is our pickup time?

967
01:17:24,384 --> 01:17:27,649
Elliot, we're staying here.
This is our home.

968
01:17:27,821 --> 01:17:30,984
These are our people.
This is where we reside.

969
01:17:31,158 --> 01:17:32,921
What? Are you insane?

970
01:17:33,093 --> 01:17:35,061
Where have you been
for the last two days?

971
01:17:35,229 --> 01:17:38,756
This place is horrible. Horrible!

972
01:17:38,932 --> 01:17:41,696
- Hey, guys.
- What's up, Ian?

973
01:17:44,805 --> 01:17:46,670
Come on, Elliot. It ain't that bad.

974
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,707
She's at least gonna bring
some Woo Hoo bars, right?

975
01:17:49,877 --> 01:17:51,606
It's just the two of us, Elliot.

976
01:17:51,779 --> 01:17:53,679
Unless you plan
on going back to your herd.

977
01:17:53,847 --> 01:17:56,748
What? And break up the team?
Bros before does.

978
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,851
Yeah. Bros before does.

979
01:17:59,019 --> 01:18:01,146
Hello, Elliot.

980
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:03,050
Catch you later, Boog.

981
01:18:09,363 --> 01:18:13,459
Hey! Get off my trees,
you bucktoothed sporran!

982
01:18:15,068 --> 01:18:17,559
Feels like home, baby.

983
01:18:17,738 --> 01:18:19,365
Hey, Boog!

984
01:18:20,274 --> 01:18:23,141
- Rabbit fight!
- Oh, no, you didn't.

985
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:25,904
Oh, yeah? Well, eat rabbit.

986
01:18:26,747 --> 01:18:28,146
Hey, buddy.

987
01:18:54,074 --> 01:18:55,302
Bob! Bob!

988
01:19:02,382 --> 01:19:06,478
A real live homo-sasquatchus.

989
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:14,024
Wait, wait. No. No. No!
