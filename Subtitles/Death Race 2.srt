2
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,443
Hey, are you gooks almost done?

3
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,867
Faggot.

4
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,172
-You are big motherfucker, yes?
-Yeah.

5
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:30,200
Just moments ago, a full-scale riot broke out
at Terminal Island Penitentiary.

6
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,032
As far as I can tell,
there has been no action taken

7
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,205
by Terminal Island Prison
correction officers.

8
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,032
Lock down the bridge,
keep the tower guards.

9
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,538
I want everyone else down here now.

10
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,045
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

11
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,308
Of course I'm serious!
Patch me live right fucking now!

12
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,895
Either you take me live
or I tell your wife everything.

13
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,401
You got that, right?

14
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,114
What a shit match.

15
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,910
I would never have bet
if I knew Spiro was injured.

16
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,171
-But you did, huh?
-Yeah. Take your winnings.

17
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,759
The whole world's falling apart,
and Manchester United with it.

18
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,547
When I came over here,

19
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,100
that clip was the first thing I ever bought
with my own money, you know?

20
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,056
So, you take care of it. You look after it.

21
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,360
Look at you, profiting off football.
He's never watched a match in his life.

22
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,028
That's 'cause it's fucking boring, that's why.

23
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,571
The world's greatest game.

24
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,489
I think it's the third
world's greatest game, right?

25
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,112
What the fuck are you laughing at?

26
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,573
Excuse us, please.

27
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,879
About the bank,

28
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,591
its important to me.

29
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,086
I know it is.

30
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,680
That's why I want to handle it my way,
with my guys.

31
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,634
Well, Vinnie brought me this score.

32
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,225
My stipulation is that you're in charge,
which is the way I want it.

33
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,603
-Can I count on you?
-What do you think?

34
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,523
Yeah.

35
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,567
I know Vinnie and his boys are a bit green,

36
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,072
but what my nephew lacks in experience,
he makes up for with enthusiasm.

37
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,367
Exactly what I'm worried about.

38
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,414
Look, he fucks up, Mr. Kane,
he answers to me, okay?

39
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,335
Lt's going to be all right, Luke. Trust me.

40
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,627
Always do.

41
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,791
I know you do.

42
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,960
Come on. I've got something to show you.

43
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,271
What do you think?

44
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,394
This is for me?

45
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,893
-You don't like it?
-I think it's beautiful.

46
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,025
I just think, maybe, you know,
based on the kind of work I do,

47
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,607
you don't think its a bit orange?

48
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,364
-You don't fucking like it.
-Are you kidding me?

49
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,785
She's stunning.

50
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,908
I just wonder, you think I might
stand out in this thing?

51
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,540
No, the more obvious you are,
the less suspicious you appear.

52
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,875
So, like, hiding in plain sight kind of thing.

53
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,627
Precisely.

54
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,592
Okay.

55
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,176
Don't fuck it up.

56
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,849
Thank you both for coming.

57
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,270
Mr. Weyland, I'm not exactly sure
why she's here,

58
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,853
but I know why I am, sir. I've failed you
and I've disgraced the corporation.

59
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,362
Relax.

60
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,192
I'm surprised those animals
don't kill each other with more regularity.

61
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,368
You're both here
because this incident has created

62
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,116
a public relations nightmare for me.

63
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,374
Was something I said funny?

64
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,128
Well, you had a 48 share.

65
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,508
Your network's previous high was a seven.

66
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,512
What you call a nightmare
I'd call a wet dream.

67
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:49,721
Mr. Weyland, I know that the network
isn't your prime moneymaker.

68
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,812
But I can't believe that you don't realise
what a gold mine you're sitting on.

69
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,693
Humour me, Miss Jones.

70
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,064
People are tired of fake violence

71
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,825
and fights staged by Vegas promoters.

72
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,657
The hatred that your inmates have

73
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,074
is pure. Can't be duplicated.

74
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,665
You're calling what happened today
entertainment?

75
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,996
Ah!

76
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,880
What exactly do you have in mind?

77
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,756
No, seriously, I gotta tell you,

78
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,343
this motherfuckers never carried a gun
in 20 years working for my uncle.

79
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,349
-- That right, Luke?
- Vinnie, pay attention.

80
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,931
You got 60 seconds. You get in, you get out.

81
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,057
-No one gets hurt.
-We know. Don't worry.

82
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,391
We got company. Get out of there.

83
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,639
Vinnie, you copy?

84
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,141
Don't worry about it, man.
Don? stress 0ut.

85
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,186
-Look, abort. Get out of there.
-Chill, man.

86
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,856
Jonesy, abort. Abort. Get out of there.

87
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,603
-It's under control.
-Fuck.

88
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,036
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down! Don't look at me!

89
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,707
Freeze!

90
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,501
-Freeze!
-What the fuck?

91
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,461
Hey!

92
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:51,974
Fucking idiot!

93
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,855
Twenty years and nobody got hurt.

94
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,723
You. Dumb fuck.

95
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,350
We're leaving now! Move!

96
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,395
-Shit!
-Fuck!

97
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,064
-Shit! God damn it!
-Go, go, go, man!

98
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,736
Come on, let's move!

99
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,738
Fuck this, then.

100
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,332
What are you looking at? Stop!

101
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,205
You're crazy!

102
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,416
-- Move!
- Freeze!

103
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,628
Let's get the fuck out of here!

104
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,902
Go. Go, go, go, go!

105
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,775
-Get in the fucking car, Vinnie.
-Right.

106
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,273
-Move!
-Gotta go!

107
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,833
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

108
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,952
You're going to get us fucking killed,
like Terry.

109
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,796
The only motherfucker that got Terry killed
was you. Fucking relax!

110
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,846
We're gonna blast our way through.

111
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,764
No one's getting blasted,
you fucking understand me?

112
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,474
They're gaining on us.
Luke, fuck, I ain't getting pinched.

113
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,430
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

114
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,341
What the fuck was that for?

115
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,298
-Fuck you.
-Drop the fucking gun.

116
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,892
-Make a choice.
-Fuck.

117
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,352
Your uncle is family.

118
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,056
It's the only fucking reason
you guys are walking from this. Get out.

119
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:27,975
Get out the fucking car!

120
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,166
Chefs from Season 1
are back for redemption,

121
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,872
...and it appears there's even more...

122
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,083
...bank robbery suspect
is caught red-handed...

123
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,840
Wall that's still
yet to be confirmed I'm afraid, Ron,

124
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,092
as busy King Street
is starting to get back to normal right now.

125
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,768
Just a few hours ago, it was the scene
of high tension as gunfire rang...

126
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,415
Of the four suspects,
one has been identified

127
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,585
as Carl Lucas, who is a known associate

128
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,787
-of alleged crime boss Markus Kane.
-Fuck!

129
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,258
-We will now take you live downtown...
-Fucking hell!

130
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,030
Fuck!

131
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,141
Stay where you are!

132
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,274
Hands up!

133
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,582
Take a last look at the mainland, boys.

134
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,410
You ain't gonna see her again
once we cross this bridge.

135
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,497
Bridges.
Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is the longest,

136
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,544
38-and-a-half kilometres long,

137
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,211
followed by Donghai Bridge,
32-and-a-half kilometres long.

138
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,390
-The King Fahd Causeway comes in third.
-Fucking mumbling, stuttering bastard.

139
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,768
-Could you shut the fuck up'?
-Leave him alone.

140
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,971
Prattling on every 10 minutes.

141
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,023
-I'm getting sick and fucking tired of you.
-He's scared.

142
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,601
What do you care?

143
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,236
I don't.

144
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,243
All right! Let's move!

145
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,288
Get out! Get out!

146
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,543
Move! Come on, move!
Get out here! Get out here!

147
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,253
Get the fuck off me.

148
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,300
Come on, get out. Come on now.

149
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,671
l will not testify Never.

150
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,751
The DA's gonna pull his offer Luke.

151
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,221
Kane'll walk away scat-free,
and you'll go away for life.

152
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,302
You see, I'm not gonna testify
against Markus Kane.

153
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,388
Not for immunity not for money

154
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,816
not for anything.

155
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,740
We have some good news, Mr. Kane.
We found Luke.

156
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,372
-He's on the Island.
-That is good news.

157
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,250
Always knew I could trust that guy.

158
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,913
I told you. No way would he betray me.

159
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,757
Have him taken out.

160
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,097
You're joking, right?

161
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,221
So far, he hasn't played ball with the feds.

162
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,471
He's in for life. What happens
after a month of hard time, eh?

163
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,599
After a couple of them African apes
have a go at him.

164
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,777
How long do you think
he's gonna slay loyal then?

165
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,405
You know, it's a shame,

166
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,117
'cause I love that guy like a brother.

167
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,535
Anything else?

168
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,162
No, sir.

169
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,088
-What else do you wanton this?
-It's perfect.

170
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,257
-Yeah? Here, then.
-Thank you.

171
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,216
Fuck you!

172
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,058
The average Death Match fight
gamers a 50 share.

173
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,816
It peaked two months ago at 62,
but has been on the decline since.

174
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,399
The most dangerous fighter is Big Bill,
with a death count of 19,

175
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,733
followed by 14K,

176
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,952
-who, coincidentally, has 14 kills.
-Great, man.

177
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,571
Someone did their homework, right'?

178
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,573
-Is that him?
-Yeah.

179
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,962
That's September Jones.
Former Miss Universe.

180
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,508
Was stripped of her crown after allegations
of a sexual relationship with all five judges.

181
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,964
Went to work for Weyland Broadcasting
as a weather girl,

182
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,763
is now the host and executive producer
of Death Match,

183
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,465
She grew a...

184
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,432
You have a list pretty much ready to go
on anything, don't you?

185
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:07,938
Live from Terminal Island
televisions most violent most disturbing,

186
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,520
and most watched programme
in human history.

187
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,355
Welcome to Death Match.

188
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:19,196
Our first fighter a murderer serving
four consecutive life sentences,

189
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,289
Xander Grady!

190
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,373
Xander
11 kills, one submission.

191
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,130
6'4" 220 pounds.

192
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,845
His opponent
leader of the Terminal Island Triads,

193
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,468
he currently ranks second on the kill board

194
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,973
he was Interpol's third most wanted
until his arrest in Los Angeles last year:

195
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,887
14K!

196
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:50,481
14K one submission, 14 kills.

197
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:54,151
5'11" 159 pounds.

198
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,860
The combatants are picked by lottery
randomly each week.

199
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,323
There are two ways to win.
Kill your opponent or make him submit.

200
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,249
There are several
pressure plates that, when activated

201
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,337
can give a fighter access
to a variety of weapons.

202
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,540
But they only have 10 seconds
to access them.

203
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,505
If no fighter has won,
both fighters are killed.

204
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,758
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.

205
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,522
You're number one!

206
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,604
You're number one!

207
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,231
Yo, baby, you're my number one!

208
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,359
Chinese bastard!

209
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,638
Something's not right.

210
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,608
What're you talking about?

211
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,110
Die!

212
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:12,168
14K! 14K! 14K! 14K!

213
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,165
You want it? Huh?

214
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,676
Let go, man!

215
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,850
I will never give up!

216
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,025
-He quit!
-No!

217
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,191
Another fucking submission!

218
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,025
He quit!

219
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,913
-- 14K! 14K!
- Tonight's winner

220
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,366
14K!

221
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,999
Death Match is a trademark
of Weyland International.

222
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:04,508
Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts should not be duplicated at home.

223
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,851
Exactly what the fuck
do you think you are doing?

224
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,520
You are done.

225
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,692
Done!

226
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,039
Lights out!

227
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,553
Hey, baby.

228
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,981
The numbers from the overnights are in.

229
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,435
What do I pay you for?

230
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,654
The ratings are down again. This time, 20%.

231
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:09,323
Now, you better reverse the trend,
or I'll End someone who can.

232
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,662
Are you sure?

233
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:19,629
Yes, I'm sure. Now, you make my
motherfucking money. You understand me?

234
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,473
It's a strict Triad code.

235
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:35,804
Whoever spills the blood of a Triad,
they're sworn to take that person's life.

236
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,847
Xander killed a Triad last match.

237
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,353
It defies logic why he wouldn't kill him
if he had the chance.

238
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,610
Hey, kid,
I'm not looking for a best friend, okay?

239
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,187
So, just leave me alone.

240
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,644
Carl Lucas.

241
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,480
-- Chill. Chill, man.
- Relax.

242
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,559
You've been assigned to our work detail.

243
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,859
That's Rocco,

244
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,441
I'm Goldberg.

245
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,398
-Goldberg, huh?
-Yeah.

246
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,075
What are you, like, then.
You, like, the last Mexican Jew, or what?

247
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,405
Yeah. I killed all the rest.

248
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,205
Okay. So, this work detail,
what are we looking at?

249
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,415
And don't tell me we're washing underwear.

250
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,960
-No.
-I don't care what you're into.

251
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,086
I'm not washing anybody's underwear.

252
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,591
On your fest, Lucas. Warden wants you.

253
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,456
That'll be all.

254
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,879
Carl Lucas, arrested 22 times
over a span of 20 years.

255
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,754
But nothing ever stuck,
not a single damn one.

256
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,589
You just slipped through the cracks.

257
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,891
Well, I shot a cop.

258
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,845
Those cracks, they till up pretty fast.

259
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,684
They sure do. Yeah.

260
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,142
Now, at first I didn't realise who you were.

261
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,979
Really? So, who am I'?

262
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,899
Well, an idiot, and soon a dead man.

263
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,573
DA offers you a talk-and-walk,
and you tum him down?

264
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,738
Is that why you gut me here?

265
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,989
No, ifs not. I'm here to warn you.

266
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,743
-Save your breath.
-Oh, don't get smart with me.

267
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,668
I don't know how many others know
who you are,

268
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,166
but when the word gets out,

269
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,623
the killers are gonna be
coming out of the woodwork.

270
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,462
Is that right?

271
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,465
And mark my words,

272
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,549
Markus Kane will not show you the
same type of loyalty that you've shown him.

273
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:36,409
Look, 14K kills Xander,

274
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,615
he makes him a martyr. Thais like an honour.

275
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:43,036
Xander quits,
shames himself and the entire brotherhood.

276
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,164
That makes him like a pussy.

277
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,249
You got him, guys?

278
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,251
Yeah.

279
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,086
Oh, man.

280
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,131
I got a question. All these cars, man,
it's not exactly prison norm.

281
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,302
What's the deal?

282
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,258
Hey, Terminal Island is not
about rehabilitation. You know what I mean?

283
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:04,971
It's a business.
All these cars, we melt them down,

284
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,727
make weapons, guns, shells.

285
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,480
If it kills, we make it.

286
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,231
Hey, are you telling me the governments
paying top dollar for this recycled shit?

287
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,941
Top dollar?
Who said anything about top dollar?

288
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,869
Weyland International sells this stuff
dirt-cheap.

289
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,287
Yeah, when you're not paying for labour,

290
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,581
your prices can afford to be a little lower,
you know what I mean?

291
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,163
They're making
money off our blood.

292
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,750
-What do you know about these wheels?
-A little bit.

293
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,758
-How does she run?
-Why don't you see what she's got?

294
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,758
-For real??
-For real.

295
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,931
Why not?

296
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,133
Someone's been
driving a getaway car!

297
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,754
God damn,
you put some magic in this thing.

298
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,015
-How does she handle?
-Just the way she's supposed to.

299
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,637
Who was driving that car?

300
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:08,928
-What car?
-What car?

301
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,398
Hey, Luke, you a fighter?

302
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,650
I got no reason to fight anyone.

303
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,870
Hey, reasons don't mean shit in this place.

304
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,531
The Calendar's always looking
for new blood,

305
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,582
and you look like just her type.

306
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,285
Good to know.

307
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:46,765
Some advice, blend in.
Don't give her no reason to fixate on you.

308
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,801
Hey, Goldberg, I'm the last guy
looking for a fucking spotlight.

309
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,185
-Hey!
-Hey!

310
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,354
Stay back! Stay back!

311
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:58,894
Everybody else stay back!

312
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,606
I don't want you in there. Move back.

313
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,027
All of you, stay back! Let's go! Move back!

314
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,882
-What's going on here?
-Big guy tripped.

315
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:27,798
-Thai so, Bill?
-Yeah, I tripped.

316
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,471
That's what he says.

317
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,310
All right, let's go! Keep it moving!

318
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,012
- Come on, move!
- - Get moving! Move! Move!

319
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,188
Who's the little guy'?

320
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,479
-His name's Lists.
-Lists?

321
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,944
You'll work it out.

322
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:48,118
You ever hear of a computer?
You're, like, a century behind everyone.

323
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,412
I'm surprised I don't find an abacus in here.

324
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,956
-What are you doing in my office?
-I'm here for him.

325
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,000
Carl Lucas.
Even the name gives me a hard-on.

326
00:33:56,827 --> 00:34:00,923
The judge called him a monster at his trial.
He's perfect.

327
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,421
-l can sell him.
-You can't have him.

328
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,344
-I wasn't asking your permission.
-Wait. There's more to it.

329
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,172
DA thinks there's a chance

330
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,301
that he could turn state witness
against Markus Kane.

331
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,809
Now, you put him on your TV show,

332
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,389
not only could those animals kill him,

333
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:22,695
but basically, he just advertises to Kane
where the chief witness against him sleeps,

334
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,905
and then he's a dead man.

335
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,154
Mr. Lucas' problem, not mine.

336
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,036
Warden Parks, you and your prison
exist for one reason,

337
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,077
to facilitate Death Match.

338
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,203
And here I thought we were here
to protect society and punish criminals.

339
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,338
Then you're dumber than I thought.

340
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,844
Give us a minute.

341
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,888
Would you like a towel?

342
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,478
I'm time.

343
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,651
Yeah, I'll say.

344
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,230
Very impressive.

345
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,154
And your fight with Big Bill yesterday,

346
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,074
also impressive.

347
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,999
-I don't think we've met. I'm...
-Yeah, I know who you are.

348
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,460
Save the sales pitch, huh?

349
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:03,878
I'm not fighting.

350
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,341
If I want you to tight, you fight.

351
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,793
-Is that right?
-Yes.

352
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,513
I can't do anything about the life sentences,

353
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,095
but you participate,

354
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,769
and I will make your life here
much more tolerable.

355
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,770
Your own cell, no work detail,

356
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,728
real food,

357
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,443
as well as plenty of

358
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,205
-perks.
-Okay.

359
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,663
So, I...

360
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,175
I win some tights for you,

361
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,921
you need another guy to beat me.

362
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,053
I mean, that's...

363
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,726
That's how it works, right?

364
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,272
Yeah.

365
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,144
Okay.

366
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,987
Hey,

367
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,443
go sell sleazy someplace else,

368
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,537
'cause I ain't buying.

369
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:24,202
-You won't leave me any choice.
-Do what you gotta do.

370
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,544
I'm not gonna be a part of your freak show.

371
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,209
We'll see.

372
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,339
Hey.

373
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:37,180
You don't hear the word "no" so often,
do you?

374
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,721
Only when I say it.

375
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:48,066
Dim the lights,
the carnage is about to begin.

376
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,524
Good evening,
and welcome to Death Match.

377
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:57,318
Two men will be randomly selected live,
right before your eyes.

378
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,444
Only the winner walks out alive.

379
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,948
Are there any fighters in here tonight?

380
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,552
I need one more.

381
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,065
No! No!

382
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,396
This is fucking bullshit.

383
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,607
Welcome to Death Match.

384
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,361
Hey! Hey, lady. Okay, you made your point.

385
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,205
-Switch us up.
-Oh, so now you wanna fight?

386
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,492
Fucking right. They're gonna kill him
in there, you know that.

387
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,997
Yeah, I certainly hope so.
The name of the game is Death Match.

388
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,371
What the fuck is wrong with you?

389
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,922
Hey! Get your fucking hands...

390
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,336
There are two ways to win.
Kill your opponent or make him submit.

391
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,180
There are several
pressure plates that, when activated

392
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,974
can give a fighter access
to a variety of weapons.

393
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:07,516
And this week we have a new weapon
that will blow your mind.

394
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,524
Come on!

395
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,492
Fuck him up, Bill!

396
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,123
Come on! Come on!

397
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:33,914
Mother...

398
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,848
Motherfucker's crazy!

399
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:45,300
But cool.

400
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,063
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I want on the floor. Can you help?

401
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:10,746
Get him, Luke!

402
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,023
Watch out!

403
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,150
Watch out!

404
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,706
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

405
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:58,748
Don't look good for our boy.

406
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,598
This way! This way! Come on!

407
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,645
The door, Luke! The door!

408
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,308
This is some bullshit! This game is rigged!

409
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,146
- Barbecue his white ass!
- - Yo, the white boy's cheating!

410
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:24,195
-Fucking cracker's cheating!
-Fuck you, you nigger!

411
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:25,984
-You piece of shit!
-Watch out!

412
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,667
Come on!

413
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,548
Come on! Let's gel in there!

414
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,270
Come on, come on! Go, go! Get out there!

415
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,018
I told you.

416
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,064
Switch!

417
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:26,632
Go, go, go!

418
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,770
Get the fuck over here!
Come on! Come on!

419
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:40,980
Get back.

420
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,111
Watch out, Luke!

421
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,641
Get ready to scream, bitch!

422
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,067
-Fuck you!
-Who's screaming now, bitch?

423
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:24,819
Code red, arena stage.

424
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,818
-End transmission now.
-Are you fucking crazy?

425
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,366
-Shut it down.
-No way. This is my show.

426
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,160
And this is my prison.
End this broadcast now

427
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,534
or you're gonna be one of the cons
instead of just filming them.

428
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,743
Got it.

429
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,201
Death Match is a trademark
of Wayland International.

430
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,208
Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts should not be duplicated at home.

431
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,920
Get on the ground!

432
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,132
Luke!

433
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,673
Come on, get on the bus!

434
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,891
You wanna live'? Stay down.

435
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:34,259
Wasn't that Luke?

436
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,346
What?

437
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,477
Fuck!

438
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,389
Get me the phone!

439
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,144
Fuck.

440
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,610
Just relax, huh? Just relax.
Won't hurt a bit. Relax.

441
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,109
Any closer, buddy...

442
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,783
You're really lucky,
or this would have hit the femoral artery.

443
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,825
-Yeah, that's me. Lucky.
-Yeah. You can say that.

444
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,451
-Man!
-Just relax. Relax.

445
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:08,919
It's a minor setback.
A few rapists and murderers died. Boo-hoo.

446
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,545
No. This is the end.

447
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,761
You messed it up by pulling the plug.
We would've won the night.

448
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,678
You're not good enough in bed
to win this one.

449
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,182
Sweet dreams.

450
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:33,906
Come on, over here.

451
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,196
Fuck.

452
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,494
Sit down there and shut up.

453
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,915
-Quiet down.
-Hey.

454
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:44,742
What happened?

455
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,711
You're not the only one
that got in some good shots.

456
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,708
-- I know.
- All right, ladies! Line it up!

457
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,586
The bus is leaving.
Don't make me tell you twice!

458
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,512
-- Hey.
- Let's go.

459
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,015
-- Thanks, huh?
- Step through, ladies!

460
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,146
Yeah. I don't know why I did it.

461
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,690
Probably get thrown in the hole for that.

462
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,735
Then why?

463
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,105
Why did you help that con?

464
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,988
Wasn't gonna let the man fight my fight.

465
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,029
Right this way. Let's go.

466
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:27,206
You gut a name?

467
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,004
Uh-huh. Yeah. Of course I do.

468
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:35,668
Come on, man.

469
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,888
There he is.

470
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,266
How the fuck is he still alive?

471
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,938
JOEY; Boss, we've been
assured it's happening.

472
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,641
It's been happening for weeks now.

473
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,018
How much longer
do you think he's gonna stay silent?

474
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:54,103
He's a tough guy, and he's been loyal...

475
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,063
I want him dead!

476
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,400
We have someone on the inside,
a total psycho.

477
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,572
-It won't take long now.
-.Joey. Joey.

478
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:06,329
The box, with its implications
of rigidity and squareness,

479
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:11,379
symbolises unimaginative thinking
and painful frustration.

480
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,885
Sometimes
we just have to step back

481
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,934
see if the solutions to our problem
lies outside the box.

482
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:27,891
Calla meeting.

483
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,729
-With who?
-Everyone!

484
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,939
-You didn't return my calls.
-I don't return a lot of calls.

485
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,274
I wanna discuss Death Match.
I think that we should pull the plug.

486
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:42,486
When a real-life not doesn't generate
a second-hour boost,

487
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,660
-I'd say it's time to cut your loss.
-Exactly. We need to evolve.

488
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,663
We've developed a strong base,
we have legitimate TV stars...

489
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,370
The board's decision is final, Miss Jones.

490
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,002
In the past six months, I'm the only
profitable thing about this company.

491
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:03,010
Unless you want a sexual harassment suit
crammed down your throat,

492
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,091
you will listen to what I have to say.

493
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,107
Fine.

494
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,189
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

495
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,802
I'm troubled.

496
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:54,599
What seemed to be a very simple task
has taken the most perplexing of turns.

497
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:58,478
So I'm gonna speak slowly,

498
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:00,563
clearly,

499
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:05,071
so my message is not lost, or ignored,
or misinterpreted.

500
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:10,999
One million dollars to the man
who kills Carl Lucas.

501
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,044
This offer expires in 48 hours,
and if that happens,

502
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,628
I will consider you all enemies,

503
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,089
and I will bring war on your fucking head.

504
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,222
Understand?

505
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,263
Ninety percent
of Terminal Island,

506
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:36,316
your grand investment, is dead space.

507
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,901
Death Match merely stayed your execution.

508
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,071
If you wanna get a breath of fresh air,
you need a bold initiative.

509
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,906
I propose 3 race.

510
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:46,025
Wicked. Epic.

511
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,279
Something like no one has ever seen before.

512
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,417
The track will run the length
of Terminal Island

513
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,790
along some of the narrowest
and most harrowing paths

514
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,121
that the racing world has to offer.

515
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:02,634
The best part of it, everything that we need
is right in our own backyard.

516
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,968
We're gonna modify each vehicle,

517
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:08,260
adding reinforced steel plating,
bulletproof glass, and roll cages

518
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,592
to at least give the drivers a fighting chance.

519
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,598
We'll take everything
that made Death Match a hit,

520
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:15,271
combine it with everything
we have at our disposal.

521
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,143
Such as?

522
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:18,566
Heavy fucking artillery.

523
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:26,445
Every car will hold as many
guns and as much ammunition as it can,

524
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,237
So, you're going to arm the prisoners.

525
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:35,204
Precautions will be made to make sure
they can only shoot at people on the track.

526
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:40,793
Nine cars, three days,
20,000 rounds of ammunition.

527
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,469
Going from righting to racing,
that's a big leap.

528
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:52,767
We need a hook.
Something that incorporates the two better.

529
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:58,690
Now, in a game show, no one cares
about the game. The game's arbitrary.

530
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,939
People care about the risk and the money.

531
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:06,318
Now, we've been concentrating on the game,
not the risk.

532
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,323
That's why our audience is bored.

533
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,568
Let's concentrate on the prize.

534
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,871
A prize more valuable than money.

535
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,499
Okay. What's more valuable than money?

536
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:21,121
Life

537
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:24,165
is a more valuable prize than money.

538
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:27,339
In our deal with the state,
we control sentencing.

539
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,586
That means we control their life.

540
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,844
So if a prisoner wins five races,
he gets his freedom.

541
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:37,099
No matter what he's in for,
robbery, rape, homicide, whatever,

542
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:39,806
he wins his freedom.

543
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,016
He wins his life.

544
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,143
You have life,

545
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,187
freedom.

546
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,488
Stop.

547
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:57,866
Death Race.

548
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,966
You know what?
That's fucking bullshit, Rocco.

549
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,048
Well, how do you know, man?
Maybe ifs for real.

550
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,128
Are you kidding me?

551
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:14,386
You think they're gonna let murderers
and rapists out of this place, ever'?

552
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,138
Hey, Luke's right.

553
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:19,141
And besides that, homes,
you don't drive worth a shit.

554
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,393
You know what? Fucking blow me.

555
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,568
Fucking faggot.

556
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,236
That would be the only chance I have
of getting out.

557
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,031
And what would you do, Lists,
if you got out?

558
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,245
Start over.

559
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,834
Welcome to Death Race.

560
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:54,764
Terminal Island Penitentiary hosts
three days of the ultimate in auto carnage.

561
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,183
Day one of the race begins in 10 minutes,

562
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,560
and will be brought to you
without commercial interruption

563
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:04,274
by Wayland International
Your safety is our top priority.

564
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,401
Get ready. The show's about to begin.

565
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,620
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.

566
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,374
Welcome to day one
of Death Race.

567
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,589
Before you, 18 cons vie for their freedom.

568
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,135
They must survive all three laps
in order to proceed to day two.

569
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,141
Their first challenge?

570
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,760
There are only nine cars.

571
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:45,147
That's right, gentlemen. Nine cars!

572
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,485
Three, two, one,

573
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:51,812
90;

574
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,677
This is what I'm talking about!

575
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,681
Mine!

576
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,195
This just keeps getting better and better!

577
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,197
-Hey, baby.
-How about a bit v rodet?

578
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,048
Oh, baby, yeah!

579
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,512
Don't think so!

580
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:11,559
Why did you let that con beat you?

581
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,650
-Shit!
-Hang on!

582
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:24,496
-Fuck!
-Hey, why do I need this?

583
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:26,916
-You mind helping me out with this?
-Yeah. Yeah. Who am I talking to'?

584
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,076
-To talk to your pit team.
-Pit team?

585
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,036
Luke! Good to have you, man.

586
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:35,253
So, you got your guns, your oil, your smoke,
and your napalm here.

587
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,753
-Get your eyes on the road.
-Let's race.

588
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,439
Luke! Goldberg.

589
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:59,273
Yeah. The Mexican Jew's here
to save your bony white ass.

590
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,242
Now, swords and shields don't play
until the second lap.

591
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:06,371
You've got the fastest car out there,
except the Porsche.

592
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,291
And don't go head-to-head with that Ram,
or he'll have you for lunch.

593
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,743
Son of a bitch!

594
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,218
Looks like we're already on the menu.

595
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,760
Eat this.

596
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,134
You feel me, baby?

597
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,978
-Now I got you, baby!
-ls that all you got, pretty boy?

598
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,308
Careful of the one on the right!

599
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,147
Good to know.

600
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,492
-Yeah! That's my man!
-Yes!

601
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,333
-Where is he? Where is he?
-To the left.

602
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,624
Xander Grady.

603
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,503
- Come on!
- - Get it going!

604
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,764
Fucking Chinese bastard! I'll kill you!

605
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,942
Shit! Bastard!

606
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,020
Motherfucker!

607
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:32,370
That was a great lap, Luke, but now
you need to get to a sword plate, and fast.

608
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,792
Activate swords, shields and death heads.

609
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,369
Sword pressure plates activated.

610
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,037
Shield pressure plates activated.

611
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:41,291
You gotta find a sword, Luke.
You gotta find a sword plate.

612
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,048
That's right. Get back to work.

613
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,636
There's one!

614
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,552
-I see it.
-Go for it. Go for it!

615
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,724
Sword pressure plate activated.

616
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,981
Yeah!
How do you like that one, boy?

617
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,059
What the hell is he doing?

618
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,902
What the hell is he doing?

619
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,355
-Oh, jeez!
-Guns! Guns!

620
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,367
Eat my lead, boy! Eat my lead!

621
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:12,910
Get down! Now!

622
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,658
-- Hey, get out of there!
- Get down!

623
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:18,913
How's it feel, boy?

624
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,251
You gotta turn here!

625
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:24,543
I'm working on it.

626
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,052
Hang on.

627
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:39,108
God! Oh, God, no!

628
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,772
Yeah!

629
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,824
-- Ooh, yeah!
- That was close.

630
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,529
Stock car racing
got its start during Prohibition

631
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:54,365
with moonshine runners
fleeing federal agents.

632
00:58:54,865 --> 00:59:00,122
Bill France Sr. conceived NASCAR in 1947
during a meeting in Daytona, Florida.

633
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,091
"Lists." I get it now.

634
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,936
Shield pressure plates activated.

635
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:28,986
Motherfucker.

636
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,020
-Get a close-up on that.
- Camera two, move to your left.

637
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,026
Where did he go? Huh?

638
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:09,856
Where did he go?

639
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:14,490
You ain't escaping me now.

640
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:18,870
A million dollars. It's gonna be mine.

641
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,325
What did he just say?

642
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,035
Replay that for me.

643
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,004
A million dollars.
Its gonna be mine.

644
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:27,545
I'll take care of it.

645
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:41,726
Take the wheel.

646
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,486
Take that, bitch.
Think you're special?

647
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,702
No!

648
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,242
No! No!

649
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:10,341
No!

650
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:36,448
One lap to go, Luke. This is it.

651
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:39,071
Stay with me, baby. Stay with me.

652
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:41,619
Oh, yeah!

653
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:45,619
Yeah!

654
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,792
-Damn it!
-Get out of there! Get out of there!

655
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,797
Enough of this shit.

656
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,090
-What the hell?
-Hang on.

657
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,471
Stay with me. Stay with me.

658
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:02,473
-What's he doing?
-I don't know.

659
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,826
Yeah! All right! All right!

660
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,411
Bullshit, motherfucker!

661
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,446
That's it. That's it.

662
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,661
Sword pressure plate activated.

663
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,662
Not that one!

664
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,623
Did you just drop our fucking tombstone?

665
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:34,834
Yeah, my bad.

666
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,261
Not good.

667
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,180
What you doing?

668
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,265
-What you doing?
-Drive, pretty boy.

669
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:44,682
"Pretty boy."

670
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,148
God damn this fucking car!

671
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:51,351
Hang on!

672
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:55,189
Take this, you asshole!

673
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:56,941
-Eat that!
-Fuck!

674
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,863
-- Hang on!
- You're going down!

675
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,194
That's nice work.

676
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,533
Talk to me!

677
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,377
Now you're going down!

678
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:16,877
Sweet!

679
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,216
I guess I lucked out, then.

680
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,305
Nice.

681
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:24,388
-Guess we put that magic to work Goldberg.
-Well, brave!

682
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,053
Come on, Luke! Yeah!

683
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,893
The debut
of Death Race is in the books.

684
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,225
Carl Lucas is the surprise winner

685
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:36,656
followed by Big Bill, Calin, Apache,
Xander and 14K.

686
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:40,571
Can Carl Lucas hold on to win his freedom?

687
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:43,408
Tune in tomorrow to find out.

688
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,418
Yeah! Yeah!

689
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,884
-Man! You can drive, man!
-What a rush, old man.

690
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,261
Hey, Goldberg, you kidding me'?

691
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,268
Hey, where'd you learn that?

692
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:09,763
-I was a Girl Scout.
-Really?

693
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,938
-- I'm gonna get you, fucker!
- ls that right?

694
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:15,686
You don't mess with somebody
in this motherfucking race!

695
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:16,861
-Is that a fucking date?
-Yeah!

696
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:19,281
-Yaah? Come on! Fucking pretty boy!
-Gonna fucking blow up your ass!

697
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,944
Come on, suck my dick, bitch!

698
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:23,952
Hey, Lists, go kick his ass. Come on.

699
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:35,043
Tomorrow, you die.

700
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,132
Katrina! Let's go.

701
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:56,109
-Hey, so I get to see you tomorrow, or what?
-If you're lucky.

702
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:08,822
Damn.

703
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,742
Hey, come on, snap out of it, guys.

704
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:15,454
Hey, Lists, you gotta fix it up there
under here.

705
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,960
Right here. Right in here.

706
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,601
Come on, Lucas, let's go.

707
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,975
- You heard him. Move.
- - Hey, what did I do?

708
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,983
Goto sleep!

709
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:48,366
Hey, this is bullshit!

710
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:56,454
Okay, what did I do'?

711
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:57,958
You won!

712
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:01,712
To the victor belongs the spoils.

713
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:03,884
Okay, so what does that mean'?

714
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,214
What is this?

715
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:13,846
In ancient Rome, the winning gladiator
was the recipient of gifts.

716
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,849
A show of gratitude from the powers that be

717
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,518
for a job well done.

718
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,403
She's yours.

719
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,076
Mmm-hmm.

720
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,536
Do with her what you please.

721
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:32,580
Is that right?

722
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,241
And who the fuck are you?

723
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:37,915
I'm Caesar.

724
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,431
You know, they're probably watching.

725
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,438
Mmm-hmm.

726
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,606
Listening, too, I guess.

727
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,064
Some kind of game they're playing.

728
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:04,524
Yeah, probably betting
on what we'll do next.

729
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:07,278
Option A, they're trying to get us closer

730
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:10,944
so they can use one of us against the other.

731
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,279
Uh-huh.

732
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:16,746
Option B being, maybe, put a wedge
between us, so we fuck up on the track?

733
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,960
I guess we do what they want,

734
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,627
and leave the bullshit for later.

735
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,553
You playing me?

736
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:32,886
Does it matter?

737
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:37,141
No.

738
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,548
Kane put a million-dollar bounty on Lucas,

739
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,001
and all the bangers are going for it.

740
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,642
Put Mr. Lucas in solitary.

741
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:01,472
I thought this was a prison thing, but this is
too big for even the guards to resist.

742
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:04,023
-You still gonna let him race?
-Oh, yeah.

743
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:07,227
They're free to kill him on the track,
just not off camera.

744
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:08,399
What about him?

745
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,079
Wait! Wait!

746
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:36,847
Come on. Let's go.

747
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,267
You had your fun. Move.

748
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,595
-Where are we going?
-Shut up.

749
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:48,022
What the fuck is this?

750
01:09:57,193 --> 01:10:00,037
Beautiful view of freedom from here, Katrina.

751
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,906
Okay.

752
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:03,578
But who are you?

753
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,956
You're much more attractive in person.

754
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:13,718
I'm flattered. What do you want?

755
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,131
Carl Lucas. I want him dead.

756
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:22,136
And in return, I offer you freedom.

757
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,810
A chance of life outside these walls

758
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,900
for one simple task.

759
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,773
You've got 48 hours.
You kill him or I kill you.

760
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,952
Let me make these walls disappear.

761
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,502
Let me make you part of the view
from outside, Katrina.

762
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:49,670
Freedom.

763
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,173
Forty-eight hours.

764
01:10:58,504 --> 01:10:59,676
Tick-tuck.

765
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,033
-- Yeah?
- Sixty-Eve share.

766
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:24,868
Well done, young lady.

767
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,669
It's truly for the best.

768
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:38,887
You weren't happy, the board wasn't happy.

769
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:42,383
We need someone for this institution
that shares the common vision.

770
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,346
Just wasn't you.

771
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:49,390
Warden Parks,
we're hereto escort you from the premises.

772
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,899
"whosoever diggeth a pit shall fall therein."

773
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,031
Proverb 26:27.

774
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:01,780
Is that supposed to be deep?

775
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,195
Hopefully deep enough that, when you fall,

776
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:06,281
you'll break your fucking neck.

777
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,932
-What do you want?
-Time to race.

778
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,464
You got a big fucking bulls-eye
- on your back Luke.

779
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:05,931
You feel all those eyes on you?

780
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:09,136
Ain't 'cause you're pretty
or because you're in first place.

781
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,772
Markus Kane put a million dollars
on your head.

782
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:16,313
It's a monster fucking bounty, Lucas.

783
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:17,985
It's as plain as day.

784
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:19,812
I don't believe it.

785
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:21,647
Why would I lie?

786
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,033
It makes no fucking sense.

787
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:27,821
What're you gonna do?

788
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:51,227
Two, one, and we're in.

789
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:54,017
Welcome to Death Race.

790
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:58,485
Eighteen men started. Only six remain.

791
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,861
An estimated 50 million people
watched Carl Lucas win day one.

792
01:14:03,398 --> 01:14:04,695
Can he do it again?

793
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,369
Five other racers will have something to say
about that.

794
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:11,866
Welcome to day two of Death Race.

795
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:17,040
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.

796
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:26,547
Hey! Aren't you two just
bubbling over with sunshine this morning?

797
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,219
Come on. We got a race to win.

798
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:35,554
What is it?

799
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:39,058
Nothing.

800
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:41,728
Let's race.

801
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,078
I've got you now, motherfucker!

802
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,245
Coming up behind you!

803
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:01,247
Watch out!

804
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,543
Yeah! I just fucked your ass!

805
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:09,088
Activate swords and shields.

806
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,933
-Sword plate activated.
-Damn!

807
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,806
-Watch your back!
-Careful.

808
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:20,433
Here comes the guns.

809
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:25,021
You gotta End a shield, man.

810
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:26,151
You gotta find a shield!

811
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,398
-There's one!
-I see it.

812
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:28,778
Go for it. Go for ii!

813
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:33,078
Shield pressure plate activated.

814
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:37,617
-Throw the smoke!
-No, not yet.

815
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,537
Luke, what're you waiting for?

816
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:41,667
Okay, ready?

817
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:42,789
Pull it now!

818
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,295
Smoke, now.

819
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:09,987
Let's get this car back in the race.

820
01:16:17,115 --> 01:16:18,162
Fuck!

821
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:23,330
Yeah! Great shit!

822
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:33,885
Okay, baby, now we come.

823
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:35,683
Sword plate activated.

824
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,555
Go, go! Get gun! Get gun!

825
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:41,639
-- Watch your back!
- Get your ass out of there, Luke.

826
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:44,980
Bounty is mine, motherfucker!

827
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:48,187
I'm tired of this asshole.

828
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:49,735
Time to lose.

829
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:52,529
Oh, my God.

830
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:53,906
Hang on.

831
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:35,239
Dig that!

832
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:56,509
Still taking it, huh?

833
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:58,466
-You die!
-Come on!

834
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,468
Today! Today you die!

835
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,762
What do you got, huh?

836
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:18,077
Beautiful.

837
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:43,053
All right, ifs clear sailing
to the finish line now.

838
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,474
What are you doing?

839
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:54,485
-The enemy of my enemy.
-What's happening?

840
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:56,740
You die.

841
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:19,847
You wanna tell me why
you just risked our lives to save that banger?

842
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,766
They're Triads. The only people
Markus would not deal with.

843
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:25,849
That's why they're not after us.
They have no clue about the hit.

844
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:32,189
Look, it's a Triad kill thing.
It's a life for a life.

845
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,854
I save his, he owes me a favour.

846
01:19:56,584 --> 01:19:58,427
-Well, I saved your life.
-Really? How so?

847
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:02,890
Because your Markus Kane offered
to buy my freedom if I would kill you.

848
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,388
Jesus! They all want me dead, now you, too?

849
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:12,062
-I guess you owe me a favour, too.
-I can't wait.

850
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:16,650
-Hey! I want a favour, too, huh?
-Fuck off, Goldberg.

851
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:22,826
Yeah, I got you, baby.

852
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:24,904
Sword pressure plates activated.

853
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:27,497
Shield ahead.

854
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:30,334
Shield pressure plate activated.

855
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:31,581
Okay, ready?

856
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:33,253
Activate the napalm on my signal.

857
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:37,504
Now.

858
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:42,797
-- What's this?
- It's not working!

859
01:20:43,798 --> 01:20:44,845
What's wrong?

860
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,009
-This is not good, Luke.
-It's a setup.

861
01:20:49,804 --> 01:20:51,431
Yeah. I'm coming, baby!

862
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,152
Hey, Goldberg.
Someone had a play date with this car.

863
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,148
I got nothing. No guns, no smoke, nothing.

864
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,945
Come on, hit it, you dumbass bitch!

865
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:03,655
Swerve! Swerve!

866
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,611
-You, motherfucker!
-Tum!

867
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:06,953
What can I do?

868
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,282
-Brace yourself.
-No! What are you doing?

869
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:11,326
Get the fuck out cf there!

870
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,287
Come on! You need to gel out of there!

871
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:17,506
This is my tight.

872
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,042
No choice. Hang on.

873
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:29,643
Here I come!

874
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,222
Motherfucker won't stop tiring!

875
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:38,026
Heat-seeking missile
- has been activated.

876
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,070
-Come on!
-Hey! Get out of there!

877
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,372
Come on.

878
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,693
-Yeah! Shit!
-Yeah!

879
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,028
-What the fuck?
-You just killed your own pit crew.

880
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:31,580
Bitch, you shut the fuck up.

881
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:54,429
-Goldberg.
-Hey, get out of there!

882
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:01,310
Get in that car! I want a close-up.

883
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:03,187
Get me out of here!

884
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:05,022
Oh, God!

885
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:20,792
No!

886
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,509
Oh, my God, no!

887
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:34,973
Somebody help!

888
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,768
Goldberg, get him out! Get him out!

889
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,584
No.

890
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,027
Rest in peace, Luke.

891
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:39,408
Rocco!

892
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:44,247
-You gotta answer for Luke.
-What the fuck you talking about?

893
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:47,374
Katrina said ii was rigged from the inside.

894
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:50,007
And you're the only motherfucker
that could have got to it.

895
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,587
You killed him?

896
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:56,141
Getaway from me. Fuck you both.

897
01:25:03,474 --> 01:25:04,521
-I need to talk to him.
-No.

898
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:05,939
He saved your life!

899
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:12,237
You owe him.

900
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:14,865
A life for a life.

901
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:17,905
I know what to do.

902
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:31,256
We've induced coma.
Thankfully all his vitals have stabilised

903
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,468
but he should be moved to a facility
more suited to his needs.

904
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:37,678
Out of the question.

905
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:41,513
Doctor someone from the outside
tried to kill him.

906
01:25:42,221 --> 01:25:45,566
Unless they think he's dead,
they'll come back to finish the job.

907
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:49,437
Yeah, well, I can't pronounce a man dead
while he's still alive.

908
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:51,651
Can't you?

909
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:03,910
How are we doing
with finding a replacement for Parks?

910
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:05,916
She comes highly recommended
from Halliburton.

911
01:26:06,412 --> 01:26:08,915
She ran their maximum security
detention centre.

912
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,755
She's strong. She's smart.
Ruthlessly ambitious.

913
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:14,678
I think if I weren't around, she'd tell people
that Death Race was her idea

914
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:16,596
and she'd convince them that it was.

915
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,598
How's the switchover to the Internet?

916
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:19,926
Transitions complete.

917
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,557
We start streaming live worldwide tomorrow.

918
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:25,348
The numbers have
already surpassed pay-per-view,

919
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:26,853
thanks to the Frankenstein commercial.

920
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:28,104
Hold on. Wait.

921
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:31,612
I've been meaning to talk to you
about this Frankenstein.

922
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:39,278
Did you make him up?

923
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:42,956
Frankenstein most certainly exists,

924
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:44,950
and he will be in the race tomorrow.

925
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:47,957
He better be.

926
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:53,134
And he better come as good as advertised.

927
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:06,643
The procedure's
experimental and dangerous.

928
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:09,145
We're talking about placing
electrodes into the brain.

929
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:10,810
You told me
he was a perfect candidate.

930
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:11,985
Oh, he is.

931
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:13,604
But there are no guarantees.

932
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:15,986
Let's wake him up.

933
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:30,329
Mn Lucas.

934
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:35,172
You've got second-degree burns
over 85% of your body.

935
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:40,465
Now you're lucky that you suffered
no significant injuries.

936
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,970
Not a broken bone or damaged organ,

937
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:47,685
which is remarkable
considering the intensity of the fire.

938
01:27:54,144 --> 01:27:55,771
So, this is hell?

939
01:27:58,690 --> 01:27:59,816
Why?

940
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,029
Where else would you be?

941
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:06,915
You do remember me.

942
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:10,744
You win five races and you're free.

943
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:13,877
You're out of your fucking mind.

944
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:17,380
No more Markus Kane
trying to track you down.

945
01:28:18,544 --> 01:28:19,716
Like a second chance.

946
01:28:21,547 --> 01:28:22,890
Look at me.

947
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:25,224
Really. Look at me.

948
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:34,021
What kind of second chance would I have?

949
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:38,272
You're either
Frankenstein or you're nobody.

950
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,279
You're certainly not Carl Lucas any more.

951
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:44,286
The entire world watched him incinerate.

952
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:47,372
There's even a death certificate.

953
01:28:48,115 --> 01:28:49,583
I pity you.

954
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:52,586
Okay
If you don't do it for your life,

955
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:55,088
then you do it for Katrina.

956
01:28:56,081 --> 01:29:00,211
I'll furlough five of my worst sodomites
for a play date with sweet Katrina.

957
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,802
By the time they're finished with hen
