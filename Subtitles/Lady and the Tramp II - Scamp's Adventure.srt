2
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:26,025
To this

3
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,362
Small, little, not too big, little, homey

4
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,824
Nice, little, quaint, little, always kindly

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,119
Old New England town

6
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,371
Welcome

7
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,042
If you're new to the place
And feeling uneasy

8
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:44,377
Fret not a bit

9
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:49,632
In this always friendly
old New England town

10
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:55,680
Welcome

11
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,517
To our family picnic

12
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:03,146
July Fourth picnic

13
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:09,485
Independence Day

14
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,489
Aunt Sarah!

15
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,450
Will we see you at the picnic
the day after tomorrow?

16
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:16,909
Of course!

17
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,537
My precious kitties
love the Fourth of July.

18
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,624
Whether next of kin
or next-door neighbour

19
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,670
Happily, we pool our labour
to give our town a new face

20
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,423
A nifty new look!

21
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,509
A red, white, and a blue look!

22
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,388
And when we're done,
you'll never know the place

23
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,142
At our family picnic

24
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,895
July Fourth picnic

25
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,564
Independence

26
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,232
Day

27
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,488
There's a buzzing in the air

28
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,032
Children running everywhere

29
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,701
As all of us prepare

30
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,454
For that once-a-year, wonderful day

31
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,539
And our spirits are so high

32
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,375
Feels like Christmas in July

33
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,836
As we pray the hours fly

34
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,880
To that star-spangled

35
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:15,092
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful day

36
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,182
We can hardly wait
to bathe and dress up

37
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,518
We love picnics, we confess, yup

38
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,062
With Darling and with Jim Dear

39
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:30,733
We've made a home
from which we'll never roam

40
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,068
Why would we

41
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,530
When we're so contented here?

42
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,199
In this fine, little, not too

43
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,743
Big, little, cosy

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,746
Warm, little, swell, little

45
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,707
Always loving

46
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,837
Old New England home

47
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,339
In our small, little, not too big

48
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,591
Little, homey, nice, little, quaint, little

49
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,968
Always friendly

50
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:01,472
Old New England town

51
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:10,982
Welcome

52
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,984
Welcome!

53
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,778
All right, time for a bath!

54
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,446
The water's hot.

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,284
Oh, excellent! I love getting a bath.

56
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,954
It makes my fur so silky smooth.

57
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,330
Yeah!

58
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,832
-Me first!
-No, me first!

59
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,667
No, not you! Wait a minute!

60
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,336
I hate baths.

61
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,255
Just the same, Scamp,

62
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,299
when you live in a house,
you need to be clean.

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,467
Well, then I'm glad I'm a wild dog.

64
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,976
Scamp, you know you're
not supposed to climb

65
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,102
on the furniture.

66
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,480
Now get down from there
before you break something.

67
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,358
Hey, let's do some dog stuff, huh, Pop?

68
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,820
You know, dig up bones, rip up flowers,

69
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,447
chase cats!

70
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,158
Scamp, come on now.

71
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,327
You're gonna make a mess.

72
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,329
-Got it!
-Dad!

73
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,045
Tramp?

74
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,839
I hope you're not making
a mess in there.

75
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,009
All right, whirlwind, time to settle down.

76
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,012
Why don't you go play with Junior?

77
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,895
Scamp play!

78
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,357
Scamp!

79
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,569
Look what you did to my favourite hat.

80
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,279
If I've told you once,

81
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,532
I've told you a thousand times. No!

82
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,495
Let's see if you
can behave long enough

83
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,246
for me to give you a bath.

84
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,207
Bad Scamp!

85
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,710
Scamp, stop squirming.

86
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,881
Bad Scamp! Bad, bad, bad Scamp!

87
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,096
Well, it's about time you settled down.

88
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,306
There. All done.

89
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,432
Scamp!

90
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,685
Play ball!

91
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,438
Hey, come back here!

92
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,067
Scamp, catch the ball!

93
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:21,946
Come back here now!

94
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,575
No, no, no, no, no, no!

95
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,744
Yay! Yay!

96
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,998
Scamp! Scamp!

97
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,254
-Play ball!
-Scamp! Oh, no!

98
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,922
What a mess!

99
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,758
This time, you've gone too far!

100
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,636
You've left me no choice.

101
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,810
Some dogs just have
to learn the hard way.

102
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,312
Maybe chaining you up
will teach you a lesson.

103
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,360
I'm sorry, pal, but I just
don't know what else to do.

104
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,033
-Serves him right.
-Simply incorrigible.

105
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,534
He brought this on himself.

106
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,870
Now we'll need another bath.

107
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,663
-Me first!
-No, me first!

108
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,123
Not you first!

109
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,133
Tramp?

110
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,852
Best thing Jim Dear
could have done for our boy,

111
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,395
chainin' him up.

112
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,565
Tramp, he's never
been chained up before.

113
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,525
He's just a pup.

114
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,029
He has to learn to live
by the rules of the house.

115
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,740
Firm discipline moulds a pup into a dog.

116
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,826
You turned out pretty good.

117
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,204
Yeah, Pidge, but I found you.

118
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:57,083
And if it weren't for you,
I'd have wound up in the pound.

119
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,668
I'm just trying to protect him.

120
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,879
He'll understand someday.

121
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,842
Maybe he needs to understand today.

122
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,315
I thought you might be hungry.

123
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,071
I'm sorry, pal.

124
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,573
You're just gonna have
to shape up a little, that's all.

125
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,326
I always get blamed for everything.

126
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,454
Sometimes it's hard
bein' part of a family.

127
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,915
You have to obey certain rules.

128
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,377
But I want to run wild and free,
like a real dog!

129
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,923
Son, the world out there is full of traps.

130
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,343
Here, you, you have
a family that loves you.

131
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,972
As long as I do what you say.

132
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,269
Pop, I just don't feel like I belong here.

133
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,021
Didn't you ever feel this way?

134
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,275
I was just like you when I was your age.

135
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,861
You were never like me.

136
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,284
You've been a house dog all your life.
How would you know?

137
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,494
Oh, you'd be surprised.

138
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,455
Scamp, I'm only trying to protect you.

139
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,749
By putting me on a chain?

140
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,710
Those are the rules, Son.

141
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,754
All I ever hear is, "Rules, rules, rules!"

142
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,465
"Don't do this!" and "Don't do that!"

143
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,720
What good are teeth and claws
if you can never use them?

144
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,765
-Stop that howling!
-I can't help it, Pop!

145
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,475
Wild dogs howl at the moon!

146
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,270
There will be no wild dogs in this family!

147
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,106
Then maybe I don't want
to be in this family.

148
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,984
Like it or not, you are
a part of this family!

149
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,819
And until you start acting like it,

150
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,156
you can just get used to
being out here every night!

151
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:30,653
Hey, Angel!

152
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,365
Why don't you come on out, 'kay?

153
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,159
I can't.

154
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,995
The pup is in chains!

155
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,706
Come back, you mangy mutt!

156
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,089
Hold still so I can take you in
all peaceable-like!

157
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,466
Hey! Where'd you go?

158
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,385
What the...

159
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,098
Hey, drop that!

160
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:05,020
Defacing a county officer's...
Oh, come on now, that's not fair.

161
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,370
Come on now, hand it over, girl.

162
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,582
Hey!

163
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,127
Hey, drop that!

164
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,757
Hey, gotcha!

165
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,760
It's off to the pound with you,
big fella! Huh?

166
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,596
You don't have to...

167
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,238
Boy, when I get out of here,
I'm gonna do somethin' fierce.

168
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,159
I'm gonna get you...

169
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,082
You little mutt!
You're gonna see what mad is!

170
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,838
I'll get you yet, you hooligans!

171
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,927
Oh, you! Come on!

172
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,866
Far from here is where I want to be

173
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,036
Somewhere out there,
loose and running

174
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,663
Nobody's leash to hold me

175
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,665
Nobody's hugs to crush me

176
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,876
Nobody's soap and scratchy comb

177
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,797
To bathe and brush me

178
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:59,134
A world without fences

179
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,888
Where I can run free

180
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,808
And be with real dogs

181
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,645
Who'll bring the real dog out in me

182
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:15,109
No walls and no boundaries

183
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,946
Where I can be free

184
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,825
A world without walls and fences

185
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:28,122
That's exactly where I want to be

186
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:39,133
This pup just won't sleep his life away

187
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,761
On some sofa, like his father

188
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,304
Too many bones to chew up

189
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,849
Too many smells to sample

190
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,644
Too many fancy flower beds
To rip and trample

191
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,446
No rules to control me

192
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,450
Stop what I want to be

193
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,870
A world without fences

194
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,833
That's the world I want for me

195
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,879
No rules, no responsibility

196
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,508
On my own, completely free

197
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,137
A world without fences

198
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:30,309
For me

199
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,688
So long, you house dogs!

200
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,609
You can't tell me what to do any more,
'cause I'm a wild dog!

201
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,614
Hey, you guys, wait for me!

202
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,145
Pretty good pickin's, huh?

203
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,940
I can see you know
your way around an alley.

204
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,192
It's that obvious?

205
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,444
Couldn't miss it if I tried.

206
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,659
This must be your diploma
from the school of hard knocks.

207
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,704
Yeah, I just graduated.

208
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,335
Then you must know this move.
Any street dog would.

209
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,926
Wow! Slick move!

210
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,929
-I mean, that's kid stuff.
-Yeah, right.

211
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,902
You've got your own style,
don't you, tenderfoot?

212
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:52,200
Listen, you don't belong on the street.
You won't last five minutes out here.

213
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,263
Get going, you crazy mutt!

214
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,559
Hey, you, get out of the street!

215
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,985
Scamp...

216
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,322
Scamp? Oh, no!

217
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,658
Tramp!

218
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,096
They're jumping on the sofa

219
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,973
and playing in the trash.

220
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,310
And breaking stuff!

221
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,316
If only there were hats to chew on.

222
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,740
Goodbye, chains! Hello, freedom!

223
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,242
Go, Buster!

224
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,203
That a way, Buster!

225
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,455
Bust his butt off, Buster!

226
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,297
So, any of you other lowlife mongrels

227
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,842
think you're dog enough
to take Buster on?

228
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,969
Don't be afraid!

229
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,721
Have no fear! Have no fear!

230
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,017
That's right, boys.

231
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,353
Junkyard dogs rule this town.

232
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,898
And Buster rules the junkyard dogs!

233
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,820
Angel! Angel! Talk to me.

234
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,155
Who's the king of the junkyard?

235
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,575
Oh, you are, Buster.

236
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,035
And it's quite a kingdom
you've got here.

237
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,830
That's my girl!

238
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,957
I'm not your girl!

239
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,460
I don't belong to anyone.

240
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,689
Hey, hey. Look here, you guys.
I'd say we got a new recruit.

241
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,192
The little house dog!

242
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,652
Hey, you got off the leash!

243
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:33,820
Yeah.

244
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,073
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Watch it!

245
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,992
Oh, be still, my heart.

246
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,995
I'm gettin' a bad case of puppy love.

247
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,164
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

248
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,417
Hey, Ruby.
I'm the top dog around here.

249
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,921
And nobody joins the junkyard dogs
unless I say so.

250
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,382
So, what's your name, sport?

251
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,926
Name's Scamp.

252
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,429
Well, howdy, Scamperoo.

253
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:03,642
So, you saw us having some fun
and thought you'd join right in, huh?

254
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,768
Yeah, sure.

255
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,062
Hey, I hate to break
the news to you, champ,

256
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,940
but not many house dogs
get to run in this pack.

257
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,400
-I'm not a house dog.
-Oh, you're not?

258
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,571
Then what's this badge of respectability
hanging around your neck?

259
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,031
Hey, collar boy!

260
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,866
How's life on the end of that chain?

261
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,160
No way!

262
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,454
I've had it with the house dog life.

263
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,165
Nothing there but rules, rules, rules.

264
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,877
I want to be wild and free,
like you guys!

265
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,171
I don't know, kid.

266
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,216
Your average house dog
ain't got what it takes.

267
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,010
Hey, tell him what it takes, Buster!
Tell him what it takes!

268
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,392
In junkyard society

269
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,854
We're repelled by all propriety

270
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,107
Humility and modesty

271
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,485
Good manners and sobriety

272
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,614
We always gulp our meat

273
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,992
Our coats are never neat

274
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,160
Alas, we lack all poise

275
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,454
We're full of natural noise

276
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:12,335
No pets you stroke and pat
You might as well be a cat

277
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:18,925
In junkyard society

278
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,513
Society

279
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,032
We are the mutual un-elite

280
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,285
An underclass from our head to feet

281
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,539
Our deeds are spiteful,
our mischief pure

282
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:52,000
We got a natural disorder

283
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,420
For which there's no cure

284
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,049
Down to the junkyard

285
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,928
Straight to the junkyard

286
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,389
Step to the junkyard

287
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,767
Society rag

288
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:17,400
That's where you're
nobody's perfumed pet

289
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,153
Where you can wet
where you want to wet

290
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:24,491
Where you put charity on the shelf

291
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,619
The only one that you'll look out for

292
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,121
Is you yourself

293
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,376
Down in the junkyard

294
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:38,338
Check out the junkyard

295
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,591
Doin' the junkyard

296
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,844
Society rag

297
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,683
No distemper shots from the vet

298
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,601
Show your temper

299
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,520
Mean as you can get

300
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,565
Down at the yard where we live and let

301
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,362
Chaos and trouble
Oh, we do it double

302
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:10,203
None of this play-it-safe
house dog stuff

303
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,707
Our days are risky, our nights are "ruff"

304
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,085
The peaceful life leaves us ill at ease

305
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:21,172
We're crude and loud in a crowd
And very proud of our fleas

306
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,216
Oh, I love this guy!

307
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:30,056
Down at the junkyard

308
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,310
Check out the junkyard

309
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,814
Step to the junkyard

310
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,526
Straight to the junkyard

311
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,530
Doin' the junkyard

312
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,784
Sing it, boy!

313
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,912
Society rag

314
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,214
What a blast!
I'd never get away with this at home.

315
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,508
So, you really think
you got what it takes

316
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,886
to be a junkyard dog, huh?

317
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,180
Oh, he's got what it takes, Buster.

318
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,348
I saw all his moves back in that alley.

319
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,810
Yeah! Yeah! Watch this slick move!

320
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,236
Talented as you are,
it ain't that easy, sport.

321
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,995
Every day out here
is like a test of survival.

322
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,580
A test!

323
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,040
Beautiful!

324
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,208
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Good!

325
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:42,003
Baby, I always get my best ideas
when you're around.

326
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,255
That's why you're my girl.

327
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,341
I'm not your girl.

328
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,469
Okay, Scampers, we'll give you a shot.

329
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,013
But you gotta pass
a little test of courage

330
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,266
in Reggie's alley.

331
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,352
-What?
-But it's never been done before!

332
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,480
Come here. Don't listen to them.
I got faith in you, kid.

333
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,898
It's just a little test

334
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,609
to prove you can stand
on your own four paws.

335
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,071
Easy. I'm not afraid of anything.

336
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,366
That's what I like about you, kid.
You got spunk.

337
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,914
-Did you call the pound?
-Yes, dear.

338
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,874
They haven't seen him.

339
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,545
Oh, Tramp.
Scamp's never been out all night.

340
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,463
So much could happen.

341
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:26,965
Hey, easy, Pidge.

342
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,844
We'll find him before he gets himself
in real trouble.

343
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:34,389
Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am!

344
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,891
We came as soon as we heard.

345
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,314
Uncle Jock! Uncle Trusty!
Scamp ran away!

346
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,440
What they said!

347
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,693
Not to worry, little ladies.

348
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:51,990
Got my grandpappy Ol' Reliable's
keen sense of smell.

349
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,744
Say, have I ever told
you girls about the time

350
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,914
I saved your father from certain death?

351
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,457
-No!
-No!

352
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:02,584
Yup!

353
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:07,213
Here he goes again.
I told you, there'll be no livin' with him.

354
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:12,135
That Scamp is gonna get
into so much trouble

355
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,470
when he gets home! Yeah!

356
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:18,349
-I don't even want him back.
-Yeah, who cares?

357
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,018
He should know better than to run off.

358
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:26,024
I bet he gets a slipper
right across his great, big, fat...

359
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,695
We really do miss him, Mom.

360
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,865
We'll be back with
your brother in no time.

361
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,618
Your old man's got twice
the speed and cunning

362
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,661
as any dog half his age.

363
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,960
Just usin' a few forgotten
muscles, that's all.

364
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,338
Lady! Tramp! Let's go!

365
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,676
Come on. No tellin' what mischief
that pup's gettin' into.

366
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:58,264
All right, Scampster. Fetch the can

367
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,974
outta the alley.

368
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,187
See ya!

369
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,138
It's a spook! A spook!

370
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,390
It's Reggie! Scatter!

371
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,874
Where, oh, where

372
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,917
Has my little dog...

373
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,086
Well, I'll be.

374
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,464
You're not gettin' away this time!

375
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,179
I gotcha now, you little hoodlum!

376
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,810
Hey! Hey, now, get off of there!

377
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,021
What are you, mad?

378
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,147
You crazy...

379
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,708
That'll get you
hard time in the pound, fella.

380
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,629
Attackin' a deputy animal
control officer's vehicle.

381
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:40,093
And a fine modern machine
like this one at that.

382
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,470
Two horsepower,
three miles to the gallon.

383
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,846
Boy, I tell you...

384
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,139
Hey.

385
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,892
You saved my life.

386
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,312
Nobody else here would
have dared to do that.

387
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,314
Wow, did you see that?

388
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,734
-Is it possible?
-Scamp is a canine hurricane!

389
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,362
You did everyone a big favour, 'kay?

390
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,323
Oui, you are practically the hero!

391
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,328
Shouldn't we go after him
or something?

392
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,831
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You got it all wrong, kid.

393
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,542
In the junkyard,
it's every dog for himself.

394
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,336
I can see we're gonna have
to put you to another test.

395
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,673
Anything you say, Buster.

396
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,930
-Will somebody open this thing?
-Okay! Okay! Okay!

397
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,688
-Is that open enough?
-Magnifique, Mooch!

398
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,939
That's using your head!

399
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,108
Thanks again, huh?

400
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,947
You comin', tenderfoot?

401
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,956
I hit the thingy.

402
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,058
This is great! This is living.

403
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,519
I never get to do this at home.

404
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,147
After I pass my next test,

405
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,442
I'm gonna be the best
junkyard dog there ever was!

406
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,569
I don't think so, doll.

407
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,156
You may be good, but you'll
never be as good as the master.

408
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,200
Here we go.

409
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,451
Ruby's right, carnsarnit!

410
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,369
In my day, there was only one stray

411
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,872
by which all dogs was measured.

412
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,624
The Tramp!

413
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,417
Huh? What?

414
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,794
He taught Buster
everything there is to know

415
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,630
about being on the streets, 'kay?

416
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,798
Buster's trouble was Tramp's trouble.

417
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:46,427
And Tramp's trouble
was Buster's trouble, 'kay?

418
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,429
That dog was a prize.

419
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,306
The one that got away.

420
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,391
Got away from me, at least.

421
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,519
Got away with everything!

422
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:58,022
I heard he once stole
an entire meat wagon!

423
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,525
'Kay? Yeah, and then the dogcatcher

424
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,152
chased him all the way to the river.

425
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,532
No, sir. It was dogcatchers.

426
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,617
How many?

427
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,869
At least a dozen.

428
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,749
Two dozen. Now that I think about it,

429
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,002
the police and the army cavalry
were after the boy as well.

430
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,214
He was trapped!

431
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:29,929
But if the Tramp was gonna go,
he was gonna go in style.

432
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,561
So, what happened?

433
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,730
We never saw him again after that.

434
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,027
They say when the wind blows,
you can still hear the Tramp...

435
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:48,864
Wow.

436
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,325
All right, all right.

437
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,452
That is not what happened.

438
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,622
He met this girl, see?

439
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,083
Queen of a kennel club set.

440
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,127
Even her prissy little name

441
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:04,213
still leaves a bad taste in my mouth!

442
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,132
Lady.

443
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,468
But he met his true love.

444
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,429
He betrayed me!

445
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,640
You can't have a family
and still be a junkyard dog!

446
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:18,728
So I gave Tramp a choice.
It's either me or her.

447
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,647
And he picked life on the end of a chain.

448
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:24,525
Hooked up with a real powder puff!

449
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,945
Sleepin' on carpets!
Free room and board!

450
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,865
Livin' the cushy pillow life!

451
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,580
That's when I learned the first rule
about being a junkyard dog...

452
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,333
Buster's trouble is Buster's trouble.

453
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:45,212
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
The Tramp used to scratch like that.

454
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,424
You ain't related, are ya?

455
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,093
-Who, me? No way!
-Good.

456
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,180
'Cause if you were, you'd be kibble.

457
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,685
Right, Buster.

458
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,693
No way, Dad.

459
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,904
That can't be true.

460
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,864
You gave it all up?

461
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,241
I mean, what could be better than this?

462
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,910
You okay, tenderfoot?

463
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,704
Who, me? Yeah. Yeah, sure.

464
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,207
What are you doing out here?

465
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,918
Don't you have
a nice family back home?

466
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,463
What difference does it make?
All families are alike.

467
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,050
They make you take baths
and sleep in a bed,

468
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,511
and you have to eat
everything in your bowl,

469
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,514
and when it rains,
you have to come indoors.

470
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,059
Let's just say you're lucky
you've never had to live with a family.

471
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,144
Wrong again, tenderfoot.

472
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,979
You mean, you had a family?

473
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,732
Actually, I've had five families.

474
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,656
-I always thought one was too many.
-I could never get one to stick.

475
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,742
Someone would take me in,
and just when I'd start to think,

476
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,370
"Wow, this is my family,"

477
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:05,167
they'd move or have a new baby
or have an allergy.

478
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,504
Same old story... I'm out on the street.

479
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,675
Wait a minute.
You really want a family, don't you?

480
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,510
But you've got Buster.

481
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,222
Buster! You can't tell him. You can't!
He'll kick me out.

482
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,516
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

483
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:22,893
I promise.

484
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,396
Thanks.

485
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,110
So, I guess you're Buster's girl, huh?

486
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:35,322
I am not Buster's girl!
I don't belong to anybody.

487
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,117
The junkyard dogs
aren't much of a family,

488
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,952
but what choice do I have?

489
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,871
What more do you need?

490
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,373
As a junkyard dog, you can stay up late

491
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,875
-or dig or...
-Run.

492
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,794
-Yeah. Or play or dig or...
-Run!

493
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,006
-Right. Or chase squirrels...
-No! I mean, run!

494
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,271
Come on!

495
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,985
Angel!

496
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:15,654
Angel! Angel, help!

497
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,199
Now would be a good time! Hurry!

498
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,138
Scamp? Scamp!

499
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,019
Scamp, where are you?

500
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,146
Scamp? Scamp?

501
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,275
Excuse me, I'm looking for...

502
00:35:56,738 --> 00:36:00,032
I think I'm onto somethin'.

503
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,992
Aye? Are you sure?

504
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,164
I most assuredly got him!

505
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,583
-This way!
-Come on, Pidge!

506
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,259
-Oh, look!
-Scamp!

507
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,136
Oh, please.

508
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:29,979
Scamp!

509
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,734
Thank goodness.

510
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:40,197
A wig? You smelled a wig, man!

511
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,032
You're hopeless!

512
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,786
I'm sorry, Miss Lady.

513
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:49,790
Come on. We've gotta keep searching.

514
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,296
I shouldn't have been so hard on him.

515
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,646
-Hey.
-Scamp?

516
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,357
You're all right. I was so worried...

517
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:16,942
So worried?

518
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,988
Yeah, right.
Get over yourself, house pet.

519
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,368
There's gotta be a better way
to take a bath, huh?

520
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,538
Trust me, there is
no good way to take a bath.

521
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,047
Wow! That is so weird.
How'd you do that?

522
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,633
-Talent.
-Let me try.

523
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,890
Oh, that was smooth.

524
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,059
You really are a house dog.

525
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,436
Oh, yeah? Yeah!

526
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:57,608
-You're weird.
-No, you're the weird one.

527
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,235
-Oh, yeah?
-Scamp.

528
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,956
I never had this feeling before

529
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:16,293
She gives me shakes
and shivers I can't ignore

530
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:20,297
And I see that there's more now

531
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,176
Than just running free

532
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,305
I never felt my heart beat so fast

533
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,601
I'm thinking of him first
and of myself last

534
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:37,982
And how happy I want him to be

535
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,279
It's amazing someone in my life

536
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,658
Just might be loving me

537
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:54,665
I didn't know that I could feel this way

538
00:38:56,126 --> 00:39:00,504
It's so crazy something in my life

539
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,217
Is better than a dream

540
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:11,140
I didn't know that I could feel this way

541
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,733
She makes me warm and happy inside

542
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:25,779
He smiles and I
get dizzy and starry-eyed

543
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,033
-All these feelings I have
-All these feelings I have

544
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,702
-Have me asking
-Have me asking

545
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:36,790
Can this be love?

546
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,625
It's crazy

547
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,295
-I can hardly speak
-I can hardly speak

548
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,422
-Whenever he
-Whenever she

549
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,883
-Says hi
-Says hi

550
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,803
I didn't know that I could feel

551
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,308
I never dreamed that I could feel

552
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,853
-I didn't know that I could feel
-I didn't know that I could feel

553
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:01,315
-This
-This

554
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:04,568
-Way
-Way

555
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,312
Nice neighbourhood. Snob Hill.

556
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,773
Hey, Jim Dear never
leaves this gate open.

557
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,733
Come on, Tramp.

558
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,361
Oh, no! We gotta get out of here!

559
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,113
Why? What's wrong?

560
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,203
Come on, boy.
We've done all we can for one day.

561
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,588
Oh, we'll find him.

562
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,591
You were the best street dog
there ever was,

563
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,761
and I still have faith in the old Tramp.

564
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,263
Old Tramp?

565
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,142
If only the old Tramp was still here.

566
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:23,564
Come on, Tramp!
We'll find Scamp tomorrow.

567
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,611
-The Tramp is your father?
-I... Wait, no, wait!

568
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,114
Angel, wait!

569
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,499
Did you find him?

570
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:44,585
Maybe tomorrow.

571
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,673
Scamp.

572
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,009
Bad Scamp.

573
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,323
Gosh, I didn't think
they'd miss me that much.

574
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,575
You didn't think they'd miss you?

575
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:20,037
I can't believe you'd run away
from a home like this.

576
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,540
Well, you don't know what it was like.

577
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,042
No, I don't.

578
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,585
Must have been horrible

579
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,379
having someone care
about you that much.

580
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,049
I need to be wild and free.

581
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,301
I'll never find that here.

582
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,845
I'd give anything to have what you have.

583
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,306
And I'd give anything
to have what you have.

584
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,313
Come on, Scamp.
We could run off together.

585
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,148
We don't need them.

586
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,692
Angel, don't you understand?

587
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:54,404
Only one more test,
and I'll finally be a junkyard dog.

588
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:58,200
-That's where I belong.
-No, you don't belong there.

589
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:02,412
You're better than that, Scamp,
and that's what I like about you.

590
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,879
Come on, tenderfoot, let's go.

591
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:37,864
Wow!

592
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,204
Wow! Look!

593
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,720
I really think we should keep searching.

594
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,179
Nonsense!

595
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,724
It's the Fourth of July!
Time to have some fun.

596
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,560
You can continue
your search after our picnic.

597
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,105
Aunt Sarah, we're not really
in the mood to celebrate.

598
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,817
Oh, come now, Scamp will be all right.
You'll find him.

599
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,986
But, first, let's eat.

600
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,700
I won't have my Fourth of July
ruined by that little Scamp.

601
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,869
There, there, boy.

602
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,467
I knew it. Beautiful.

603
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,762
Scampo, front and centre.
Take a look out there.

604
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,347
See that family?

605
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,600
You mean that family, over there?

606
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,269
No! This family, right here.

607
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,438
Now, as your final test,

608
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,525
I want you to infiltrate their picnic
and liberate their chicken

609
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:59,488
right out from under the nose
of that meek little house dog.

610
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,325
You don't have to prove
anything, Scamp.

611
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,701
Just walk away.

612
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,620
Since when do you care so much?

613
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,705
I thought you were better than this.

614
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,665
Pipe down, Angelcakes!

615
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,918
Come on, kid.

616
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,463
You wanna be wild and free, don't you?

617
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:20,008
All it's gonna cost you
is one juicy chicken.

618
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,470
Yeah. I shoulda known.

619
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:26,056
Once a house dog, always a house dog.

620
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:27,682
I'm no house dog!

621
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:40,987
Scamp back!

622
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:43,740
Oh, my goodness!

623
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,035
-Scamp!
-Monster!

624
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:49,246
Scamp back! Scamp back!

625
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,082
-Scamp wanna play!
-Scamp?

626
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,709
-Come back!
-Where him go?

627
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,586
It's chow time, boys!

628
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:30,954
You...

629
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:34,249
You little mutt! I won't forget you!

630
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,252
I'll lock you in the pound, I swear it!

631
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,682
Slick move. Lost him.

632
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:51,975
-Don't bet on it!
-What?

633
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,980
Hey, slow down there, whirlwind.

634
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,191
I'm not going home! You can't make me.

635
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,651
I know, I know. Easy.

636
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,071
I just want to talk.
So, how you doin' out here?

637
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,656
It's great, Dad.

638
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,909
The junkyard dogs have
taught me all the tricks.

639
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,912
I go wherever I want,
do whatever I please.

640
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,749
-No chains, no fences.
-No regard for someone else's lunch?

641
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,585
That's how it is out here on the streets.

642
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,671
But then, you know
all about that, don't you?

643
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,465
You make the rules, Dad,

644
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,675
but you didn't have to follow them
when you were my age.

645
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,970
Is that why you didn't tell me
you were a street dog?

646
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,389
I didn't want that life for you,

647
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,725
because I found something better.

648
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,143
I found love.

649
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,271
Ain't that beautiful?

650
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,440
I think I'm gettin' all misty-eyed here.

651
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,442
I see you haven't changed a bit.

652
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:46,488
So here we are again,
just like old times,

653
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,908
before you turned
your back on everything

654
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,868
that makes a dog a dog.

655
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,620
He says you walked out on him.

656
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:57,082
After I met your mother,
I guess Buster just got jealous.

657
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,751
-You ditched me!
-I fell in love!

658
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,712
You made your choice!
Now it's his turn to choose.

659
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,214
Come on, kid.

660
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,508
You don't know what
he's really like, Son.

661
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,635
-You're coming home.
-You hear that, kid?

662
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,303
Daddy's tellin' you what to do again.

663
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:11,846
You don't belong here.

664
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:14,766
And he's leading you
back to a life on the chain.

665
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,101
I'm offerin' you freedom.

666
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:17,352
-Scamp.
-Scamp!

667
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,478
-Scamp!
-Scamp!

668
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,897
-Make your choice, kid.
-He doesn't have a choice.

669
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,400
I know what's best for him!

670
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,444
No! You know what's best for you!

671
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:29,573
Well, I'm not you, Dad!

672
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,117
I'm a junkyard dog!

673
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:34,744
That's my boy.

674
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,752
I guess there are some things
you have to learn on your own.

675
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,172
When you've had enough,
our door is always open.

676
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:50,010
House dog to the end.

677
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,761
What'd I tell ya, kid?

678
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,097
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

679
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,935
-Huh?
-Huh?

680
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:08,903
Hey, Scampski!
This is for all you've done, kid.

681
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,373
You did it, kid!
You're at the top of the heap now...

682
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,958
A junkyard dog!

683
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,544
I'm... I'm a junkyard dog.

684
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,630
You made it to the pack!

685
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,965
You're a doll, dollface.

686
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,890
I'm a junkyard dog!

687
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,406
-How could you do that?
-Come on, Angel!

688
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,700
He's your father! Go after him!

689
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:57,577
You're not like the rest of us.

690
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,246
You're good and decent. Kind.

691
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,916
The streets will beat that
out of you if you stay!

692
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,042
But I made it!

693
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,419
This is everything that
I've ever dreamed of.

694
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,422
Dreamed of what? This?

695
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:15,011
You have a home
and a family that loves you.

696
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,180
You're not like the rest of us, Scamp.

697
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,765
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.

698
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:23,770
Let's see,
he's good and decent and kind.

699
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,980
Is that it, Scampy?

700
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,567
You wanna be a widdle house doggie?

701
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:30,694
No!

702
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,822
'Cause you know how I feel
about house dogs.

703
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,281
Hey, cut it out!

704
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,034
She's the one who wants to be
a house dog, not me!

705
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,620
Oh, no. I didn't mean that.

706
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,038
Is that true, Angel baby?

707
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,625
I don't think a family's so bad.

708
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,127
You hear that, boys?

709
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,713
She wants to be a little house pet!

710
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:51,798
Oh, she want to be a little house pet!

711
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:53,174
Gonna wear ribbons.

712
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,468
You ain't no junkyard dog.

713
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,180
That's right, Buster.
I'm not. Not any more.

714
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:03,059
Oh, and... I'm not your girl.

715
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,646
There's going to be trouble!

716
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,400
-Maybe you do belong here.
-Oh, come on.

717
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,402
Where is your sense of humour?

718
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,028
Come on, Angel!

719
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,698
Who needs her?

720
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:18,158
Let her go find some
snivelling little family.

721
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,202
That's where she belongs.

722
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:33,506
Angel?

723
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:40,221
I didn't mean it, Angel!
I don't know what I was thinking!

724
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,474
Really!

725
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,354
Angel, where are you?

726
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:52,901
Just as I suspected,
out looking for Angel.

727
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,198
Beautiful.

728
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,533
Time to settle an old score.

729
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,371
Hold it right there, ya scoundrel!

730
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,801
What the...

731
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:20,595
Well, I'll be!

732
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,889
You're not gettin' away this time!

733
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:29,312
Great. I got everything I ever wanted,

734
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,898
and it stinks.

735
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,485
Come here, ya little hooligan!

736
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,164
Buster!

737
00:52:58,676 --> 00:52:59,926
Gotcha!

738
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,596
Well, lookee here. No collar.

739
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,100
It's a one-way trip to the pound for you.

740
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,445
Oh, man, slick move.
Me without a collar.

741
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,531
How could I be so stupid?

742
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,158
Dad was right.

743
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,536
Buster's nothing but trouble.

744
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,997
I wish I was home.

745
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,633
Always there

746
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,304
To warm you in the winter

747
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:47,891
Always there

748
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:51,311
With shelter from the rain

749
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,314
Always there

750
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,483
To catch you when you're falling

751
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:02,906
Always there to stand you up again

752
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,160
Family

753
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,832
By your side

754
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,877
In seconds if you ask it

755
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,963
Arms out wide

756
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:22,175
To welcome you to stay

757
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:25,094
Near enough

758
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,598
To listen to your heart song

759
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,516
Always there

760
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,186
To help you on your way

761
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:38,191
Family

762
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:41,778
-Family
-Family

763
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:46,199
What is a family?

764
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:52,455
Caring and devoted hearts

765
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:58,544
With endless love to share

766
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:05,426
-Love that will follow you everywhere
-Love that will follow you everywhere

767
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,680
Always there

768
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:11,140
To welcome you in winter

769
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,017
What is a family?

770
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,811
Arms out wide

771
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,063
To welcome you to stay

772
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,231
Right by your side

773
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,441
Near enough

774
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:24,487
-To listen to your heart song
-To listen to your heart song

775
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,364
Always there

776
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,325
To help you on your way

777
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:30,535
Family

778
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,537
Always there

779
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,832
Family

780
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:39,711
-Family
-Family

781
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,682
-Scamp?
-Angel!

782
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:55,601
-Scamp!
-Get out of here! He'll get you, too!

783
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,034
This'll hold ya, you crazy mutt!

784
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,411
Thought you could outfox me, huh?

785
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,662
Well, that'll be the day.

786
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,045
Hey, kid, looks like you got thrown
in the wrong cell!

787
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,216
Hey, Reggie. Long time no see, huh?

788
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,809
Oh, I found you!

789
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,270
You gotta come! Hurry!
Scamp's in trouble!

790
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,731
-Scamp?
-He's in the pound!

791
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,875
-Hold on, Son!
-Dad!

792
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,631
Keep your paws off my boy!

793
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,142
Hey! Paws off my pop!

794
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,709
Oh, yeah! He's cashed in his bones.

795
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:44,836
He's cashed!

796
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,725
Dad?

797
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,817
Dad, you did it!

798
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,610
Slick move!

799
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,281
All right, we have to go now.

800
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,411
You! The one that got away.

801
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:25,084
Let go! Let go! Oh, no!
Oh, have mercy!

802
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:26,919
Oh, let... Oh, let go!

803
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:34,385
Aren't the fireworks lovely tonight?

804
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:38,556
Angel!

805
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,601
Come on, you two.

806
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,227
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What about me?

807
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:45,188
Your old pal, right? Oh, come on!

808
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,106
After I stood by youse
all through that fight?

809
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,317
Hey, come back here
when you're walking away from me!

810
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,532
-Pop?
-Son.

811
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,327
I'm so sorry.

812
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,537
I shouldn't have run away.

813
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,999
Whirlwind.

814
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:08,794
Maybe I was also being
a little too tough on you.

815
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,463
I don't see any harm in the two of us

816
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,131
goin' down to the river once in a while

817
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:14,133
to bay at the moon. What do you say?

818
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,551
Really? You and me?

819
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,137
Your old man's still
got a few good howls

820
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:20,473
-left in him.
-I found him!

821
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,728
I found him for sure this time!

822
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,063
I found him!

823
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:30,566
You found nothing! Again!

824
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:34,612
So far you've found six cats,
three gophers, two rabbits...

825
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,573
-Go easy on him, Uncle Jock.
-No, I'll not go easy on him, Scamp!

826
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:39,700
Five flyin' pigs, a wildebeest!

827
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,160
Scamp?

828
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,539
Why, it is Scamp!

829
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:49,752
Aye, I'll never hear
the end of this one, either.

830
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:54,966
-Ready to go home, whirlwind?
-Not quite, Pop.

831
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:58,094
There's one last thing
I gotta take care of.

832
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,473
Do mine eyes deceive me?

833
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:05,309
Hey, Scamp! Scampadoodle!

834
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,311
You escaped the pound!

835
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,397
Yeah, no thanks to you!

836
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:12,149
Hey, come on. You know our motto.

837
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,610
You can keep your motto!

838
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,780
But not this.

839
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:21,492
I'm going home where I belong.

840
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,913
So long, Buster.

841
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:30,793
Hey, ya missed, Scampalooza! Huh?

842
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,929
-That's my boy!
-Let's go home, Pop.

843
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:45,141
I'll get... Come back here!
You can't leave me here!

844
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:46,726
You're nothin' but a house pet!

845
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:51,022
It's a good look for you, Buster.
The garbage adds some class.

846
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:54,442
Hey. Hey, someone wanna
lend me a paw here?

847
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,485
I think a home sounds nice.

848
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,363
With lots of children
and hugs and kisses!

849
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:03,576
If you dogs leave,
you're never comin' back!

850
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,369
Au revoir, Buster!

851
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:08,289
It has been, as you say, beautiful!

852
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,625
Dogs! You can't leave me here!
I was only kidding.

853
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,961
Buster's trouble ain't Buster's trouble.

854
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:17,214
Come on.
Buster's trouble is everybody's trouble!

855
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,304
What's all the commotion? Scamp?

856
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,723
Hi, Scamp! Scamp come home!

857
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:26,891
He's back!

858
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,936
Hi, Scamp, I love you!

859
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,190
Good job, boy.

860
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,029
Oh, Scamp.

861
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,407
It's so good to have you
back where you belong.

862
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,620
You reek! You need a bath.

863
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,625
But we'll worry about that later.

864
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:02,468
Jim Dear, I think Scamp
brought a friend home.

865
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,596
Hey there, girl. Come on.

866
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,265
Come on, girl. It's okay.

867
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,434
Don't be afraid.

868
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:13,771
Did you help our Scamp
out of those lonely streets?

869
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,654
She's a little angel.

870
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,489
Angel! Angel!

871
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,741
Jim Dear, you don't suppose...

872
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:28,953
Oh, no, Darling.
We've got enough dogs as it is.

873
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,038
You know we can't...

874
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:34,250
No. No. We can't. I...

875
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,628
Oh, what's the use?

876
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,297
Welcome to the family, Angel.

877
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,841
Angel!

878
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,635
In our small, little, not too big

879
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,180
Little, homey, nice, little, quaint, little
Always friendly

880
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:52,226
Old New England town

881
01:02:53,520 --> 01:03:02,278
Welcome

882
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:06,490
Welcome!

883
