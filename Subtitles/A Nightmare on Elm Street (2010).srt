2
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,251
Can I have another?

3
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,422
Hey. Can I have
some more coffee, please?

4
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,425
Where you going?

5
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,471
Excuse me.

6
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,600
Bitch.

7
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:22,451
Hello?

8
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,788
Anyone here?

9
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,147
Lady. Lady.

10
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,151
Hello?

11
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,331
What the fuck?

12
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,193
Dean. Dean.

13
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,198
I told you, if you keep falling asleep,
they're gonna kick you out of here.

14
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,535
Um, sorry. Won't happen again, okay?

15
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,121
Okay.

16
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,744
Nancy.
-Hey, Kris. You can sit wherever you want.

17
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,997
-Actually, l'm just here to meet Dean.
-Oh, he's right over there.

18
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,915
Thanks.

19
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,212
Hey.

20
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,631
Wow, you look like you haven't--

21
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,343
Like I haven't slept in three days?

22
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,266
Dean, what's going on?

23
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,060
So, what are we doing after this?

24
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:56,396
Let me see if we can go
to Ashley's or whatever.

25
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,649
Then I don't know.

26
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,444
Look out, here comes your girlfriend.

27
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,821
-Oh, hey.
-Hi. Can I get you guys anything else?

28
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,492
Uh.... Um....

29
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,289
No, I think we're good.
We'll just get the check.

30
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,628
ls that the only thing
you wanna ask her, Quentin?

31
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,510
Asshole.

32
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,141
Hey.

33
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,811
Why is Kris with Dean?

34
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,317
Okay.

35
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,028
Come on.

36
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,323
That's fucked up.

37
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,493
What was that all about?

38
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,956
Um, Jesse's just--
He's pissed because Kris broke up with him.

39
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,000
-I didn't even know they were together.
-Yeah.

40
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,712
I guess I can keep the change?

41
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,507
Yeah. Look...

42
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,176
...I'm sorry about the mess.

43
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,762
-These guys are just--
-I'm used to it.

44
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,348
So you ever get tired
of working here every weekend?

45
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,017
Do you ever get tired
of coming here every weekend?

46
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,272
Quentin. You coming or no?

47
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:27,404
Sorry. Look, this should
take care of the rest of it.

48
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,866
-See you around.
-See you.

49
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,873
Listen, maybe you should
talk to somebody.

50
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,375
I did.

51
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:45,255
And he thinks all my problems
come from my past.

52
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,674
We began going through my childhood...

53
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,469
...and that's when they started.

54
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,930
When what started?

55
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,891
These nightmares.

56
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,143
Nightmares.

57
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,063
So, what, you can't sleep?

58
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,025
I can sleep.

59
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,569
I just don't want to.

60
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,155
Okay, Dean, listen to me.

61
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,825
They're just dreams.
Okay? They're not real.

62
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,745
These dreams...

63
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,079
...they're real.

64
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,998
They're not.

65
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,752
They're re -- I'm sorry, Kris.

66
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,961
-No, it's okay.
-Kris.

67
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,422
No, no. It's fine.
I'm gonna go clean myself off.

68
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,798
It's okay. It's okay.

69
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,956
You're not real.

70
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,874
You're not real. You're not real!

71
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,126
I am now.

72
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,546
Dean, what are you doing?

73
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,798
You're not real.
-Dean, stop it. Dean.

74
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,426
Dean, stop it!

75
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,975
Dean!

76
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,780
Tragedy can shake us at our core...

77
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,992
...and it can also unite us
in our shared grief.

78
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,745
Today we are gathered and united...

79
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,417
...for the tragic loss of a young man
with so much life ahead of him.

80
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,003
Let us pray.

81
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:53,341
Lord, you who can
turn the shadow of death...

82
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,469
...into the light of a new day...

83
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:00,849
...as we gather to commend Dean
into your hands...

84
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:05,937
...help us to wait upon thee
with penitent hearts...

85
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:11,026
...and remind us of he who died
that we might live.

86
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,713
--and the power and the glory
- forever and ever. Amen.

87
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,300
Amen.
-Come on, sweetie. lt's over.

88
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,469
Yeah.

89
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,565
Let's go say hi.

90
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,943
-Gwen. Hi, how are you?
-Alan, hi.

91
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,531
-lt's been a long time.
-Yeah, yeah.

92
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,951
-- Especially under these circumstances.
- Yeah, not a....

93
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,913
You know, Nance,
if you need someone to talk to....

94
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,207
I'm okay. Thank you.

95
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,501
We're setting up a crisis center
at the school.

96
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,046
-- You know where my office is, right, Nancy?
- Yeah.

97
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,548
We're gonna head out. Take care.
-Good to see you.

98
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,676
Bye-bye, Quentin.

99
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,947
You knew Dean that far back?

100
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,117
Jesus, that is me.
But I don't know how I'm in that picture.

101
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,036
I didn't meet Dean until high school.

102
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,330
Come on.

103
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:55,004
-Dean said something right before he died.
-Oh, please don't.

104
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,174
He said, "You're not real."

105
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,386
He kept repeating it over and over again.

106
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,305
Do you have any idea what that means?

107
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,978
No. I don't.

108
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,816
Think about it. What would it mean?
Dean was on a load of medication when--

109
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,025
Jesse.

110
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,821
When it happened, it was like
somebody was making him do it...

111
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,824
...but there was nobody there.

112
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,329
Jesse, you have to believe me.

113
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:32,625
Kris, it was late and you were scared.
Your mind was just playing tricks on you...

114
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,836
-...that's all.
-I believe you.

115
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,716
You do?

116
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,305
I've seen....

117
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,224
-I saw--
-You didn't see anything.

118
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,312
You weren't right there. Kris was.

119
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,523
She's already fucked up, so leave her alone.

120
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,863
You have no idea what I've seen.

121
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,367
Let's go home.

122
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,617
-Hi.
-Hi.

123
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,456
Hey, Mom, where are all the photos of me
from when I was younger?

124
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,959
-They're not here.
-Oh, well, who knows?

125
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,962
They're probably packed away
over the garage. Why?

126
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,883
Because today at the funeral I, um....

127
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:49,762
I saw a photo of Dean and I
when we were, like, 5.

128
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,142
But, you know, it's funny, l don't remember
knowing Dean before high school.

129
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,644
Who can remember being 5 years old?

130
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,148
Hey, why don't you pack those up?
Dinner's almost ready.

131
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,621
Good night, honey.

132
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,482
Remember me?

133
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,195
Kris? You okay?

134
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,671
What is that?

135
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,423
Uh, nothing.

136
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,175
Just, like, a sketch.

137
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,178
Are you okay?

138
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,182
-Yeah, I'm okay.
-Yeah?

139
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,184
Are you okay?

140
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,479
Yeah, you know.

141
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:32,568
You know, like, if you ever need somebody,
if you ever wanna talk to somebody, l--

142
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,114
I'm sure you have like a thousand
other people you could talk to...

143
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,616
...but if you wanna talk to somebody....

144
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,368
Thanks.

145
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,956
Quentin. You're gonna be late to class.
Come on, buddy, let's go.

146
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,375
-My dad.
-l know.

147
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:55,216
Now, class, it was Pericles
who told the Athenian people...

148
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,885
...they should all gather
into the gates of the city...

149
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,139
...while his naval fleet picked off
the Spartans by sea.

150
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,766
Now, it was to be a slow but sure victory.

151
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:08,271
The Spartans would never make it over
the walls of the acropolis, Pericles said.

152
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:12,817
But what he didn't take into account
is that the plague would eventually strike.

153
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,903
Open your books to page 84.

154
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,240
To further complicate matters...

155
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,535
...the Spartans were armed
with a variety of weapons...

156
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,620
...some of them even improvised.

157
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:28,583
And they would not hesitate to slaughter
every Athenian they saw...

158
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,501
...even children.

159
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,256
Especially the children of soldiers.
This is where the....

160
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,799
Wake up.

161
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,802
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

162
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,434
You really shouldn't fall asleep in class.

163
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,197
Hi, Kris.
-Who are you?

164
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,450
You look just as beautiful...

165
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,119
...as ever.

166
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,668
You have nothing to worry about.

167
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,630
This won't hurt...

168
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,298
...one...

169
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,842
...little...

170
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,052
...bit.

171
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,140
Are you okay, Miss Fowles?

172
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,893
What happened?

173
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,479
I'm sorry.

174
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,113
What?

175
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,462
Kris!

176
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,707
Rufus.

177
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,375
Rufus, what are you doing?

178
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,379
Huh? What are you doing out here?

179
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,756
Come on.

180
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,050
Rufus.

181
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,971
Come on.

182
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,745
Hey.

183
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,081
I have to fly to London on a redeye tonight.

184
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,875
Okay.

185
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,796
You gonna be okay?

186
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,174
Yeah, l'm fine.

187
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,135
I'm gonna be all right. Have a safe flight.

188
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,596
I just worry about you.

189
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,682
-Try and get some sleep.
-Okay.

190
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,602
I'll call you when l land.

191
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,688
I love you.

192
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,523
Love you.

193
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,008
Jesus, Jesse.

194
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,722
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Are you gonna let me in?

195
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,016
Yeah, come in.

196
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,524
All right, l know l've been an asshole...

197
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,777
...and l've been jealous and l've been fucked up.

198
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,864
But Dean was my friend too.

199
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,199
Will you please tell me what's been going on?

200
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,746
I'm having these dreams.

201
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,417
And l'm scared.

202
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,212
I think Dean was having them too.

203
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,554
Kris, listen, we've all--

204
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,806
I know what you're gonna say.

205
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,479
But now every time I dream...

206
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,065
...l always see this man.

207
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,402
And he's....

208
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,740
He's burned...

209
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,411
...and melted. And he's always trying to...

210
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,331
-...attack me with these knives--
-Knives on his fingers.

211
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,044
What?

212
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,671
Oh, my God.

213
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,425
We're having the same dream.

214
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,677
-Kris, it's not possible.
-lt is possible.

215
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,471
-lt's just a dream, all right?
-lt's not a dream.

216
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,765
Shh. Shh.

217
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,601
Shh. Shh.

218
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,311
Oh, God.

219
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,188
I'm so afraid.

220
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,609
All I wanna do is go to sleep,
but if l do he's gonna kill me like Dean.

221
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,614
Maybe we should just
stop talking about it, all right?

222
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:38,285
We keep talking about it, we'll keep thinking
about it, then we'll keep dreaming about it.

223
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,288
Look at me.

224
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,211
You'll stay with me?

225
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,880
Of course I'll stay with you.

226
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,779
Rufus!

227
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,906

228
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,742

Rufus.

231
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,337

232
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,635
Rufus, come here, boy!

233
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,554

-Tell me what happened to Kris, Jesse.
-Someone killed her in her sleep.

283
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,612
What?

284
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,781
-What are you talking about?
-Don't pretend you don't know...

285
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,326
...because you do.
You said it at the funeral.

286
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,370
He's the one who's trying
to kill us in our dreams.

287
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,082
-All l keep hearing is the song.
-What song?

288
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,753
One, two

289
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,006

296
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,026
If you die in your dreams,
you die for real.

297
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,987
Nancy? Who's in there?

305
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,434

Copy that, we've got a homicide.

313
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,960
Code four. Homicide suspect in custody.

314
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,463
Nancy! You know! You know who did it!

00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,828
-Yeah.
-Kris is dead.

326
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,418

327
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,880
-Stay awake.
-Quiet.

328
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,680
Shut the fuck up.

329
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,866
That'll be $24.97.

330
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:17,257
Five, four, three, two....

331
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,978
Five, six, seven....

332
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,509
Nightmares?

333
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,639
Yeah.

334
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,726
Freddy?

335
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,480
Open four.

336
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,193
Get up.

337
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,779
Folks posted your bail.

338
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,064
Jesse, help me.

339
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,193
Help me, please.

340
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,593
Kris?

341
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,268
-Oh, God.
-No.

342
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,771
Just me.

343
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,942
What do you want from me?

344
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,944
Hmm. l don't know, Jesse.

345
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,322
You think you can turn back time?

346
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,949
-Answer me!
-No.

347
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,410
Do you think you can
bring the dead back to life?

348
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,287
-No. No!
-No?

349
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,998
I didn't fucking think so.

350
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,709
No! No! No!

351
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:45,673
Why are you screaming?
I haven't even cut you yet.

352
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,340
I didn't do it! I'm innocent!

353
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,176
Get me out of here!

354
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,179
Let me the fuck out of here!

355
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:40,019
Did you know
that after the heart stops beating...

356
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:43,189
...the brain keeps functioning
for well over seven minutes?

357
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,862
We got six more minutes to play.

358
00:40:56,537 --> 00:41:00,582
-You okay?
-Yeah. I'm just really exhausted.

359
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,378
Here.

360
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,592
-What's that?
-Zoneral.

361
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:16,347
It's basically speed for kids with ADD.
I've been on it since I was, like, 1 5.

362
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,475
No. No. No, thanks.

363
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:22,103
Nancy, look, you're running on fumes.
Here, okay? Are you sure? It's--

364
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,647
Yeah, l'm fine for now.

365
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,573
I didn't take you for the religious type.

366
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,993
Yeah, well, you gotta believe
in something, you know?

367
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,832
What's this one doing here?

368
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,418
It's The Pied Piper of Hamelin.

369
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:49,088
I saw it in one of my dreams. It's about
a guy who's betrayed by a town...

370
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,050
...and he gets his revenge
by taking all their children.

371
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,594
I keep dreaming about children too.

372
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,263
And then there's also a school.

373
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,350
Well, it's gotta mean something.

374
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,562
Yeah, but, l mean, what? We didn't go to
school together until, like, 6th grade.

375
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,316
-Look, we're running out of time.
-What do you mean?

376
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,821
Nightmares are triggered by the belief
that the dreamer has no control...

377
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,490
...and this can cause insomnia.

378
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,117
But then it says at the 70-hour mark...

379
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,703
...the insomniac will begin
to experience micronaps.

380
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:25,124
"His brain will shut down its functions
for seconds in an attempt to recharge."

381
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,878
This basically means that you're dreaming,
but you don't know it.

382
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,714
Like, even if you're awake.

383
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:35,969
And then it says that after that,
your brain will shut down, inducing a coma.

384
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,471
Which is permanent sleep.

385
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:57,407
Nancy?

386
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,537
Nancy.

387
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,601
Yeah?

388
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,857
Hey.

389
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,443
Where have you been?

390
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,737
I was at the bookstore.

391
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,865
Okay, well,
I didn't know where you were.

392
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:43,036
And l just feel like, with everything
that's been happening with your friends--

393
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,746
Hey, Mom?

394
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,665
Do I have some sort of connection
with Kris...

395
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,959
...and Dean and Jesse?

396
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,878
Or Quentin?

397
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:56,174
Like, maybe we went to school together
when we were little or something like that?

398
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,385
Not that l can recall.

399
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,388
Did we ever know a guy named Freddy?

400
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,726
I don't think so.

401
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,108
Okay.

402
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:27,246
Good night.

403
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,767
Hey, it's Gwen.

404
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,354
Nancy's starting to remember.

405
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,334
Honey, you okay?

406
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,503
Yeah, l'm fine, Mom.

407
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:01,215
-All right. I'm going to bed.
-Okay.

408
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,466
Little Nancy.

409
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,053
All grown up.

410
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,138
You're just a nightmare.

411
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,224
That's right.

412
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,602
No one can prove I was ever here.

413
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,688
Who are you?

414
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,277
You don't remember?

415
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,988
You must.

416
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,450
You're my number one.

417
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,788
You're my...

418
00:47:56,707 --> 00:48:00,126
...little Nancy.

419
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,964
I set an alarm.

420
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,133
Yes, you did.

421
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,218
In your dream.

422
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,140
You smell different.

423
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,608
Quentin?

424
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,818
Nancy, he got to him. Jesse's dead.

425
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,321
He died in his sleep.

426
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,323
I saw him.

427
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,160
-l fell asleep. l saw Freddy.
-All right, I'm coming over.

428
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,746
Okay.

429
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,842
Shit.

430
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,186
So Badham's a preschool.

431
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,189
It's on the other end of town.
It was closed years ago.

432
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,733
Can't find any pictures.

433
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,194
Wait, come here.

434
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,823
I drew this after my dream.

435
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:21,040
I don't know. l've never seen it before.

436
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,795
How is the guy in our dreams
connected to the school?

437
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,797
I don't know.

438
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,593
But l know my mom's hiding something.

439
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,394
There's nothing here.

440
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,069
Help me.

441
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,036
What is that?

442
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,263
We're all here.

443
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,432
Kris, Jesse, Dean.

444
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,144
It's me, it's you, it's--

445
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:32,653
What are you doing?

446
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,948
Nancy, what is going on?

447
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:39,118
-Give me the picture.
-l don't understand.

448
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:44,123
You said that....
You said that we didn't know each other.

449
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,126
But we're all in this picture.
We went to school together.

450
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,336
Give me the picture.

451
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,797
-lt's okay.
-Why would you lie to me?

452
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:55,468
-l didn't lie.
-lt's right here. Why would you lie to me?

453
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,137
-Stop lying. You're lying to me.
-l'm not lying to you.

454
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,973
-Stop lying to me!
-l am not lying to you!

455
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,310
I didn't want you to have to go
through your life with this memory!

456
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:08,064
I didn't want you to remember.
I wanted you to forget!

457
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,899
Remember what?

458
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,989
What happened at that preschool?

459
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,618
Smile, everybody.

460
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,661
You guys look great.

461
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:27,833
There was a man at the preschool.

462
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,211
His name was Fred Krueger.

463
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,505
One, two

464
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,590
Freddy's coming for you

465
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,094
Three, four
Better lock your door

466
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,054
He was a gardener.

467
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,183
He lived in the basement
of the preschool...

468
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,520
...and you kids were his life.

469
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,942
Four...

470
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,027
...three...

471
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,529
...two...

472
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,280
...one.

473
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,116
We didn't wanna believe it at first.

474
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,368
Ready or not...

475
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,745
You all were so innocent.

476
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,039
...here l come.

477
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,458
And you, Nancy...

478
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,878
What are you drawing? That is so good.

479
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,505
...you were his favorite of all.

480
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,882
You know what?
I got some other drawings.

481
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,427
And they're, like, really bad drawings.
Maybe you can help me fix them?

482
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,596
And then we started to notice things.

483
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:32,565
Yeah. Uh, he has been acting
a little strange lately.

484
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:36,735
He takes us to the secret cave.

485
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,906
It's okay. It's all right.

486
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,659
So, what did you do?
Did you call the police?

487
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,788
He left town before we ever
were able to confront him.

488
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,000
He's gone. He can't hurt you anymore.

489
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,460
So these dreams that you're having...

490
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,882
...they're repressed memories...

491
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,677
...from a terrible, terrible time.

492
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,638
I hope that you're right.

493
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,311
We have to find the other kids
in the picture.

494
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,480
-What are you talking about? No.
-lt doesn't make any sense.

495
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,692
-There's gotta be more to it. lt's not--
-This makes total sense.

496
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,944
You heard your mom.
These are just memories.

497
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,363
-What if she's wrong?
-We're experiencing them...

498
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,617
-...living them, but they're just memories.
-How do you know that?

499
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,994
Memories don't kill you.

500
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:37,963
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Quentin, get in the car.
-lt's my dad. l gotta go.

501
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,966
-We have to do something.
-Look, stop.

502
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,718
This is crazy. Listen to yourself.

503
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,597
I'm sorry.

504
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:06,450
l want you to do 400 warm-up.
Then do a 200-back-breast drill swim.

505
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,703
Quentin, I need you to focus.
I need you to wake up, get into this.

506
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,789
Let's go. All right, guys.

507
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,500
Step up. Let's go. On the blocks.

508
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,089
Take your mark.

509
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,891
Make sure you're working
your underwaters...

510
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,935
...hit the turns, in and out really quick.

511
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,062
Powerful dolphins off the wall.

512
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:21,734
All right, guys, we're gonna do eight 300s,
descend one to four, hold five to eight.

513
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:25,321
All right, hop out.
On the blocks, guys. Let's go.

514
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,409
Let's step up.

515
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,580
Take your mark.

516
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,129
Come on, pick it up. Let's go. Come on.

517
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,591
Come on. Come on, let's go. Attaboy.

518
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,347
Come on, now. Come on.
Come on, let's go.

519
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,516
Come on.

520
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,935
Come on!

521
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,766
Wait!

522
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:42,815
Hey!

523
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,755
Okay.

524
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,342
- Krueger!
- - Come on out, you bastard!

525
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,063
Goddamn it. You open this door, Krueger!

526
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,356
What do you think I did?

527
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,901
-l didn't do anything!
-Get your ass out. Open the fucking door!

528
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,736
-- l didn't do it!
- Norm, make sure...

529
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,906
-...- he can't get out the back!
- Okay.

530
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,370
Stop!

531
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:41,582
Stop. Okay.

532
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,964
Okay. Okay.

533
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,559
What are you doing? No, no, no.
This isn't the right way.

534
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,978
-We gotta call the police.
-What is the right way?

535
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,190
Our kids get on a stand,
tell a room of people what happened?

536
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,484
-No, we've got to call the police.
-He's right.

537
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,069
-- This is not the way to do this.
- This ends tonight.

538
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,249
Okay. Okay.

539
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,340
This is for my son!

540
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,266
Come out, Krueger!

541
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:12,756
No!

542
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,638
Are you okay?

543
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,976
Go get the nurse.

544
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,979
Breathe, breathe.
Come on. Come on, breathe.

545
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,398
-- Relax and breathe. Come on. Come on.
- l'm okay.

546
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,795
I had another nightmare last night.

547
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:57,342
That burned man with the striped sweater,
he keeps trying to kill me.

548
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,762
I ran a different way this time.
I ended up in front of a preschool.

549
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:05,017
I woke up before l had a chance to explore,
but it has to mean something.

550
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,688
He chased me
into the preschool this time.

551
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,065
I got away,
made it down to the basement.

552
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:15,110
But it feels like that's
where he wants me to go. Like...

553
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,237
...he needs me to find something.

554
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,117
I'm starting to dream
with my eyes open.

555
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,620
I can't tell what's real anymore.

556
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,539
I haven't slept in three days.

557
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:31,585
If I sleep, l dream.

558
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,379
lf I dream, I'm dead.

559
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:39,009
Is there anybody else out there
that this is happening to?

560
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:42,763
Can somebody help me?

561
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:43,972
Please?

562
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:07,829
They're all dead.

563
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,748
I know what happened to Freddy.

564
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,461
You killed Krueger.

565
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,131
-Where'd you hear that name?
-You chased him...

566
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,884
...cornered him and burned him
to death. You hunted him!

567
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,303
We did not hunt him.
We were protecting you.

568
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,972
-From what?
-From him. From what he did to you.

569
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,935
-From what you kids told us he did to you.
-We were 5. We would've said anything!

570
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,355
-Why didn't you go to the police?
-You were so young.

571
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,149
No. God!
And the things we said he did....

572
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:39,444
The cave. Did you ever find it?

573
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,196
No.

574
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,867
How do you know he was guilty?

575
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:49,121
-Oh, my God.
-You killed an innocent man.

576
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,372
Mm-mm.

577
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,126
There's not a day that goes by that
I don't think about that night, Quentin.

578
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,294
Good, you deserve at least that.

579
01:01:56,462 --> 01:02:00,966
Quentin. When you grow up
and you have kids...

580
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,469
...l hope you never know the feeling
of utterly failing to protect them.

581
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,805
-Don't touch-- Don't touch me.
-Son--

582
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,400
You listen to me.

583
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:23,029
As far as everyone around here
is concerned, Fred Krueger never existed.

584
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,493
Quentin.

585
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,371
Quentin, wait. Wait.

586
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,790
-What?
-Slow down.

587
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,542
-Stop.
-We got him killed.

588
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,336
Our stories, our lies.

589
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,672
-What if we can make him stop?
-What if we can?

590
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,967
The preschool. Marcus said that
Freddy wanted him to find something.

591
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,677
Fine.

592
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,514
Nancy.

593
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,570
Don't you wanna hang out, Nancy?

594
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,834
What are you doing?

595
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,506
I just saw Kris in a body bag.

596
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,635
All right, you've been up for too long.

597
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,762
You're having micronaps. We gotta go.

598
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,139
Let's go find the preschool.

599
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,064
What are we doing here?

600
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,441
I need more pills.

601
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,339
Come on. Come on.

602
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:24,317
Hi. Um, l'm gonna need a, um,
refill on that, please.

603
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:27,779
On this, you're out of refills.

604
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:32,117
I'm gonna have to
call the doctor on this.

605
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:35,871
Look, l don't have time
to call a doctor. Look--

606
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,832
Oh, my God.

607
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:00,312
Look, l've been on this stuff
since I was 1 5.

608
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:01,605
Okay? lt's totally fine.

609
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:04,691
You just go back, you fill it up and--
Even just a couple.

610
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,152
-All l need is a couple.
-No. No, I'm sorry.

611
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:28,506
When I want you

612
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,177
In my arms
When I want you

613
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:35,347
Quentin. Quentin.

614
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:38,975
-Just fill it up.
-No.

615
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,439
Dream, dream, dream

616
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,690
Quentin.

617
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:50,028
When I feel blue
In the night

618
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:54,866
And I need you
To hold me tight

619
01:05:55,034 --> 01:06:01,748
Whenever l want you
All l have to do is dream

620
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,159
No. No.

621
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,295
Wake up!

622
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,423
You're bleeding.

623
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:57,595
Oh, my God. What happened?

624
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,599
Hang on.

625
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,436
His sweater.

626
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:05,812
-Okay.
-He's here.

627
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:09,607
Man, you're hurt really bad.

628
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:14,654
Let's go to the hospital. Come on.

629
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,828
Dr. Blake Mason to ICU, please.

630
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,297
Baby.

631
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,717
Oh, honey, honey, honey,
what happened?

632
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,719
Who did this to you?

633
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,637
Look at it, Mom. You know who did it.

634
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:43,850
You know who did it.

635
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,810
Oh, honey.

636
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,358
Dr. Zeger. Dr. William Zeger to CCU.

637
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:56,154
Dr. Zeger. Dr. Zeger to CCU.

638
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,205
Okay, how we doing?

639
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:07,082
It's gonna be okay.

640
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:10,710
I'm gonna give you
a little something for the pain.

641
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,838
-lt'll put you right out.
-lt's okay.

642
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,925
No, Mom, l don't want it.
I don't want it. l don't want it.

643
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,802
-lt's okay, it's okay.
-No, Mom, no.

644
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:22,347
-l don't want it. Don't let her do it.
-This might sting a bit.

645
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,057
-- No! No!
- No, no.

646
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,725
-Okay. Okay.
-No!

647
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:28,686
-Where's Quentin?
-Can l have a word with you in the hall?

648
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,565
Don't leave. Don't leave, Mom. Mom.

649
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:34,526
Where's Quentin? l need Quentin.

650
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:40,156
Your daughter needs to be sedated,
but I can't do anything...

651
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:43,743
-...without your authorization.
-l just want her to be out of pain.

652
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,411
Good. Sign this.

653
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,380
She'll be fine.

654
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,727
Great.

655
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,247
Thank you.

656
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,082
-You okay?
-Yeah.

657
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,293
-Yeah?
-What is that?

658
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:36,921
-Adrenaline. Keep us awake.
-Where'd you get it?

659
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:38,923
I stole it off one of the nurse's carts.

660
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:42,719
You can't take that.
You have no idea what it's gonna do.

661
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:47,432
You know what? That is kind of the least
of my concerns right now. You want some?

662
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:49,267
No.

663
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,315
Whoa.

664
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:57,817
Are you okay?

665
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,489
Yeah. l'm good.

666
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,366
Let's go.

667
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:11,247
- How much further?
- - We're almost there.

668
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,042
Hey, will you talk to me?
I'm falling asleep.

669
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,128
Yeah. What do you wanna talk about?

670
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,174
I don't know.

671
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:22,842
What's your favorite color?

672
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,180
Blue.

673
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:38,191
Look, if you really wanna talk,
how come over the last couple years...

674
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:41,611
...every time I've invited you out,
you've just never shown up?

675
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,990
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I don't exactly fit in.

676
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:53,748
Okay, look,
if we survive the next 24 hours...

677
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,584
...then l'll take you out on a real date.

678
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,423
Well, what if I say no?

679
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:05,718
Well, why don't you sleep on it?

680
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,069
You okay?
-l'm fine.

681
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,780
Come on.

682
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,952
I saw him. He was right there.

683
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,539
We gotta go. Come on.

684
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:50,847
This is it.

685
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:54,225
This is the school.

686
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,926
-- No!
- Heh-heh-heh.

687
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,261
Are you okay?

688
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,266
I don't know what's real anymore.

689
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,310
Come on.

690
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,104
Follow me.

691
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,803
Hey, give me your lighter.

692
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,063
All right, well, now that we're here,
now what?

693
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:25,149
Because I don't remember any of this.

694
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:31,155
This must be his room.

695
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:35,993
Okay, he brought us here for a reason.

696
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,373
This is definitely his room.

697
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:57,348
Quentin.

698
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:13,531
-What?
-There's something back there.

699
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,990
I've been here before.

700
01:14:56,450 --> 01:15:00,244
If you can keep a secret,
I'll take you to a special place.

701
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,187
What are those?

702
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:13,484
What are those pictures of?

703
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,237
They're all of you.

704
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,658
-Let me see.
-No.

705
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:33,337
No.

706
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:38,217
Oh, God.

707
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,803
No.

708
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:45,474
We were wrong.

709
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,520
He's not after us because we lied.

710
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:55,026
He's after us because we told the truth.

711
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:59,530
He brought us here so we would
remember what he did to us.

712
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,575
God. Fuck!

713
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,997
Fuck.

714
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:13,753
What does he want from us?
He's never gonna stop.

715
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:24,930
I know what we need to do.

716
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:27,475
Come on.

717
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:34,732
There's gotta be another way.

718
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,568
If we just sit here and do nothing,
we're gonna die.

719
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,657
-l should do this.
-l'm the one who pulled his sweater out.

720
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:46,035
What if I'm the only one
who can bring him out?

721
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,500
Nancy, I can't let you go to sleep.
You're not gonna wake up.

722
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,002
I know you won't let that happen.

723
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,424
Wake me up if you see me struggle.

724
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,859
Gotta believe in something, right?

725
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:30,746
I'm gonna be here when you get up.

726
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,457
We're gonna make it.

727
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:17,603
Aw, shit.

728
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,672
You can't save her.

729
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,636
Tag.

730
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:53,430
You're it.

731
01:20:57,143 --> 01:20:58,936
Krueger!

732
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:02,439
Your girlfriend's here. l'll be right back.

733
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:09,530
One, two

734
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:13,450
Guess who's coming for you

735
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:19,874
Little Nancy.

736
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:23,127
Now that you caught me,
what game do you wanna play next?

737
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:26,213
-Fuck you.
-Ooh. Sounds like fun.

738
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:28,632
It's a little fast for me.

739
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,803
How about we hang first?

740
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:38,767
No. It's not real.

741
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,480
It's real.

742
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,901
I'm real.

743
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:49,588
Boo.

744
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:14,446
Now, how's this for a wet dream?

745
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:02,453
Quentin, wake me up.

746
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:06,707
This dress...

747
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:10,961
...was always one of my favorites.

748
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:15,049
Do you remember it, Nancy?

749
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:18,302
Of course you do.

750
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:22,890
You remember everything now,
don't you?

751
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:27,853
Your memories are what fuels me.

752
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:31,690
No. Please don't.

753
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:36,153
Your mouth says no...

754
01:24:36,529 --> 01:24:39,656
...but your body says yes.

755
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:41,825
Mmm.

756
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,702
Don't turn away.

757
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,079
Look at me!

758
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:50,250
Look what you did to me.

759
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:59,051
Now it's time to play.

760
01:25:09,562 --> 01:25:11,438
Are you having fun?

761
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,739
Naughty girl.

762
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:28,122
You can't hurt me.

763
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:30,958
You're in my world.

764
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:35,754
And you can't ever leave.

765
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,016
Ohh....

766
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:51,728
That's music to my ears.

767
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:54,565
I wanna wake up!

768
01:25:54,732 --> 01:25:56,316
You can't wake up.

769
01:25:56,484 --> 01:26:01,572
I had to keep you awake long enough
so when you finally slept...

770
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,576
...you'd never wake up again.

771
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:09,663
Nancy, wake up.

772
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,415
Wake up, Nancy, wake up!

773
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:14,251
We're gonna be in here a long time.

774
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,088
-Nancy, please!
-Did you really think your boyfriend...

775
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:21,091
-...could wake you up?
-Please, don't do this!

776
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,010
Please!

777
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,429
I'm your boyfriend now.

778
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,933
Nancy, come back! Please, wake up!

779
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:31,602
You promised!

780
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:45,157
Sweet dreams.

781
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,130
Quentin, get him.

782
01:27:14,145 --> 01:27:17,397
Die! Fucking bastard!

783
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:24,154
Nice try, Nancy.

784
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,989
Now let me take a stab.

785
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:42,673
Now, why don't you just fucking die?

786
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:52,015
It hurts, doesn't it?

787
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:54,268
That's because you're
in my world now, bitch.

788
01:28:27,885 --> 01:28:29,469
Wait.

789
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:09,634
- Give me some slack.
- - Yeah, aim it up a little higher.

790
01:29:11,262 --> 01:29:12,596
No sign of a body anywhere.

791
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:40,123
Hey, Quentin.

792
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:45,462
Nightmare's over.

793
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,906
I want you to go
straight up to bed, okay?

794
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,616
Yeah.

795
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,205
Hey, Mom?

796
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:25,210
I know you were just trying
to protect me. Thank you.

797
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:28,713
I'm just glad you're safe.
