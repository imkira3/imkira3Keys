who can plug us into
the social pipeline.

322

No! No no no!
No, Lloyd!

323
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:57,570
No! I say we stay here,
we hunt for jobs,

324
00:17:57,608 --> 00:18:00,202
and we keep saving our money
for the worm store!

328
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,379
You know what I'm sick
and tired of, Harry?

329
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:14,884
I'm sick and tired of having to
eke my way through life.

330
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:21,458
I'm sick and tired
of being a nobody.

332

Okay okay,

Have a good cry.

Lloyd,
what are you doing?

356
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:49,580
It feels like you're running
at an incredible rate, Harry.

357
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,747
Would you quit it?
We're not even through Connecticut yet,

358
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:52,983
and already
you're annoying me.

359
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:55,515
- Sorry.
- Jeez.

00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,757
<i>- We're really doing it, aren't we?
- Yeah.</i>

Hey, where'd
you get those?

362
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:04,868
I bought them
when we filled up.

363
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:06,927
Well... (stutters)
We're supposed to talk

364
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:08,734
about all
expenditures, Lloyd.

365
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,604
We're on a very
tight budget.

366
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:12,871
This didn't come out
of our travel fund.

367
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,377
Oh.

368
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:16,312
No, I was able to raise
25 extra bucks

369
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:18,713
before we left.

370
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,979
Where did you get
25 extra bucks?

371
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:24,249
I sold some stuff
to Billy in 4C.

373

Yeah!

374
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:30,554
Yeah.

375
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:33,029
What did you
sell him, Lloyd?

376
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:36,395
Stuff.

377
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:39,892
- What kind of stuff?
- I don't know.

378
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:42,030
A few baseball cards,
a sack of marbles...

379
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:44,234
(coughs)
Petey.

380
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,744
Petey?

381
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:50,679
You sold my dead bird
to a blind kid?

382
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:53,878
Lloyd, that-that...
what are you...

383
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:56,409
Petey didn't even
have a head!

384
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:59,787
Harry,
I took care of it.

385
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,528
Pretty bird.

386
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:06,359
Yeah. Can you say,
"pretty bird"?

387
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:07,955
Pretty bird.

388
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:10,627
Yes, pretty bird.

389
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:12,761
Pretty bird.

390
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:18,098
Polly want a cracker?

391
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:23,439
Those rat bastards.

392
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:25,608
They're rubbing it
right in our faces.

393

a goddamn hemorrhage

that briefcase back.

395
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,545
They must have been
following us for weeks.

396
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:34,786
- Why you say?
- "Gas Man."

397
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:37,487
How the hell do
they know that I got gas?

398
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:39,621
They gotta be pros.

399
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:43,762
Don't worry.
We're going to get that money back.

400
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:47,463
And I'll tell you
something else,

401
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:49,496
they ain't never
getting to Aspen.

402
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,804

<i>Lloyd:

405
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:03,883
Yeah, I know.

Flo, like the TV show.

Uh... what is
the "soup du jour"?

410
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:24,368
It's the soup of the day.

411
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:26,069
Mm-hmm...

412
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,237
That sounds good.
I'll have that.

413
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:31,811
Anything else
before I leave the area?

414
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:33,612
No... yeah...

00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,516
yes yes,
my soda's flat.

416
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:37,851
It doesn't have
any bubbles.

417
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:46,825
Happy now?

418
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:53,866
Feels good to mingle
with these laid-back country folk,

419
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:57,965
don't it, Harr?
I like it a lot.

420
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:02,671
- Uh-oh.
- What? What's the matter?

421

(blows)

422
00:23:05,783 --> 00:23:08,513
You spilled the salt,
that's what's the matter.

423
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:11,578
Spilling the salt
is very bad luck.

424

We're driving
across the country.

425

The last thing we need
is bad luck.

426
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:19,385
Quick. Toss some salt
over your right shoulder.

into picking up his tab,

No, in the movie, they catch up to him
a half-mile down the road

You want me

00:35:35,665 --> 00:35:38,133
No, I'm cool.

Get her!

This is the life...

647
00:36:26,283 --> 00:36:29,150
cold beer, a hot tub
and paper-thin walls.

(laughs)

649
00:36:31,888 --> 00:36:34,857
There's only one thing that could make this
moment any better.

650
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:36,552
What's that?

651
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:38,493
If you had a nice set
of knockers.

652
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,326
(laughs)
That's two things, Lloyd.

653
00:36:41,364 --> 00:36:44,299
Yeah, well, it's a good thing you're not
stacked, Harry,

654
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:45,801
or I'd be banging you
right now.

656
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:49,864
I'd show you what
a real man can do.

657
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:53,501
Split you like an
old piece of firewood.

658
00:36:56,646 --> 00:36:59,479
You'd probably like it too,
you big homo.

659
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:01,211
Shut up.

660

662
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:15,526
I don't know, Lloyd.
You know,

663
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:17,396
this place doesn't
really do it for me.

666
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:25,899
It was a few years ago.

667
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:28,706
What happened, Harry?
Some little filly break your heart?

668
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:30,337
No, it was a girl.

669
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,870
- Oh.
- Fraida Felcher.

670
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:34,281
Yeah, we stayed in a place
just like this.

671
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:36,717
Wasn't this classy,
but, you know, nice.

672
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:39,654
Felcher?
From Cranston?

673
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:40,986
Yeah.
You know her?

674
00:37:41,024 --> 00:37:42,821
Oh, yeah!

675
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:45,384
I mean,
I remember you...

676
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:47,794
talking about her.

677
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:52,268
We had the most incredibly
romantic time.

678
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:54,395
I thought we were gonna be
together forever,

679
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,735
and then about a week later,
right out of the blue,

680
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:58,434
she sends me
a John Deere letter.

681
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:01,569
- She give you any reason?
- Yeah, I called her up.

682
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:03,306
She gave me
a bunch of crap

683
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:05,678
about me not listening to her
enough or something.

684
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:07,615
I don't know.
I wasn't really paying attention.

685
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:09,585
But the thing
that hurt the most

686
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:12,247
is I think she was
seeing another guy.

687
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:18,857
Never did
find out who.

we just happened upon?</i>

690
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:47,547

- Man: I had plans.</i>

691
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,455
<i>- Things I wanted to do.
- Yeah.</i>

692
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:51,517
This is where it all ends...
at a phone booth.

693
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:53,392
- (man muttering)
- Yeah. The boys are holed up

694
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,295
in a little love-nest
for the night.

695
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:58,028
I think they're
a little bit strange.

696
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:00,662
What the hell are
these guys up to?

697
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:02,934
I mean, is it possible
that they could be feds?

698
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:05,600
Highly unlikely
from what I've seen.

699
00:39:05,642 --> 00:39:07,633
Sir, did you
ever hear

700
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:10,612
of the concept
of other people?

701
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:14,640
Um... me being that
for the phone,

702
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:15,946
sir.

703
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:18,681
Oh, you turned
your back on me.

704
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:21,088
Ho ho ho!
He got me mad. I almost like it.

705
00:39:21,124 --> 00:39:23,319
You and Shay were
supposed to grab that bag

706
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,487
- so we could end this shit!
- Here's your drink, baby.

707
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:28,964
Do you know the damage
I could do to you?

708
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:32,593
Hold on a minute.

709
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:34,728
Hmm.

710
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:36,500
But that's not
your problem.

711
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:38,473
You didn't know.

712
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:41,204
Get off
the phone.

713
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,708
Get off the pho...

714
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:51,984
I'm sorry, Mr. Andre.
You were saying?

715
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:53,955
Look, Mental,

716
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,652
these jokers have got a lot of money
and it belongs to me!

717
00:39:56,693 --> 00:39:59,594
Now, I want to know who they are
and what they're doing with it!

718
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:02,826
Hey hey hey, I told you already.
I'm on it.

719
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:06,063
- All right?
- Good.

we've only gone
about four inches.

we have enough
gas money.

725
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:19,470
Relax. We have
more than enough.

726
00:40:19,516 --> 00:40:21,484
I think
you're wrong, Lloyd.

727
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:22,815
How much
you wanna bet?

728
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:24,513
I don't bet.

729
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:25,987
What do you mean,
you don't bet?

730
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:27,717
I mean I don't bet.
I don't gamble.

Pussy pussy pussy!

732
00:40:29,826 --> 00:40:32,852
- I never have, and I never will.
- Yeah, right!

733
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:35,626
I'll bet you 20 bucks
I can get you gambling

734
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:37,758
- before the end of the day.
- No way.

735
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:39,462
- I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.
- Nope.

- Oh, yeah.

but I'm going to get you.

742
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:56,144
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Nuh-uh.

743
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:57,949
Come on, Joe.
Let me do them.

744
00:40:57,987 --> 00:40:59,784
Let me do
both of them.

to worry about it.

Just shut up!

747
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:05,119
Now, we don't even know
who the hell they are.

748
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:07,152
You don't kill people
you don't know.

749

That's a rule.

you follow us. You got that?

- Cannot. Stamped it.

Can too. Double-stamped it.
No erasies.

Cannot. Triple-stamped it.

00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:47,997
Radio?

778

We borrow a few bucks...
just a small loan from the briefcase

1147
01:04:35,337 --> 01:04:38,363
- and we find some reasonable lodgings.
- Good plan.

1148
01:04:38,406 --> 01:04:41,102
And we'll keep track of all the money
we spend with IOUs.

We'll be meticulous,

- Absolutely.

on that hosehound.

1254
01:10:22,817 --> 01:10:25,285
I'd like to eat her liver with
some fava beans

1255
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,288
<i>and a nice
bottle of Chianti.</i>

1256
01:10:27,322 --> 01:10:29,654
(both mimic
Hannibal Lecter)

1257
01:10:29,691 --> 01:10:32,524
Come on, let's go get a couple bowls
of loudmouth soup.

1258
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,289
Yeah.

1259
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:36,422
Hey, bartender,

1260
01:10:36,464 --> 01:10:38,659
- two martinis, please.
- Yes, sir. Right away.

1261
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,669
<i>Nicholas: Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?</i>

1262
01:10:41,703 --> 01:10:43,796
The Aspen
Preservation Society

1263
01:10:43,838 --> 01:10:45,863
is the world's
foremost defender

1264
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:48,899
of 23 endangered
species,

1265
01:10:48,943 --> 01:10:51,434
and it is with
tremendous honor

1266
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:54,243
that we're able to bring
Mr. Swanson forward

1267
01:10:54,282 --> 01:10:56,648
to introduce us
to the 24th. Everybody...

1268
01:10:56,684 --> 01:10:58,618
Karl.

1269
01:10:58,653 --> 01:11:00,814
Thank you, Nick.

1270
01:11:02,857 --> 01:11:04,791
Thank you.

1271
01:11:04,826 --> 01:11:06,623
Ladies and gentlemen,

1272
01:11:06,661 --> 01:11:09,653
I give you
the Icelandic snow owl.

1273
01:11:09,697 --> 01:11:13,463
<i>(drum roll)</i>

1274
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:14,695
<i>(cymbals crash)</i>

1275
01:11:14,736 --> 01:11:17,296
(applause)

1276
01:11:17,338 --> 01:11:20,796
These magnificent specimens
constitute one seventh

1277
01:11:20,842 --> 01:11:23,675
of the snow owl population
left on the planet.

1278
01:11:23,711 --> 01:11:26,646
And God willing,
with your help

1279
01:11:26,681 --> 01:11:28,740
and that of
the Society's,

1280
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:31,946
these wonderful creatures
will flourish once more.

1281
01:11:31,986 --> 01:11:35,183
<i>Thank you again
and enjoy your evening.</i>

1282
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:40,022
Can I have
some pistachios, please?

1283
01:11:41,963 --> 01:11:43,828
And another one
of those.

1284
01:11:43,865 --> 01:11:46,265
Lloyd, what are you doing?
Would you calm down?

1285
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:48,769
I've never seen you
so nervous.

1286
01:11:48,803 --> 01:11:52,534
Keep an eye on 'em, Shay.
Keep a close eye.

1287
01:11:52,573 --> 01:11:54,734
I'm ready for
a commitment, Harry.

1288
01:11:54,776 --> 01:11:57,609
The first time
I set eyes on Mary Swanson,

1289
01:11:57,645 --> 01:12:01,308
I just got that old-fashioned
romantic feeling

1290
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:03,613
where I'd do anything
to bone her.

1291
01:12:03,651 --> 01:12:05,744
That's a special
feeling, Lloyd.

1292
01:12:05,787 --> 01:12:07,778
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1293
01:12:07,822 --> 01:12:10,882
<i>Oh my,
there she is.</i>

1294
01:12:10,925 --> 01:12:13,291
Wow! You weren't
kidding, Lloyd.

1295
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:15,990
She's an angel!
(whistles)

1296
01:12:16,998 --> 01:12:18,761
Well, what are
you waiting for?

1297
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,633
Get over there
and talk to her.

1298
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:27,805
She's just going to think
I'm some kind of a psycho

1299
01:12:27,842 --> 01:12:30,072
when she finds out
how far I came just to see her!

1300
01:12:30,111 --> 01:12:31,976
You know what you have?!
Her briefcase!

1301
01:12:32,013 --> 01:12:35,005
She's gonna be
thrilled to see you.

1302
01:12:35,049 --> 01:12:38,348
<i>Wait.
I have an idea.</i>

1303
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:41,952
<i>Why don't you go over</i>

1304
01:12:41,989 --> 01:12:43,923
and introduce yourself?

1305
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,926
And that way,
you can build me up

1306
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,928
so I won't have to
brag about myself later.

1307
01:12:47,962 --> 01:12:49,896
Tell her I'm rich

1308
01:12:49,931 --> 01:12:52,399
and, uh,
I'm good-looking

1309
01:12:52,433 --> 01:12:54,458
and, uh, I have
a rapist wit.

1310
01:12:54,502 --> 01:12:56,561
No, I don't know.
I don't think I could... no.

1311
01:12:56,604 --> 01:12:59,368
- Come on, please.
- No, I'm not...

1312
01:12:59,407 --> 01:13:02,501
- Please! Please!
- Okay okay okay. Stop.

1313
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:04,443
What are you gonna do?

1314
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:06,743
I'm going to
hang by the bar,

1315
01:13:06,781 --> 01:13:10,148
- put out the vibe.
- Okay.

1316
01:13:20,828 --> 01:13:23,228
Nice set of hooters
you got there.

1317
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:28,798
- I beg your pardon?
- The owls, they're beautiful.

1318
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:32,503
Oh.

1319
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,508
Yeah.

1320
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:36,476
Are you
a bird lover?

1321
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,002
Me? Oh, no.
Well, I used to have a parakeet...

1322
01:13:39,046 --> 01:13:41,947
- Ah.
...but now my main area of expertise

1323
01:13:41,983 --> 01:13:44,474
is, uh, canines...

1324
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:46,646
"dogs"
to the layperson.

1325
01:13:47,655 --> 01:13:49,850
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

1326
01:13:50,858 --> 01:13:53,827
- I love dogs too.
- Oh.

1327
01:13:53,861 --> 01:13:56,125
- So how are you involved with them?
- Oh, you know,

1328
01:13:56,164 --> 01:13:59,133
I've trained them, bathed them,
clipped them.

1329
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:00,930
- I've even bred them.
- Oh, really?

1330
01:14:00,968 --> 01:14:02,936
- Any unusual breeding?
- No.

1331
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:05,029
Mostly just doggy-style.

1332
01:14:05,072 --> 01:14:08,405
One time,
we successfully mated

1333
01:14:08,443 --> 01:14:10,809
a bulldog
with a shih-tzu.

1334
01:14:10,845 --> 01:14:13,746
Really?
That's weird.

1335
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:16,409
Yeah. We...
we called it a bullshit.

1336
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:18,180
(laughing hysterically)

1337
01:14:27,562 --> 01:14:29,860
Oh, I'm... anyway,
the real reason

1338
01:14:29,897 --> 01:14:32,058
<i>I came over here
was to...</i>

1339
01:14:32,099 --> 01:14:35,034
<i>I've got to introduce you
to a buddy of mine.</i>

1340
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:38,527
- I don't believe I've met your friend.
- Oh.

1341
01:14:38,573 --> 01:14:41,064
Well, actually, we haven't been
properly introduced.

1342
01:14:41,108 --> 01:14:43,872
- My name is Mary Swanson.
- Hi, Harry Dunne.

1343
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:46,641
Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is my stepmother Helen.

1344
01:14:46,681 --> 01:14:48,945
Hi. Harry Dunne.
Pleasure to meet you both.

1345
01:14:48,983 --> 01:14:51,178
Mm-hmm. Well,
I saw you come in.

1346
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:53,517
I was hoping I'd get
a chance to meet you.

1347
01:14:53,554 --> 01:14:57,752
- You were? Really?
- Yes! That tuxedo, it's fabulous!

1348
01:14:57,792 --> 01:15:00,590
Really. I love a man
with a sense of humor,

1349
01:15:00,628 --> 01:15:03,495
and so does Mary.
It's hysterical!

1350
01:15:03,531 --> 01:15:05,089
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

1351
01:15:05,132 --> 01:15:08,124
<i>Oh. Anyway, um,
about my friend...</i>

1352
01:15:08,169 --> 01:15:11,502
What are you doing tomorrow?
I believe that Mary

1353
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:13,200
is looking for someone
to hit the slopes with.

1354
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:14,970
She... what? Huh?

1355
01:15:15,009 --> 01:15:17,944
Helen, you're
embarrassing me.

1356
01:15:17,979 --> 01:15:19,947
Well, you are.
I mean, after all,

1357
01:15:19,981 --> 01:15:22,108
the snow's going to be gone
in a couple of weeks.

1358
01:15:22,149 --> 01:15:24,014
And, well, this may be
your last chance.

1359
01:15:24,051 --> 01:15:26,144
Poor thing, she never
gets a chance to get out.

1360
01:15:26,187 --> 01:15:28,849
Well, what do you say, Mr. Dunne?
Are you available?

1361
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:31,188
Well, I don't know.
See, my friend...

1362
01:15:31,225 --> 01:15:33,090
Oh, forget your friend
for one day.

1363
01:15:33,127 --> 01:15:36,221
I think you kids'll have
a wonderful time. What do you say?

1364
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:38,494
Well, you know,
I don't know, you know.

1365
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:40,967
You know, the thing...
part of... sure.

1366
01:15:41,002 --> 01:15:44,130
What time?
Ahem...

1367
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:50,033
How come you didn't
bring her over?

1368
01:15:50,077 --> 01:15:52,045
Relax.
You're golden.

1369
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:54,513
- I got you a date with her tomorrow.
- Oh.

1370
01:15:56,117 --> 01:15:58,551
- (stammers) What... I... this...
- Yeah.

1371
01:15:58,586 --> 01:16:00,850
- I love you, man.
- Okay okay.

1372
01:16:00,888 --> 01:16:02,719
- You're kissing me.
- I love you.

1373
01:16:02,757 --> 01:16:05,225
- I love you!
- You're kissing me. Lloyd!

1374
01:16:07,628 --> 01:16:10,256
This calls for
a little of the bubbly!

1375
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:12,528
- You're going to be my best man, Harr.
- Oh, good.

1376
01:16:12,567 --> 01:16:14,125
- I promise.
- Thank you.

1377
01:16:14,168 --> 01:16:16,136
You have just
earned yourself a seat

1378
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:20,129
at the head table, pal.
And we already got the tuxes.

1379
01:16:21,342 --> 01:16:23,276
<i>- (loud thud)
- (owl squawks)</i>

1380
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:29,313
<i>- Woman: Gracious sakes!
- (crowd murmuring)</i>

1381
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:33,013
<i>- Man: Good grief!
- Boy, this party really died.</i>

1382
01:16:40,124 --> 01:16:42,615
Hey, maybe it was
a coincidence.

1383
01:16:42,659 --> 01:16:45,184
(mimics)
Hey, maybe it was a coincidence.

1384
01:16:45,229 --> 01:16:48,687
It was a message, Shay,
pure and simple.

1385
01:16:48,732 --> 01:16:50,927
I mean, we killed
their bird.

1386
01:16:50,968 --> 01:16:53,994
Now they killed
one of ours.

1387
01:16:55,939 --> 01:16:57,998
How could anybody
whack a bird with a cork?

1388
01:16:58,041 --> 01:17:00,339
These guys aren't
just anybody.

1389
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:03,437
They're good.

1390
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:11,651
Mary Christmas.

1391
01:17:11,688 --> 01:17:14,452
Mrs. Mary Christmas.

1392
01:17:16,026 --> 01:17:19,427
- Kinda catchy, huh, Harr?
- Yeah yeah, that sounds nice.

1393
01:17:19,463 --> 01:17:22,864
But, Lloyd, don't you think you might be
jumping the gun a little bit?

1394
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,834
I mean, you know,
who knows?

1395
01:17:24,868 --> 01:17:26,733
You know, maybe,
once you get to know her

1396
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:29,102
you'll find out
that she's not your type.

1397
01:17:31,175 --> 01:17:32,938
Hey!

1398
01:17:32,976 --> 01:17:36,139
Don't you ever
say that again!

1399
01:17:37,214 --> 01:17:39,205
She is the love
of my life!

1400
01:17:39,249 --> 01:17:41,683
The blood in my veins!

1401
01:17:41,718 --> 01:17:43,413
<i>We belong together...</i>

1402
01:17:43,453 --> 01:17:45,751
till the mountains
fall into the sea,

1403
01:17:45,789 --> 01:17:47,689
till the heavens
collide!

1404
01:17:47,724 --> 01:17:50,318
Or until I get sick of her
and need to move on.

1405
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,796
- You hear me?!
- Okay okay okay okay. Just calm down.

1406
01:17:53,831 --> 01:17:55,696
Just calm down.

1407
01:17:55,732 --> 01:17:58,223
(panting)
Okay.

1408
01:17:58,268 --> 01:18:01,328
Now...

1409
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:03,839
let me
get this straight.

Lobby bar
in the lobby.

1411
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:08,873
Yeah, and that's
what she said.

1412
01:18:08,912 --> 01:18:11,142
She'll meet you there
at 10:00 sharp.

1413
01:18:12,216 --> 01:18:14,343
- Okay.
- Okay.

1414
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,150
Where're you going
in that get-up?

1415
01:18:20,824 --> 01:18:22,815
Oh. I... you know, I just thought,
you know,

1416
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:24,953
when you'd be off making
your love connection

1417
01:18:24,995 --> 01:18:27,293
I'd be out trying my luck
on the slopes.

1418
01:18:27,331 --> 01:18:29,299
You mean you're gonna
go out in public

1419
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:31,324
dressed in tights?

1420
01:18:31,368 --> 01:18:33,302
Oh no, these aren't
tights, Lloyd.

1421
01:18:33,337 --> 01:18:35,805
These are fashionable
Euro-trash ski trousers.

1422
01:18:35,839 --> 01:18:38,137
Pretty revealing.

1423
01:18:39,142 --> 01:18:40,439
Really?

1424
01:18:40,477 --> 01:18:42,502
Yeah, but it's
just a tiny lump.

1425
01:18:42,546 --> 01:18:44,946
No one'll notice.

1426
01:18:44,982 --> 01:18:47,542
You're right.
I can't go out dressed like this.

It's a beautiful day,

Yes yes, I've had a wonderful time
so far. Thank you.

God, it feels

I haven't been outside that much
in the last couple weeks.

1456
01:20:20,577 --> 01:20:23,011
Oh, yeah?
Why not?

1457
01:20:23,046 --> 01:20:26,914
Um, there's been
some family problems,

1458
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:29,919
but I don't want
to bore you with those.

1459

Thanks.

I do this all the time.

Say, kids,

1467
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:08,890
you wouldn't
happen to have

1468
01:21:08,925 --> 01:21:11,018
a cup of warm water,
would you?

1469
01:21:11,061 --> 01:21:13,689

Yuck.

1470
01:21:17,434 --> 01:21:19,402
Excuse me.

1471
01:21:19,436 --> 01:21:21,631
Is it 10:00 A.M. Yet?

1472
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:24,800
It's 1:00.

1473
01:21:27,477 --> 01:21:31,607
That's what I have too.
Thought maybe it was fast.

1474
01:21:34,618 --> 01:21:37,314
She's running late,
huh?

1475
01:21:37,354 --> 01:21:40,619
Just a couple hours.
You know girls.

1476
01:21:40,657 --> 01:21:43,353
When they're excited
about something,

1477

be perfect.

My God! You poor guy.
Does it hurt?

1489

Let me help you.

1492
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:49,691
No no no no no.

1493
01:22:49,726 --> 01:22:52,058

Anyway, enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

Yeah?

1528

You wouldn't happen to know
a Mary Swanson, would you?

Mary Swanson? Yeah.

supposed to mean?

you know where
she lives?

1536
01:25:37,627 --> 01:25:41,654
Yeah, her family has the big place
up on Alpine Drive.

1537
01:25:41,698 --> 01:25:44,826
Alpine Drive?
Big place?

01:26:09,726 --> 01:26:12,354
today was just what I needed.
Thanks a lot, Harry.

Mary.

So you'll pick me up
tonight at 7:45?

01:26:20,737 --> 01:26:22,568
Well, no, I've got

(laughs)
Stop it!

1550
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,874
Okay 7:45.

1552
01:27:21,564 --> 01:27:23,555
Doesn't make
any sense, Lloyd.

1553
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,363
She told me
10:00 sharp!

1554
01:27:25,402 --> 01:27:27,734
Are you sure you went
to the right bar?

1555
01:27:27,771 --> 01:27:31,639
Oh, yeah. Yep.

Why would she have you meet her
at a bar at 10:00 in the morning?

Because you're

1711
01:38:12,548 --> 01:38:14,948
What are my chances?

1712
01:38:14,984 --> 01:38:17,509
Not good.

1713
01:38:21,490 --> 01:38:25,984
You mean not good,
like one out of 100?

1714
01:38:26,028 --> 01:38:30,397
I'd say more like
one out of a million.

1715
01:38:35,704 --> 01:38:39,572
So you're telling me
there's a chance!

1716
01:38:41,710 --> 01:38:43,803
Yeah!

1717
01:38:45,414 --> 01:38:47,382
I read you.

1718
01:38:47,416 --> 01:38:49,441
<i>(knocks)</i>

1719
01:38:54,423 --> 01:38:57,392
Hi. We have plenty
of towels. Thanks.

1720
01:38:57,426 --> 01:39:00,259
Nicholas!
What are you doing here?

1721
01:39:00,296 --> 01:39:01,991
I've been looking
for you, Mary.

1722
01:39:02,031 --> 01:39:04,022
I have some news
about your husband.

1723
01:39:05,267 --> 01:39:08,634
Husband?!
Wait a minute!

1724
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:14,005
What was all that
one-in-a-million talk?

1725
01:39:14,043 --> 01:39:16,841
Aren't you going to
invite me in?

1726
01:39:21,817 --> 01:39:25,514
<i>Beth: Hey, Harry,
you never called!</i>

1727
01:39:25,554 --> 01:39:27,488
What are you doing here?

1728
01:39:31,494 --> 01:39:34,588
Excuse me, gunman,
who are you?

1729
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:36,655
Don't play dumb
with me, asshole!

1730
01:39:36,699 --> 01:39:39,566
I'm the rightful owner of that briefcase
you've been carrying around!

1731
01:39:39,602 --> 01:39:41,729
Oh. Well, then...

1732
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:45,797
Nicholas, my family
trusted you.

1733
01:39:45,841 --> 01:39:48,036
Shut up!

1734
01:39:48,077 --> 01:39:52,070
Listen, Mr. Samsonite,
about the briefcase...

1735
01:39:52,114 --> 01:39:54,139
my friend Harry and I
have every intention

1736
01:39:54,183 --> 01:39:56,743
- of fully reimbursing you.
- What?

1737
01:39:56,785 --> 01:40:00,312
You open it up.
Open it up!

1738
01:40:00,356 --> 01:40:03,189
Go ahead, open it up.
Do what he says.

1739
01:40:03,225 --> 01:40:04,988
Hurry.

1740
01:40:09,865 --> 01:40:12,356
What is this?
What is this?

1741
01:40:12,401 --> 01:40:14,096
Where's all the money?

1742
01:40:14,136 --> 01:40:17,071
That's as good
as money, sir.

1743
01:40:17,106 --> 01:40:19,597
Those are IOUs.
Go ahead and add it up.

1744
01:40:19,642 --> 01:40:21,576
Every cent's
accounted for.

1745
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:24,545
Look. See this?

1746
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:26,844
That's a car.
275 thou.

1747
01:40:26,882 --> 01:40:29,043
Might want to hang on
to that one.

1748
01:40:32,855 --> 01:40:35,881
You're a dead man.
You're a dead man!

1749
01:40:40,863 --> 01:40:43,798
Lloyd, I'm home!

1750
01:40:43,832 --> 01:40:47,131
Look, we've got to have
a serious talk.

1751
01:40:47,169 --> 01:40:48,693
<i>I got a confession
to make.</i>

1752
01:40:48,737 --> 01:40:50,568
Oh, good.
You found her.

1753
01:40:50,606 --> 01:40:52,164
I'll leave
you two alone.

1754
01:40:52,208 --> 01:40:54,403
No. Stay.

1755
01:40:55,411 --> 01:40:57,379
Ugh!

1756
01:41:00,849 --> 01:41:03,841
Yes, I'd like a one-way ticket
to Amsterdam

1757
01:41:03,886 --> 01:41:06,582
departing as soon
as possible, please.

1758
01:41:06,622 --> 01:41:09,216
How do you guys
know each other?

1759
01:41:09,258 --> 01:41:11,192
We used to be
best friends.

1760
01:41:11,227 --> 01:41:13,195
Yeah, until he turned
into a backstabber.

1761
01:41:13,229 --> 01:41:16,255
<i>Me a backstabber?
You got a lot of nerve.</i>

1762
01:41:16,298 --> 01:41:18,129
You knew I was
crazy about her!

1763
01:41:18,167 --> 01:41:20,465
And you knew I was crazy
about Fraida Felcher,

1764
01:41:20,502 --> 01:41:23,903
- and that didn't stop you, did it?
- (gasps)

1765
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:26,237
- What do you mean?
- (mimics) What do you mean?

1766
01:41:26,275 --> 01:41:28,175
Don't deny it, Lloyd.

1767
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:31,475
Fraida told me the whole sleazy story,
Mr. French Tickler.

1768
01:41:34,350 --> 01:41:36,875
Okay, what time does it...
what time does that leave?

1769
01:41:36,919 --> 01:41:38,887
Thank you...
wait a second.

1770
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:40,855
Can I have
a vegetarian meal?

1771
01:41:40,889 --> 01:41:43,289
I guess we both learned
a little something

1772
01:41:43,325 --> 01:41:45,793
- about each other today, didn't we?
- Yeah, you said it, pal.

1773
01:41:45,828 --> 01:41:47,489
Maybe we're not as good of
friends as we thought we were.

1774
01:41:47,529 --> 01:41:48,461
I guess not.

1775
01:41:48,497 --> 01:41:51,364
I mean, if one beautiful girl
can rip us apart like this,

1776
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:53,391
then maybe our friendship
isn't worth a damn.

1777
01:41:53,435 --> 01:41:54,868
Maybe we should
call it quits right now.

1778
01:41:54,903 --> 01:41:56,871
You just tell me
where to sign, bud.

1779
01:41:56,905 --> 01:41:58,896
Right on my ass
after you kiss it!

1780
01:41:58,941 --> 01:42:00,533
Kiss it?!
You kiss mine!

1781
01:42:00,576 --> 01:42:02,737
Both cheeks, both lips,
right here!

1782
01:42:02,778 --> 01:42:06,737
- Put it right...
- Shut up!

1783
01:42:08,751 --> 01:42:11,481
Now, which one of you losers
wants to get it first?

1784
01:42:12,955 --> 01:42:15,515
Over here...

1785
01:42:15,557 --> 01:42:17,957
I was the one that got you into
this whole mess.

1786
01:42:17,993 --> 01:42:20,291
Come on
and shoot me.

1787
01:42:20,329 --> 01:42:23,355
No! Wait! Wait.
No no, do me first.

1788
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:25,492
I stole your girl, Lloyd.
I deserve it.

1789
01:42:25,534 --> 01:42:26,967
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1790
01:42:27,002 --> 01:42:29,197
- No, you don't...
- Yes, I do!

1791
01:42:29,238 --> 01:42:31,604
Yesterday was one of the greatest
days of my life.

1792
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:35,770
Mary and I went skiing, we made
a snowman, she touched my leg.

1793
01:42:35,811 --> 01:42:38,177
Okay, kill him!

1794
01:42:44,653 --> 01:42:47,053
(sobbing)
Oh! Oh, no!

1795
01:42:48,524 --> 01:42:51,789
You killed my best friend,
you bastard!

1796
01:42:51,827 --> 01:42:53,454
If it's any consolation,

1797
01:42:53,495 --> 01:42:55,656
you're about
to be reunited.

1798
01:42:59,802 --> 01:43:01,736
(gun clicking)

1799
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:05,672
Harry!
You're alive!

1800
01:43:05,708 --> 01:43:08,404
And you're
a horrible shot.

1801
01:43:08,444 --> 01:43:10,503
Lucky me.

1802
01:43:10,546 --> 01:43:13,014
Police! Open up!
Nobody move!

1803
01:43:13,048 --> 01:43:16,415
Everybody freeze!
Get those hands up!

1804
01:43:16,452 --> 01:43:17,942
<i>Not you, dummy!</i>

1805
01:43:17,986 --> 01:43:19,544
<i>Man:
Get the gun.</i>

1806
01:43:19,588 --> 01:43:22,284
Special Officer
Beth Jordan, FBI.

1807
01:43:22,324 --> 01:43:23,882
Hey! Who?
But... huh?

1808
01:43:23,926 --> 01:43:25,860
Mr. Dunne,
thank you very much.

1809
01:43:25,894 --> 01:43:28,863
We couldn't have
done it without you.

1810
01:43:28,897 --> 01:43:30,421
We've been
following you guys

1811
01:43:30,466 --> 01:43:31,797
all the way
from Providence.

1812
01:43:31,834 --> 01:43:33,631
What's going on,
Harry?

1813
01:43:33,669 --> 01:43:36,968
Your name is Harry,
isn't it?

1814
01:43:37,005 --> 01:43:40,532
Yeah, she-she grabbed me down the lobby,
explained what was up.

1815
01:43:40,576 --> 01:43:42,669
Then they slapped
this bulletproof vest on me

1816
01:43:42,711 --> 01:43:44,838
and gave me a gun.

1817
01:43:46,615 --> 01:43:48,981
But what if he shot you
in the face?

1818
01:43:50,052 --> 01:43:52,452
What if he shot me
in the face?

1819
01:43:52,488 --> 01:43:54,786
That's a risk
we were willing to take.

1820
01:43:54,823 --> 01:43:56,688
How come I didn't
get a gun?

1821
01:43:56,725 --> 01:43:58,989
Did you
get a gun?

1822
01:43:59,027 --> 01:44:03,657
<i># We can't play
this game anymore #</i>

You were right,
Lloyd.

1829
01:44:28,924 --> 01:44:30,983
She was definitely
worth the trip.

1830
01:44:31,026 --> 01:44:35,554
Yeah. She's something,
ain't she, Harr?

1831
01:44:35,597 --> 01:44:37,462
I'm glad we were able

- You're okay.
- Okay, I'm just a little sore.

1836
01:44:51,547 --> 01:44:54,414
I'm sorry.
Oh, sweetie.

<i>Oh, baby, I missed
your loving.</i>

Honey, there's someone
I want to introduce you to.

1839
01:44:59,054 --> 01:45:01,488
He's the kindest,
gentlest man I've ever met.

1840
01:45:01,523 --> 01:45:03,354
- Will you meet him?
- Sure.

1841
01:45:03,392 --> 01:45:05,758
He's got a gun!

<i>Mary:
Lloyd? Lloyd!</i>

Huh?

1844
01:45:13,402 --> 01:45:16,496
I said this is
my husband Bobby.

1845
01:45:16,538 --> 01:45:19,530
- Oh. Hi, Bobby.
- Hi.

1846
01:45:19,575 --> 01:45:24,069
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

1847
01:45:24,112 --> 01:45:26,945
Thank you both
very much.

1848

this, Lloyd.

First Mary dumps us,

1852
01:45:55,911 --> 01:45:57,845
then the cops take
our nest egg.

1853
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,973
- Then our hog breaks down.
- Yeah!

01:46:00,015 --> 01:46:03,143
When are we ever
gonna catch a break?

You are in luck!

1864
01:46:33,782 --> 01:46:37,047
There's a town about
three miles that way.

1865
01:46:37,085 --> 01:46:39,349
I'm sure you'll find
a couple guys there.

1866
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:44,615
Okay. Thanks.

1867
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,753
Bye!

1868
01:46:53,869 --> 01:46:56,497
Do you realize
what you've done?

1869
01:46:56,538 --> 01:47:00,167
- Hey!
- Lloyd!

1870
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:02,870
Lloyd!

1871
01:47:10,586 --> 01:47:12,884
You'll have to
excuse my friend.

1872
01:47:12,921 --> 01:47:15,890
He's a little slow.

1873
01:47:15,924 --> 01:47:19,018
<i>The town is
back that way.</i>

1874
01:47:28,670 --> 01:47:30,194
Wow.

1875
01:47:30,238 --> 01:47:32,138
Two lucky guys

1876
01:47:32,174 --> 01:47:34,267
are gonna be driving around
with those girls

1877
01:47:34,309 --> 01:47:36,174
for the next
couple of months.

1878
01:47:36,211 --> 01:47:38,873
Yeah, don't worry.

1879
01:47:38,914 --> 01:47:40,745
We'll catch
our break too.

1880
01:47:40,782 --> 01:47:44,274
- Just gotta keep our eyes open.
- Yeah.

1881
01:47:44,319 --> 01:47:45,752
<i># Now, we've been
friends forever... #</i>

1882
01:47:45,787 --> 01:47:47,185
<i># Now, we've been
friends forever... #</i>

1883
01:47:47,222 --> 01:47:49,918
- You're it.
- You're it.

1884
01:47:49,958 --> 01:47:51,687
You're it.
Quitsies.

1885
01:47:51,727 --> 01:47:53,695
You're it. Anti-quitsies,
double-stamp.

1886
01:47:53,729 --> 01:47:56,254
You're it. Anti-quitsies,
triple-stamp.

1887
01:47:56,298 --> 01:47:58,289
- No erasies, none at all.
- You can't triple-stamp.

1888
01:47:58,333 --> 01:48:00,563
Yes, if you have a double-stamp,
of course you can.

1889
01:48:00,602 --> 01:48:02,160
- You can't triple-stamp!
- # La la la la la... #

1890
01:48:02,204 --> 01:48:04,172
You can't if you
have a double-stamp!

1891
01:48:04,206 --> 01:48:05,969
You can't triple-stamp...
the rule!

1892
01:48:06,008 --> 01:48:09,967
You can't triple-stamp
a double-stamp, Lloyd!

1893
01:48:10,012 --> 01:48:12,845
Lloyd! Lloyd!

1894
01:48:14,082 --> 01:48:17,984
