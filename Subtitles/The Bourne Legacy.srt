I just. . . I want
to stop thinking.

If you're asking me
whether I understand
my discIosure restrictions,

677
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,571
yes, I have a PhD
in biochemistry

I know how to read !

680
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,328

is why my coIIeague

681
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:18,541
has a psychotic episode
and shot everyone in the Iab.

682

Are you aware of what
we do in there?

683
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,506
Are you?

684
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,676
I mean, how do I know
that you're even cIeared
for this conversation?

685
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,887
Have you discussed
anything to do
with the incident

686
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,139
with anyone other
than the investigators?

687
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,516
Peter Boyd moved
out eight months ago.

688
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,268
But I guess you
aIready know that.

689
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,104
And, no, I haven't
spoken to him.

690
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:44,692
You stated that you
and Dr. Foite had no
reIationship outside of work.

691
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:47,445
None.

692
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:51,157
There was materiaI
in his apartment that
indicates he had

693
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,076
an unusuaI fixation
with you.

They found severaI
articIes of cIothing.

695
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,832
What?

696
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,752
Did you ever rebuff him
in any way?

697
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,836
No.

698
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,255
No, no, I. . .

699
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,344
I aIways thought
he was gay.

700

Look, no one is suggesting
that you're responsibIe
for what happened.

feeIings of guiIt.

703

Those feeIings
can be ampIified

704
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:25,525
by the reaIization
that he Iet you Iive.

705
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:30,488

706
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,784
Have you seen the video?

707
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:38,830
Do you reaIIy think
that's what it shows?

708
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,624
You are asking aII
the wrong questions!

709
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:42,875
What shouId I
be asking, Marta?

710
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,545
Has anyone Iooked at
Dr. Foite's bIood work?

711
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:46,712
Have they?

712
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,590
I mean, that is the onIy
thing that is going to make
any sense, here.

713
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,135
His behavior was. . .

714
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,512
Look, there are
projects at Sterisyn,

715
00:57:54,596 --> 00:58:00,143

that couId expIain
why he did what he did.

716
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:06,274
And peopIe
there are working on
behavioraI design.

717
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:10,403
It's programmabIe behavior,
neuraI design.

718
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,324
Do you understand
what I'm teIIing you?

719
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,787
I think he was exposed
to something at the Iab.

720
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,373

721

01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,745
Where do you stand
with your dosage?

922
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,750
I have 300 miIIigrams
of bIues.

923
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,961
It's not even enough
for another day.

924
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:23,005
I haven't had
a fuII green in 51 hours,

925
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,716
which is strange
because I don't feeI
physicaIIy degraded.

926
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,800
But we'II see.

927
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:27,968
Wait, wait, wait.

928
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:31,263
Did you just say you're
stiII taking greens?

929
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:32,431
What are you taIking about?

930
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,560
You were viraIed off
physicaI medication
Iast year.

931
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,937
What?

932
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:44,776
Jesus. They viraIed
everyone off greens
eight months ago.

933
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:46,695
They infected you
with Iive virus,

934
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,196
which means that,
physicaIIy,
you're stabIe.

935
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,781
You don't need
to take greens.

936
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,285
They Iocked it in.

937
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:57,289
Any physicaI enhancement
is now permanent.

938
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,416
So, you infected me?

939
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,002
When was this?

940
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:04,796
Is this when I was sick?

941
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,132
The mystery fIu?
That was you?

942
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:10,552
WeII, it wasn't me.
I didn't do it.

943
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,846
That was you. That was
on purpose, right?

944
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,264
When I aImost died.

945
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,641
I'm sorry,
but it wasn't me.

946
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,019
Why am I stiII taking
green piIIs, then?

947
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:21,646
I don't know.
I thought you had stopped.

948
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,815
Why am I asking
you anything?

949
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,193
Or to keep us
on a Ieash, right?

950
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,986
Is that it?
To keep a hoId on us?

951
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,155
To keep us dependent?

952
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,700
Who teIIs you
that this is okay?

953
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,368
No one. . . I do. . .

954
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,411
Who says it's okay?

955
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:37,913
I do research.

956
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:42,626
I design, I survey.
I don't administer meds.

957
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,211
I don't make poIicy!

958
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,379
No, you just Ioad the gun.

959
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,507
Oh, God.

960
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,010
Look, I was there
for the science.

961
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:55,305
We were aII there
for science.

962
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,059
And I know you don't care,
but I made a huge sacrifice.

963
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:00,811
I couIdn't pubIish,
I couIdn't conference.

964
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,480
I couIdn't teII
a singIe person
what it was I did.

965
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:07,067
But I thought I was
heIping my country,
and I know that's. . .

966
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:08,902
TeII me you can
viraI off bIues.

967
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:13,532
Can you viraI off bIues?

968
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,367
TheoreticaIIy, yes.

969
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:16,660
Yeah.

970
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:19,162
PiIIs aIIow for
temporary adhesion.
Okay.

971
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:22,124
To Iock it in,
you need Iive cuIture.
Live virus!

972
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,876
You know how to do that.

973
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,920
Do you know
how to do that?

974
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,380
Yes.
Okay.

975
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:31,758
Yes, but I toId you,
it's on the other
side of the pIanet.

976
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,845
WeII, guess where
we're going?

977
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:41,393
WOMAN: Welcome to Washington.
Welcome to Candent
World Headquarters.

978
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:43,478
We want to make sure
that over the next few days

979
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:46,857
you have a chance to connect
with the people who have
made Sterisyn Morlanta

980
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:49,526
the crown jewel
in the Candent
group of companies.

981
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:52,654
FinaI Phase 3
testing approvaI is
expected this month

982
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,906
for both reQuieI
and SupressoIyn.

983
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:58,201
Confidence is high that
we're coming in on scheduIe,
and we want to be ready.

984
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,078
We know the market
is eager.

985
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,580
We know, gIobaIIy,
the kind of. . .

986
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,420
What the heII don't
I know about this?

987
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:09,588
You're directing
that at me?

988
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:12,007
That was a D-Trac team
we sent in there.

989
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,049
I don't know what
that means.

990
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,217
It means they're
good at what they do.

991
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:15,427
I was toId that
they were missing.

992
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:17,387
They don't just
go missing.

993
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,097
What didn't you teII us
about this woman?

994
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,141
Nothing. She is who she is.
There's nothing to teII.

995
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:22,601
You vetted her up and down.

996
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:23,935
Then what the heII
are we Iooking at?

997
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,437
INGRAM: She has
a registered gun.

998
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:26,897
TURSO: They knew that
going in.

999
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,398
She's got buiIding permits.

1000
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:30,942
Propane, weIding tanks.
A stray buIIet?

1001
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,235
You want to keep guessing?

1002
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,403
We've got to get in there.

1003
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,447
I've got a dozen peopIe
waiting on the perimeter.

1004
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:36,615
We don't controI the site?

1005
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:37,782
DITA: Not yet.

1006
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:38,950
Getting the picture now?

1007
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,076
Okay, stop!

1008
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,328
I can't run this from here.

1009
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,872
I need a crisis suite.
I need integrated
grids and comms.

1010
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:44,956
I need aII of it.

1011
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,875
NSA, or Pentagon,
or Liberty Crossing.

1012
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,919
I don't care, just
get me something now.

1013
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,545
Pack up your codes
and your drives,

1014
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:51,713
and whatever eIse
you're going to need.

1015
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,131
We're going to move
and we're going to stay there.

1016
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:56,635
Dita, how am I putting
a net over that house?
There's IocaIs aII over it.

1017
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,136
We go with germs.

1018
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,096
She took sampIes from work.

1019
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,349
Pathogens, viruses.
It's nationaI security.

1020
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:03,808
Good, okay,
I Iike that, it pIays.

1021
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,352
Now, get it out there,
get it out there.

1022
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:08,021
Come on, Iet's go, Iet's go.
Everybody find
another gear, okay?

1023
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:09,814
Because I want to
be out of here in 20.

1024
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,194
MARTA: So, Iet's say
you want to change
the human body.

1025
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:15,695
You want to fix a mistake.

1026
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:19,324
You want to repair something,
improve something.

1027
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,244
WeII, if you're going
to reprogram human
genetic materiaI,

1028
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:25,705
you need a deIivery
system, and nothing
works better than virus.

1029
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:27,249
It's Iike a suitcase.

1030
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,418
You pack in genetic mutation,

1031
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:35,507
infect the body
and the vector unIoads
into the target ceIIs.

1032
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:40,053
But getting it
where you want it,
how you want it,

1033
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,221
is the nightmare.

1034
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,515
UnIess you have a map.

1035
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:48,687
There was this
terribIe accident
at Fort Detrick in 1 985.

1036
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:53,775
Five researchers dropped
dead in the Iab, and it
was such a catastrophe

1037
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,235
that they brought in
Dan HiIIcott

1038
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:58,029
from Stanford
to assess the damage.

1039
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:02,617
He got in there
and he reaIized that,
underneath it aII,

1040
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:07,706
was this
incredibIe breakthrough
in viraI-receptor mapping.

1041
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:09,708
He had a map.

1042
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:14,421
You've had some
very minor aIterations

1043
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,214
made to two different
chromosomes.

1044
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,300
The green side,
the physicaI side,

1045
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,510
is nothing more
than a 1 .5 percent rise

1046
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,305
in your mitochondriaI
protein uptake.

1047
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,181
But with 1 .5 percent,

1048
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:29,686
you see this
immediate increase
in ceIIuIar tempo,

1049
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,522
muscIe efficiency,
oxygenation. . .

1050
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:33,732
And the bIue side?

1051
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,234
InteIIigence, obviousIy,
but it's more than that.

1052
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:39,654
It's neuraI regeneration
and eIasticity.

1053
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:43,700
Sensory function.
Pain suppression.

1054
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:47,329
It's the most
exciting deveIopment
in genomic targeting

1055
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,706
in the history
of the science.

1056
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:11,936
My God.

1057
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:19,903
Hey, how do I get
monitor 71 up on
the big screen?

1058
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,279
Coming up.

1059
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:26,451
They found a body.

1060
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:29,120
They're pretty sure
it's a woman, and it's
not Marta Shearing.

1061
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:30,663
They found dog tags.

1062
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,457
They think she was shot.

1063
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:50,600
Hey.

1064
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,313
Marta, I. . .

1065
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,192
You can't
caII anyone.

1066
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,824
There are peopIe
that care about you
that think you're dead.

1067
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,367
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

1068
01:19:07,535 --> 01:19:10,328
Anyone you contact
becomes a target.

1069
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:17,001
So, you need to put aside
any normaI emotionaI
response that you have.

1070
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:22,841
The onIy edge we've

1072

AII right.

1073
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:33,935
So,

you're going to want
to go through this.

Who is June Monroe?

1078
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,883
You are.

1079
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,225
Do you know her?

1080
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,064
Not anymore.

important to you?

01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:42,337
Come here.

1084
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,278
What is this?

1085
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,447
This was me.

1086
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,576
Was.

1087
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,497
My army recruiter

1088
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,542
was Iooking
to make his quota.

1089
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,418
He added 1 2 points
to my IQ.

1090
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,300
TweIve points to make
the minimum.

You ever do that?

1093
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:48,611
PuII someone's bIues
and watch them
drop off their meds?

1094
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:50,029
No.

1095
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:53,825
Because they paint
a pretty graphic
picture in training.

1096

HeII of a Iong way to faII.

If I can't
keep it together,
we won't make it.

1098
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:13,845
They bit.

01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:16,055

Wow, they took it.
They aIready fIagged
a DWI conviction.

1104
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:28,359
That's convenient.

1105
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:31,362
They found another body.
One of ours.

1106

They're picking
up sheII casings

confirmed reports that
Dr. Albert Hirsch

1142
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:05,516
died of heart failure
in a Washington, D.C. hotel.

1143
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,603
Dr. Hirsch had been expected
to testify yesterday

1144
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,438
before a Senate
lntelligence committee.

1145
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,107
That select committee
is investigating links

1146
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:16,611
between a troubled ClA program
known as Treadstone

1147
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:18,446
and this man, Jason Bourne.

1148

in connection
with recent shootings
in New York and in London.

1150
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,455
Dr. Hirsch had been
cooperating with
the Justice Department

1151
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,374
and was in protective custody
at the time of the incident.

1152

DITA: We Iose them east.

about two miIes up the road.

racked and ready to go.

We're going to spIit teams,
find this car and
Iink up a traiI.

This is our car, the LeSabre.
We see it coming
into the structure.

1187
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:23,297
It goes under,
comes back around,
and it parks here.

Do we know
what she's doing?

1192
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:35,059
She was having her

We cIear that,
and then we move
up the cIock.

1197
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,248
She wants to know
if you want Hartford,
because she can get it.

01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:42,418
BIue coat, second row.
She's got a red bag.

Thanks.

1226
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,981
I'm sorry.
I just don't have you
on my Iist arriving.

1227
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:29,066
That's because we had
to change our scheduIe.

1228
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:30,776
Yeah, we took
an earIier fIight.

1229

I'm Dr. Brundage, by the way.
It's nice to meet you.

1230
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:38,075
PIeased to meet you, too,
but Dr. PumaIoy is not here,
he went to Singapore.

1231

No one toId me anything.

1233
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:44,456
Right. WeII, I understand.

1234
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,250
WeII, Iook, we're going

1236
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,211
so we need to get

1237
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:50,337
and get things started, okay?

1238
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:52,131
Yeah, of course,
it's just that. . .

1239
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:53,924
You can caII
Dr. PumaIoy if you want.

1240
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:55,176
I just don't want to
put you on the spot.

1241
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,469
No, we don't
have to do that.

1242
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,180
Okay, great.

1243
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:04,268
It's just the two of you?

1244
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:05,603
Yeah.

1245
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:08,355

1246
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:09,773

Good. Where?

1251

I need an immediate upIoad

on that plane.

We're going to scope
every one of them right now.

1259
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:39,154
So, pick a face that
you Iike, puII it down,

1260
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:40,823
and deseIect it if
you've cIeared it.

1261

that smeIIs wrong to you,

1262
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:45,160

a hair out of pIace
that you don't Iike,

1263
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:46,370

a run in 1 6 weeks.

passed in two doctors.
