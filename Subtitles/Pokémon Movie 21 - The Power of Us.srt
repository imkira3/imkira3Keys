00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:10,661
Risa!

3
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:11,706
See you!

4
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:12,663
See you later!

5
00:00:28,723 --> 00:00:29,811
Yeah?

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,205
Oh, it's you, Sis.

7
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,644
Change of clothes.

8
00:00:36,644 --> 00:00:38,646
How's your leg?

9
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:41,388
It's just fine as long as
I don't move it around too much.

10
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:44,869
You've gotta
be more careful!

11
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:47,089
Well what about your leg?

12
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,613
So. Are you running?

13
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:52,051
You just
worry about yourself.

14
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,661
Okay, okay.

15
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:56,707
Hey, Risa? Heard of the
Wind Festival in Fula City?

16
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:58,318
Yeah, I've heard of it.
What about it?

17
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:00,668
It's supposed to
be a really big event.

18
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:01,756
So...

19
00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:03,018
About that...

20
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:04,672
I wanna ask you a favor.

21
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:07,022
Uh...

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,590
I'm home...

23
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:25,606
Me catch a Pokémon?!

24
00:01:25,606 --> 00:01:26,781
No, no WAY!

25
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:28,522
But Risa! I'm begging you!

26
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:31,177
Not a chance!
Why are you asking me?

27
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:33,657
Come on! Would you
take a look at my leg?

28
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:36,051
What if I went out
and suddenly collapsed?

29
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:37,748
And nobody was around to help?

30
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:40,403
I mean, there I am, losing
consciousness, and the only

31
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:42,449
person I'm thinking about
is my amazing sister!

32
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:45,626
Is that what you want? Huh?!
I mean how could you?

33
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:47,149
Okay, I'll try!

34
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,238
But no guarantees!
Got it?

35
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:50,631
All right!

36
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:52,981
But I don't expect
you to do it for nothing!

37
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:54,504
Take it. Here!

38
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:55,897
What's this for?

39
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,812
Something
to say thank you.

40
00:01:57,812 --> 00:02:00,075
Wear them and have
fun at the festival!

41
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:02,121
Wow! They're pretty cute!

42
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,992
Not too shabby,
little brother...

43
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:09,084
Catching a Pokémon...

44
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,327
There will
be an award ceremony for

45
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:35,893
the winner of the catch race.

46
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,026
All right.

47
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:39,158
Father!

48
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:41,725
Morning, Margo!

49
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:44,206
Are you going to the
Wind Festival today?

50
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,816
You take care then!

51
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:46,730
You, too, Father!

52
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,561
Yes!

53
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:29,991
This young man is
Ash Ketchum, from Pallet Town.

54
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:32,646
With his partner,
Pikachu, he's working hard

55
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,517
to become a Pokémon Master...

56
00:03:34,517 --> 00:03:36,998
So, his
journey continues.

57
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:39,348
He's arrived
in a city that lives in

58
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:40,741
harmony with the wind...

59
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:42,743
Fula City.
And right now...

60
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:45,833
...the city is
holding its Wind Festival.

61
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,488
Wow, this looks like fun!

62
00:03:56,713 --> 00:03:57,801
Pikachu!

63
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,500
There's even
better stuff over here!

64
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:04,112
It looked
light and fluffy and yummy!

65
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:08,072
Hey... Never thought
it would be this lively...

66
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:11,380
This isn't bad at all!

67
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,816
Not bad at all.

68
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:16,342
Now look, you,
stay away from me!

69
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:18,866
Pity's sake.

70
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,476
A lady can't even look
at flowers in peace!

71
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:22,086
Uh...

72
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:25,176
Impossible! I mean...
It's tomorrow, right?

73
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,961
No, no, I know, but...

74
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:28,354
Is everything all right?

75
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:30,181
Yeah, everything's fine.
Don't touch them.

76
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:31,444
Now, where was I?

77
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:33,881
Can't we work something
out here? I mean...

78
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:35,056
Yeah?

79
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:39,713
Kellie, are you hurt?

80
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,844
I'm okay!

81
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:42,150
Watch where you're going!

82
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,283
But this
place is so much fun!

83
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:45,980
O--kay!

84
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,635
I'll take you
somewhere that's even more fun!

85
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:50,289
There are
lots of places to play!

86
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,465
I love you,
Uncle Callahan!

87
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:18,665
The Pokémon Channel!

88
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:21,232
Here we go!
It's the Pokémon Channel!

89
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:24,453
Get ready!
This only happens once a year.

90
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:26,934
We're talking the
Wind Festival in Fula City!

91
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:30,024
Aww! I wanted to go, too...

92
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:31,895
If that's what you poor kids

93
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:34,115
are thinking then I'm your guy!

94
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:35,899
There's no need to fear!

95
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,902
This channel will bring you
all the news from the festival!

96
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:41,209
They say
that the festival was formed

97
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,037
after a promise with Lugia!

98
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:45,213
See,
once this place was a

99
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:46,693
barren, desolate land!

100
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:48,521
But
even so, people and Pokémon

101
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:50,131
supported each other!

102
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:52,394
Lugia
saw their bonds of friendship

103
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,528
and promised to grant
them the power of wind!

104
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:56,877
And
the people used that power to

105
00:05:56,877 --> 00:05:59,270
build and develop Fula City!

106
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,186
Ever since,
Lugia comes to town once a year.

107
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:03,971
After
seeing the bonds of friendship

108
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:06,539
between people and Pokémon,
it gives them the gift of

109
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,715
the wind for another year!

110
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:11,718
But wait.

111
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:14,503
There's one more thing you
should know. A long time ago...

112
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:16,679
There was
a fire. On a nearby mountain!

113
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:19,029
But Lugia put it out!

114
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,381
Uncle Callahan?!

115
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:26,341
See?
I bought some ice cream!

116
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:28,082
Here!
This one's all for you!

117
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:29,605
Oh, thank you, Kellie!

118
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,959
Uncle Callahan,
please show me your Pokémon!

119
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,309
Do you have the
strongest Pokémon ever EVER?

120
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,137
Uh, of course I do!

121
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:41,225
See?

122
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:42,792
What kind is it?

123
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,577
The strongest kind!

124
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:45,578
Let me see!

125
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:46,709
No!!

126
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,319
See,
now's not a good time.

127
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,061
It was just in a giant
battle! And it's exhausted.

128
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:53,194
Hey, look out!
Your ice cream!

129
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:55,457
It's dripping!

130
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,720
Thank you.
You're a good brother.

131
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,201
Kellie just had to come,
no matter what.

132
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,594
No prob.

133
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:04,379
But is she...
Is she up to this?

134
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,947
Yes. She's been
feeling good lately.

135
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,212
Uncle Callahan!?

136
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:13,649
What kind
of Pokémon is that?

137
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:17,174
Ah, that's the
Legendary Pokémon Lugia.

138
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:19,046
Lugia's the
reason this city has grown

139
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:20,439
to the size it has!

140
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,137
Uncle Callahan,
you know everything!

141
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:25,400
It happened
long, long ago.

142
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,402
It was a cold day.

143
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,883
I had just
arrived in town for work.

144
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,841
When suddenly--

145
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:34,975
I began to see a
red glow up on the mountain.

146
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:38,065
It then occurred to
me that red glow was a fire!

147
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:39,370
I screamed...

148
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,285
Townspeople,
listen to me!

149
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:44,463
The fire's
coming closer! Run!

150
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,204
I called for Lugia.
Hoping for help!

151
00:07:47,204 --> 00:07:50,599
And Lugia came and
put out that mountain fire!

152
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,688
Since then,
the town has been living

153
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,560
happily ever after!

154
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,258
The end! Thank you.

155
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:59,303
Uncle Callahan,
Awesome! Yay!

156
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:01,088
Yay!

157
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:03,090
You lied!
Why do you do that?

158
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,527
It's not lying.
It's called dramatic license.

159
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,137
So, Kellie!

160
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:08,574
Where to next?

161
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:10,837
I see some
fun stuff over there...

162
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:12,447
Yay, let's go!

163
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:14,449
If only I could speak
in front of people like that...

164
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:19,715
Lemonade! Lemonade!

165
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:22,152
Hey lady!
How about some Lemonade?

166
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:24,503
Phanpy!

167
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,504
Hold it!

168
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:31,466
Now what's going on
here?! Keep it away from me!

169
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:33,599
Sorry.
We didn't mean it!

170
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,177
Didn't you know?!

171
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:49,484
That lady's world-famous
for hating Pokémon!

172
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:50,572
Are you serious?

173
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,140
Don't let go!

174
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,142
See her hand?
Who wears a glove in summer?

175
00:08:58,014 --> 00:08:59,102
Margo!

176
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,103
I'm sorry!

177
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:01,017
The mayor's daughter!

178
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:03,367
Hey!

179
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,152
Great, what'll we do now?

180
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:06,588
Now we can't make
Lemonade because you

181
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,720
knocked everything over!

182
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,678
I'm... I'm sorry!

183
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,593
You see,
I'm in a hurry...

184
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,681
Don't give me that!

185
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:14,683
You're
gonna pay for this!

186
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,080
Just calm down...

187
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:23,213
After all,
this is a festival,

188
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:24,519
so let's have some fun!

189
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:27,827
Hey! Who do
you think you are?!

190
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:29,698
Get him, Phanpy!
Use Rollout!

191
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:32,222
Dodge it!

192
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:38,881
Oh, wow...

193
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:39,969
Now use Iron Tail!

194
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:43,712
Phanpy, use Tackle!

195
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:51,415
So you wanna
go another round?

196
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:53,896
I'm...I'm letting
you off easy today...

197
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:56,682
We're going home!

198
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:58,553
We're not
gonna forget this!

199
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:00,686
Thank you!

200
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:02,688
No prob. Are you okay?

201
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:04,733
Sure. Thank
you, too, Pikachu!

202
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:08,389
My name's Ash,
from Pallet Town.

203
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,217
This is my partner,
Pikachu.

204
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:12,611
I'm Margo.

205
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,482
Did you two come
here for the Wind Festival?

206
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:15,614
Yup. You bet!

207
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,008
Impressive!

208
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:21,271
Indeed! Such agility!

209
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:24,448
So what plan to pinch
Pikachu is on today's menu?

210
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:27,451
The right one. We'll
start our own juice business.

211
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:29,062
A perfect idea,
of course...

212
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,498
Let's get started.

213
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:32,239
JAMES/Wait,
you're not serious!

214
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:35,242
We can help those
thirsty folks. Success is the

215
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:38,985
right product at the right time.
And we've managed both!

216
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:40,726
We're cool cash magnets!

217
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:43,685
What about Pikachu?
How does that relate?

218
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,730
Do you get it?

219
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:49,430
Wow! Cash
relates to everything!

220
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:54,783
Then we'll
be able to see Lugia?

221
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:57,351
Sure. On the
last day of the festival.

222
00:10:57,351 --> 00:10:59,309
After all,
it's the main event!

223
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:01,224
Sounds awesome!

224
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:02,573
Hey! Look at that!

225
00:11:03,618 --> 00:11:05,446
The eternal flame!

226
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:09,102
Lugia first sees the
flame, then it sends the wind.

227
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,887
Wow... And, what's that?

228
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:13,715
An old power plant.

229
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,369
That's what I've heard.

230
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:17,937
It broke down years ago
during a fire on the mountain.

231
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:20,156
They haven't used it since.

232
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:22,811
I also heard that
during the fire, Lugia brought

233
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,639
heavy rains and put it out!

234
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,293
Lugia's just so cool!

235
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,557
Well, I'm gonna
be heading this way.

236
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:31,907
And the Wind
Festival is over that way.

237
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:33,517
Got it. Thanks a lot.

238
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:34,954
See you later!

239
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:35,955
Later!

240
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:42,178
Wow...

241
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:43,397
All right!

242
00:11:43,397 --> 00:11:45,791
Oh yeah!
I am the best at this!

243
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,922
Congratulations!

244
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:48,097
See that folks,
everybody's a winner!

245
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:48,968
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

246
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:50,056
Here ya go, pal!

247
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:51,448
Thanks, kid!

248
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:52,841
This is for you.

249
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:55,235
You did it!
Thanks, Uncle Callahan!

250
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:57,106
I'd win
a dozen before lunch.

251
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:58,673
Good for you, Kellie.

252
00:11:58,673 --> 00:12:00,631
This toy that Uncle
Callahan won for me will be

253
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:02,329
my treasure forever and ever!

254
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,073
You all right?

255
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,292
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:10,903
Me, too! Are you hurt?

257
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:12,426
Thanks. I'm fine.

258
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:14,210
I wasn't looking
where I was going.

259
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:20,129
'Scuse me.
Where's your Pokémon?

260
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:21,609
Oh.

261
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,567
I came here to catch one.

262
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:26,788
And it must be super-rare
because I haven't found a thing!

263
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,834
All you have to do
is ask Uncle Callahan!

264
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,139
Me?!

265
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,880
He's the best
Pokémon Trainer ever!

266
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,273
Really?

267
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:35,144
Please tell me where
to catch one, please?

268
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:36,798
All right.
What Pokémon?

269
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:40,280
It's this one.

270
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,803
Oh. That one.

271
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,544
It's
super rare, all right.

272
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:46,590
Yeah? It is?
Where can I find it?

273
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,636
Hold on, hold on...

274
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:51,552
I've got it!
Over there, over there!

275
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:54,381
The latest info
says it's up on that mountain!

276
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:56,949
That's wonderful!
That's so nice of you!

277
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:58,777
No prob.

278
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,047
Now you've done it, buddy!

279
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,747
Coming up on Main Street

280
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:14,488
the Wind Festival's exciting...

281
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:16,403
...Pokémon catch race!

282
00:13:16,403 --> 00:13:18,971
All Pokémon Trainers
are encouraged to join

283
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:19,972
in on the fun!

284
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:22,278
Pikachu, did you hear that?

285
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:27,370
Uncle Callahan!
It's a catch race! Do it!

286
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,285
I'm sure
you'll be the winner!

287
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:31,679
Of course!
No doubt I will!

288
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,551
After all, I'm the
best Trainer that ever trained!

289
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:36,640
I'll bring down
the strongest of the strong,

290
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,121
and win the trophy to give
to Kellie as a present!

291
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:42,298
Yeah?! All right!!

292
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:43,560
Come on, now.

293
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:50,002
The speaker isn't coming?

294
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:51,220
Now what, Toren?

295
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,439
I'll
think of something...

296
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,007
What do you mean,
think of something?!

297
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,401
You know
the presentation's tomorrow.

298
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:01,665
Find someone? You could've
just asked us to...

299
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:04,320
I'll be all right!

300
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,757
I'll figure
something out, don't worry.

301
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:09,238
We need this
to continue our research.

302
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:11,414
You of all people
should know how important

303
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:12,415
that is, Toren!

304
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:16,289
We're counting on you.

305
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,209
What's in there?

306
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:24,863
Winning a catch race...

307
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,952
This says it's
the Pokémon Research Pavilion.

308
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:28,649
Pokémon
Research Pavilion?

309
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:35,656
Anybody
work around here?

310
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:39,051
Yes. That would be me.

311
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:41,662
This awful heat
has finally gotten my brains

312
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:43,707
to the point where
they're extra crispy.

313
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,057
I don't
think you're crazy...

314
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,540
I'm sorry!
Did it touch your clothes?!

315
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,759
No...

316
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,674
But don't
you go jumping out from

317
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:54,805
behind things, understand?!

318
00:14:54,805 --> 00:14:56,068
Want to give me a heart attack?!

319
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:57,460
No, of course not...

320
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,767
Here. Sign these...

321
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:01,943
...and give them
to festival administration.

322
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,379
Yes. I will!

323
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,946
Right.

324
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,034
I'm very sorry.

325
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,172
Brother! You're
a Pokémon Re... searcher...

326
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:16,088
And that means you
know everything about Pokémon!

327
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:18,090
A-ha!

328
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:54,822
These are for you two.

329
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:56,824
Dig in.

330
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:04,049
I'm sorry! I know it's
my fault that you got hurt.

331
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:05,964
The Oran Berries
will help you get better,

332
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,182
so eat them all up, okay?

333
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:12,448
Be back soon.

334
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:28,421
Wow... So many people!

335
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,640
Lots of luck,
Uncle Callahan!

336
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:34,470
I wonder what kind of
Pokémon we'll be catching...

337
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,124
It'll be fun, right pal?

338
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:39,214
Get your Lum Berry juice!

339
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:40,520
Perfect for a catch race!

340
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,783
Give something
healthy to your Pokémon!

341
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:45,481
Lum Berries are
the best thing for a Pokémon!

342
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:48,441
It's a very special
berry that can cure sleepiness,

343
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,921
numbness, confusion, or just
about anything that ails ya!

344
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:53,707
Hello everyone!

345
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:55,970
We're just about to begin the
Wind Festival's catch race!

346
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,191
The rules are
simple! Pokémon with a special

347
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:02,150
mark are waiting all over Fula
City for Trainers to come along!

348
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:06,241
But some of
them are very strong Pokémon,

349
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:08,330
too, and they won't
be caught so easily!

350
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:11,246
Participating
Trainers must catch these

351
00:17:11,246 --> 00:17:13,509
Pokémon with special
catch race Poké Balls!

352
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:16,686
Points
will be awarded according

353
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:17,600
to a Pokémon's strength.

354
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,429
The Trainer
with the most points at

355
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:21,648
the end of the competition
...will be the winner!

356
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:24,433
Testing.
One, two, three. Come in.

357
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,175
Everything's fine.

358
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:29,308
I can hear
you loud and clear.

359
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:32,398
Mr. Callahan, if I
do this, then you'll do our

360
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:34,008
presentation for us right?

361
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:37,098
Of course I will.
It's a win-win for both of us.

362
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,882
So I'm counting on you.

363
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:41,972
Right. But I
sincerely want you to avoid

364
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:43,626
overworking my Staryu, okay?

365
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:44,932
You've got it!

366
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:46,847
Trainers
to the starting line!

367
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:48,283
Ready?!

368
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:49,676
GO!

369
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:50,894
Let's hit it, Pikachu!

370
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,032
We'll catch a bunch
and win that trophy!

371
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:01,166
An Ekans!

372
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:04,038
Use Quick Attack!

373
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:09,739
Go!

374
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:14,831
Yes!

375
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:16,442
We caught
our first Pokémon!

376
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:22,535
It's strong!

377
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:34,373
The Trainers are really

378
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:35,765
scooping up those Pokémon!

379
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,638
But the
trainer catching the most?

380
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,205
A guy named Callahan!

381
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:41,510
Go,
Uncle Callahan, go, go!

382
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:44,644
Staryu's
Ability is Illuminate!

383
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:46,254
Other Pokémon love it!

384
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:47,734
And they're
making awfully good use of it...

385
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:04,229
Pikachu, see that?

386
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:07,841
Right. Let's go after it!

387
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,758
Aww...I'm beat!

388
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:13,934
You're doing great!
You're in first place!

389
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,988
Now what's going on?

390
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:47,533
Sudowoodo is weak
against water! You can catch it!

391
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,926
Oh, no!
We're just receiving word of...

392
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:51,885
...a Tyranitar
rampaging though the city,

393
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:54,540
and a Trainer named Ash
seems to be chasing it!

394
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,846
Uh, there
appears to be some sort of cord

395
00:19:56,846 --> 00:19:58,544
wrapped around Tyranitar's neck!

396
00:19:58,544 --> 00:19:59,545
No way!

397
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,289
Tyranitar!

398
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:11,165
Pikachu, do you think you
can lead Tyranitar over there?

399
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:14,299
I'm counting on you, buddy!

400
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:46,244
You know, you
shouldn't lie to yourself.

401
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,854
It's habit forming.

402
00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:50,683
That's the Imitation
Pokémon. That's what it does!

403
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,814
Shut up!

404
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:54,382
Hurry and
find me the next Pokémon.

405
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:25,761
I've got you now,
Tyranitar!

406
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:27,328
Oh, no!

407
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,678
There are dozens of people
right where Tyranitar's headed!

408
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:34,248
Right, Pikachu! Go for it!

409
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:35,902
Use Iron Tail!

410
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:45,433
Tyranitar!

411
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:49,959
Hey... Everything's gonna
be all right now! I promise.

412
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,352
You were great, Pikachu!

413
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,748
Fantastic!
Ash managed to save Tyranitar!

414
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,750
They created a
bond that's even stronger than

415
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,621
simply catching! What passion!

416
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:00,970
Can you stand?

417
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:07,194
We present
the Mayor's Prize to the

418
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:10,153
second-place finisher in the
catch race, Ash Ketchum, for his

419
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:12,460
brilliant rescue of Tyranitar!

420
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,244
Thank you very much!

421
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:18,031
Not so fast, son. Thank
you for rescuing Tyranitar.

422
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:20,120
All 'cause of Pikachu!

423
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,078
That's why it worked.

424
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:23,515
All 'cause of Pikachu!

425
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:29,347
And now! The
grand prize... goes to Callahan!

426
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,087
See, Kellie?

427
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:33,394
Uncle Callahan,
you're the best!

428
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:39,052
Congratulations
on your first-place finish

429
00:22:39,052 --> 00:22:40,706
Thanks!

430
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:43,273
But you come to expect
these sorts of things with me.

431
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:45,275
By the way,
are there any Pokémon that

432
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:46,668
you'd like to catch next?

433
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:48,191
Next? Let's see...

434
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:53,588
I've been hearing
there's an extremely rare

435
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:54,981
Pokémon around this area...

436
00:22:54,981 --> 00:22:57,070
Well
I hadn't heard about that.

437
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,159
An extremely
rare Pokémon?

438
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,770
Since I'm already
at the Wind Festival, I was

439
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,119
hoping I could catch it.

440
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,164
Heard of this before?

441
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:05,208
No...

442
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,253
Seriously?

443
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:07,297
I wanna catch it!

444
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:08,386
Wonder what Pokémon it is!

445
00:23:09,952 --> 00:23:10,953
We'd like
to thank Callahan, our winner,

446
00:23:10,953 --> 00:23:12,128
for his time!

447
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,217
Thank you!

448
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:16,219
The Pokémon Channel!

449
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:17,830
I've got a late-breaking,

450
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,484
important newsflash!

451
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:21,355
There's an extremely

452
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:23,009
rare Pokémon in Fula City!

453
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:24,184
If you're
a Pokémon Trainer, you can't

454
00:23:24,184 --> 00:23:26,491
let this chance pass you by!

455
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,682
Maybe
I'm imagining things...

456
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:51,516
I wanna play
more with Uncle Callahan...

457
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:53,474
Little miss
is talking in her sleep.

458
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,869
She did run all over
the place. She's exhausted.

459
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:57,783
That's fine with me.

460
00:23:59,393 --> 00:24:02,483
Wait.
What are you doing following us?

461
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,879
Now
don't give me that!

462
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,924
I returned
all the Pokémon I caught!

463
00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:11,057
And excuse me,
but I never caught you!

464
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:14,582
You're following
my big brother because

465
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:16,497
you like him, right?

466
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:18,978
Go home!

467
00:24:20,632 --> 00:24:21,894
Why don't you go and
find somebody else to bother?

468
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:28,161
Didn't
you hear a word I said?

469
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:30,337
Oh hey!

470
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:33,558
Did you
like the Wind Festival?

471
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:35,211
It was lots of fun!

472
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:38,127
I rode the roller coaster
and went in the haunted house...

473
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:39,389
What about you?

474
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:41,957
I was very busy today.

475
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:44,743
The man who won the
catch race said something

476
00:24:44,743 --> 00:24:47,702
about a rare Pokémon
being in the area, but...

477
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:52,794
Some story! I haven't
heard one word about that.

478
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:55,928
But...weren't there
stories about Zeraora?

479
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,104
Now, Margo.
It doesn't exist anymore.

480
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,890
Father?

481
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,414
We can't have
our citizens panicking!

482
00:25:04,414 --> 00:25:06,547
I want no
more talk of this!

483
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:07,548
Yes, Father...

484
00:25:13,685 --> 00:25:15,948
Oh, come on! Where's
this thing supposed to be?!

485
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:21,910
Would you
stop scaring me?!

486
00:25:26,088 --> 00:25:30,223
Hey, you! Don't you
know this mountain's off limits!

487
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:32,878
You've heard of
Zeraora's curse, haven't you?

488
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:36,316
Now wait just a second!
Zeraora? Curse?

489
00:25:36,316 --> 00:25:38,187
You're not
from around here are ya...

490
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:40,973
Anyway, it's forbidden
to be here, so let's go.

491
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:45,020
Fine, I'll come! Just
tell me, okay? This Pokémon...

492
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,023
I hear it's rare.
You know it?

493
00:25:48,023 --> 00:25:51,157
Rare? Really?
Looks like just an Eevee to me.

494
00:25:51,157 --> 00:25:52,898
They don't
live around these parts.

495
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:56,728
That old man lied
to me through his teeth!

496
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:02,255
You scamps! How did you
get in here in the first place?!

497
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,045
This one is
off limits! You got that?

498
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,571
Stay away from me!!

499
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:26,801
You worked hard,
didn't you, Staryu?

500
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,891
But thanks
to your work, it seems

501
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:30,805
we'll get through tomorrow.

502
00:26:37,116 --> 00:26:40,249
That man is extremely
good at performance, isn't he?

503
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:43,383
So the presentation
should go well.

504
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:46,604
So, Meowth, what kind
of research is he doing?

505
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,301
Let's see...

506
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:51,565
It looks like research
on Pokémon Abilities and moves.

507
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:54,524
Perfect! I mean,
I have no idea what it means,

508
00:26:54,524 --> 00:26:55,961
but it's got to help!

509
00:27:02,794 --> 00:27:04,665
All right.
Let's do some stealing!

510
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:05,710
Yeah...

511
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:11,063
Is, uh, somebody there?

512
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:19,462
Hey, everyone!
Wait, please!

513
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:25,860
So. This is all it was.

514
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,122
Everyone,
careful of the glass.

515
00:27:29,472 --> 00:27:31,344
This is the essence
we made from Smeargle ink.

516
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,477
I wonder
why it fell down.

517
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:40,527
That was close!

518
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:41,659
I panicked.

519
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,922
There's
always another day.

520
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,756
Imagine, there might be
Pokémon we've never heard of

521
00:27:51,756 --> 00:27:54,323
before living somewhere
around this place, you know?

522
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:11,036
Oh, yes...

523
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:13,299
Those scamps
forced me to sleep outside...

524
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:26,355
So what do
you wanna do today?

525
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:27,443
Buddy?

526
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:40,456
I found you!

527
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:42,154
You found me?
Whaddaya mean?

528
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,033
Pikachu's sorry about that.

529
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:54,122
No problem.
Ancient history!

530
00:28:54,122 --> 00:28:56,298
I'm just so glad
the second-place winner in

531
00:28:56,298 --> 00:28:57,735
the catch race can help me!

532
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:59,345
Hope I don't let you down.

533
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,043
You see, my last
"big helper just fed me

534
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:02,957
nothing but lies!

535
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:10,051
You're the best, Pikachu!

536
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:18,277
That's the one!

537
00:29:19,582 --> 00:29:20,583
Before you can catch it,
you battle it.

538
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:22,107
What Pokémon do you have?

539
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:23,412
I don't have any.

540
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:24,587
You don't, huh?

541
00:29:24,587 --> 00:29:26,546
'Kay!o you mind, Pikachu?

542
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,418
So now...

543
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:30,506
...you go take it on!

544
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:33,988
You're kidding!

545
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:38,210
I can't!

546
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:43,998
Sorry, Pikachu!

547
00:29:45,434 --> 00:29:49,003
Just keep calm!
Now listen! Watch Eevee closely!

548
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:50,831
All right!

549
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,008
Pikachu, dodge it!

550
00:29:55,096 --> 00:29:56,663
Risa! Call a Quick Attack!

551
00:29:56,663 --> 00:29:57,751
Use Quick Attack!

552
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:06,194
Do it!
Throw the Poké Ball now!

553
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:07,456
Right. Got it!

554
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,764
Go!

555
00:30:19,338 --> 00:30:20,687
Tough break! Try again!

556
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:21,775
Right!

557
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:27,215
Now Iron Tail!

558
00:30:27,215 --> 00:30:28,303
Iron Tail, go!

559
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,656
Now Thunderbolt!

560
00:30:33,656 --> 00:30:34,701
Use Thunderbolt!

561
00:30:42,578 --> 00:30:44,406
Risa!

562
00:30:44,406 --> 00:30:46,191
Here we go!

563
00:30:58,812 --> 00:31:00,683
Good for you, Risa!

564
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:02,903
Does that
mean I caught it?

565
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,209
Yup!

566
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,736
All right! All right!
I just caught myself an Eevee!

567
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:13,348
Thank you, Ash, Pikachu!

568
00:31:14,523 --> 00:31:15,873
Where are your eyebrows?!

569
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,403
Thanks for waiting.

570
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:27,885
Hey, let's see Eevee!

571
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,115
I'm Risa.
Can we be friends?

572
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:45,685
You'll see!
You'll be friends in no time!

573
00:31:53,998 --> 00:31:57,001
This was the first time
I ever caught a Pokémon.

574
00:31:57,001 --> 00:32:00,874
This feeling. I haven't
felt passion in so long!

575
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:02,658
Right? Fun, isn't it?

576
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:04,965
I've been training
in track and field since

577
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,273
I was little. I had no idea
I could catch a Pokémon!

578
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:11,493
Awesome!
Then you're quick on your feet?

579
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:14,540
This might surprise you,
but I was the regional champion.

580
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,455
That's awesome!

581
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:17,543
But then...

582
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:18,631
I gave it up.

583
00:32:18,631 --> 00:32:20,502
Why's that?

584
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:23,679
I got injured. It's healed
up good as new now, though.

585
00:32:24,593 --> 00:32:26,378
Whoa...

586
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,162
I suddenly
got scared to run.

587
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:36,562
I think now that
Eevee's here, you'll

588
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:37,911
be able to run again.

589
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:39,739
How come?

590
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:41,262
I mean...

591
00:32:41,262 --> 00:32:44,222
What you can't do on
your own, you can do with a

592
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:46,398
Pokémon pal there by your side!

593
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,880
Really?

594
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:58,279
Officer Jenny?
What's wrong?

595
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,850
Hey, Professor!

596
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,462
What? What do you want?
It's early in the morning.

597
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:10,161
I want to know
how you explain them!

598
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:14,121
By them,
do you mean these Pokémon?

599
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:16,384
They've been
acting strange ever since

600
00:33:16,384 --> 00:33:17,907
I came here yesterday!

601
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:20,432
Ah, yesterday's
chemical spill...

602
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,087
Of course that spill was
the essence of a Pokémon move

603
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:25,306
that we call Sweet Scent.

604
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:29,049
Pokémon love the smell,
so they gather around...

605
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,486
What kind of
useless chemical is that?!

606
00:33:31,486 --> 00:33:34,185
I don't want any
Pokémon anywhere near me!

607
00:33:34,185 --> 00:33:36,665
I want that
stuff neutralized, now!

608
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:38,928
Wait. I'm afraid...
I have nothing prepared...

609
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:41,105
Toren!

610
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:43,411
There's trouble!

611
00:33:43,411 --> 00:33:45,109
We just got word from
the festival admin!

612
00:33:48,808 --> 00:33:51,680
There are
signs of tampering with the

613
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,379
attractions' electrical systems,
detergent spilled around town...

614
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:57,121
...and reports
of other minor vandalism.

615
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:59,601
I can't believe someone
would do something like this?

616
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,915
Hey! YOU!

617
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:11,526
Because of you,
I spent all night...

618
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:12,919
Look, I'm sorry!

619
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:15,313
I improvised. See?
My niece is right over there,

620
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:17,228
so give me a break, okay?

621
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:18,185
Pretty please?

622
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,449
I'm begging here!

623
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:24,539
People like you
end up in deep trouble.

624
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:27,238
I know you! You
caught the Pokémon you wanted!

625
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:29,457
Right, thanks
to your cool uncle here!

626
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:34,201
Everyone my apologies!

627
00:34:34,201 --> 00:34:36,203
We'll make an
announcement when we're able

628
00:34:36,203 --> 00:34:37,813
to reopen the festival.

629
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:39,641
We ask for
your continued patience.

630
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:41,208
I guess it can't be helped.

631
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,905
Let's head
back to the hotel and wait.

632
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,038
Mr. Mayor?

633
00:34:45,038 --> 00:34:46,213
We can help out, too!

634
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:47,301
Hey, it's Ash!

635
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:48,737
Margo!

636
00:34:48,737 --> 00:34:51,653
Fascinating! You two
already know each other?

637
00:34:51,653 --> 00:34:53,264
We met in town yesterday.

638
00:34:53,264 --> 00:34:55,527
When you said,
We'll help out, you weren't

639
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,137
signing me up, right?

640
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,879
Sure, the sooner the city
goes back to normal and the

641
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:01,402
festival starts, the better!

642
00:35:01,402 --> 00:35:04,144
Come on! Can we
PLEASE help out, too?

643
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:07,800
It would be great to
receive aid from both the catch

644
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,367
race winner and the runner-up!

645
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:10,629
Yikes.

646
00:35:10,629 --> 00:35:11,934
Uh...

647
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:13,675
I actually can't stay.

648
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:15,938
I have a speaking
engagement at an important

649
00:35:15,938 --> 00:35:17,592
research conference.

650
00:35:18,898 --> 00:35:21,074
Why would you go to
a research conference?

651
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:23,032
Uh...
See, it's like this...

652
00:35:23,032 --> 00:35:27,124
Liar. I feel so sorry
for your little niece.

653
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:30,910
I'll stay quiet...but
you'd just better help out!

654
00:35:32,651 --> 00:35:35,219
All right. You win!

655
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:37,221
Awesome. Let's do it!

656
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,973
Now they've
added another one.

657
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:52,279
There, there you go.

658
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:55,848
Professor?

659
00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:57,371
Don't you have a
research presentation today?

660
00:35:57,371 --> 00:35:58,242
Yes.

661
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:04,987
The Pokémon Channel!

662
00:36:04,987 --> 00:36:06,641
Time
again for the Pokémon Channel!

663
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:08,382
Day two of the Wind Festival

664
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:09,383
was marked by chaos!

665
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:10,993
Ding!

666
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:12,995
Somebody
played a bunch of pranks,

667
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:14,649
threatening the
festival's opening...

668
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:16,434
...but the vendors and

669
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:19,350
townspeople are working very
hard to reopen the festival!

670
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,960
So don't you worry!

671
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:28,141
Man, why do we have
to be on cleanup detail?

672
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:30,143
It's gotta
be Zeraora's curse!

673
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:35,104
It's you guys!

674
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:38,020
Hey you! Tell us
what Zeraora's curse is!

675
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,761
You don't know?

676
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:42,721
When Zeraora vanished
during the fire fifty years ago,

677
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:44,549
the whole mountain was cursed!

678
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:47,029
If a human sets
one foot onto the mountain,

679
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:48,596
it'll bring disaster!

680
00:36:48,596 --> 00:36:50,946
And that's
Zeraora's curse!

681
00:36:50,946 --> 00:36:52,252
It's a lie!

682
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,993
It's just not true!

683
00:36:53,993 --> 00:36:55,908
Hey, Margo...
What's wrong?

684
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,653
This is a message
from festival administration.

685
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:05,091
Since we've met safety
standards in all locations...

686
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:07,833
We hereby reopen
the Wind Festival!

687
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:10,401
Thank goodness, buddy!

688
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:11,228
It went a lot faster
with everybody pitching in.

689
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,708
Goody, goody!

690
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:15,797
We've got
an emergency situation...

691
00:37:15,797 --> 00:37:17,712
Let's clean up what's
left in one shot, okay!

692
00:37:19,192 --> 00:37:20,454
Thank goodness!

693
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:21,977
Let's get the
presentation ready!

694
00:37:21,977 --> 00:37:23,196
All right!

695
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:24,415
Professor?

696
00:37:24,415 --> 00:37:25,764
Another one's
joined the group!

697
00:37:27,156 --> 00:37:28,375
Can't you be a
little quicker about this?

698
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,814
I'm about to be buried
in an avalanche of Pokémon!

699
00:37:32,814 --> 00:37:35,817
Forgive me. I'll find a
solution before that happens.

700
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:37,863
Right after
my presentation!

701
00:37:37,863 --> 00:37:39,256
I'm counting on it!

702
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:51,311
Wow! The cable
car's working again, too!

703
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,139
Our work here is done.

704
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:56,534
Oh, no!

705
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:02,191
Where did my uncle go?

706
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,895
He's acting strange!
I'll bet he did this!

707
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:11,200
He did not!

708
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,201
Let's follow him anyway!

709
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:13,246
Right!

710
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:17,990
Where is he?

711
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,165
'Scuse . Toren...

712
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:20,253
It's time.

713
00:38:20,253 --> 00:38:22,037
Yeah.

714
00:38:22,037 --> 00:38:24,083
Here's the image
data for the presentation.

715
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,214
Thanks.

716
00:38:25,214 --> 00:38:27,042
Are you going
to be all right?

717
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:29,741
I'll manage somehow...

718
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:32,396
Says it all.

719
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:03,775
So...

720
00:39:07,996 --> 00:39:09,520
Um...

721
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,869
Let's see...

722
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:12,958
Just do your best!
You can do this.

723
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,526
I...want to thank you...
Thank you...for coming...

724
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:21,706
Pull yourself together!
You're a scientist!

725
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:24,491
Today we w-wish to present...

726
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:27,494
our Pokémon r-research...

727
00:39:27,494 --> 00:39:28,626
What's wrong with him?

728
00:39:28,626 --> 00:39:29,627
Stage fright?

729
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,021
This...research...is...
the product...of a lot of hard

730
00:39:33,021 --> 00:39:34,196
work and...uh...late...nights...

731
00:39:34,196 --> 00:39:35,459
Uh-oh! I'm too late...

732
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,461
Callahan?

733
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:40,159
What business do
you have coming here?

734
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,247
Um, well...

735
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:42,291
Of...

736
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:44,468
Toren! The visuals, now!

737
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:45,469
Right!

738
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:46,861
This is just great!

739
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:49,342
There aren't more of you,
are there?

740
00:39:57,872 --> 00:40:00,484
Catch this one and
you'll be in first place!

741
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:01,659
Cyndaquil is weak
against water, so use Water Gun!

742
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:02,703
Got it!

743
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:03,791
Use Water Gun!

744
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:10,711
Yes!

745
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:13,584
Now I won't
let Kellie down!

746
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:16,151
My niece will think
I really am a great Trainer!

747
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,327
Callahan?

748
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:20,199
What was that all about?

749
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:22,897
Uh...eh...uh...

750
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:26,771
Uncle...

751
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,076
Is that...

752
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:30,818
No. Um. that's, uh...

753
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:32,690
Did you... tell a lie?

754
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:43,222
I got you! Who are you?

755
00:40:43,222 --> 00:40:45,485
Prepare for trouble!
We're the best.

756
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,748
And make it double,
while forgetting the rest.

757
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:49,968
Just shut your yaps,
we're hard-pressed!

758
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:53,188
But still the best!

759
00:40:53,188 --> 00:40:54,842
Back to the nest...

760
00:40:56,627 --> 00:40:58,367
Uncle Callahan, I...

761
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:00,108
...HATE YOU!!

762
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:01,458
Kellie, wait!

763
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:05,287
Kellie!

764
00:41:05,287 --> 00:41:06,245
Are you all right?

765
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,553
JESSIE/JAMES/We're off!

766
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:10,771
Robbers!

767
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:12,033
The robbers
are getting away!

768
00:41:14,122 --> 00:41:15,602
Team Rocket?!

769
00:41:15,602 --> 00:41:16,690
Let's go, Pikachu!

770
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,486
Eevee? Eevee?

771
00:41:34,621 --> 00:41:36,275
Eevee!

772
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:37,798
Oh, no! What'll I do?!

773
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:40,671
Eevee! Hang in there!
Eevee!

774
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:42,499
Let me see!

775
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:43,717
Is it...

776
00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:45,327
It's fine.
No need to worry.

777
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:47,068
Chansey, use Heal Pulse!

778
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:51,986
You'll be fine, Eevee!

779
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:55,903
Stop right there,
Team Rocket!

780
00:41:55,903 --> 00:41:57,078
It's the Twerp!

781
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:58,384
He's everywhere!

782
00:42:00,473 --> 00:42:01,518
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

783
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:04,825
Wobbuffet, take it!

784
00:42:20,406 --> 00:42:21,494
Eevee!

785
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,628
Eevee's
all right now.

786
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,586
Speedy
first aid helped a lot.

787
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,850
Eevee's leg still
hurts a bit, but just be sure

788
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:34,115
not to aggravate it and
allow it plenty of rest.

789
00:42:34,115 --> 00:42:35,290
Thank you very much.

790
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:45,823
How's Kellie?

791
00:42:45,823 --> 00:42:48,565
The doctor just
finished examining her.

792
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:52,090
She's never had
the best energy or stamina.

793
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,657
I guess the
last couple of days

794
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:54,745
have taken their toll.

795
00:42:54,745 --> 00:42:57,138
I'm so sorry.
I'm responsible.

796
00:42:57,138 --> 00:43:00,185
No. It was my fault
for lying to her all the time.

797
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:08,454
How'd it go?

798
00:43:08,454 --> 00:43:10,717
No luck.
I'm afraid we lost them.

799
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:13,546
Wait is Eevee hurt?!

800
00:43:13,546 --> 00:43:16,723
Yeah. It got caught in the
panicked crowd after you left...

801
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:19,247
But now, Nurse Joy's
treatment helped out a lot.

802
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:20,640
It'll be fine.

803
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,033
I'm glad.

804
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,035
That Team Rocket...

805
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:26,994
I'm afraid what Team
Rocket stole was Effect Spore.

806
00:43:26,994 --> 00:43:28,430
What about Officer Jenny?

807
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,823
I filed a report.

808
00:43:29,823 --> 00:43:31,956
She told me that she
was going to investigate.

809
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:37,309
I'm sure we're tired.
What a day.

810
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:38,266
Let's get some rest.

811
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,239
How's Kellie?

812
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,936
She's sleeping.

813
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:59,374
I'm thinking of taking
her back home with me tomorrow.

814
00:43:59,374 --> 00:44:00,462
I see.

815
00:44:01,463 --> 00:44:02,508
Where are you going?

816
00:44:03,596 --> 00:44:04,902
I don't know.

817
00:44:04,902 --> 00:44:08,383
But Kellie doesn't want
to see my face anymore.

818
00:44:08,383 --> 00:44:10,864
Not after
I let her down.

819
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:17,654
You big idiot.

820
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:28,839
Don't follow me.
Go away!

821
00:44:30,231 --> 00:44:33,713
It isn't
like you're my partner...

822
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,629
You're throwing words
I said to you back in my face,

823
00:44:36,629 --> 00:44:38,283
and I deserve it!

824
00:44:38,283 --> 00:44:41,025
I'm giving
up lying forever.

825
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:43,375
There's no
point in following me.

826
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,116
Go someplace else.
Anywhere.

827
00:44:53,472 --> 00:44:57,302
I told all of you over
and over not to follow me!

828
00:44:57,302 --> 00:44:58,607
I'm not
putting up with it!

829
00:44:59,347 --> 00:45:01,480
Enough.

830
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,090
It's
better being alone!

831
00:45:09,357 --> 00:45:10,881
If I had tried to run...

832
00:45:13,187 --> 00:45:14,798
...I could've
protected you...

833
00:45:16,669 --> 00:45:17,714
Understood.

834
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:18,758
Well done.

835
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,195
Hey, Father?

836
00:45:21,195 --> 00:45:22,327
Margo!

837
00:45:22,327 --> 00:45:24,111
What about
the Wind Festival?

838
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:26,810
The committee just
decided to reopen tomorrow.

839
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,028
We'll tighten security,

840
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:30,422
and any safety concerns
will be addressed.

841
00:45:30,422 --> 00:45:32,380
That's great. I'm glad!

842
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,643
No need to worry at all.

843
00:45:34,643 --> 00:45:36,907
We'll call
on Lugia tomorrow.

844
00:45:36,907 --> 00:45:38,604
Night, Father!

845
00:45:38,604 --> 00:45:39,648
Night!

846
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,355
JESSIE/JAMES/To us!

847
00:46:36,357 --> 00:46:37,924
Okay, let's see it!

848
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:41,580
But I thought you had it!

849
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,582
But I gave it to Meowth.

850
00:46:43,582 --> 00:46:45,497
My paws never
even touched it!

851
00:46:45,497 --> 00:46:47,107
I gave it to you!

852
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:49,588
I called you and did
a behind-the-back flip thing.

853
00:46:49,588 --> 00:46:52,591
Genius, I was running
in front of you the whole time!

854
00:46:52,591 --> 00:46:53,635
Egads!

855
00:46:53,635 --> 00:46:54,811
That means...

856
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:58,205
Then who
did I fling it to?

857
00:46:58,205 --> 00:46:59,859
HORRORS!!

858
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:02,470
Did I fling
it to a Ghost type?!

859
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,232
Now what's
going on here?

860
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:26,668
Never
seen that before...

861
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,639
Risa?

862
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:42,597
Hi. It sounds like
there's trouble outside, Ash.

863
00:47:46,384 --> 00:47:48,168
Ash, up there!

864
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:50,562
The windmill...

865
00:47:50,562 --> 00:47:52,564
They say the winds have died

866
00:47:52,564 --> 00:47:54,479
down because the eternal
flame is gone!

867
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:56,524
Gone?
As in completely?

868
00:47:56,524 --> 00:47:58,091
Yeah.

869
00:47:58,091 --> 00:47:59,919
This isn't just
about the festival, is it?

870
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,619
The eternal flame?

871
00:48:05,707 --> 00:48:06,708
Come on!

872
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,322
Honestly!
Why do we have to do this?

873
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,193
Whose fault
does he think it is that

874
00:48:13,193 --> 00:48:14,455
the presentation was a bust?

875
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:15,761
He'll hear you.

876
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:17,763
I knew we
should've never released

877
00:48:17,763 --> 00:48:20,418
our results with his!
It would've been better.

878
00:48:20,418 --> 00:48:23,203
Next time, say
something before we all meet up!

879
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:24,944
Enough of
that kind of talk!

880
00:48:26,685 --> 00:48:29,340
There's no one who's
more concerned about the

881
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,559
welfare of Pokémon than Toren.

882
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:34,301
Which one of you loves
Pokémon more than Toren?

883
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:36,390
Does anyone know
more about them than he does?

884
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,479
Anyone?!

885
00:48:38,479 --> 00:48:41,700
I think the one thing
needed in Pokémon research...

886
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,180
...is what he gives.

887
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,138
More than any
of the rest of us.

888
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,231
They say the wind died.

889
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:52,537
Hey what's going on?

890
00:48:57,803 --> 00:48:59,848
Kellie,
are you feeling all right?

891
00:49:01,546 --> 00:49:02,851
Where's my uncle?

892
00:49:02,851 --> 00:49:05,158
He said he was going home.

893
00:49:06,464 --> 00:49:08,422
I think...

894
00:49:08,422 --> 00:49:09,946
...I said
something bad to him.

895
00:49:10,816 --> 00:49:12,078
Kellie...

896
00:49:12,078 --> 00:49:13,558
It's all right.

897
00:49:13,558 --> 00:49:16,517
Now cheer up! Your uncle
doesn't mind at all!

898
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:22,959
Mr. Mayor!

899
00:49:23,872 --> 00:49:25,004
It's Ash.

900
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,397
I heard the
eternal flame is out!

901
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:27,398
Yes.

902
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:28,790
And that's why the wind...

903
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:31,750
Lugia sends it
toward the eternal flame.

904
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,186
But now...

905
00:49:33,186 --> 00:49:35,449
Does that mean
that Lugia doesn't know where

906
00:49:35,449 --> 00:49:36,885
to send the wind anymore?

907
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:38,496
Yes.

908
00:49:38,496 --> 00:49:41,064
We need the eternal
flame. By the end of the night.

909
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:42,804
No later than dawn tomorrow.

910
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:44,589
Without the wind,
the city will eventually

911
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:46,156
run out of power.

912
00:49:46,156 --> 00:49:47,418
No way...

913
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:49,028
Do you mind if
I take a closer look?

914
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:50,116
Go.

915
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:57,210
I'm really afraid
of high places!

916
00:50:04,478 --> 00:50:05,566
What's up, buddy?

917
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:07,786
You figured something out!

918
00:50:07,786 --> 00:50:09,744
Us, too?!

919
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:14,314
Good! It's nice and lively!

920
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:15,446
We can sell every one

921
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,013
of these for a good price!

922
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:20,146
Pokémon
hunting is a good thing...

923
00:50:20,146 --> 00:50:22,366
Love the great outdoors!

924
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,939
It's Pikachu.

925
00:50:30,939 --> 00:50:32,289
Pikachu!

926
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:34,291
The crook that
stole the eternal flame...

927
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:35,901
Is that Smeargle?

928
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:38,382
Eternal flame?

929
00:50:38,382 --> 00:50:39,774
Yeah, it's been stolen.

930
00:50:39,774 --> 00:50:41,689
Pikachu has been
following the scent and

931
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:42,864
it led straight here.

932
00:50:42,864 --> 00:50:44,649
Right here to Smeargle.

933
00:50:44,649 --> 00:50:45,693
Smeargle's scent...

934
00:50:46,912 --> 00:50:49,523
You mean Smeargle ink?

935
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:53,049
It can't be...

936
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:56,748
I initially thought
it just slid off the table,

937
00:50:56,748 --> 00:50:57,879
but now...

938
00:50:57,879 --> 00:51:00,186
Somebody stole it!

939
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:02,841
I can't be sure,
but if that's what happened...

940
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:09,630
You see, Smeargle uses
its ink to mark its territory.

941
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:12,894
I thought I can use it
for marking, but the chemical

942
00:51:12,894 --> 00:51:15,245
is invisible after
distilling its essence.

943
00:51:15,245 --> 00:51:17,290
Except this
light reveals it.

944
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:22,600
There. Case in point.

945
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,601
Incredible.

946
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:24,776
You did it, Pikachu!

947
00:51:26,256 --> 00:51:28,040
If we follow these,
it should lead us straight

948
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,302
to the culprit.

949
00:51:29,302 --> 00:51:30,303
Then let's go!

950
00:51:41,271 --> 00:51:42,707
Wonder if it's
been called off.

951
00:51:44,448 --> 00:51:46,102
It's all right!

952
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,494
I'll protect
you this time.

953
00:51:53,283 --> 00:51:54,675
Huh...

954
00:51:54,675 --> 00:51:56,199
Who knew there was a place

955
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:58,592
like this in Fula City?

956
00:51:58,592 --> 00:52:00,551
Let's hurry
up and find that rare Pokémon!

957
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:02,118
There are a lot of Trainers

958
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,554
who saw that video...

959
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:04,729
Yeah.

960
00:52:04,729 --> 00:52:06,557
Zeraora,
they're after it!

961
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:10,735
Hey, there!

962
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:13,041
What are you two guys doing
all the way out here?

963
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,653
Hi, little
girl! You from Fula City?

964
00:52:15,653 --> 00:52:17,350
Have you ever seen any Pokémon

965
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,438
you don't see anywhere else?

966
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:19,526
Sure I have!

967
00:52:19,526 --> 00:52:20,527
You mean it?

968
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:21,572
So where?!

969
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:23,487
Uh...that way!

970
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:25,228
I never saw one like it!

971
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:27,055
Thanks for
your help, sweet heart!

972
00:52:27,055 --> 00:52:28,492
You're welcome. Any time.

973
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:35,194
What's that?

974
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,717
A Ditto and a Teddiursa.

975
00:52:36,717 --> 00:52:38,676
No don't!!

976
00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:43,289
If you don't hurry,
that rare Pokémon will get away!

977
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:44,290
Quick!

978
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:46,858
We'll just take these two first.

979
00:52:46,858 --> 00:52:47,859
Houndoom,
go!

980
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:48,816
Go, Sneasel!

981
00:52:53,952 --> 00:52:55,171
Houndoom,
use Flamethrower!!

982
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,084
Sneasel, use Icy Wind!

983
00:53:06,573 --> 00:53:08,619
Hide, Zeraora! Hurry up!

984
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,055
Hey, I've never seen

985
00:53:10,055 --> 00:53:11,230
that Pokémon before!

986
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,362
It's the rare one!

987
00:53:12,362 --> 00:53:13,624
Use Fire Fang!

988
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:14,799
Use Slash!

989
00:53:26,027 --> 00:53:28,073
Zeraora! It's too much!

990
00:53:28,073 --> 00:53:30,075
Your wounds
still haven't healed yet!

991
00:53:30,075 --> 00:53:31,555
Wow, it's fast!

992
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:32,599
Hey but it looks like

993
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:33,905
it's already wounded.

994
00:53:33,905 --> 00:53:36,168
Yeah, now's our chance!

995
00:53:36,168 --> 00:53:37,561
Sneasel, Ice Shard!

996
00:53:43,131 --> 00:53:44,611
All right, Houndoom!

997
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:45,743
Follow that with Flamethrower!

998
00:53:57,407 --> 00:53:58,451
Zeraora!

999
00:53:59,887 --> 00:54:02,847
Zeraora! Wake up!
Zeraora? They'll catch you!!

1000
00:54:02,847 --> 00:54:04,065
Time to wrap this up.

1001
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:15,207
What?!

1002
00:54:17,992 --> 00:54:19,342
You okay, Margo?

1003
00:54:20,778 --> 00:54:22,867
You were awesome
all by yourself.

1004
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:23,824
Ash, you're here...

1005
00:54:25,435 --> 00:54:26,871
Father...

1006
00:54:26,871 --> 00:54:28,264
Everyone...

1007
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:30,353
I am the
mayor of Fula City!

1008
00:54:30,353 --> 00:54:32,137
Choose
your next move wisely,

1009
00:54:32,137 --> 00:54:34,531
or I'll take legal action!

1010
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:35,662
What do you think?

1011
00:54:35,662 --> 00:54:36,446
I think we leave.

1012
00:54:39,187 --> 00:54:40,537
Hey, you!

1013
00:54:40,537 --> 00:54:42,495
Following
them would be dumb!

1014
00:54:42,495 --> 00:54:43,453
Stay here.

1015
00:54:47,065 --> 00:54:48,588
Oh, Father...

1016
00:54:48,588 --> 00:54:51,722
It isn't Zeraora's fault!
I did everything!

1017
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:54,594
That's Zeraora?

1018
00:54:54,594 --> 00:54:55,726
Yeah.

1019
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:57,336
The stories
said it vanished.

1020
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,946
But there it is,
in the flesh.

1021
00:55:03,124 --> 00:55:04,430
This is it...isn't it?

1022
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:09,783
Do you have any idea how
much trouble you have caused?

1023
00:55:09,783 --> 00:55:10,741
For everyone.

1024
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:13,439
Margo...

1025
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:19,706
It's only been a little
while since I first met Zeraora.

1026
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:21,534
I was playing with
the Pokémon in the foothills

1027
00:55:21,534 --> 00:55:22,970
of the mountain...

1028
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:24,929
Suddenly,
there was a rockslide.

1029
00:55:27,714 --> 00:55:31,065
I should have been
crushed by that boulder.

1030
00:55:31,065 --> 00:55:34,634
Zeraora is the one
who protected me back then.

1031
00:55:34,634 --> 00:55:38,595
But by doing that,
Zeraora was badly hurt!

1032
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:42,425
It was all my fault!

1033
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:46,385
So I vowed to
help make it well again!

1034
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:50,128
Everybody in town
seems to be so afraid of it.

1035
00:55:50,128 --> 00:55:52,478
I thought that at
least I could be its friend...

1036
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:55,786
...and take care of it
until it was all better again.

1037
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:58,832
But then they said
someone knew of a rare Pokémon.

1038
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,014
And I knew...that
everybody would try to catch it.

1039
00:56:07,014 --> 00:56:09,495
That's when...I thought
that if the Wind Festival

1040
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:11,715
was called off...

1041
00:56:11,715 --> 00:56:13,891
I knew it would
cause problems if the eternal

1042
00:56:13,891 --> 00:56:15,632
flame was taken...

1043
00:56:15,632 --> 00:56:17,373
But I was gonna
put it back the minute the

1044
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:19,113
festival was canceled!

1045
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:26,599
I'm sorry!
I'm really, really sorry!

1046
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,514
Margo...

1047
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:35,086
Margo...

1048
00:56:35,086 --> 00:56:38,481
Thank you
for protecting Zeraora.

1049
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:40,874
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

1050
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,051
Regarding
the truth about Zeraora.

1051
00:56:46,184 --> 00:56:49,709
Zeraora lived in
this area for a long time.

1052
00:56:49,709 --> 00:56:53,409
It was master of
the land, beloved by Pokémon.

1053
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,802
And they
all lived in peace.

1054
00:56:55,802 --> 00:56:57,848
So what did we humans do?

1055
00:56:57,848 --> 00:57:01,199
We cut down the forests
that were home to the Pokémon...

1056
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:04,071
Looking
to enrich our lives.

1057
00:57:04,071 --> 00:57:06,900
The reason for the
mountain fire? We did it.

1058
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,467
That was fifty short years ago.

1059
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,037
No way...

1060
00:57:13,037 --> 00:57:14,908
Fire was everywhere!

1061
00:57:14,908 --> 00:57:17,563
And people never
thought for a moment of

1062
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:18,912
the wild Pokémon living there.

1063
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:23,134
Everyone was in a panic.

1064
00:57:23,134 --> 00:57:26,572
But Zeraora was the only
one who never gave up on saving

1065
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:28,835
the many Pokémon left behind.

1066
00:57:28,835 --> 00:57:31,316
Ever since,
Zeraora has been deeply

1067
00:57:31,316 --> 00:57:34,058
angry with humankind.

1068
00:57:34,058 --> 00:57:36,060
I see. That's why.

1069
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:39,542
You see, people
did things that made Zeraora

1070
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:40,978
trust them less and less.

1071
00:57:40,978 --> 00:57:44,111
All Zeraora wanted
was to live in peace

1072
00:57:44,111 --> 00:57:45,896
with the forest Pokémon.

1073
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:49,203
But huge numbers
of Trainers gathered in

1074
00:57:49,203 --> 00:57:50,944
the forest to catch Zeraora!

1075
00:57:53,425 --> 00:57:55,383
The previous mayor,
wishing to make up for

1076
00:57:55,383 --> 00:57:58,299
this injustice, decided
to lie to the townspeople.

1077
00:57:58,299 --> 00:58:01,085
He said that Zeraora had
vanished, and the mountain was

1078
00:58:01,085 --> 00:58:04,958
cursed. He forbade anyone from
entering the mountain again.

1079
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:08,179
He did it hoping to
protect Zeraora. It was the only

1080
00:58:08,179 --> 00:58:10,137
thing people could think to do.

1081
00:58:10,137 --> 00:58:12,052
That explains it...

1082
00:58:12,052 --> 00:58:16,404
Very few people
know about it. Very, very few.

1083
00:58:16,404 --> 00:58:18,319
And even
fewer young people.

1084
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,278
And that's...

1085
00:58:20,278 --> 00:58:22,106
...the truth about Zeraora.

1086
00:58:32,812 --> 00:58:34,422
What was that?

1087
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:37,948
Smoke...

1088
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:40,080
It could be related
to the Wind Festival...

1089
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,517
No.

1090
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:47,827
That doesn't look good...

1091
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:48,741
Here it comes!

1092
00:58:50,003 --> 00:58:50,961
What was that?!

1093
00:58:53,703 --> 00:58:56,009
Oh no...
It just can't be...

1094
00:58:56,009 --> 00:58:58,142
Wait.
Do you know about this?

1095
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:10,110
The color of the
smoke...and these symptoms...

1096
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,243
It's possible
that this is Effect Spore...

1097
00:59:12,243 --> 00:59:13,723
Hey,
Team Rocket stole that!

1098
00:59:14,941 --> 00:59:17,640
Correct. Chansey,
use Aromatherapy.

1099
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:22,470
Tell me about this
Effect Spore... What is it?

1100
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:24,908
I was in the
process of researching it.

1101
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:27,301
Since it's a chemical
version of the Ability, Effect

1102
00:59:27,301 --> 00:59:28,868
Spore, I kept it in a capsule.

1103
00:59:30,261 --> 00:59:31,741
What does that have
to do with these Pidgey?

1104
00:59:33,264 --> 00:59:35,745
When you breathe in
that chemical, it becomes a

1105
00:59:35,745 --> 00:59:37,485
poison that numbs your body.

1106
00:59:37,485 --> 00:59:38,965
That's what the smoke was.

1107
00:59:38,965 --> 00:59:40,706
Why would
you ever make that?

1108
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:43,927
During my research, I
found that it's also effective

1109
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:45,189
against certain human diseases.

1110
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:49,149
Yes, it's me.

1111
00:59:49,149 --> 00:59:50,977
Your Honor,
I have a report.

1112
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:53,501
There's been an
outbreak of an unknown smoke,

1113
00:59:53,501 --> 00:59:55,199
engulfing a quarter
of Fula City.

1114
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:56,679
It's
spreading as we speak.

1115
00:59:56,679 --> 00:59:59,290
Anyone who breathes
it experiences numbness,

1116
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:01,771
so we classified it as a poison.

1117
01:00:01,771 --> 01:00:04,208
We have also
ordered emergency evacuation

1118
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:05,818
of all affected areas.

1119
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:07,211
There's
not a moment to lose!

1120
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:09,126
Please return to the city!

1121
01:00:09,126 --> 01:00:10,214
Understood.

1122
01:00:11,563 --> 01:00:12,956
Oh, no, Father...

1123
01:00:15,523 --> 01:00:16,960
It's all my fault.

1124
01:00:26,709 --> 01:00:30,016
Let's go! Watching
won't help anything!

1125
01:00:30,016 --> 01:00:32,976
So whaddaya say we
go and protect Fula City?!

1126
01:00:35,805 --> 01:00:37,110
Easier said than done,
but how do we do that?

1127
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:39,678
We've all got Pokémon
partners! Right by our sides!

1128
01:00:42,376 --> 01:00:44,378
Whatever you can't do, you
can do it with a Pokémon pal!

1129
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,426
When you're with a Pokémon,
it's like your muscles and your

1130
01:00:48,426 --> 01:00:49,732
mind get a lot stronger!

1131
01:00:49,732 --> 01:00:52,212
And that's
called--Pokémon power!!

1132
01:00:55,738 --> 01:00:58,828
What does
"Pokémon power" mean?

1133
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:03,441
Pokémon power, huh?

1134
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,489
Right. Let's do it!

1135
01:01:08,489 --> 01:01:10,056
That's the spirit!

1136
01:01:10,056 --> 01:01:13,538
Professor, is there
any way to disperse the smoke?

1137
01:01:13,538 --> 01:01:17,542
Now let's see. I could
go back to the lab and produce

1138
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:19,762
large quantities of the
essence of the Pokémon

1139
01:01:19,762 --> 01:01:20,893
Ability Natural Cure...

1140
01:01:20,893 --> 01:01:22,547
But it's no use!

1141
01:01:22,547 --> 01:01:25,419
There's no way to spread
it throughout the city!

1142
01:01:25,419 --> 01:01:27,378
What about
using the wind to do it?

1143
01:01:27,378 --> 01:01:28,640
The wind?

1144
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,250
There's the
old generating station.

1145
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,643
You're right....

1146
01:01:31,643 --> 01:01:33,645
But wait, I thought
that it was broken down.

1147
01:01:33,645 --> 01:01:36,213
Harriet? If you
can't fix it, no one can!

1148
01:01:36,213 --> 01:01:37,214
What do you mean?

1149
01:01:40,826 --> 01:01:43,524
You see,
I built that power plant.

1150
01:01:43,524 --> 01:01:46,266
Granny, that is so cool!

1151
01:01:46,266 --> 01:01:49,922
I built the propeller
so it could run backward, too.

1152
01:01:49,922 --> 01:01:51,837
If you run it in reverse,

1153
01:01:51,837 --> 01:01:53,447
it will cause wind to blow.

1154
01:01:53,447 --> 01:01:56,015
Question is,
will it still spin?

1155
01:01:56,015 --> 01:01:57,451
I give it
a fifty-fifty chance.

1156
01:01:58,322 --> 01:01:59,497
Fifty-fifty?

1157
01:01:59,497 --> 01:02:00,672
Yes! We can do this!

1158
01:02:02,413 --> 01:02:04,371
You scamps
will have to help, too!

1159
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:06,025
We're going to need
some muscle!

1160
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:09,289
Very well.

1161
01:02:09,289 --> 01:02:10,856
Toren and Harriet, you need
to go to the power plant.

1162
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:13,598
Risa, Margo, and I are
going to stay here, and treat

1163
01:02:13,598 --> 01:02:17,471
Zeraora and the wild Pokémon,
then we'll lead them to safety.

1164
01:02:17,471 --> 01:02:19,952
Smoke is heavier
than air, so the tops of

1165
01:02:19,952 --> 01:02:22,172
the mountains should be safe.

1166
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:24,609
And take this.
Super Potion.

1167
01:02:24,609 --> 01:02:26,742
It will help
heal injured Pokémon.

1168
01:02:26,742 --> 01:02:28,439
Thank you, Toren!

1169
01:02:28,439 --> 01:02:29,788
All right, everyone...

1170
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:31,181
Good luck to you!

1171
01:02:33,836 --> 01:02:35,576
Remain calm and orderly!

1172
01:02:35,576 --> 01:02:36,882
Evacuate as quickly as possible!

1173
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:43,889
Mia, where are you?!
Is Kellie all right?!

1174
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:46,283
She's fine.
We're both doing just fine.

1175
01:02:46,283 --> 01:02:48,851
We're on the gondola ride.

1176
01:02:48,851 --> 01:02:51,157
We seem to have
come to an emergency stop.

1177
01:02:51,157 --> 01:02:53,594
It hasn't moved in a while.

1178
01:02:53,594 --> 01:02:56,206
Uncle Callahan! Help us...

1179
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:58,382
Kellie! Mia!

1180
01:03:03,169 --> 01:03:04,083
How can I help them?

1181
01:03:08,609 --> 01:03:10,046
So stupid...

1182
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:14,572
Such a stupid liar!

1183
01:03:23,015 --> 01:03:24,451
I told you to go away...

1184
01:03:27,193 --> 01:03:28,455
What's with you?!

1185
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:33,112
What do
you think we can do?

1186
01:03:33,112 --> 01:03:37,073
All I ever
do is lie, then run away.

1187
01:03:37,073 --> 01:03:39,989
We're weak.
Both of us.

1188
01:03:44,645 --> 01:03:46,909
Hey!
What's that for? Stop!

1189
01:03:49,781 --> 01:03:52,566
But why?

1190
01:04:00,357 --> 01:04:01,271
Sudowoodo...

1191
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:06,842
You're not lying.

1192
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:08,669
You're actually
willing to help me.

1193
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,942
Thank you. Sudowoodo.

1194
01:04:24,468 --> 01:04:26,513
I'm taking back my pledge.

1195
01:04:26,513 --> 01:04:28,994
I'll do
whatever it takes...

1196
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:31,344
If it helps to
keep the ones I love safe!

1197
01:04:33,216 --> 01:04:34,826
Together
we can't be beat!

1198
01:04:36,175 --> 01:04:38,134
We'll save
Kellie and Mia as a team!

1199
01:04:40,788 --> 01:04:43,052
Say what?!
Now you tell me!

1200
01:04:45,532 --> 01:04:46,577
Status!

1201
01:04:46,577 --> 01:04:47,839
Right.

1202
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,406
More than
half the city is already

1203
01:04:49,406 --> 01:04:51,103
engulfed in smoke.

1204
01:04:51,103 --> 01:04:53,627
We are sending
evacuees to the Pokémon Center,

1205
01:04:53,627 --> 01:04:55,673
but it won't be enough.

1206
01:04:55,673 --> 01:04:58,589
Mr. Mayor,
what are our countermeasures?

1207
01:04:58,589 --> 01:04:59,851
We'll use Pokémon power!

1208
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:07,293
Toren!

1209
01:05:07,293 --> 01:05:08,555
Where have you been?

1210
01:05:08,555 --> 01:05:10,514
We've been given
evacuation orders, too.

1211
01:05:10,514 --> 01:05:12,124
I see. Sorry.

1212
01:05:12,124 --> 01:05:14,300
Give us a hand with these
research materials would ya.

1213
01:05:16,172 --> 01:05:17,651
What's the matter?

1214
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:19,740
Toren, are you listening?

1215
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,655
No. I mean...

1216
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:27,879
Pokémon power.

1217
01:05:27,879 --> 01:05:30,273
Pokémon power.
Pokémon power! Pokémon power!

1218
01:05:30,273 --> 01:05:32,101
Toren,
would you hurry, time's up!

1219
01:05:32,101 --> 01:05:34,190
Listen to me, NOW!

1220
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:36,844
I know you all hate me!

1221
01:05:36,844 --> 01:05:40,196
I easily get flustered,
and I can't always speak!

1222
01:05:40,196 --> 01:05:42,850
You probably think
of me as some weirdo!

1223
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:45,114
But right now,
I really need your help!

1224
01:05:45,114 --> 01:05:47,812
There's still a way for
us to save our home!

1225
01:05:47,812 --> 01:05:49,335
I won't run!

1226
01:05:49,335 --> 01:05:51,816
I want to use my research
to save people and Pokémon!

1227
01:05:58,170 --> 01:05:59,171
Toren?

1228
01:05:59,171 --> 01:06:00,172
What?!

1229
01:06:00,172 --> 01:06:01,782
You're always like this.

1230
01:06:01,782 --> 01:06:05,090
Always putting other
people and Pokémon first.

1231
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:06,787
This time is no different.

1232
01:06:06,787 --> 01:06:09,312
I respect you as a researcher.

1233
01:06:09,312 --> 01:06:12,271
So what do you want
us to do? We'll help you.

1234
01:06:12,271 --> 01:06:13,881
Whatever it is,
you know we'll get it done!

1235
01:06:13,881 --> 01:06:15,231
Just say the word.

1236
01:06:15,231 --> 01:06:16,406
Let us know what you need.

1237
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:18,712
You mean it?

1238
01:06:24,109 --> 01:06:26,372
I want to make
massive quantities of the

1239
01:06:26,372 --> 01:06:27,852
essence of Natural Cure!

1240
01:06:27,852 --> 01:06:30,986
You heard him!
Let's get started right away!

1241
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:34,032
There it is! That's the one!

1242
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,555
Where is it hiding?

1243
01:06:35,555 --> 01:06:38,602
Come out, Zeraora!

1244
01:06:38,602 --> 01:06:40,691
Don't let it escape! Catch it!

1245
01:06:43,694 --> 01:06:44,825
All done.

1246
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:47,350
Zeraora, you're awake!

1247
01:06:48,655 --> 01:06:49,743
It's okay.
The bad men are gone now!

1248
01:06:50,744 --> 01:06:51,832
Margo, wait!

1249
01:06:57,969 --> 01:06:59,449
Zeraora, it's okay!

1250
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:00,754
We don't wanna hurt you!

1251
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:11,374
Well, I got it.

1252
01:07:11,374 --> 01:07:12,375
Where's the professor?

1253
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:13,985
He hasn't arrived yet.

1254
01:07:13,985 --> 01:07:17,815
Hey! What do I do
to get rid of all that smoke?!

1255
01:07:17,815 --> 01:07:19,164
Well, it's you!

1256
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:20,557
Granny?

1257
01:07:20,557 --> 01:07:21,819
So, we want to
get the former power plant

1258
01:07:21,819 --> 01:07:23,168
to disperse the poison.

1259
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:24,604
Kellie is in danger!

1260
01:07:24,604 --> 01:07:26,693
So let's get to that
formal whatever it is!

1261
01:07:28,826 --> 01:07:29,914
What was that?

1262
01:07:33,961 --> 01:07:35,485
It's by the transformer.

1263
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:39,576
It could be the
smoke caused a short circuit...

1264
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:42,753
Granny!

1265
01:07:44,972 --> 01:07:46,539
The power's going out...

1266
01:07:49,716 --> 01:07:51,675
We've gotta get
outta here or we're toast!

1267
01:07:51,675 --> 01:07:54,069
Nothing changes, DOES IT?!

1268
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:57,507
Hurry up! Come on!

1269
01:08:02,773 --> 01:08:04,296
We made it...

1270
01:08:04,296 --> 01:08:05,602
It follows
that we're saved...

1271
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:09,736
It's a power outage!

1272
01:08:09,736 --> 01:08:11,347
No, you can't!

1273
01:08:11,347 --> 01:08:14,611
Not after all the work we've
done! Please, I'm begging you...

1274
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:21,400
What is it, Chansey?

1275
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,711
Granny!
Are you all right?!

1276
01:08:27,711 --> 01:08:29,452
Prepare
a bed for her. Quickly!

1277
01:08:29,452 --> 01:08:30,496
Sir!

1278
01:08:30,496 --> 01:08:31,802
Don't bother. I'm fine.

1279
01:08:33,586 --> 01:08:36,328
We can't wait for
the professor, so let's go!

1280
01:08:36,328 --> 01:08:38,809
We'll need time
to get that junk started.

1281
01:08:38,809 --> 01:08:41,986
Okay, then let's go!
I'll take you there!

1282
01:08:41,986 --> 01:08:43,640
Right after toxic smoke

1283
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,642
appeared in town, a power
transformer exploded,

1284
01:08:45,642 --> 01:08:46,730
creating a gigantic
mountain fire!

1285
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:47,861
Here you go.

1286
01:08:47,861 --> 01:08:49,254
Thanks a lot.

1287
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:50,560
The power's out, plunging

1288
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,605
the area into total darkness!

1289
01:08:52,605 --> 01:08:54,477
To everyone in Fula City,

1290
01:08:54,477 --> 01:08:55,826
be careful!

1291
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:03,834
Zeraora?

1292
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:12,538
Where do you think it went?

1293
01:09:12,538 --> 01:09:14,584
It went to rescue
the Pokémon there...

1294
01:09:18,718 --> 01:09:19,850
Wait!

1295
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,894
Risa!

1296
01:09:20,894 --> 01:09:22,548
I'll go after Margo!

1297
01:09:22,548 --> 01:09:24,071
You've gotta get that
back to where it belongs!

1298
01:09:24,071 --> 01:09:25,682
And call Lugia!

1299
01:09:26,552 --> 01:09:28,119
Wait a minute!

1300
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:30,817
Nobody can get it over
there faster than you, Risa!

1301
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,038
It's something
only you can do!

1302
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:37,128
You can do this!

1303
01:09:37,128 --> 01:09:38,173
I know it!

1304
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:40,262
I really can't!

1305
01:09:40,262 --> 01:09:41,263
I mean...

1306
01:09:41,263 --> 01:09:43,090
I can't...

1307
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:45,005
...run anymore...

1308
01:09:49,923 --> 01:09:51,229
Eevee!

1309
01:10:05,069 --> 01:10:08,028
Why do you keep
trying so hard?!

1310
01:10:23,522 --> 01:10:25,350
I mean...

1311
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:28,353
What you can't do on
your own, you can do with a

1312
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:30,703
Pokémon pal there by your side!

1313
01:10:35,012 --> 01:10:37,057
Together...

1314
01:10:41,061 --> 01:10:44,195
With a Pokémon...
I can do anything...

1315
01:10:45,805 --> 01:10:48,982
You showed me just
how determined you are...

1316
01:10:48,982 --> 01:10:50,810
So I have to be the same.

1317
01:10:55,032 --> 01:10:56,642
This time,
it's my turn to try hard!

1318
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:01,778
Let's deliver it.
Together!

1319
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:04,650
Right!

1320
01:11:18,534 --> 01:11:19,622
Come here!

1321
01:11:20,797 --> 01:11:22,059
Now hang on tight...

1322
01:11:25,932 --> 01:11:28,283
Get ready
for our Pokémon power!!

1323
01:11:43,907 --> 01:11:45,169
I've got to think!

1324
01:11:45,169 --> 01:11:47,040
Think! Think!

1325
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,434
I've got the knowledge
if I can just THINK!

1326
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:53,090
I've got to think harder
than anyone in the world!

1327
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,877
Lum Berries? That's it!

1328
01:11:57,877 --> 01:11:58,965
Excuse me!

1329
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:02,142
It's these!
They can do it!

1330
01:12:02,142 --> 01:12:04,144
May I please
have all these berries?

1331
01:12:04,144 --> 01:12:05,581
To save the city!

1332
01:12:07,626 --> 01:12:09,976
Just a little longer...

1333
01:12:09,976 --> 01:12:12,501
It'll be okay.

1334
01:12:12,501 --> 01:12:15,678
Uncle Callahan
will come and save us!

1335
01:12:15,678 --> 01:12:18,463
Got it. So we just
have to get the place running.

1336
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:20,378
Then we use
it to spread out the

1337
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:21,553
professor's chemicals.

1338
01:12:21,553 --> 01:12:22,641
You've got
a way with words.

1339
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:27,342
What's
this supposed to be?

1340
01:12:29,866 --> 01:12:32,825
The only thing we can
do is find a different route.

1341
01:12:32,825 --> 01:12:35,480
But isn't
the old power plant that

1342
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,177
big rusty thing up there?

1343
01:12:37,177 --> 01:12:39,702
Let's spray all
of it and bust through!

1344
01:12:39,702 --> 01:12:40,877
No, you can't!

1345
01:12:40,877 --> 01:12:42,139
I won't permit that!

1346
01:12:43,575 --> 01:12:44,881
What's the matter,
Granny?

1347
01:12:46,839 --> 01:12:48,667
It was this hand...

1348
01:12:48,667 --> 01:12:50,190
If I held
it out a little more...

1349
01:12:52,105 --> 01:12:54,107
YOUNG Snubbull!
Come back here!

1350
01:12:54,107 --> 01:12:55,500
YOUNG Snubbull!!

1351
01:13:00,026 --> 01:13:01,419
YOUNG This way! Hurry!

1352
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:06,424
YOUNG Snubbull!!

1353
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:11,603
I should
never have let it get away!

1354
01:13:11,603 --> 01:13:13,170
Granny!

1355
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:15,868
Get it together!
I don't know about the past...

1356
01:13:15,868 --> 01:13:17,609
...but we're with you now!

1357
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:35,061
Thank you, Snubbull!

1358
01:13:35,061 --> 01:13:37,368
My beloved,
you protected the key.

1359
01:13:37,368 --> 01:13:40,545
You probably did it just
for this very moment!

1360
01:13:40,545 --> 01:13:43,418
So, now it's my turn!

1361
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:46,421
Scamps!
Will you do this with me?

1362
01:13:49,249 --> 01:13:51,469
Then let's all
show 'em what for!

1363
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:52,731
Give 'em
our Pokémon power!!

1364
01:13:58,955 --> 01:14:00,304
Can you hit it
from the air?

1365
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:37,080
Right!

1366
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,429
Whatever
else it may have done,

1367
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:40,039
it managed to open up a path!

1368
01:14:49,092 --> 01:14:50,354
What'll I do?

1369
01:14:50,354 --> 01:14:52,835
If I just keep
running from the smoke,

1370
01:14:52,835 --> 01:14:53,966
I'll never get there!

1371
01:14:55,185 --> 01:14:56,273
Risa!

1372
01:14:56,273 --> 01:14:57,361
Rick?!

1373
01:14:57,361 --> 01:14:59,102
I'll be your navigator!

1374
01:14:59,102 --> 01:15:01,713
I'm searching for a route
to the eternal flame pedestal

1375
01:15:01,713 --> 01:15:03,410
that keeps you out of the smoke!

1376
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:04,977
Found it!

1377
01:15:04,977 --> 01:15:06,413
Why are you doing this?

1378
01:15:06,413 --> 01:15:09,112
Hold on! Just how
do you know where I am?!

1379
01:15:09,112 --> 01:15:10,548
Never mind!
Just keep running!

1380
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:11,810
Right!

1381
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,595
See the woods
in front of you? Go in!

1382
01:15:13,595 --> 01:15:14,987
It should slow down the smoke!

1383
01:15:14,987 --> 01:15:15,945
Right!

1384
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:36,966
Zeraora!

1385
01:15:39,621 --> 01:15:40,709
I knew it!

1386
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:46,497
Look out!!

1387
01:15:49,544 --> 01:15:50,545
I'm all right!

1388
01:15:51,894 --> 01:15:54,723
You hate people, right?

1389
01:15:54,723 --> 01:15:56,333
You can't trust us, right?

1390
01:15:57,464 --> 01:16:01,294
That's
a lonely way to live.

1391
01:16:01,294 --> 01:16:04,776
Don't you think?
So I want to be your friend!

1392
01:16:08,432 --> 01:16:09,912
Yeah...

1393
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:12,958
So stubborn...

1394
01:16:16,179 --> 01:16:17,833
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

1395
01:16:21,576 --> 01:16:23,229
Pikachu, Iron Tail!

1396
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:31,847
Use Quick Attack!

1397
01:16:45,077 --> 01:16:46,383
We did it!

1398
01:16:46,383 --> 01:16:48,951
All right!
We did it, we did it!

1399
01:16:49,908 --> 01:16:51,040
Toren!

1400
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,084
The mayor
sent a car. It's here.

1401
01:16:56,785 --> 01:16:58,264
Your Honor!

1402
01:16:58,264 --> 01:16:59,309
Preparations are complete.

1403
01:17:00,092 --> 01:17:01,093
Good.

1404
01:17:03,487 --> 01:17:05,663
This is
countermeasure headquarters.

1405
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:08,100
We request
everyone evacuate due

1406
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,754
to the Effect Spore smoke.

1407
01:17:09,754 --> 01:17:13,149
If there are any people
or Pokémon that are in need of

1408
01:17:13,149 --> 01:17:16,195
assistance, I'm asking for
those nearby to give them

1409
01:17:16,195 --> 01:17:18,284
whatever assistance they can.

1410
01:17:18,284 --> 01:17:21,723
We have also dispatched
a countermeasures team to help

1411
01:17:21,723 --> 01:17:23,159
solve further problems.

1412
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:25,378
We will spare no
effort to make the citizens

1413
01:17:25,378 --> 01:17:27,642
of our fair city safe again!

1414
01:17:29,469 --> 01:17:31,950
I'd also like to
take this opportunity to

1415
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:33,735
make a request, as mayor.

1416
01:17:33,735 --> 01:17:35,475
The outbreak of
the Effect Spore smoke

1417
01:17:35,475 --> 01:17:37,869
has caused a mountain fire.

1418
01:17:37,869 --> 01:17:40,959
Once our team's plan
is in place, I ask that as

1419
01:17:40,959 --> 01:17:43,658
many of you as possible
please join me...

1420
01:17:43,658 --> 01:17:45,660
...in working to
help us put out the fire.

1421
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:51,927
For many years,
our city has lived a lie.

1422
01:17:51,927 --> 01:17:54,799
But this time,
I would like for the people

1423
01:17:54,799 --> 01:17:57,759
of this town, together with the
Pokémon always by our sides...

1424
01:17:57,759 --> 01:18:01,545
...to join hands
in fighting this fire!

1425
01:18:01,545 --> 01:18:04,026
This place is unbelievable!

1426
01:18:04,026 --> 01:18:06,158
So how do
you intend to get it

1427
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:07,377
running without electricity?

1428
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,119
With this!

1429
01:18:13,644 --> 01:18:15,428
Would you look at that?

1430
01:18:16,473 --> 01:18:17,866
Good boy!

1431
01:18:19,432 --> 01:18:21,304
Is she serious?

1432
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:25,351
Now it's
time for brute strength!

1433
01:18:25,351 --> 01:18:27,353
We're gonna need
everybody on this!

1434
01:18:27,353 --> 01:18:30,661
Listen up! You have
to push that all at once!

1435
01:18:30,661 --> 01:18:33,620
Wait, Granny!
This runs on muscle power?!

1436
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:36,275
You have
some other power handy?

1437
01:18:36,275 --> 01:18:37,668
You're kidding...

1438
01:18:37,668 --> 01:18:40,453
Hey! Don't
just stand there! Positions!

1439
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:44,675
And we're off!

1440
01:18:45,676 --> 01:18:46,764
All together now...

1441
01:18:47,809 --> 01:18:49,419
And...go!

1442
01:18:50,986 --> 01:18:52,596
And...push!

1443
01:18:54,467 --> 01:18:55,425
Okay...

1444
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:30,329
YEAH!

1445
01:19:33,463 --> 01:19:35,204
Pikachu, are you okay?

1446
01:19:40,252 --> 01:19:42,951
Zeraora!
Please stop this, please?

1447
01:19:42,951 --> 01:19:45,257
Deep down,
you know it's true...

1448
01:19:45,257 --> 01:19:47,172
You know there are
people who aren't so bad!

1449
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:50,001
Please trust us!

1450
01:19:57,748 --> 01:19:59,184
Zeraora!!

1451
01:20:06,104 --> 01:20:07,323
Oh, no!

1452
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:38,658
Pikachu...

1453
01:20:38,658 --> 01:20:41,487
All right!
Glad everyone's safe!

1454
01:20:41,487 --> 01:20:44,142
Hey Ash! You scared us!

1455
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:47,450
Zeraora...

1456
01:20:53,456 --> 01:20:55,371
Good.

1457
01:20:55,371 --> 01:20:57,590
Now we're friends, right?

1458
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,723
Sorry to
keep you waiting!

1459
01:21:01,856 --> 01:21:02,944
I finished it. See?

1460
01:21:02,944 --> 01:21:04,597
Callahan?

1461
01:21:04,597 --> 01:21:08,253
Oh, Professor, look
at this! I got this lump moving!

1462
01:21:08,253 --> 01:21:09,864
That can't be the truth!

1463
01:21:09,864 --> 01:21:11,474
Let's call
it a half-truth!

1464
01:21:11,474 --> 01:21:14,694
This is incredible!
I can see this working.

1465
01:21:14,694 --> 01:21:16,131
It'll work!

1466
01:21:16,131 --> 01:21:18,350
Now, to spread
this onto the propellers...

1467
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:20,483
Leave it to me.

1468
01:21:20,483 --> 01:21:21,788
I can throw it.

1469
01:21:21,788 --> 01:21:23,399
Now wait just a minute!

1470
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:26,010
You're, you're going to
throw this into that?!

1471
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,403
What about a ladder?

1472
01:21:27,403 --> 01:21:29,013
The ladders
all got burned up!

1473
01:21:29,013 --> 01:21:30,580
Great...

1474
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:33,713
Professor.
Come on. This is the only way.

1475
01:21:33,713 --> 01:21:36,020
What's going on?!

1476
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,370
Okay, gang!
Get this moving again!

1477
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:40,459
This time
we'll turn the propeller!

1478
01:21:40,459 --> 01:21:42,505
Callahan...
my colleagues put all their

1479
01:21:42,505 --> 01:21:45,421
efforts into making this,
and it's all that exists!

1480
01:21:45,421 --> 01:21:47,292
Okay, I get it.

1481
01:21:47,292 --> 01:21:49,381
I'll make sure
it gets there for the sake

1482
01:21:49,381 --> 01:21:50,513
of my little Kellie!

1483
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:57,476
Right!
Push with all your might!

1484
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:10,620
This looks pretty bad.

1485
01:22:12,535 --> 01:22:15,146
All this debris will
break the ball before it even

1486
01:22:15,146 --> 01:22:16,321
gets to the propeller.

1487
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:20,412
Do you know
a different way?

1488
01:22:28,072 --> 01:22:29,987
I trust you...

1489
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:31,293
...partner!

1490
01:22:39,562 --> 01:22:41,651
Now,
give it everything you got!

1491
01:22:43,783 --> 01:22:46,830
Now turn, baby, turn!!

1492
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:01,932
Look at that...

1493
01:23:03,064 --> 01:23:04,630
It worked!

1494
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:10,375
The city's people
and Pokémon need to know

1495
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:11,463
of this right away!

1496
01:23:11,463 --> 01:23:12,595
Yes sir.

1497
01:23:14,162 --> 01:23:16,555
This is some blast!

1498
01:23:16,555 --> 01:23:17,556
Toren did it!

1499
01:23:24,607 --> 01:23:26,261
Hey! Look outside!

1500
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:31,875
What do you know?
They all did it!

1501
01:23:34,095 --> 01:23:35,531
Professor,
did you see that?

1502
01:23:35,531 --> 01:23:37,794
Of course I did!
It was incredible! One shot!

1503
01:23:37,794 --> 01:23:39,404
You're a genius!

1504
01:23:41,537 --> 01:23:42,407
It was all
because of Sudowoodo

1505
01:23:43,756 --> 01:23:45,802
Too early
for celebrating just yet...

1506
01:23:45,802 --> 01:23:47,412
This mess isn't over!

1507
01:24:00,599 --> 01:24:02,123
The fire isn't going out!

1508
01:24:02,819 --> 01:24:04,342
It's okay!

1509
01:24:04,342 --> 01:24:06,605
We'll just keep it contained
until Risa can call Lugia!

1510
01:24:12,002 --> 01:24:13,308
Isn't that...

1511
01:24:16,398 --> 01:24:18,226
Take half
and go around the back!

1512
01:24:18,226 --> 01:24:19,227
It's Father!

1513
01:24:20,358 --> 01:24:21,577
Margo!

1514
01:24:23,144 --> 01:24:24,623
It's Zeraora!

1515
01:24:24,623 --> 01:24:25,755
I'd never seen it...

1516
01:24:27,974 --> 01:24:29,759
It's okay, Zeraora!

1517
01:24:29,759 --> 01:24:32,588
This time, everyone's
here to protect the forest.

1518
01:24:32,588 --> 01:24:34,111
Don't worry!

1519
01:24:41,075 --> 01:24:42,380
All right! Get going!

1520
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:45,166
Ash...

1521
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:47,429
You're all right!

1522
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:49,170
This situation's not good.

1523
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:50,954
The sprinkler system!

1524
01:24:50,954 --> 01:24:53,478
If it's not broken,
we can get it to work!

1525
01:24:53,478 --> 01:24:55,089
I'll ask the
Electric-type Pokémon

1526
01:24:55,089 --> 01:24:57,047
for assistance!

1527
01:24:57,047 --> 01:24:58,657
Let's
put this fire out!

1528
01:24:58,657 --> 01:25:00,137
Right! We can help, too!

1529
01:25:02,574 --> 01:25:04,924
Zeraora? Listen to me.

1530
01:25:04,924 --> 01:25:08,624
There are bad people...like
those hunters out there...

1531
01:25:08,624 --> 01:25:12,584
...and I admit we all
make bad mistakes sometimes.

1532
01:25:12,584 --> 01:25:15,196
But I want you to
realize that we're not all

1533
01:25:15,196 --> 01:25:17,546
like those bad people.

1534
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:18,895
Ash said something...

1535
01:25:18,895 --> 01:25:21,419
People can be
pretty weak by themselves.

1536
01:25:21,419 --> 01:25:25,119
But when they team up
with Pokémon, it creates energy!

1537
01:25:27,121 --> 01:25:28,818
I was wondering...

1538
01:25:28,818 --> 01:25:30,863
If it's also true...

1539
01:25:30,863 --> 01:25:33,301
If Pokémon felt
the same way about us...

1540
01:25:33,301 --> 01:25:35,868
Well...I think
that it'd be nice.

1541
01:25:44,138 --> 01:25:46,052
Try it now!

1542
01:25:46,052 --> 01:25:47,445
We're counting on you!

1543
01:26:09,728 --> 01:26:11,382
Okay, work with me!

1544
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:20,261
All right!

1545
01:26:25,614 --> 01:26:27,181
Hey, Ash!

1546
01:27:05,871 --> 01:27:07,090
Give it your all!

1547
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:08,134
You can do it!

1548
01:27:08,134 --> 01:27:09,223
You can do it!

1549
01:27:09,223 --> 01:27:10,441
Zeraora!

1550
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:12,922
Please, Zeraora...

1551
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:21,452
If Pokémon felt
the same way about us...well...

1552
01:27:21,452 --> 01:27:23,585
I think that it'd be nice.

1553
01:27:32,855 --> 01:27:34,378
Just a little more...

1554
01:27:40,123 --> 01:27:41,429
It's almost there!

1555
01:27:41,429 --> 01:27:42,517
Go on!

1556
01:27:42,517 --> 01:27:43,518
Just a little more!

1557
01:27:43,518 --> 01:27:44,519
You can do it!

1558
01:27:44,519 --> 01:27:45,520
I know you can!

1559
01:27:46,608 --> 01:27:47,783
Zeraora!!

1560
01:28:20,163 --> 01:28:21,251
Zeraora!

1561
01:28:21,251 --> 01:28:22,470
No!!

1562
01:28:28,563 --> 01:28:29,477
Zeraora!

1563
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:33,568
Zeraora, wake up, please!

1564
01:28:35,526 --> 01:28:36,527
Thank goodness!

1565
01:28:46,624 --> 01:28:47,625
Lugia?

1566
01:28:50,715 --> 01:28:52,674
Lugia, could
you make the rain fall?

1567
01:28:52,674 --> 01:28:54,589
We need to put the fire out!

1568
01:28:54,589 --> 01:28:55,633
Please, will you?

1569
01:29:15,349 --> 01:29:17,351
Lugia.

1570
01:29:17,351 --> 01:29:19,744
Whaddaya know?
I saw the real thing!

1571
01:29:19,744 --> 01:29:22,225
Risa got to the
eternal flame just in time!

1572
01:29:22,225 --> 01:29:23,444
Eternal flame?

1573
01:29:23,444 --> 01:29:25,271
She made
it there so quickly!

1574
01:29:25,271 --> 01:29:28,579
Yeah! She said that
she'd make sure Lugia showed up!

1575
01:29:28,579 --> 01:29:31,321
You've gotta admire
that girl's sheer moxie!

1576
01:29:31,321 --> 01:29:36,065
Once again our city
was saved by Zeraora and Lugia.

1577
01:29:36,065 --> 01:29:37,675
Not quite...

1578
01:29:37,675 --> 01:29:40,112
This time,
everyone saved it!

1579
01:30:17,976 --> 01:30:21,937
Fellow citizens! The only
way we were able to reopen the

1580
01:30:21,937 --> 01:30:24,069
festival for its final day...

1581
01:30:24,069 --> 01:30:26,376
...is through the
complete cooperation of all of

1582
01:30:26,376 --> 01:30:29,205
you, people and Pokémon alike.

1583
01:30:29,205 --> 01:30:32,730
During the day's events,
I'd like to share what I heard.

1584
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:35,994
A young man said if
one can't do something alone,

1585
01:30:35,994 --> 01:30:38,257
one can with a Pokémon.

1586
01:30:38,257 --> 01:30:40,912
Those citizens and
Pokémon who helped put out the

1587
01:30:40,912 --> 01:30:44,742
fires, along with many others,
proved those words are true.

1588
01:30:44,742 --> 01:30:47,919
My wish is for this city
to be a place to live together!

1589
01:30:47,919 --> 01:30:50,835
And now, our city is that
much closer to that.

1590
01:30:50,835 --> 01:30:54,273
In order to see that
realized, I revoke the lie about

1591
01:30:54,273 --> 01:30:56,711
the disappearance of Zeraora.

1592
01:30:56,711 --> 01:31:00,236
I hereby proclaim that we
will live with Zeraora in peace!

1593
01:31:23,912 --> 01:31:26,871
There are strange
and wonderful forms of life

1594
01:31:26,871 --> 01:31:28,438
inhabiting this planet.

1595
01:31:28,438 --> 01:31:31,310
They can be found
in the skies, in the sea,

1596
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:33,878
in forests and towns everywhere.

1597
01:31:33,878 --> 01:31:36,098
Indeed,
these creatures can

1598
01:31:36,098 --> 01:31:37,621
be found the world over!

1599
01:31:37,621 --> 01:31:39,754
They work and play with us,

1600
01:31:39,754 --> 01:31:41,930
and we all help each other.

1601
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:45,977
They live with us and around
us, and even battle with us!

1602
01:31:45,977 --> 01:31:49,503
They form all kinds
of different bonds with us, as

1603
01:31:49,503 --> 01:31:52,636
they live in peace alongside us.

1604
01:31:52,636 --> 01:31:55,987
Each living
being has its own dream.

1605
01:31:55,987 --> 01:31:58,990
And there are as many
adventures to be experienced as

1606
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:00,601
there are living beings!

1607
01:32:00,601 --> 01:32:04,648
And the name of all
these incredible creatures?

1608
01:32:04,648 --> 01:32:10,654
We call them...Pokémon!

1609
01:36:47,513 --> 01:36:49,124
And so...

1610
01:36:49,124 --> 01:36:50,865
Fula City
created a nature preserve!

1611
01:36:54,346 --> 01:36:56,174
Risa?!

1612
01:36:56,174 --> 01:36:59,743
Tell me! How in the world
did you know where I was?

1613
01:36:59,743 --> 01:37:01,876
And it had
better be the truth...

1614
01:37:01,876 --> 01:37:04,792
It's really kind of
high-tech...

1615
01:37:04,792 --> 01:37:07,490
I wanted pictures
of the Wind Festival...

1616
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:08,665
So I uh...

1617
01:37:12,277 --> 01:37:13,278
Pikachu?

1618
01:37:14,171 --> 01:37:16,194
I wonder what kind of
Pokémon we'll meet next?

1619
01:37:17,305 --> 01:38:17,261
