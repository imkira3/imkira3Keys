1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,340
Balance metric pressure at 057.

3
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,638
Metric pressure sustaining 057.

4
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:47,969
Releasing valves.

5
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,685
Prepare to load M.R.D.

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,349
Radioactivity meters online,
ready for exposure.

7
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,728
Docking hatch open and clear.

8
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,064
M.R.D. removed from containment.

9
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,398
Preparing to load.

10
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,689
Hold full exposure duration
at no more than ten seconds.

11
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,366
Nine, eight...

12
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,573
seven, six...

13
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,950
five, four...

14
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,036
three, two...

15
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,579
one.

16
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,500
M.R.D. in place.

17
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,627
Close hatch.

18
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,463
Turn handle left 45 degrees.

19
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,179
Lock it at high noon to engage sequence.

20
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,150
Left 45, then right.

21
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,527
Left... right.

22
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,823
You just caused a thermonuclear explosion,
wiped out the whole city.

23
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,572
Sorry, Jim.

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,455
- I promise I'll get it right on the day.
- This is the day, Matty.

25
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,183
You want us to switch?

26
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,876
No, there's no time for him
to learn the meters.

27
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,833
I'll never understand
how you're able to solve

28
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,133
the most complex mathematical equations,
but you can't tell left from right.

29
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,588
It's a form of dyscalculia.

30
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,174
The parietal lobes
of my cerebral cortex...

31
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,589
Okay.

32
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,224
We have time for one more practice
run at this. Reset everything.

33
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,057
We've been at this for 72 hours straight.

34
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,392
Only two more till we go live.

35
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,231
I'll get you some more coffee.

36
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:05,151
Coffee, amphetamines, more coffee.
You're gonna kill yourself.

37
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,568
We are precious moments
from a topological anomaly.

38
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,778
Is that what I should tell
everyone at your funeral?

39
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,067
No.

40
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,032
You signed a confidentiality agreement.

41
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,246
Jim Beale, project log.

42
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,381
Part one of the experiment.

43
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,792
Tentative results.

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,128
Opening a traversable wormhole
in the space-time continuum,

45
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,138
first ever recorded.

46
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,304
This tear that I will create in the fabric
of the universe is powered by M.R.D.

47
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,725
Extremely volatile, radioactive substance,

48
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,893
so, of course,
all precautions will be taken.

49
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,657
Possible dangers range
from manageable radiation leak to...

50
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,569
well, the universe collapsing onto itself.

51
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,998
It's now 47 minutes until we initiate
the first part of the sequence...

52
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,208
opening one end of the wormhole.

53
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,587
Okay. He should be here.

54
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,464
I'm gonna give him the Big Bang speech.

55
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,876
Oh, Jim, give him the fireworks.
That's what he's here for.

56
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,965
Now, once opened, we should detect

57
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,927
a unique sequence
of particles sent through

58
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,512
from the other side, a sequence so unique

59
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,349
that we will know that we
sent them to ourselves.

60
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,732
And I will have proof of the findings to
show our venture capitalist, Klaus Meisner.

61
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,404
And he will then provide
the necessary M. R.D.

62
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,068
for us to open the other end.

63
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,411
Let's see what I'm paying for.

64
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,123
Then we will send this unique
sequence of particles

65
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,581
back through to ourselves, thereby
proving that the project is a success.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,048
The Big Bang. We have proven theories...

67
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,088
This isn't my ideal situation.

68
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,844
To have an investor be this kind
of major factor in an experiment.

69
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,929
But I only have enough M.R.D.
to open one end.

70
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,598
We are about to embark on a journey

71
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,564
- that's going to take...
- Enough of the physics lesson.

72
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,690
Get on with the light show.

73
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,239
This whole thing is
an experiment in certainty.

74
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,536
I'm certain it will work.

75
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,092
Balance metric pressure at 057.

76
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,800
Metric pressure sustaining 057.

77
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,055
Releasing valves.

78
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,309
Docking hatch open and clear.

79
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,471
Prepare to load M.R.D.

80
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,729
M.R.D. removed from containment.

81
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,649
Hold full exposure no longer
than ten seconds.

82
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,737
Nine, eight...

83
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,156
seven, six...

84
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,121
five, four...

85
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,832
three, two...

86
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,213
one.

87
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,208
M.R.D. in place.

88
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,131
Close hatch.

89
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,800
Turn handle left 45 degrees.

90
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,393
Lock it at high noon.

91
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,902
Engage sequence.

92
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,865
Here we go.

93
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,762
Jim. Jim.

94
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,146
We thought you were having a seizure.

95
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,771
- Did it work?
- Kept you from biting your tongue.

96
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,403
- No, the machine.
- The magnetic core melted.

97
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,110
- The regulator's blown.
- Where's Klaus?

98
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,899
He left when you were unconscious.

99
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,077
You can only burn a candle
at both ends for so long.

100
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,991
You should go home and get some sleep.

101
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,472
I sold my home to pay you and Matty.

102
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,830
Maybe it was sabotage.

103
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,871
- Right.
- No, I'm serious.

104
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,924
Maybe it was visitors from the future
who came back to destroy our project

105
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,586
because it eventually leads
to some distant apocalypse.

106
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,555
It's a distinct possibility.

107
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,425
Guys.

108
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,471
Look what I found.

109
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,540
It's an exotic hybrid of the dahlia genus.

110
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,995
There. Right there. That black speck.

111
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,792
Could be a missing pixel.

112
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,048
- It's moving.
- Yeah. There it goes.

113
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,547
There.

114
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,005
- I think that was Matty.
- No, no, I saw someone.

115
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,924
I saw it before I blacked out.

116
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,763
It looked like a person. Not Matty.

117
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,056
They went out the front.

118
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,633
Where did you just come from?

119
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,554
I should be asking you.
How did you do that?

120
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,964
- What?
- That.

121
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,465
How did you get here?

122
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,430
In a car. How did you get here?

123
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,310
You didn't just walk through a wormhole?

124
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,971
You're making me feel like I did.

125
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,605
I just met you.

126
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,434
Then why are you acting like you know me?

127
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,234
I don't.

128
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,795
You left before you could see.

129
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,043
It was a success.

130
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,883
Didn't appear that way to me, Mr. Beale.

131
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,384
If you just come back into the lab.

132
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,676
You've wasted my money.
Now you're wasting my time.

133
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,935
I can prove to you that it worked.

134
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,643
Look, I'm already late
for a previous engagement.

135
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,433
We made history tonight. I'm sure
whoever it is will understand.

136
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,101
"Whoever it is" is my wife.

137
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,360
She's already at the restaurant,

138
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,524
and I assure you, she will not understand.

139
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,700
Why don't you
and your little friend join us

140
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,581
and we can discuss this over dinner?

141
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,370
We just met.

142
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,706
- Another time, then.
- No. no, no, no.

143
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,421
We would love to join you and your
wife for dinner, wouldn't we?

144
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,082
- Abby.
- Abby.

145
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,791
Abby.

146
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,420
What's going on, Jim?

147
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,430
Start running preliminary tests
on the flower.

148
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,557
I'm gonna go to dinner
with the Meisners and Abby.

149
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,922
Okay.

150
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,770
Who's Abby?

151
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,390
What we've done is folded

152
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,769
on top of itself
by forming a tunnel, a shortcut

153
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,273
between one location in space-time
to another light-years away.

154
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,150
But in order to traverse a wormhole,
you have to have two openings.

155
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,358
What we did tonight
was open one end of it.

156
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,772
Where's the other end?

157
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,066
We have to do it again to find out.

158
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,576
I'm not sure I follow.

159
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,704
The way it works is, you need
a transmitter and a receiver.

160
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,116
Now, like a telephone...
I'm mixing metaphors here,

161
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,831
but you can't complete a call
without another phone involved.

162
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,787
We already have the receiver.

163
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,588
We got the call.

164
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,924
How much?

165
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,965
It's not capital I'm asking for.

166
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,674
No, for the whole project.

167
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,091
The research, the formulas,
the machine, everything. How much?

168
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,305
It's not for sale.

169
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,515
Then what do you want, Mr. Beale?

170
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,602
- Another unit of M.R.D.
- And for that I get what, 10%?

171
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,687
We're talking about
dangerous radioisotopes,

172
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:50,520
enriched uranium, yellowcake, the sort
of thing countries go to war over.

173
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,735
Not anymore, once we have the ability

174
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,991
to answer the fundamental
questions of the universe.

175
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,618
But how will we make money
on our investment?

176
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:04,084
With all due respect, we're not talking
about hover cars and x-ray goggles.

177
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,458
We're talking about an epoch
of human evolution.

178
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,998
Pardon my pedestrian viewpoint, Mr. Beale,

179
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,963
but how do you plan to market that?

180
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,930
Pardon my pedestrian viewpoint
for a moment, Ms. Meisner.

181
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,681
Do you know who pioneered electricity?

182
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,642
Of course.

183
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,428
Thomas Edison.

184
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,480
I thought so, too.

185
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,480
Until I stumbled upon a book
about Nikola Tesla.

186
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,489
You see, Tesla was working towards a way

187
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,901
to get everyone on the planet safe, free,

188
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,071
limitless electricity, and he would have,

189
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:45,704
except Edison did everything in his power
to discredit him and crush his reputation.

190
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,126
Mm.

191
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:52,298
Edison's company developed a patent for
an inefficient current you had to pay for.

192
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,964
Tesla wanted to better the world.

193
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,970
And Edison forced us all
to have a monthly power bill

194
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,427
because he was envious of a profound idea.

195
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:07,684
Now, I don't have a horse in this race,
but I would put my money on Jim,

196
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,727
because he's Tesla, and Edison was a dick.

197
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,787
I'll supply you with the M.R.D.

198
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,828
But I want to own half the machine.

199
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,165
Can't do that.

200
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:38,587
Well, you see, my company
is in the enviable position

201
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,131
of being the sole manufacturer of M.R.D.

202
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,268
So, best of luck.

203
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,105
Forty-nine percent.

204
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,600
And money for the repairs.

205
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,690
You have a week.

206
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,404
I won't sleep till it's complete.

207
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,537
Thank you.

208
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,002
Thank you.

209
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,184
You want to share a cab?

210
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,784
Was I playing the beard tonight?

211
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:55,668
Why do you ask?

212
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,380
Well, either you came to the lab with Klaus
or you got there through the wormhole.

213
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,720
I did arrive with Klaus.

214
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,720
But I'm leaving with you.

215
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,310
That kiss could've cost me
millions of dollars.

216
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,935
Would it have been worth it?

217
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,702
I'd have to do more research,
eliminate the variables.

218
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,986
Mm.

219
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,429
This is me.

220
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,852
You sure he won't mind?

221
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,262
He went home...

222
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,146
with his wife.

223
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,907
Drinks?

224
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,543
Black coffee for me.

225
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,382
KMC 0-14.

226
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,097
You like my dahlia?

227
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,772
Yeah. Where did you get it?

228
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,461
Sorry. I have to take this.

229
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,419
Chuck, what do you got?

230
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,050
What are you doing?

231
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,505
Uh, talking to you.

232
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,762
What time do you have
exactly to the second?

233
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,763
9:45:22, 23.

234
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,051
Come on, get on with it.

235
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,765
When did you and I first meet?

236
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,765
- What is this?
- Just tell me. It's important.

237
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,311
Uh, ten years ago at that karaoke bar
with the weird name. What's going on?

238
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,696
So, we've known each other along time.

239
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,482
- We trust each other?
- Yeah.

240
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,901
Stay away from that girl.
She's no good for you.

241
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,114
What?

242
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,532
Just don't tell her
or anyone else about the experiment.

243
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,914
We're onto something
much bigger than we imagined.

244
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,680
What are you doing here, Jim?

245
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,303
I went to the lab. You guys were gone.

246
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,805
You should go back. We'll meet you there.

247
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,565
No, no, no, you called. You said
something... We were onto something.

248
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,356
And what was this stuff about Abby?

249
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,322
My head is killing me.

250
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,654
See?

251
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,995
I told you, you need to stop popping
those pills and get some sleep.

252
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,335
What did you mean earlier
when you were talking about Abby?

253
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,046
Let me get you some pills.

254
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,092
Chuck. Chuck, I figured it out.
It makes sense.

255
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,673
I finally see it now.

256
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,596
Fucking intense.

257
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,477
Matty, stop. You're giving Jim a headache.

258
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,389
This isn't a headache. This is
a lightning storm between my temples.

259
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,980
Just tell me, what did you mean earlier
when you were talking about...

260
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,564
How long was I out?

261
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,321
Huh? Oh, Jim, you're awake.

262
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,367
Um, you were unconscious
for approximately 8.5 hours.

263
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,822
Why didn't you wake me?

264
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,080
Your biological imperative requires
a minimum amount of dormancy per day

265
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,865
in order to properly function.

266
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,834
But you should lie back down
in case of another...

267
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,495
I just needed some sleep. I got plenty.

268
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,539
Where'd you get that jacket?

269
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,128
Haven't you considered the correlation

270
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,716
between your episodes
and the arrival of KMC 0-14?

271
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,221
KMC 0...

272
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,222
The serial number of the dahlia.

273
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,183
We have to wait for Chuck to get back.

274
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,102
You and Chuck meet me at the lab.

275
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,271
We have another wormhole to open.

276
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,655
We have to wait for Chuck.

277
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,758
Hey, did you forget your keys?

278
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,882
Is this the residence of Abby Ross?

279
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,391
She's not here.

280
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,561
This is Jim Beale. I'm a friend of hers.

281
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,854
Hey, sleepyhead, looking for me?

282
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,267
Is there a man in your place?

283
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,324
I guess you buzzed
my neighbor by accident.

284
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,780
I need to see your flower.

285
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,992
Wow, classy. I am a lady.

286
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,833
You can at least buy me breakfast first.

287
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,301
Do they even serve breakfast here?

288
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,887
Two morning specials, Mike.

289
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,315
Your dahlia, where did you get it?

290
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,856
It was a gift.

291
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,615
Exotic plants like that are hard to
come by. It's an expensive present.

292
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,037
Ahh.

293
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,376
It was from someone who
gave me everything I wanted

294
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,131
except a minute of his time.

295
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,001
Well, time is our only real currency.

296
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,087
Hm.

297
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,389
Meeting you was the most
important part of my experiment.

298
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,020
Is that a fact?

299
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,730
Hm. No, it's not a fact.

300
00:23:55,893 --> 00:24:00,030
I, uh, only meant to say that your dahlia,
that may be important to my research.

301
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,566
Mm-hmm.

302
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,949
Hit me again, Mike.

303
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,704
Or maybe not, I don't know.
Right now it's just a theory.

304
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,130
So, what's all this fuss about my dahlia?

305
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,890
How do I know I can really trust you?

306
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,552
The truth will set you free.

307
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,778
The ID number matches the one
that came through the wormhole.

308
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,154
But that's probably just a coincidence.

309
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,577
You people don't believe in coincidences.

310
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,412
Sure we do. Yeah.

311
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,667
Einstein himself said that they're
God's way of remaining anonymous.

312
00:24:56,245 --> 00:25:00,216
So, your machine working
was total happenstance.

313
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,468
No. No, that was me. I did it.

314
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,338
I'm the one that came up
with the idea that made it work.

315
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,263
And what was that?

316
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,309
The rotation of the Earth.

317
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:15,271
The biggest obstacle in opening a wormhole
is creating enough energy.

318
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,108
Not unlike the tremendous amount of energy

319
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,111
that an entire planet makes
as it spins on its axis.

320
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,154
The power is there.

321
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,824
I didn't have to generate it.

322
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,281
I just thought of a way to utilize it.

323
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,951
Kind of like us.

324
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,500
I mean, the energy's there.

325
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,578
We just got to think of a way to use it.

326
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,526
Jim?

327
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,990
Are you okay?

328
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,245
Chuck.

329
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,240
You found me.

330
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,166
Technology's come a long way.

331
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,668
Not being found is hard.

332
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,046
I think we sent this to ourselves.

333
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,976
Chuck...

334
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,607
you were right about the girl.

335
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,313
...five, four...

336
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,358
three, two...

337
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,034
Jim. Jim, Jim.

338
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,621
The pressure dropped below 029.
We have to abort.

339
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,368
All right, abort.
It's that damn bracket again.

340
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,377
We're gonna have
to reconfigure the output.

341
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,504
It might take a while to recalibrate.

342
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,460
Why don't you take a break?

343
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,590
- I like your lighter.
- Take it, it's yours.

344
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,769
Needs fuel. Hand me those matches.

345
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,608
So, my flower's really the same one
that came through your wormhole?

346
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,649
I'd have to run some tests
to know for sure.

347
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,491
What's my finder's fee?

348
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,115
What?

349
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,785
Okay, fine.

350
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,788
I'll settle for one butterfly kiss.

351
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:42,979
It's a match, Jim.

352
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,391
Identical DNA match.

353
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,730
KMC 0-14, you're the first
organism to time-travel.

354
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,319
Yes, but in a parallel-universe scenario,

355
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,076
we have to consider
that the Klaus Meisner Corporation

356
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,283
- may not have...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

357
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,289
- What did you just say?
- Parallel universe?

358
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,995
- We have to...
- No, no.

359
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,161
Klaus Meisner Corporation.

360
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,707
KMC 0-14. Klaus Meisner Corporation 0-14.

361
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,751
They license exotic plants
and flowers for domestic use.

362
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:14,469
We have to take into account

363
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:18,469
the very distinct possibility that these
two plants when they traversed...

364
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:19,724
Jim Beale.

365
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,556
I have Klaus Meisner for you.

366
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,015
Yeah, put him through.

367
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,806
Mr. Beale, you have
the dahlia in your possession.

368
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,943
Yes. Did she tell you that?

369
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,903
I want you in my office
to go over the contracts.

370
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,359
What's going on here?

371
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,544
You're about to get fucked.

372
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,602
Logic.

373
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,568
Rationale. Dignity.

374
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:15,027
All seem to disappear
with the scent of that perfume.

375
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,364
Good reason, common sense,
they just go by the wayside

376
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,288
'cause of the way her hair breaks across
her forehead and frames her eyes.

377
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:29,036
The total reckless abandon that you have
absolutely no control over, Mr. Beale.

378
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,125
Have a seat.

379
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,507
I prefer to stand
when I'm getting it from behind.

380
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,129
You watch your tone.

381
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,586
If you're gonna come at me,
you better come hard and fast

382
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,097
and be willing to go all the way,
because I never lose.

383
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,307
Klaus, listen.

384
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,264
You call me Mr. Meisner.

385
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,930
My best friends and associates call
me Klaus, but you, sir, are neither.

386
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,894
You are an employee.

387
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,812
I don't work for you.

388
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,613
The hard cost of one unit of M.R.D.

389
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,695
is five million, give or take a little.

390
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:03,658
What for you is a small fortune
is for me negligible.

391
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,828
I've lost larger sums
in the cushions of my sofa.

392
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:12,629
But you need M.R.D.
for your machine to work.

393
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:16,213
Therefore you come to me,
hat in hand, begging.

394
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,258
Forty-nine percent of my project
hardly makes you my boss.

395
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,424
This is true, but you need tangible
proof that your prototype works,

396
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,560
evidence that you've actually
created a traversable wormhole.

397
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,971
And to do that, you need to be able

398
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:33,392
to send the original specimen,
which is registered as KMC 0-14,

399
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,026
back through to the other side.

400
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,483
Now...

401
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,985
It just so happens
that I own all copyrights,

402
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,030
commercial and private,
for all KMC products,

403
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,497
which means...

404
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,580
this is your lucky day.

405
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,003
I'm willing to sell to you those rights

406
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:58,087
for let's say, 50% of your operation.

407
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,970
Now, if you put that together
with the 49% I already own...

408
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,466
Let's crunch the numbers,
that leaves you with...

409
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,352
one percent for your efforts.

410
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,181
Now, if you want to finish this experiment

411
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,850
that leads to the invention
of time travel,

412
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,814
then you, Mr. Beale, work for me.

413
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,945
You are an employee.

414
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,525
So, you slipped up.

415
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,656
Had a moment of weakness.

416
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,615
I have to admit,
she's an incredible piece of ass.

417
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:34,078
But you and I both know you're not gonna
walk away from the find of the century

418
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,796
because of whose name's gonna
end up in the textbooks.

419
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,754
Like our little friend said, you're Tesla,

420
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,629
and I'm quite content being just
another Edison of the world.

421
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,326
Jim Beale.

422
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:18,088
Project log, final entry
before zero hour of the experiment.

423
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,552
A piercing sound has been cutting
through every synapse of my brain

424
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,633
ever since I opened
the first end of the wormhole.

425
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,547
It's finally ceased.

426
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,845
Hopefully for good.

427
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,187
Klaus Meisner has me on the ropes.

428
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,562
He knew that I needed
a correlative between side "a"

429
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,772
and side "b" to prove
that the machine works.

430
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,354
Otherwise, it's just a bunch
of blinking lights.

431
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:46,446
I mean, if I send the dahlia back
to myself, then he owns my machine.

432
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,860
Wait, what are you doing?

433
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,699
I'm taking it back to its rightful owner.

434
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,410
The one variable in this is Abby.

435
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,542
And I need her to be a constant.

436
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,167
So if the fate of my machine
is predetermined,

437
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,833
it has to be because of her
that the dahlia goes through.

438
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,761
She has to be the one to put it
through the wormhole.

439
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,843
If she brings it to the lab,
if she comes there with Klaus...

440
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,350
that is very fucking unfortunate,

441
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,607
but at least I will know.

442
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,705
Jim.

443
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:45,466
- I really wasn't expecting you.
- You don't have to invite me in.

444
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,712
Good. It's a bit of a mess
in there at the moment.

445
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,926
The gun is to my head.

446
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,593
But I'm sure as shit
not gonna pull the trigger myself.

447
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,720
This is yours.

448
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,727
You get to decide what happens.

449
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,528
In two days, I'm gonna start the machine,

450
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,233
and I'll open the wormhole.

451
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,904
But now it's up to you
what goes through it.

452
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,488
You have to make the choice.

453
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,844
Mr. Meisner, would you be
so kind as to wait here

454
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,596
while I escort Ms. Ross and her dahlia

455
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,098
to the lab floor?

456
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,400
So, this is the way it's gonna be?

457
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,813
It's the way it has to be.

458
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,147
The way it is.

459
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:36,411
It only seems that way now, but eventually
you will see it in a different light.

460
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,242
We had our time together.

461
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,462
Goodbye, Jim.

462
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,808
Put these on.

463
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,313
Wouldn't want you to miss a thing.

464
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,328
Five, four...

465
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,115
three, two...

466
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,911
one.

467
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,826
M.R.D. in place.

468
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,540
Close hatch.

469
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:30,628
Turn handle left 45 degrees.

470
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,055
Lock it at high noon.

471
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,512
Engage sequence.

472
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:58,117
Commence graviton resonance.

473
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:07,248
You may own the dahlia,
but you don't own me.

474
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,195
Do you have a light?

475
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,199
Matches?

476
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,704
Two sticks I can rub together?

477
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,035
Yeah.

478
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,589
Recognize that?

479
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,921
Should I?

480
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,380
It's yours.

481
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,758
It is now. Thanks.

482
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,639
What you and Klaus are doing
is wrong, and it has to stop.

483
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,724
- Excuse me?
- I know what you're up to,

484
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,309
and I'm not gonna let it happen again.

485
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,900
That's none of your business.

486
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,520
It'll be my business if you
and I get involved.

487
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,194
Does this technique usually work for you?

488
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,451
Or have you been cooped up
in the lab too long,

489
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,862
- you've forgotten how to flirt?
- Listen, I'm onto you.

490
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,998
I should have known that someone
as intelligent and as beautiful

491
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,330
as you are, I should have known
there had to be some kind of catch.

492
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:58,085
There is a catch. It's a big one.

493
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,309
Where did you just come from?

494
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,062
I should be asking you.
How did you do that?

495
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,981
- What?
- That.

496
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,946
How did you get here? You didn't
just walk through a wormhole?

497
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,111
You're making me feel like I did.

498
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,617
I just met you.

499
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,853
Then why are you acting like you know me?

500
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,002
I don't.

501
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,453
- Tell me, Matty, again where it was.
- It was exactly right here.

502
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,238
You and I both almost stepped on it.

503
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:15,375
I didn't. I didn't see it when
I came in. I would've seen it, Matty.

504
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,503
When I was on the stairs, I came
here, and I almost tripped on it.

505
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,131
Jim? I thought you were
at dinner with Klaus.

506
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,133
I am.

507
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,886
Let's try this.

508
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,764
That's my phone.

509
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,140
Now, call it with yours.

510
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,645
It went to voice-mail.

511
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,414
Right. Try it again.

512
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,862
It's ringing.

513
00:42:55,013 --> 00:42:56,641
Chuck, what do you got?

514
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,790
- What are you doing?
- Uh, talking to you.

515
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,876
What time do you have
exactly to the second?

516
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,091
What? 9:45:22, 23.
Come on, get on with it.

517
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,378
It could be an imposter.

518
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,547
Ask him something only you and I know.

519
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,892
Uh, when did you and I first meet?

520
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,303
What is this?

521
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,016
Just tell me. It's important.

522
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:21,811
Uh, ten years ago at that karaoke bar
with the weird name. What's going on?

523
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,102
Ten years ago at the karaoke
bar with the weird name?

524
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,315
I didn't know that.

525
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,071
Chuck, you there?

526
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,779
Now, tell me not to trust Abby Ross.
She's just using me.

527
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,202
What? No.

528
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,989
You're my best friend. I will understand.

529
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,294
So, we've been friends a long time.

530
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,881
- We trust each other?
- Yeah.

531
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,256
Stay away from that girl.
She's no good for you.

532
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,128
What?

533
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:55,096
Just don't tell her or anyone
else about the experiment.

534
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,849
We're onto something much bigger
than we imagined.

535
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,434
- So, that happened.
- What is it?

536
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,692
Matty, you ever been
to a Native American orgy?

537
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,323
- No.
- It's fucking intense.

538
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,116
I don't get it.

539
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,324
If I'm doing my math correctly,
then there is a good chance

540
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,033
that I'm on my way here right now.

541
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,699
- How do you know?
- 'Cause it's what I did before.

542
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,004
I'm telling you,
this is where I'm coming next.

543
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,593
We don't know that for sure.

544
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,966
We need to keep you
isolated from the world

545
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,761
as much as possible to avoid
any collisions of causality.

546
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,646
But my being here hasn't
effected any real change yet.

547
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,148
That we know about.

548
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,856
We have to make sure that the machine
doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

549
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,237
Uncover the conspiracy
before it's too late.

550
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,238
What are you now, a secret agent?

551
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,651
You're a scientist,
and as a man of science,

552
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,037
you need to step back, breathe,

553
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:01,575
and take a moment
to properly analyze the data.

554
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,035
Fine.

555
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,789
Let me stay here and observe this
strange new habitat I've encountered.

556
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,007
Oh.

557
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,668
What is this?

558
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:14,937
It's a remote control.

559
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,757
In our time, we use it
to operate the television.

560
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,392
Oh, wow.

561
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,099
In the future, we control
the TV with our minds.

562
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,223
Oh, right.

563
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,062
You're only five days ahead of us.

564
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,602
This isn't a game.

565
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:32,655
You're now part of the experiment, Jim,
the same as the dahlia.

566
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,692
That means we have
to study you the same way,

567
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,531
follow the process.

568
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:42,285
I need you to go step by step
and tell us exactly how you did it.

569
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,745
What did it feel like?

570
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,306
The wormhole opened. I jumped in.

571
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,998
I don't know why you're being so obtuse.

572
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,919
Because we're wasting time
sitting around here yapping about it.

573
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,679
We must take action. I got duped.

574
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,464
We have to strike back.

575
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:02,010
We can't do anything until we
fully understand what happened.

576
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,430
We are messing with the primal
forces of nature here.

577
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,505
The primal forces of nature
are telling me I have to take a piss.

578
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,746
What are you doing here, Jim?

579
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,123
I went to the lab. You guys were gone.

580
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,829
You should go back. We'll meet you there.

581
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,666
No, no, no, you called. You said
something... We were onto something.

582
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,156
And what was this stuff about Abby?
And you were...

583
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,555
My head is killing me.

584
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:43,717
See? I told you, you need to stop
popping those pills and get some sleep.

585
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,687
What did you mean earlier
when you were talking about Abby?

586
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,351
Let me get you some pills.

587
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,358
Stay in here. Don't come out,

588
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,365
no matter what you hear.
Give me the aspirin.

589
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,869
Chuck, I get it now. It makes sense.

590
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,726
I finally see it now. Fucking intense.

591
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:08,709
Matty, stop. You're giving Jim a headache.

592
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:09,915
No, this isn't a headache.

593
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:13,051
This, this is a lightning storm
between my temples.

594
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,383
What were you saying earlier?

595
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,464
When we were on the phone, you said
something about not trusting Abby

596
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,517
and then we were onto something bigger.

597
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,600
No, no, no.

598
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,011
- No, no, no, no.
- Matty.

599
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,646
- This is far too much to calculate.
- You have to keep it together.

600
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,391
- Matty, look at me.
- You can't... No, no.

601
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,060
Look at me. Sing the pi song.

602
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,571
- ♪ 3.14159 ♪
- Yeah, there you go. Sing it.

603
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,449
- ♪ 265358 ♪
- Yeah.

604
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,781
♪ 93238... ♪

605
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,072
Jim.

606
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,999
Shit.

607
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,258
Time travel made that guy a real asshole.

608
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,829
The drink offer is rescinded.

609
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,113
Okay.

610
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,910
But what about coffee? Does that count?

611
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,624
I never had a chance to finish my coffee.

612
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,626
What do you want, Jim?

613
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,042
Look, I know I left
without saying goodbye,

614
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,210
but if you let me back up,
I just want a chance

615
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,254
to apologize for leaving
the way that I did.

616
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:44,857
So, let's hear it.

617
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,074
It better be good if you want
to see what's underneath.

618
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,490
I know what's underneath... trouble.

619
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,122
Do I really have to explain
how this works?

620
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,170
You grovel at my feet.

621
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,502
And then...

622
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,291
I came here with a plan.

623
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,803
There's so much that I want to say.

624
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,057
I don't know where to start.

625
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:24,067
There's certain tribes in the Amazon
where women use shamanistic ritual

626
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,653
to control their men
by driving them to insanity.

627
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:29,868
Are you a shaman?

628
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,701
No, I'm just a girl.

629
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,786
I'm sorry.

630
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,504
I'll take it.

631
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,837
Is this the residence of Abby Ross?

632
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,208
She's not here.

633
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,969
This is Jim Beale. I'm a friend of hers.

634
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,677
Hey, sleepyhead, looking for me?

635
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,767
Is there a man in your place?

636
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,974
I guess you buzzed
my neighbor by accident.

637
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:42,642
- I need to see your flower.
- Wow, classy. I am a lady.

638
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,106
You can at least buy me breakfast first.

639
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,875
The biggest obstacle in opening
a wormhole is creating enough energy.

640
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,085
Not unlike the tremendous amount of energy

641
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,004
that an entire planet makes
as it spins on its axis.

642
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:13,547
The power is there.

643
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,341
I just thought of a way to utilize it.

644
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:31,198
Double or nothing if I hit it again.

645
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:32,654
I'll take those odds.

646
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:39,073
The booze just hit me.
Not much of a drinker.

647
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,524
Give me that.

648
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:19,574
Ready?

649
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,959
Not being found is hard.

650
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,420
Especially when there's two of you.

651
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,382
That's not me,
'cause I'm sitting right here.

652
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,426
He might as well be some other guy.

653
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:48,812
But it's not. That is you a week younger.

654
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:51,269
But from now on,
she's only gonna be with me.

655
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,187
How can you know that?

656
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,608
Because that's what
I'm about to make sure of.

657
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,363
Whoa, Jim. Jim!

658
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,907
This isn't some relationship problem.

659
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,659
It's a little bigger than you
and that girl.

660
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,195
Not to me. Not anymore.

661
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,615
You can't go around changing the past
because you got your feelings hurt.

662
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,283
This is not the past for you.

663
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,622
I'm not changing anyone's past but my own.

664
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:15,210
No matter what happens to that guy,
I'm still gonna feel this way, right?

665
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,630
I have no idea. You're the first
person to ever do this.

666
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,635
Well, then the only way that
I know how to fix my past

667
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,296
is by taking control of my future.

668
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,965
What about the fact that she's
using you to get to the machine?

669
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,018
She's not. She's using him.

670
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:31,305
And that puts me in a fantastic
position to turn it all around.

671
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:53,793
Jim?

672
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,712
You okay?

673
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,256
Chuck. You found me.

674
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,965
Technology's come a long way.
Not being found is hard.

675
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,783
You taste like ash.

676
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,126
Who's that?

677
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,915
Just ignore it. They'll go away.

678
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,463
Will they?

679
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,519
They will.

680
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:57,899
It's Klaus.

681
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,484
Then definitely ignore it.

682
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,941
Doesn't he know I'm here?

683
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,862
I don't care if he knows or not.

684
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,366
Well, tell him. Tell him everything
is going according to plan.

685
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,455
- What are you talking about?
- Answer it.

686
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,412
I want to hear what you two
have to say to each other.

687
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,963
Fine.

688
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,389
I can't invite you in, Klaus.
Jim Beale is here,

689
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,721
and he's about to fuck
the shit out of me again.

690
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,075
Well, what are you waiting for?

691
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:55,408
I just cut off my only source of income
for you, so better make it worth it.

692
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,785
So you do work for him.

693
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,461
He was funding my research.

694
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,838
You're working
on a time-travel project for him.

695
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:05,501
- It's not for him.
- So why is he paying you for it?

696
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,967
You know, for a brilliant man,
you really are quite dim.

697
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:10,597
Please, enlighten me.

698
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:12,299
Don't make me say it.

699
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,468
Come on, the truth will
set you free, remember?

700
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,483
'Cause I was fucking him, all right?

701
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:27,565
Yeah, he paid my bills and my rent,
and whatever else I needed.

702
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:29,654
So then, why me?

703
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,745
It ended for me the night
you and I first met,

704
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:36,407
but it wasn't official until right now.

705
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,118
So you jump at the first guy
who comes along?

706
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:43,957
I mean, you must have had ulterior
motives to fuck me like you did.

707
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,959
You are being a childish asshole.

708
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,509
And you're right.

709
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,052
I was using you.

710
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,395
I was using you for my research.

711
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,354
A ploy to steal my ideas
for your nefarious scheme.

712
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:06,937
So, what is it?

713
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,814
Let's get all the cards on the table.

714
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,992
It's... it's not done yet.

715
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,778
Waiting for my next move, huh?

716
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,871
Well, you're making it.

717
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,158
You want to see what I'm working on?

718
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,422
I'll be down at the pub
drinking this day off.

719
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:38,685
Working in secret for two years in
a hidden lab on the outskirts of the city,

720
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:42,269
John Bane's prototype
had become the stuff of legend.

721
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,477
They say he invented a time machine.

722
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:51,657
But what no one knew was that only
moments before I met him,

723
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,408
it had actually worked.

724
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:54,989
Do you have a light?

725
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:58,659
I knew everything there was to know
about John Bane the physicist,

726
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:02,706
but I never imagined I would get
to know John Bane the man.

727
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:07,748
A science fiction novel.

728
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,051
More of a novella at this point.

729
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,596
Your hero, John Bane,
that's supposed to be me.

730
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,979
There was an article about you
that inspired the idea, yeah.

731
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,563
But once I met you...

732
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,520
Do you know who I am?

733
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,693
John, a physicist named John Bane.

734
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,699
The whole story got a lot more involved.

735
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,656
That's why it's not done yet.

736
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,203
I wanted to see how it played out.

737
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,871
Yeah, but it's not actually me.

738
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,418
It's just a version of me.

739
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,038
It doesn't have my memories or feelings.

740
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,419
That's unfortunate.

741
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:56,095
If we only had time.

742
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:58,924
Time to get closer.

743
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,059
I'm just a girl.

744
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,103
The girl of my dreams.

745
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,852
We could have a chance of something real.

746
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,397
I led myself to believe in serendipity.

747
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:17,735
But the cosmos had a cruel way
of making me believe otherwise.

748
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,996
As the day of the final
experiment grew near,

749
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,203
I wondered if we had a future together.

750
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,126
Or would fate keep us apart?

751
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,548
What happens from here on out is up to me.

752
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,754
That's why I'm here with you right now.

753
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,551
But you can't change fate.

754
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,091
It's like trying to make
the sun set with your mind.

755
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,644
Who's to say I can't?

756
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,115
See that?

757
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,409
That right there... I did that.

758
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,206
Tell me I didn't.

759
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:08,247
Scientists and their God complex.

760
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,547
I'm supposed to be the smoker here.

761
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,899
- Are you okay?
- Jim, are you okay?

762
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,762
- Jim?
- It's not Jim.

763
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,896
It's Abby. There's something
wrong with Jim.

764
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,774
He's coughing up blood, and he's...

765
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,934
he's been having seizures,
and I don't know what to do.

766
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,728
Can you please... can you please come?

767
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,648
He won't let me take him
to the hospital. I'm just...

768
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,816
- Abby, Abby.
- Yeah?

769
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:25,613
Don't do anything until I get there.
Don't call anyone.

770
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:27,663
Don't do anything.

771
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,495
- I'm coming.
- Okay.

772
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:48,806
Wait, what are you doing?

773
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:52,765
Uh... Tell Jim Prime
I'm taking this to a specialist

774
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,604
for more intensive examination.

775
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,450
Where's the other one?

776
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,745
Chuck took it to an examinist
for further specialization.

777
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,075
Must be who called.

778
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,449
Wait, what are you doing?

779
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,242
I'm taking it back to its rightful owner.

780
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,426
Wormhole.

781
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,253
Such a weird word when you think about it.

782
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:27,591
Right now he's experiencing

783
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,852
what can only be described
as a kind of temporal feedback.

784
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,230
It seems that two beings
of the same consciousness

785
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,274
cannot exist in the same universe.

786
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,023
This must be nature's way
of correcting the anomaly.

787
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:46,117
That's your diagnosis? Temporal feedback?

788
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,786
That makes the most sense
given what we know.

789
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:54,538
Okay, Dr. Chuck, if you're
such an expert on space cancer,

790
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,499
then what should we expect from here?

791
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:00,749
If the rate of deterioration
stays in sync with 0-14,

792
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,338
terminus... that's what we call...

793
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,753
I get it. What?

794
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,340
He has about 48 hours, give or take.

795
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:14,471
Then his vital organs will disintegrate
until his biological functions shut down.

796
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,940
He's been chosen for extinction.

797
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:21,207
You have one hell of a bedside manner.

798
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:23,947
I'm a physicist, not an M.D.

799
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,246
How am I supposed to believe any of this?

800
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:47,841
Now's your chance.

801
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,426
This is your proof right here.

802
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,432
But please handle with care.

803
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,593
The fate of the universe is in your hands.

804
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,693
Jim.

805
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,945
I really wasn't expecting you.

806
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:13,455
You might want to hide in
the other room in case he comes in.

807
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:15,411
He won't. He thinks Klaus is in here.

808
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,621
No need to tell me who's in there.

809
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,287
- I have my theory.
- And what is that?

810
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,840
I'm not giving any more theories to you.

811
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:27,510
It's not why I came here.
It's not what I want from this.

812
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,346
And what do you want from this?

813
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:34,385
To ignore the facts,
give you the benefit of the doubt.

814
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,929
All of the observable evidence

815
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:41,733
leads to the inevitable conclusion
that you are playing me.

816
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,857
But I refuse to accept it.

817
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,023
I barely know you.

818
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:53,620
But something happened in those
brief hours we spent together.

819
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,702
It was how you looked at me.

820
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,326
Like how you're looking at me now.

821
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,662
Is the pain worse when he's close by?

822
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:03,830
Yeah.

823
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,506
Proximity to him must be a factor.

824
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:13,219
The best course of action
is to get you out of town

825
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:15,725
as far as possible to alleviate
the effects of the feedback.

826
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,476
You mean prolong the inevitable.

827
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:20,514
So, here it is. My act of faith.

828
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:22,975
The gun is to my head.

829
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,777
I'm sure as shit not gonna
pull the trigger myself.

830
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,693
This is yours.

831
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:32,450
You get to decide what happens.

832
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:37,364
In two days, I'm gonna start the machine,
and I'm gonna open the wormhole.

833
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,543
But it's now up to you
what goes through it.

834
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:05,521
Chuck, I want you to take your friend
and get the fuck out of here.

835
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,481
- Okay.
- Abby.

836
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,191
You lied to me.

837
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,731
Not about me and you.

838
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:13,400
Me and you is all
totally based on bullshit.

839
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:14,909
If you could just see my logic on this.

840
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,069
Don't.

841
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,321
There's an explanation for all of it.

842
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,035
Not for how I feel.

843
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:22,951
I'm not even sure
who I'm talking to right now,

844
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:27,751
but whatever Jim you are, I want you
to get the hell out of my house

845
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:31,339
before I contract this psychotic disease.

846
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:35,050
I don't think that temporal
feedback is contagious.

847
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:36,214
No.

848
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,688
Matty? Where's Jim Prime?

849
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,655
I need you to slip away
and meet me at our place.

850
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,989
Tell him that you left
your reading glasses at home.

851
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,573
He knows you're useless without them.

852
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:03,082
Then break them and tell him you have
to go get your other pair.

853
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,368
Just do it, and...

854
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,455
...bring D-29B.

855
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:16,259
Dextro 29 boost. Still in beta.

856
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:21,635
It's a hybrid synthesis
of adrenal epinephrine secretions.

857
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:24,304
- Oh, yeah.
- It won't keep you alive.

858
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,849
But when you take it,
you won't know you're dying.

859
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:29,358
I'm dying. I'm dying, yes.

860
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:32,983
Yeah, okay. All right, what to do?

861
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,944
What to do? What to do? I'm dying.

862
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:37,484
Dying. Death, dead, 48 hours.

863
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,075
Forty eight hours. We have to prevent
that, don't we? We do. We should.

864
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,488
I say we don't do anything.

865
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,077
Don't open the other end of the wormhole.

866
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,250
- Then it's like it never happened.
- Have you considered...

867
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,958
I'm here. It happened. Yes... yes, it did.

868
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,872
- But have you considered...
- Yes, it did.

869
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:53,541
No, we roll up our sleeves.
We find a workable solution,

870
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,085
to explain the absence of paradoxes...

871
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,878
We have to get one of you out of here.

872
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,923
Let's come clean with Jim Prime.
He can go, and you can live.

873
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,966
He's not gonna do it
if he knows he will die.

874
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:03,722
Would you? No, you wouldn't.

875
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,933
I wouldn't. I've been... I mean, I did.

876
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,018
- I'm here, so...
- There is the notion...

877
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:09,478
Maybe it should be me that goes.

878
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,142
And make things worse?

879
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,606
- The theory...
- Are you joking?

880
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,612
Is he joking? Make things worse?

881
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,741
I have less than two days to live.
I lost the rights to my life's work.

882
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:20,527
My girlfriend, she hates me, so how
could it possibly get any worse?

883
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:21,945
Parallel dimensions.

884
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:24,701
Parallel dimensions.

885
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:27,704
There exists not one singular universe,

886
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,416
but an infinite number
of possibilities coinciding

887
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:32,706
simultaneously and eternally,

888
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:35,876
every conceivable version
of every being persisting forward

889
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,419
in a concurrent reality.

890
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:41,555
Your time-space excursion was not
to the past of your present universe.

891
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:45,218
On the contrary, it was simply
a migration from your plane of existence

892
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:46,727
to the one adjacent.

893
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:51,103
You're operating independently
of yourself in an alternate timeline.

894
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,939
- No.
- But...

895
01:11:58,105 --> 01:11:59,857
That's still hypothetical at this point.

896
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,492
And, of course, I already thought of that.

897
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:05,913
But being here, seeing it for myself,
everything played out exactly the same.

898
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:08,541
But your journal accounted for...

899
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:09,791
What journal?

900
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,079
Where did you get this?

901
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,918
It was in your coat pocket
when you traversed.

902
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,673
And you've had this the whole time?

903
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,301
I was processing it as a data set.

904
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:20,882
- It's not my handwriting.
- You were both so busy.

905
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,924
- This is her book.
- Whose book?

906
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,307
Abby's.

907
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,594
- It was alarmingly accurate.
- Matty?

908
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:31,435
This is a made-up story,
a work of fiction,

909
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,190
and an incomplete one at that.

910
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:35,776
Okay, enough theorizing.

911
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,608
All right? The machine
should be up and running.

912
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,192
How much more of this
go juice do you have?

913
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,447
Enough.

914
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,324
All right, I'm pulling
the trigger on our best option.

915
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:45,157
Klaus only paid for one unit of M.R.D.

916
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:46,616
We can't do this again.

917
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:50,325
If I go back through the wormhole knowing
what I know now to that first day...

918
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,793
we won't have to do this ever again.

919
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,386
I can take over from here.

920
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:07,801
Where have you been?

921
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,061
Uh, our mass spectrometer
was on the fritz.

922
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:14,228
I wanted to take 0-14 over to
the institute for final evaluation.

923
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,267
- How's it doing?
- Clean bill of health.

924
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,561
But they're gonna keep it tonight

925
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,981
so that they can run it through
the liquid scintillation counter.

926
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,149
Okay, as long as
they don't know what it's for.

927
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:24,533
They think it's a sample.

928
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,740
We're almost online.

929
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,246
You want to do a practice run?

930
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:29,822
Absolutely.

931
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,689
Oh, and, Chuck,
dahlia 2.0 is also gone for now,

932
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:05,320
so we have to send something else
through the wormhole.

933
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:08,570
I think I can find a replacement.

934
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:15,251
Balance metric pressure at 057.

935
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:18,496
Metric pressure sustaining 057.

936
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:20,315
Releasing valves.

937
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:27,847
Docking hatch open and clear.

938
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,220
Radioactivity meters online.

939
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:31,600
Ready for exposure.

940
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:36,059
Prepare to load M.R.D.

941
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,547
M.R.D. removed from containment.

942
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,182
Preparing to load.

943
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,304
Keep full exposure duration
no more than ten seconds.

944
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,438
Nine, eight...

945
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:19,769
seven...

946
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:22,435
Insertion of M.R.D. commencing.

947
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,856
...five, four...

948
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,400
three, two...

949
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:29,818
one.

950
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,778
M.R.D. in place.

951
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,036
Close hatch.

952
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:36,495
Jim. Jim, Jim.

953
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:39,581
The pressure dropped below 029.

954
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,041
We have to abort.

955
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:45,458
All right, abort.
It's that damn bracket again.

956
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,592
We're gonna have
to reconfigure the output.

957
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:48,969
I know how to fix it.

958
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,677
It might take a while to recalibrate.
Why don't you take a break?

959
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,720
I don't take breaks.

960
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,262
What about that stack
of readouts in your office?

961
01:15:58,429 --> 01:15:59,646
Have you gone through those yet?

962
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:04,398
Oh.

963
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,064
I see what you're doing.

964
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,116
You do?

965
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,198
You want me to sleep.

966
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,498
You're onto me.

967
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:19,701
Fine.

968
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,626
I'll leave you be to work
on that for a bit.

969
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,505
But I'm not napping.

970
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,356
Okay, Jim, get ready.

971
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:56,825
Matty, close the docking hatch.

972
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,575
Handle left 45 degrees.

973
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:01,742
Slide forward,

974
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:04,879
then lock at high noon
and engage sequence.

975
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:06,959
Chuck, I don't, uh...

976
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,208
Matty, let's go.

977
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,293
The left and right...

978
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,134
Matty, he could come back any second.

979
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,344
The left and right, they're not, um...

980
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:17,554
The left and right...

981
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,639
Matty, you've done it a thousand times.

982
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,353
Do it now.

983
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:38,009
You're still chasing after her, huh?

984
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:43,929
I never realize that's what
I'm doing... until I do it.

985
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:50,188
The power to cross
the universe in an instant.

986
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,358
The impossible dream becomes possible.

987
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:57,149
All the unbelievable things
you could accomplish,

988
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:59,318
the eternal questions you could answer.

989
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,363
And you just want to get laid.

990
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:06,041
- You'd do the same if it were you.
- You're probably right.

991
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:09,829
The machine still works.

992
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:11,915
But the M.R.D. is gone.

993
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,834
We could try to find the money.

994
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,549
Thirty six hours? I don't see how.

995
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,547
What about Klaus?

996
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,062
You have seen the future.

997
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:30,357
Could buy some stocks,
play the over-under on a game.

998
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,231
You didn't happen to catch
the news before you left?

999
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,355
It's over.

1000
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:37,406
I'm done with the past.

1001
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,113
If this is goodbye...

1002
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,367
least I could do is buy you dinner.

1003
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:52,705
Okay.

1004
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,726
We'll let Jim Prime
keep on without a clue,

1005
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,439
at least until you're gone.

1006
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,904
Yeah. Where's Matty?

1007
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:24,327
He was devastated by what he did.

1008
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:26,447
Didn't want to face you.

1009
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,251
This is you.

1010
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:37,382
I mean him.

1011
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,711
I should take this.

1012
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:42,592
Go ahead and order. I'll be right back.

1013
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:59,363
It's not done yet.

1014
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:11,959
Chuck told me everything.

1015
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,162
Chuck is an asshole.

1016
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,257
I want to hear it from you.

1017
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,219
Why did you really
go through the wormhole?

1018
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,556
Because my heart was broken.

1019
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,015
And you blame me?

1020
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:34,766
Abby, the only one to blame here is me.

1021
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:36,813
I did it to myself.

1022
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:47,307
I'm willing to let technology
take some of the fall here.

1023
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:57,497
So, I understand the only way to get
the other Jim into the wormhole

1024
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:01,463
is to show up tomorrow
with the dahlia and Klaus.

1025
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:04,136
That is one scenario, yeah.

1026
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,714
One that I would prefer not to repeat.

1027
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,723
But if it would save your life...

1028
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:12,770
It wouldn't, because we're about five
million shy of there even being a wormhole.

1029
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:14,897
I can get the money.

1030
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:19,893
No.

1031
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,688
Any questions about the menu?

1032
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,033
Can you please give us a minute?

1033
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,701
But it would be for us.

1034
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,374
Then we can have more time together.

1035
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:37,252
Look! I'm not gonna let you do that.

1036
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,755
It's my choice, not yours.

1037
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,879
Then it'll be your choice.

1038
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:57,022
Take me as far as you can.

1039
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,733
Checking in?

1040
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:50,783
Yes.

1041
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,115
Name, please.

1042
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:53,654
James Beale.

1043
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:07,589
Seems you are already staying
with us, Mr. Beale.

1044
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:10,754
What?

1045
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:17,807
Right.

1046
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:19,892
I forgot my key card.

1047
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,808
May I get a replacement, please?

1048
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:27,275
Of course.

1049
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,823
There exists not one singular universe,

1050
01:26:34,981 --> 01:26:37,325
but an infinite number
of possibilities coinciding

1051
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:39,737
simultaneously and eternally.

1052
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:52,170
Every conceivable version
of every being persisting forward

1053
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:55,381
in a concurrent reality.
Your time-space excursion

1054
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:57,967
was not to the past
of your present universe.

1055
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,973
On the contrary, it was simply

1056
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:03,264
a migration from your plane of existence
to the one adjacent.

1057
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:11,526
John Bane's time-space excursion
was not to his own past.

1058
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:15,940
Little did he realize he had traveled
to the past of a parallel universe...

1059
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:19,405
A timeline so similar to his own,

1060
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,788
he had simply overlooked the differences.

1061
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,039
An infinite number of possibilities,

1062
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:32,748
an infinite number of choices,
an infinite number of outcomes.

1063
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:38,045
Take me to The Grand Hotel.

1064
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:15,786
Mr. Meisner, would you be so kind

1065
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:19,377
as to wait here while I escort
Ms. Ross and her dahlia

1066
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:20,791
to the lab floor?

1067
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:32,056
Is this really what you want?

1068
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,101
Isn't there usually champagne
at these things?

1069
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,106
I could kill a whole bottle right now.

1070
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,484
Oh, so, this is the way it's gonna be.

1071
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:42,479
It's the way it has to be.

1072
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:43,989
The way it is.

1073
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:47,321
It only seems that way now,

1074
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:50,158
but eventually you'll see it
in a different light.

1075
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,947
So that's it, then? It meant nothing.

1076
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,835
Put these on.
I don't want you to miss a thing.

1077
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:51,306
Turn handle left 45 degrees.

1078
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:53,850
Slide forward.

1079
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,762
Lock it at high noon.

1080
01:31:58,054 --> 01:31:59,306
Engage sequence.

1081
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:30,256
I'm not interested, so don't even try.

1082
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:36,050
It may not look like it,
but I'm actually working.

1083
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:37,634
Do you know who I am?

1084
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:38,969
Should I?

1085
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:44,388
Oh, my God.

1086
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:46,935
You look just like him.

1087
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:49,188
Who?

1088
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:52,145
John.

1089
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:55,523
A physicist named John Bane.

1090
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:59,661
What a coincidence. I'm a physicist.

1091
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:03,114
They say he invented a time machine.

1092
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:04,908
Did he?

1093
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:08,252
No one knows.

1094
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:13,000
Anyways, he died in a lab explosion
before I got to interview him.

1095
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:14,258
Really?

1096
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:16,218
That's too bad.

1097
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:18,345
The fire destroyed all of his work.

1098
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:21,766
It's sad, really.

1099
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:24,932
To be so close to controlling time,

1100
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:28,689
and then poof... gone in an instant.

1101
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:35,355
Time is a great teacher
that eventually kills all of its students.

1102
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,994
I like that one. That's a good one.

1103
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,286
You have any more?

1104
01:35:48,618 --> 01:35:50,962
Yeah. Have a drink with me.

1105
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:54,499
I'll tell you all about
my time-travel experiment.

1106
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,756
Mine would make for a much better story.

1107
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:00,801
Your story is better?

1108
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:02,806
Is that a fact?

1109
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:06,181
No, just a theory.

1110
01:36:07,305 --> 01:37:07,633
