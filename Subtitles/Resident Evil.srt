1
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:58,095
<i>All Umbrella staff must wear their identity tags at all times.</i>

2
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:03,809
<i>All radiation badges will be collected
at 5:00 p. m. this afternoon.</i>

3
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,812
Thank you! God!

4
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,901
- Some people.
- Yeah.

5
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,474
- May be I won't show this time.
- Why not?

6
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,309
Because I'm busy.

7
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,568
It's nothing. Fire drill.

8
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,331
- What is that?
- Fire drill.

9
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,254
- Shit!
- Hey, what the hell is going on?

10
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,215
- Get the computers covered! Move it!
- Damn it, I'm trying!

11
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,425
The experiments! Move them!

12
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:31,188
Shouldn't the doors open or something?

13
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:34,358
It's supposed to take us to the nearest floor.

14
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,533
Hello? Hello?

15
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,410
What's happening?

16
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,539
<i>Line's dead.</i>

17
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,086
- What's the problem?
- The doors won't open.

18
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,047
- What about the ones at the back?
- Locked as well.

19
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,009
There's no fire here! No fire!

20
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,471
- The code doesn't work!
- No fire!

21
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,849
<i>- What's wrong with you?
- The door won't open!</i>

22
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,225
And this water isn't going anywhere.

23
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,477
- What?
- It's a sealed room.

24
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,522
- Help me with the door!
- Oh, fuck the doors!

25
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:26,493
We have to get out of here.
What's going on?

26
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,621
Has this happened before?
We have to get out of here.

27
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,540
- We have to get out of here!
- Take it easy.

28
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,751
- You take it easy!
- Quiet!

29
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,757
What is that?

30
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,190
Oh, my God.

31
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,597
Halon!

32
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,937
Stop it!

33
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,856
Stop it! Stop!

34
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,403
<i>Help!</i>

35
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,894
Let me see.

36
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,778
We're gonna have to get out of here.
We have to get out of this building!

37
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,697
Here, give me a hand.

38
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,535
That's as far as they'll go.
They're caught on something.

39
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,706
That's wide enough.
I can squeeze through. I'll get help.

40
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,007
I'm stuck. You're gonna have to push.

41
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,968
That's it.

42
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,344
A bit more.

43
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,389
What was that?

44
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,978
Oh, Christ! It's the brakes! Get out!

45
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,022
- I can't move!
- We have to get out of here!

46
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,032
Push her out of the way!

47
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,950
Pull me back inside!

48
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,244
Pull me back inside!

49
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,289
Hello?

50
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,011
Hello?

51
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,285
- Who are you?
- Move!

52
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,329
Don't touch me! Stop!

53
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,122
- Get away from me!
- Down!

54
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,220
What are you doing? I'm a cop!

55
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,223
I told you, I'm a cop!

56
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,397
You're breaking my arm!

57
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,240
Report

58
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,703
Report now.

59
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,038
What?

60
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,458
I want your report, soldier.

61
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

62
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,964
Sir, the house's primary defenses
have been activated.

63
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:02,217
She's probably still suffering
the side effects.

64
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,593
What are you doing with us?

65
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,803
What about the cop?

66
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,681
Matthew Addison. I'm not getting a match.

67
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,016
Who are you?

68
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,353
I just transferred. They probably
don't even have me on file yet.

69
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,939
The locals are inefficient. It's possible.

70
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,108
Should I secure him here?

71
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,114
No. We take him with us.

72
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,576
You can't do this!

73
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,122
Blow me.

74
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,626
Prep for entry to the Hive.

75
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,570
Power's down.

76
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,697
- So fix it.
- I'm on it.

77
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,755
Are you done yet?

78
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,757
Jump)'

79
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,521
Stand clear!

80
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,262
- You got a problem?
- How's that door?

81
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,389
- It's sealed shut.
- Let me.

82
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,615
Jumpy?

83
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,775
Lie still. Lie still!

84
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,530
Watch this light. follow it.

85
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,702
- Now, how many fingers am I holding up?
- Three.

86
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:40,787
Good.

87
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,705
Now tell me your name.

88
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,129
I don't know.

89
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:53,007
He's fine.
Memory loss, just like the other one.

90
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,300
Let's open that door.

91
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,323
Listen to me.

92
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:02,952
I want to know who you people are
and I want to know what's going on here.

93
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,455
Now!

94
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,626
You and I have the same employer.

95
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,878
We all work for the Umbrella Corporation.

96
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,256
The mansion above us
is an emergency entrance to the Hive.

97
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,427
You are security operatives
placed there to protect that entrance.

98
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,346
What about this?

99
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,224
Your marriage is a fake.

100
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:27,644
Just part of your cover
to protect the secrecy of the Hive.

101
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,520
And what is the Hive?

102
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,397
Show them.

103
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,401
Accessing schematic of the Hive.

104
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,654
Raccoon City, nearest urban center.

105
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,031
<i>The mansion where we found you</i>

106
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,742
<i>and through which we gained
access to the train</i>

107
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,828
<i>which, in turn, brought us to the Hive.</i>

108
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:53,002
<i>The Hive itself is located underground
deep beneath the streets of Raccoon City.</i>

109
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,673
<i>A top-secret research facility</i>

110
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,425
<i>owned and operated
by the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

111
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:04,180
<i>the Hive houses over 500 technicians,
scientists and support staff.</i>

112
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,475
<i>They live and work underground.</i>

113
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,270
<i>Their research is of the highest importance.</i>

114
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,814
<i>Its nature is classified.</i>

115
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,777
<i>Our position on the map
is indicated by heat signature.</i>

116
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,626
Why can't I remember anything?

117
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,463
The Hive has its own defense mechanisms,
all computer-controlled.

118
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,426
<i>A nerve gas was released into the house.</i>

119
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,180
Primary effect of the gas,

120
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:49,976
complete unconsciousness
lasting anything up to four hours.

121
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,563
Secondary effects are varied,
but can include acute memory loss.

122
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,565
- For how long?
- Subjective.

123
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,400
An hour, day, week.

124
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,236
So you're saying this place was attacked?

125
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,573
I'm afraid things are
a little more complicated than that.

126
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,118
Sir! We've breached the Hive.

127
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,254
J.D.

128
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:48,242
Got it.

129
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,632
Halon content has dissipated.

130
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:25,822
Makes it easier to work underground,
thinking there's a view.

131
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,845
Looks like we're taking the stairs.

132
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,233
- Status.
- Red Queen is locked onto us.

133
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,360
She knows that we're here.

134
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,113
Who's the Red Queen?

135
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,323
State-of-the-art artificial intelligence.

136
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,951
<i>She is the computer that controls the Hive.</i>

137
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,800
This is gonna slow us down.

138
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,221
Our route to the Queen
takes us straight through these labs.

139
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:35,224
Rain, J.D., see how bad the flooding is.

140
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,852
Kaplan, find us an alternate route.

141
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,399
What happened here?

142
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,655
Five hours ago, Red Queen went homicidal.

143
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,574
Sealed the Hive
and killed everyone down here.

144
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,076
- Jesus.
- When we realized what was happening,

145
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,287
my team was dispatched to shut her down.

146
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,749
- Why did she do it?
- That we don't know.

147
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,668
But outside interference is a possibility.

148
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,795
Jesus!

149
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,395
Hey. You okay?

150
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,902
- Here.
- No.

151
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,570
- I'm fine.
- Please, come on.

152
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,322
It's cold in here.

153
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,790
Are you...

154
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:49,131
Do you remember anything
from before this?

155
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:55,096
No. Nothing before the train.

156
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,849
And you?

157
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,479
No. Nothing.

158
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,942
I found an alternate route,
but it's gonna cost us time.

159
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:13,531
We double back, cut through Dining Hall B,
then we're right on track.

160
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:31,340
Sir, no go. The whole level's flooded.

161
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,843
All right, we're behind schedule.

162
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,970
So let's move it.

163
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,477
Come on.

164
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,069
Poor bastards.

165
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,452
Dining Hall B.

166
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,704
That's what it says on the map.

167
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,165
Maybe you're reading it wrong.

168
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:49,126
Maybe the corporation's
keeping a few secrets down here.

169
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,754
Something you're not supposed to see.

170
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:56,092
J.D., you and Rain keep the prisoner here
and secure the exit.

171
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,345
Sir, halon levels
are nonexistent in this room.

172
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,138
I think the system malfunctioned.

173
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,683
All right. There may be survivors.

174
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:06,352
Give me a search line, but keep it tight.

175
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,773
Move it.

176
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:05,703
- I said keep it tight.
- Sorry.

177
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,292
I'm not sure I want to remember
what went on down here.

178
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,505
I don't blame you.

179
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,842
<i>What do they keep in these things?</i>

180
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,427
<i>How do I know?</i>

181
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,662
What's taking so long?

182
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:53,292
Red Queen's defenses are in place.
She's making it difficult.

183
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,590
Let's pack it up.

184
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,437
You stay here.

185
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:50,099
<i>The lights are automated.
Nothing to worry about.</i>

186
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,787
- Transmitter in position.
- Roger.

187
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,622
Running the bypass.

188
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,810
Checkmate.

189
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:45,821
Move up.

190
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:54,580
- What is that?
- That's what will shut the Queen down.

191
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,498
Delivers a massive electrical charge.

192
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,835
Scrambles the mainframe
and forces it to reboot.

193
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,013
Some kind of dormant defense mechanism.

194
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,432
<i>- Opening the door tripped it.
- Put it back to sleep.</i>

195
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,100
Working on it.

196
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,606
- Would you open that door now, please?
- I'm trying.

197
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,692
<i>Hold your positions. Everyone stay calm.</i>

198
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,194
What's that?

199
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,530
- Kaplan, quick!
- We gotta get them out of there!

200
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,991
- Kaplan, you've gotta hurry!
- Come on!

201
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,702
Down! Get down!

202
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:38,082
- Look out! Something's killing them!
- Jesus! Come on, man.

203
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,917
Don't do this to me!

204
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:43,003
Medic! Medic!

205
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,472
- Open the door!
- Open this door!

206
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,599
- I am trying.
- Stay conscious.

207
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,185
You're going into shock. Stay awake!

208
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,689
- I am almost there.
- Sir! It's coming back!

209
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,482
- Open the door!
- I'm trying!

210
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,192
Well, try harder!

211
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,902
It's coming back!

212
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,996
Oh, God!

213
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,873
- Just do it!
- I'm almost there.

214
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,750
Come on!

215
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,963
- Shit!
- Got it.

216
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,573
All right.

217
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,742
Let's do it.

218
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,578
Do what?

219
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,621
We have to complete the mission.

220
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,332
There is no way I'm going down there.

221
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,419
Her defenses are down.

222
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,129
Déjé vu, anyone?

223
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:10,859
Keep going.

224
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,229
Give me a hand.

225
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,830
<i>Get out! Get out! You can't be in here.</i>

226
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,540
Don't listen to anything she says.

227
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,834
She's a holographic representation
of the Red Queen.

228
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,335
<i>You have to get out!</i>

229
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,838
Modeled after
the head programmer's daughter.

230
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,048
She'll try to deceive us, confuse us.

231
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:20,053
<i>I wouldn't advise this. Disabling me
will result in loss of primary power</i>

232
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:23,182
She'll say anything to stop us
from shutting her down.

233
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:24,766
<i>I implore you</i>

234
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,020
-implore away.
- Please?

235
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,065
<i>Please?</i>

236
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,111
<i>You're all going to die down here.</i>

237
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:41,134
That pulse forces the circuit breaker
to shut down her mainframe for 30 seconds.

238
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:44,680
After that, if I don't have her board,
she can reboot.

239
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:55,023
They're late.

240
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,701
I'm on it.

241
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:55,417
J.D., we got a survivor!

242
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,545
It's okay. We're here to help.

243
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,923
You seem to be in some serious...

244
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:09,264
Get off of me! Get off of me!

245
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:14,061
J.D., get her off of me before I stab her ass!

246
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,106
Are you okay?

247
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:23,320
She bit me, man.
She took a chunk clean right out of me.

248
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,323
Stay down.

249
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,700
I'm warning you, stay down!

250
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,202
She's crazy.

251
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:35,165
Come any closer, and I'll fire.

252
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,459
I mean it!

253
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,837
Damn you.

254
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:04,569
I shot her five times.
How was she still standing?

255
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,988
Bitch isn't standing now.

256
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:15,038
- What was all the shooting?
- We found a survivor.

257
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:19,626
- And you shot him?
- She was crazed. She bit me.

258
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,839
She's gone. She's gone!

259
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,591
That's bullshit!

260
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:29,177
She fell right here, but she's gone!

261
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,931
Look, look at this.

262
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,392
There's blood, but it's not much.

263
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,271
Looks like it's coagulated.

264
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,858
- Yeah.
- It's not possible.

265
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,526
Why not?

266
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,948
Because blood doesn't do that
till after you're dead.

267
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,074
Can we go now?

268
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:54,953
We're not going anywhere
till the rest of the team get here.

269
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:04,254
- There's no one else coming.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

270
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,422
Wait.

271
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:07,716
Quiet.

272
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:44,753
Fuck!

273
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,672
- Don't come any closer!
- They're behind us.

274
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,341
Jesus!

275
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,929
They're everywhere.

276
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:56,848
They're everywhere. They're all around us.

277
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:21,164
I said stay back!

278
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,092
Why aren't they dying?

279
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:43,812
Watch the tank! The tank!

280
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,446
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!

281
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,615
- Wait!
- Come on, let's go!

282
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,909
- Move!
- Keep moving! Come on!

283
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,039
Move!

284
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,095
I can help you get the virus.

285
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:21,725
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

286
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,077
Shit!

287
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,545
- We lost the others!
- Keep moving!

288
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,973
- You waited?
- Didn't know the code.

289
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,683
Come on, come on.

290
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,518
- Shit!
- Come on.

291
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,825
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

292
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,702
- Come on, man.
- Shit!

293
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:26,915
- What's taking so long?
- I'm trying!

294
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:44,974
Come on.

295
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,021
- Move! What's the code?
- Hurry up!

296
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,356
I'm running out of ammo!

297
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,817
Zero, four, three, two... No, fuck!

298
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:57,153
- What?
- Zero, four, three...

299
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:59,781
- What is the code?
- Zero, four,

300
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:03,702
zero, three, one, nine, six, five.

301
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,038
- Got it?
- See how easy that was?

302
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,000
- Shit!
- J.D., no!

303
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:16,297
Grab my hand, man! Come on!

304
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,049
Don't let go!

305
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,352
- J.D.!
- Rain!

306
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:21,613
Where are the bodies? Where did they go?

307
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:22,822
Fuck!

308
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,244
Whatever they are,
there's too many of them out there.

309
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:31,706
Whatever they are?
It's pretty obvious what they are.

310
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:35,877
Lab coats, badges.
Those people used to work here!

311
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,463
All the people working here are dead.

312
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:41,591
Well, that isn't stopping them
from walking around.

313
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:45,512
Well, where did they come from?
Why didn't we see them on the way in?

314
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:47,972
When you out the power,
you unlocked the doors.

315
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,933
You let them out.

316
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:02,403
We're never gonna make it to the surface.

317
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:05,151
<i>You are security operatives.</i>

318
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:08,863
Security operatives placed there
to protect that entrance.

319
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:07,834
I've got one in the breech and an extra mag.

320
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:35,361
Lisa.

321
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,807
I can help you get the virus.

322
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:09,187
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

323
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:10,980
But?

324
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,358
- But there's gonna be a price.
- Name it.

325
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,201
- Who was she?
- My sister.

326
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:37,465
Corporations like Umbrella
think they're above the law.

327
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,218
But they're not.

328
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:47,058
There are hundreds of thousands
of us who think the same

329
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,851
all over the world.

330
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:54,315
Some of us provide information,

331
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:57,568
others give their support.

332
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:00,988
Some take more direct action.

333
00:54:02,198 --> 00:54:03,491
Like you.

334
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,620
If your friends had been
a little more thorough,

335
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:10,665
they would've seen
right through my false ID.

336
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,253
Then all the red flags would've gone off...

337
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:18,881
Quantico, NSA, VICAP, all the rest.

338
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:23,344
There's no way
I could've infiltrated the Hive.

339
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:26,931
So you sent your sister.

340
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:33,479
We needed something concrete.

341
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:36,524
Anything to expose Umbrella to the press.

342
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,819
Proof of the research
that was going on down here.

343
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,446
What kind of research?

344
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,156
The illegal kind.

345
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,909
Genetic.

346
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,328
Viral.

347
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:57,670
My sister was going to smuggle out
a sample of the virus they were developing.

348
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:03,134
So how was she
going to make it out of here?

349
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:08,180
She had a contact within the Hive,
someone I never met.

350
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,977
They had access to security codes,
surveillance, everything she needed.

351
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:15,896
So why didn't she make it?

352
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,443
Maybe she trusted the wrong person.

353
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,362
Maybe they set her up.

354
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,282
Kept the virus for themselves.

355
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:32,204
Do you know how much the T-virus
would be worth on the open market?

356
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:36,542
- What, worth all this?
- Yeah.

357
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,044
To someone.

358
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:47,303
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

359
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:49,180
- Close that door!
- They're right behind us!

360
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,269
Get off! Get off!

361
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:56,604
Stop it!

362
00:55:58,356 --> 00:55:59,899
Son of a bitch!

363
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,777
- You okay?
- Yeah.

364
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:07,156
Right behind us. What about this door?

365
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:11,786
- They're waiting out there too.
- And that way?

366
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:15,414
It's a dead end.
There's no way out of the Queen's chamber.

367
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:16,916
So we wait.

368
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:20,586
If someone doesn't hear from you,
they'll send backup or something.

369
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:21,837
Right?

370
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:27,968
What? What's wrong?

371
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,388
We don't have much time.

372
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:34,683
You know those blast doors we passed
on the way in from the mansion?

373
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:37,520
They seal shut in just under an hour.

374
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:41,065
If we're not out of here by then,
we're not getting out.

375
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:45,486
What are you talking about?
They can't just bury us alive down here.

376
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:52,159
Containing the incident
is the only fail-safe plan they had

377
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:55,704
against possible contamination.

378
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:01,085
And you're only telling us this now,
when we're trapped

379
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,462
half a mile underground?

380
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:06,424
We have to find a way out of this room.

381
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,886
What are you doing?

382
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:17,017
- Where are you taking those?
- I'm turning her back on.

383
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:20,938
- That is not a good idea.
- She'll know a way out of here.

384
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,778
That homicidal bitch killed my team.

385
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:30,489
That homicidal bitch
may be our only way out of here.

386
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:34,952
Considering the way she's been treated,
I'm sure she'll be happy to help us out.

387
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,787
That circuit breaker you were talking about.

388
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,831
- Can you bypass it?
- Yeah.

389
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,207
So do it.

390
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:48,966
All right, circuit breaker is disabled.

391
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:52,636
This time if I hit the switch,
she won't be able to shut down.

392
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,054
She's gonna fry.

393
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:58,934
Kaplan?

394
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,645
The initial charge
must have damaged her boards.

395
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:04,064
<i>Ah, there you are.</i>

396
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:07,109
<i>Things, I gather, have gone out of control.</i>

397
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:10,988
Give me that fucking switch right now.
I'm gonna fry your ass.

398
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,073
<i>I did warn you, didn't I?</i>

399
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,451
Tell us what's going on down here.

400
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,703
<i>Research and development.</i>

401
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,371
What about the T-virus?

402
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:22,416
<i>The T-virus was
a major medical breakthrough</i>

403
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:28,047
<i>although it clearly also possessed
highly profitable military applications.</i>

404
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,257
How does it explain those things out there?

405
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:33,844
<i>Even in death,
the human body still remains active.</i>

406
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:36,430
<i>Hair and fingernails continue to grow.</i>

407
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,140
<i>New cells are produced</i>

408
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:41,393
<i>and the brain itself
holds a small electrical charge</i>

409
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:43,896
<i>that takes months to dissipate.</i>

410
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:48,859
<i>The T-virus provides a massive jolt
both to cellular growth</i>

411
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:51,904
<i>and to those trace electrical impulses.</i>

412
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:55,991
<i>Put quite simply it reanimates the body.</i>

413
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:58,786
It brings the dead back to life?

414
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,120
<i>Not fully.</i>

415
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:03,457
<i>The subjects have
the simplest of motor functions.</i>

416
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:07,878
<i>Perhaps a little memory.
Virtually no intelligence.</i>

417
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:12,967
<i>They are driven by the basest of impulses,
the most basic of needs.</i>

418
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:14,426
Which is?

419
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,095
<i>The need to feed.</i>

420
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:22,560
How do you kill them?

421
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:26,355
<i>Severing the top of the spinal column
or massive trauma to the brain</i>

422
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,857
<i>are the most effective methods.</i>

423
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:31,402
You mean shoot them in the head.

424
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,904
Why did you kill everybody down here?

425
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:37,575
<i>The T-virus escaped
into the air conditioning system</i>

426
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:40,744
<i>and an uncontrolled pattern
of infection began.</i>

427
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:43,247
<i>The virus is protean,</i>

428
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,792
<i>changing from liquid to airborne
to blood transmission</i>

429
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,295
<i>depending on its environment.</i>

430
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:51,839
<i>It's almost impossible to kill.</i>

431
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:57,678
<i>I couldn't allow it to escape from the Hive,
so I took steps.</i>

432
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:01,348
<i>- Steps.
- You must understand.</i>

433
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:04,935
<i>Those who become infected,
I can't allow you to leave.</i>

434
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,937
Whoa. We're not infected.

435
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:11,775
<i>Just one bite, one scratch
from these creatures is sufficient</i>

436
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:14,445
<i>and then you become one of them.</i>

437
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:20,951
<i>A check of my systems indicates
my main drive circuit breaker</i>

438
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:23,162
<i>has been disabled.</i>

439
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:24,747
<i>May I ask why?</i>

440
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:27,958
Insurance. We need a way out of here.

441
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:31,086
If you refuse to help at any time,
we flip the switch.

442
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,546
Understand?

443
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:44,725
After you.

444
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,488
- What the hell is this place?
- The utility tunnels.

445
01:00:57,571 --> 01:01:01,617
They run underneath the Hive
for water, gas and power lines.

446
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,632
- It's been in here before.
- Keep moving.

447
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:19,218
- We're going around in circles.
- This is the route the computer gave us.

448
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:22,012
- Why are you listening to her?
- Enough already!

449
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:26,767
We have no choice but to keep moving
'cause those things are right behind us.

450
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:35,484
That mesh isn't gonna hold. Keep moving.

451
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:41,657
Jesus Christ! Hold it!
There's too many of them!

452
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,661
- Jesus!
- Fuck!

453
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:01,885
Up on the pipes. Up on the pipes!

454
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:04,096
Quickly, everyone!

455
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,682
- Let's go!
- Come on! There's a way up!

456
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,642
Watch out! Keep them back!

457
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:11,979
Go on up! Move it!

458
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,152
Shit. Okay.

459
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:31,749
Get over here! There's too many of them!
Come on! Go, go, go!

460
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:33,876
Go on!

461
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:36,837
Go! Go! I can manage!

462
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:41,258
Gotcha!

463
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:22,883
Rain? Rain.

464
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:25,427
What?

465
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:28,305
We have to do something
about your wounds.

466
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,182
I'm fine.

467
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:33,769
I said I'm fine.

468
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:44,196
You like that, don't you? Huh?

469
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,741
You like the way it tastes, don't you?

470
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:51,912
Like the taste of that?

471
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,255
She was right.

472
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:06,343
We're all gonna die down here.

473
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,470
No. We're getting out.

474
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,014
All of us.

475
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,310
Kaplan, are you okay?

476
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:13,869
Oh, God!

477
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:25,589
Hold on!

478
01:05:38,185 --> 01:05:41,605
- Help him.
- I can't.

479
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:44,524
- What are you waiting for?
- I can't focus!

480
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:49,738
I can't see!

481
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:57,537
- Kaplan, go up!
- Get up there!

482
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,499
You almost got it. Keep going!

483
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:03,543
- Come on! Come on!
- You can do it!

484
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:06,046
You got it!

485
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,007
- Okay, Kaplan.
- Just stay there!

486
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:11,134
Hold on. We're gonna come get you.

487
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:14,888
Cut this wire and throw it to him.
Then we can go get him.

488
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:16,223
Hold on!

489
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:24,189
That's lucky.

490
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:28,735
I want you to go.

491
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:37,119
- We're not leaving you, Kaplan.
- Yes, you are.

492
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:39,246
- No.
- You can't kill all of them.

493
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:43,083
And I'm not going anywhere.

494
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:45,711
I want you to go. Now!

495
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,005
Please.

496
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,423
Just do it.

497
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:52,592
Just do it now!

498
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,469
Please.

499
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,764
Go!

500
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:28,128
You're gonna have to work for your meal!

501
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,078
Come on.

502
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:13,173
Give me your arm. Up over my shoulder.

503
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,550
Ready? There we go.

504
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:59,261
When I get out of here

505
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:02,889
I think I'm gonna get laid.

506
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:06,268
Yeah. You might want
to clean up a little bit first.

507
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,403
Hey, wait.

508
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,743
Are you okay?

509
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:12,500
Blue for the virus. Green for the antivirus.

510
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,713
Blue for the virus. Green for the antivirus.

511
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:21,009
- There's a cure.
- What are you talking about?

512
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,094
There's a cure.

513
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:26,640
The process can be reversed.

514
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:29,184
There's a cure!

515
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,102
You're gonna be okay!

516
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:34,439
I was beginning to worry.

517
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:44,824
This is where they kept the T-virus.

518
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:48,203
How do you know all this?

519
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:53,333
Because I was gonna steal it.

520
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,463
I was your sister's contact.

521
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:02,133
- You betrayed her.
- I don't know.

522
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:05,303
- You caused all of this.
- I can't remember.

523
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,097
The truth.

524
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,266
I don't remember the truth.

525
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,385
I don't understand!

526
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:49,889
It's gone.

527
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,183
It's not there.

528
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:54,728
I can't.

529
01:11:56,438 --> 01:11:57,939
I just can't.

530
01:11:58,023 --> 01:11:59,691
- It's over.
- No.

531
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:09,367
<i>I can help you get the virus.</i>

532
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:13,788
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

533
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:16,082
But there's gonna be a price.

534
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,626
Name it.

535
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:23,423
You have to guarantee me that
you will bring this corporation down.

536
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:43,151
Spence?

537
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,422
Thank you.

538
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:16,393
Spence?

539
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:45,338
We can still make it out of here.
Come with me.

540
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:50,218
We can have everything we've ever wanted.

541
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:55,849
Money's out there waiting.
You wouldn't believe how much.

542
01:13:56,683 --> 01:14:00,395
Is that how you thought
all my dreams were gonna come true?

543
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:05,191
Please. I wouldn't want to shoot you.

544
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,318
Might need the bullets.

545
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:10,864
Back off.

546
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:18,079
I won't take any part in this.

547
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:23,293
Okay, but you can't just
wash your hands of this.

548
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:26,588
We work for the same company.
You knew what they did.

549
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:28,256
I was trying to stop them.

550
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:31,926
You really believe that

551
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:37,098
people like him will ever change anything?

552
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:43,438
Nothing ever changes.

553
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:50,028
Where is the antivirus?

554
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:52,530
It's on the train

555
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,492
where you found me.

556
01:14:57,035 --> 01:15:00,580
Couldn't have been standing
more than three feet from it.

557
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:03,666
I so nearly made it out.

558
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:10,924
Didn't realize that bitch of a computer
had defense systems outside the Hive.

559
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:14,260
In or out?

560
01:15:15,637 --> 01:15:18,598
In or out?

561
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:22,852
I don't know what we had but it's over.

562
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,528
Back...

563
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:35,240
the fuck off.

564
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:48,795
I'm missing you already.

565
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:00,598
Your boyfriend's a real asshole.

566
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:02,892
He shot the locking mechanism out.

567
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:07,438
I can't believe that son of a bitch
is gonna get away with this.

568
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:09,148
<i>I don't think so.</i>

569
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:15,321
<i>I've been a bad, bad girl.</i>

570
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,799
Oh, my God.

571
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:34,817
What the fuck is that?

572
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:37,320
<i>One of the Hive's early experiments</i>

573
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:41,658
<i>produced by injecting the T-virus
directly into living tissue.</i>

574
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:44,452
<i>The results were unstable.</i>

575
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:48,373
<i>Now that it has fed on fresh DNA,
it will mutate...</i>

576
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:59,092
<i>becoming a stronger, faster hunter.</i>

577
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:00,927
Great.

578
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:05,223
If you knew it was loose,
why didn't you warn us?

579
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:09,060
'Cause she was saving it for us.

580
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,270
Isn't that right?

581
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:14,691
<i>I didn't think any of you
would make it this far.</i>

582
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:16,609
<i>Not without infection.</i>

583
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:19,654
Why didn't you tell us about the antivirus?

584
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:24,409
<i>This long after infection
there's no guarantee it would work.</i>

585
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:29,539
But there's a chance, right?

586
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,958
<i>I don't deal in chance.</i>

587
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:41,551
Fuck it.

588
01:18:52,562 --> 01:18:54,605
No pressure, guys.

589
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:58,151
<i>You require the four-digit access code.</i>

590
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:02,780
<i>I can give you the code,
but first you must do something for me.</i>

591
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:05,825
<i>- What do you want?
- One of your group is infected.</i>

592
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,911
<i>I require her life for the code.</i>

593
01:19:08,995 --> 01:19:12,039
The antivirus is right there on the platform.

594
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:14,250
- It's right there!
- I'm sorry.

595
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,544
<i>It's a risk I cannot take.</i>

596
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:23,342
She's right. It's the only way.

597
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:25,762
You're gonna have to kill me.

598
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:31,225
Otherwise we all die down here.

599
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:42,195
<i>The glass is reinforced
but it won't hold forever.</i>

600
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,117
- Do it.
- No.

601
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:50,244
- Get up.
- Just do it.

602
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:51,788
- Rain, please get up.
- Do it!

603
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:54,499
<i>- You don't have long to decide.
- Get up, please.</i>

604
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:56,250
- You have no choice.
<i>- Kill</i> her.

605
01:19:56,334 --> 01:19:59,712
<i>Kill her now. You don't have any choice.</i>

606
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:02,173
- Just do it now!
- I can't!

607
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:04,550
- Please.
- Do it.

608
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:06,344
<i>- Kill her.
- Just do it.</i>

609
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:08,054
<i>Kill her now!</i>

610
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:12,058
<i>Kill her!</i>

611
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:45,424
The bitch wouldn't open the door,
so I had to fry her.

612
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:48,678
Move.

613
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:00,940
- What the fuck was that?
- It's a long story.

614
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,169
Start it up.

615
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:24,630
I'll get the virus.

616
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,668
I'm missing you already.

617
01:22:08,049 --> 01:22:10,009
Okay, we're in business.

618
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:12,637
Full power.

619
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,388
We're leaving!

620
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:34,116
I don't want to be one of those things

621
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:40,081
walking around without a soul.

622
01:22:41,499 --> 01:22:42,833
You won't.

623
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:45,753
When the time comes

624
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:48,923
you'll take care of it.

625
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,636
No one else is gonna die.

626
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:56,472
Okay?

627
01:23:05,356 --> 01:23:06,440
Here.

628
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:12,506
I'm not dead yet.

629
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:15,843
I think I'll have that back.

630
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:21,265
I could kiss you, you bitch.

631
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:27,980
What's going on back there?

632
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:43,954
- Get us the fuck out of here!
- Any faster, we'll come off the rails!

633
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:01,991
Open the doors!

634
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:27,141
Open the doors!

635
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:28,434
Now!

636
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:16,458
I failed all of them.

637
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:19,753
I failed.

638
01:28:22,006 --> 01:28:23,424
Listen to me.

639
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:25,843
There is nothing else you could've done.

640
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:28,804
The corporation's guilty here, not you.

641
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:31,307
And we finally have the proof.

642
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:33,600
That way Umbrella can't get...

643
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:36,145
get away with this.

644
01:28:39,732 --> 01:28:41,066
What is it?

645
01:28:43,777 --> 01:28:45,863
You're infected, but you're gonna be okay.

646
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:47,948
I'm not losing you.

647
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,166
Help!

648
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:59,543
Help him. What are you doing?

649
01:29:11,972 --> 01:29:13,265
Matt!

650
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:15,601
<i>He's mutating.</i>

651
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:19,938
<i>I want him in the Nemesis Program.</i>

652
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:25,110
Get off!

653
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,613
What's happening?

654
01:29:33,202 --> 01:29:34,370
Matt!

655
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:54,223
<i>I want her quarantined.</i>

656
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:57,601
<i>Close observation
and a full series of blood tests.</i>

657
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,730
<i>Let's see if she's infected.</i>

658
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:04,858
<i>Take her to the Raccoon City facility.</i>

659
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:07,569
<i>Then assemble the team.</i>

660
01:30:07,653 --> 01:30:09,655
<i>We're reopening the Hive.</i>

661
01:30:10,364 --> 01:30:12,825
<i>I want to know what went on down there.</i>

662
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:15,661
<i>Just do it.</i>

663
01:31:27,566 --> 01:31:29,193
Who's in there?

664
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:32,946
Let me out!

665
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:35,407
Let me out!

666
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:38,619
Who's in there?
