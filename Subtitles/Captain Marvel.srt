3
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:16,712
Do you know
what time it is?

4
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:18,545
Can't sleep.

5
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:20,814
There are tabs
for that.

6
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:22,618
Yeah, but then
I'd be sleeping.

7
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:24,686
Dreams again?

8
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:30,559
Wanna fight?

9
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,328
I slipped.

10
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,263
Right, you slipped

11
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:38,265
as a result of me
punching you in the face.

12
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:39,164
I was already slipping

13
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,433
when you happened
to punch me in the face.

14
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:42,036
The two events
were not related.

15
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:43,605
Tell me about this dream.

16
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,644
- Anything new?
- No.

17
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:54,614
You have to let go
of the past.

18
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:55,882
I don't remember my past.

19
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,551
It's causing you doubt,

20
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,354
and doubt
makes you vulnerable.

21
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:08,564
Control it.

22
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:12,432
Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune

23
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:13,900
with the
Supreme Intelligence.

24
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,772
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

25
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,076
Humor is a distraction.

26
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:26,279
And anger?

27
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:27,716
Anger only serves
the enemy.

28
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:40,560
<i>One hundred twenty days</i>

29
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:42,596
<i>since the last Skrull attack.</i>

30
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:43,930
<i>Has anyone ever seen</i>

31
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,765
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?

32
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,535
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence

33
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:49,805
in its true form.

34
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:52,906
You know that.

35
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:55,642
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

36
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:59,178
So it's sacred.
It's personal.

37
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,314
No Kree divulges it, ever.

38
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:02,317
Who do you see?

39
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:04,484
- Your brother?
- No.

40
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:05,752
- Father?
- No.

41
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:07,921
- Your old commander?
- Vers.

42
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,324
It's me you see,
isn't it?

43
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,325
I see
what you're trying to do.

44
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:13,793
- Is it working?
- Yes.

45
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,662
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

46
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:18,264
What is the point
of giving me these...

47
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:19,966
if you don't want me
to use them?

48
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,835
I want you to use them.

49
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:23,737
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...

50
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:25,705
of showing you
how to use them.

51
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:26,573
I know how.

52
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:27,874
Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to

53
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:28,956
knock me down without them.

54
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:32,681
Control your impulses.

55
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:36,816
Stop using this,
start using this.

56
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,822
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

57
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,197
Vers.

58
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:25,965
Intelligence.

59
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:29,035
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

60
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,704
I am.

61
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:34,307
You struggle
with your emotions...

62
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:36,678
with your past,
which fuels them.

63
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,614
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...

64
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:44,818
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.

65
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,887
Imposters
who silently infiltrate...

66
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,891
then take over our planets.

67
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,593
Horrors that you remember...

68
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:56,231
and so much that you do not.

69
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:03,636
It's all blank.
My life.

70
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:05,338
You're supposed
to take the form

71
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,006
of who I most admire...

72
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:11,644
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

73
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:13,713
Perhaps this is a mercy

74
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:16,649
sparing you
from a deeper pain.

75
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:20,553
Freeing you to do
what all Kree must...

76
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:23,056
put your people's needs
before your own.

77
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:25,592
We've given you
a great gift.

78
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,029
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.

79
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,864
I want to serve.

80
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:32,932
Then master yourself.

81
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,604
What was given
can be taken away.

82
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:41,074
I won't let you down.

83
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:43,311
We'll know soon enough.

84
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:45,380
You have a mission.

85
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:49,050
Serve well, and with honor.

86
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,671
This can't be good.

87
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:13,706
Must be another
Skrull attack.

88
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,043
Whatever it is, it's big.

89
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:17,577
Has a Skrull
ever simmed you?

90
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,745
Once.

91
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:21,114
- It was deeply disturbing.
- Why?

92
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:23,516
Because I stared into the
face of my mortal enemy...

93
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:25,752
and the face staring back
was my own.

94
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:26,953
Maybe if you were
more attractive,

95
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:28,588
then it would be
less disturbing.

96
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,690
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.

97
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:31,925
You never laugh.

98
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:34,994
I laugh on the inside.

99
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,396
I'm not doing that now.

100
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:37,564
It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,

101
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:38,765
you're quite handsome.

102
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:39,966
Well, thank you.

103
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:42,569
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.

104
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:43,605
All right.

105
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,473
Prepare for...

106
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:50,410
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

107
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:53,680
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

108
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,648
This time, Torfa.

109
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,749
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

110
00:07:56,751 --> 00:08:00,055
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.

111
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,623
The Skrull general, Talos,

112
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,491
has sent kill units
to find him.

113
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,060
Should they reach him
before we do...

114
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:08,461
the intelligence
he's acquired

115
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:10,031
over three years
is as good as theirs.

116
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,966
The Accusers will bomb

117
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:15,068
a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.

118
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,538
We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...

119
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,674
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.

120
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:23,943
The Torfan populace.

121
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:25,445
We are not to interfere
with them,

122
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:26,446
nor them with us.

123
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:29,983
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

124
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:31,985
Proceed with caution.

125
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:34,155
Follow protocol
before extracting him.

126
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,624
This is
a dangerous mission.

127
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:40,560
We must all be ready
to join the Collective

128
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,028
if that is our fate today.

129
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,162
For the good of all Kree.

130
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:44,324
For the good
of all Kree!

131
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:57,103
Vers,
track Soh-Larr's beacon.

132
00:09:57,105 --> 00:09:59,808
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.

133
00:10:18,793 --> 00:10:20,153
Locals on the periphery.

134
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,595
Maybe a dozen.

135
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:24,030
Minn-Erva?

136
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:28,069
Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?

137
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,069
Repeat.

138
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:46,185
His beacon's coming from
that temple. Let's move.

139
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,788
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.

140
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,023
Only one way in,
only one way out.

141
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,758
We can get past the locals.

142
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,361
We don't know if they are locals.
Too risky.

143
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,762
You don't have to go
with me. I'll go alone.

144
00:10:55,764 --> 00:10:56,765
No, you won't.

145
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,903
Right. We keep a close radius.

146
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,940
We lose comms,
we meet back at the <i>Helion.</i>

147
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:08,176
Come on.

148
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:21,988
Att-Lass, you getting this?

149
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,292
Copy. I see them.

150
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,669
Get back!

151
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,238
Commander?

152
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:46,846
Get back! Back!

153
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:49,617
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?

154
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:52,852
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

155
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:54,656
Does anybody copy?

156
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,028
I don't wanna hurt you.

157
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:03,865
Keep back!

158
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,270
Stay back!

159
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:15,041
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.

160
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,744
They're just starving.

161
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:43,936
HGX-78.

162
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:46,741
TRT79-VVX6.

163
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:51,146
Get back.

164
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:00,389
Skrulls!

165
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,273
Vers!

166
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:21,475
<i>Vers? Skrulls.</i>

167
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:23,345
<i>It's an ambush.</i>

168
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:43,365
Incoming!

169
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,370
Back to the <i>Helion.</i>

170
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,706
<i>Vers. Do you copy?</i>

171
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:54,308
<i>Back to the</i> Helion.

172
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,542
<i>Come in. Vers.</i>

173
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,077
How did you know the code?

174
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,316
How about
I tell you my secret...

175
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,353
when you've told me yours?

176
00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:09,391
<i>Let's open her up.</i>

177
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,036
<i>Where are we?</i>

178
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:25,374
<i>Stand by.</i>

179
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,377
Where's your head at?

180
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,911
In the clouds.
Where's yours?

181
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,413
On my shoulders.

182
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,249
About to show these boys
how we do it.

183
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:36,816
You ready?

184
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:37,883
Higher, further,
faster, baby.

185
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:38,886
That's right.

186
00:14:48,863 --> 00:14:50,198
<i>This can't be right.</i>

187
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,066
<i>Go back even further.</i>

188
00:14:57,306 --> 00:15:00,141
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

189
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,290
<i>Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?</i>

190
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:17,424
What the hell
are you thinking?

191
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,458
You don't belong out here!

192
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,159
<i>I think
we went back too far.</i>

193
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:21,561
You let him drive.

194
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:23,064
<i>Let me try something.</i>

195
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:26,866
Give up already!

196
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:28,370
You don't belong out here!

197
00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:33,105
You're not strong enough.

198
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:34,376
You'll kill yourself.

199
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:42,014
They'll never let you fly.

200
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:44,418
<i>Am I the only one
that's confused here?</i>

201
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,653
You're a decent pilot.

202
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:47,688
But you're too emotional.

203
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,956
You do know why they call it
a cockpit, don't you?

204
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,468
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

205
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,571
and the sun and the stars
in the sky.

206
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:05,539
And so,

207
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,174
little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.

208
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,510
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

209
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:14,146
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.

210
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:16,416
Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.

211
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:17,651
<i>Charming memory.</i>

212
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:18,984
<i>Hang on.</i>

213
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:20,289
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

214
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:26,526
Goose likes you.

215
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,160
She doesn't typically
take to people.

216
00:16:28,162 --> 00:16:29,563
Early start to your morning.

217
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:30,996
Uh, late night, actually.

218
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:33,065
I can't sleep
when there's work to do.

219
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:33,999
Sound familiar?

220
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:35,604
Flying your planes
never feels like work.

221
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:38,705
Wonderful view, isn't it?

222
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,940
I prefer the view
from up there.

223
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:42,242
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

224
00:16:42,244 --> 00:16:44,378
<i>Wait! Wait, wait!
That's her. Get her back.</i>

225
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,080
<i>Stand by.</i>

226
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:51,117
Sound familiar?

227
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,488
Wonderful view, isn't it?

228
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,523
I prefer the view
from up there.

229
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:57,957
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

230
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,058
<i>What's that
on her shirt?</i>

231
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,262
<i>I couldn't read it.</i>

232
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:03,565
Wonderful view, isn't it?

233
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:08,502
I prefer the view
from up there.

234
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:11,103
<i>- Focus.</i>
- Excuse me?

235
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:12,972
<i>Look down.</i>

236
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:15,007
<i>Focus.</i>

237
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,677
<i>"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson."
That's her.</i>

238
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,645
Do you hear that, too?

239
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:20,282
<i>Do we have
her location?</i>

240
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:23,949
<i>Got it.</i>

241
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:26,355
<i>Now track Lawson until
we find the energy signature.</i>

242
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:32,294
<i>Interesting.</i>

243
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:36,396
<i>Huh. Hold on.</i>

244
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:39,201
<i>Go back right before this.
Go back.</i>

245
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:42,769
That's no MiG, Lawson.

246
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,405
<i>This is it.
Now let me see where you're headed.</i>

247
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:47,576
<i>That's right.
Look at the coordinates.</i>

248
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,645
<i>Focus.</i>

249
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,280
<i>Open, please.</i>

250
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:54,648
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>

251
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,715
<i>You're almost there.</i>

252
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:57,586
<i>You're almost there.
Don't fight it.</i>

253
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:00,522
<i>Focus!</i>

254
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:04,025
<i>Get her back!
Get her back now!</i>

255
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,095
This doesn't make any sense.

256
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:29,316
Do we have any information
we can act on?

257
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:32,117
Just that Lawson was
somewhere on planet C-53.

258
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,253
We're on our way.

259
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:36,121
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

260
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:39,294
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

261
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:41,996
And everything we're after.

262
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:50,572
Oh!

263
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,839
That did something.

264
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,276
Try that again.

265
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:06,788
Not yet!

266
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:18,532
What did you do to me?

267
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,500
Now we're just after
a little information.

268
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:22,202
What did you put in my head?

269
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,105
Nothing that wasn't
already there.

270
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,207
But those aren't my memories.

271
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,743
Yeah, it's like a bad trip,
isn't it?

272
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:32,245
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.

273
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:34,447
They really did
a number on you.

274
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:35,615
Enough of your mind games.

275
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:37,517
What do you want?

276
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:41,788
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...

277
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,557
and her light-speed engine.

278
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,425
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

279
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:49,063
Really? Then why is she
in your head?

280
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:21,160
You guys
wouldn't happen to know

281
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:22,562
how these things come off,
would ya?

282
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:23,797
No?

283
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,199
Fine.

284
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:48,890
Hmm.

285
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:57,859
Hey.

286
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:05,378
<i>You do
know why they call it a...</i>

287
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,784
You leaving so soon?

288
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:26,321
We're just getting to know
each other.

289
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:52,707
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?

290
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,579
Hello? Do you copy?

291
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,008
Hi. I'm Vers.
Kree Starforce.

292
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,345
Is this C-53?

293
00:24:32,814 --> 00:24:35,582
Do you understand me? Is my
universal translator working?

294
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,851
Yeah. I understand you.

295
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:38,918
Oh, good.

296
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,956
Are you in charge of security
for this district?

297
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:45,627
Sort of. Uh,
the movie theater has its own guy.

298
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:48,897
Where can I find
communications equipment?

299
00:24:56,004 --> 00:24:57,105
Thank you.

300
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:32,140
Track the pod.
Find the girl.

301
00:25:33,174 --> 00:25:35,777
She knows more
than she knows.

302
00:25:38,046 --> 00:25:39,114
Hey.

303
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:41,816
This one's taken.

304
00:25:52,494 --> 00:25:54,093
Come on.

305
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,262
<i>Vers?</i>

306
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:56,531
Vers?

307
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:59,199
Verify. CTC-39.

308
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:00,667
<i>GRXV-1600.</i>

309
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:02,029
<i>And I'm fine,
thank you for asking.</i>

310
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,570
<i>Is everyone okay?
What happened?</i>

311
00:26:04,572 --> 00:26:06,539
Skrull ambush.

312
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,141
I thought we'd lost you.

313
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:09,276
Did you find Soh-Larr?

314
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:10,777
<i>It wasn't Soh-Larr.</i>

315
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,845
<i>Talos simmed him.
Even knew his code.</i>

316
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:15,081
That's impossible.

317
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,083
That code was buried
in his unconscious.

318
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:18,651
The Skrulls
messed with my mind.

319
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:19,752
The machine that they used...

320
00:26:19,754 --> 00:26:22,155
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

321
00:26:22,157 --> 00:26:23,290
Vers, where are you?

322
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,692
<i>I'm on planet C-53.</i>

323
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:28,094
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.

324
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:29,696
<i>Who?</i>

325
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:32,932
She's who I see.

326
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,636
<i>She's what?</i>

327
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:36,638
<i>Vers?</i>

328
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:38,707
Vers, what?

329
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,308
She's a scientist.

330
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,543
They think that she's cracked
the code on light-speed tech.

331
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:45,144
I have to get to her
before they do...

332
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:46,846
<i>or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.</i>

333
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:48,650
No. You've been
caught once already.

334
00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:52,018
How far is C-53?

335
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,721
Closest jump point
is 22 hours.

336
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:56,856
<i>Vers, hold your
position until we get there.</i>

337
00:26:56,858 --> 00:26:58,925
<i>Keep your comms online
so we can contact you.</i>

338
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,893
No! What if they get
a hold of it before...

339
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:01,995
<i>We're sorry.</i>

340
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,162
<i>A long-distance
company access code</i>

341
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:03,663
<i>is required for the number
you have dialed.</i>

342
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,867
- Yon-Rogg?
- Vers?

343
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:08,402
Vers?

344
00:27:08,404 --> 00:27:09,902
<i>Please dial your call
with the access code.</i>

345
00:27:09,904 --> 00:27:12,005
Vers?

346
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,841
If the Skrulls got
to her, she's compromised.

347
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,845
She's stronger
than you think.

348
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:19,681
Ever been to C-53?

349
00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:21,283
Once.

350
00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:24,251
It's a real shithole.

351
00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:37,699
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

352
00:27:44,773 --> 00:27:46,208
Did you call this in?

353
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:02,275
<i>Beacon activated.</i>

354
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:06,926
Excuse me, miss.

355
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:09,363
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole...

356
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:12,832
through the roof of that
Blockbuster over there?

357
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:15,337
Witness says
she was dressed for laser tag.

358
00:28:16,838 --> 00:28:18,238
Oh.

359
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,907
Yeah, I think
she went that way.

360
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,244
Uh, I'd like to ask you
some questions.

361
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:28,748
Maybe give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

362
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,750
Could I see
some identification, please?

363
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,252
Vers. Kree Starforce.

364
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:33,353
We don't carry
our identification

365
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:34,421
on little cards.

366
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:35,623
Vers?

367
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,126
Starforce?

368
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:41,094
How long you plan
to be in town?

369
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,262
oh, I'll be
out of your hair...

370
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:43,729
as soon as I track down
the Skrulls

371
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:45,301
that are infiltrating
your planet.

372
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:47,669
Skrulls?

373
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:49,236
Shapeshifters?

374
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:52,308
They can transform into any
life-form down to the DNA.

375
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,975
Oh, boy. You guys don't have
any clue, do you?

376
00:28:55,977 --> 00:28:58,878
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

377
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,251
How do we know you're not
one of those shapeshifters?

378
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:06,220
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

379
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:08,288
You have finally asked
a relevant question.

380
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,391
No! Congratulations to you,
Starforce lady.

381
00:29:11,393 --> 00:29:13,661
You're under arrest.

382
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:22,704
Rook!

383
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:24,806
Rook, let's roll!

384
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:35,815
Did you see her weapon?

385
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,916
I did not.

386
00:29:46,861 --> 00:29:47,962
Watch it!

387
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:22,997
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

388
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,854
"Trust me,
true believer." "Trust me."

389
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:53,995
"Trust me, true believer."

390
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,109
Get off!

391
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:38,500
Train's heading
for a tunnel up ahead.

392
00:32:41,537 --> 00:32:43,505
Let's greet them
at the station.

393
00:32:55,149 --> 00:32:57,151
<i>Mr. Fury,
this is Agent Coulson.</i>

394
00:32:58,253 --> 00:33:00,188
Uh, I'm still here
at the Blockbuster.

395
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:04,056
And, uh,
where'd everybody go?

396
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:06,060
<i>I finished
collecting evidence...</i>

397
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:35,615
We need an ambulance!

398
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:37,082
Someone call 911!

399
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:38,618
Hey! You all right?

400
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,620
Oh, my gosh!
Is everyone okay?

401
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:41,588
Anyone else see that?

402
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,325
Official S.H.I.E.L.D.
activity. Stay back.

403
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:35,509
Nice scuba suit.

404
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:42,616
Lighten up, honey, huh?

405
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:44,486
Got a smile for me?

406
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,024
Freak.

407
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:13,178
All life on Earth
is carbon-based. Not this guy.

408
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,549
Whatever he runs on,

409
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:17,116
it's not
on the periodic table.

410
00:36:17,118 --> 00:36:19,588
You're saying
he's not from around here?

411
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:21,657
Hey, how's your eye?

412
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:25,157
Well, I'd say fine...

413
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:27,462
but it can't believe
what it's seeing.

414
00:36:30,164 --> 00:36:35,302
You say this thing
looked like Coulson?

415
00:36:35,304 --> 00:36:37,337
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

416
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:40,240
And the woman said
that there were more?

417
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:42,309
The word she used
was "infiltration."

418
00:36:42,311 --> 00:36:43,476
You believe her?

419
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:45,779
Not till I saw this.

420
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:48,848
What's your plan?

421
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,817
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

422
00:36:50,819 --> 00:36:53,219
I got word
on a motorcycle thief

423
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:55,154
that fits her description.

424
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:57,891
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...

425
00:36:57,893 --> 00:37:00,327
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.

426
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:01,330
Good.

427
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:05,166
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.

428
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,401
Not even our own men.

429
00:37:08,403 --> 00:37:09,605
Yes, sir.

430
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:27,253
Wow. They're ugly bastards,
aren't they?

431
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:30,759
Yeah,
well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

432
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:38,199
Safe journey to the beyond,
my friend.

433
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:42,871
I will finish
what we started.

434
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:53,548
I wouldn't get
too close there, boss.

435
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,319
No one in or out.

436
00:38:32,921 --> 00:38:34,254
Boom!

437
00:38:59,448 --> 00:39:00,880
What can I get ya?

438
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:02,451
Where was
this photograph taken?

439
00:39:03,418 --> 00:39:04,617
An airport.

440
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:05,952
Where's Pegasus?

441
00:39:05,954 --> 00:39:08,021
That's classified.

442
00:39:08,023 --> 00:39:11,393
Not unlike the file
I started on you.

443
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:15,695
But I see you've changed
it up a bit since then.

444
00:39:15,697 --> 00:39:17,530
Grunge is a good look
for you.

445
00:39:17,532 --> 00:39:19,065
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?

446
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,767
It was cool, you know?

447
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:23,737
Had a space invasion,
big car chase.

448
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:27,774
Got to watch
an alien autopsy.

449
00:39:27,776 --> 00:39:29,509
Typical nine-to-five.

450
00:39:29,511 --> 00:39:30,443
So you saw one?

451
00:39:30,445 --> 00:39:33,415
I was never one
to believe in aliens...

452
00:39:34,382 --> 00:39:36,616
but I can't unsee that.

453
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:39,319
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask.

454
00:39:39,321 --> 00:39:41,688
You think I'm one of
those green things.

455
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,056
Can't be too careful.

456
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:48,027
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.

457
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:49,562
I'm afraid
I'm gonna need proof.

458
00:39:49,564 --> 00:39:51,664
We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?

459
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:53,600
No. The DNA would match.

460
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:54,801
Want my AOL password?

461
00:39:54,803 --> 00:39:56,836
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories

462
00:39:56,838 --> 00:39:58,840
- of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.

463
00:40:00,008 --> 00:40:01,941
You wanna get personal.

464
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:03,843
- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.

465
00:40:03,845 --> 00:40:05,478
But technically,
I don't remember that part.

466
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,946
- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snoofers.

467
00:40:06,948 --> 00:40:08,448
- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said.

468
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,516
Do I pass?

469
00:40:09,518 --> 00:40:10,917
Not yet. First job?

470
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:12,786
Soldier. Straight out of
high school.

471
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,053
Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.

472
00:40:14,055 --> 00:40:15,421
- Then?
- Spy.

473
00:40:15,423 --> 00:40:16,556
- Where?
- It was the Cold War.

474
00:40:16,558 --> 00:40:17,791
We were everywhere.

475
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:20,660
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.

476
00:40:20,662 --> 00:40:22,395
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.

477
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:23,563
- Now?
- Been riding a desk

478
00:40:23,565 --> 00:40:24,664
for the past six years...

479
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:25,765
trying to figure out
where our

480
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:26,833
future enemies
are coming from.

481
00:40:26,835 --> 00:40:28,034
Never occurred to me

482
00:40:28,036 --> 00:40:30,570
they would be coming
from above.

483
00:40:30,572 --> 00:40:31,905
Name a detail so bizarre

484
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:33,341
a Skrull could never
fabricate it.

485
00:40:35,677 --> 00:40:39,414
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.

486
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:42,849
You didn't need that,
did you?

487
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:44,586
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

488
00:40:45,086 --> 00:40:46,920
Okay. Your turn.

489
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:48,657
Prove you're not a Skrull.

490
00:40:57,132 --> 00:40:59,833
And how is that
supposed to prove to me

491
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:01,134
you're not a Skrull?

492
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:02,537
That's a photon blast.

493
00:41:02,771 --> 00:41:03,970
And?

494
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:04,973
A Skrull can't do that.

495
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:07,440
So, a full bird colonel

496
00:41:07,442 --> 00:41:08,708
turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

497
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,079
must have pretty high
security clearance.

498
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:12,781
Where's Pegasus?

499
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,521
Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races

500
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:23,456
to infiltrate
and take over planets.

501
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:27,627
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?

502
00:41:27,629 --> 00:41:30,163
Heroes.
Noble warrior heroes.

503
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:33,835
So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?

504
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,003
They believe
that she developed

505
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:39,005
a light-speed engine
at Pegasus.

506
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:40,642
Light-speed engine?

507
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,042
Gotta admit, that's not

508
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:44,611
the craziest thing
I've heard today.

509
00:41:44,613 --> 00:41:46,213
Well, it's still early.

510
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:48,481
And you,
what do you want?

511
00:41:48,483 --> 00:41:50,783
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

512
00:41:50,785 --> 00:41:51,786
And?

513
00:41:55,924 --> 00:41:59,492
Look, war is
a universal language.

514
00:41:59,494 --> 00:42:02,195
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.

515
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:04,599
You got a personal stake
in this.

516
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:16,509
<i>This is government property.</i>

517
00:42:16,511 --> 00:42:18,511
<i>Turn your vehicle around.</i>

518
00:42:18,513 --> 00:42:21,681
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

519
00:42:21,683 --> 00:42:23,818
<i>Place your thumb on the pad.</i>

520
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,753
<i>One moment.</i>

521
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:30,890
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?

522
00:42:30,892 --> 00:42:32,625
Everybody calls me Fury.

523
00:42:32,627 --> 00:42:36,663
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph.
Not Nick. Just Fury.

524
00:42:36,665 --> 00:42:38,131
- What does your mom call you?
- Fury.

525
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:39,866
- What do you call her?
- Fury.

526
00:42:39,868 --> 00:42:41,034
What about your kids?

527
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:42,969
If I have them,
they'll call me Fury.

528
00:42:42,971 --> 00:42:44,204
<i>You are cleared
for access.</i>

529
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:45,207
Thank you.

530
00:43:15,237 --> 00:43:17,036
Oh, hold up.

531
00:43:17,038 --> 00:43:19,774
You look like somebody's
disaffected niece.

532
00:43:21,776 --> 00:43:22,777
Put that on.

533
00:43:24,213 --> 00:43:26,246
- What is it?
- It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

534
00:43:26,248 --> 00:43:29,048
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing

535
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,783
help with the covert part
of your job?

536
00:43:30,785 --> 00:43:32,988
Said the space soldier who
was wearing a rubber suit.

537
00:43:34,055 --> 00:43:35,190
Lose the flannel.

538
00:43:46,268 --> 00:43:48,302
How can I help you?

539
00:43:48,304 --> 00:43:50,505
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

540
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,941
We're looking for a woman
named Lawson.

541
00:43:54,943 --> 00:43:57,145
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

542
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,181
Do you know her?

543
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:05,820
Follow me.

544
00:44:06,322 --> 00:44:07,522
Hmm.

545
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:13,528
You familiar with the phrase
"welcome wagon"?

546
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,530
No.

547
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:19,000
Well, this ain't it.

548
00:44:26,242 --> 00:44:27,640
Is that a communicator?

549
00:44:27,642 --> 00:44:31,010
Yeah. State-of-the-art
two-way pager.

550
00:44:31,012 --> 00:44:32,212
Who are you paging?

551
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:35,950
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

552
00:45:14,656 --> 00:45:15,788
After you.

553
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,424
Impressive.

554
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:20,195
Oh, you should see what I
can do with a paperclip.

555
00:45:30,905 --> 00:45:33,174
Hey, there. How are you?

556
00:45:35,043 --> 00:45:38,044
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.

557
00:45:38,046 --> 00:45:40,680
Aren't you
the cutest little thing?

558
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:42,915
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?

559
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:44,050
What's your name?

560
00:45:44,052 --> 00:45:46,953
"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.

561
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:47,956
Fury?

562
00:45:48,224 --> 00:45:49,225
Hmm?

563
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,794
I'll be back.

564
00:45:56,064 --> 00:45:58,332
Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.

565
00:45:58,334 --> 00:45:59,901
Just let me unravel
this puppy.

566
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:06,706
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?

567
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:07,840
When all you had to do was...

568
00:46:07,842 --> 00:46:09,245
I didn't wanna steal
your thunder.

569
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:28,397
Huh. Lawson.

570
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:41,743
Lawson's plan
for the light-speed engine.

571
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:45,178
I wonder why
they terminated the project.

572
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,684
Um, maybe because
she's cuckoo.

573
00:46:52,153 --> 00:46:53,289
Kree glyphs?

574
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:54,923
Hmm?

575
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:57,892
Lawson is not cuckoo.

576
00:47:00,161 --> 00:47:01,994
She's Kree.

577
00:47:01,996 --> 00:47:04,498
Well, she's dead.

578
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,165
What?

579
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:07,967
She crashed
the Asis aircraft

580
00:47:07,969 --> 00:47:10,036
doing an unauthorized
test flight.

581
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:12,138
Took a pilot down
with her.

582
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,408
That's why security here
is so unfriendly.

583
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,446
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.

584
00:47:19,113 --> 00:47:21,883
Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.

585
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:26,921
When did this crash happen?

586
00:47:27,556 --> 00:47:30,792
Six years ago. 1989.

587
00:47:31,926 --> 00:47:34,126
Who was the pilot?

588
00:47:34,128 --> 00:47:37,397
Um, most of
this thing's redacted...

589
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:41,867
but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.

590
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:43,905
Last person
to see them alive.

591
00:47:49,177 --> 00:47:50,312
You okay?

592
00:47:52,146 --> 00:47:53,282
Mm-hmm.

593
00:47:54,949 --> 00:47:56,184
Back in a minute.

594
00:48:26,248 --> 00:48:28,482
This isn't about
fighting wars.

595
00:48:28,484 --> 00:48:30,084
It's about ending them.

596
00:48:36,157 --> 00:48:37,890
<i>I know Lawson was Kree.</i>

597
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:40,960
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

598
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:43,597
<i>Do you know anything
about this?</i>

599
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,332
I just discovered
a mission report

600
00:48:45,334 --> 00:48:47,166
sent from C-53.

601
00:48:47,168 --> 00:48:48,268
There's only so much

602
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,972
I'm cleared to tell you,
Vers, but...

603
00:48:54,576 --> 00:48:58,978
<i>Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.</i>

604
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,582
She was working
on a unique energy core.

605
00:49:02,584 --> 00:49:04,083
Experimenting with tech

606
00:49:04,085 --> 00:49:06,954
that apparently could
help us win the war.

607
00:49:13,629 --> 00:49:15,094
She still here?

608
00:49:15,096 --> 00:49:17,597
She's cooperating
with the investigation, sir.

609
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,633
- You men stay here.
- Yes, sir.

610
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:21,603
I want to
question her alone.

611
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:25,574
Excellent work, Nicholas.

612
00:49:29,345 --> 00:49:31,345
Does it say anything
about me?

613
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:33,213
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

614
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:34,146
<i>Why would it?</i>

615
00:49:34,148 --> 00:49:37,584
I found evidence
that I had a life here.

616
00:49:37,586 --> 00:49:39,288
<i>On C-53?</i>

617
00:49:41,623 --> 00:49:43,189
Mar-Vell is who I see

618
00:49:43,191 --> 00:49:44,624
when I visit
the Supreme Intelligence.

619
00:49:44,626 --> 00:49:48,094
I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.

620
00:49:48,096 --> 00:49:50,430
This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.

621
00:49:50,432 --> 00:49:52,399
No, it's not. Because I remember.
I was here.

622
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:54,334
<i>Stop. Remember your training.</i>

623
00:49:54,336 --> 00:49:56,670
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

624
00:49:56,672 --> 00:50:00,141
<i>Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.</i>

625
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,410
She's on sublevel six.

626
00:50:03,412 --> 00:50:05,044
I'll get off on five...

627
00:50:05,046 --> 00:50:08,215
and take the stairs in case
she makes a run for it.

628
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:11,351
Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.

629
00:50:11,353 --> 00:50:14,323
Right. Like we did
in Havana.

630
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:26,266
<i>We're nearing
the jump point.</i>

631
00:50:26,268 --> 00:50:28,635
<i>Leave your beacon on
so I can find you.</i>

632
00:50:28,637 --> 00:50:31,204
We'll get to
the bottom of this, Vers.

633
00:50:31,206 --> 00:50:32,907
Together.

634
00:50:35,344 --> 00:50:36,612
Okay.

635
00:50:54,363 --> 00:50:55,963
Vers!

636
00:50:57,533 --> 00:50:58,933
Vers!

637
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:17,451
Fury's colluding
with the target.

638
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:18,785
Then why would he call us in?

639
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,353
All I know is
we take him in, too.

640
00:51:20,355 --> 00:51:21,488
Dead or alive.

641
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:22,789
Dead or alive?

642
00:51:37,606 --> 00:51:38,841
Go. Go, go!

643
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,522
Was it something I said?

644
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,574
Mmm-mmm.

645
00:52:32,261 --> 00:52:36,663
Now, you know, I don't really
need these to see...

646
00:52:36,665 --> 00:52:40,669
but they do
kinda complete the look.

647
00:52:41,403 --> 00:52:42,604
Don't you think?

648
00:53:00,255 --> 00:53:01,388
You called them in?

649
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,724
My bad.

650
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:18,905
Coulson,
do you have eyes on them?

651
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,642
They're not down here.

652
00:53:22,176 --> 00:53:23,211
Let's try up there.

653
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:33,753
- What?
- Your communicator.

654
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:35,822
You obviously
can't be trusted with it.

655
00:54:06,488 --> 00:54:08,321
Do you know
how to fly this thing?

656
00:54:08,323 --> 00:54:09,456
Uh, we'll see.

657
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:10,859
That's a yes or no question.

658
00:54:14,896 --> 00:54:15,897
Yes.

659
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:21,168
That's what I'm talking about!

660
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:49,631
We got a stowaway.

661
00:54:53,735 --> 00:54:54,803
Hang on, Goose.

662
00:54:59,975 --> 00:55:01,175
Goose.

663
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:05,347
No, Goose.

664
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:10,316
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?

665
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:11,985
Yes, that's right.

666
00:55:11,987 --> 00:55:14,354
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

667
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:15,655
You the good kitty,
that's right.

668
00:55:15,657 --> 00:55:16,792
See anyone you know?

669
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,326
Funny story.

670
00:55:20,328 --> 00:55:23,865
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.

671
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:25,965
That was six years ago.

672
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:28,368
So, you think
you're the pilot

673
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,703
that went down
with Dr. Lawson?

674
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:32,038
I'm saying the last person
to see them alive

675
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,373
could probably tell us.

676
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,974
- Maria Rambeau?
- Mm-hmm.

677
00:55:34,976 --> 00:55:37,677
So, how do we get
to Louisiana?

678
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:40,348
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.

679
00:55:41,783 --> 00:55:43,817
That agent...

680
00:55:43,819 --> 00:55:45,885
that stopped the Skrulls
from finding us?

681
00:55:45,887 --> 00:55:47,954
Coulson. The new guy.

682
00:55:47,956 --> 00:55:49,556
I guess
he doesn't hate me yet.

683
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:51,293
Yeah, well, give him time.

684
00:55:53,295 --> 00:55:54,961
I guess he had a feeling,
you know?

685
00:55:54,963 --> 00:55:57,397
Went with his gut
against orders.

686
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:58,832
That's a really
hard thing to do.

687
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:00,867
But it's what
keeps us human.

688
00:56:00,869 --> 00:56:03,503
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

689
00:56:03,505 --> 00:56:04,665
Oh, I can see that about you.

690
00:56:05,774 --> 00:56:09,943
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?

691
00:56:09,945 --> 00:56:11,377
I'm guessing that's not

692
00:56:11,379 --> 00:56:13,012
standard
Kree operating procedure.

693
00:56:13,014 --> 00:56:15,381
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

694
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:24,657
Ronan.

695
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:26,693
<i>The Accusers completed
their operation...</i>

696
00:56:26,695 --> 00:56:28,094
<i>but the greater mission
was a failure,</i>

697
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:29,496
<i>thanks to your team.</i>

698
00:56:29,498 --> 00:56:30,964
It was a trap

699
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:33,800
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

700
00:56:33,802 --> 00:56:34,934
<i>Give us their location.</i>

701
00:56:34,936 --> 00:56:36,803
<i>We'll take care
of the terrorist threat.</i>

702
00:56:36,805 --> 00:56:39,739
By bombing them
out of the galaxy?

703
00:56:39,741 --> 00:56:41,941
No, we'll handle this.

704
00:56:41,943 --> 00:56:44,043
<i>A cell of Skrulls anywhere</i>

705
00:56:44,045 --> 00:56:46,379
<i>is a threat
to Kree everywhere.</i>

706
00:56:46,381 --> 00:56:47,447
<i>Where are they?</i>

707
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:49,017
- They are...
- Lost.

708
00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:52,819
They are lost for now.

709
00:56:52,821 --> 00:56:54,554
But we will find them.

710
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:57,926
<i>Do so, or we will.</i>

711
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,566
Maintain the course
for C-53.

712
00:57:23,785 --> 00:57:25,954
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

713
00:57:28,089 --> 00:57:29,656
Auntie Carol?

714
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:31,593
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

715
00:57:32,761 --> 00:57:35,495
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

716
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:37,566
But we knew they were lying.

717
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:41,770
I'm not really
who you think I am.

718
00:57:50,946 --> 00:57:53,046
That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.

719
00:57:53,048 --> 00:57:56,182
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

720
00:57:56,184 --> 00:57:57,884
You are
absolutely right, young lady.

721
00:57:57,886 --> 00:57:59,619
There is no such thing.

722
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:00,987
'Cause if there were,

723
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:03,690
we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

724
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:04,759
You don't believe me?

725
00:58:12,767 --> 00:58:14,500
No way!

726
00:58:14,502 --> 00:58:16,569
That's so cool!

727
00:58:16,571 --> 00:58:18,004
Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea

728
00:58:18,006 --> 00:58:19,439
with those hands.

729
00:58:19,441 --> 00:58:20,540
Like what? Show us.

730
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:21,843
Maybe later.

731
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:24,577
I kept all your stuff.

732
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:26,713
I'll go get it.

733
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:28,383
You want to give her
a hand with that?

734
00:58:28,617 --> 00:58:29,684
Hmm?

735
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:46,635
You don't remember anything?

736
00:58:48,003 --> 00:58:51,439
I see flashes.

737
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:53,875
Little moments.

738
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:56,478
But I can't tell
what's real.

739
00:58:58,713 --> 00:59:02,582
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

740
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:04,819
maybe it'll all
make sense.

741
00:59:07,522 --> 00:59:11,225
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.

742
00:59:11,227 --> 00:59:13,660
Your usual move.

743
00:59:13,662 --> 00:59:16,596
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

744
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:19,132
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

745
00:59:19,134 --> 00:59:21,834
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

746
00:59:21,836 --> 00:59:23,136
at doing something
that mattered.

747
00:59:23,138 --> 00:59:26,039
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

748
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:26,973
and I wasn't about to argue,

749
00:59:26,975 --> 00:59:29,075
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

750
00:59:29,077 --> 00:59:31,511
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

751
00:59:31,513 --> 00:59:33,079
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

752
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:34,180
Since it violates
the predetermined

753
00:59:34,182 --> 00:59:35,282
rules of engagement.

754
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:36,749
I definitely
don't remember those.

755
00:59:36,751 --> 00:59:38,551
Hmm. Of course you don't.

756
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:48,761
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

757
00:59:48,763 --> 00:59:52,765
She said
she had lives to save.

758
00:59:52,767 --> 00:59:54,167
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

759
00:59:54,169 --> 00:59:55,302
but you said that...

760
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:59,105
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

761
00:59:59,107 --> 01:00:03,977
Yeah. Yep.
Big hero moment.

762
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:07,914
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

763
01:00:07,916 --> 01:00:11,718
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

764
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:16,258
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

765
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:19,792
I know this must be
hard for you.

766
01:00:19,794 --> 01:00:21,730
Oh, what?
This part right here?

767
01:00:22,564 --> 01:00:24,866
No. No. Mmm-mmm.

768
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:32,105
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

769
01:00:32,107 --> 01:00:33,639
in a mission so secret

770
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:35,710
they act like it never
even happened.

771
01:00:37,812 --> 01:00:41,248
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

772
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,151
too damn stubborn to die.

773
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:47,354
And now you come up in here
after six years...

774
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:49,589
with your supercharged
fire hands...

775
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:51,691
and you expect me
to call you...

776
01:00:51,693 --> 01:00:53,229
I don't even know what.
Vers?

777
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,998
Is that really
who you are now?

778
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:01,036
I don't know.

779
01:01:06,107 --> 01:01:07,742
Come look!

780
01:01:14,082 --> 01:01:15,882
This is me and you
on Halloween.

781
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:19,253
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

782
01:01:19,255 --> 01:01:20,987
Oh, this is you
when you were little.

783
01:01:20,989 --> 01:01:22,955
You didn't get along
with your parents...

784
01:01:22,957 --> 01:01:24,724
so Mom said
we became your real family.

785
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:26,293
This is us on Christmas.

786
01:01:26,295 --> 01:01:27,428
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

787
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,363
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

788
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:30,696
You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

789
01:01:30,698 --> 01:01:31,764
And this is right after
you graduated.

790
01:01:31,766 --> 01:01:32,999
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

791
01:01:33,001 --> 01:01:35,235
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

792
01:01:35,237 --> 01:01:36,636
And this is you with Mom

793
01:01:36,638 --> 01:01:37,904
right after a good day
of training.

794
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:39,306
These were
your three favorite guys.

795
01:01:41,643 --> 01:01:42,942
Oh, wait. I forgot.

796
01:01:42,944 --> 01:01:44,644
Your jacket.

797
01:01:44,646 --> 01:01:45,978
Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore

798
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,682
after I spilled
ketchup on it.

799
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:03,198
That was all
that survived the crash.

800
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,167
Or so we thought.

801
01:02:10,772 --> 01:02:12,805
Don't answer that.

802
01:02:12,807 --> 01:02:14,441
It's just my neighbor.

803
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:16,177
They can change into anyone.

804
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:22,949
Hi there.

805
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:23,952
What do you want?

806
01:02:25,321 --> 01:02:27,120
- Uh...
- Hey, Tom.

807
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:28,788
This is my friend, Carol.

808
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,091
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

809
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,460
Yowzers.

810
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:36,696
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

811
01:02:36,698 --> 01:02:39,399
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

812
01:02:39,401 --> 01:02:40,733
and I was just wondering...

813
01:02:40,735 --> 01:02:41,901
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

814
01:02:41,903 --> 01:02:43,102
to get a closer look-see?

815
01:02:43,104 --> 01:02:45,439
- A closer look-see?
- Yeah.

816
01:02:45,441 --> 01:02:48,743
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

817
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,076
Mmm.

818
01:02:50,078 --> 01:02:51,711
You're really working
overtime

819
01:02:51,713 --> 01:02:55,081
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

820
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:57,884
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

821
01:02:57,886 --> 01:02:59,486
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

822
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:01,390
- Uh...
- Okay.

823
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:07,727
You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

824
01:03:07,729 --> 01:03:08,961
You never know
when you're gonna need

825
01:03:08,963 --> 01:03:10,665
to borrow some sugar.

826
01:03:13,302 --> 01:03:15,502
Now, hang on a second.

827
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:19,206
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

828
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:22,177
making a mess
of your friend's house...

829
01:03:22,977 --> 01:03:24,378
It's a lovely home, miss.

830
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,680
Oh, my God!

831
01:03:26,114 --> 01:03:28,047
What the hell?

832
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:32,921
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

833
01:03:33,455 --> 01:03:36,088
Just don't kill me.

834
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,057
That would really complicate
the situation.

835
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:40,860
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

836
01:03:40,862 --> 01:03:42,229
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

837
01:03:42,231 --> 01:03:43,996
I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.

838
01:03:43,998 --> 01:03:47,767
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

839
01:03:47,769 --> 01:03:49,035
Without deception.

840
01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:50,239
And who is that out there?

841
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:53,773
Okay, that's a fair point...

842
01:03:53,775 --> 01:03:55,375
but I'm sure
that you understand

843
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:57,810
I had to take
some precautions.

844
01:03:57,812 --> 01:04:01,013
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

845
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:02,181
with your hands bound.

846
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:03,417
I just wanna talk.

847
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:04,484
Last time we talked,

848
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:05,918
I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

849
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,422
That was before I knew
who you were.

850
01:04:08,424 --> 01:04:11,726
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

851
01:04:12,794 --> 01:04:14,994
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

852
01:04:14,996 --> 01:04:18,030
of your voice
from a plane crash

853
01:04:18,032 --> 01:04:19,499
six years ago...

854
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:24,304
on a device I believe
you call a "black box."

855
01:04:24,306 --> 01:04:27,039
They told me it was
destroyed in the crash.

856
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,242
How'd you get it?

857
01:04:28,244 --> 01:04:29,409
She don't understand.

858
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:30,943
Young lady,
I have a special skill...

859
01:04:30,945 --> 01:04:32,379
that kind of allows me

860
01:04:32,381 --> 01:04:34,548
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

861
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,915
Call me
"young lady" again...

862
01:04:35,917 --> 01:04:37,217
I'm gonna put my foot
in a place

863
01:04:37,219 --> 01:04:38,753
it's not supposed to be.

864
01:04:40,822 --> 01:04:43,091
Am I supposed to guess
where that is?

865
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:44,625
Your ass.

866
01:04:44,627 --> 01:04:47,527
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

867
01:04:47,529 --> 01:04:49,496
But, look,
I just need your help

868
01:04:49,498 --> 01:04:50,997
decoding some coordinates.

869
01:04:50,999 --> 01:04:52,999
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

870
01:04:53,001 --> 01:04:56,137
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

871
01:04:58,906 --> 01:05:01,075
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

872
01:05:01,577 --> 01:05:02,842
Deal.

873
01:05:03,945 --> 01:05:05,978
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

874
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,314
How'd that get in here?

875
01:05:07,316 --> 01:05:08,417
Hmm?

876
01:05:09,917 --> 01:05:11,017
The cat?

877
01:05:11,019 --> 01:05:12,519
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

878
01:05:12,521 --> 01:05:13,821
That's not a cat.

879
01:05:14,856 --> 01:05:17,023
- That's a Flerken.
- A Flerken?

880
01:05:17,025 --> 01:05:18,527
Mom?

881
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:27,267
Monica.

882
01:05:27,269 --> 01:05:28,903
- Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!

883
01:05:56,565 --> 01:05:58,231
What's happening?

884
01:05:58,233 --> 01:05:59,535
It's loading.

885
01:06:03,572 --> 01:06:05,071
<i>Punch in the coordinates</i>

886
01:06:05,073 --> 01:06:09,509
<i>5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.</i>

887
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:11,611
<i>Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?</i>

888
01:06:11,613 --> 01:06:13,246
<i>My laboratory.</i>

889
01:06:13,248 --> 01:06:15,549
<i>Your laboratory?
What do you mean?</i>

890
01:06:15,551 --> 01:06:16,583
<i>Oh, no.</i>

891
01:06:16,585 --> 01:06:19,051
<i>Is that...
Wait, what is that?</i>

892
01:06:19,053 --> 01:06:20,520
<i>It's not showing up
on my radar.</i>

893
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:22,422
<i>Go, Carol. Fly!</i>

894
01:06:22,424 --> 01:06:24,957
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

895
01:06:24,959 --> 01:06:27,026
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

896
01:06:27,028 --> 01:06:28,029
Yes, ma'am.

897
01:06:34,135 --> 01:06:36,370
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

898
01:06:36,372 --> 01:06:37,972
I never should have
brought you along.

899
01:06:43,144 --> 01:06:44,145
Here come some G's.

900
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,367
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

901
01:07:16,712 --> 01:07:18,112
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

902
01:07:22,049 --> 01:07:23,151
Stay with me, Lawson!

903
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:42,769
<i>Carol, come in. Do you copy?</i>

904
01:07:42,771 --> 01:07:45,439
Yeah, I copy.
We hit ground.

905
01:07:45,441 --> 01:07:47,207
<i>Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?</i>

906
01:07:47,209 --> 01:07:49,344
Yeah! I copy.

907
01:07:52,146 --> 01:07:53,147
Doc?

908
01:07:54,148 --> 01:07:55,517
Your blood.

909
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:58,251
It's blue.

910
01:07:58,253 --> 01:08:01,390
Yeah, but, uh,
how's my hair?

911
01:08:02,758 --> 01:08:05,260
Help me out, will ya?

912
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:11,465
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

913
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:13,065
Lawson?

914
01:08:13,067 --> 01:08:15,569
You remember what I said about
our work here?

915
01:08:15,571 --> 01:08:16,672
What it's for?

916
01:08:17,706 --> 01:08:19,206
To end wars?

917
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:22,711
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

918
01:08:24,078 --> 01:08:25,447
Damn it!

919
01:08:26,147 --> 01:08:28,482
My name is not Lawson.

920
01:08:28,484 --> 01:08:31,585
My real name is Mar-Vell,

921
01:08:31,587 --> 01:08:34,521
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

922
01:08:35,691 --> 01:08:38,090
I would say
that you're delusional...

923
01:08:38,092 --> 01:08:39,626
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

924
01:08:39,628 --> 01:08:42,127
and your blood is blue.

925
01:08:42,129 --> 01:08:46,131
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

926
01:08:46,133 --> 01:08:48,067
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

927
01:08:48,069 --> 01:08:49,369
any more regrets.

928
01:08:49,371 --> 01:08:52,104
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

929
01:08:52,106 --> 01:08:53,707
You gotta save 'em without me.

930
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:54,708
Save who? How?

931
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:58,110
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

932
01:08:58,112 --> 01:08:59,348
What are you doing?

933
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:21,370
We have no interest
in hurting you.

934
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:22,936
No?

935
01:09:22,938 --> 01:09:25,807
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

936
01:09:27,442 --> 01:09:28,810
The energy core.

937
01:09:29,678 --> 01:09:31,211
Where is it?

938
01:09:31,213 --> 01:09:33,647
Pararescue's on the way.

939
01:09:33,649 --> 01:09:35,815
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

940
01:09:35,817 --> 01:09:38,652
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

941
01:09:38,654 --> 01:09:39,688
No, wait!

942
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:47,529
You mean that energy core?

943
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:53,268
No!

944
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:40,413
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

945
01:10:40,415 --> 01:10:41,416
Hold your fire.

946
01:10:51,426 --> 01:10:53,460
There's nothing left.

947
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:55,196
The core has been destroyed.

948
01:11:04,673 --> 01:11:06,675
She absorbed its power.

949
01:11:08,877 --> 01:11:10,712
She's coming with us.

950
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,901
He lied to me.

951
01:11:35,604 --> 01:11:37,704
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

952
01:11:37,706 --> 01:11:40,440
Now, you understand.

953
01:11:40,442 --> 01:11:42,976
What?
What do I understand now?

954
01:11:42,978 --> 01:11:45,011
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

955
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:46,314
He killed her...

956
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:48,915
'cause she found out
that she was

957
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:52,352
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

958
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:53,853
No.

959
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,289
Your people are terrorists.

960
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,824
They kill innocents.

961
01:11:57,826 --> 01:11:59,759
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

962
01:11:59,761 --> 01:12:03,463
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

963
01:12:03,465 --> 01:12:07,534
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

964
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:10,637
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

965
01:12:10,639 --> 01:12:12,772
and they destroyed
our planet.

966
01:12:12,774 --> 01:12:16,509
And the handful of us
that are left

967
01:12:16,511 --> 01:12:18,678
will be slaughtered next...

968
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,684
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

969
01:12:23,919 --> 01:12:25,518
The core that she found

970
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,287
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

971
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:29,055
capable of carrying us
to safety.

972
01:12:29,057 --> 01:12:33,228
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

973
01:12:34,629 --> 01:12:36,963
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

974
01:12:36,965 --> 01:12:38,498
wasn't to fight wars...

975
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,999
but to end them.

976
01:12:40,001 --> 01:12:45,640
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

977
01:12:46,608 --> 01:12:47,807
Well, I already destroyed it.

978
01:12:47,809 --> 01:12:49,576
No, you destroyed
the engine.

979
01:12:49,578 --> 01:12:52,712
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

980
01:12:52,714 --> 01:12:57,083
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

981
01:12:57,085 --> 01:12:58,720
we can find it.

982
01:13:00,555 --> 01:13:02,257
You'll use it
to destroy us.

983
01:13:04,493 --> 01:13:07,462
We just want a home.

984
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:16,970
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

985
01:13:16,972 --> 01:13:18,972
Can't you see it now?

986
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:20,475
You're not one of them.

987
01:13:23,512 --> 01:13:24,913
You don't know me.

988
01:13:26,414 --> 01:13:28,784
You have no idea
who I am.

989
01:13:30,886 --> 01:13:33,288
I don't even know
who I am!

990
01:13:34,523 --> 01:13:36,758
You are Carol Danvers.

991
01:13:37,959 --> 01:13:40,126
You are the woman
on that black box

992
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:42,764
risking her life
to do the right thing.

993
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:46,533
My best friend...

994
01:13:46,535 --> 01:13:49,536
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

995
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:51,604
when no one else did.

996
01:13:51,606 --> 01:13:56,810
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

997
01:13:56,812 --> 01:14:00,146
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

998
01:14:00,148 --> 01:14:03,418
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

999
01:14:04,019 --> 01:14:05,554
You hear me?

1000
01:14:06,888 --> 01:14:08,723
Do you hear me?

1001
01:14:15,931 --> 01:14:17,933
Come here. Come here, girl.

1002
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,001
I got you.

1003
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:27,607
<i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i>

1004
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:29,843
but you were our only lead.

1005
01:14:29,845 --> 01:14:32,111
We discovered
that your energy signature

1006
01:14:32,113 --> 01:14:34,916
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1007
01:14:35,784 --> 01:14:37,652
Now we know why.

1008
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:43,491
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1009
01:14:44,593 --> 01:14:46,426
I just need your help

1010
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:50,630
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1011
01:14:50,632 --> 01:14:53,800
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1012
01:14:53,802 --> 01:14:55,869
For orbital position
and velocity.

1013
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,704
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1014
01:14:57,706 --> 01:14:59,038
'cause it's not on Earth.

1015
01:14:59,040 --> 01:14:59,973
That was the location

1016
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:01,574
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1017
01:15:01,576 --> 01:15:02,942
If we track its course,

1018
01:15:02,944 --> 01:15:05,511
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1019
01:15:05,513 --> 01:15:07,082
It's just basic physics.

1020
01:15:09,651 --> 01:15:10,651
In orbit?

1021
01:15:12,587 --> 01:15:14,187
Was that so difficult
to figure out?

1022
01:15:14,189 --> 01:15:17,123
I mean, you're
my science guy, right?

1023
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:19,859
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1024
01:15:19,861 --> 01:15:22,695
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

1025
01:15:22,697 --> 01:15:24,564
Mmm. We're going
to space?

1026
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:25,632
In what?

1027
01:15:25,634 --> 01:15:27,533
A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.

1028
01:15:27,535 --> 01:15:29,769
I can handle
the modifications.

1029
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:31,506
Mmm. Your science guy.

1030
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:39,881
Well, I could use
a copilot.

1031
01:15:41,149 --> 01:15:43,816
No. No, I can't.

1032
01:15:43,818 --> 01:15:45,852
I can't leave Monica.

1033
01:15:45,854 --> 01:15:49,155
Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1034
01:15:49,157 --> 01:15:51,524
There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.

1035
01:15:51,526 --> 01:15:53,593
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...

1036
01:15:53,595 --> 01:15:54,629
and you used to do that.

1037
01:15:56,265 --> 01:15:58,232
Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere

1038
01:15:58,234 --> 01:15:59,899
in a craft not designed
for the journey...

1039
01:15:59,901 --> 01:16:01,734
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

1040
01:16:01,736 --> 01:16:02,835
with
a technologically-superior

1041
01:16:02,837 --> 01:16:03,838
foreign enemy.

1042
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:05,838
Correct?

1043
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,906
That's what I'm saying.

1044
01:16:06,908 --> 01:16:08,174
- You have to go!
- Monica!

1045
01:16:08,176 --> 01:16:09,575
You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission

1046
01:16:09,577 --> 01:16:10,810
in the history
of missions...

1047
01:16:10,812 --> 01:16:12,679
and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch

1048
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:13,882
and watch <i>Fresh Prince</i>
with me?

1049
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:15,782
What?

1050
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:16,983
I just think
you should consider...

1051
01:16:16,985 --> 01:16:20,222
what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.

1052
01:16:27,896 --> 01:16:29,296
What's going on around here?

1053
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:30,563
I know, I know.

1054
01:16:30,565 --> 01:16:31,967
I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

1055
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:39,306
Your mom's lucky.

1056
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:40,807
When they were
handing out kids,

1057
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:43,009
they gave her
the toughest one.

1058
01:16:43,011 --> 01:16:44,012
Lieutenant Trouble.

1059
01:16:45,013 --> 01:16:46,648
You remembered.

1060
01:16:48,016 --> 01:16:49,484
Is that mine?

1061
01:16:50,185 --> 01:16:52,319
No, no.

1062
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:55,188
You hang on to it
until I come back.

1063
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:57,890
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1064
01:16:57,892 --> 01:17:00,760
I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.

1065
01:17:00,762 --> 01:17:03,830
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

1066
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:05,700
with any sense of style...

1067
01:17:06,935 --> 01:17:08,003
Hmm?

1068
01:17:10,105 --> 01:17:11,139
Whoa.

1069
01:17:13,775 --> 01:17:14,943
No.

1070
01:17:17,213 --> 01:17:18,214
Uh-uh.

1071
01:17:19,781 --> 01:17:21,315
Definitely not.

1072
01:17:24,286 --> 01:17:26,721
Well, since we're
on the same team...

1073
01:17:37,799 --> 01:17:38,933
Hmm.

1074
01:17:40,236 --> 01:17:41,903
How do I look?

1075
01:17:45,341 --> 01:17:46,775
Fresh.

1076
01:18:06,694 --> 01:18:08,761
What took you so long?

1077
01:18:08,763 --> 01:18:11,731
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

1078
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:14,167
- PRY46-B...
- No, no codes.

1079
01:18:14,169 --> 01:18:15,937
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

1080
01:18:16,971 --> 01:18:19,306
Okay, then let's do this.

1081
01:18:19,308 --> 01:18:22,775
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

1082
01:18:22,777 --> 01:18:25,678
The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.

1083
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,920
But you would never
tell me who.

1084
01:18:28,284 --> 01:18:31,684
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

1085
01:18:31,686 --> 01:18:33,220
The transfusion.

1086
01:18:33,222 --> 01:18:35,422
Blue blood
running through my veins.

1087
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:36,624
Whose blood?

1088
01:18:39,228 --> 01:18:40,262
Hmm.

1089
01:18:47,735 --> 01:18:51,773
That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.

1090
01:18:56,312 --> 01:18:57,910
What have you done with her?

1091
01:18:57,912 --> 01:18:59,881
You're too late.

1092
01:19:16,365 --> 01:19:17,399
She knows?

1093
01:19:32,147 --> 01:19:35,715
Ronan, Skrulls have
infiltrated C-53.

1094
01:19:35,717 --> 01:19:36,849
Come at once.

1095
01:19:36,851 --> 01:19:39,085
<i>For the good of all Kree,
Commander...</i>

1096
01:19:39,087 --> 01:19:42,121
<i>the infestation
will be eradicated.</i>

1097
01:19:44,058 --> 01:19:45,927
Passing 500 and climbing.

1098
01:19:49,097 --> 01:19:52,366
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

1099
01:19:52,368 --> 01:19:55,835
Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

1100
01:19:55,837 --> 01:19:58,738
And as long as he continues
to freak you out...

1101
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,006
like that...

1102
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:02,409
yeah, I'm gonna keep
giving him

1103
01:20:02,411 --> 01:20:05,412
all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?

1104
01:20:05,414 --> 01:20:07,214
Can I ask you something?

1105
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:09,416
Do you just turn into
anything you want?

1106
01:20:09,418 --> 01:20:11,285
Ah, well,
I have to see it first.

1107
01:20:11,287 --> 01:20:12,919
Can you all do it?

1108
01:20:12,921 --> 01:20:14,854
Physiologically? Yeah.

1109
01:20:14,856 --> 01:20:17,123
But, uh, it takes practice...

1110
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:21,060
and, um, dare I say it,
talent to do it well.

1111
01:20:21,062 --> 01:20:23,763
- Can you turn into a cat?
- What's a cat?

1112
01:20:23,765 --> 01:20:25,299
What about a filing cabinet?

1113
01:20:25,301 --> 01:20:28,368
Why would I turn into
a filing cabinet?

1114
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:29,769
A Venus flytrap?

1115
01:20:29,771 --> 01:20:30,836
I'll give you
50 bucks right now

1116
01:20:30,838 --> 01:20:32,071
if you turn into
a Venus flytrap.

1117
01:20:32,073 --> 01:20:33,873
Switching engines

1118
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:36,110
from Scramjet to Fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

1119
01:20:45,254 --> 01:20:46,185
Hey.

1120
01:20:46,187 --> 01:20:49,055
Is this normal,
like, space turbulence?

1121
01:20:49,057 --> 01:20:50,058
Pretty much.

1122
01:21:23,858 --> 01:21:25,860
Locking in
on coordinate grid.

1123
01:21:26,328 --> 01:21:27,496
Where is it?

1124
01:21:31,099 --> 01:21:34,033
It's here.
It's gotta be here.

1125
01:21:34,035 --> 01:21:39,241
Well, is it in front of all
that nothing, or behind it?

1126
01:21:44,879 --> 01:21:46,946
<i>Decloaking activated.</i>

1127
01:22:49,944 --> 01:22:51,645
Is that it? The core?

1128
01:22:51,647 --> 01:22:54,082
In her notes she called it
the Tesseract.

1129
01:23:00,188 --> 01:23:01,256
Whoa.

1130
01:23:02,924 --> 01:23:05,093
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

1131
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,139
We're not alone.

1132
01:23:43,197 --> 01:23:44,466
Talos!

1133
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:57,312
He didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

1134
01:24:19,768 --> 01:24:21,135
It's okay.

1135
01:24:26,107 --> 01:24:27,741
We didn't know what to do.

1136
01:24:27,743 --> 01:24:31,311
Mar-Vell warned us not to send
a signal for any reason...

1137
01:24:31,313 --> 01:24:33,078
or the Kree would find us.

1138
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,183
You did the right thing.

1139
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:46,493
It's okay, it's okay.

1140
01:24:46,495 --> 01:24:48,564
She's all right.
She's a friend.

1141
01:24:50,599 --> 01:24:52,532
I am not gonna hurt you.

1142
01:24:52,534 --> 01:24:54,436
She led me to you.

1143
01:24:55,237 --> 01:24:56,638
I'm so sorry.

1144
01:24:58,407 --> 01:24:59,739
I didn't know.

1145
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:00,975
Carol.

1146
01:25:01,643 --> 01:25:04,478
This is war.

1147
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,982
My hands are
filthy from it, too.

1148
01:25:08,617 --> 01:25:10,750
But we're here now.

1149
01:25:10,752 --> 01:25:13,988
You found my family.

1150
01:25:16,825 --> 01:25:18,792
This is just the beginning.

1151
01:25:18,794 --> 01:25:21,697
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

1152
01:25:22,798 --> 01:25:25,567
scattered throughout
the galaxy.

1153
01:25:43,385 --> 01:25:45,685
If I played the same pinball
machine for six years...

1154
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:47,687
I'd have
some high scores, too.

1155
01:25:50,325 --> 01:25:52,626
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1156
01:25:52,628 --> 01:25:53,729
Uh-uh.

1157
01:26:05,807 --> 01:26:08,107
What did you do
to your uniform?

1158
01:26:08,109 --> 01:26:10,243
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

1159
01:26:10,245 --> 01:26:12,111
The Supreme Intelligence
will set her straight.

1160
01:26:12,113 --> 01:26:13,580
You can see
they're not soldiers.

1161
01:26:13,582 --> 01:26:16,148
Let 'em go.
You can have me.

1162
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:17,684
And the core?

1163
01:26:17,686 --> 01:26:19,286
You lied to me.

1164
01:26:19,288 --> 01:26:23,290
I made you
the best version of yourself.

1165
01:26:26,595 --> 01:26:29,596
What's given
can be taken away.

1166
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:44,511
Back here! Move, move!

1167
01:26:44,513 --> 01:26:47,081
Get over here. Get down!

1168
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:50,252
Let's go! Go, move!

1169
01:27:29,591 --> 01:27:31,324
There she is.

1170
01:27:31,326 --> 01:27:34,763
Seems like your time on C-53
jogged the old memory.

1171
01:27:35,664 --> 01:27:37,530
This jacket.

1172
01:27:37,532 --> 01:27:39,534
It's killer,
by the way.

1173
01:27:40,936 --> 01:27:42,535
Oh.

1174
01:27:42,537 --> 01:27:44,771
The music.
It's a nice touch.

1175
01:27:44,773 --> 01:27:46,606
Let me out.

1176
01:27:46,608 --> 01:27:48,541
No can do.

1177
01:27:48,543 --> 01:27:52,445
If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.

1178
01:27:52,447 --> 01:27:54,381
With what exactly?

1179
01:27:54,383 --> 01:27:55,782
Your power comes from us.

1180
01:27:55,784 --> 01:27:57,717
You didn't give me
these powers.

1181
01:27:57,719 --> 01:27:58,885
The blast did.

1182
01:27:58,887 --> 01:28:00,353
And yet, you've never had
the strength

1183
01:28:00,355 --> 01:28:01,456
to control them
on your own.

1184
01:28:12,801 --> 01:28:14,567
<i>Species: Flerken.</i>

1185
01:28:14,569 --> 01:28:16,569
<i>Threat: high.</i>

1186
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:23,412
It's a cat,
not Hannibal Lecter.

1187
01:28:26,948 --> 01:28:28,648
<i>Species: human male.</i>

1188
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:30,852
<i>Threat: low to none.</i>

1189
01:28:31,987 --> 01:28:33,553
That thing's
clearly busted.

1190
01:28:33,555 --> 01:28:35,657
Load the Flerken
onto the <i>Helion.</i>

1191
01:28:36,491 --> 01:28:38,460
Eject the others into space.

1192
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:43,398
You did good, Ace.

1193
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:46,032
Thanks to you...

1194
01:28:46,034 --> 01:28:48,268
those insidious shapeshifters

1195
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:49,836
will threaten
our borders no more.

1196
01:28:49,838 --> 01:28:52,372
I used to believe
your lies...

1197
01:28:52,374 --> 01:28:55,008
but the Skrulls are
just fighting for a home.

1198
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:56,710
You're talking
about destroying them

1199
01:28:56,712 --> 01:28:58,545
because they won't submit
to your rule.

1200
01:28:58,547 --> 01:28:59,746
And neither will I.

1201
01:28:59,748 --> 01:29:03,049
We found you.
We embraced you as our own.

1202
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:04,718
You stole me.

1203
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,554
From my home,
my family, my friends.

1204
01:29:15,564 --> 01:29:17,466
It's cute how hard you try.

1205
01:29:19,568 --> 01:29:21,303
But remember...

1206
01:29:22,571 --> 01:29:23,870
without us...

1207
01:29:23,872 --> 01:29:24,940
<i>Give it up, Carol.</i>

1208
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,007
<i>Stay down!</i>

1209
01:29:28,009 --> 01:29:29,676
...you're weak.

1210
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:31,611
<i>You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!</i>

1211
01:29:31,613 --> 01:29:33,012
You're flawed.

1212
01:29:33,014 --> 01:29:34,854
<i>Are you trying
to kill yourself?</i>

1213
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:36,416
Helpless.

1214
01:29:36,418 --> 01:29:37,484
<i>You're too emotional
and so weak.</i>

1215
01:29:37,486 --> 01:29:39,886
<i>You don't belong out here!</i>

1216
01:29:39,888 --> 01:29:41,588
We saved you.

1217
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:43,056
<i>- Control it.
- I told you,</i>

1218
01:29:43,058 --> 01:29:44,124
<i>- Carol.
- They'll never</i>

1219
01:29:44,126 --> 01:29:45,391
<i>- let you fly.
- This ain't</i>

1220
01:29:45,393 --> 01:29:46,459
<i>- a game for little girls.
- You kiss like a horse.</i>

1221
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:48,072
<i>You won't last
a week, Danvers.</i>

1222
01:29:50,699 --> 01:29:53,769
Without us,
you're only human.

1223
01:29:55,337 --> 01:29:56,538
You're right.

1224
01:29:57,739 --> 01:29:59,841
I'm only human.

1225
01:30:33,809 --> 01:30:37,410
On Hala,
you were reborn...

1226
01:30:37,412 --> 01:30:38,713
Vers.

1227
01:30:43,718 --> 01:30:46,655
My name is Carol.

1228
01:31:01,469 --> 01:31:02,938
She's trying to break out.

1229
01:31:47,182 --> 01:31:50,652
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

1230
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:53,152
But what happens when...

1231
01:31:56,191 --> 01:31:58,426
I'm finally set free?

1232
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:41,601
You know you're glowing,
right?

1233
01:32:41,603 --> 01:32:42,723
I'll explain it later.

1234
01:32:45,173 --> 01:32:46,639
Take the Tesseract.

1235
01:32:46,641 --> 01:32:47,874
Leave the lunchbox.

1236
01:32:47,876 --> 01:32:49,609
- Me?
- Yes.

1237
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:51,010
I'm not touching that thing.

1238
01:32:51,012 --> 01:32:52,412
You want me to
get you an oven mitt?

1239
01:32:57,953 --> 01:32:59,120
Whoa!

1240
01:33:05,827 --> 01:33:08,561
Get the Skrulls
on the Quadjet and go.

1241
01:33:08,563 --> 01:33:11,231
Take the Flerken with you.

1242
01:33:11,233 --> 01:33:13,001
- What about you?
- I'll buy you some time!

1243
01:33:14,936 --> 01:33:16,805
I'm picking you up now.

1244
01:33:19,908 --> 01:33:22,510
I'm trusting you
not to eat me.

1245
01:33:27,682 --> 01:33:28,683
Oh, hey, guys.

1246
01:33:32,587 --> 01:33:34,122
Arm wrestle
for the Tesseract?

1247
01:33:37,226 --> 01:33:39,892
I used to find you amusing.

1248
01:33:39,894 --> 01:33:40,895
Let's put an end to this.

1249
01:34:16,265 --> 01:34:17,265
Okay.

1250
01:34:17,799 --> 01:34:19,032
Good kitty.

1251
01:35:05,381 --> 01:35:07,182
You knew all along.

1252
01:35:08,284 --> 01:35:09,715
Is that why
we never hung out?

1253
01:35:09,717 --> 01:35:10,819
No, I just never
liked you.

1254
01:35:18,026 --> 01:35:19,027
Incoming!

1255
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:28,636
Hey, in a hurry?

1256
01:35:30,839 --> 01:35:32,839
Don't make me do this.

1257
01:35:32,841 --> 01:35:33,842
Okay.

1258
01:35:49,724 --> 01:35:50,725
Come on, do your thing!

1259
01:35:51,893 --> 01:35:52,961
Come on!

1260
01:35:55,231 --> 01:35:56,829
Come on!

1261
01:35:59,868 --> 01:36:01,235
Damn it, Goose.

1262
01:36:01,237 --> 01:36:02,338
Pick a side.

1263
01:36:06,708 --> 01:36:08,741
Take them
to the hangar, too.

1264
01:36:08,743 --> 01:36:10,444
We'll blast them all
into space.

1265
01:36:12,448 --> 01:36:13,648
Play it cool.

1266
01:36:15,049 --> 01:36:16,318
Just like Havana.

1267
01:36:18,153 --> 01:36:20,387
Do you have the thing?

1268
01:36:20,389 --> 01:36:22,023
Flerken kitty ate it.

1269
01:36:35,337 --> 01:36:36,969
Come on, move!

1270
01:36:36,971 --> 01:36:38,106
Move!

1271
01:36:38,773 --> 01:36:40,008
Follow my lead.

1272
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:45,052
Cover her eyes.

1273
01:36:53,422 --> 01:36:55,188
Onto the ship!

1274
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:56,958
Let's go! Let's go!

1275
01:37:19,847 --> 01:37:22,148
Nice diversion.

1276
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:23,952
I could have swore
I put it in there.

1277
01:38:20,975 --> 01:38:23,175
Minn-Erva, take them down
in the drop ship.

1278
01:38:23,177 --> 01:38:24,246
On it.

1279
01:38:28,983 --> 01:38:30,084
You all right, friend?

1280
01:38:31,152 --> 01:38:33,087
Never better.

1281
01:38:37,925 --> 01:38:39,561
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1282
01:40:19,495 --> 01:40:21,195
Yes! Boom!

1283
01:40:37,212 --> 01:40:38,380
Whoo!

1284
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:43,117
What the hell was that?

1285
01:41:06,442 --> 01:41:08,544
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1286
01:42:00,762 --> 01:42:02,429
That's impossible.

1287
01:42:02,431 --> 01:42:04,798
C-53 doesn't have
a defense system

1288
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,503
advanced enough
to destroy our warheads.

1289
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:11,473
That's not
their defense system, Ronan.

1290
01:42:15,844 --> 01:42:17,178
Take her down.

1291
01:42:37,131 --> 01:42:38,165
Whoo!

1292
01:43:27,649 --> 01:43:29,585
Return to the jump point.

1293
01:43:30,619 --> 01:43:32,721
We'll be back
for the weapon.

1294
01:43:34,356 --> 01:43:35,524
The core?

1295
01:43:37,392 --> 01:43:38,627
The woman.

1296
01:44:26,742 --> 01:44:28,310
I'm so proud of you.

1297
01:44:30,312 --> 01:44:31,678
You've come a long way

1298
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:34,280
since I found you
that day by the lake.

1299
01:44:34,282 --> 01:44:36,449
But can you keep
your emotions in check

1300
01:44:36,451 --> 01:44:38,752
long enough to take me on?

1301
01:44:38,754 --> 01:44:41,490
Or will they get the
better of you as always?

1302
01:44:42,924 --> 01:44:44,791
I always told you...

1303
01:44:44,793 --> 01:44:46,292
you'll be ready

1304
01:44:46,294 --> 01:44:48,695
the day you can knock
me down as yourself.

1305
01:44:48,697 --> 01:44:50,397
This is that moment.

1306
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:52,932
This is that moment, Vers!

1307
01:44:52,934 --> 01:44:54,334
Turn off the light show...

1308
01:44:54,336 --> 01:44:57,606
and prove to me
you can beat me without...

1309
01:45:13,021 --> 01:45:15,223
I have nothing
to prove to you.

1310
01:45:30,906 --> 01:45:33,273
<i>Destination: Hala.</i>

1311
01:45:33,275 --> 01:45:34,908
I can't go back empty-handed.

1312
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:36,843
You won't be empty-handed.

1313
01:45:36,845 --> 01:45:39,412
I'm sending you
with a message.

1314
01:45:39,414 --> 01:45:42,682
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1315
01:45:42,684 --> 01:45:45,487
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1316
01:45:47,389 --> 01:45:48,690
You can't do this.

1317
01:46:07,609 --> 01:46:11,344
That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? Huh?

1318
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:13,780
Those bad guys
still in there somewhere?

1319
01:46:13,782 --> 01:46:14,914
Ow!

1320
01:46:14,916 --> 01:46:16,449
Mother Flerken!

1321
01:46:16,451 --> 01:46:17,884
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1322
01:46:17,886 --> 01:46:19,521
It's just a scratch.

1323
01:46:19,821 --> 01:46:21,256
No.

1324
01:46:28,697 --> 01:46:30,630
I can't believe

1325
01:46:30,632 --> 01:46:32,031
you got in the raddest
dogfight ever...

1326
01:46:32,033 --> 01:46:33,666
and I missed it.

1327
01:46:33,668 --> 01:46:35,468
I'd say you arrived
just in time.

1328
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:37,637
Some nifty flying
you did out there.

1329
01:46:37,639 --> 01:46:39,773
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.

1330
01:46:39,775 --> 01:46:41,674
I'll consider it...

1331
01:46:41,676 --> 01:46:44,811
as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.

1332
01:46:44,813 --> 01:46:46,012
How's your eye?

1333
01:46:46,014 --> 01:46:48,448
Hmm. Getting better
every second.

1334
01:46:48,450 --> 01:46:49,749
Just so I'm clear...

1335
01:46:49,751 --> 01:46:51,384
you were Soh-Larr...

1336
01:46:51,386 --> 01:46:53,820
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
- Keller.

1337
01:46:53,822 --> 01:46:56,422
He tied my boss up,
stole his identity.

1338
01:46:56,424 --> 01:46:59,425
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1339
01:46:59,427 --> 01:47:00,760
It is a little like stealing.

1340
01:47:00,762 --> 01:47:02,495
Whose side are you on here?

1341
01:47:02,497 --> 01:47:03,997
You're good to go here
until you recover...

1342
01:47:03,999 --> 01:47:07,367
but you and your family
are gonna need a new look.

1343
01:47:07,369 --> 01:47:08,968
I could go back
to being your boss.

1344
01:47:08,970 --> 01:47:10,069
Uh, please don't.

1345
01:47:10,071 --> 01:47:13,106
Come on. I loved sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

1346
01:47:13,108 --> 01:47:15,742
No way.
You guys have the best eyes.

1347
01:47:15,744 --> 01:47:17,777
Don't ever change
your eyes.

1348
01:47:17,779 --> 01:47:19,412
She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.

1349
01:47:19,414 --> 01:47:21,080
I was trying
not to panic...

1350
01:47:21,082 --> 01:47:22,651
I'll help you find a home.

1351
01:47:23,718 --> 01:47:24,878
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1352
01:47:26,888 --> 01:47:29,389
They can stay here
with us.

1353
01:47:29,391 --> 01:47:30,957
Can't they, Mom?

1354
01:47:30,959 --> 01:47:33,593
They won't
be safe here, baby.

1355
01:47:33,595 --> 01:47:35,161
Auntie Carol's right.

1356
01:47:35,163 --> 01:47:36,364
They need their own home.

1357
01:47:37,532 --> 01:47:39,732
I'll be back
before you know it.

1358
01:47:39,734 --> 01:47:43,102
Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

1359
01:47:43,104 --> 01:47:46,072
Ah, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

1360
01:47:46,074 --> 01:47:47,640
Or maybe I'll build
a spaceship.

1361
01:47:47,642 --> 01:47:49,444
- You don't know.
- He doesn't.

1362
01:47:59,054 --> 01:48:01,590
Keep the Tesseract
on Earth.

1363
01:48:02,157 --> 01:48:03,489
Hidden.

1364
01:48:03,491 --> 01:48:05,527
You sure that's what
Marvel would want?

1365
01:48:06,061 --> 01:48:07,460
Mar-Vell.

1366
01:48:07,462 --> 01:48:08,828
That's what I said.

1367
01:48:08,830 --> 01:48:11,431
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1368
01:48:11,433 --> 01:48:12,832
Mar-Vell.

1369
01:48:12,834 --> 01:48:13,967
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1370
01:48:13,969 --> 01:48:15,403
You know,
like the Marvelettes.

1371
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:30,116
Not ringing any bells?

1372
01:48:30,118 --> 01:48:32,153
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

1373
01:48:47,636 --> 01:48:49,736
I upgraded it.

1374
01:48:49,738 --> 01:48:52,107
Range should be a couple
galaxies, at least.

1375
01:48:54,809 --> 01:48:57,110
What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?

1376
01:48:57,112 --> 01:49:00,749
For emergencies only, okay?

1377
01:49:05,254 --> 01:49:08,121
Well...

1378
01:49:08,123 --> 01:49:10,657
if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...

1379
01:49:10,659 --> 01:49:12,694
be sure to give
a brother a shout.

1380
01:49:14,863 --> 01:49:16,731
Oh!

1381
01:49:29,511 --> 01:49:31,546
We got
the ketchup stain off.

1382
01:49:36,885 --> 01:49:38,720
Thanks,
Lieutenant Trouble.

1383
01:49:40,722 --> 01:49:41,890
Hmm.

1384
01:49:47,963 --> 01:49:50,697
It's hard for me
to say goodbye, too.

1385
01:50:04,179 --> 01:50:05,513
Go on.

1386
01:51:12,381 --> 01:51:15,183
Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

1387
01:51:20,121 --> 01:51:21,290
So, is it true?

1388
01:51:22,358 --> 01:51:23,890
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1389
01:51:23,892 --> 01:51:27,160
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1390
01:51:27,162 --> 01:51:31,097
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

1391
01:51:31,099 --> 01:51:32,167
Understood.

1392
01:51:33,802 --> 01:51:34,767
I'm sorry to report

1393
01:51:34,769 --> 01:51:36,002
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.

1394
01:51:36,004 --> 01:51:38,238
I'm sure it'll turn up
somewhere.

1395
01:51:39,874 --> 01:51:41,774
I'll let you know
when it does.

1396
01:51:41,776 --> 01:51:43,078
Then what?

1397
01:51:43,711 --> 01:51:45,011
Sir?

1398
01:51:45,013 --> 01:51:45,978
We have no idea

1399
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:49,349
what other intergalactic
threats are out there.

1400
01:51:49,351 --> 01:51:51,418
And our one-woman
security force

1401
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:52,952
had a prior commitment...

1402
01:51:52,954 --> 01:51:54,756
on the other side
of the universe.

1403
01:51:57,426 --> 01:51:59,661
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone
can't protect us.

1404
01:52:01,263 --> 01:52:03,129
We need to find more.

1405
01:52:03,131 --> 01:52:04,264
More weapons?

1406
01:52:04,266 --> 01:52:06,165
More heroes.

1407
01:52:06,167 --> 01:52:07,867
You think you can find
others like her?

1408
01:52:07,869 --> 01:52:10,872
Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.

1409
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:13,174
Get some rest, sir.

1410
01:52:14,243 --> 01:52:16,111
You got
a big decision to make.

1411
01:55:15,257 --> 01:55:16,991
This is a nightmare.

1412
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,928
I've had better nightmares.

1413
01:55:23,064 --> 01:55:24,098
Hey.

1414
01:55:25,166 --> 01:55:27,301
So, that thing just stopped

1415
01:55:27,303 --> 01:55:29,070
doing whatever the hell
it was doing.

1416
01:55:31,005 --> 01:55:33,573
What do we got?

1417
01:55:33,575 --> 01:55:36,175
Whatever signal it was
sending finally crapped out.

1418
01:55:36,177 --> 01:55:37,277
I thought
we bypassed the battery.

1419
01:55:37,279 --> 01:55:38,412
We did.

1420
01:55:38,414 --> 01:55:42,215
It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.

1421
01:55:42,217 --> 01:55:44,150
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

1422
01:55:44,152 --> 01:55:45,619
We don't even know
what this is.

1423
01:55:45,621 --> 01:55:48,355
Fury did.
Just do it, please.

1424
01:55:48,357 --> 01:55:51,090
You tell me
the second you get a signal.

1425
01:55:51,092 --> 01:55:53,495
I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.

1426
01:55:56,432 --> 01:55:57,965
Where's Fury?

1427
