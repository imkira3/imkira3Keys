1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,159
<i>Look alive.</i>

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,839
<i>Contact appears to be heading
315 miles.</i>

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,287
<i>Speed 430, Angels.
Approximately 2, 000.</i>

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,959
What's taking this guy so long?

6
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,879
Is he really as good as they say he is?

7
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,087
No. Better.

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,439
Oh. yeah!

9
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,602
Whoa! Who was that?

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,959
Why, hello, ladies.
Are you ready to lose?

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,199
Last one to the water tower
buys a round of fuel.

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,519
Tell you what,
I'll give you guys a head start.

13
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,719
- You're going to need it.
- Later, loser.

14
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,486
One one-thousand, two one...
Oh, that's enough.

15
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,205
See ya, suckers!

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,527
Eat my...

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,450
- Dusty!
- Oh! Aw...

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,719
Pay attention.
You're daydreaming again.

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,079
Me? No, no, no! No.

20
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,199
Okay, yes.

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,202
But, you know, come on, Leadbottom.

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,239
Really? How hard is this?

23
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,561
Fly straight, turn around.
Fly straight, turn around.

24
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,042
Are you disrespecting
the sweet science of aerial application?

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,043
Look, I am more than just a crop duster.

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,208
Don't go flap-jawing

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,919
about that Flings Around the Planet
air racing nonsense again.

28
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,163
Excuse me, it is called
the Wings Around the Globe Rally.

29
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,651
For the love of Peterbilt!

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,127
And it's not nonsense.
I've got a tight turn radius

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,639
and a high power-to-weight ratio.

32
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,721
- You know what else you got?
- What?

33
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,121
A screw loose!

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,242
I mean, why would you
want to give up crop-dusting?

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,203
Blue skies, no air traffic,
and that tangy scent of Vita-minamulch.

36
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,560
Mmm.

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,768
Just like Momma used to spray.

38
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,119
Delicious.

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,930
They say the sense of smell
is the first thing to go.

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,082
- You smell it?
- Quitting time!

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,161
A crop duster wanting to be a racer.

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,450
If you ask me, more racers
should want to be crop dusters.

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,843
<i>I got some minamulch, yeah!
Minamulch</i>

44
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,405
Yuck. Nowadays, they got soybean fuel,
switchgrass fuel, algae fuel. Come on!

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,479
- Oh, healthy! No tank you.
- Tell me about it.

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,679
- What's next, pistachio propane?
- What, are you nuts?

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,439
For my money, there's nothing like
good old-fashioned corn fuel.

48
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,522
- Oh, yeah, you betcha.
- I even made up a slogan.

49
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,960
Oh, slogans are good.

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,806
"Corn. it gives you gas."

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,048
Catchy. I like that.

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,521
Me, too. There you go, Sparky,
you're all set.

53
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,330
- Catch you later, Chug.
- Sure thing.

54
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,847
<i>This is
Dusty Crophopper to Chug. Over.</i>

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,759
Uh, Chug isn't here.
Come on, use the new call sign.

56
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,799
<i>Right, right, right.</i>

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,719
<i>This is, uh, Strut Jetstream
calling Turbo Coach Truck-zilla.</i>

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,724
<i>- Ready for practice?</i>
- You betcha, Strut.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,321
Ha-ha! Whoo!

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,359
Young punk.

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,199
All right, buddy,
I got you in sight.

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,168
Now let's start with
some corn-row sprints.

63
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,049
<i>Drop and give me 20!</i>

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,844
<i>Come on, buddy, keep it going!</i>

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,490
<i>- Ooh, nice turn.</i>
- What else you got?

66
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,449
Okay. Now, let's try
some treeline moguls.

67
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,840
Yeah!

68
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,442
<i>All the way up and down.</i>

69
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,679
<i>Don't be dogging it.</i>

70
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,839
<i>- That's how you do it.</i>
- Ooh, yeah!

71
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,444
<i>- Looking good!</i>
- Uh-huh.

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,446
Okay, adjust your angle of bank
with your alien irons!

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,804
- You mean "ailerons"?
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

74
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,690
Oh, great.

75
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,919
Oil lines and oil cooler
check out.

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,921
Mmm-hmm.

77
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,651
- AN-8 fittings look fine.
- Nice.

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,370
Wait a minute.

79
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,046
You've worn out your main oil-seal.

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,719
Huh. Really?

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,879
That kind of damage comes from
extremely high speeds.

82
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,319
Hey!

83
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,239
Pushing the engine to the red line
for prolonged periods of time.

84
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,559
- That would be unwise.
- But that's not you.

85
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,769
You're a crop duster
and all you do is just dust crops

86
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,969
- at very low speeds.
- Yep, low and slow.

87
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,851
Unless you've been racing again!

88
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,971
No! What, me? No.

89
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,328
Oh, man, Duster, you were in the zone,

90
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,249
where a Saturn rocket
couldn't catch you!

91
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,479
Ballistic!

92
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,562
We're talking light speed.
Light speed, here!

93
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,845
You're going to tear it up
at the qualifier this weekend.

94
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,404
Yea... Oh, Shelby.

95
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,768
Um... I don't know.

96
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,487
Dusty, you're not built to race.

97
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,483
You're built to dust crops.

98
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,079
Do you know what will happen
if you push it too far?

99
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,004
Wing flutter,
metal fatigue, turbine failure.

100
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,771
Turbine failure?
Oh, no, I'm going down!

101
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,285
Why didn't I listen to Dottie?

102
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,930
Yeah, why don't you listen to Dottie?

103
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,959
She's the smartest mechanic
in the world!

104
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,041
- Oh, my gosh!
- What?

105
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,730
- The orphanage!
- No.

106
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,001
- Not the orphanage!
- Kids, out of the way!

107
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,360
Kaboom!

108
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,486
The kids!

109
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,359
Wow! That was vivid and specific.

110
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,648
And exactly why I need you
to come with us to the qualifier.

111
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,801
You're unbelievable.

112
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,167
Oh. Did you hear that? I'm unbelievable.

113
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,482
The orphans!

114
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,684
<i>Tune in, in two weeks for the start of
the Wings Around the Globe.</i>

115
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,359
You know, I think we've got
a really good shot at this, buddy.

116
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,966
Oh, yeah! Especially
if I finish this book by then.

117
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,651
Oh! I love this show!

118
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,691
<i>The 10 best
air crashes of all time!</i>

119
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,159
- Whoa! Oh.
- Not good.

120
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,321
How does that happen?

121
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,039
That is not going to buff out.

122
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,489
You know, this might not cover
everything you could run into out there.

123
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,479
- What are you getting at?
- I don't know.

124
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,159
I'm just wondering if maybe
we need, uh, some help.

125
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,359
Help? From who?

126
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,283
Oh, well, like the Skipper.

127
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,281
That old Corsair
down at the end of the runway?

128
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,599
- Sure, he's a war hero.
- He's an old crankshaft.

129
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,170
My buddy, Sparky, says the Skipper

130
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,039
was a legendary
flight instructor in the navy.

131
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,839
That's right. He knows stuff.

132
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,171
He's been grounded for decades.

133
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,039
Why would I want to be coached
by a plane who doesn't even fly?

134
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,759
At least he's a plane.

135
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,519
<i>The number one crash
of all time...</i>

136
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,679
Oh, man!

137
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,727
<i>I'm okay.</i>

138
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,921
<i>Ooh! That's got to hurt.</i>

139
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,726
They say
he shot down 50 planes.

140
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,168
I heard stories about his squadron,
the Jolly Wrenches.

141
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,481
Mmm-hmm.

142
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,047
They were the roughest, toughest,
meanest flyers in the navy.

143
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,931
Ruthless killers who showed no mercy.

144
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,168
- Uh, wait, so...
- No mercy!

145
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,770
They would shoot you
as soon as look at you.

146
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,440
I hope you're right about this.

147
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,401
Chug!

148
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,926
I'll wait here.

149
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,571
Uh...

150
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,927
Hey, there, Skipper.

151
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,165
Say, I'm trying out for
the Wings Around the Globe Rally.

152
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,483
And I know you can't fly anymore,

153
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,766
but, you know, they say,
"Those who can't do, teach."

154
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,968
So...

155
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,319
Okay, what I mean to say is,
you're not a truck.

156
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,802
So, I was wondering
if you would train me?

157
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,331
Go on, he's warming up to you.

158
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,406
So, I heard you shot down 50 planes.

159
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,364
You looking to be number 51?

160
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,443
Uh... No.

161
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,801
No, no, no! Wait, wait.

162
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,039
I just... I figured,
with my guts and your glory...

163
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,487
Your guts would be a grease spot
on a runway somewhere.

164
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,959
Go home. You're in over your head, kid.

165
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,849
Look, you flew all those...

166
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,961
Let's try the back door.

167
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,008
- Hello, Lincoln!
- Hey, Dusty!

168
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,639
I don't know how
you talked me into coming to this.

169
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,799
Now, come on, Dottie.

170
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,719
Wow! I don't believe it. A Red Tail P-51!

171
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,802
Oh, man! A Sea Fury!

172
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,482
Check it out!

173
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,721
Wow!

174
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,041
<i>Ladies and gentleplanes.</i>

175
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,208
<i>May we have your attention, please?</i>

176
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,840
<i>Kindly direct your windscreens
to the heavens above</i>

177
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,323
<i>and give a warm welcome
to our special guest.</i>

178
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,599
<i>The Prince of Propellers.</i>

179
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,523
<i>When he's speeding, he's leading.</i>

180
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,165
Get my good side, fellas.

181
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,365
<i>When he's grinning, he's winning.</i>

182
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,921
<i>The one and only</i>

183
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,526
Ripslinger!

184
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,688
You're caught in the riptide!

185
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,719
Thanks for coming out.

186
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,119
Who wants a picture?
All right, one at a time.

187
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,090
Well, with all that self-promotion,
at least he's modest.

188
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,368
Dottie, that's Ripslinger.

189
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,444
He's captain of Team RPX.
They call him...

190
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,443
The Green Tornado.

191
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,251
Oh, he's so good, he's pre-qualified.

192
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,204
Oh. And those two, Ned and Zed.

193
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,641
The Twin Turbos.

194
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,091
They're world-class racers.

195
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,121
You know, I hear they used to be
one plane and were separated at birth.

196
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,489
Wow. I wish I was separated at birth.

197
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,959
<i>Okay, people.</i>

198
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,039
<i>This is the last of four time trials
being held worldwide.</i>

199
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,123
<i>Today's qualifying round
is one lap around the pylons.</i>

200
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,282
<i>The top five finishers will qualify
for the Wings Around the Globe Rally.</i>

201
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,481
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

202
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,439
<i>Fonzarelli, you're up, my man.</i>

203
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,768
<i>Oh, man! That's nasty.</i>

204
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,161
<i>And he's through the start gate!</i>

205
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,766
<i>The racers must pass through
the blue pylons on the horizontal</i>

206
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,287
<i>and around the red pylons
on the knife-edge.</i>

207
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,239
<i>Now he's coming back to Gate Three!</i>

208
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,919
<i>Nicely done, my man.</i>

209
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,239
<i>Setting himself up a little high
through the blue pylons there,</i>

210
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,241
<i>lining up for the quadro.</i>

211
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,842
<i>He's taking a hard right with a
270-degree high-G turn! Yeah!</i>

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,923
<i>Back all the way around. Whoo!</i>

213
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,129
<i>- Cleanly through. Ha! Look at you, man!</i>
- That guy's good.

214
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,767
<i>It doesn't get much better than that.
All right. Good speed.</i>

215
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,924
<i>Lining up for the three-pylon chicane,
amazing pitch control.</i>

216
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,884
<i>Smooth! Fast! Clean!</i>

217
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,480
<i>He's going into the final turn,</i>

218
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,649
<i>into the half-Cuban 8,
pulling an aggressive 9.2 Gs.</i>

219
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,450
<i>Attacking the climb!</i>

220
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,931
<i>Wow. Now that's some speed.</i>

221
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,999
<i>Coming out of the Cuban 8 at
the end of a fantastic first run, people.</i>

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,240
<i>A 01.24.16.</i>

223
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,321
<i>A very good time for
the other racers to try and beat.</i>

224
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,288
<i>Fast, tight through the pylons.</i>

225
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,965
<i>He's got a great pace going, here.</i>

226
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,719
<i>He's just a half a second behind.</i>

227
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,484
<i>- Oh! Engine failure!</i>
- Oh!

228
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,085
<i>Out of the race. Bye-bye.</i>

229
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,686
<i>Great performance.
Watch the clock here.</i>

230
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,644
<i>I can't wait. Lining up for the Blue Gate.</i>

231
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,007
<i>Oh, no, he did not!
That's a major penalty.</i>

232
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,319
<i>Sony, dude. Eighth place.</i>

233
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,810
<i>Talk about fast.</i>

234
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,247
<i>Coming out the Cuban 8.</i>

235
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,645
Fueled and ready, man.

236
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,643
Okay, bud, you're up.

237
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,211
Good and tight.

238
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,639
- All set.
<i>- It's been a wonderful day here,</i>

239
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,051
<i>and we're down to our last competitor.</i>

240
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,571
This is it.

241
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,167
<i>From Propwash Junction,
Strut Jetstream.</i>

242
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,039
"Strut Jetstream"?

243
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,039
Yep. Awesomest call sign ever.
It was my idea.

244
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,247
- Ah. That explains it.
<i>- Hey, ag-plane!</i>

245
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,730
<i>Landscaping was yesterday, man.
Get off the runway. We're racing, here.</i>

246
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,959
<i>- Second call for Strut Jetstream.</i>
- No, no, no!

247
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,679
<i>- Looking for...</i>
- Yo! I'm Strut Jetstream.

248
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,079
<i>- You are Strut Jetstream?</i>
- Yep.

249
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,681
<i>A crop duster?
Man, what's going on here?</i>

250
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,679
<i>Is everybody getting to fly today?</i>

251
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,887
<i>Man, your momma must have
had high hopes for you.</i>

252
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,328
<i>Now, you know you are
built for seed, not speed.</i>

253
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,686
You have got to be kidding me.

254
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,359
That farmer's going to race?

255
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,567
Seriously, with a prop that small?

256
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,210
Maybe he races that leaky,

257
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,839
old fuel truck next to him.

258
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,966
Who are you calling leaky?

259
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,088
I'll leak on you,
if you don't check your intake.

260
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,199
Don't lower yourself to their level.

261
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,601
Go on Dus...
Go on, Strut.

262
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,531
Who's that guy?

263
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,400
- You're going to try out?
- A crop duster?

264
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,000
Cornfield is over that way.

265
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,122
Nice of you to take the day off
just to lose!

266
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,960
Go, Duster!

267
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,489
<i>It's going to be a tall order for him
to knock Fonzarelli out of fifth place.</i>

268
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,126
<i>And he's off!</i>

269
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,361
<i>Well, he's starting a little conservative.</i>

270
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,559
This ought to be rich.

271
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,881
<i>193 miles per hour.</i>

272
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,680
<i>He's into Gate Two,
clean through the horizontal.</i>

273
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,565
<i>What?
He's practically mowing the lawn.</i>

274
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,721
<i>Come to my house, man.</i>

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,599
<i>Okay. At the first split,
he's a full second behind Fonzarelli.</i>

276
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,439
<i>Yo, that's a lot of time to make up,
but this guy's aggressive.</i>

277
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,886
<i>Now he's making that hard
270-degree high-G turn!</i>

278
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,279
Whoo! That's it!

279
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,919
<i>Setting himself up. Left vertical turn.</i>

280
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,843
<i>Lining up for the three-pylon chicane.</i>

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,159
<i>He's gaining speed.</i>

282
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,242
<i>Now, he's only half a second
behind Fonzarelli.</i>

283
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,721
<i>And he is closing rapidly.</i>

284
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,924
<i>Now he's back on that stick.
Up he goes! Up and away!</i>

285
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,800
<i>Now only two-tenths of
a second behind Fonzarelli!</i>

286
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,079
- Come on, Duster!
<i>- Oh, it's going to be close.</i>

287
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,764
He's going to do it. He's going to do it.

288
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,242
<i>Oh, yes! What a finish!
Now, that's what you call flying!</i>

289
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,090
Way to go, Dustmeister.

290
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,330
That's what I'm talking about.

291
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,807
<i>Jetstream, the official time is</i>

292
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,442
<i>1 minute, 24.26 seconds.</i>

293
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,321
<i>Sixth place,
but what a close one, people.</i>

294
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,479
<i>Well, folks, that wraps up the trials
for the Wings Around the Globe Rally.</i>

295
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,882
Hey, pal, sixth place
ain't nothing to be ashamed of.

296
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,724
That was a heck of a run.

297
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,360
Thanks.

298
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,411
Ow! Dagnabbit! Let me drive!

299
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,086
There you go, topped off
and all set, Mayday.

300
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,084
Will you stop! Unbelievable!

301
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,319
Why don't you just go back!

302
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,322
I mean, I think you actually
missed a pothole!

303
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,879
Man, you got to be the worst,

304
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,521
I mean the worst delivery truck
that has ever delivered a delivery!

305
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,126
Can I help you?

306
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,999
Please tell me
this is Propwash Junction.

307
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,119
Sure is.

308
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,090
Oh, finally. You know,
you're not even on the map.

309
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,163
Yeah, pretty drive though, ain't it?

310
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,719
Oh, yeah. Especially if you
like looking at dirt and corn.

311
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,690
Anyway,
I'm looking for a Strut Jetstream.

312
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,810
- Who?
- Jetstream. Strut Jetstream.

313
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,401
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.
Do you have a photo?

314
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,679
Yeah, I got one right here.
No, I don't have a photo!

315
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,879
I have documentation that says

316
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,451
Strut Jetstream
lives in Propwash Junction.

317
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,807
Oh, whoa, whoa! Whoa,
wait a minute! Okay! Oh...

318
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,445
No, gosh I...

319
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,364
Hey, I'm Strut Jetstream.

320
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,079
Yeah! That's right!

321
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,084
I knew I'd remember.
There he is, strutting on over here.

322
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,811
But you're mispronouncing it slightly.

323
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,200
- I am?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

324
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,081
It's actually pronounced
"Dusty Crophopper."

325
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,528
Dusty Crophopper.

326
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,201
Yeah. It's Scandinavian.

327
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,759
Right, and I'm Egyptian.

328
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,679
Googly moogly!
What is that smell?

329
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,719
- It's Vita-minamulch.
- Vita-mina-what?

330
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,519
The finest-smelling compost
this side of the Mississippi.

331
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,719
Original, creamy and chunky style.

332
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,122
Oh, yeah.
Smell that? It's like daffodils

333
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,401
and like Sunday dinner.
I just love it. I love it.

334
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,929
<i>I got some minamulch, yeah!
I got some minamulch, yeah!</i>

335
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,439
That old airplane needs some help.
Y'all know that, right?

336
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,601
Yeah.

337
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,239
Are you familiar with
the racing fuel additive, nitro methane?

338
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,639
Oh, yeah! Zip juice! Go-go punch!

339
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,919
That stuff will blur your vision
and slur your speech.

340
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,159
- It's illegal.
- Totally illegal.

341
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,599
Wouldn't know what it looks like.
Yeah, you were saying?

342
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,559
That substance was found in the tank
of the fifth-place qualifier, Fonzarelli.

343
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,040
Illegal fuel intake is an automatic DQ.

344
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,442
Wait, so you're saying...

345
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,371
He's out, you're in. Congratulations.

346
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,930
- You're in?
- Hmm.

347
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,079
He's in!

348
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,923
You're never going to believe this.
He's in!

349
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,367
Dusty's in the race! Dottie, he's in!

350
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,090
What? Are you serious?

351
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,399
Whoo! Dusty.

352
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,159
Don't do anything crazy.
Fly safe.

353
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,479
Man, it's going to be cool.

354
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,086
You're going to cross oceans
thousands of miles wide.

355
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,083
Freezing your rudder off one day...

356
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,322
- And burning it off the next!
- Freaking hurricanes.

357
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,719
- Cyclones!
- Typhoons!

358
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,319
- Monsoons!
- Tornadoes!

359
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,959
- Sandstorms!
- Gale force winds!

360
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,200
Yeah!

361
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,326
Hmm.

362
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,965
Bad idea.

363
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,964
You'll end up a smoking hole
on the side of a mountain

364
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,119
with your parts
spread over five countries.

365
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,326
What makes you say that?

366
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,879
You're going up against
the best racers in the world.

367
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,530
And some of them don't even finish.

368
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,966
You're sloppy on your rolls,

369
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,322
wide on your turns,
slow on your straightaways.

370
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,639
You've been watching me?

371
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,529
Yeah, watching you
make a fool out of yourself.

372
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,759
You need to be tighter getting
in and out of your knife-edge.

373
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,839
Okay.

374
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,279
Any extra control input
costs you speed and seconds.

375
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,569
- So, you think I'm overcorrecting?
- Absolutely. Rookie mistake.

376
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,370
Are you giving me pointers?

377
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,370
No! I'm telling you to forget
all this racing malarkey.

378
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,091
You just ain't built for it.
You're a crop duster!

379
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,727
You don't think I know that?

380
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,087
I'm the one who's been
flying back and forth

381
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,650
across the same fields day after day,
month after month, for years!

382
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,408
I have flown thousands of miles

383
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,439
and I have never been anywhere.

384
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,487
Not like you.

385
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,442
You were built to fight,
and look what you did!

386
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,604
You're a hero.

387
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,239
I'm just trying to prove
that maybe, just maybe,

388
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,971
I can do more than what I was built for.

389
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,409
You know what? Just forget it.

390
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,088
You'll never understand.

391
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,206
0500, tomorrow. Don't be late.

392
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,203
Wait. 0500?

393
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,762
Yeah, 5:00 a.m.

394
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,483
Sparky, binoculars.

395
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,688
Those are some
mighty clean optics, there.

396
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,279
What do you use?
Some kind of shammy?

397
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,759
- Oh, no, it's a special microfiber cloth.
- Ah. Microfiber.

398
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,439
Yeah, lint-free, scratch-free.
I'll get you some.

399
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,920
I got an ex-Navy buddy
who sells them to me wholesale.

400
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,081
I helped him set up his web...

401
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,641
Knock it off. We got a lot of work to do.

402
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,088
I'll hook you up.
Thanks.

403
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,521
All right, Dusty, remember this.

404
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,086
It ain't how fast you fly,
it's how you fly fast.

405
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,601
- Roger that.
<i>- Show me what you got.</i>

406
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,128
Watch this! Oh, yeah.

407
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,449
<i>Great, you can
go up and down. What else?</i>

408
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,005
<i>- Show me your turns.</i>
- Here we go!

409
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,885
<i>You think that was good? That stunk!
Knife-edge those elm trees.</i>

410
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,969
Oh, come on. Keep your nose up!

411
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,963
Hey, Skip.

412
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,799
- You want speed, right?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

413
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,959
- Serious, bolt-rattling speed?
- Oh, yeah!

414
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,122
<i>Then look up.
Do you see those clouds?</i>

415
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,850
<i>The highway in the sky.</i>

416
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,844
<i>Tailwinds like nothing
you've ever flown.</i>

417
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,843
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

418
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,128
<i>Come on, power up. Firewall thrust.</i>

419
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,123
<i>Max torque, max torque!</i>

420
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,645
<i>All right, looking good.</i>

421
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,922
<i>Hold V-Y, Dusty. Max rate, now.</i>

422
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,171
<i>Your nose is too high.
Get your nose down.</i>

423
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,128
<i>You're going to stall.
Ease off the pitch. Nose down!</i>

424
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,321
Oh!

425
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,805
Hey, what are you doing?

426
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,688
What just happened up there?

427
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,484
I'm... I'm low on fuel.

428
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,926
Do I look like I was built yesterday?

429
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,926
- No, no. It's a long story.
- I got time.

430
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,679
Uh...

431
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,199
Okay, well, um, you know,

432
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,044
I feel like I was having some problems
with my axial compressor so...

433
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,159
The Jolly Wrenches have a motto,
<i>Volo Pro Veritas.</i>

434
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,686
It means "I fly for truth."

435
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,845
Clearly, you don't.

436
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,201
Sparky, push me back to the hangar.

437
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,649
I'm afraid of heights.

438
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,410
- But you're a plane.
- I'm a crop duster.

439
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,727
I've never flown over a thousand feet.

440
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,479
Are you kidding?

441
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,484
Scared of heights and you want to
race around the world?

442
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,365
Uh, Skip, during the attack
of Tujunga Harbor,

443
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,040
why, even the P-38s
had trouble at high altitudes.

444
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,170
Well, they didn't have to fly
over the Himalayas, did they?

445
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,880
I'll still be low to the ground,
just high up.

446
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,560
And after the war,
those 38s went on to win races.

447
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,886
Really? Is that true?

448
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,399
Yeah, true.
Like in the Cleveland race of '46.

449
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,209
- For real?
- Wait, it gets better.

450
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,206
In '49, the P-38 Sky Ranger
averaged 337 miles per hour.

451
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,441
Wait, 337?

452
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,604
Well, actually 337.4, but they
round it down in the record books.

453
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,767
Why would you do that?

454
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,251
Some people just have
no respect for decimal points.

455
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,719
- Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.
- Why couldn't they round it up?

456
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,246
- Seriously, he...
- All right, all right.

457
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,443
So, you're a flat-hatter.
We'll work on that.

458
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,321
But for now let's see if we can turn
low and sloppy into low and fast.

459
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,931
Roger that.

460
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,200
It'll go like this.

461
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,719
<i>The flag marks the start line.</i>

462
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,239
<i>Across the cornfield,
three silos are waiting for you.</i>

463
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,759
<i>Slalom those with a radial-G pass.</i>

464
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,079
<i>Wait. "A radial" what pass?</i>

465
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,161
<i>Once you get to the trees,</i>

466
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,919
<i>go to your optimal rate of climb
to about 500 feet.</i>

467
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,969
<i>Roll inverted and extend,
trading altitude for air speed</i>

468
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,519
<i>- and dive toward the finish line.</i>
- Uh, okay.

469
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,279
You string all that together,
you might have a chance to beat him.

470
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,281
Who am I racing?

471
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,159
Here he comes.

472
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,130
He's a twin commuter
pushing about 1500 horsepower.

473
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,920
<i>Uh, he's pretty high up.</i>

474
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,129
<i>You're not racing him,
you're racing his shadow.</i>

475
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,446
<i>Beat it to the water tower.</i>

476
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,768
<i>Let's do this! Thread the silos!</i>

477
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,523
<i>Tighter! Lean into your turns more.</i>

478
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,884
- His turns are terrible.
- Yeah.

479
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,531
<i>Let's go, Dusty. Faster.</i>

480
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,081
You're falling behind.

481
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,527
<i>Begin your climb
and catch him in the dive.</i>

482
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,808
<i>Start your dive now.</i>

483
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,122
Never mind, you already lost.

484
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,647
So, we can increase power
or we can decrease drag.

485
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,051
Definitely increase power.

486
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,485
More torque means more speed.

487
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,211
Lousy.

488
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,522
<i>Come on, let's work that radial-G turn.</i>

489
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,166
<i>Do it again. One more time. Again!</i>

490
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,281
<i>Come on! Push it, Dusty!</i>

491
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,921
Better!

492
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,684
Remember now, altitude for airspeed.

493
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,841
Gravity is your ally.

494
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,962
The laws of physics govern speed.

495
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,522
All right, Dusty.
Give this run all you've got.

496
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,399
<i>Use your radial-G.</i>

497
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,811
<i>Let gravity work for you.</i>

498
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,479
<i>Looking good.
That's what I'm talking about.</i>

499
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,687
Firewall the throttle! Go! Go! Go!

500
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,570
You got it, Duster!

501
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,760
<i>Begin your climb!</i>

502
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,919
<i>All right, altitude for airspeed.</i>

503
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,251
<i>Catch him in the dive!</i>

504
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,164
<i>Dive now!</i>

505
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,049
Ballistic!

506
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,408
<i>He kicked
Aston Martins out there!</i>

507
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,768
- Dusterino!
- He's ready.

508
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,199
- Whoa!
- Oh, that's cool.

509
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,363
The piston and cross-wrenches.
Your squadron insignia.

510
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,646
- You've earned it.
- It fits you.

511
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,603
- It fits you, Dusty.
- Now, listen.

512
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,569
When the race starts and
all those planes take off,

513
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,603
it'll stir up a bunch of swirlies

514
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,121
just like the Wrenches ran into
in the Battle of Airway.

515
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,561
Roger that. Sure wish
you were coming with me, Skip.

516
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,200
Just radio back when
you get to the check points.

517
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,249
I'll be your wingman from here.

518
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,323
<i>Volo Pro Veritas,</i> right?

519
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,562
<i>Volo Pro Veritas.</i>

520
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,799
- Kick some tail, buddy.
- We're all proud of you.

521
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,211
Whoo-hoo! Dustmeister!

522
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,211
Wow.

523
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,439
<i>Break, break.</i>

524
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,159
<i>Air racer number 7, Air racer number 7.</i>

525
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,288
<i>Do you read? Kennedy approach, over.</i>

526
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,081
I'm Dusty Crophopper,
I'm looking for JFK airport.

527
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,639
<i>Crophopper 7, you are supposed
to be on the Carnice visual.</i>

528
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,324
<i>Turn further left, heading 1-9-5.</i>

529
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,450
<i>Maintain 1,000 feet.
Intercept the 22 right localizer.</i>

530
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,441
<i>You are cleared for
the ILS 22, right approach.</i>

531
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,679
- Roger.
<i>- Heavy is sectored in behind you.</i>

532
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,841
Run that by me one more time.

533
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,759
<i>Turn further left,
heading 1-9-5. Maintain 1, 000...</i>

534
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,881
Never mind. I got it.

535
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,281
Do you see him?

536
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,689
Well, radar does, but I don't see diddly.

537
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,129
Check out this pavement!
Nice! It's so smooth.

538
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,005
<i>Crophopper 7, you passed Foxtrot.
Turn left onto Charlie.</i>

539
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,161
<i>Hold short at 22.</i>

540
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,124
Wait, I thought...

541
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,691
<i>- Get off the runway!</i>
- Whoa!

542
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,970
- Oh. Sorry.
- Go back to Jersey, you bum.

543
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,201
Excuse me, where can I...

544
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,522
Hey-ho, do you mind? I'm working here.

545
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,839
Sorry.

546
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,447
A nice enough guy, but way too much
baggage, if you know what I mean.

547
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,961
Oh, hey, there. I'm looking for pit row.

548
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,849
The pits? Oh, yeah, that's easy.

549
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,367
You want to go down this way
toward the fire station.

550
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,166
Then taxiway alpha forks off to the left.

551
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,559
But don't go that way.
You want to veer right.

552
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,530
And if you get to the orange barrels,
you went too far. So...

553
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,523
Just go straight ahead and to the right.

554
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,002
Great, thanks. Hey, nice paint job.

555
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,521
Well, thank you! I'm kind of proud of it.

556
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,206
- I think he was talking to me.
- Oh.

557
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,926
Well, looky who's here.
The Scandinavian.

558
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,929
- Hey. Uh...
- Miss your home town?

559
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,559
I don't. Just about blocked
that memory out of my mind.

560
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,239
But you're bringing it
right back with that...

561
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,040
Oh, man, that nasty
Vita-mina-stink-a-bunch.

562
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,519
Your tent's the last one on the left. Go!

563
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,010
Okay.

564
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,084
Power wash is on the right. Just saying.

565
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,879
Wow! Bulldog?
From the European Cup? The Big Dog!

566
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,929
Hey, I saw you do this unbelievable
high-G vertical turn.

567
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,041
How did you do that?

568
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,531
Well, let me tell you.

569
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,241
In fact, why don't I tell you
all my racing secrets?

570
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,244
- Really?
- No.

571
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,004
Look, I don't know how things work

572
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,679
in the backwater
from which you hail, matey,

573
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,250
but this is a competition.

574
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,404
Every plane for himself! Goodbye.

575
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,244
Yeah, sure.

576
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,730
- Whoa... Whoa!
- Oh.

577
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,879
Uh... Oh.

578
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,239
Wait a second. This is aeroshell 100.

579
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,641
I thought I ordered the DT-2380.

580
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,802
Well, I am sorry you had to see that.

581
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,919
- Are you all right?
- Sure. Why wouldn't I be?

582
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,879
And you are Pan-Asian Champion
and Mumbai Cup record holder, Ishani.

583
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,119
Most people call me just "Ishani."

584
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,600
I'm Dusty. I mean, uh,
my name is Dusty.

585
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,610
I'm not actually dusty,
I'm quite clean.

586
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,890
It's very nice to meet you,
"quite clean" Dusty.

587
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,770
Nice to meet you, too.

588
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,763
Look at that propeller.

589
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,121
Ooh.

590
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,442
A little over there.
Not so much pressure, okay?

591
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,762
Oh, excuse me, guys. Pardon me.

592
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,011
Yeah.

593
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,571
Hey, look who made it!

594
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,770
- It's the crop duster.
- Hey.

595
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,526
You know, having you here
is a nice vehicle-interest story.

596
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,642
Small-town farmer
makes it to the big time.

597
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,999
Yes, sir.

598
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,162
- But tragically crashes on takeoff.
- What?

599
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,919
Wings Around The Globe winner,
Ripslinger,

600
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,209
eulogizes the unknown hayseed
and scatters his debris over a cornfield.

601
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,970
Ratings will be through the roof!

602
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,929
- Okay.
- Good luck.

603
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,839
- Farm boy.
- What?

604
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,965
The hero of the people has arrived.

605
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,362
You have never heard
of the great El Chupacabra?

606
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,923
Hey, isn't that that monster
that siphons fuel from small vehicles?

607
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,279
No, no, no, it's just a stage name

608
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,046
designed to strike fear into the hearts
of my opponents.

609
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,130
Yeah, he's the indoor racing
champion of all Mexico.

610
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,281
Indoor racing?

611
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,765
And <i>numero uno</i> recording artist,
telenovela star and romance novelist.

612
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,766
Did you say El Chupacabra
or El Cuckoo-sabre?

613
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,646
You make joke? You make joke?

614
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,839
Very well. You leave me no choice!

615
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,526
I swish my cape at you!

616
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,044
You have been shamed.

617
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,888
I hope I can get over it.

618
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,361
Oh. I just did!

619
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,959
Hey, I saw you race
on Telemoto last year.

620
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,239
Of course, it was in Spanish,
so I didn't understand everything.

621
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,083
I am flattered, <i>avión pequeño.</i>

622
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,766
You have done many of these
long distance rallies, yes?

623
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,879
- No, this is my first one.
- It is my first time, as well!

624
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,087
We will have many adventures,
you and I.

625
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,759
We will laugh, we will cry,
we will dance!

626
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,761
Um... Wow.

627
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,008
- Probably not with each other.
- Of course.

628
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,362
I will see you in the skies, amigo.

629
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,239
<i>Race fans,
it's that time of year again.</i>

630
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,891
<i>Welcome to the
Wings Around The Globe.</i>

631
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,283
Hello, I'm Brent Mustangburger,

632
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,523
and this is the flagship event
of the world's fastest sport

633
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,887
where only the best
of the best compete.

634
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,566
<i>Each leg brings a new challenge,</i>

635
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,446
<i>testing agility, navigation
and endurance.</i>

636
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,731
But when it's all said and done,
speed is the name of the game.

637
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,719
Our very own Colin Cowling

638
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,770
is standing by live from JFK airport
with the best seat in the house.

639
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,331
How's the view, big guy?

640
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,399
Brent, the scene below me
is absolutely electric.

641
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,971
As you know, we have racers
from all over the world, here.

642
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,885
But the real story should be
who's coming in second

643
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,123
to three-time defending champ,
Ripslinger,

644
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,250
who is seeking to become
the first four-time winner

645
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,811
<i>in the Wings Around The Globe.</i>

646
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,442
<i>The racers
are making their way to the runway.</i>

647
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,721
- It's Dusty!
- Whoo!

648
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,119
All right, everybody,
get your Dusty bobbleheads.

649
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,999
Your oven mitts, hats, bumper stickers,
and I also ordered

650
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,279
a thousand commemorative whistles.

651
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,850
Hey, you think you can help me
set up a website?

652
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,445
Does a giga bite?

653
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,608
Well, not if you pet him nicely.

654
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,326
Dusty.

655
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,959
<i>One-hundred and thirty-six
nations compete.</i>

656
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,008
<i>Twenty-one planes selected.</i>

657
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,760
<i>Folks, a step onto this field,
is a step into history.</i>

658
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,482
Holy smokes!

659
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,841
And for the first time ever, folks,
we have a crop duster in the race.

660
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,122
A crop duster?

661
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,486
Well, he's gonna die.

662
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,324
Ripslinger! Ripslinger!

663
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,759
Wow!

664
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,359
Ripslinger! Ripslinger! Ripslinger!

665
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,080
Yeah. You're caught in the riptide!

666
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,362
Whoa. Look at this crowd.

667
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,161
Stay focused, <i>amigo.</i>
Don't let anything distract you.

668
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,281
Ay-yay!

669
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,199
Who is that vision?

670
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,044
That's Rochelle,
the Canadian rally champ.

671
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,319
She is like an angel, sent from heaven.

672
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,961
Like a sunrise
after a lifetime of darkness.

673
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:52,246
Like fresh fertilizer
on a field of dying grass.

674
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,722
This is not your thing, my friend.

675
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,441
<i>All right, racers.
Start your engines!</i>

676
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,520
<i>Seven legs,
over 31, 000 kilometers,</i>

677
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,763
<i>The world's highest mountains,
and the deepest oceans</i>

678
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,126
<i>all stand before them</i>

679
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,365
<i>just waiting to be conquered
by the right competitor.</i>

680
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,328
Here we go. Oh, boy!

681
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,879
<i>All the preparation.</i>

682
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,644
<i>It all comes down to this moment.</i>

683
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,759
<i>One of these planes is about to fly off
into the pages of sports history</i>

684
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,808
<i>and become a champion.</i>

685
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,641
Go!

686
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,602
<i>And we are under way!</i>

687
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,325
Whoa! Swirlies!

688
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,846
Whoa! Whoa.

689
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,359
<i>Our first stage is a Whopper.</i>

690
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,488
<i>A dead sprint across the North Atlantic.</i>

691
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,881
<i>That's right, Brent.
This is how it works, folks.</i>

692
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,607
<i>The winner of the leg today
is the first to take off tomorrow.</i>

693
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,524
Hey, look who's finally here!
It's that low-flying farmer boy!

694
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,200
You do know this is a race, right?

695
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,520
That's a good one, boss.

696
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,602
Excuse me, how much does
a snow plow weigh?

697
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,131
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i> I do not know.

698
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,887
Enough to break the ice.
I am El Chupacabra.

699
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,362
- Ah. You are the snow plow, oui?
- You could say that, yes.

700
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,803
- And I am the ice?
- Yes.

701
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,485
Cold, frozen and lifeless?

702
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,927
No, I... It sounds better in Spanish.

703
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,731
Why don't you go
plow yourself, El Chu-toy?

704
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,641
She is like an angel.

705
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,959
<i>This is Propwash
Junction to Dusty Crophopper.</i>

706
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,961
I read you, Chug.

707
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,447
<i>So what's it like
racing with the big dogs, Duster?</i>

708
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,599
- Well, my wings froze solid.
<i>- Man!</i>

709
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,799
- I had icicles hanging off my sprayer.
<i>- All right!</i>

710
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,399
And I nearly smashed
into a 10-story iceberg.

711
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,561
<i>Awesome!</i>

712
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,959
<i>Yeah, "awesome" is not quite
the word that I would use</i>

713
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,769
<i>to describe a gruesome
near-death experience.</i>

714
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,001
You hang in there, buddy.

715
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,403
There's nothing better than dying
while doing what you love most.

716
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,602
<i>That's gonna make
him feel a lot better.</i>

717
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,802
Dusty, just like when
the Jolly Wrenches

718
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,079
were up in the Aleutians

719
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,606
the air down close to the sea
has more moisture,

720
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,250
which is why you took on ice.

721
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,839
<i>- You gotta try to fly higher.</i>
- Great.

722
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,966
<i>The good news is</i>

723
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,805
<i>tomorrow's leg goes through
the Bavarian obstacle course.</i>

724
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,203
<i>It's all about agility,
so it's your chance to move up.</i>

725
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,443
<i>And remember, it's not speed
that wins races, it's skill.</i>

726
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,011
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm blinded. I can't see.</i>

727
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,119
We're receiving breaking news

728
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,959
of an incident in the skies over
Germany involving one of the racers.

729
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,486
Let's check in with Skycam 1
for more information.

730
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,802
Bulldog, the legendary flyer from

731
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,845
the UK, is in tremendous danger.

732
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,487
<i>It looks like he's flying blind,
losing speed, losing altitude...</i>

733
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,759
Wait! It's Racer Number 7, Crophopper,

734
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,440
- pulling up beside him.
- What's he doing?

735
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,199
- Bulldog, apply your left aileron.
- Okay.

736
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,201
Stop roll.

737
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,639
- Now, quick, pull up.
- Got it.

738
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,721
Harder, harder!

739
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,968
Slight roll right. Good!

740
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,523
Whoa! Big castle!
Pull up! Hard roll right!

741
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,727
Stop roll.

742
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,879
Are you still there?

743
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,920
I'm right here.
I'll fly right alongside you.

744
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,004
<i>Achtung! We have
a mayday! Clear the runway!</i>

745
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,003
Achtung! <i>Clear the runway!</i>

746
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,525
- Add power.
- Okay.

747
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,727
- Easy, now.
- Yes.

748
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,362
Good. Flaps down, lock them.

749
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,966
Careful.

750
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,127
Landing gear down.

751
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,481
Yeah, and locked.

752
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,045
Begin your flare.

753
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,759
Power back a little.

754
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,290
Touchdown! Nicely done!

755
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,250
Thanks for your help, matey.

756
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,879
I couldn't have done it without...

757
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,724
You? You saved me?

758
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,399
What did I tell you, boy?
Every plane for himself, right?

759
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,290
Where I come from, if you see someone
falling from the sky...

760
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,166
Yes, but this is a competition.
Now, you're dead last.

761
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,806
And I owe you my life.

762
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,281
Are you crying?

763
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,562
I don't cry, I'm British!

764
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,405
Thanks, matey.

765
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,723
Sure thing, Bulldog.

766
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,639
Bulldog!

767
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,606
Well, I gotta say,
crop duster, you are a nice guy.

768
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,919
Hey. Thanks, Rip.

769
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,241
And we all know where nice guys finish.

770
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,084
Yeah!

771
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,007
Dead last.

772
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,082
You sad, you drink.

773
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,925
Thanks. Great advice.

774
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,448
At least you are not last
in the race for love.

775
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,761
Rochelle?

776
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,960
Her passion is, sadly, not for me.

777
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,642
Tough break, El Chu.

778
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,759
Excuse me.

779
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,519
My name is Franz, and I am a huge fan.

780
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,999
- I have fans?
- Oh, no, no, no. Just me.

781
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,847
And I would like to say <i>danke</i>
for representing all us little planes.

782
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,169
Uh... You're a car.

783
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,999
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I am
what you call a <i>Flugzeugauto,</i>

784
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,970
one of only six flying cars ever built!

785
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,323
- Whoa!
<i>- Guten Tag, Herr</i> Dusty.

786
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,088
I am Von Fliegenhozen.

787
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,879
Didn't you just say
your name was Franz?

788
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,086
<i>Nein, nein, nein.</i>

789
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,239
Franz is a guy with no spine

790
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,239
who is in charge
when we putter about the cobblestones.

791
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,084
In the air, I am in charge.

792
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,643
This guy needs to
get his head gasket checked.

793
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,485
Serious identity issues.

794
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,889
This from the one wearing a mask?

795
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,251
Touché.

796
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,040
We are both pulling for you, <i>Herr</i> Dusty.

797
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,001
Thanks for the support.
I need all the help I can get.

798
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,839
I have a humble suggestion.

799
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,524
Would you not be much faster

800
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,729
without the pipes and tank
and whatnot weighing you down?

801
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,211
My Sprayer. Again?

802
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,846
Yeah.
Why carry around the extra weight?

803
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,679
The little crazy car is right.

804
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,251
Perhaps you need to start
thinking like a racer.

805
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,519
This is reversible, right?

806
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,079
Oh! Oh. Hey, you're being
careful down there, right?

807
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,208
Whoa. Ooh! Yep, that's cold.

808
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,039
So?

809
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,810
So, what do you think?

810
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,839
<i>Wunderbar,</i> Dusty.

811
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,205
<i>Fantastico.</i>

812
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,771
It is freeing, yes?

813
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,201
Yeah, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

814
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,290
Bye-bye, sprayer!

815
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,966
Thanks for everything, Franz...
Er, Von Fliegenhozen.

816
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,804
<i>Guten</i> luck, <i>Herr</i> Dusty.

817
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,519
<i>It's our third leg</i>

818
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,839
<i>and we've already lost several
competitors to equipment failure.</i>

819
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,730
<i>But the real story here, Brent,
is Dusty Crophopper.</i>

820
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,927
Absolutely.

821
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,959
He's passing one flier after another.

822
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,645
<i>That's right. This guy
was built to dust crops,</i>

823
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,928
<i>but he's dusting the competition.</i>

824
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,483
<i>What's next, Colin?</i>

825
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,399
<i>Brent, this could be
Crophopper's leg, all the way.</i>

826
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,404
<i>The racers will have to fly
under a hard ceiling of 1,000 feet.</i>

827
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,924
<i>Stay under the clouds and in the hills.</i>

828
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,685
Number 20 is disqualified.

829
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,959
<i>- What a move.</i>
<i>- Incredible.</i>

830
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,281
<i>- Look at that radial-G pass.</i>
- Oh, yeah!

831
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,919
<i>From last place,
all the way up to eighth.</i>

832
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,279
<i>Mr. Ripslinger,
you were built for racing.</i>

833
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,480
<i>Yeah! You know it.</i>

834
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,523
<i>So how can a crop duster out-fly you?</i>

835
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,919
<i>- Wait, what?
- There he is!</i>

836
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,921
<i>Dusty!</i>

837
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,039
- Wow!
<i>- How do you keep up with the pros?</i>

838
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,359
<i>Did working
on the farm make you stronger?</i>

839
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,120
<i>Dusty!
Why do you fly so low?</i>

840
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,519
Why are they wasting their time
with him?

841
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,124
He's a tractor with wings.

842
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,439
Actually, it's a really
compelling underdog story.

843
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,519
It's like <i>Rocky.</i>

844
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,919
It's more like David and Goliath.

845
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,479
- Or <i>Old Yeller.</i>
- That's not an underdog story.

846
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,005
- Well, there's a dog in it.
- Enough!

847
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,406
Yeah, enough!

848
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,682
You know, they shot Old Yeller
at the end, you twits.

849
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,001
Oh! Spoiler alert!

850
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,409
Soon, we'll be overrun by every banner
tower, skywriter and air freighter

851
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,171
who thinks they can be one of us.

852
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,803
That farm boy forgot who he is
and where he came from.

853
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,329
He's not about to stop me
from making history.

854
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,319
<i>Dusty, Dusty,
where did you learn to race?</i>

855
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,367
<i>From my coach, Skipper.</i>

856
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,120
<i>He's the reason I'm even here.
He's an amazing instructor.</i>

857
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,847
<i>And a great friend.</i>

858
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,004
<i>He flew dozens of missions
all around the world.</i>

859
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,164
<i>And I'm sure, if he could,
he'd be with us right now.</i>

860
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,039
Whoa, your engine
sounds kind of rough.

861
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,566
Must be a mag misfire.

862
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,966
It's probably not a good night
for flying anyway.

863
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,569
- Okay. Come back soon.
- Hey, you got anything new?

864
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,919
I'm glad you asked.

865
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,766
I'm now selling these one-of-a-kind
Dusty commemorative mugs.

866
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,606
Huh?

867
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,961
Whoa!

868
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,720
<i>This is Dusty Crophopper calling...</i>

869
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,119
- I'll be back in 10.
- Dusty, eighth place!

870
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,849
Way to go, Dustmeister!

871
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,959
- Hey! You finally removed your M5000.
- His what?

872
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,281
His Micro-Air-5000-D-L
Aerial Applicator.

873
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,010
Use your words.

874
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,525
His sprayer.

875
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,519
Right! Sprayer.

876
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,090
Dusty, you got a big leg tomorrow.

877
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,083
- Yeah.
<i>- How you feeling?</i>

878
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,481
<i>I can't believe it.
The mighty Himalayas.</i>

879
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,608
<i>Dusty, that vertical wind shear</i>

880
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,279
is going to be wicked
over those mountains.

881
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,279
Well, the good thing
about being that high up,

882
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,009
you see, there's not a lot of oxygen.

883
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,929
So, if you crash, no explosion.

884
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,279
Great, Chug.

885
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,119
<i>Of course,
you could die of hypothermia</i>

886
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,770
<i>or an avalanche could get you.</i>

887
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,769
<i>Then, of course, there's
pneumonia, or even frostbite.</i>

888
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,325
Chug, Chug, I got it.

889
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,639
Skip, what if a guy wanted to fly

890
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,359
through the mountains
instead of over them?

891
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,284
<i>Bad idea. The Wrenches
flew through terrain like that</i>

892
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,568
in the Assault of Kunming.
And Dottie is right.

893
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,719
Wind coming over the peaks
can stir up rotors

894
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,960
<i>that'll drag you right down.</i>

895
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,487
<i>If you ask me, it's time to lug-nut up.</i>

896
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,689
<i>You can fly a whole lot higher
than you think.</i>

897
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,959
- Roger that.
<i>- Hola, corazón.</i>

898
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,799
- Are you tired?
- What?

899
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,771
Because you have been flying
through my mind, nonstop.

900
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,331
Hmm. And why would I be tired flying
through such a teeny, tiny space, huh?

901
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,246
You can only pretend for so long.

902
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,962
Hey, El Chu, what's the problem?

903
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,201
I am Icarus and she is the sun.

904
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,483
I fly too close and I melt.

905
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,085
Maybe you're trying too hard.

906
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,165
Look, all you got to do is go over,
open your mouth and say...

907
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,606
Hello.

908
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,001
Wha... Uh...

909
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,521
Whoa.

910
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,079
El Chupacabra!

911
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,526
I think someone is calling me.
I have to go.

912
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,931
I wanted to compliment you
on your success, Dusty.

913
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,129
You're doing very well
for your first race.

914
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,839
Aw, that means a lot, coming from you.

915
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,205
I mean, come on,

916
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,639
you were named most aerodynamic
racer by <i>Air Sports Illustrated.</i>

917
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,079
And let me just say,
you are so aerodynamic.

918
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,684
Dusty.

919
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,800
What's with
all the tractors around here?

920
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,279
They're sacred.

921
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,359
Many believe that
we will be recycled as tractors.

922
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,489
Oh. Well, I believe in recycling.

923
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,722
Have you ever been to the Taj Mahal?

924
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,959
No. No, I haven't.

925
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,724
Come on. Let's go.

926
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,164
It must be nice to be back home.

927
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,881
Well, it's complicated.
I have a billion fans.

928
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,969
And they're all expecting me to win.

929
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,287
Maybe this time, you will.

930
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,441
Wow.

931
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,802
This place is amazing.

932
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,291
It really is.

933
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,365
And tomorrow, you'll fly over
the magnificent Himalayas.

934
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,966
Those little hills?
Yeah, well... No big deal.

935
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,282
You like to fly low, don't you?

936
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,966
Oh. Oh, that? Uh, that's strategic.

937
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,362
Air density and, uh, combustion.

938
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,326
You know, you could follow
the Iron Compass, instead.

939
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,330
- Iron Compass?
- Yeah, rail road tracks.

940
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,649
Through a valley in the mountains,
so you can still fly low.

941
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,290
Really?

942
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,050
Thanks, Ishani.

943
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,645
Anytime.

944
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,039
<i>Every racer's nightmare
is scaling the Himalayas.</i>

945
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,203
<i>It's a short leg ahead,
but extremely treacherous.</i>

946
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,161
No.

947
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,041
Ow! Ah!

948
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,006
Whoa!

949
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,286
Whoa!

950
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,599
Uh...

951
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,443
Hello?

952
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,531
Is this where I'm supposed to be?

953
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,684
That is one of life's great questions.

954
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,124
I'm dead!

955
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,446
Mr. Crophopper.

956
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,403
Welcome to Nepal.

957
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,126
I don't understand.
Have the others left already?

958
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,519
Actually, no one else is here yet.

959
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,921
You're in first place.

960
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,167
Really?

961
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,409
He flew through a what?

962
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,919
- A tunnel?
- That is crazy!

963
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,446
Si, crazy like a Firefox.

964
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,279
Dusty, how does it feel
to be in first place?

965
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,441
It feels great.

966
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,649
But more than anything,
I'm just happy I fit through that tunnel.

967
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,200
Guys, I gotta tell you,
if you're ever in a tight squeeze just...

968
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,645
Excuse me, guys.

969
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,363
Crazy day today, huh?

970
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,965
Oh. Yeah, a very exciting
win for you today.

971
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,327
Quite a risk you took.

972
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,479
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, your propeller, is it new?

973
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,642
Oh. I suppose it is.

974
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,639
Sky Slycer Mark Five, right?

975
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,644
Aren't those made exclusively
for Ripslinger's race team?

976
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,531
- Are they?
- Yeah. Yeah, they are.

977
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,205
Dusty...

978
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,920
- You set me up.
- Look, I didn't ever want to hurt you.

979
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,159
- Why?
- It's complicated, okay?

980
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,799
You could have gotten me
killed out there today.

981
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,326
I really thought that
you'd just turn around.

982
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,679
Well, you were wrong.

983
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,444
And I was wrong about you.

984
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,365
Hey, Rip. Thanks for first place.

985
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,759
<i>Flying low and quick,</i>

986
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,764
<i>Dusty Crophopper is managing
to hold on to the top spot.</i>

987
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,243
<i>But current reigning champ, Ripslinger,
is just seconds behind him.</i>

988
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,204
<i>This surprise battle for first place</i>

989
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,362
has made Dusty Crophopper
the one to watch.

990
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,088
<i>He's become a working-class hero
around the globe.</i>

991
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,731
Whoa!

992
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,565
I told you he could do it.

993
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,439
- That's it.
- Wha... Aw!

994
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,442
That was my skyPad, man.

995
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,762
A new one's
coming out in two weeks.

996
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,359
<i>You're really showing them
big-time racers a thing or two, huh?</i>

997
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,319
Yeah. We head out across
the Pacific tomorrow, Skip.

998
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,119
You were stationed there
for a while, right?

999
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,279
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Got any advice?

1000
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,284
Back in '41,
during the Battle over Wake Island

1001
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,039
<i>the Wrenches ran into
serious monsoons</i>

1002
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,959
<i>with embedded CBs that could
tear your wings right off.</i>

1003
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,406
<i>Be careful. And one more thing...</i>

1004
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,045
I'm proud of you, Dusty.

1005
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,327
Thanks, wingman.

1006
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,251
Hey, Dusty, we have a surprise for you.

1007
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,559
Oh, oh, oh!
You have to let me tell him.

1008
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,439
Go ahead, Chug.

1009
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,240
Uh... Oh, I know it. It's...
It's on the tip of my tongue.

1010
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,519
I'll remember.

1011
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,090
We're going...

1012
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,159
<i>We're going...</i>

1013
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,083
- to...
- To...

1014
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,559
- Mmm...
- Malays...

1015
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,799
- Mexico.
- Mexico! That's it!

1016
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,531
- We're going to meet you in Mexico.
- Really?

1017
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,643
Yep. Tickets are on Sparky and me.

1018
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,010
We sold 326 Dusty bobbleheads,
143 antenna balls,

1019
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,003
203 spinner mugs...

1020
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:34,166
And 1,000 whistles.
Go, Team Dusterino! Yeah!

1021
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,090
You sure you're up for it, Skipper?

1022
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,761
You bet.
Somebody else is doing the flying.

1023
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,201
That's great news, guys.
I'll see you in Mexico.

1024
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,399
<i>Buenas noches!</i>

1025
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,129
<i>I'll bring the salsa!
Whoo-hoo!</i>

1026
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,962
Hey, El Chu, where's the fire?

1027
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,083
It is in my soul.

1028
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,369
Tonight, I shall win the heart

1029
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,603
of Miss Rochelle.

1030
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,448
Ugh!

1031
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,004
No, no, no. A thousand no's.

1032
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,528
Dusty, what are you doing?

1033
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,687
Low and slow.

1034
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,408
Oh...

1035
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,570
What does that mean?

1036
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:12,124
No idea, but French-Canadian
is the language of love in Quebec.

1037
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,486
So, it's got to be good.

1038
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,250
I'm in your debt, <i>compadre.</i>

1039
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,370
If ever you need me, I shall be there.

1040
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,643
<i>Compadre.</i> I like that.

1041
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,959
You are looking live

1042
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,691
at Pudong Shanghai
International Airport...

1043
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,604
Yep. First place.
Not too bad for a farm boy.

1044
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,359
Oh, yeah?

1045
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,203
Well, first place is for losers.

1046
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,089
Can it, moron!

1047
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,201
- Ow!

1048
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,603
Now, listen up.
It's time to make yourselves useful.

1049
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,320
What happened to you?

1050
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,450
That song. It flipped a switch.

1051
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,729
Oh, my little monster.
Come here.

1052
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,441
Please! No!

1053
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,806
She is like a jaguar now.

1054
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,325
Oh, my little burrito.

1055
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,646
Be gentle with me!

1056
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,929
<i>Start your engines.</i>

1057
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,287
<i>This is our sixth
and longest leg.</i>

1058
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,046
<i>These racers will need to
follow their GPS antennas</i>

1059
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,921
<i>because there's a big ocean
between here and Mexico.</i>

1060
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,121
Ah!

1061
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,126
My antenna!

1062
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,042
Oh, no! No! No!

1063
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,004
What am I going to do?

1064
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,050
<i>Last known coordinates,</i>

1065
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,089
<i>26 degrees, 31 minutes.</i>

1066
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,691
<i>Hawaii, are you there?</i>

1067
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,879
Do you read? I am low on fuel.

1068
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,121
Oh, no!

1069
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,727
Oh, boy.

1070
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1071
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,647
Unknown rider, unknown rider.
You have entered restricted airspace.

1072
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,560
Why haven't you responded
to radio contact?

1073
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,091
<i>Somebody cut off my antenna.</i>

1074
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,686
<i>- Identify yourself.
- I'm Dusty Crophopper.</i>

1075
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,881
<i>Roger that.</i>

1076
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,565
Bogey has been identified
as Crophopper Seven.

1077
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,808
I'm running on vapors. I need to land.

1078
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,849
What are you doing out here
with an empty tank?

1079
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,650
I thought I'd refuel in Hawaii, but...

1080
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,439
Hawaii is 375 miles southwest of here.

1081
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,441
- What?
- Listen, Crophopper.

1082
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,891
You better follow us to the boat.

1083
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,366
No bingo fields around here.

1084
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,959
- "Bingo fields"?
- Places to land.

1085
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,964
- The boat?
<i>- The USS Dwight D. Flysenhower.</i>

1086
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,759
<i>Bravo, checking in as frag plus one.
Check.</i>

1087
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,285
<i>- Two.
- Go ahead, Bravo.</i>

1088
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,279
<i>Bogey is civilian.
Needs emergency fuel.</i>

1089
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,399
- Copy that.
- For flying out loud!

1090
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,085
That's all I need,
a civilian exploding on my deck.

1091
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,810
We could rig the barricade, sir.

1092
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,206
All engines, ahead flank.

1093
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,409
Aye, Captain. All engines ahead flank.

1094
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,639
<i>- Rig the barricade.</i>
- Copy that.

1095
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,166
Rig the barricade!
Chop-chop. Hubba-hubba.

1096
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,000
Let's line you up
for the barricade.

1097
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,039
All you have to do is
throttle on back and call the ball

1098
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,804
and hopefully end up in the spaghetti.

1099
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,680
What? Wait, no, wait!
Wait a second!

1100
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,842
Guys, I'm not sure I can do this.

1101
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,365
I don't see how you have a choice.

1102
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,846
Okay. But that runway is moving.

1103
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,239
We'll set you up
on the glide path.

1104
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,605
Runways are not
supposed to move.

1105
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,599
Okay. I'm okay. I'm going to be fine.

1106
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,045
- Take it easy.
- Moving runway, moving runway.

1107
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,121
- There it is. Here we go.
- Throttle on back.

1108
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,161
Maybe if I just came around again.

1109
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,289
- Level your wings.
- Easy with it.

1110
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,130
Cut, cut, cut!

1111
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,451
Stop!

1112
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,164
We've got you, Crophopper.

1113
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,600
Come on, let's get you fixed up,
refueled and back in the race.

1114
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,571
You are way behind.

1115
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,489
Thanks, guys.
You saved my tail out there.

1116
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,364
- Victory.
- Victory.

1117
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,011
Hey, what is that?

1118
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,646
That's the Jolly Wrenches
Wall of Fame.

1119
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,171
Every flyer, every mission.

1120
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,321
Mmm... Skipper... Skipper...

1121
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,323
Oh. Ha-ha! There he is.

1122
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,647
Wait. I don't understand.
Why is there only one mission?

1123
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,959
Chug, what's all that?

1124
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,839
Well, I've never been out of the country.
You know, I brought the Commodium.

1125
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,047
Whatever you do, don't drink the petrol.

1126
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,679
We're only going for two days.

1127
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,284
Got to be prepared, right?

1128
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,408
Got beachwear,
dinner wear, underwear...

1129
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,722
<i>Skipper? Come in, Skipper.</i>

1130
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,406
Dusty! We're heading off
to Mexico right now.

1131
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,879
Glad you got there safe.

1132
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,611
<i>Weather report says a major storm
is brewing out there.</i>

1133
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,570
I'm not in Mexico.
I'm with the Jolly Wrenches.

1134
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,968
You're on the <i>Flysenhower?</i>

1135
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,761
<i>Hey, I saw the Wall of Fame.
They only list one mission for you.</i>

1136
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,002
Dusty, if you're not past
that storm yet, you need...

1137
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,049
That can't be right. it must be a mistake.

1138
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,839
<i>Look, you have to get out of there.</i>

1139
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,524
<i>You're going to have to fly high.</i>

1140
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,759
Is it true?

1141
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,841
<i>Listen to me, get above the storm!</i>

1142
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,879
- Skipper, is it true?
<i>- It's true!</i>

1143
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,602
It's true.

1144
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,161
I only flew one mission.

1145
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,128
But all those stories?

1146
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,328
Crophopper,
we got weather moving in fast.

1147
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,319
You've got to take off
before it's too late.

1148
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,401
I just need a second here.

1149
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,719
That's a negative, son.

1150
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,529
You don't go now, you don't go at all.

1151
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,199
<i>Be advised, the JTWC has
issued a tropical cyclone formation alert</i>

<i>for the northeast Pacific ocean.</i>

Report to catapult two.

1157
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,683
The cat will take you from
zero to 160 knots in two seconds.

1158
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,999
Two seconds?

1159
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,839
We're going to check your weight
and set the steam pressure.

1160
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,968
Remember, climb straight ahead
once you get airborne.

1161
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,481
- Climb straight ahead.
- Get above the storm.

1162
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,686
Okay, engine full throttle.
Nod to the shooter when you're set.

1163
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,159
Go win it for the Wrenches, Dusty.

1164
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,288
<i>Volo Pro Veritas!</i>

1165
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,282
Head Wind's good. Pressure's good.

1166
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,006
Go on cat two.

1167
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,839
<i>Señor</i> Ripslinger, any comment

1168
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,444
on the disappearance
of Dusty Crophopper?

1169
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,730
Dusty was a nice guy
who flew the challenge

1170
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,042
and pierced the clouds of mediocrity.

1171
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,568
We're all going to miss him. Excuse me.

1172
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,161
Let's just hope he makes
a better boat than a plane.

1173
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,719
That's a good one, boss.

1174
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,927
Oh, yeah, that was pretty good.

1175
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:27,248
<i>Señor</i> Dusty
has 10 times the engine you do.

1176
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,004
And 10 times the integrity.

1177
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,686
Said the plane with
the shiny new propeller.

1178

How much integrity did
that one cost you, sweetheart?

1179
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,801
Too much.

1180
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,804
You used to be a great champion.

1181
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,247
How the mighty have fallen.

1182
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:50,251
You are not even worthy
of a cape swish.

1183
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,444
Really?

1184
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,919
<i>How can it be only one mission?</i>

1185
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,159
<i>The Battle of Airway.</i>

1186
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,844
<i>The raid in Tujunga Harbor.
The Aleutians.</i>

1187
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,884
<i>The Battle of Wake Island.
The Assault on Kunming.</i>

1188
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,601
I gotta get above the storm!

1189
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,201
Whoa!

1190
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,086
Mayday! Mayday! I'm going down!

1191
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,931
18 degrees north, six minutes, 119...

1192

Help!

1193
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,199
- Dusty!
<i>- Mi amigo!</i>

1194
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,770
Quick, to the hangar.

1195
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,250
Broken wing ribs,
twisted gear, bent prop,

1196
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:28,250
and your main spar is cracked bad.

1197
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,083
It's over.

1198
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,122
One mission?

1199
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,561
So much for <i>Volo Pro Veritas.</i>

1200
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,443
Can we get a minute alone, please?

1201
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,767
You, too, Sparky.

1202
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,483
My first patrol as a Jolly Wrench
was at Glendal Canal.

1203
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:09,088
My squadron was all rookies.
All razor sharp.

1204
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,727
<i>I should know.</i>

1205
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,366
<i>I trained every single one of them.</i>

1206
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,081
<i>It was supposed to be a routine patrol.
A milk run.</i>

1207
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:20,439
Look, Skipper, enemy ship
two o'clock low, two miles.

1208
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,399
- Easy pickings. What do you say?
- Negative, Jigsaw Two.

1209
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,483
Our orders are to recon
and report back.

1210
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,648
Come on, Skip, it will be a turkey shoot.

1211
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,959
- Let's do it, Skipper.
- Yeah, come on!

1212
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,122
All right. Let's go in for a closer look.

1213
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,523
But keep your distance.

1214
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,568
Holy Cow! It's the whole enemy fleet!

1215
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,285
<i>It was too late to pull up.</i>

1216
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,283
Get out of there, Lucas!

1217
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,881
<i>My whole squadron.</i>

1218
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,641
Under my command.

1219
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:35,931
After that, I just couldn't
bring myself to fly again.

1220
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,842
Let me ask you something, Dusty.

1221
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,402
If you knew the truth about my past,

1222
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,490
would you have asked me to train you?

1223
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,804
No.

1224
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,762
I'm sorry, Dusty.

1225
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,765
Dusty?

1226
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,959
Can you believe it?

1227
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,964
He hasn't been straight with me
this whole time.

1228
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,282
At least you were honest.

1229
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,647
You said I wasn't built for this.

1230
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,799
I guess I should
have listened to you.

1231
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:36,601
Dusty, if you had listened to me
I would never ever forgive myself.

1232
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,566
Look, the Skipper may have
been wrong for what he did,

1233
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,163
but he was right about you.

1234
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:47,443
You're not a crop duster. You're a racer.

1235
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,886
And now

1236
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,010
the whole world knows it.

1237
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,008
Thanks, Dottie.

1238
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,368
That means a lot.

1239
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:11,328
I've gone as far as I can go.
I'm busted up, look at me.

1240
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,727
Yes, look at you.

1241
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,291
Dusty, I cannot bear the thought
of competing without you.

1242
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,081
Hey, that's the wing
of a T-33 Shooting Star.

1243
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,164
When the great Mexican Air Force
needed help,

1244
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:35,729
American T-33s came.
They did not ask questions.

1245
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,804
They did not hesitate. They were there.

1246
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,248
Because that is what <i>compadres</i> do.

1247
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,526
And what's that?

1248
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,290
That is my lunch. Don't touch.

1249
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,171
But the wings are yours.

1250
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,283
El Chu, I really appreciate...

1251
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,521
<i>Silencio.</i>

1252
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:55,691
After all, you helped me
with my pursuits of the heart.

1253
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,490
Now we are here to help you.

1254
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,851
- We?
<i>- Oui.</i>

1255
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:06,251
Good luck tomorrow, Dusty.
I am so proud to compete with you.

1256
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,450
You're a good egg, Dusty.
Look, here's a sat-nav device.

1257
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,886
Just in case...

1258
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,447
In case you ever find yourself
lost, you know, without a...

1259
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,650
Without a friend to help you through it.

1260
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,366
Thank you, Bulldog.

1261
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,330
Here's a flow control valve for you.

1262
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,451
How about a starter generator?

1263
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,086
It is honor to fly beside you.

1264
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,640
Thanks, everyone. Really.

1265
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,688
This is fantastic.

1266
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,080
Looks like all you need now is a...

1267
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,605
A new propeller?

1268
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,491
How about a Sky Slycer Mark Five?

1269
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:46,002
Wait, that's your propeller.
You could still win the race.

1270
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,648
Oh, I intend to, but with my old propeller.

1271
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,849
This one didn't really suit me.

1272
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,522
But I think you
will have a lot better luck with it.

1273
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,930
Thanks, Ishani.

1274
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,479
Dottie, can you fix me?

1275
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:05,280
Does a PT6A
have a multi-stage compressor?

1276
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,051
Uh...

1277
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,929
Yes! Yes it does.

1278
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,566
All right, you guys,
let's get him ready to race.

1279
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,920
<i>This one's...</i>

1280
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,041
What?

1281
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,801
Hmm.

1282
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:39,562
<i>We are live from Mexico.
And here they come.</i>

1283
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,924
This is it, race fans.
The final leg back to New York.

1284
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,201
Whoa, dude!

1285
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,839
- We'll see you in New York.
- Thanks, guys.

1286
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,325
It's dustin' time!

1287
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,851
Dusty <i>la vista,</i> baby!

1288
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,651
You gotta hand it to him.
He never gives up.

1289
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,689
Come on, Chug,
we have a jet to catch.

1290
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,844
New York City.
Finish line, here we come!

1291
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,162
Hey. So are you ready to go, Skip?

1292
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,799
Probably best if I don't.

1293
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,801
What...

1294
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,519
Oh. Okay.

1295
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,522
Are you sure?

1296
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,204
Yeah.

1297
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,009
- Dusty!
- He's back.

1298
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,207
You got to be kidding me.

1299
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,209
- Who's that guy?
- It's the crop duster.

1300
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,039
- Another one?
- It's the same one, Knucklehead.

1301
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,246
Move aside, idiots.

1302
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,919
Bolting on a few new parts
doesn't change who you are.

1303
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,526
I can still
smell the farm on you.

1304
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,090
You know what? I finally get it.

1305
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:04,211
You're afraid of
getting beat by a crop duster.

1306
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:09,250
Well, check six, because I'm coming.

1307
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,931
And what are you punks looking at?

1308
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,570
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Sorry.

1309
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,890
We are going to end this,
once and for all.

1310
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,239
- Yeah, man.
- This is going to be fun.

1311
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,399
<i>This one's all about speed
and the willingness to give it all.</i>

1312
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:35,247
<i>First to cut the ribbon in New York
takes home the trophy and the glory.</i>

1313
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,841
Ya!

1314
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,726
<i>And we're off
as the first flyers take to the air.</i>

1315
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,287
I will wait for you
at the finish line, <i>hermosa.</i>

1316
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,011
No, no, no. I will be waiting for you.

1317
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,529
Ya!

1318
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,647
<i>The rest of the field
is now off and running.</i>

1319
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,121
<i>And though Crophopper did not
complete the previous leg,</i>

1320
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,489
<i>race officials ruled his radio
had been tampered with.</i>

1321
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,880
<i>So he'll be allowed to compete.</i>

1322
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,681
<i>But with a severe time penalty.</i>

1323
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,326
<i>I've never seen someone come
back from this far behind.</i>

1324
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,039
<i>It's going to take both
horsepower and willpower</i>

1325
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,280
<i>to even have a chance.</i>

1326
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,162
Good show, Dusty.

1327
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,522
- Um, boss?
- What?

1328
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,041
He's here.

1329
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,083
Okay, we're out of camera range.

1330
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,009
You know what to do.

1331
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,847
Hey, farmer.
Time to plow the fields.

1332
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,999
Looks like you've run out of airspace,
Crophopper.

1333
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,127
Hey!

1334
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,920
- Skipper? Whoa!
<i>- Dusty, pull up!</i>

1335
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,368
Skipper? You're flying!

1336
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,521
<i>Oh, you noticed.</i>

1337
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,919
<i>Listen, I got Rip.
You take care of the other two.</i>

1338
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,921
Got it.

1339
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,441
They're on your six, kid.
You gotta lose them.

1340
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,886
I'm trying.

1341
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,770
Skip, I can't shake them.

1342
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,122
Pull hard right.
I'll break left and take out Rip.

1343
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,527
- Use the rocks.
- Roger that!

1344
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1345
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,286
Yeah!

1346
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,767
Oh, that's going to
leave a mark.

1347
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,245
What?

1348
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,651
Say hello to the Warsaw Windmill.

1349
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,007
Whoa! You're crazy!
That's right.

1350
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,967
- Dusty! Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1351
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,003
That was pretty good for a crop duster.

1352
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:56,768
And not bad for
an old-timer who doesn't fly.

1353
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,642
Oh, yeah? Well, I may be old,
but at least I ain't afraid of heights.

1354
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,165
Oh, okay.

1355
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,721
No!

1356
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,450
That's why they call them Sky Slycers!

1357
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,049
Oh, no. Skipper, are you okay?

1358
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,844
Are you kidding?
I'm great.

1359
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,239
- But what about your tail?
- I'll live. Go get them!

1360
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,730
Go!

1361
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,210
<i>We're closing in
on the final stretch, folks.</i>

1362
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,839
<i>That's right, Colin.</i>

1363
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,800
<i>And ever since they emerged
from Deadstick Desert,</i>

1364
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,482
<i>Ripslinger has maintained a lead.</i>

1365
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,531
Any sign of them?

1366
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,201
Nothing yet.

1367
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,201
- What?
- Hi.

1368
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,485
Come on, come on, come on.

1369
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,005
Not now! Not now!

1370
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,770
Come on, come on, come on.

1371
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,450
No!

1372
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:25,200
<i>Tailwinds like
nothing you've ever flown.</i>

1373
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,730
Roger that, Skip.

1374
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:38,206
Don't look down. Don't look down.

1375
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,570
Oh, yeah!

1376
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,283
Okay, time to eat my dust.

1377
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,400
With another win for Ripslinger
seeming inevitable...

1378
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,159
Wait a second, it's Dusty Crophopper!

1379
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,810
- Yes!
- Go!

1380
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,483
<i>And here they come,
down the stretch.</i>

1381
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,049
<i>It's going to be close,
it's anyone's race.</i>

1382
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,607
All right, get my good side, fellas.

1383
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,001
What?

1384
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,009
Yes!

1385
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,322
<i>He's done it! He's done it.</i>

1386
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,489
Crophopper!

1387
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,920
No!

1388
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,241
What?

1389
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,683
<i>From last to first.</i>

1390
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,410
<i>From obscurity to immortality,</i>

1391
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:15,039
<i>the racing world
will never forget this day.</i>

1392
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,959
<i>For the first time, a crop duster</i>

1393
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,008
<i>has won the
Wings Around the Globe Rally!</i>

1394
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,850
Yes, Dusty! Ha-ha!

1395
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,801
<i>Magnifique, Dusty!</i>

1396
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,361
You really kicked his bottom, lad!

1397
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,527
All right. Yeah! Now that's how to pass!

1398
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,761
You did it!

1399
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,649
I couldn't have done it
without you, Dottie.

1400
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,002
Yeah, I know.

1401
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,682
Hey, buddy, great tip about Ripslinger
leaning to the cameras. Thanks, Chug.

1402
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,609
Hey, anything for my pal.

1403
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:49,203
Well done, Dusty.
The world has a new champion.

1404
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,850
And so do I.

1405
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,771
Thanks, Ishani. For everything.

1406
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,879
<i>- Herr Dusty!</i>
- Franz?

1407
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,199
- Hoorah!
- What are you doing here?

1408
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,046
We came to watch you win the race.
You are an inspiration to all of us.

1409
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,287
"All of us"?

1410
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:07,201
Yeah. All of us who want to do more
than just what we were built for.

1411
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,967
Whoa! Thanks, guys!

1412
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,201
Whoo-wee!

1413
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,688
Ripstinker. Yeah, that's your name.
That's some supersonic sewer sauce.

1414
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,840
Man, I thought
Vita-stink-a-bunch was bad.

1415
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,809
That's got nothing on you.

1416
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,686
Ooh! You're just nasty. Nastilicious.

1417
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,564
You need to go home and wash up.

1418
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,131
Twice.

1419
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,599
Whoa!

1420
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,568
Who's that guy?

1421
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,886
Thanks, Skip.

1422
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,161
Don't thank me.

1423
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:08,284
I learned a lot more from you
than you ever learned from me.

1424
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,245
Attention on deck. Victory!

1425
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,486
Victory!

1426
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,121
It's an honor to be here.

1427
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,241
Hook them up.

1428
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,170
- You ready, wingman?
- Roger that.

1429
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,366
An honorary Jolly Wrench.
How's that feel, Dusty?

1430
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,521
It feels great!

1431
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,200
Back in the saddle again,
eh, Skipper?

1432
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,199
Well, they didn't have these fancy toys
the last time I did this.

1433
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,519
Nothing to it.

1434
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,000
They hook you up,
you nod to the shooter over there,

1435
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,247
and hang on!

1436
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,524
Yeah!

1437
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,439
Last one back to Propwash buys!

1438
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,839
Ha-ha! You're on!

1438
01:22:40,305 --> 01:23:40,511
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
