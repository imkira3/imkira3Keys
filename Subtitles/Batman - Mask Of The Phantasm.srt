2
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,866
This has been a long time coming, fellas.

3
00:01:58,038 --> 00:01:59,912
Three years on the plates alone.

4
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:03,202
But I think you'll find the product
was worth the wait. Go ahead.

5
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:04,788
Take a good look, boys.

6
00:02:06,422 --> 00:02:08,913
Jeez, Mr. Sol, I can't tell the difference.

7
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,339
You'd need one of them
neutron microscopes, Palmer.

8
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,752
It's identical,
down to Ben Franklin's stubble.

9
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:17,554
I want it laundered at a half mil a week.
Three-quarter mil by March.

10
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:20,050
Anybody got a problem with that?

11
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:22,847
The Bat!

12
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:25,732
Get him!

13
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:06,973
Chuckie Sol.

14
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:09,646
Batman! How did you get here?

15
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:18,446
Your angel of death awaits.

16
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:20,285
You ain't the Bat!

17
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:26,749
Who... Who are you? What do you want?

18
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,039
I want you, Chuckie boy.

19
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:15,165
This time I got you, you lousy, stinking...

20
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:16,962
What...

21
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:35,314
- Look at that!
- Good Lord!

22
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:38,275
- What happened?
- Look! It's Batman!

23
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,022
- Up there!
- Oh, my God.

24
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:03,756
I'm telling you, friends,
it's vigilantism at its deadliest.

25
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:07,723
How many times are we gonna
let Batman cross the line?

26
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:12,047
I'm sorry, councilman, but you can't blame
Batman for what happened to Chuckie Sol.

27
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:14,816
Why not? He's a loose cannon, commissioner.

28
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:18,977
It's not just my opinion. A lot of people,
including the police, I might add...

29
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:21,903
...think Batman's as unstable
as the crooks he brings in.

30
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:24,033
What kind of city are we running...

31
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:28,616
...when we depend on the support
of a potential madman?

32
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:34,077
Such rot, sir.
Why, you're the very model of sanity.

33
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:38,753
Oh, by the way, I pressed your tights
and put away your exploding gas balls.

34
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:41,084
Thank you, Alfred.

35
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:44,301
Might one inquire what this is?

36
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:48,969
A piece of windshield from Chuckie Sol's car.

37
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:52,978
There's a chemical residue on it.

38
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:56,233
Some kind of dense, long-chain
macromolecular polymer.

39
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:57,860
Adaptogenic, of course.

40
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:00,105
Of course.

41
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,698
I should be landing any minute.

42
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:08,367
- It'll be good to see you again, Arthur.
- <i>You too.</i>

43
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,530
And don't worry about a thing.
We'll clear up these old family finances.

44
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:16,370
Don't forget, you've got a bigtime
city councilman on your side.

45
00:06:16,588 --> 00:06:18,830
I can't believe it's been 10 years.

46
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:22,254
<i>Thinking of looking up some old friends?</i>

47
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:27,759
Oh, Arthur, don't start that again.
He's ancient history.

48
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,718
That's encouraging. I'll see you soon.

49
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:52,995
Oh, come on, Bruce.
All alone in this big mansion.

50
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:56,666
Haven't you ever thought
about marriage, even once?

51
00:06:56,837 --> 00:06:59,410
Oh, never say the M word in front of Bruce.

52
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,214
It makes him nervous.

53
00:07:01,383 --> 00:07:03,257
What about the I word?

54
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,705
- The I word?
- "Ingagement."

55
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:09,796
I'd watch out for Brucie
if I were you, girls.

56
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:12,011
First he wines and dines you...

57
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:15,519
...makes you think you're the only
woman he's ever been interested in.

58
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:18,975
And just when you're wondering
where to register the china...

59
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:21,060
...he forgets your phone number.

60
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:24,814
That's Bruce Wayne's style.

61
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:27,730
- Bruce?
- Excuse me.

62
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,902
Oh, God. It's awful.

63
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,407
Bruce? Bruce?

64
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,415
- A friend in need?
- Councilman.

65
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,581
- So how goes the Bat bashing?
- Better than your love life.

66
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:43,336
It's almost as if you pick them because you
know there's no chance for a relationship.

67
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,135
At least since that one girl.
What was her name? Anne? Andi?

68
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:53,382
Andrea? Yes! Andrea Beaumont.
Now, there was a sweet number.

69
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,304
How did you let her get loose?

70
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:00,437
Thanks for the handkerchief, Arthur.
You know where you can stick it.

71
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,782
<i>Andrea.</i>

72
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:44,646
That's right. And if Daddy
gets any more protective...

73
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,856
...he's going to build a moat
around my bedroom.

74
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:51,531
Oh, it's times like this
I wish you were around to...

75
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:53,736
- Yes?
- Excuse me.

76
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:56,783
I thought you were saying something.
Well, to me, I mean.

77
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:58,286
No.

78
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:01,291
Okay.

79
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:07,589
Know who that was? Bruce Wayne.
You know, Wayne Enterprises.

80
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,338
I've seen him on campus. Very moody.
Cute, though.

81
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:14,922
- Yes?
- I heard my name. I thought...

82
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,926
- Who are you talking to?
- My mother.

83
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:23,769
- Oh, well, I didn't mean to...
- That's okay. We're done.

84
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:26,813
Mom doesn't have much to say today.

85
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,113
I'm not the only one who talks
to their loved ones, you know.

86
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:32,405
I didn't say anything.

87
00:09:36,914 --> 00:09:41,492
It's just that when I talk to her out loud,
I can imagine how she'd reply.

88
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,917
I can hear her, like she's right there.

89
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:46,498
I've talked to my parents.

90
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:49,385
- What did you say?
- I made a vow.

91
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:51,674
- What vow?
- A secret one.

92
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,550
Ooh, a man of mystery.

93
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:56,846
Have you kept your vow?

94
00:09:57,393 --> 00:09:58,851
So far.

95
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:06,102
- Andrea Beaumont.
- Bruce Wayne.

96
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:10,398
I know. The boy billionaire. So tell me,
with all that money and power...

97
00:10:10,572 --> 00:10:13,443
...how come you always look like
you wanna jump off a cliff?

98
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:16,369
- Why should you care?
- I don't.

99
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:20,572
Mother was asking.

100
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:47,273
Let's step on it. We ain't got all night.

101
00:10:51,697 --> 00:10:53,773
Wait for me!

102
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:59,160
- Coming through.
- Okay, Skaz. We're done shopping.

103
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:00,944
All clear here.

104
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,374
Well, Bruce, here goes.

105
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:07,291
Let's blow this pop stand.

106
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:13,466
On your stomachs, arms spread!

107
00:11:13,677 --> 00:11:15,717
- Who's this clown?
- You heard me!

108
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:18,302
Yeah, you heard him, boys.

109
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:22,264
- You heard Mr. Kung Fu.
- Yeah, I'm shaking.

110
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:24,345
Say your prayers, sucker!

111
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:47,031
Yes!

112
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:56,878
Excuse me.

113
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:29,041
Hey, Jonesy. There!

114
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:05,886
I read about your anonymous exploits
this morning, and I must say...

115
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,935
...are you sure you won't reconsider rugby?

116
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:12,057
Sorry, Alfred, but the plan is working.

117
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:14,686
I had the edge. I could feel it.

118
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:18,442
There was only one thing wrong:
They weren't afraid of me.

119
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:20,777
I must strike fear in them from the start.

120
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,774
Pardon, Master Bruce, but we may want
to postpone the shoptalk, as it were.

121
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,070
I believe you have a visitor.

122
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:31,748
Hi. Hey, what happened to you?
Trip over some loose cash?

123
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:34,580
It's been three days since we met,
and still no calls.

124
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:36,829
I figured you must be dead or something.

125
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:39,419
You expect every guy you meet to call you up?

126
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,003
The ones that are smart enough
to dial a phone.

127
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:45,171
- What is that?
- Jujitsu.

128
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:47,180
Gesundheit.

129
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:50,513
- That was a joke.
- Jujitsu is no joke.

130
00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:52,637
It takes years to master.

131
00:14:52,813 --> 00:14:54,391
Hey!

132
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,771
Got a few moves of my own.

133
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:02,236
Miss Hovey's self-defense class for girls.

134
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:05,115
He laughs.

135
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:14,120
Nice footwork. Can you dance too?

136
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,758
Oh.

137
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:37,186
Pardon, sir, but Miss Bambi
is dancing on the piano.

138
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:41,023
Brucie! Where are you?

139
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:14,058
- You guys wait here.
- Whatever you say, Mr. Bronski.

140
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:22,644
- They say the Bat iced this guy.
- I know.

141
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,703
Tut, tut. Chuckie, Chuckie.

142
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,416
You always were a loser.

143
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:42,129
- Buzz.
- Huh?

144
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:43,999
Who's there?

145
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:59,303
Buzz Bronski. Your angel of death awaits.

146
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:02,061
Get away from me, you freak!

147
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:29,586
Time to pay for your sins, Mr. Bronski.

148
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:41,269
Buzz.

149
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:46,023
All right, creep. Catch this!

150
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,237
What the...

151
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:55,112
Dave! Dougan!

152
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,865
Boys!

153
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:58,741
Come on!

154
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:03,835
He was up here!

155
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:06,626
- Boss? Boss! Boss!
- Boss! Boss!

156
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:11,168
Boys! Hurry!

157
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,112
You always were a loser, Mr. Bronski.

158
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:38,368
Farewell, Mr. Bronski.

159
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:56,634
- Boss!
- Boss!

160
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:03,393
Oh, man.

161
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,733
Hey!

162
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:09,691
It's the Bat!

163
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:14,824
It's the stinking Bat!

164
00:19:32,968 --> 00:19:34,628
Buzz!

165
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:40,432
No!

166
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,737
What do you mean, you won't?
You have to go after him.

167
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:03,070
He didn't do it. It's garbage, Mr. Reeves.
The Batman does not kill. Period.

168
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:07,834
You want him, you get him.
I'll have no part of it.

169
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,663
Well, gentlemen?

170
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:13,880
Any ideas?

171
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:23,883
Hm. He's usually here by now.

172
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,524
There appears to be some
chemical residue on the lawn.

173
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:41,908
Could match the traces I found on the glass.

174
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,863
Not much, but it's been that kind of day.

175
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,895
You'd think they could afford a weed-eater.

176
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:14,142
Sorry, Mom, but the whole world's
going to seed.

177
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,907
You.

178
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,627
Bruce?

179
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:42,718
So I'm having the banker
cut through some red tape.

180
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,140
Says he can roll your money
into a higher-yield account.

181
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,477
- Amount? What amount?
- I said, account.

182
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:52,932
Oh, I'm sorry, I was just reminiscing.

183
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:56,188
Hey, that's okay.
You must have a lot on your mind.

184
00:21:56,362 --> 00:21:57,642
<i>Monsieur?</i>

185
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:09,407
- Remember this place?
- Sure.

186
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,370
You, me and Daddy
used to come here all the time.

187
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:15,421
How is the old guy?
You're still close, aren't you?

188
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:19,172
- Closer than ever.
- I'm sorry he couldn't make it this time...

189
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:23,804
...but then, I've always wished
I could have some time alone with you.

190
00:22:24,848 --> 00:22:27,600
Well, who knows what the future might bring.

191
00:22:44,743 --> 00:22:48,990
<i>Welcome to Gotham World's Fair,
a dream of the future.</i>

192
00:22:49,164 --> 00:22:53,992
<i>A bright tomorrow filled with hope
and promise for all mankind.</i>

193
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:57,254
<i>This is a vision of a shimmering utopia...</i>

194
00:22:57,464 --> 00:23:01,379
<i>...where we shall all spend
the rest of our lives.</i>

195
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:40,047
Do you think we'll really see
any of this in our lifetime?

196
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:42,007
Oh...

197
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:48,348
Bruce?

198
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:51,220
- Bruce, I'm talking to you.
- Huh?

199
00:23:51,393 --> 00:23:54,762
Oh, I'm sorry, Andi.
My mind was on something else.

200
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:58,604
- Like what?
- Oh, just, you know, the future.

201
00:23:58,942 --> 00:24:02,358
Anyone's in particular,
or just the generic brand?

202
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:05,147
- Well, you know.
- No, I don't.

203
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:07,897
Since when do you talk to me
about your plans?

204
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:11,031
By the way, Dad's been wanting to meet you.

205
00:24:11,205 --> 00:24:14,289
- Oh, yeah?
- But I told him you're not up to it yet.

206
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,287
- Oh, I can meet him.
- Great!

207
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:19,709
I'll call him right now.

208
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:25,668
- You sure about this?
- Sure I'm sure.

209
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:28,845
What the heck am I doing, Alfred?
This isn't part of the plan.

210
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:30,680
I must be going nuts.

211
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:35,636
If I may make so bold, Master Bruce,
I'd say quite the reverse.

212
00:24:36,438 --> 00:24:37,897
Excuse me, Mr. Beaumont.

213
00:24:38,065 --> 00:24:41,564
Here are the partnership papers.
If you could just go over them, sir.

214
00:24:42,236 --> 00:24:43,813
Knock, knock.

215
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:45,737
Andi.

216
00:24:45,948 --> 00:24:48,902
Well, this is a most pleasant interruption.

217
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:51,525
At last I meet the elusive Bruce Wayne.

218
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:55,571
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Sir? Oh, don't be so formal, Bruce.

219
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:58,994
Andrea's told me so much,
I feel like we're practically family.

220
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:01,292
Daddy.

221
00:25:01,463 --> 00:25:04,832
- Don't mind me, I was just leaving.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

222
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:08,508
This is Arthur Reeves, one of the
Young Turks from my legal department.

223
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:10,339
He's someone you should get to know.

224
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:21,108
- I hope we're not interrupting anything.
- Not at all.

225
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:24,062
I'm never too busy for my Andi
and her friends.

226
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:27,279
I tell you, Bruce,
I do a lot of financial planning.

227
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:30,402
When it comes to money,
you can't take the future for granted.

228
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:34,782
But money means little if you
don't have loved ones to share it with.

229
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:37,244
Nothing's more important than family.

230
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,416
- Yes, Mr. Beaumont.
- Carl.

231
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:43,001
Excuse me, sir, but there's
a Mr. Valestra here to see you.

232
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:45,669
He says he has an appointment.

233
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:51,509
If Mr. Valestra says he has an appointment,
then Mr. Valestra has an appointment.

234
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:57,808
That's what I like about your pop,
kiddo. He knows his priorities.

235
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:09,523
Is my shirt too big,
or is that my flesh crawling?

236
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,026
Well, Mr. Valestra is not
what you'd call a people person.

237
00:26:13,243 --> 00:26:14,868
- No kidding.
- Come on, Bruce.

238
00:26:15,037 --> 00:26:17,742
That's just Daddy's business.
He deals with everyone.

239
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:21,857
It's not your father, Andi, it's...
It's everything!

240
00:26:24,838 --> 00:26:28,290
I said, hand over the cash box, man.

241
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:33,715
Uh-huh.

242
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:38,258
Give me! Hey, Eddie,
pops here needs some persuasion.

243
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:40,642
- No, don't hurt me!
- Stay here.

244
00:26:40,813 --> 00:26:43,386
- I gotta stop this.
- Bruce, no, don't.

245
00:26:43,565 --> 00:26:45,439
What do you expect me to do, stand here?

246
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:49,774
Just come back to me in one piece. Please.

247
00:26:52,366 --> 00:26:54,405
There you go!

248
00:26:54,994 --> 00:26:56,488
Hey!

249
00:27:04,712 --> 00:27:07,997
Better have your insurance paid up, sucker.

250
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:45,958
Here you go!

251
00:28:00,643 --> 00:28:04,474
Come on! Pick up the box! Pick up the box!

252
00:28:09,985 --> 00:28:12,737
Oh, thank God you're all right.
I was so frightened.

253
00:28:12,946 --> 00:28:17,490
- Come on, let me have a look at you.
- Andrea, please.

254
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:33,257
What am I still doing this for?

255
00:28:41,183 --> 00:28:44,634
It's gotta be one or the other.
I can't have it both ways.

256
00:28:44,812 --> 00:28:48,394
I can't put myself on the line if there's
someone waiting for me at home.

257
00:28:48,565 --> 00:28:51,851
Miss Beaumont would be glad to know
you feel that way, Master Bruce.

258
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:54,814
She's holding on line one, sir.

259
00:28:58,617 --> 00:28:59,993
Master Bruce?

260
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:02,652
Alfred, I can't. Not now.

261
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:07,664
- Well, what shall I say, sir?
- I don't know.

262
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:10,077
I just don't know!

263
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:19,049
It doesn't mean I don't care anymore.

264
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:21,973
I don't wanna let you down, honest, but...

265
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:26,435
But it just doesn't hurt so bad anymore.

266
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:28,430
You can understand that, can't you?

267
00:29:28,605 --> 00:29:31,690
Look, I can give money to the city,
they can hire more cops.

268
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:35,394
Let someone else take the risk.
It's different now.

269
00:29:40,784 --> 00:29:45,031
Please. I need it to be different now.

270
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,127
I know I made a promise,
but I didn't see this coming.

271
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:55,083
I didn't count on being happy.

272
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,262
Please.

273
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,838
Tell me that it's okay.

274
00:30:04,016 --> 00:30:06,471
Maybe they already have.

275
00:30:10,564 --> 00:30:13,020
Maybe they sent me.

276
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:44,971
Hey!

277
00:30:45,516 --> 00:30:47,176
Get in.

278
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:55,603
All I wanna know is, is it true?

279
00:30:55,818 --> 00:31:00,610
- Is the Batman really hitting our people?
- We have eyewitnesses.

280
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:04,026
Beautiful. That's just beautiful.

281
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:08,993
Why? He never leaned on us before.
I'm too old for this.

282
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:11,578
I suppose you could demand police protection.

283
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:16,086
What are you, a comedian? This is
the Batman we're talking about here.

284
00:31:16,255 --> 00:31:19,873
A freak job! He'll crucify me!

285
00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:32,560
Pull over.

286
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:36,524
It's not very healthy in here.

287
00:31:42,906 --> 00:31:46,690
O'Neil Funding Corporation.
Adam's Tool and Die.

288
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,114
- Oh, I should have known.
- Sir?

289
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:53,622
Chuckie Sol and Buzz Bronski.
They have some history together.

290
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:57,541
They were partners in dummy
corporations set up over 10 years ago.

291
00:31:57,713 --> 00:32:02,624
The third director was
one Salvatore Valestra.

292
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:08,546
Hm. Sal's having company tonight.
Don't wait up.

293
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:13,019
Meaning, I trust, that once you're
done with him, you'll be seeing her?

294
00:32:13,228 --> 00:32:16,064
You think you know everything
about me, don't you?

295
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:21,350
I diapered your bottom.
I bloody well ought to, sir.

296
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:24,818
Well, you're wrong.

297
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,854
Andrea's father.

298
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:06,114
You know how much I've always
wanted to see Europe, Bruce...

299
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:08,155
...and Dad has business there next week.

300
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:11,160
It's some sort of hush-hush deal.
He won't tell me a thing.

301
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:13,327
He can't even say when we'd be back.

302
00:33:13,622 --> 00:33:16,030
Will you at least let me try
to talk you out of it?

303
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:19,791
- Bruce.
- Wait, please.

304
00:33:21,755 --> 00:33:23,878
Oh, never mind.

305
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:25,591
I'm no good at this.

306
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:30,758
Here. You'll get the idea.

307
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:38,763
What do you say?

308
00:33:40,232 --> 00:33:43,683
Of course I will.
I never thought this would happen.

309
00:33:43,902 --> 00:33:47,188
I always felt like
I'd thrown you a curve ball.

310
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:50,692
Like you never knew what to do
with me, because I wasn't in the plan.

311
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:54,029
You are now. I'm changing the plan.

312
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:20,221
Uh-oh. Looks like Dad's got company.
Business-type company.

313
00:34:20,564 --> 00:34:24,514
He doesn't usually see clients here.
At least, not at this hour.

314
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,234
Maybe we should wait till tomorrow
to give him the good news.

315
00:34:31,408 --> 00:34:33,531
- Maybe.
- Good night, Bruce.

316
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:36,407
- Alfred.
- Miss.

317
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,971
It's another cave, all right.

318
00:34:57,476 --> 00:35:01,343
Could be as big as the house, judging
from all the bats that came out of it.

319
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:05,733
- Alfred, what's wrong?
- This just arrived, sir.

320
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:16,242
"Left with Dad."

321
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:19,531
"Too young"? "Need time"?

322
00:35:19,707 --> 00:35:21,249
"Forget about me."

323
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:12,335
My God.

324
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:49,544
If there was just some other way.

325
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:19,444
I hate that song.

326
00:37:19,618 --> 00:37:22,240
Gasp! Can it be?

327
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:26,113
Old Sallie "The Wheezer" Valestra.

328
00:37:27,293 --> 00:37:29,700
Welcome, paisan.

329
00:37:29,878 --> 00:37:32,251
It's been a dog's age.

330
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:35,792
Hello, Joker. Didn't mean
to drop by unannounced.

331
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:39,918
Oh, Salvatore. Why so formal?

332
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:49,679
So, what's an old-timer like you
want with a two-timer like me?

333
00:37:49,857 --> 00:37:52,015
Business. I got...

334
00:37:52,192 --> 00:37:54,434
Business! Sounds like fun.

335
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:58,111
Come. We'll repair to more
comfortable environs.

336
00:37:58,282 --> 00:38:01,817
Now, hold on to your hat
and watch those valuables.

337
00:38:01,994 --> 00:38:04,699
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

338
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:24,930
Honey, I'm home.

339
00:38:29,104 --> 00:38:31,393
Oh, don't mind my home-security system.

340
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:34,021
Down, Rusty.

341
00:38:35,277 --> 00:38:40,023
Can't be too careful,
with all those weirdos around.

342
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:45,359
What? Meat loaf again?

343
00:38:45,537 --> 00:38:48,159
Oh, I had it for lunch.

344
00:38:48,332 --> 00:38:50,574
Isn't Hazel here a cutie?

345
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:55,585
True, she's a real homebody, but you
can't help who you fall in love with.

346
00:38:57,257 --> 00:39:01,172
Come. Have a seat, Sal.

347
00:39:01,512 --> 00:39:05,094
Tell me what's on your so-called mind.

348
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:08,266
It's Batman. He's gone nuts.

349
00:39:08,435 --> 00:39:11,685
First he whacked Chuckie Sol, then Buzz...

350
00:39:11,855 --> 00:39:13,350
...and now he's after me.

351
00:39:13,524 --> 00:39:18,766
I've been reading lately how old Guano
Man is wound tight enough to snap.

352
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:23,691
Wouldn't it be great if I'd finally
driven him off the deep end?

353
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:25,196
This isn't a joke.

354
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:28,370
Batman's knocking us off.
You're the only one who can take him.

355
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:32,406
Look, 5 million up front with whatever
you want to finish him off.

356
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:38,546
What do I look like, pest control?

357
00:39:38,716 --> 00:39:42,416
Think, you fool. Once he gets me,
how long till he gets you?

358
00:39:42,594 --> 00:39:47,387
You know what I'm talking about.
Your hands are just as dirty.

359
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,177
Dirtier.

360
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:54,814
Don't touch me, old man.
I don't know where you've been.

361
00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:58,682
Oh, Sal, no one could take a joke like you.

362
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:01,482
- Of course I'll help you out.
- Really?

363
00:40:03,115 --> 00:40:07,694
No way is anybody gonna hurt my pal Sal.

364
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,239
That's it. That's what I want to see.

365
00:40:11,415 --> 00:40:15,413
A nice big smile.

366
00:40:16,337 --> 00:40:19,254
- Thanks for another lovely dinner.
- My pleasure.

367
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,216
You know, it's not good
to go to bed on a full stomach.

368
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:27,340
We could stay up, talk for a while.

369
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:32,639
Oh, Artie, I've got a killer day
tomorrow. But call me, okay?

370
00:40:35,272 --> 00:40:38,190
- Good night.
- Good night.

371
00:40:43,572 --> 00:40:47,866
Hmph. So we meet again. I like the cape.

372
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:50,656
Not sure about the mask, though.

373
00:40:51,497 --> 00:40:52,872
Have you ever seen this?

374
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,788
- No.
- But that's your father.

375
00:40:57,962 --> 00:41:00,453
He's the one who set up
their corporate partnership.

376
00:41:00,631 --> 00:41:02,173
So? That's his job.

377
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:05,711
He was the one element
that tied these gangsters together.

378
00:41:05,886 --> 00:41:08,045
- Where's your father now?
- Haven't a clue.

379
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:11,840
- Why don't you try Madagascar.
- That's not what you told Reeves.

380
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:14,473
You told him you were
closer than ever to your father.

381
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:17,432
- You had me bugged, is that it?
- I can read lips.

382
00:41:17,606 --> 00:41:20,311
Then read them now: Get out.

383
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,987
You still following your dad's orders?

384
00:41:27,157 --> 00:41:32,115
The way I see it, the only one in this
room controlled by his parents is you.

385
00:42:22,087 --> 00:42:26,833
Sal Valestra. Your angel of death awaits.

386
00:42:33,223 --> 00:42:37,221
<i>Guess the joke is on me.
You're not Batman after all.</i>

387
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:39,517
<i>Looks like there's a new face in Gotham.</i>

388
00:42:39,688 --> 00:42:42,855
<i>And soon his name will be all over town.</i>

389
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:48,695
<i>To say nothing of his legs and feet
and spleen and head.</i>

390
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:40,866
Stay away. This is not your fight.

391
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:45,709
This madness ends now.

392
00:43:57,766 --> 00:44:01,135
Batman, this is the police.
You are under arrest.

393
00:44:01,312 --> 00:44:03,019
Step away from the edge of the roof.

394
00:44:03,188 --> 00:44:07,815
Put your hands on top of your head
and stay in the light.

395
00:44:07,985 --> 00:44:09,693
Stay on him.

396
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:15,155
Alpha 63 in pursuit, subject
moving north along Denny Drive.

397
00:44:15,326 --> 00:44:16,903
<i>All units, approach with caution.</i>

398
00:44:17,077 --> 00:44:19,366
<i>Subject is considered armed and dangerous.</i>

399
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:21,531
<i>Use of deadly force is authorized.</i>

400
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,840
Take it down. I gotta get closer.

401
00:44:44,229 --> 00:44:46,021
Freeze!

402
00:44:54,949 --> 00:44:57,274
He's heading for the construction site!

403
00:44:57,493 --> 00:44:59,818
<i>SWAT deployment teams, move into position.</i>

404
00:44:59,995 --> 00:45:01,739
<i>All units, acknowledge.</i>

405
00:45:01,914 --> 00:45:03,990
Roger that, Charlie 3. Moving into position.

406
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:06,574
Come on, let's go. Let's move.

407
00:45:16,762 --> 00:45:19,882
<i>All available units to Fourth
and Madison, the construction site.</i>

408
00:45:20,057 --> 00:45:21,848
<i>Charlie 3. Prepare for tear gas.</i>

409
00:45:29,775 --> 00:45:31,150
There he is, man.

410
00:45:35,698 --> 00:45:37,322
Hey, wait!

411
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,620
You jerk!

412
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:47,749
Get a light up there.

413
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:09,023
Delta 3 to ground. He's down. We have him.

414
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,863
Fire.

415
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:31,918
- Quick, around the back.
- Come on.

416
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:37,208
Come on, you grunts.

417
00:46:57,613 --> 00:47:00,151
- Andrea.
- Hurry.

418
00:47:03,202 --> 00:47:04,993
Who's that?

419
00:47:14,838 --> 00:47:18,373
There are certain advantages to having
a sturdy cranium, Master Bruce.

420
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:22,383
But then, hardheadedness
was always your virtue.

421
00:47:22,554 --> 00:47:26,255
Well, I'm sure I have things to do elsewhere.

422
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:30,431
You have an excellent sense of timing.

423
00:47:30,604 --> 00:47:33,273
It was all over TV. I had to do something.

424
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,935
I'm grateful, of course.

425
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:39,438
But I still need to know why you're not
telling me the truth about your father.

426
00:47:41,115 --> 00:47:45,112
Well, I suppose the world's greatest
detective will find out eventually.

427
00:47:45,286 --> 00:47:50,078
You remember Daddy was having
a meeting that night with his partners.

428
00:47:59,174 --> 00:48:03,760
- You're a liar and a cheat, Carl.
- You've taken what's ours.

429
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:06,634
- You're gonna pay, one way or another.
- No, please.

430
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:08,640
Daddy, what's going on?

431
00:48:10,352 --> 00:48:13,389
I'm sorry you had to see this, Miss Beaumont.

432
00:48:15,983 --> 00:48:18,474
- Let her go!
- Watch it, Carl.

433
00:48:19,903 --> 00:48:23,319
Please, Sal. Give me one more day.
I swear I'll get the money.

434
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,317
Convince me.

435
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:27,651
This time tomorrow. On my mother's grave.

436
00:48:27,828 --> 00:48:32,289
As soon as the European banks open,
I'll have the whole amount wired to you.

437
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:45,926
Twenty-four hours.

438
00:48:46,138 --> 00:48:49,092
This time tomorrow we'll have the money...

439
00:48:49,266 --> 00:48:52,516
...or I'll have your heart in my hand.

440
00:48:52,686 --> 00:48:54,478
Let's go, boys.

441
00:49:06,033 --> 00:49:08,524
- Dad, are you all right?
- Pack a suitcase.

442
00:49:08,702 --> 00:49:11,110
- We've got to get to the airport now.
- What?

443
00:49:11,288 --> 00:49:14,206
- But you said you'd have the money.
- It's not that simple.

444
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:17,578
The money's tied up in investments.
It could take weeks to free up.

445
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:19,081
But I can't leave.

446
00:49:19,254 --> 00:49:21,710
Bruce proposed to me.
We're going to get married.

447
00:49:21,882 --> 00:49:23,211
Listen to me.

448
00:49:23,384 --> 00:49:26,835
I just used up the last shred of pity
Sal Valestra has.

449
00:49:27,012 --> 00:49:31,224
If I don't pay him back within 24 hours,
they'll find us and they'll kill us both.

450
00:49:31,392 --> 00:49:34,179
How... Why did you do this, Dad?

451
00:49:34,353 --> 00:49:36,429
Why did you get involved with these people?

452
00:49:36,605 --> 00:49:38,147
I'm sorry, Andi.

453
00:49:38,315 --> 00:49:40,771
I just wanted a chance for you...

454
00:49:40,943 --> 00:49:43,979
I'll get you out of this.
Somehow, we'll be free of those guys.

455
00:49:44,154 --> 00:49:48,366
Whatever it takes. That's a promise.

456
00:49:50,494 --> 00:49:54,408
From that night, we were on the run.
We hid all over Europe.

457
00:49:54,581 --> 00:49:56,907
Eventually settled on
the Mediterranean coast.

458
00:49:57,084 --> 00:50:01,580
Dad was able to parlay the money
he embezzled into a fortune.

459
00:50:02,214 --> 00:50:05,298
Finally he had enough
to pay them back, or so he thought.

460
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:06,926
It would never be enough.

461
00:50:07,094 --> 00:50:09,881
They wanted interest compounded in blood.

462
00:50:10,055 --> 00:50:11,384
We had to find another way.

463
00:50:11,557 --> 00:50:14,308
The man in the costume. Your father?

464
00:50:14,476 --> 00:50:16,802
He said he'd get them. Somehow.

465
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:22,020
When I heard about Chuckie Sol,
well, I had to come back to find him.

466
00:50:22,192 --> 00:50:25,146
To stop him. I'm sorry, Bruce.

467
00:50:25,362 --> 00:50:30,071
That's twice now I've come
into your life and screwed it up.

468
00:51:08,656 --> 00:51:11,028
Can we make it work this time?

469
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,358
I want to say yes...

470
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,739
...but you know it's going to come down
between me and your father.

471
00:51:16,914 --> 00:51:19,583
Daddy doesn't matter anymore.

472
00:51:31,637 --> 00:51:34,424
- I'll see you tonight.
- I'll be here.

473
00:51:39,979 --> 00:51:43,145
It's so good to see you
and Miss Beaumont together again.

474
00:51:43,315 --> 00:51:47,395
Might one ask what this bodes
for your alter ego?

475
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,151
I'm not sure, Alfred.

476
00:51:52,741 --> 00:51:55,695
Everything's happening so fast.

477
00:51:56,912 --> 00:52:00,198
- So much has changed.
- You still love each other.

478
00:52:00,374 --> 00:52:02,034
It's true.

479
00:52:02,209 --> 00:52:03,869
I love her.

480
00:52:04,086 --> 00:52:06,873
Maybe after this is settled...

481
00:52:07,047 --> 00:52:08,625
...maybe then.

482
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:11,372
I'm sure they would've wanted you
to be happy, sir.

483
00:52:19,977 --> 00:52:23,346
- Hm.
- Is something wrong?

484
00:52:23,564 --> 00:52:25,889
Maybe.

485
00:52:30,487 --> 00:52:31,982
Oh, no.

486
00:52:40,623 --> 00:52:45,453
You're telling me there were four precincts
on Batman and he still got away?

487
00:52:48,631 --> 00:52:50,789
Unbelievable.

488
00:52:51,592 --> 00:52:53,134
Tsk, tsk.

489
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:56,753
And to think our tax money
goes to pay those jerks.

490
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,641
You!

491
00:53:02,936 --> 00:53:06,685
That's right, Artie.
Bring in the press, why don't you.

492
00:53:06,857 --> 00:53:11,151
What a photo op.
The councilman and his wacky pal.

493
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:12,904
You're no friend of mine.

494
00:53:14,323 --> 00:53:19,400
Oh, Artie, I'm crushed.
How the high and mighty forget.

495
00:53:19,578 --> 00:53:24,240
Don't you remember?
You, me, Sallie and the gang?

496
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:25,958
What are you talking about?

497
00:53:26,502 --> 00:53:30,001
I never met them or you.
I worked for Beaumont.

498
00:53:30,172 --> 00:53:33,873
- I didn't know what he was doing.
- Oh, but you knew about it afterwards.

499
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:37,005
And put it to good use, eh?

500
00:53:37,638 --> 00:53:42,264
- What do you want?
- To find out who's iced the old gang.

501
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,931
Haven't you read the papers? It's Batman.

502
00:53:48,023 --> 00:53:50,146
Wrong. It ain't the Bat.

503
00:53:50,317 --> 00:53:52,310
Nope, nope. I've seen the guy.

504
00:53:52,486 --> 00:53:55,440
He looks more like
the Ghost of Christmas Future.

505
00:53:55,614 --> 00:53:58,401
Nowhere near as cute as Batboy.

506
00:53:58,575 --> 00:54:01,113
- You're saying it's someone else?
- Yeah.

507
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:06,625
Someone who wouldn't mind seeing
our old pals out of the way.

508
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:12,121
Maybe... Gulp! Sob! ...me too.

509
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:14,919
That's when I thought about you, Arturo.

510
00:54:15,092 --> 00:54:19,172
An important, upstanding guy like you
could find it awkward...

511
00:54:19,346 --> 00:54:22,513
...if certain secrets
were revealed about his past.

512
00:54:23,058 --> 00:54:26,308
Wait. You're not saying that I...

513
00:54:26,478 --> 00:54:28,352
<i>Mr. Reeves? Miss Beaumont on the line.</i>

514
00:54:28,522 --> 00:54:29,803
Beaumont?

515
00:54:29,982 --> 00:54:31,524
Not the babe?

516
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:35,105
Oh, you devil.

517
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:38,399
<i>Arthur?</i>

518
00:54:38,741 --> 00:54:41,029
- <i>Arthur, are you there?</i>
- Shh.

519
00:54:41,744 --> 00:54:45,492
Hello, Andrea.
We're still on for lunch, right?

520
00:54:45,664 --> 00:54:51,370
I'm sorry, I can't, I got hung up.
I'll explain everything tonight, okay?

521
00:54:52,004 --> 00:54:55,420
All right. I'll see you then.

522
00:54:55,883 --> 00:54:58,588
Now, ain't that a coinkidink.

523
00:54:58,761 --> 00:55:04,051
We're talking about the old man, and the
spawn of his loins just happens to call.

524
00:55:04,266 --> 00:55:08,809
Makes you want to laugh, doesn't it, Artie?

525
00:55:31,627 --> 00:55:33,370
Good heavens.

526
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:37,254
Councilman, please,
you've got to control yourself.

527
00:55:37,466 --> 00:55:41,511
- I'm trying, for God's sake.
- Here's the relaxant you ordered.

528
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:46,509
I need some help. Hold him still.

529
00:55:47,142 --> 00:55:49,764
Councilman, please.

530
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:51,686
That's it.

531
00:55:51,855 --> 00:55:54,525
That's right.

532
00:55:56,235 --> 00:55:59,520
There. That should relax you enough
for the toxin to run its course.

533
00:55:59,697 --> 00:56:01,155
Now, try to stay calm.

534
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:05,611
Okay.

535
00:56:08,664 --> 00:56:11,202
<i>Dr. Blair, come to Outpatient Counseling.</i>

536
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:28,755
Oh, no.

537
00:56:29,184 --> 00:56:31,224
Why did the Joker meet with you?

538
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:38,355
It has to do with the gangster murders,
doesn't it? He thinks you're involved.

539
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:40,235
Why?

540
00:56:42,865 --> 00:56:44,692
I don't know.

541
00:56:45,993 --> 00:56:48,116
That's not the answer I want.

542
00:56:50,247 --> 00:56:54,909
Beaumont needed me to help him
and his kid get out of town.

543
00:56:55,085 --> 00:56:56,496
We kept in touch.

544
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,579
When was the last time you spoke to him?

545
00:56:58,756 --> 00:57:02,374
Years ago. My first election campaign.

546
00:57:02,551 --> 00:57:05,635
I was running out of money
and asked Beaumont for help.

547
00:57:06,847 --> 00:57:09,136
He said no.

548
00:57:09,683 --> 00:57:11,759
So you sold him to the Mob.

549
00:57:15,147 --> 00:57:17,353
I was broke, desperate.

550
00:57:17,524 --> 00:57:20,893
They said all they wanted
was their money back.

551
00:57:28,118 --> 00:57:30,905
- Councilman, please.
- Nurse.

552
00:58:13,956 --> 00:58:17,040
Hello, anybody home?

553
00:58:17,209 --> 00:58:21,705
Listen, boopsy, even though
you never call and never write...

554
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,122
...I still got a soft spot for you.

555
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,419
So I'm sending you a fun gift, airmail.

556
00:58:27,594 --> 00:58:32,256
<i>And there's no use jumping
out the window this time, toots.</i>

557
00:58:32,433 --> 00:58:37,178
<i>The plane of the future
is going to make you history.</i>

558
00:58:47,573 --> 00:58:49,731
<i>Hello? Hello, operator?</i>

559
00:58:49,908 --> 00:58:54,321
<i>I believe my party's been disconnected.</i>

560
00:59:19,146 --> 00:59:23,144
You? But he paid you.

561
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:25,941
Dad?

562
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:44,169
Well, Haz, guess it's time
to call it a night.

563
00:59:47,675 --> 00:59:53,298
What do you say, hon?
Feeling the old electricity tonight?

564
00:59:59,478 --> 01:00:00,889
Ain't it always the way?

565
01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:04,598
You get in the mood and company shows up.

566
01:00:05,693 --> 01:00:09,904
Joker. Your angel of death awaits.

567
01:00:10,114 --> 01:00:12,153
I'm impressed, lady.

568
01:00:12,324 --> 01:00:15,942
You're harder to kill
than a cockroach on steroids.

569
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:19,079
So you figured it out?

570
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:22,908
Gotta hand it to you, nice scheme.

571
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:26,869
Costume's a bit theatrical,
but, hey, who am I to talk.

572
01:00:36,765 --> 01:00:42,139
Very cute. But I can blow smoke too, toots.

573
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:53,069
Nice trick, sweetheart.

574
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,656
You could teach old Batsy
a thing or two about disappearing.

575
01:00:59,913 --> 01:01:04,125
You're not smiling, Joker.
I thought you found death amusing.

576
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:08,160
Me? Oh, no.
You won't hear a giggle out of me.

577
01:01:14,178 --> 01:01:15,969
Made you look.

578
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,621
Well, if it isn't Smokey the Babe.

579
01:01:51,799 --> 01:01:54,669
Just in time to meet her biggest fan.

580
01:02:00,057 --> 01:02:03,390
How about a little pick-me-up?

581
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,043
Your father's dead, isn't he?

582
01:03:18,218 --> 01:03:20,888
You came into town early
to get Chuckie Sol...

583
01:03:21,055 --> 01:03:24,139
...so you could shift the blame
to your father if you had to.

584
01:03:24,308 --> 01:03:29,136
They took everything, Bruce.
My dad, my life. You.

585
01:03:29,313 --> 01:03:33,227
I'm not saying it's right, or even sane,
but it's all I've got left.

586
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,689
So either help me or get out of the way.

587
01:03:35,861 --> 01:03:39,312
- You know I can't do that.
- Look what they did to us.

588
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:42,775
What we could've had. They had to pay.

589
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:46,320
But, Andi, what will vengeance solve?

590
01:03:46,497 --> 01:03:51,206
If anyone knows the answer
to that, Bruce, it's you.

591
01:03:52,336 --> 01:03:55,420
Leave, Andi. Now.

592
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,505
Please.

593
01:04:10,062 --> 01:04:12,731
Oh, Batsy.

594
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:16,267
Yoo-hoo.

595
01:05:10,748 --> 01:05:12,621
Joker.

596
01:06:10,015 --> 01:06:12,423
You're too late, Batman.

597
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:15,436
There are 20 miles of tunnels
under this place...

598
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:17,929
...and they're all filled
with high explosives.

599
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:22,484
In five minutes, everything goes up.

600
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:26,789
You just don't know when to quit, do you?

601
01:07:31,805 --> 01:07:33,928
What are you doing?

602
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:38,717
You're crazy. I'm your only chance
to get out of here.

603
01:07:38,896 --> 01:07:41,351
Let me go or we'll both die.

604
01:07:41,523 --> 01:07:43,599
Whatever it takes.

605
01:08:04,838 --> 01:08:09,631
For once, I'm stuck without a punch line.

606
01:08:10,511 --> 01:08:11,922
Uh-oh.

607
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:15,801
Okay. I give up.

608
01:08:15,975 --> 01:08:17,766
I surrendered already.

609
01:08:17,935 --> 01:08:20,342
- Tell her, Batman.
- Andrea.

610
01:08:20,562 --> 01:08:23,350
You've got to get out of here.

611
01:08:23,524 --> 01:08:26,857
This place is wired to explode.

612
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,189
No. One way or another, it ends tonight.

613
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:32,198
Goodbye, my love.

614
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,906
Andrea!

615
01:10:06,293 --> 01:10:08,333
I couldn't save her, Alfred.

616
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:10,792
I don't think she wanted to be saved, sir.

617
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:14,127
Vengeance blackens the soul, Bruce.

618
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:18,133
I always feared you would become
that which you fought against.

619
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:22,214
You walk the edge of that abyss
every night, but you haven't fallen in...

620
01:10:22,434 --> 01:10:25,305
...and I thank heaven for that.

621
01:10:27,648 --> 01:10:30,898
But Andrea fell into that pit years ago.

622
01:10:31,068 --> 01:10:34,022
And no one, not even you,
could've pulled her back.

623
01:10:44,665 --> 01:10:46,325
What is it?

624
01:11:30,002 --> 01:11:32,125
- Quite a sight.
- Yes.

625
01:11:33,005 --> 01:11:37,050

626
01:11:37,217 --> 01:11:39,175
I am.

627
01:11:40,305 --> 01:12:40,751
