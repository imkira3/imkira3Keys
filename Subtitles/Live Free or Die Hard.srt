1
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,166
Well?

2
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,629
- I'm sending you the code.
- Yes, I see that. Thank you.

3
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:56,387
- What about my account?
- Delivering.

4
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:20,120
I just sent it. You should have it.

5
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:23,624
- Yes. Thank you.
- Are you sure this is legal?

6
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:27,211
We're just running a test
on our security system, sir. It's fine.

7
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:30,797
You've got a sexy voice.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

8
00:01:30,881 --> 00:01:32,925
- To you?
- We have all we need.

9
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:44,811
We're ready.

10
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:57,783
Yo, guess who just made 50 Gs today.

11
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:06,458
- What'd you do to my drive?
- I didn't touch it.

12
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:09,503
This isn't cool.
Don't ever, ever touch my computer.

13
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,543
FBI CYBER-SECURITY DIVISION
WASHINGTON, D.C.

14
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,618
Diagnostics show no damage,
but this was an intentional breach.

15
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,621
- We were hacked?
- It wasn't "Denial of Service" level,

16
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,498
but they definitely cracked our door.

17
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,876
OK. Open the Black Hat files.

18
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,963
I want every hacker in the country
who could have done this interviewed now.

19
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:39,135
Sir, that's close to 1,000 names. This
holiday weekend we're short-staffed as it is.

20
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,223
We're the ones supposed to keep this from
happening, and it happened to us. Do it.

21
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,892
Sir, it's night.
They're all over the country.

22
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,853
Get local law enforcement help.

23
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:53,150
Somebody out there thinks they can
screw with us. I wanna find out who.

24
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,470
- Jim. I said no.
- Lucy, you're killin' me, all right?

25
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,639
- Get out.
- What?

26
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,933
- Get out of the car now.
- Don't touch me.

27
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,893
- No means no.
- What are you doin'

28
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,438
- John, stop it.
- Don't call me that. I hate it when you do.

29
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,149
- You know this guy?
- Just shut your mouth right now.

30
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,944
Dad. Stop it. I mean it.

31
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,072
- "Dad"? You said your dad was dead.
- What?

32
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,951
You told this jerk-off I was dead?
You actually said that?

33
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,912
I may have exaggerated a little bit.

34
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,291
And this guy's what? Your boyfriend?

35
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,501
- No.
- Yeah.

36
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,338
I don't know, OK?
I'm sorry. We'll see.

37
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,300
What are you doing here?

38
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:03,221
- You don't answer your phone, return calls.
- Because I'm not talking to you.

39
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:08,018
- Why aren't we talking this time, Lucy?
- Why not? What? You want a list?

40
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:12,856
How about stuff like this: You spy on me,
you drag my boyfriend out of the car...

41
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,941
- You said he's not your boyfriend.
- He's not.

42
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:18,028
- I thought you said I just was.
- Shut up.

43
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:22,407
You are such an asshole.

44
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:30,081
OK. I'm sorry I pulled your "not-boyfriend"
out of the car, OK?

45
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,879
- Lucy, baby, get in the car. Let's go.
- No, no.

46
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:38,340
- Will both of you go away?
- Just talk to me.

47
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:41,134
I'm tired. I'm going to bed... alone.

48
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:44,763
Damn right you're going to bed alone.

49
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:48,850
Lucy, honey, wait a minute.
I wanna talk to you. Just wait.

50
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:51,853
Dad, when I wanna talk to you -

51
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,272
if I wanna talk to you -

52
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:57,901
I'll call you.

53
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:01,279
Lucy. Wait, Lucy. Lucy.

54
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:05,075
- Lucy McClane.
- It's not McClane. It's Gennero.

55
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:09,704
Chicks, right?

56
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,378
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

57
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:45,992
John?

58
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:48,494
John? It's Sclavino.

59
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:54,041
- Go for McClane.
- What are you doing at Rutgers?

60
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,587
- How do you know where I am?
- Our cars were LoJacked four years ago.

61
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,049
- I'm staring at exactly where you are.
- Sir, that's not something I would turn on.

62
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:05,386
Yeah, we did that.
John, we turned them on.

63
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:07,847
Listen, the feds have called in a favour.

64
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,351
They're doing a sweep. They want us to
pick up some computer hacker in Camden.

65
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:15,563
Last name: Farrell.
First name: Matthew.

66
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:18,524
Whoa, whoa. Camden?
What are you telling me this for?

67
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:22,028
- Just came in.
- Vino, it's 3am. I was on my way home.

68
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,072
Send ajughead from the Academy.
They'd be happy to do it.

69
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:29,661
I can't just send in a uniform.
The feds demanded a senior detective.

70
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:32,247
The kid's a high-value subject -
I don't know.

71
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:36,001
Just pick him up, escort him
to the Hoover Building in DC.

72
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:39,963
They had some kind of a computer breach
there this morning.

73
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:42,007
Great.

74
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,262
All right, give me that information.
Give me that name again. What is it?

75
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:49,139
You owe me one, Jack.

76
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:44,153
What?

77
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:56,583
Aw, come on.

78
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:05,592
Goddammit.

79
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:21,608
PLAN B. WE DO IT OURSELVES.

80
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,161
- Who is it?
- NYPD. Open the door, please.

81
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:42,462
- Hi.
- NYPD?

82
00:09:42,545 --> 00:09:47,342
OK. I get it. Don't worry, everyone
gets lost around here. Glad to help. Take...

83
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:51,221
I'm not lost. Are you Matthew Farrell?

84
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:54,599
No. He actually does not live here any more.

85
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:58,312
- Course not. Who are you?
- My name is Daisy Duke.

86
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:03,901
Got a lot of shit for it when I was a kid.
Please don't add to it.

87
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:07,821
- Can I see some identification, please?
- Yeah, sure.

88
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,247
"Detective". Yeah, that looks real.
You get that at Toys "R" Us? Looks great.

89
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:21,043
- Then of course...
- Yeah. That actually looks pretty good.

90
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:26,423
Farrell. Sully PDL-ed the new copy of
the <i>Kill Zone Nine.</i> Wanna check it out?

91
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:30,970
No. Thanks, though, man.
And good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.

92
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,181
Open the door.

93
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:35,683
Shit.

94
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:44,525
Can I get you something?
Coffee? A warrant?

95
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:47,861
- What's this about?
- I don't know. Some computer thing.

96
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:50,948
DC feds wanna talk to you, so let's go.

97
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:54,451
- Feds?
- Yeah. The feds.

98
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:06,630
I've been White Hat for four years,
but once you're on that goddamn list...

99
00:11:06,714 --> 00:11:08,507
Such a pain in the ass.

100
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:11,011
You play with dolls?

101
00:11:11,094 --> 00:11:13,471
- Could you not touch that?
- Like a GI Joe?

102
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:16,641
No, it's not. It's a limited edition,

103
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:17,517
and...

104
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:21,271
- That supposed to come off?
- No, but it's more valuable broken,

105
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:25,275
- so thanks for that.
- Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.

106
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:27,611
I got some other cool shit you can break.

107
00:11:27,694 --> 00:11:31,531
- Let's go, OK? Come on.
- I gotta power down my gear, OK?

108
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,787
More dolls. Not spending
a whole lot of time with the girls.

109
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:42,626
Are you really trying to escape?

110
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,128
Jesus, don't shoot.

111
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:46,630
Get down.

112
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:55,388
- Jesus Christ.
- Stay right there.

113
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,198
Go.

114
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:17,035
Let's go. Come on.
Low, low. Stay down.

115
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:18,787
Come on.

116
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:30,466
It's all right. Stay low, all right? Stay down.

117
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,970
- You stay with me, all right? Here we go.
- OK.

118
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,600
OK.

119
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,493
That'll wake the neighbours.

120
00:12:58,703 --> 00:13:00,580
Get down. Get inside.

121
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,545
They're back in the room.
They're back in the room.

122
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,385
Are you nuts? Get outta there right now.

123
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:16,095
- I'm trying to...
- Now.

124
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:57,304
Get back in there.

125
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,355
Get ready to run.

126
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:25,935
- What the hell was that?
- What?

127
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:29,022
- Did you do that?
- No.

128
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:32,066
- Shit.
- I didn't do that. Come on.

129
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,696
- Shit.
- Stay close. The whole apartment's on fire.

130
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:41,784
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, let's go, goddammit.

131
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:45,330
Come on.

132
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:47,415
Watch it. Slow it down.

133
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:51,252
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

134
00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:53,671
Let's go. Come on.

135
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:57,467
Come on, come on. Stay close.

136
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:11,565
Stay with me. Stay with me.

137
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:16,862
Come on, let's go. Stay close.

138
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:21,617
Get in the car. Go, go.

139
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:30,501
- Kid, can you reload a gun?
- What? Me?

140
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:32,878
- Can you reload a gun?
- I...

141
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:37,132
Open the glove box
and get a magazine out right now.

142
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:44,265
Grab the gun from the back seat.

143
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:05,619
You OK?

144
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:16,922
Get your head down.

145
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,803
Jesus! Is the circus in town?

146
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:34,232
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it. I did it.

147
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:41,489
Camden base, 10077. Come back.
Camden base, 10077.

148
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:42,991
Go ahead.

149
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:46,953
I need to speak to your chief of your
detectives. Police emergency, asap.

150
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:48,538
Stand by.

151
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:53,043
- This is Chief Detective Wiesman.
- This is Detective John McClane, NYPD.

152
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:57,505
Police emergency. I wanna report
a police shooting in yourjurisdiction.

153
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,272
YOU TELL HER.

154
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:20,237
- Yeah?
- What's the status?

155
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:22,155
WE DIDN'T GET HIM.

156
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:24,157
THREE OF OUR MEN ARE DOWN.

157
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:27,494
Wait one.

158
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:53,771
Thomas. We had a problem in New Jersey.
Farrell's still alive.

159
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:57,525
- So he got away.
- Yeah.

160
00:18:57,608 --> 00:18:59,986
I did send five of you, is that right?

161
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:06,742
I'm sending a chopper. Get airborne and we'll
track 'em down. Think you can handle that?

162
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:14,625
- Oh, my God.
- Just breathe.

163
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:18,129
I am breathing. I can't stop shaking.

164
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:21,090
It's the adrenaline.
You're just scared. It'll pass.

165
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:25,344
Yeah, I'm scared.
Weren't you scared, back there?

166
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:28,639
Yeah. I was scared.

167
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:33,436
Really? This is you being scared?
I don't know, cos you seem really calm.

168
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,771
Have you done stuff like that before?

169
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:39,525
- Stuff like what?
- Like killing people.

170
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:44,780
Yeah. But not for a long time.

171
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:48,994
So who were those guys?
Why were they trying to kill you?

172
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:52,497
Why did they blow up
my goddamn apartment?

173
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:55,542
They were there to kill you.

174
00:19:55,626 --> 00:20:00,797
- Why would they want to kill me?
- You tell me, kid. You're the criminal.

175
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:19,858
We got seven dead hackers so far,
none of whom were high on our list.

176
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:23,654
- Get the hard drives, start sweepin' 'em.
- Yes, sir.

177
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:31,495
Trey. Matthew Farrell - find him for me.

178
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,413
On it.

179
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,918
What's with all the guns?

180
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:40,712
Operational prudence.

181
00:20:41,296 --> 00:20:45,342
Think of them as hardware to your software.

182
00:20:55,978 --> 00:21:00,774
Good morning, DC. It's shaping up
to be a beautiful Fourth of July weekend.

183
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:05,697
If you've got any big plans, get started
early, cos the traffic is ramping up.

184
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,492
So here's another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.

185
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:14,330
What? What... What...

186
00:21:14,414 --> 00:21:16,708
What are you doing? What is that?

187
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,751
- It's Creedence.
- Creedence?

188
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:23,006
Creedence. Creedence Clearwater
Revival? Classic rock?

189
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:26,342
I know who it is. It's old rock.
Doesn't make it classic.

190
00:21:26,426 --> 00:21:29,387
- What sucked then sucks now.
- You don't like Creedence?

191
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,640
This is like having a pine cone
shoved in my ass.

192
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:36,561
OK. Really? Wow, that's mature.

193
00:21:36,644 --> 00:21:38,605
Come on. I'm cooperating with you.

194
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:44,527
We're at a heading of 060.
Making another pass.

195
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,658
Listen up, everyone.
Are we ready?

196
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:54,454
Transportation hubs are prepped and set.

197
00:21:54,537 --> 00:21:56,581
Begin stage one.

198
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:15,684
What? Nothing.

199
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:35,287
When'd you last turn on the radio and listen
to popular music? Just give me a decade.

200
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:39,458
The '70s? I'm guessing.
Was Michael Jackson still black?

201
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,503
Pearl Jam.
I'll go back ten years with you. Ten years.

202
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:44,505
20 years. The Cure? Nothin'

203
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:49,927
It's called news radio. I want to see if your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

204
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,388
Hold on. You listen to the news?

205
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,558
You got a problem with the news now?

206
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:58,686
Yeah. I got a big goddamn problem
with the news.

207
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:02,481
Ready for this?
The news is completely manipulated.

208
00:23:02,565 --> 00:23:05,776
Everything you hear, every single day,

209
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:11,031
is designed by corporate media to do
one thing only: To keep you living in fear.

210
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:12,992
- Fear?
- Total fear.

211
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:17,204
So you'll go out and spend money
on things you probably don't even need,

212
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:20,040
so advertisers
keep buying ads on their stations.

213
00:23:20,124 --> 00:23:24,169
I'll tell you one more thing. I'll do this
all day. I got days of data at home...

214
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:26,338
I'll drop a bomb on you...

215
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,173
- What?
- Shut up.

216
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:31,636
That's good. Be dismissive instead of...

217
00:24:23,355 --> 00:24:26,066
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

218
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:29,736
Just stay in the car. You'll be all right.

219
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:34,074
Hey, man. Hey.

220
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,827
You all right? Don't move.
Just call 911, all right?

221
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:39,913
OK.

222
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:42,791
Jesus Christ.

223
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,524
All the lights are green.

224
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:09,277
All the lights are green.
Let's go. Right now.

225
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,488
- We gotta go?
- Get your bag, hack-boy. Let's go.

226
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:17,368
- Let's go.
- I've never been in a car accident.

227
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:19,787
Well, it's very exciting. This way, come on.

228
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,706
- You been in a car accident?
- Yeah.

229
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:22,999
What are we doing?

230
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:27,712
It's a little thing they invented in the '60s
called jogging. You're gonna love it.

231
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:41,183
Sir, Chicago's reporting
a systems crash on the el train network.

232
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:48,107
Amtrak is flashing a level-one crash
in their com system.

233
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,445
FAAjust issued a critical alert.
Their ATC net just went down.

234
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:54,530
We're under attack.

235
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,994
OK, let's get 'em outside for a little fresh air.

236
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:12,299
That's the anthrax alarm.

237
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:17,095
All right, everyone out. Now. Now.

238
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:22,893
Taylor, move. Go. Move.

239
00:26:37,574 --> 00:26:42,955
All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

240
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:45,040
This is not a drill.

241
00:26:45,123 --> 00:26:51,129
All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

242
00:27:10,357 --> 00:27:11,985
We need you inside, sir.

243
00:27:18,116 --> 00:27:22,787
Take your team. I want men
on the fourth floor, got it? Masks on.

244
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,624
We gotta know what's there.

245
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:30,128
Run a trunk search on these data crashes,
try to ID the point of origin.

246
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:35,216
Begin stage two.

247
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:44,475
What's going on?

248
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:53,109
They're already starting to panic.

249
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,281
Of course they are.

250
00:27:58,364 --> 00:28:00,909
They think that someone's
taking their money.

251
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:04,746
All those nickels and dimes they saved
had meaning.

252
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:07,874
"Useful idiots", as Lenin would say.

253
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,877
Prep the video package.

254
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:28,604
DC transportation system's crashing and
they just hit the financial sector. All of it.

255
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:33,484
Get me the secretary for trans and treasury
on the line and the chairman of the SEC.

256
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:37,988
Let's go, people. Somewhere
somebody left a digital fingerprint. Find it.

257
00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:41,909
- Deputy Director Bowman in here?
- Not now. It'll have to wait.

258
00:28:41,992 --> 00:28:46,121
Not today. This is Matthew Farrell.
I brought him here on orders from Bowman.

259
00:28:46,205 --> 00:28:49,333
If you don't know what's goin' on,
find somebody that does.

260
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,626
I'm Bowman.

261
00:28:56,507 --> 00:28:59,385
Video package is ready for upload.

262
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:05,182
John, I appreciate your bringing Farrell,

263
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:08,269
but we are neck-deep
in damage control right now.

264
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:12,523
Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Do you have
anything to eat, any snacks around?

265
00:29:12,606 --> 00:29:15,109
I'd love...
I've got really low blood sugar...

266
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:17,486
- Sir?
- No?

267
00:29:21,115 --> 00:29:26,078
As if the transportation breakdown and
anthrax scares weren't enough for one day,

268
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:29,248
the stock market
found itself in a selling frenzy.

269
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:32,251
The FTC believes this panic
might have been triggered

270
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:35,713
by a computer malfunction
in the stock exchange.

271
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:38,925
Man, that is all bad.

272
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:43,179
It's not as bad as it looks. We run drills
to prepare for things like this.

273
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:45,932
- These your suspects?
- Were.

274
00:29:46,016 --> 00:29:48,643
All seven were killed in the last 24 hours.

275
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:53,064
Recognise any of these people?

276
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:55,901
No.

277
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:57,777
Not one?

278
00:29:57,861 --> 00:30:00,780
Sir, we got a system error.

279
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,836
- My fellow Americans...
...it is time to...

280
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,048
strike... fear... into...
the hearts of... citizenry.

281
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,593
- Ask not...
- That's an unauthorised broadcast.

282
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:24,679
...what your country can do...
to avert... this... crisis.

283
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:27,557
- The answer is...
...nothing whatsoever.

284
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:31,144
Our military... strength...
is... in this case...

285
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,520
...useless.

286
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,149
Read my lips.

287
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:41,613
The... great... confident... roar...
of... American... progress... and... growth...

288
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:44,366
has come to... an end.

289
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:48,620
All the... vital... technology...
that... this nation... holds dear...

290
00:30:48,703 --> 00:30:52,833
all... communications... transportation...
the internet... connectivity...

291
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,962
electrical... power...
critical... utilities...

292
00:30:56,587 --> 00:31:00,883
their... fate... now... rests...
in... our... hands.

293
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:04,470
We will not tire, we will not falter,

294
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:06,347
and we will not fail.

295
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,183
I don't know how they're getting in.

296
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,142
Thank you.

297
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:13,020
And a... happy Independence Day...
to everyone.

298
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,609
That was creepy.

299
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:20,570
I tried to find more Nixon.

300
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,281
Think they bought it?

301
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:25,408
Absolutely.

302
00:31:28,077 --> 00:31:31,289
OK, I want telecom, transportation...

303
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:34,166
- Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.
- What?

304
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:38,129
It's a fire sale.

305
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:40,798
- We don't know that yet.
- It's a myth, anyway.

306
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:45,303
It's a myth? Really? Please tell me
she's actually not in charge of anything.

307
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:47,346
What's a fire sale?

308
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,893
It's a three-step systematic attack
on the entire national infrastructure.

309
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:56,355
Step one: Take out transportation.
Step two: The financial base and telecoms.

310
00:31:56,439 --> 00:32:00,359
Step three: Get rid of all the utilities -
gas, water electric, nuclear...

311
00:32:00,443 --> 00:32:04,906
Anything that's run by computers,
which today is almost everything.

312
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:08,076
That's why they call it a fire sale -
everything must go.

313
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,662
Listen. What's your name? Farrell?

314
00:32:10,746 --> 00:32:14,917
Keep your voice down, OK?
No one here's talking about a fire sale.

315
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,046
Not unless you're telling me
you helped plan one.

316
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:21,465
No, man. I'm just saying...

317
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:24,176
Appreciate your concern.
We're on it. Thank you.

318
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:27,221
- You've done a bang-up job so far.
- What? What?

319
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:31,141
Nothing. I said I understand.

320
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:36,647
They didn't send the girl scouts out to get this
kid. They sent professionals, full tactical gear.

321
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:42,444
They blew the joint up. I don't know this kid,
and frankly I don't give a shit - no offence -

322
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,780
but somebody wants this kid dead,

323
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:49,076
and obviously it's got something to do
with whatever's going on here.

324
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:52,621
OK. Homeland's interrogating
the hackers we're bringing in.

325
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,624
I'll get you an escort over there. All right?

326
00:32:55,707 --> 00:33:01,088
Molina, get this kid to the front of the line.
I wanna know what he knows.

327
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:04,258
If he knew half the shit I know,
his head would explode.

328
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:07,302
Special Agent Johnson. We'll take the sedan.

329
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:11,014
- Agent Johnson?
- That's right. Right this way.

330
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:15,602
Great. So is any of that actually possible,
what you were saying back there?

331
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:20,232
Is it possible? Look, you take out
any one thing, the system can recover.

332
00:33:20,316 --> 00:33:25,738
If you take it all down at once, the system
crashes and... Look around, man.

333
00:33:25,822 --> 00:33:30,493
Come on. Government's gotta have dozens
of departments dedicated to that shit.

334
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:34,831
It took FEMA five days
to get water to the Superdome.

335
00:33:57,896 --> 00:34:00,523
How long till we get to DHS?

336
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:05,403
Laughlin, get on the DC police band
and get 'em to clear a route to DHS for us.

337
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:08,448
DC Metro, this is the FBI
requesting you to clear a route...

338
00:34:12,368 --> 00:34:14,495
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

339
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:17,665
- Feds are taking him to Homeland.
- Good.

340
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:20,543
- Close that loop, now.
- Isolate the frequency.

341
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:25,131
Get us a location on the vehicles
and pull me up a file on this John McClane.

342
00:34:25,214 --> 00:34:28,343
Rand, we just found Farrell.
Stand by for a location.

343
00:34:32,513 --> 00:34:36,518
I don't mean to harp, but we just passed
another Arby's, and I'm starving.

344
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:38,771
- I could eat a wrapper.
- Shut up.

345
00:34:38,854 --> 00:34:42,066
- I could just get some ketchup packets.
- Shut up.

346
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:44,944
You got about 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me.

347
00:34:45,027 --> 00:34:47,404
Lied to you? What are you talking about?

348
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:49,865
The pictures on the wall -
you knew those guys.

349
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:52,576
- I don't...
- Kid, don't lie to me.

350
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,871
I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.
Who were they?

351
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:01,418
OK. OK, OK.

352
00:35:03,671 --> 00:35:06,799
They were my competition.

353
00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:11,679
Make the next right onto Concord.

354
00:35:11,762 --> 00:35:15,099
They said they'd developed
a mutating encryption algorithm

355
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:17,601
and they wanted to see if it could be cracked.

356
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:21,146
That's what I do. I do math-based security.

357
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:30,114
Here's the thing. To pull off something
as massive and crazy as a fire sale,

358
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:34,285
you need tons of guys to write programs,
but only a few Black Hats to implement it.

359
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:38,998
At that point the start-up guys, who haven't
really done anything wrong, like me...

360
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:41,542
Would end up as pictures on some guy's wall.

361
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:47,047
I swear to God, McClane, I swear to you
I had no idea I was gonna be...

362
00:35:47,631 --> 00:35:50,135
an accessory to Armageddon.

363
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,721
Take the next left at Lexington.

364
00:35:52,804 --> 00:35:56,975
And that's a sexy voice.
What's she taking us this way for?

365
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:58,727
- Unit 510.
- Oh, my God.

366
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,938
Clear a route for two FBI vehicles
approaching on Concord.

367
00:36:02,022 --> 00:36:03,315
Copy, dispatch.

368
00:36:03,398 --> 00:36:04,858
That's her.

369
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:06,985
- Her who?
- What are you talking about?

370
00:36:09,112 --> 00:36:11,406
- It's them.
- You're saying it's "them" them?

371
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:15,410
I swear to you I know her.
I would know her voice anywhere.

372
00:36:16,494 --> 00:36:20,999
- No, don't say anything...
- Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.

373
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:23,668
Hey, Metro, how's your day goin' over there?

374
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:28,173
Gotta be pretty crazy over there,
what with all those 587s.

375
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:31,259
Yes, sir. We've had to dispatch all units.

376
00:36:32,427 --> 00:36:36,556
You had to dispatch all units
for all the naked people walking around?

377
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,101
Cut the bullshit, honey,
and just put your boss on.

378
00:36:42,395 --> 00:36:45,690
Laughlin, we're getting off this route.
Turn left on 14th Street.

379
00:36:54,491 --> 00:36:58,495
- Officer McClane.
- It's Detective McClane, asshole.

380
00:36:58,578 --> 00:37:03,793
Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to get
to know each other when I visit you in prison.

381
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:07,213
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

382
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:09,423
Your address in Brooklyn,

383
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:14,178
the payments on your mortgage, how long
you've been a member of the NYPD.

384
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:16,013
And how's Holly?

385
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:20,351
That's sad. You're divorced.
Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?

386
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:28,442
Now, this is sad. After 30 years I thought
you'd have a better pension plan annuity.

387
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:30,653
And it gets worse.

388
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:36,033
Your 401k no longer exists.

389
00:37:36,117 --> 00:37:40,538
- Tell you what. Let me make it up to you.
- Box them in at that intersection.

390
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:43,708
Shoot Mr Farrell in the head
and drive away,

391
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:46,502
and by the time you reach
the end of the next block

392
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:52,174
all your debts will be wiped clean
and your children will be set for life.

393
00:37:52,258 --> 00:37:55,845
Now, that really is tempting,
especially that last part,

394
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:59,056
but I think I'm gonna have to pass, jerk-off.

395
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:04,395
John, you're a Timex watch in a digital age.

396
00:38:04,478 --> 00:38:06,314
You're gonna lose.

397
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:10,276
Yeah, well, the other thing that could
happen is I could come and find you,

398
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:13,946
kick your ass and throw you out of
your own party. What about that?

399
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,325
Hold your position.

400
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,746
He's not responding.

401
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:26,293
Get down. Get right down.

402
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:32,883
Just stay down.

403
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:40,432
Officers down at the corner of
Main and Constitution. Officers down.

404
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,827
Come on, come on, get out. Let's go.

405
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:06,041
Goddammit. Just stay down!

406
00:39:11,546 --> 00:39:13,840
Get down. Just hang on.

407
00:39:24,017 --> 00:39:27,938
Base, we've got a squad car under fire.
We need backup.

408
00:39:28,021 --> 00:39:30,692
This is base. We're sending backup.

409
00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:37,490
Just brace yourself.

410
00:39:52,714 --> 00:39:53,840
Hang on.

411
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:12,150
Hang on.

412
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,536
Yeah!

413
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:31,711
- We lost the tail.
- Stay with them.

414
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,931
- They're back.
- I know.

415
00:40:46,101 --> 00:40:47,686
Take the tunnel. Left.

416
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,778
God, what are you... Oh, God!

417
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,747
Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.

418
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,374
The tunnel!

419
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:21,387
Open the gates on the north side entrance.

420
00:41:27,476 --> 00:41:29,478
Redirect traffic to occupy all lanes.

421
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,331
- Now open the other side.
- What?

422
00:41:49,415 --> 00:41:50,708
Move.

423
00:41:54,962 --> 00:41:56,338
Hang onto something.

424
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:36,671
Don't get out of the car. Don't...

425
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,680
Just stay there. Stand still.

426
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:58,068
Run. Run.

427
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,201
Oh, God.

428
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:13,542
Don't hesitate like that again.

429
00:43:13,626 --> 00:43:15,461
Can you help me get my wife...

430
00:43:15,544 --> 00:43:18,005
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

431
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:22,134
- You OK?
- I can't move my arms.

432
00:43:22,218 --> 00:43:25,429
- Just stay here. Stay right here for a minute.
- What?

433
00:43:25,513 --> 00:43:28,182
"It can't be a uniform, John. No."

434
00:43:28,933 --> 00:43:32,812
Get over to the wall, sir.
"Feds called in a favour."

435
00:43:34,272 --> 00:43:40,111
"All you gotta do is go pick up a kid
down in Jersey, drive him down to DC."

436
00:43:40,194 --> 00:43:44,657
"How hard can that be?
It can't be that hard, can it?"

437
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,452
"No, gotta be a senior detective."

438
00:43:52,582 --> 00:43:56,836
Think a traffic jam,
throwing a car at me's gonna stop me?

439
00:43:56,919 --> 00:43:59,088
Rand, get in there and get it done.

440
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:01,132
WE DON'T HAVE TO. HE'S COMING TO US.

441
00:44:13,227 --> 00:44:15,479
This is not a good idea.

442
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:56,521
- Don't touch me, don't touch me.
- OK, sorry, sorry.

443
00:44:56,605 --> 00:44:58,857
Are you OK? Oh, my God.

444
00:45:01,652 --> 00:45:05,364
- Pretty lucky shot.
- Yeah, lucky. That was...

445
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:07,699
You just killed a helicopter with a car.

446
00:45:07,783 --> 00:45:09,910
I was out of bullets.

447
00:45:12,788 --> 00:45:16,833
- How you doin'
- I skinned my knee, my asthma's acting up...

448
00:45:18,335 --> 00:45:23,799
- Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Give me a hand. Don't jump outta cars.

449
00:45:33,392 --> 00:45:35,477
Rand, check in.

450
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,980
THE CHOPPER'S DOWN.

451
00:45:38,063 --> 00:45:40,775
What about Farrell and McClane?

452
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:42,902
THEY'R E HISTORY.

453
00:45:43,236 --> 00:45:44,362
Come back in.

454
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:46,573
OK, we're moving on. Begin stage three.

455
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:50,118
I just spoke to Emerson.
The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.

456
00:45:50,201 --> 00:45:54,581
Very good. Mai, get ready for the downloads.

457
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:03,506
ID, sir.

458
00:46:04,048 --> 00:46:06,384
Park behind the transpo. We'll lead you in.

459
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:08,886
Man the gate. You're with me.

460
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:21,524
Anthrax alarms only went off on five floors.
Below that you'll need DOD clearance.

461
00:46:21,608 --> 00:46:25,778
I don't know why you'd need to go further.
There's nothin' down there but servers.

462
00:46:31,618 --> 00:46:35,496
Go again. Rodriguez. I didn't copy.

463
00:46:50,303 --> 00:46:52,096
- Gate secured.
- Copy.

464
00:47:01,857 --> 00:47:02,942
OK, we are in.

465
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:39,019
This is insane.

466
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:42,064
This is absurd.

467
00:47:42,147 --> 00:47:47,486
Man, there's tough and there's stupid.
You gotta go to a hospital. Look at you.

468
00:47:48,028 --> 00:47:50,114
I'm not a doctor, but you're hurt.

469
00:47:50,197 --> 00:47:52,199
- Yeah. Sexy, right?
- No.

470
00:47:52,283 --> 00:47:53,576
Come on.

471
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:56,203
We don't need a doctor.
We need the cops.

472
00:48:24,566 --> 00:48:26,943
He's in.

473
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:29,821
Get outta the way.
Make a hole, please. Come on.

474
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:34,451
Watch out. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Come on.

475
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:37,621
NYPD. All right? I got this kid.
Come on. Let's go, kid.

476
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:44,961
Excuse me. Thanks.

477
00:48:45,045 --> 00:48:47,464
NYPD. NYPD.

478
00:48:47,547 --> 00:48:49,633
Coming through.

479
00:48:49,716 --> 00:48:50,926
Sergeant?

480
00:48:51,009 --> 00:48:54,012
Sergeant. I need to speak to you.

481
00:48:54,095 --> 00:48:59,017
- The medic's in the back.
- I'm all right. NYPD. I need to talk to you.

482
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,478
Just give me a minute.

483
00:49:01,561 --> 00:49:03,897
Sergeant.

484
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,402
Oh, my God.

485
00:49:15,283 --> 00:49:17,869
Let's get outta here.

486
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:33,427
We're a go.

487
00:49:33,511 --> 00:49:35,596
Launch the downloads.

488
00:49:45,189 --> 00:49:48,025
- Nothing's happening.
- Be patient.

489
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:53,573
- I don't know. It's not responding.
- Wait for it.

490
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:01,080
See? There you go.

491
00:50:02,873 --> 00:50:05,793
- Tell me when the download reaches 20%.
- OK.

492
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,298
I need you to please remain calm.

493
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,094
Excuse me.

494
00:50:16,137 --> 00:50:20,308
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Holy shit.

495
00:50:20,391 --> 00:50:22,643
- Kid? Kid, hey.
- Yeah, yeah.

496
00:50:22,727 --> 00:50:25,271
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yeah.

497
00:50:25,354 --> 00:50:27,356
Come on. Let's go.

498
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:35,073
And here you go, Agent Tovarek.
Guess that's you.

499
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,015
- Download's at 20%.
- Time to move.

500
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:03,185
Let's keep them chasing their tails.

501
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:22,996
Due to recent activity, law enforcement
agencies are being cautious.

502
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,542
They are telling drivers to abandon
their vehicles until they are searched.

503
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:31,630
And, as you can see,
canine units are checking each vehicle.

504
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:35,175
Whether this is connected to
the anthrax reports we heard earlier

505
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,636
or a new terrorist threat, we do not know...

506
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:40,138
- FAAjust grounded all flights.
- Good.

507
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:45,769
We have complete access over networks -
phones, power grids, water, nuclear.

508
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:48,063
- Excuse me.
- Jack Parry, NSA.

509
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:51,901
Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.
White House made the call.

510
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:55,905
- Anything you need, we're here to help.
- Help? Wow, that's great.

511
00:51:55,989 --> 00:52:00,743
We're gonna need some work space
for our people. What can you do for us?

512
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:06,082
As you can see, we're using the space, so
you guys can stand in the corner and liaise.

513
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:09,377
If I need something, I'll just wave to you.

514
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:34,819
- Wait. No, don't call.
- What are you talkin' about?

515
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:38,615
They probably cracked that hours ago.
They could trace us. Put it away.

516
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,491
- You sure?
- Yes.

517
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,828
Or smash it. You didn't have to smash it.

518
00:52:43,912 --> 00:52:46,664
Excuse me. It's a police emergency.

519
00:52:46,748 --> 00:52:49,792
He'll call you right back.

520
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:52,629
Here, right in here. Come here.

521
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:54,547
- You got a signal?
- Yeah.

522
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:59,302
- Yeah.
- This is John McClane for Agent Bowman.

523
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,679
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

524
00:53:03,015 --> 00:53:05,267
- McClane, go.
- We never made it to DHS.

525
00:53:05,351 --> 00:53:08,145
They came after the kid again.
All your men are down.

526
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:13,609
- What about Farrell?
- I got him with me right now.

527
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:15,778
- Sir?
- Hang on, John.

528
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:17,947
Yeah, I'll hold on.

529
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:24,161
Another day in paradise.

530
00:53:24,245 --> 00:53:29,458
They just swarmed into everything -
the telecom system, phones, cells, satellites.

531
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:44,390
They're blanketing every station.

532
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:14,920
- Can you put the news back on?
- This is the news. It's on every channel.

533
00:54:15,004 --> 00:54:19,134
Been this way for a few minutes now.

534
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:36,443
Oh, my God.

535
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:46,077
McClane.

536
00:54:46,995 --> 00:54:48,121
Look out.

537
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:49,789
Look out.

538
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,584
Look out.

539
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,379
Bowman? Bowman, do you see that?

540
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:58,798
Bowman, it's a fake.

541
00:55:02,928 --> 00:55:04,596
I see it.

542
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:07,474
Thank God.

543
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:10,769
Shit.

544
00:55:10,852 --> 00:55:12,687
- McClane?
- Bowman.

545
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:20,737
Satellite's down. Get me a land line.

546
00:55:36,045 --> 00:55:41,509
I wrote one little piece of code and the
world falls apart. This is virtual terrorism.

547
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:43,719
- What?
- You know, it's crazy.

548
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:46,514
The first time I heard of the concept
of a fire sale

549
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:50,601
I actually thought it would be cool
if anyone ever really did it.

550
00:55:50,685 --> 00:55:56,482
Just hit the reset button
and melt the system just for fun.

551
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:59,986
It's not a system. It's a country.

552
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:03,364
You're talkin' about people,
a whole country full of people,

553
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:06,993
sitting at home alone, scared to death
in their houses, all right?

554
00:56:07,076 --> 00:56:13,332
So finish your nostalgic moment and think
a little bit and help me catch these guys.

555
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:17,420
Just help me.
Just put yourself in their shoes.

556
00:56:18,546 --> 00:56:22,300
Come on. If this were your fire sale,
what would be your next move?

557
00:56:22,383 --> 00:56:28,180
OK, well, the whole point of a fire sale
is that it's mostly done by remote, right?

558
00:56:28,264 --> 00:56:33,269
But not everything is run completely online.
Major utilities aren't.

559
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:37,231
They're run by closed circuits,
so you could breach the security,

560
00:56:37,315 --> 00:56:41,485
but to shut it down you'd have to
physically go there. You'd have to show up.

561
00:56:41,569 --> 00:56:43,404
And...

562
00:56:44,323 --> 00:56:46,867
- Give me that guy's PDA.
- Phones are all dead.

563
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:52,539
No, it's the network that's dead. I've just gotta
reprogram it and link it into the old Satcoms.

564
00:56:52,623 --> 00:56:57,210
Hackers surf 'em all the time. Probably what
these guys are using to talk to each other.

565
00:56:57,294 --> 00:56:59,046
How do you know all this stuff?

566
00:56:59,129 --> 00:57:03,467
Dude, I don't know. There's a lot
rattling around up there. I couldn't tell you.

567
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:06,303
OK. National power grid.

568
00:57:06,386 --> 00:57:09,932
Gas and electric is divided into three zones -
Eastern, Central, Western -

569
00:57:10,015 --> 00:57:12,559
each with a primary hub.

570
00:57:12,643 --> 00:57:14,728
Here it is.

571
00:57:15,896 --> 00:57:18,690
- What are we looking at?
- That is the Eastern hub.

572
00:57:18,774 --> 00:57:24,279
Now, they take this out, wipes out all
the power for the entire Eastern Corridor.

573
00:57:24,363 --> 00:57:26,823
But, again, you'd have to do it manually.

574
00:57:26,907 --> 00:57:31,870
- OK. Come on. Let's go.
- What? To West Virginia?

575
00:57:31,954 --> 00:57:35,958
I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me. McClane.

576
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:38,335
- You get used to it.
- McClane. Shit.

577
00:57:38,418 --> 00:57:43,048
Sir, wireless networks are down
and I think they're hitting the land lines, too.

578
00:57:43,131 --> 00:57:46,260
I don't care how, you find me a line.

579
00:57:46,343 --> 00:57:49,638
- Come on, what you got?
- We swept the building. Seems clean.

580
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:54,393
- We can sweep it again...
- Don't bother. Don't bother.

581
00:57:54,476 --> 00:57:57,813
It's a fake. This guy's playin' us.

582
00:57:57,896 --> 00:58:00,567
OK, get everyone back inside
the crisis centre now.

583
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,360
OK, let's open it up.

584
00:58:05,196 --> 00:58:07,865
- Come on, get in.
- Door's locked.

585
00:58:08,741 --> 00:58:12,495
Unless you have an extra gun
I can use to unlock it.

586
00:58:13,955 --> 00:58:17,166
Don't do that. You're gonna disable it.

587
00:58:18,418 --> 00:58:19,877
Jesus Christ!

588
00:58:21,296 --> 00:58:23,256
That was crazy. Did you see that?

589
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:27,594
Sorry about that, man.
I didn't know it'd come out so fast.

590
00:58:28,803 --> 00:58:32,223
Man, this is a pain in the ass.
How'd you do yours?

591
00:58:35,393 --> 00:58:38,479
You all right? What? Did it hit you a little bit?

592
00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:40,481
Sorry.

593
00:58:43,443 --> 00:58:47,780
No, please don't touch those, OK?
I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.

594
00:58:47,864 --> 00:58:50,700
I mean, I've read about it.

595
00:58:50,783 --> 00:58:53,828
RoadAssist. We've detected
an air-bag deployment.

596
00:58:53,912 --> 00:58:58,458
Yes. Please, we just hit a tree
and my dad is having a heart attack.

597
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:01,002
I think he's gonna die. You need to help us.

598
00:59:01,085 --> 00:59:03,880
Hold while we contact emergency services.

599
00:59:03,963 --> 00:59:09,052
No, no. He's dying. I can get him
to a hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.

600
00:59:09,135 --> 00:59:14,183
But I can't really turn the key, so you gotta
start the car for us, OK? Please, Dad...

601
00:59:14,266 --> 00:59:16,894
- Your name, please?
- I'm...

602
00:59:17,645 --> 00:59:20,856
My name is... Frank,

603
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:25,653
and my dad's name is... is...

604
00:59:26,987 --> 00:59:30,241
Dvorak Tsajanski.

605
00:59:31,575 --> 00:59:35,412
Please... Please, just help us.
We need your help. Please.

606
00:59:35,496 --> 00:59:37,706
Emergency services are on their way.

607
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:40,584
No, no, listen to me.
Ma'am, what is your name?

608
00:59:40,668 --> 00:59:42,378
- Dolores.
- Dolores?

609
00:59:42,461 --> 00:59:45,714
OK, Dolores, I don't know
if you have a dad, but I do,

610
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:48,133
and I wanna be able to say that
a year from now.

611
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:52,221
Because my dad is my hero,
and right now he is in my arms dying,

612
00:59:52,304 --> 00:59:56,558
and his only hope is to get to a hospital
right now. We can't wait.

613
00:59:56,642 --> 00:59:58,978
So please start the goddamn car.

614
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,234
Thank you, Dolores.

615
01:00:05,317 --> 01:00:07,778
Pass the PDA. I gotta call the Warlock.

616
01:00:07,861 --> 01:00:11,448
- The what?
- The Warlock. A digital Jedi. He's amazing.

617
01:00:29,217 --> 01:00:33,013
- Ma'am, you're not authorised to be here.
- FBI. We suspect a security breach.

618
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,890
You can't land here without authorisa...

619
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:58,163
That was pretty good back there, kid.

620
01:00:58,246 --> 01:00:59,789
Thanks.

621
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:03,585
What's the matter with you?
Nothing else to complain about?

622
01:01:03,668 --> 01:01:06,171
No. I'm just...

623
01:01:06,254 --> 01:01:10,967
- Well, what? What's the matter with you?
- I'm not like you. I can't do this shit.

624
01:01:11,051 --> 01:01:13,595
What's that mean? Like what?

625
01:01:13,678 --> 01:01:18,433
I'm not, like, heroic and everything.
I'm not brave like you are.

626
01:01:18,516 --> 01:01:21,227
- I'm not that guy.
- I'm nobody's hero, kid.

627
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:23,939
You've saved my life, like,
ten times in six hours.

628
01:01:24,022 --> 01:01:27,234
Just doing my job, that's all.

629
01:01:28,777 --> 01:01:33,657
Know what you get for being a hero?
Nothing. You get shot at.

630
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,827
You get a little pat on the back,
blah-blah-blah. Attaboy.

631
01:01:40,456 --> 01:01:42,708
You get divorced.

632
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:45,878
A wife that can't remember your last name.

633
01:01:45,962 --> 01:01:48,381
Your kids don't wanna talk to you.

634
01:01:49,632 --> 01:01:52,802
You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.

635
01:01:52,885 --> 01:01:56,472
Trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy.

636
01:01:57,014 --> 01:02:00,977
- Then why are you doin' this?
- Cos there's nobody else to do it right now.

637
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:04,146
If there was somebody else to do it,
I would let them do it.

638
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:07,191
But there's not. So we're doin' it.

639
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:11,404
And that's what makes you that guy.

640
01:02:20,288 --> 01:02:22,290
Thing's flying now.

641
01:02:22,373 --> 01:02:25,293
Contact Emerson.
Tell him we'll be there soon.

642
01:02:31,966 --> 01:02:35,678
What the hell are you doing?
This whole floor's restricted acc...

643
01:03:00,287 --> 01:03:02,831
Stay here.

644
01:03:31,735 --> 01:03:33,820
All right, come on.

645
01:03:52,339 --> 01:03:55,300
- We're in.
- Good. Shut it down.

646
01:04:05,811 --> 01:04:08,022
Guess you were right, kid.

647
01:04:08,106 --> 01:04:11,359
OK, that's awful.

648
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:14,862
We got company.

649
01:04:23,746 --> 01:04:26,165
- How would they shut down a power grid?
- What?

650
01:04:26,249 --> 01:04:30,378
- Come on.
- Central control room. OK...

651
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:35,133
- Fourth floor. Fourth floor.
- Come on.

652
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:40,138
You take the right.

653
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:46,019
Shit.

654
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:50,607
- Can we stop for...
- Try to keep up.

655
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:53,860
I am. I just wanna stop for two seconds
to catch our breath.

656
01:04:53,943 --> 01:04:57,363
You know, they have these things
called gymnasiums.

657
01:05:18,217 --> 01:05:20,845
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

658
01:05:33,108 --> 01:05:35,819
Intel's fairly certain the terrorists are mobile.

659
01:05:35,903 --> 01:05:38,781
It's the only way
to avoid signal triangulation.

660
01:05:38,864 --> 01:05:41,283
With the amount of hardware they're running,

661
01:05:41,367 --> 01:05:46,038
we're probably looking for a large vehicle,
most likely a semitrailer rig.

662
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:48,832
All right. Tell the guys at Homeland Security

663
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:52,836
we need every agent, satellite
and functioning network they got. Now.

664
01:06:12,231 --> 01:06:13,941
Play time's over, sweetheart.

665
01:06:14,024 --> 01:06:15,192
Don't.

666
01:06:15,276 --> 01:06:17,778
Take your hand off the gun. Hands up.

667
01:06:18,529 --> 01:06:20,614
Stand up.

668
01:06:26,745 --> 01:06:29,164
Go on. Now.

669
01:06:29,248 --> 01:06:32,001
Let's go, kid. You're up.

670
01:06:32,084 --> 01:06:33,752
OK...

671
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:36,965
As fast as you can.

672
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:41,136
Jesus!

673
01:06:57,944 --> 01:07:00,030
That's enough of this kung fu shit.

674
01:07:00,113 --> 01:07:04,534
I've known some bitches in my day,
but you are maybe the...

675
01:07:09,664 --> 01:07:11,666
Still awake?

676
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:14,002
- Just keep doin' what you're doin'
- OK.

677
01:07:14,085 --> 01:07:16,630
- How much time do you need?
- Not much.

678
01:07:30,018 --> 01:07:32,604
- Are you done?
- I...

679
01:07:32,687 --> 01:07:34,606
- Are you done?
- No, not quite.

680
01:07:34,689 --> 01:07:37,692
- What?
- I'm not exactly checking my email here.

681
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:42,489
They used VM mode, so I'm isolating
their API and booting the host.

682
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:45,951
- What?
- It means about 30 seconds, OK?

683
01:07:46,034 --> 01:07:48,411
Not the easiest thing to do when...

684
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:02,843
OK...

685
01:08:03,761 --> 01:08:05,972
Undo everything you just did. Now.

686
01:08:06,055 --> 01:08:08,266
OK. OK, OK.

687
01:08:09,016 --> 01:08:13,229
I'm a righty, I'm a righty.
I need my other hand, I really do.

688
01:08:14,146 --> 01:08:15,606
I'm a righty.

689
01:08:49,015 --> 01:08:51,892
One last door to open.

690
01:08:51,976 --> 01:08:55,980
Do you know what you're doing? Do you
realise what this'll do to the country?

691
01:08:56,063 --> 01:09:00,151
Yes, I do. Now open the door.

692
01:09:00,234 --> 01:09:03,780
OK, good. Glad we're on the same page.

693
01:09:10,245 --> 01:09:13,123
You do? I'm glad you know.

694
01:09:28,972 --> 01:09:30,933
How you doin'

695
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,610
Hang on.

696
01:10:54,892 --> 01:10:57,979
Listen, let's just talk about this
for one second.

697
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:05,612
How you doin'
That's not too tight, is it?

698
01:11:08,615 --> 01:11:10,575
Damn it.

699
01:11:12,535 --> 01:11:14,579
Smile pretty.

700
01:11:48,364 --> 01:11:49,490
McClane!

701
01:11:51,784 --> 01:11:53,577
Shit.

702
01:11:54,203 --> 01:11:56,789
McClane, get out of there.

703
01:11:57,957 --> 01:12:00,209
Come on, man. Come on.

704
01:12:03,629 --> 01:12:06,340
Come on, man.

705
01:12:26,485 --> 01:12:28,153
Did you see that?

706
01:12:32,074 --> 01:12:34,076
So you stopped it, right?

707
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:37,538
You know, a gun to your head
makes it harder to do this kind of work.

708
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:41,041
- What?
- I know that comes as a surprise.

709
01:12:43,919 --> 01:12:47,340
- Can't you just turn it off? Lock 'em out?
- I'm not sure.

710
01:12:49,676 --> 01:12:52,470
I might be able to slow 'em down, though.

711
01:12:54,306 --> 01:12:58,602
Western and Central hubs are ours.
We're just waiting on Mai's end.

712
01:12:58,685 --> 01:13:02,397
Hang on. Something's up.
All the security's reactivating.

713
01:13:03,565 --> 01:13:08,612
I think someone might be in the market
for some cheap Viagra.

714
01:13:08,695 --> 01:13:13,491
Now your girlfriend's dead,
why don't you check out our sexy singles?

715
01:13:14,242 --> 01:13:16,036
It's an e-bomb.

716
01:13:28,298 --> 01:13:29,799
All right, wait, wait.

717
01:13:33,595 --> 01:13:36,139
- Mai, talk to me. What's going on?
- Mai?

718
01:13:37,098 --> 01:13:41,144
Yeah - little Asian chick, likes to kick people?

719
01:13:41,227 --> 01:13:45,106
I don't think she's gonna be talking
to anybody for a really long time.

720
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:50,612
Last time I saw her, she was at the bottom
of an elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.

721
01:13:51,488 --> 01:13:54,532
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

722
01:13:54,616 --> 01:13:58,161
Listen, jackass. Your fire sale is over.

723
01:13:59,997 --> 01:14:04,460
Just pack up your little circus or I'm gonna
come and I'm gonna kick your ass.

724
01:14:04,543 --> 01:14:10,675
You have no idea who I am
or what I'm capable of.

725
01:14:10,758 --> 01:14:13,427
When I'm finished here -
and I promise it'll be soon -

726
01:14:13,511 --> 01:14:17,306
I will focus all my attention on you.

727
01:14:18,599 --> 01:14:21,394
You wanna make things personal, fine.

728
01:14:41,455 --> 01:14:46,919
Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas
in the pipelines to that station.

729
01:14:47,503 --> 01:14:52,133
- Can you get Bowman on this thing?
- Sure. I can get anyone on it.

730
01:14:52,216 --> 01:14:53,384
Do it.

731
01:14:53,467 --> 01:14:55,344
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

732
01:14:58,973 --> 01:15:00,933
Please, no.

733
01:15:01,892 --> 01:15:03,853
- It's Thomas Gabriel.
- Shit.

734
01:15:05,563 --> 01:15:08,816
- You know this guy?
- I worked with him.

735
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:12,446
He was DOD's chief programmer
for infrastructure security.

736
01:15:12,529 --> 01:15:16,575
After 9/11, he's the guy that told
Joint Chiefs the system was vulnerable.

737
01:15:16,658 --> 01:15:20,787
He wanted an overhaul, but they wouldn't
listen. Gabriel's not people-friendly.

738
01:15:20,871 --> 01:15:22,497
You think so?

739
01:15:22,581 --> 01:15:25,792
When he tried to go public,
they crucified him.

740
01:15:25,876 --> 01:15:30,088
Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.
After that he disappeared.

741
01:15:30,172 --> 01:15:32,591
We got a pretty serious problem.

742
01:15:32,674 --> 01:15:34,843
Hold on one minute.
What?

743
01:15:34,927 --> 01:15:38,972
I think we need to get out of here right now.

744
01:15:39,056 --> 01:15:42,601
- They're sending the gas lines here.
- Gas lines? What gas lines?

745
01:15:42,684 --> 01:15:43,810
Christ.

746
01:15:45,562 --> 01:15:49,566
All of them. See that,
those flashing arrows? That's not good.

747
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:53,195
- All that's coming here?
- Yeah. I think we gotta go.

748
01:15:53,278 --> 01:15:56,698
Listen, I gotta go. Just find Thomas Gabriel.

749
01:15:56,782 --> 01:15:59,201
McClane? McClane?

750
01:15:59,284 --> 01:16:01,620
Let's go. Finish this up.

751
01:16:07,209 --> 01:16:10,587
Right now. Finish it up, come on. Let's go.

752
01:16:29,774 --> 01:16:31,276
Get in there.

753
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,158
You OK?

754
01:17:23,786 --> 01:17:27,916
- Let's go. We gotta get outta here.
- What is the point? Man, what is the point?

755
01:17:27,999 --> 01:17:30,293
Knock that off, come on.

756
01:17:30,376 --> 01:17:35,965
This has something to do with that code you
wrote for them. Think. Come on, help us win.

757
01:17:36,049 --> 01:17:39,802
Win? When do we start winning?

758
01:17:39,886 --> 01:17:44,224
Look around. Are you out of your mind?
Does it look like we're close to winning?

759
01:17:44,308 --> 01:17:46,810
We just got the shit kicked out of us.

760
01:17:46,894 --> 01:17:48,979
You think I'm holding out on you?

761
01:17:49,063 --> 01:17:53,067
If I knew what they wanted, I would tell you.
I would happily tell you.

762
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:55,527
Jesus.

763
01:18:31,772 --> 01:18:34,775
The Warlock. The Warlock.

764
01:18:34,858 --> 01:18:37,903
Great. There goes the cellphone.

765
01:18:37,987 --> 01:18:41,615
- They knocked satellites out of the skies?
- No, your battery ran out.

766
01:18:41,699 --> 01:18:43,492
- We should go see him.
- Who?

767
01:18:43,576 --> 01:18:46,370
The Warlock. We should drive
to his house in Baltimore.

768
01:18:46,453 --> 01:18:50,249
- Can't go to the Warlock's house now.
- This is me helping you.

769
01:18:50,332 --> 01:18:55,714
OK? Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock.
That's our only hope.

770
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:04,097
- How do you feel about flying?
- About what? Like, with a pilot?

771
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:14,399
- Just stick it in the round thing.
- What brown thing?

772
01:19:14,482 --> 01:19:17,277
Here, put these on.

773
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,946
Just stick it in there. That'll work.

774
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:24,034
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.

775
01:19:24,117 --> 01:19:26,578
- I used to be terrified of flying.
- Really?

776
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:30,123
Yeah. I took some lessons.
Face your fears, that kind of thing.

777
01:19:30,206 --> 01:19:33,168
- Yeah? Did it help?
- Not really.

778
01:19:38,048 --> 01:19:41,009
- Is it supposed to make that sound?
- Yeah.

779
01:19:42,636 --> 01:19:47,140
- Maybe we should just drive.
- Take it easy. Taking off's the hardest part.

780
01:19:47,223 --> 01:19:48,767
Really? I heard...

781
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:53,355
- To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.
- Ha, ha, ha. You did? Really?

782
01:19:53,438 --> 01:19:57,859
But you have your licence, right?
I mean, you can fly one of these things?

783
01:19:57,943 --> 01:20:01,529
- Oh, God.
- Here we go. We're up.

784
01:20:01,613 --> 01:20:03,490
Oh, God.

785
01:20:07,786 --> 01:20:10,665
That's good. That's pretty good.

786
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:15,044
Jesus, look at that.
This whole area's blacked out.

787
01:20:17,171 --> 01:20:19,465
How we gonna find Warlock's house?

788
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:22,760
It's probably gonna be
the one with the lights still on.

789
01:20:30,685 --> 01:20:35,982
Power outage keeps spreading. About half
the East Coast has already gone down.

790
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:39,568
All right. Put everything
on emergency generators.

791
01:20:39,652 --> 01:20:42,154
How the hell are they getting past us?

792
01:20:45,866 --> 01:20:47,994
OK. Down there, down there. I see it.

793
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:49,787
- Down there?
- Left. Down.

794
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:56,669
What? Are we gonna land down there?

795
01:20:58,462 --> 01:21:00,423
- All right, hang on.
- OK, OK.

796
01:21:03,593 --> 01:21:05,428
Fence. Fence. Fence.

797
01:21:07,888 --> 01:21:09,557
- Fence. Fence.
- I see it.

798
01:21:10,224 --> 01:21:11,642
Watch...

799
01:21:23,655 --> 01:21:25,574
- Oh, Jesus.
- Come on.

800
01:21:25,657 --> 01:21:29,119
Yeah, yeah. "Taking off's the hardest part."

801
01:21:29,202 --> 01:21:30,162
Let's go.

802
01:21:33,332 --> 01:21:38,253
Now, there's something you need to know
about Warlock. He hates cops, OK?

803
01:21:38,337 --> 01:21:41,632
So just let me do all the talking, OK?

804
01:21:50,432 --> 01:21:52,351
Shit.

805
01:21:52,434 --> 01:21:54,728
Hey, Mrs Kaludis.

806
01:21:54,811 --> 01:21:56,480
Is Freddy home?

807
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,485
I'm Matt Farrell and this is...

808
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:03,362
Billy.

809
01:22:03,445 --> 01:22:08,367
We're friends from Space Camp.
I went to Space Camp with Freddy.

810
01:22:09,868 --> 01:22:11,828
Freddy!

811
01:22:11,912 --> 01:22:14,581
- Freddy?
- You got company.

812
01:22:21,046 --> 01:22:24,216
Frederick. Didn't you hear me?

813
01:22:24,299 --> 01:22:26,343
All Baltimore heard you, Ma.

814
01:22:26,426 --> 01:22:29,638
- Your friends are here.
- Friends? What the?

815
01:22:30,264 --> 01:22:34,309
Come on, Ma. How many times I gotta
tell you, don't bring people down here?

816
01:22:34,393 --> 01:22:39,357
I can't see too good. Is that a young, bearded
Han Solo? You've lost so much weight.

817
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,694
No, I gained 30 pounds. Who is that?
Know what? Doesn't matter.

818
01:22:42,777 --> 01:22:47,448
Dude, what are you doin' here? Cos of you,
I'm rocking five generators to stay online.

819
01:22:47,532 --> 01:22:53,913
And since you're being hunted by assassins,
this visit is not a healthy use of my time.

820
01:22:53,997 --> 01:22:56,916
And don't touch that, all right?

821
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,837
CB radio?
A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?

822
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:04,549
That, my friend, is an end-of-the-world
insurance system, OK?

823
01:23:04,632 --> 01:23:08,136
So when the last microchip goes down,
I can contact whoever's there,

824
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:10,430
whether they be zombies or not.

825
01:23:10,513 --> 01:23:14,767
- What'd you bring your dad here for?
- He's cool. He's into the gaming culture.

826
01:23:14,851 --> 01:23:17,020
Nice poster.

827
01:23:17,687 --> 01:23:23,484
- What? Like, you a big fan of the Fett?
- No. I was always more of a <i>Star Wars</i> guy.

828
01:23:24,193 --> 01:23:26,904
- <i>Star Wars</i> guy. Who is this man?
- He's my...

829
01:23:26,988 --> 01:23:29,407
Dump truck. I'm not his dad.

830
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:33,536
- I'm a cop. How 'bout that?
- A cop. I'm sorry. Thank you.

831
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:36,748
Why'd you bring a cop
into my command centre?

832
01:23:36,831 --> 01:23:39,208
Command centre. It's a basement.

833
01:23:39,292 --> 01:23:41,711
- It's a command centre.
- I can explain.

834
01:23:41,794 --> 01:23:45,673
Just tell us about Thomas Gabriel, all right?
That's why we came here.

835
01:23:45,757 --> 01:23:47,842
Thomas Gabriel. I didn't know. Sorry.

836
01:23:47,926 --> 01:23:50,262
Get out. I want you outta here, right now.

837
01:23:50,346 --> 01:23:53,599
Calm down. Just calm down, big boy.

838
01:23:53,682 --> 01:23:56,101
You calm down. It's my house.

839
01:23:56,185 --> 01:24:00,898
You're gonna tell me what I wanna know,
or I'll beat you to death in your own house.

840
01:24:15,329 --> 01:24:19,708
Four years ago, the DOD recruits Thomas
Gabriel to be a cyberspook for 'em, OK?

841
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:21,919
First day on the job, tells his bosses

842
01:24:22,002 --> 01:24:25,589
this nation's security infrastructure
is open to compromise.

843
01:24:25,673 --> 01:24:30,886
They say, "We'll take it under advisement."
But he don't ease up cos he is committed.

844
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:33,889
So he breaks into a meeting
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

845
01:24:33,973 --> 01:24:38,894
and, with just a laptop, hacks into NORAD
and shuts down our defence network.

846
01:24:38,978 --> 01:24:42,314
So they put a gun to the man's head
and forced him to stop the hack.

847
01:24:42,398 --> 01:24:46,568
Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down
NORAD with a laptop just to prove a point.

848
01:24:46,652 --> 01:24:49,405
- You think I'm scared of you?
- Tell us how to find him.

849
01:24:49,488 --> 01:24:52,658
How do I know? He's a ghost, man.
He just fell off the grid.

850
01:24:52,741 --> 01:24:54,952
- Another dead end. Come on.
- Wait.

851
01:24:55,035 --> 01:24:58,455
Listen, Warlock,
a couple of weeks ago I wrote a...

852
01:24:58,539 --> 01:25:04,170
A mutating algorithmic security code, that's
probably being used by Thomas Gabriel now.

853
01:25:04,254 --> 01:25:07,591
No, we know that. Yes.
Can you tell us what he's using it for?

854
01:25:07,674 --> 01:25:11,469
I don't know. I've been trying
to figure that out. Here, look.

855
01:25:11,553 --> 01:25:14,723
The only security system in the country
that I can find

856
01:25:14,806 --> 01:25:19,269
currently employing that template
is the Social Security Administration.

857
01:25:19,352 --> 01:25:24,733
But they don't use it in the main facility. Look.
They use it in this building, in Woodlawn.

858
01:25:24,816 --> 01:25:27,944
- Whoa. What the hell? God.
- I know, right?

859
01:25:28,028 --> 01:25:31,740
- What are you talkin' about?
- The power consumption's off the charts.

860
01:25:31,823 --> 01:25:35,535
- It's hot. It's on fire.
- Why are there chilling towers?

861
01:25:35,619 --> 01:25:36,995
Hello.

862
01:25:37,078 --> 01:25:39,581
What's a chilling tower?

863
01:25:39,664 --> 01:25:42,083
See what I've been dealing with?

864
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:45,754
Large server farms generate a lot of heat
and need to be cooled.

865
01:25:45,837 --> 01:25:47,255
But why there?

866
01:25:47,339 --> 01:25:52,177
I don't know what's in that building,
but it's not Social Security numbers.

867
01:25:57,682 --> 01:26:02,854
I got a red flag over here.
Someone's hackin' into Woodlawn.

868
01:26:03,688 --> 01:26:06,900
Honing in on the host server right now.

869
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:09,778
"Frederick Kaludis."

870
01:26:09,861 --> 01:26:12,030
- Let's have a look at him.
- Fat bastard.

871
01:26:17,035 --> 01:26:18,412
McClane.

872
01:26:18,496 --> 01:26:22,917
- Where is his daughter?
- We just got a trace on her cell.

873
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,585
You'll love this.

874
01:26:28,839 --> 01:26:31,467
All right. Let's get a better look at you.

875
01:26:43,604 --> 01:26:45,481
- Freddy?
- What?

876
01:26:45,564 --> 01:26:49,151
What the hell are you doing
dickin' around inside my network?

877
01:26:53,531 --> 01:26:55,324
McClane?

878
01:26:55,408 --> 01:26:57,326
I thought I killed you already.

879
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:59,412
I get that sometimes.

880
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:06,085
- You think you can try to track where he is?
- Dude, yeah.

881
01:27:06,168 --> 01:27:11,215
Detective, covering the camera with your
hand does not turn off the microphone.

882
01:27:12,508 --> 01:27:18,681
Yeah, I know I'm not as smart as you guys
with all this computer shit,

883
01:27:18,764 --> 01:27:22,435
but I'm still alive, ain't I?

884
01:27:23,311 --> 01:27:28,858
I mean, you got to be runnin' out
of bad guys by now, right?

885
01:27:31,528 --> 01:27:33,530
Gabriel?

886
01:27:35,115 --> 01:27:38,493
Honestly, you can tell me.
How does that work?

887
01:27:38,577 --> 01:27:43,373
You got some kind of service?
Some kinda 800 number? 1-800-HENCHMEN?

888
01:27:43,457 --> 01:27:45,834
And I bet you're still on hold with,

889
01:27:45,918 --> 01:27:51,465
"Can I get another dead Asian hooker bitch
over here right away?"

890
01:27:51,548 --> 01:27:57,554
But seriously, all that kicking aside, that
skinny little ninja chick, she was smokin' hot.

891
01:27:57,638 --> 01:28:00,933
One of those gotta be real hard
to come by, right?

892
01:28:01,016 --> 01:28:04,686
- You're impressed with yourself, aren't you?
- I have my moments.

893
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:06,605
Yeah?

894
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,359
Is this one of them?

895
01:28:14,821 --> 01:28:17,699
- Hello?
- Yes, this is Emergency Services.

896
01:28:17,783 --> 01:28:19,618
- Thank God.
- Can she hear me?

897
01:28:19,701 --> 01:28:23,413
My name is Lucy Gennero.
I'm stuck in here. My cell's not working.

898
01:28:23,497 --> 01:28:26,333
Can she hear this?
Lucy, hang up that phone.

899
01:28:26,416 --> 01:28:30,587
Yes, calm down, miss.
We know exactly where you are.

900
01:28:30,671 --> 01:28:32,547
Everything is gonna be all right.

901
01:28:32,631 --> 01:28:37,302
- Lucy, hang up the phone.
- John, I'm trying to have a conversation.

902
01:28:40,055 --> 01:28:43,058
We're a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,

903
01:28:43,141 --> 01:28:45,687
but I assure you
we're gonna get you out of there.

904
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:50,108
- Even if I have to come down there myself.
- Thank you.

905
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:53,778
In the meantime, is there anyone
we can contact for you?

906
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:55,571
Yeah.

907
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:58,616
My dad.

908
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:02,412
His name is John McClane.
He's a New York City cop.

909
01:29:03,079 --> 01:29:09,294
We'll find him. Just hang in there, miss,
and we'll get to you, very soon.

910
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:12,880
Thank you.

911
01:29:13,923 --> 01:29:18,761
Wow. That's a great girl you got there.
Can't wait to meet her.

912
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,806
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

913
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:23,975
Come on, John.

914
01:29:25,184 --> 01:29:27,729
Make ajoke.

915
01:29:27,812 --> 01:29:30,857
Say somethin' funny.

916
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:39,240
Where? Where you goin'

917
01:29:39,657 --> 01:29:44,245
McClane. Hold on.
Where you goin' What are you gonna do?

918
01:29:44,329 --> 01:29:48,541
What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
go kill this guy and get my daughter.

919
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:52,712
- But she can be anywhere...
- Listen. It's gonna get messy. Stay here.

920
01:29:52,795 --> 01:29:56,382
- I think I...
- I'm doing you a favour.

921
01:29:56,466 --> 01:29:58,885
I wouldn't bet on me, all right?

922
01:29:58,968 --> 01:30:00,971
I'll take it from here.

923
01:30:01,055 --> 01:30:03,474
Thanks for your help.

924
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:14,234
I wouldn't bet on you either,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.

925
01:30:16,028 --> 01:30:18,113
Buckle up.

926
01:30:44,014 --> 01:30:46,308
FBI, ma'am. Jersey field office.

927
01:30:46,392 --> 01:30:48,394
Mind if I see your ID?

928
01:30:48,477 --> 01:30:50,562
Not at all.

929
01:30:59,613 --> 01:31:01,991
My dad's a cop. Force of habit.

930
01:31:02,658 --> 01:31:06,120
Your father sounds like a very smart man.

931
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:12,918
Kid, can you get Bowman?

932
01:31:13,003 --> 01:31:15,088
Yeah.

933
01:31:24,723 --> 01:31:26,725
It's completely dead.

934
01:31:26,808 --> 01:31:30,437
Gabriel must have shut down
all the satellite links. Shit.

935
01:31:35,692 --> 01:31:38,194
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

936
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:42,991
About all of it.

937
01:31:43,074 --> 01:31:45,911
It was my fault you got into this.
This wasn't your fight.

938
01:31:45,994 --> 01:31:47,704
You got nothin' to be sorry about.

939
01:31:52,792 --> 01:31:55,795
- Let go of me, you bastard.
- This bitch is a handful.

940
01:32:01,801 --> 01:32:04,179
Are you gonna be all right?

941
01:32:06,348 --> 01:32:08,808
Behave or I will hurt you.

942
01:32:08,892 --> 01:32:13,980
Yeah? Let's step outside, just you and me.
We'll see who hurts who.

943
01:32:15,857 --> 01:32:18,193
You really are his daughter.

944
01:32:18,276 --> 01:32:19,945
Tie her wrists.

945
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:29,455
Trey, Gabriel wants to see you.

946
01:32:29,538 --> 01:32:32,083
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

947
01:32:33,376 --> 01:32:34,752
OK.

948
01:32:35,711 --> 01:32:38,464
I'll be back in a second.

949
01:32:43,302 --> 01:32:45,221
No, no, no, please.

950
01:33:30,349 --> 01:33:33,269
We're showing a breach on an exterior vent.

951
01:33:37,523 --> 01:33:39,942
Go take a look.

952
01:33:40,484 --> 01:33:42,738
Don't be long. We're packing up soon.

953
01:33:54,374 --> 01:33:58,086
McClane, do we have anything
resembling a plan?

954
01:33:58,170 --> 01:34:00,213
Find Lucy and kill everybody else.

955
01:34:00,297 --> 01:34:04,176
No, I mean more like a plan.
Like, a way to do that.

956
01:34:06,386 --> 01:34:08,388
Come on.

957
01:34:09,431 --> 01:34:15,687
OK, according to the layout, the chilling
towers are kept on the bottom level.

958
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:22,235
I think mine's locked.

959
01:34:25,906 --> 01:34:29,785
OK. Now it looks like
we're gettin' somewhere.

960
01:34:40,671 --> 01:34:46,051
OK, this looks like it controls the cooling
system for the mainframe, which should be...

961
01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:49,012
If I can just hack in,

962
01:34:50,722 --> 01:34:53,558
and trip the alarm, it might alert Bowman.

963
01:35:02,026 --> 01:35:03,820
Someone set off the alarms.

964
01:35:03,903 --> 01:35:08,032
Yes. Thank you, detective. I can hear that.
Find a way to turn it off.

965
01:35:12,203 --> 01:35:14,247
What have you got?

966
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:18,793
We got a problem.
The alarms went off at Woodlawn.

967
01:35:20,086 --> 01:35:22,005
It's gotta be him.

968
01:35:22,088 --> 01:35:24,299
And what's Woodlawn?

969
01:35:28,428 --> 01:35:32,515
It's NSA - a secure facility
outside of Baltimore.

970
01:35:32,599 --> 01:35:37,353
It's a fail-safe we built after 9/11
to back up all financial information.

971
01:35:37,437 --> 01:35:42,442
The moment networks were hit, all financial
data began downloading to those servers.

972
01:35:42,525 --> 01:35:47,614
Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,
government funds - all of it.

973
01:35:47,697 --> 01:35:51,534
Basically, a backup for
the accumulated wealth of America.

974
01:35:51,618 --> 01:35:54,037
All in one location?

975
01:35:55,163 --> 01:35:56,831
What could Gabriel do with it?

976
01:35:56,915 --> 01:36:00,877
If he could get in, he might try to transfer
the data to a portable hard drive.

977
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:06,841
Then he'd have access to those accounts from
anywhere. Siphon off billions for himself.

978
01:36:06,925 --> 01:36:08,510
We couldn't trace it.

979
01:36:08,594 --> 01:36:14,516
Or, knowing him, he could erase it all
and send us all back to the Stone Age.

980
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:19,980
- Why the hell wasn't I told about this?
- Frankly, it's above your pay grade.

981
01:36:20,064 --> 01:36:22,149
My pay grade?

982
01:36:24,485 --> 01:36:30,074
How the hell did Gabriel find out about this
when even I didn't know about it?

983
01:36:32,117 --> 01:36:34,245
He designed it.

984
01:36:35,788 --> 01:36:37,581
It was his program.

985
01:36:37,665 --> 01:36:42,962
He knew that hacking your system
last night would trigger the download.

986
01:36:43,045 --> 01:36:44,630
That's brilliant.

987
01:36:44,713 --> 01:36:48,592
You two geniuses, stay out of my way.

988
01:36:53,973 --> 01:36:57,726
Let me see if I can get a floor plan
of this place.

989
01:36:58,269 --> 01:37:00,229
Don't move.

990
01:37:00,312 --> 01:37:02,856
You, get away from the bag. Now.

991
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:04,566
OK, OK.

992
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:06,902
We've been waiting for you.

993
01:37:07,653 --> 01:37:11,031
Yeah? I've been waiting for you, too.

994
01:37:38,351 --> 01:37:40,186
McClane!

995
01:37:41,521 --> 01:37:43,023
McClane!

996
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:47,027
Kid?

997
01:37:47,444 --> 01:37:48,570
Matt?

998
01:37:48,653 --> 01:37:49,779
Kid.

999
01:38:03,168 --> 01:38:05,378
Emerson.

1000
01:38:06,296 --> 01:38:08,715
We have a problem in
one of the cooling towers.

1001
01:38:08,798 --> 01:38:10,175
- Tower seven.
- Tower seven.

1002
01:38:10,258 --> 01:38:12,969
Find out what's going on.

1003
01:38:21,811 --> 01:38:22,854
Sir?

1004
01:38:22,938 --> 01:38:25,649
Get the HR team to stand by.
We need to get to Woodlawn.

1005
01:38:25,732 --> 01:38:28,526
The roads out are blocked.
DC's in total gridlock.

1006
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,445
Then get us some helicopters.

1007
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:33,490
They were all pulled by the Pentagon
for search and rescue.

1008
01:38:33,573 --> 01:38:37,578
Molina, find me
some goddamn helicopters immediately.

1009
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:41,165
Look, the Pentagon
has jets flying CAP over DC.

1010
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:44,210
Have them send one to Woodlawn
and keep an eye on things.

1011
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:46,379
Let's go.

1012
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:59,600
Where's my daughter?

1013
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:02,103
Russo, check in.

1014
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:10,194
Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.

1015
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:13,656
Hold on a minute.
Looks like he's coming around.

1016
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:16,867
It's McClane. He's on the third floor.

1017
01:39:20,496 --> 01:39:23,749
Get all that? That's right.

1018
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:27,461
I'm on the third floor.
But I'm coming to get you.

1019
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,472
Don't move now. I'll send a doctor.

1020
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:44,228
Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.

1021
01:40:30,567 --> 01:40:32,444
My algorithm.

1022
01:40:38,492 --> 01:40:41,036
OK, please, God.

1023
01:40:41,495 --> 01:40:43,538
Please, God...

1024
01:41:19,659 --> 01:41:23,204
Jesus, they're going after the money.

1025
01:41:45,685 --> 01:41:48,605
You coming to get me, John?
Is that the plan?

1026
01:41:48,688 --> 01:41:50,898
Yep, that's my plan.

1027
01:41:50,982 --> 01:41:54,360
What makes you think I won't put a bullet
in your daughter's head?

1028
01:41:54,444 --> 01:41:57,739
- Cos you're scared of me.
- You think I'm afraid of you?

1029
01:41:58,448 --> 01:42:01,743
Otherwise she'd be dead already.
You need a bargaining chip.

1030
01:42:08,708 --> 01:42:11,461
Stop there. Hands up.

1031
01:42:11,544 --> 01:42:14,047
If you kill me, you'll never get it open.

1032
01:42:16,925 --> 01:42:19,178
Move away. Move.

1033
01:42:26,393 --> 01:42:30,481
You know, John, I feel like
we've gotten off on the wrong foot.

1034
01:42:30,564 --> 01:42:34,151
And because of that,
you think I'm the bad guy.

1035
01:42:34,234 --> 01:42:37,029
Nothing could be further from the truth.
I'm the good guy.

1036
01:42:37,112 --> 01:42:40,616
I told them this could happen
if they didn't prepare.

1037
01:42:40,699 --> 01:42:44,286
Did I get a thank-you?
No, I got crucified. But they wouldn't listen.

1038
01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:48,207
- You got their attention now, don't you?
- That's right.

1039
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:52,962
- I am doing the country a favour.
- By tearing it apart.

1040
01:42:53,045 --> 01:42:58,175
Better me than some outsider.
Some religious nut-job bent on Armageddon.

1041
01:42:58,259 --> 01:43:00,928
Nobody wants to see that happen.

1042
01:43:01,011 --> 01:43:07,268
Everything I've broken can be fixed
if the country is willing to pay for it.

1043
01:43:07,351 --> 01:43:10,646
Bullshit. It's always been about the money.

1044
01:43:10,729 --> 01:43:14,942
What? I shouldn't get paid for my work?
I'm working my ass off here, John.

1045
01:43:15,025 --> 01:43:18,696
Well, just sit tight, asshole.
I got a cheque for you.

1046
01:43:21,782 --> 01:43:26,578
I can't talk to this guy. You talk to him,
see if you can get him to focus.

1047
01:43:26,662 --> 01:43:27,705
Dad?

1048
01:43:30,708 --> 01:43:32,752
Hi, baby.

1049
01:43:32,836 --> 01:43:35,213
Now there are only five of them.

1050
01:43:37,674 --> 01:43:40,260
Hang on, Lucy. I'm comin'

1051
01:43:50,478 --> 01:43:54,107
Would somebody
please kill this son of a bitch?

1052
01:43:55,609 --> 01:43:57,569
We have a problem.

1053
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:02,324
There's actually no problem.
I just got off on the wrong floor.

1054
01:44:04,951 --> 01:44:07,037
This is a mess.

1055
01:44:08,955 --> 01:44:13,168
Wow. I'm truly impressed, man.
Hacking every byte of financial data

1056
01:44:13,251 --> 01:44:17,505
for the entire country'd take weeks
unless you eliminated the congestion.

1057
01:44:17,589 --> 01:44:20,759
That's what this fire sale is about, isn't it?

1058
01:44:20,842 --> 01:44:24,054
- That's brilliant.
- Yes, it is. Please be quiet.

1059
01:44:24,137 --> 01:44:26,640
- Asshole.
- Who are you?

1060
01:44:27,265 --> 01:44:28,808
Matt Farrell.

1061
01:44:29,643 --> 01:44:31,978
Lucy McClane.

1062
01:44:32,062 --> 01:44:35,523
I thought your name was Gennero.
Lucy Gennero.

1063
01:44:35,607 --> 01:44:37,400
Not today.

1064
01:44:37,484 --> 01:44:41,446
- Can you crack the code?
- Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.

1065
01:44:41,529 --> 01:44:43,782
That's encouraging.

1066
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:47,745
Take them with us.

1067
01:44:47,828 --> 01:44:49,956
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1068
01:44:52,541 --> 01:44:55,294
Gabriel, Pentagon just sent
an F-35 towards us.

1069
01:44:55,378 --> 01:44:57,463
Keep an eye on it.

1070
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:02,385
Pulling down the "go" codes now.

1071
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:21,612
You might wanna think about
what you want on your headstone, asshole.

1072
01:45:28,202 --> 01:45:30,913
Christ! Goddamn hamster.

1073
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:32,999
There you go.

1074
01:45:33,082 --> 01:45:35,543
Stay still, spider-boy.

1075
01:45:39,547 --> 01:45:41,340
That's right.

1076
01:46:10,412 --> 01:46:12,247
Goddammit!

1077
01:46:21,423 --> 01:46:22,591
Oh, no.

1078
01:46:25,052 --> 01:46:29,514
You probably shouldn't antagonise them,
since they have all the loaded guns.

1079
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:34,019
Take a minute and dig deep for a bigger
set of balls, cos you're gonna need 'em.

1080
01:46:34,102 --> 01:46:39,191
Wow. I know that tone. It's just weird
hearing it from someone... with hair.

1081
01:47:15,728 --> 01:47:16,896
Sir.

1082
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:18,856
ETA 15 minutes.

1083
01:47:43,548 --> 01:47:46,050
There we go.

1084
01:48:13,202 --> 01:48:14,954
Fix it.

1085
01:48:15,038 --> 01:48:18,374
Why? You're just gonna kill me if I fix it.
I know that.

1086
01:48:25,089 --> 01:48:26,758
Oh, shit!

1087
01:48:30,387 --> 01:48:32,806
I'm not gonna do it.

1088
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:40,314
- No, no, no. Shit.
- Robinson is coming pretty fast.

1089
01:48:40,397 --> 01:48:42,566
- I'm sorry, what?
- Something's wrong.

1090
01:48:42,650 --> 01:48:44,693
Robinson is coming too fast.

1091
01:48:49,073 --> 01:48:51,033
It's not Robinson.

1092
01:48:51,116 --> 01:48:53,118
That would be my dad.

1093
01:49:04,463 --> 01:49:06,590
Freddy?

1094
01:49:07,508 --> 01:49:09,301
Freddy?

1095
01:49:10,177 --> 01:49:11,971
It's John McClane.

1096
01:49:12,054 --> 01:49:15,599
Look, I know you can hear me.
This is your frequency, right? 666.

1097
01:49:15,683 --> 01:49:18,435
Come on, pick up the mic, Freddy.

1098
01:49:21,105 --> 01:49:23,440
Nobody here by that name. Sorry.

1099
01:49:23,524 --> 01:49:25,609
Hackerjerk-off.

1100
01:49:29,655 --> 01:49:31,699
Warlock...

1101
01:49:31,782 --> 01:49:37,037
I need you to do whatever it is you do
to patch me through to the FBI.

1102
01:49:37,121 --> 01:49:39,123
To Deputy Director Bowman.

1103
01:49:39,206 --> 01:49:41,793
- You hear me?
- Are you serious?

1104
01:49:41,876 --> 01:49:44,421
You want me to intentionally
open up a com line

1105
01:49:44,504 --> 01:49:48,300
to the head of the FBI's cyber division?
I don't think so.

1106
01:49:48,633 --> 01:49:51,052
Freddy, goddammit,
they have my daughter.

1107
01:49:56,391 --> 01:49:58,768
I can do that. Hold on.

1108
01:49:59,978 --> 01:50:02,063
Thank you.

1109
01:50:08,236 --> 01:50:11,615
This is Central.
We have a patch for Director Bowman.

1110
01:50:12,073 --> 01:50:15,076
Sir. Central's trying to reach you.

1111
01:50:16,411 --> 01:50:17,412
Go.

1112
01:50:17,495 --> 01:50:19,956
- Bowman, it's McClane.
- McClane.

1113
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:23,919
Listen to me. Gabriel is on the 695
headed north in a Hazmat truck.

1114
01:50:24,002 --> 01:50:27,964
Wait, Gabriel's left Woodlawn?
We're headed there right now.

1115
01:50:28,048 --> 01:50:31,259
Bowman. He's got my daughter.

1116
01:50:31,885 --> 01:50:36,556
Listen, this Hazmat truck is a government
vehicle, so it should be LoJacked, right?

1117
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:38,850
Track that down, it should take you to him.

1118
01:50:38,934 --> 01:50:42,479
- Give me the tag number.
- All right. Hang on. Here it comes.

1119
01:50:42,562 --> 01:50:44,689
Golf... Tango...

1120
01:50:46,232 --> 01:50:50,362
five... niner... two... November.

1121
01:50:50,445 --> 01:50:53,073
Got it. McClane, where is Farrell?

1122
01:50:53,156 --> 01:50:54,699
He's with them.

1123
01:50:55,576 --> 01:50:57,078
Listen to me.

1124
01:50:57,161 --> 01:51:01,624
I'm gonna go in there and get Lucy out,
but if something happens to me,

1125
01:51:01,707 --> 01:51:06,254
you gotta send the cavalry in, you hear me?
I mean everybody.

1126
01:51:06,337 --> 01:51:08,506
Don't let that maniac get my daughter.

1127
01:51:08,589 --> 01:51:12,009
- John, don't worry.
- I want your word, Bowman.

1128
01:51:14,345 --> 01:51:16,722
Yeah, you have it.

1129
01:51:16,806 --> 01:51:18,599
McClane out.

1130
01:51:25,898 --> 01:51:27,066
There's the F-35.

1131
01:51:29,694 --> 01:51:31,988
Did you get the "go" codes?

1132
01:51:32,071 --> 01:51:34,490
- Trey. Did you get the "go" codes?
- Yes.

1133
01:51:34,573 --> 01:51:37,243
Can you connect me to the pilot?

1134
01:51:53,843 --> 01:51:56,345
Isolating his radio.

1135
01:52:01,225 --> 01:52:03,936
Sending him the "go" codes.

1136
01:52:10,110 --> 01:52:11,361
AV-81.

1137
01:52:11,445 --> 01:52:16,783
- AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.
- Go for AV-81.

1138
01:52:16,867 --> 01:52:20,537
Confirmed terrorist vehicle
located in your sector. A big rig truck.

1139
01:52:21,997 --> 01:52:24,916
- Currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle.
- I see them.

1140
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,753
You are authorised to engage and destroy.

1141
01:52:27,836 --> 01:52:30,297
Copy that. AV-81 engaging.

1142
01:52:38,513 --> 01:52:39,723
What?

1143
01:52:47,606 --> 01:52:50,776
Jesus Christ! Goddammit!

1144
01:52:53,904 --> 01:52:55,781
You're shooting at the wrong guy.

1145
01:53:03,789 --> 01:53:06,124
I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.

1146
01:53:19,888 --> 01:53:21,723
Jackass!

1147
01:54:08,688 --> 01:54:11,024
Is that it?

1148
01:54:13,985 --> 01:54:16,821
Is that your best shot?

1149
01:54:58,697 --> 01:55:00,240
Come on!

1150
01:55:08,791 --> 01:55:10,084
Damn.

1151
01:55:26,475 --> 01:55:28,269
Come on.

1152
01:57:01,738 --> 01:57:03,698
Let's go. Come on.

1153
01:57:03,782 --> 01:57:05,868
That way. It's that way. Go.

1154
01:57:14,877 --> 01:57:17,546
We are leaving in three minutes.

1155
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,135
You have one.

1156
01:57:23,219 --> 01:57:26,722
The rules haven't changed.
You'll kill me the minute I unlock it.

1157
01:57:30,559 --> 01:57:33,145
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Matthew?

1158
01:57:33,229 --> 01:57:34,480
Matthew.

1159
01:57:34,563 --> 01:57:37,400
I really need you to pay attention.

1160
01:57:37,483 --> 01:57:41,237
- The rules can always change.
- OK, wait.

1161
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:43,698
- I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.
- Wait.

1162
01:57:43,781 --> 01:57:45,658
Nine.

1163
01:57:45,741 --> 01:57:47,326
I can't.

1164
01:57:47,410 --> 01:57:49,412
Eight.

1165
01:57:49,495 --> 01:57:51,289
I can't.

1166
01:57:52,081 --> 01:57:53,499
Oh, God.

1167
01:57:56,419 --> 01:57:57,712
OK.

1168
01:57:59,547 --> 01:58:01,007
OK, OK, OK.

1169
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:02,675
Six.

1170
01:58:02,758 --> 01:58:06,679
OK, stop. Stop, stop.
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

1171
01:58:06,762 --> 01:58:09,390
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

1172
01:58:22,904 --> 01:58:25,282
Feds are headed this way.

1173
01:58:25,365 --> 01:58:27,993
- Get everything on the plane.
- Yep.

1174
01:58:37,127 --> 01:58:39,087
- Dad.
- Careful.

1175
01:58:39,171 --> 01:58:42,674
Don't worry, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.

1176
01:58:44,676 --> 01:58:46,762
Daddy!

1177
01:58:51,934 --> 01:58:53,518
No.

1178
01:58:53,602 --> 01:58:55,938
Hold this.

1179
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:19,795
No.

1180
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:23,257
Jesus Christ.

1181
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:25,550
You got her?

1182
01:59:25,926 --> 01:59:27,844
You're sure?

1183
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:31,556
Nice effort, though.

1184
01:59:32,182 --> 01:59:35,270
- Matthew.
- Oh, shit. All right, OK.

1185
01:59:35,353 --> 01:59:37,188
OK. I'm doin' it. I know.

1186
01:59:45,071 --> 01:59:47,073
McClane.

1187
01:59:47,156 --> 01:59:50,076
Would you do me a favour?

1188
01:59:51,411 --> 01:59:56,374
I know the lights are beginning to dim,
but if you could just hang on for a second,

1189
01:59:56,457 --> 01:59:59,669
when Matt's finished,
I'm gonna kill him and your daughter,

1190
01:59:59,752 --> 02:00:02,630
and I would love for you to see that.

1191
02:00:04,215 --> 02:00:06,676
Goddammit. Matthew?

1192
02:00:06,759 --> 02:00:09,262
Ten seconds, OK?
You'll have all your money.

1193
02:00:09,345 --> 02:00:13,433
- You just leave. No one has to get hurt, OK?
- A few seconds. Stay with me.

1194
02:00:13,516 --> 02:00:15,643
McClane.

1195
02:00:16,686 --> 02:00:19,147
- Stay with me.
- Dad?

1196
02:00:19,897 --> 02:00:25,153
On your tombstone it should read, " Always
in the wrong place at the wrong time."

1197
02:00:25,945 --> 02:00:29,907
How 'bout,
"Yippee-ki-yay, motherf..."

1198
02:00:43,630 --> 02:00:46,342
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy...

1199
02:00:46,425 --> 02:00:49,595
- Are you OK?
- Yes, baby, I'm fine.

1200
02:00:51,639 --> 02:00:53,182
I knew you'd come for me.

1201
02:00:53,265 --> 02:00:57,978
Of course I'd come for you, honey.
Sorry it took me so long. It's OK.

1202
02:01:05,861 --> 02:01:07,529
Move, move.

1203
02:01:12,576 --> 02:01:14,203
Freeze!

1204
02:01:14,286 --> 02:01:17,164
Hold, hold. He's OK.

1205
02:01:19,166 --> 02:01:21,835
- Get that vehicle.
- Come around.

1206
02:01:21,919 --> 02:01:24,088
- Here, help Daddy up.
- OK.

1207
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:28,842
Wait, wait.
I think I'll just stay here for a minute.

1208
02:01:28,926 --> 02:01:33,055
- OK. Daddy, you're outta your mind.
- What are you talkin' about?

1209
02:01:33,138 --> 02:01:37,977
- You shot yourself.
- It seemed like a good idea at the time.

1210
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:41,188
Don't tell these guys that I did that.

1211
02:01:52,533 --> 02:01:55,327
- Thanks for all your help, John.
- Thank you.

1212
02:01:57,288 --> 02:01:59,248
Is he OK?

1213
02:02:00,292 --> 02:02:03,128
- Should I put my hands up?
- No, don't put your hands up.

1214
02:02:03,211 --> 02:02:05,547
Put 'em down further?

1215
02:02:05,630 --> 02:02:09,968
Might die of shock on the way to the hospital.

1216
02:02:12,679 --> 02:02:14,556
All right.

1217
02:02:16,558 --> 02:02:18,476
I'll be right back.

1218
02:02:20,186 --> 02:02:22,355
- Hey.
- Hey.

1219
02:02:22,439 --> 02:02:25,066
- How's it feel to be shot?
- It actually feels great.

1220
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:28,570
He gave me some...
What's it called? Morphine.

1221
02:02:28,653 --> 02:02:34,326
- Well, you got your merit badge now.
- Yeah. I don't know what that means.

1222
02:02:34,409 --> 02:02:38,413
- Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.
- Really?

1223
02:02:39,914 --> 02:02:41,916
Not that one.

1224
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,793
- What?
- Don't even think about it.

1225
02:02:43,877 --> 02:02:47,631
How did you know what I was thinking?
Did she say something to you?

1226
02:02:47,714 --> 02:02:52,260
- I felt like we had kind of a vibe.
- Easy. That's just the morphine kickin' in.

1227
02:02:52,344 --> 02:02:53,762
Yeah.

1228
02:02:53,845 --> 02:02:58,934
Besides, after all we've been through,
I'd hate to have to beat you to death.

1229
02:03:00,685 --> 02:03:02,687
That would suck.

1230
02:03:04,272 --> 02:03:06,107
- Good to go?
- Yeah, all set.

1231
02:03:06,191 --> 02:03:09,903
Take care of yourself.
I'll see you at the hospital.

1232
02:03:16,535 --> 02:03:20,957
Thanks for saving my daughter's life.

1233
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:23,417
What was I gonna do?

1234
02:03:24,877 --> 02:03:27,046
That's what makes you that guy.

1235
02:03:30,049 --> 02:03:32,343
Yeah.

1236
02:03:37,807 --> 02:03:40,685
So, did he say anything about me?

1237
02:03:42,603 --> 02:03:44,647
Jesus, Lucy.

1238
02:03:44,730 --> 02:03:46,941
What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.

1239
02:03:48,442 --> 02:03:50,861
I'm in enough pain already.

1240
02:03:50,945 --> 02:03:52,863
Hospital.
