2
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,023
Remember... I love you.

3
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,784
I love you, Thomas.

4
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,508
Mom!

5
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,623
Mom!

6
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,185
Thomas...

7
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,028
it's okay.

8
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,340
No, no, no!

9
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,711
<i>Thomas!</i>

10
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,221
<i>Thomas!</i>

11
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,231
Thomas!

12
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,986
Wake up! We gotta go! Come on!

13
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,027
Let's go! Let's go! We gotta go!

14
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,182
You all right? You all right?

15
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,341
Wait, wait, wait!

16
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,144
Where are you going?

17
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,029
We don't have time!

18
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,227
Come on!

19
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,701
Get out of here!

20
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,869
Cranks! We got Cranks!

21
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,863
Gotta move! Not safe out here, kid!

22
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,260
Got a swarm to the flank!

23
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,706
Go, kid! Go, go!

24
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,582
Set a perimeter!
Hold them back on the right side!

25
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,389
Come on, kids, let's go!
Let's go! Move it! Come on!

26
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,230
Keep moving! Keep moving!

27
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,541
Tell him to take off! We're clear!

28
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,865
You kids doing all right?

29
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,900
Sorry about all the fuss.
We had ourselves a bit of a swarm.

30
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,789
Who are you?

31
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,861
I'm the reason you're all still alive.

32
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,102
It's my intention to keep you that way.

33
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,941
Now, come with me.
We'll get you kids squared away.

34
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,991
You can call me Mr. Janson.
I run this place.

35
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:45,102
For us it is a sanctuary,
safe from the horrors of the outside world.

36
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,742
You all should think of it
as a way station.

37
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,665
Kind of a home between homes.
Watch yourselves.

38
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,627
That mean you're taking us home?

39
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,303
A home of sorts.

40
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,744
Sadly, there wouldn't be much left
of wherever you came from.

41
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,425
But we do have a place for you.

42
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,110
A refuge, outside the Scorch,
where WICKED will never find you again.

43
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,268
How does that sound?

44
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,784
Why are you helping us?

45
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,784
Let's just say the world out there
is in a rather precarious situation.

46
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,181
We're all hanging on
by a very thin thread.

47
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,468
The fact that you kids
can survive the Flare virus...

48
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,591
makes you the best chance
of humanity's continued survival.

49
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,271
Unfortunately, it also makes you a target,
as no doubt by now you've noticed.

50
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,186
Beyond this door lies the beginning
of your new lives.

51
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,029
First things first...

52
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,389
let's do something about that smell.

53
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,701
All right!

54
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,146
Oh, man!

55
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,466
Feels great!

56
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,189
Frypan, how you feel over there?

57
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,303
Wait, what is that?

58
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,101
Just a little cocktail.
Calcium, folate, vitamins A through Z.

59
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,991
Pretty much everything
you've been deprived of out there.

60
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,630
Try to relax.

61
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,544
Sure you got enough there?

62
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,981
Evening, Dr. Crawford.

63
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,467
Good evening.
How are the new arrivals holding up?

64
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,065
So far, so good.

65
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,870
All right.

66
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,503
And you must be Teresa.

67
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,581
Thomas?

68
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,020
Yeah?

69
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,831
Come with me, please.

70
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,628
Thomas, thank you for seeing me.

71
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,667
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

72
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,269
I was just hoping we might get a moment
to chat in private, away from the others.

73
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,221
Well...

74
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,182
I won't take up
too much of your time.

75
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,870
I really only have one question.

76
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,870
What do you remember about WICKED?

77
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,871
You're not in trouble.

78
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,031
We're just having a conversation.
I'm just trying to understand.

79
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,869
Understand what?

80
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,261
Whose side are you on?

81
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,224
I remember I used to work for WICKED.

82
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,146
I remember that they sent me
into the maze.

83
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,344
I remember watching my friends die
in front of me.

84
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,182
I'm on their side.

85
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,951
Interesting.

86
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,309
You say you worked for WICKED,
but they sent you into the maze.

87
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,980
Why would they do something like that?

88
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,183
I don't know. Maybe you should've
asked them before you killed them all.

89
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,386
I'll be sure to keep that in mind.

90
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,270
Enjoy the rest of your stay.

91
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,306
That's it?

92
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,349
Yeah, you've told me
everything I need to know.

93
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,629
You and your friends have all
been cleared to join the others.

94
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,949
Soon you'll all be moving
on to greener pastures.

95
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
Wait.

96
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,226
Others?

97
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,266
Hey, Thomas!

98
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,744
Hey, Minho, what's going on?

99
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,789
We weren't the only maze.
Come on.

100
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,423
And there was this big, loud explosion,
and these guys came out of nowhere.

101
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,343
Started shooting up the place.

102
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,740
It was intense.

103
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,182
They pulled us out of the maze
and brought us here.

104
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,830
What about the rest?

105
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,706
The other people left behind in the maze,
what happened to them?

106
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,866
I don't know.

107
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,148
I guess WICKED still has them.

108
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,229
- How long you guys been here?
- Not long.

109
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,945
Just a day or two.

110
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,546
That kid over there has been here
the longest.

111
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,309
Almost a week.

112
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,504
His maze was nothing but girls.

113
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,741
Really?

114
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,908
Some guys have all the luck.

115
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,185
Good evening, gentlemen. Ladies.

116
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,543
You all know how this works.
If you hear your name called...

117
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,228
please rise in an orderly fashion,
join my colleagues behind me...

118
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,030
where they will escort you
to the eastern wing.

119
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,387
Your new lives are about to begin.

120
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,420
Connor.

121
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,541
Evelyn.

122
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Ev!

123
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,860
Justin.

124
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,911
Peter.

125
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,945
Allison.

126
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,546
Squiggly.

127
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,311
All right. Settle down.

128
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,587
Franklin. And Abigail.

129
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,390
Now, now, don't get discouraged.
If I could take more, I would.

130
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,262
There's always tomorrow.
Your time will come.

131
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,230
Go on, eat up.

132
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,311
Where are they going?

133
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,231
Far from here.

134
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,424
Lucky bastards.

135
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,505
Some kind of farm. A safe place.

136
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,106
They can only take in
a couple of people at a time.

137
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,825
What the hell?

138
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,786
Hey, Teresa?

139
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,140
Teresa!

140
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,427
Hey, hey, hey.

141
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,070
Where are they taking her?

142
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,389
They just have to run a few more tests.

143
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,747
Don't worry,
they'll be done with her soon.

144
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,629
Is she okay?

145
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,500
She's fine.

146
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,264
I got top bunk.

147
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,024
Too slow.

148
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,584
I could get used to this.

149
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,790
Yeah. It's not bad.

150
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,627
Hey, what do you think
those guys want with Teresa?

151
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,061
Now, if there's one thing I know about that girl,
she can take care of herself.

152
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,149
Don't worry about it.

153
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,147
Hey.

154
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,426
Down here.

155
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,630
Oh, my God.

156
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,906
Come on. Follow me.

157
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,301
What?

158
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,145
Hurry, this way.

159
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,306
Come on.

160
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,020
Hey, wait a second.
What the hell are we doing?

161
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,990
Come on, we're gonna miss it.

162
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,028
What the hell am I doing?

163
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,591
What are we doing?

164
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,786
Come here.

165
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,181
Watch.

166
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,742
What the hell was that?

167
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,387
They bring in new ones every night
like clockwork.

168
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,185
You know what they do with them?

169
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,222
I don't know.
This is as far as I've ever gotten.

170
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,060
The vents don't even go
into that section.

171
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,871
But once they go through that door,
they don't come back out.

172
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,946
I don't think anybody
ever really leaves this place.

173
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,743
Come on. We've gotta go
before somebody notices we're gone.

174
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,989
Why did you show me this?

175
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,421
Because maybe the others
will listen to you.

176
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,347
There's something weird going on here.
And I know you think so too.

177
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,829
Hey, wait.

178
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,785
What's your name?

179
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,791
Aris.

180
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,301
<i>Alice.</i>

181
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,146
Barry.

182
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,471
Walt.

183
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,145
Edgar.

184
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,302
Samantha.

185
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,542
I wanna know what's through that door.

186
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,422
Aaron.

187
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,911
Now, we've been over this.

188
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,347
You said they were covered up,
so you don't know what you saw.

189
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,740
- Dennis.
- It could've been anything under there.

190
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,620
I know exactly what I saw.
They were bodies.

191
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,389
Sally.

192
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,708
Aris said they bring in
a new batch every night.

193
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,271
Who the hell is Aris?

194
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,467
Henry.

195
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,460
Tim.

196
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,266
Well, I'm sold.

197
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,101
And last but not least, David.

198
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,987
Thank you for your attention.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

199
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,987
Okay, until we know anything for certain,
we should just keep our heads down...

200
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,791
and try not to draw any attention
to ourselves, all right?

201
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,386
What is he doing?

202
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,220
I think he's drawing attention to himself.

203
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,622
Hang on. You weren't called.

204
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,747
I know, I'm just gonna be a second.

205
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,664
This is a restricted area, kid.

206
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,421
I just wanna see my friend.
Can you let me through?

207
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,706
Get your ass back in that chair.

208
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,222
<i>Just remember, you are always being monitored.
Breaking the rules...</i>

209
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Back off!

210
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,420
What's your problem, man?
What the hell, huh?

211
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,342
Back off!

212
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,831
Why won't you let me see her?

213
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,020
Control your friend!

214
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,261
What's happening here?

215
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,191
Thomas?

216
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,229
I thought we could trust each other.

217
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,586
You know we're all
on the same team here.

218
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,746
Are we?

219
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,580
Get them to their bunks.

220
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,341
Get your asses in there! All of you!

221
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,271
What the hell was that about?

222
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,184
You didn't really think
they were just gonna let you through?

223
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,910
Nah, of course I didn't.

224
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,587
I'm gonna find out
what's on the other side of that door.

225
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,821
Right.

226
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,820
Newt, they're hiding something. Okay?

227
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,620
These people are not
who they say they are.

228
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,940
No, Thomas, you don't know that!

229
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,548
The only thing that we do know
is that they helped rescue us from WICKED.

230
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,783
They gave us new clothes. They gave us food.
They gave us a proper bed.

231
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,705
Some of us haven't had that
in a long time.

232
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,509
Yeah, but...

233
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,702
Some of us a lot longer than others.

234
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
Hey, Thomas.

235
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,021
What the...

236
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,421
You got it, didn't you?

237
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,548
Yeah. Let's go.

238
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,310
All right, look, maybe you guys are right.
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

239
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,749
But I got to find out for sure.
Just cover for me.

240
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,425
I'll be back as soon as I can.

241
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,070
What the hell?

242
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Teresa?

243
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,700
It's Rachel.

244
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,590
They took her the first night.

245
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,022
I told her it was going to be okay.

246
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,145
You sure this can't wait?

247
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,590
She was very specific, sir.

248
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,340
She wanted to speak with you personally.

249
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,781
As if I don't have enough to deal with.

250
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,429
Just bear with me. I'm getting
some interference from the storm.

251
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,948
Come on. It's good enough.
Make the connection.

252
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,745
Good evening, Doctor Paige.

253
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,425
Lovely to see you again.

254
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,820
Although I admit...

255
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,864
I wasn't expecting to hear from you
quite so soon.

256
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,624
<i>Change of plans, Janson.</i>

257
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,461
<i>I'll be arriving a little sooner than expected.
First thing tomorrow.</i>

258
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,903
We'll be delighted to have you.

259
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,751
I think you'll be pleased
with the progress we've made.

260
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,183
As you can see, early results
have been extremely promising.

261
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,830
Whatever it is you've been doing
to them in there, it's working.

262
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,309
<i>Not well enough.</i>

263
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,789
<i>I just received board approval.</i>

264
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,548
<i>I want all the remaining subjects sedated
and prepped for harvest by the time I arrive.</i>

265
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,070
Doctor Paige, we are going
as fast as we can.

266
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,380
We are still running tests...

267
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,189
<i>Try something faster.</i>

268
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,870
<i>Until I can guarantee their security,
this is the best plan.</i>

269
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,781
Ma'am, security is my job.
We're on 24 hour lockdown here.

270
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,351
I am assuring you...

271
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,901
the assets are secure.

272
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,188
<i>Have you found the Right Arm?</i>

273
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,227
Not yet.

274
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,940
We tracked them as far as the mountains.

275
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,260
<i>So they're still out there.</i>

276
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,861
<i>And they've already hit
two of our installations.</i>

277
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,463
<i>They want these kids as badly as we do.
And I cannot...</i>

278
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,431
<i>I cannot afford another loss.</i>

279
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,231
<i>Not now, when I am so close to a cure.</i>

280
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,302
<i>If you are not up to the task,
I will find someone who is.</i>

281
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,064
That won't be necessary.

282
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,907
Might I suggest we start
with the most recent arrivals.

283
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,381
<i>Just get it done.</i>

284
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,301
<i>Janson.</i>

285
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,746
<i>I don't want them to feel any pain.</i>

286
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,904
They won't feel a thing.

287
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,740
Thomas!

288
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,787
We gotta go.
We gotta go right now.

289
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,783
- What the hell are you talking about?
- What do you mean, "We gotta go?"

290
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,465
They're coming. Come on. We gotta go.

291
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,866
They're coming for us.

292
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,864
- Paige. She's still alive.
- What happened in there?

293
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Aris, what happened?

294
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,670
Thomas, can you just calm down
and talk to us.

295
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,629
- She's still alive.
- Who's she? Teresa?

296
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,622
Ava.

297
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,542
Ava?

298
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,986
Will you just turn around and talk to us?

299
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,471
It's WICKED!

300
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,101
It's still WICKED.

301
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,301
It's always been WICKED.

302
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,706
Thomas.

303
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,903
What did you see?

304
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,421
Come on, come on.

305
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,947
Okay, let's go.

306
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,511
You guys go ahead.
There's something I gotta do.

307
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,740
What are you talking about?

308
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,188
Trust me, it's important. You guys wanna
get outta here, right? Just go.

309
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,182
I'll go with him.

310
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,865
Okay, Winston, go! Go! Come on.

311
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,260
You sure we can trust this kid?

312
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,260
You don't want to know
where we'd be without him.

313
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,747
What are you kids doing out?

314
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,862
I want this place locked down.
Call everyone in.

315
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,909
No one leaves until
everyone's accounted for.

316
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,427
Tell me you've got eyes on them.

317
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,911
Still looking, still looking.

318
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,989
Come on, come on, come on.

319
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,780
There.

320
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Who is that?

321
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,907
Crawford. Going after the girl.

322
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,220
Get everyone to the med wing.

323
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
Yes, sir.

324
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,341
I want them alive.

325
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:47,943
Freeze!

326
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,100
Stay where you are!

327
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,780
- Why are they shooting at us?
- I've spotted them!

328
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,066
- They're in L-3!
- Minho!

329
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,824
- I'm in pursuit!
- What the hell are you doing?

330
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,141
Minho!

331
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,225
Shit, Minho!

332
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,182
Okay. Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

333
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,860
Dr. Crawford, are you here to...

334
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,988
Wait, wait. Okay, okay.

335
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,861
Where is she? Where is she!

336
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,341
Get over!

337
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,020
Get down!

338
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,147
- Teresa.
- Get down!

339
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,064
- Okay, hands, give me your hands!
- Just do what he says.

340
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,301
What did they do to you?

341
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,222
Thomas?

342
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,420
Give me your hands!

343
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,060
You're never gonna get away with this.

344
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,260
What's going on?

345
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,711
We gotta leave right now.
Come on.

346
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,862
Guys? They're coming! Where do we go?

347
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,386
Frypan! Move!

348
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,550
Get back! Get back!

349
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,220
They've got the door barricaded.
Send backup!

350
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,666
Okay, we gotta get outta here!

351
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,861
Where do we go?

352
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,862
Push!

353
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,260
Everyone stand back!

354
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
Come on!

355
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,341
Newt! Help, help!

356
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,780
Ready?

357
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,585
Go, go, go!

358
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,740
Get out of the way!

359
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,469
Come on, come on!

360
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,027
- Come on, come on!
- Get someone on the other side!

361
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,466
Watch your feet!

362
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,588
- Hurry! Let's go!
- Come on, move! Move! Move!

363
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,540
Thomas!

364
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
Let's go!

365
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,904
Stay behind me!

366
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,228
Shit. Okay, come on!

367
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,505
Stop!

368
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,345
There it is! There it is!

369
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,986
<i>Converge on level 3.</i>

370
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,630
<i>All R-16 personnel...</i>

371
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,982
<i>non-lethal force only.</i>

372
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,947
Shit. Come on!

373
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,750
No, no, no!

374
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,186
Thomas!

375
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,831
Open this door, Janson!

376
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,141
You really don't want me to.

377
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,546
Open the damn door!

378
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,465
Listen to me!
I'm trying to save your life.

379
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,980
The maze is one thing, but you kids
wouldn't last one day...

380
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,068
out in the Scorch.

381
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,661
If the elements don't kill you,
the Cranks will.

382
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,309
Thomas, you have to believe me.

383
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,904
I only want what's best for you.

384
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,227
Yeah, let me guess. WICKED is good?

385
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,987
You're not getting through
that door, Thomas.

386
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,982
Hey, guys.

387
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,551
Come on!

388
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,709
Thomas! Come on! Let's go!

389
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,141
Go, go. Stop him!

390
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,944
Shut the main vault door!

391
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,466
- No!
- Thomas?

392
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,384
Come on, Thomas! Come on!

393
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,308
- Move! Move!
- Thomas, what's going on?

394
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,108
Come on.

395
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,705
You little shit.

396
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,302
Come on, Thomas. Let's go. Come on!

397
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,821
Come on. Keep moving!

398
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,830
Come on. Come on!

399
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,066
Come on, come on!

400
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,506
Fan out!

401
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,463
All right, come on. Keep going!

402
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
Shit.

403
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,061
Come on, go! Go!
We'll lose them in the storm!

404
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,980
<i>Notify on visual.</i>

405
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,902
<i>Copy that.</i>

406
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,824
<i>Standby, Two.
Be on my six.</i>

407
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,226
Everybody, go, go, go.
Stay low. Stay low!

408
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,549
Teresa, hang on. Stay together!

409
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,031
I think we lost them!

410
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,670
Keep going, guys. Let's go.

411
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,501
Watch out!
Where are we even going?

412
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,460
Come on, Aris. Let's go. Come on!

413
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,911
Over here!

414
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,182
Come on!

415
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,740
Teresa, wait!
No, don't go in there!

416
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,861
Get down here!

417
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,705
- Okay, come on!
- Get inside!

418
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,861
Come on, we should go.

419
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,181
Aris, get in!

420
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,666
Let's go, Fry.

421
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,990
Can you hold onto this?

422
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,180
Where the hell are we?

423
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,541
We gotta go.

424
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,380
- No. Thomas, stop!
- We gotta keep moving.

425
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,424
Tell me what's going on.

426
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,385
It's WICKED.

427
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,267
It's WICKED. They lied to us.
We never escaped.

428
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,389
Me and Aris, we found bodies.

429
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,423
Too many to count.

430
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,742
What do you mean? Dead bodies?

431
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,908
No, but they weren't alive either.

432
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,267
They had them strung up.

433
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,024
With tubes coming out of them.

434
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,262
They were being drained.

435
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,426
There's something inside
of us that WICKED wants.

436
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,263
Something in our blood.

437
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,063
So we have to get as far away
from them as possible.

438
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,262
Okay. So, what's the plan?

439
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,226
You do have a plan, right?

440
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,223
Yeah. I don't know.

441
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,946
Well, we followed you
out here, Thomas...

442
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,943
and now you're saying that you have no idea
where we're going...

443
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,421
or what we're doing.

444
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:20,144
Wait. Janson said something
about people hiding in the mountains.

445
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,667
Some kind of resistance or army.

446
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,151
The Right Arm.

447
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,941
The Right Arm. If they're really
against WICKED, maybe they can help us.

448
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,431
People. In the mountains.
Mountain people.

449
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,787
That's your plan?

450
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,025
It's the only chance we have.

451
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,261
Hey, guys.

452
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,110
Check this out.

453
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,705
Minho, give me a light!

454
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,829
Someone's been down here.

455
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,190
Come on. Open up.

456
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,066
Looks like people lived here.

457
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,944
Where are they now?

458
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,941
Let's pack some of this stuff up.

459
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,428
Anything you think you might need.

460
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,947
We'll split up, see what else we can find.
Meet back here.

461
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,271
Wait, Thomas.

462
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
Let's go.

463
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,582
Thomas.

464
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,741
Yeah?

465
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,061
All those kids that we
left behind back there.

466
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,264
I don't want to end up like that.

467
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,461
Hey.

468
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,782
Do you hear me?

469
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,062
Yeah, I hear you.

470
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,946
Good. Now, what are we
looking for out here?

471
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,102
Signs of life.

472
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,663
People. Survivors.
Anyone who can help us.

473
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,505
Does he count?

474
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,465
Shit.

475
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,031
They had power.

476
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,661
You all right?

477
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,866
I'm fine.

478
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,381
What?

479
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,109
Where did you go?

480
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,504
This looks promising.

481
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,501
Hey, Minho. Wait!

482
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,940
Thomas, watch out!

483
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,186
Get back, get back!

484
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,741
Jesus.

485
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,265
Her eyes!

486
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,431
Oh, shit.

487
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,340
Stay back!

488
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,669
What the hell is that thing?

489
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,426
Gotta move! Go!

490
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,427
Go!

491
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,985
- Hold it down!
- What?

492
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,950
- Hold it down!
- Minho, what are you doing?

493
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,711
Watch out! Watch out!

494
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,629
Go, go, go!

495
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,710
Let's get the hell out of here!

496
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,661
Shit.

497
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,667
What's going on?

498
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,026
I don't know.

499
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,300
Hey!

500
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,707
Hey!

501
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,860
Run!

502
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,670
Go!

503
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,106
Shit!

504
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,341
Hey!

505
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,102
Go!

506
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,421
Get outta here!

507
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,026
Run!

508
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,181
Come on!

509
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,863
Let's go, go, go!

510
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,741
Let's go!

511
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,500
Thomas, Minho,
what the hell are those things?

512
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,145
I don't know. Just keep going!

513
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,306
Move! Move!

514
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,826
Where do we go?

515
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,903
Come on, keep moving!

516
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,509
- Aris, no!
- No!

517
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,741
Go! Go around!

518
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,060
Teresa!

519
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,941
Minho, come on!

520
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,268
Come on, come on!

521
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,985
Where the hell are we gonna go?

522
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,784
We gotta find a way out of here!

523
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,426
Go!

524
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,861
Faster, faster!

525
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,306
Newt! Newt!

526
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,746
Guys, help!

527
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,868
Newt, you good?

528
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,347
Yeah. Thanks, Tommy.

529
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,104
- Come on, Newt!
- Keep going!

530
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,547
Through here, through here!
Let's go! They're coming!

531
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,581
Guys, where are we going?

532
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,261
Okay, run! Go! Go!

533
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,582
- Just keep going!
- Come on, they're coming!

534
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,860
It's a dead end!

535
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,069
Get us out of here, Thomas!

536
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,540
This one!

537
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,303
I'll hold them back!

538
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,461
Harder!

539
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,631
Get that door open!

540
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,781
Move!

541
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,630
Come on, Frypan! Let's go!

542
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,141
Come on! It's open!

543
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,586
Everyone through!
Come on! Come on!

544
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,626
Winston!

545
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,985
Help me!

546
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,630
Help! Please!

547
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,587
Please! Oh, my God!

548
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,141
Go, go, go!

549
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,348
- Get up, Winston!
- Hurry!

550
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,821
Minho, go! I'm right behind you!

551
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,061
Let's go! Let's go!

552
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,181
Thomas. Get in.

553
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,510
Hey! Get out of here!

554
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,589
Are they gone?

555
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,342
Yeah, I think we're safe for now.

556
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,064
Okay, we should get moving.

557
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,904
Let's pack it up.

558
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,107
Aris, come on.

559
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,228
Fry, Winston. Let's go.

560
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,380
Hey, man.

561
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,063
You okay?

562
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,308
What the hell happened to this place?

563
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,106
I don't know.

564
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,471
It doesn't look like anyone's been here
in a long time.

565
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,871
I hope the whole world's not like this.

566
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,984
Hang on, stop.

567
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,180
Do you hear that?

568
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,342
Get down!

569
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,911
Everybody, hide! Hide! Hide!

570
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,062
Get in here. In here, in here!

571
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,580
Oh, shit.

572
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,708
They're never gonna stop looking for us,
are they?

573
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,542
Everyone good?

574
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,871
Yeah.

575
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,231
A little further, guys.

576
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,389
Those mountains, that's gotta be it.

577
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,070
That's where we're going.

578
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,903
That's a long way off.

579
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,270
Then we better get moving.

580
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,303
Winston! Hey, Winston!

581
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,626
Winston!

582
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,781
He's hurt pretty bad.

583
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,948
What do we do?

584
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,780
Shit.

585
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,309
Winston. Can you hear me?

586
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,101
It's okay.

587
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,230
Hang in there, Winston.

588
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,540
Thomas.

589
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,940
Grab his legs.

590
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,465
I got him, I got him.

591
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,225
Gotta find shelter!

592
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,986
Thanks.

593
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,149
It's like they're getting further away.

594
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,821
We just gotta keep moving.
We can make it.

595
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,660
How's it looking?

596
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,625
It's a little further.

597
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,989
That's not very convincing.

598
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,701
Hey, what's going on with you?

599
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,389
They did something to me.

600
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:38,026
At first it just felt like I was waking up
from a dream or something.

601
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,781
Then they all started coming back.

602
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,065
Your memories?

603
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,021
What do you remember?

604
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,906
I remember the first time
they brought you in.

605
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,224
I was taller than you then. And faster.

606
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,666
Okay.

607
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,348
And I remember why we were there.

608
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,748
We thought we could fix all this.

609
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,701
I think we should go back.

610
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,227
- What?
- Just listen to me.

611
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,986
What are you talking about? Go back?
After everything they've done to us.

612
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,187
No, it's not that simple.

613
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,620
Yeah, I think it is that simple.

614
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,941
No. You don't understand.

615
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,590
What don't I understand?

616
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,748
Everything was fine until you...

617
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,225
What?

618
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,306
Nothing.

619
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,105
Teresa, what aren't you telling me?

620
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,508
Hey!

621
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,661
Guys, get down here!

622
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,390
Winston what are you doing, man?

623
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,269
- Give me that!
- What's going on?

624
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,660
- What happened?
- I don't know.

625
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,429
He just woke up and grabbed the gun
and then he tried to...

626
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,866
Give it back, please.

627
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,221
Winston, are you okay?

628
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,341
It's growing...

629
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,786
inside me.

630
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,424
I'm not gonna make it.

631
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,463
Please. Please.

632
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,511
Don't let me turn
into one of those things.

633
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,146
Wait, Newt...

634
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,590
Thank you.

635
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,622
Now, get outta here.

636
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,107
Good-bye, Winston.

637
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,986
Go.

638
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,667
It's okay.

639
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,425
I'm sorry.

640
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,990
Thomas.

641
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,744
Take care of them.

642
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,623
I thought we were supposed to be immune.

643
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,146
Not all of us, I guess.

644
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,100
If Winston can get infected...

645
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,667
we should assume so can the rest of us.

646
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,268
I never thought I'd say it...

647
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,186
I miss the Glade.

648
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,423
Hey. Hey.

649
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,980
Get up.

650
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,383
Newt, get up. Come on, let's go.
Frypan, Aris.

651
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,540
I see something.

652
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,821
What is it? What...

653
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,105
You see that?

654
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,986
It's lights.

655
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,227
We made it.

656
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,621
Let's go. We gotta go.
Come on.

657
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,590
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

658
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,309
Hurry!

659
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,460
Go!

660
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,101
Run!

661
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,631
Keep moving! Come on!

662
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,827
Let's go!

663
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,904
Come on, Teresa!

664
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,060
Go, go, go!

665
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,466
We're getting closer!

666
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,791
Keep going!

667
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,664
Get inside! Go!

668
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,226
Oh, shi-...

669
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,546
Minho!

670
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,350
Come help him!

671
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,227
Come on, get him up.

672
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,821
Keep going!

673
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:47,981
Go!

674
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,542
Move!

675
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,906
Come on! Hurry up!

676
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,983
Come on! Get in.

677
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:58,902
Put him down.

678
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,100
Watch his head.

679
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,710
Who's got a light?

680
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,301
Minho!

681
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,464
- Come on, come on.
- Minho?

682
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,781
Minho?

683
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,311
Come on, Minho.

684
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,027
Come on, man.

685
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,340
There he is.

686
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,541
There you go.

687
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,987
Here you are. Are you okay?

688
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,747
What happened?

689
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,344
I think you got struck by lightning.

690
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,266
Come on, let's get him up.

691
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,831
Nice and slow.

692
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,460
Okay.

693
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,541
Let's get him up.

694
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,747
Think you can get up?

695
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,900
Yeah?

696
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,349
Oh, my God.

697
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,108
Thanks, guys.

698
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,260
Hey.

699
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,701
What's that smell?

700
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,941
Behind you!

701
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,421
Oh, shit! Oh, my God.

702
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,470
I see you've met our guard dogs.

703
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,105
Who's that?

704
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,469
Stay back! Stay back!

705
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,469
You guys look like shit.

706
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,111
Come on. Follow me.

707
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,186
Unless you want to stay here with them.

708
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,146
Oh, my.

709
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,585
Come on, keep up.

710
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,788
Jorge wants to meet you.

711
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,146
Who's Jorge?

712
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,740
You'll see.

713
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:25,351
No one's come out of the Scorch
in a long time.

714
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,864
You've just got him curious.

715
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,271
And me, too.

716
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,861
Anyone else starting to get
a bad feeling about this place?

717
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,428
Let's just hear him out.
See what he has to say.

718
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,745
Jorge, they're here.

719
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,380
Quiet.

720
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,581
Damn it.

721
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,266
Do you ever get the feeling
the whole world's against you?

722
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:24,065
Three questions.
Where did you come from?

723
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,789
Where are you going?

724
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,904
How can I profit?

725
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,468
Don't all answer at once.

726
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:41,584
We're headed for the mountains.
Looking for the Right Arm.

727
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,423
You're looking for ghosts, you mean.

728
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,150
Question number two.

729
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,668
Where did you come from?

730
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,345
That's our business.

731
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,540
Hey!

732
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,951
Get the hell off me!

733
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,824
Get the hell off me, man!

734
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,825
Shut up, you big baby.

735
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:15,980
What is that?

736
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,391
You were right.

737
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,982
Right about what?
What is she talking about?

738
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,463
I'm sorry, <i>hermano.</i>

739
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:33,983
Looks like you're tagged.

740
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,143
You came from WICKED.

741
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,184
Which means...

742
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:46,820
You're very valuable.

743
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:02,020
Good plan, Thomas.
"Just hear what the man has to say."

744
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:03,910
Really working out for us.

745
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,550
Shut up, Minho.

746
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:08,182
Maybe I can reach the rope.

747
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,188
Enjoying the view?

748
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,582
What the hell do you want?

749
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:24,143
That is the question.

750
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:28,341
My men want to sell you back to WICKED.

751
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:33,189
Life has taught them to think small.
I'm not like that.

752
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,509
Something tells me
that you're not either.

753
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:39,267
Is the blood rushing to my head
or is this shank not making any sense?

754
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:45,220
Tell me what you know
about the Right Arm.

755
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,903
I thought you said they were ghosts.

756
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,222
I happen to believe in ghosts.

757
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:55,544
Especially when I hear them
chattering on the airwaves.

758
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,901
You tell me what you know,
and maybe we can make a deal.

759
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,065
We don't know much.

760
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:17,911
Okay! Okay, all right.

761
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,382
They're hiding in the mountains.

762
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,986
And they attacked WICKED.
They got out a bunch of kids.

763
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,585
That's it. That's all we know.

764
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,110
Yo, Jorge.

765
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,266
What's going on?

766
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,821
Me and my new friends
were just getting acquainted.

767
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,105
We're done now.

768
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:44,302
Hey, wait. You're not gonna help us?

769
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:49,469
Don't worry, <i>hermano.</i>

770
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,271
We'll get you back to where you belong.

771
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,341
Hang tight.

772
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,150
Going somewhere?

773
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,864
We both are.

774
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,944
Pack what you need. Do it quietly.

775
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,150
Where exactly are we going?

776
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:34,823
It's real, Bren.
These kids are our ticket.

777
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,347
The Right Arm can't turn us away.

778
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,190
Go now.

779
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,350
Okay. I got it.

780
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,945
Minho, ready?

781
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,181
Yeah.

782
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:02,501
Gotcha. Okay. One, two, here we go.

783
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:04,025
- Ready?
- Three.

784
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,709
Oh, shit.

785
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,627
In position. Send them in.

786
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:40,951
Come on, Minho. Push her harder!

787
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,101
Shit.

788
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:44,988
This is it.

789
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,141
One...

790
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,870
two... three!

791
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,504
- Yes!
- Yes!

792
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:52,661
Okay.

793
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,467
Teresa, hurry!

794
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,946
So what,
you're just gonna give it all up?

795
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,181
Everything you've built?

796
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,104
There's no future here.

797
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,941
What happens when another gang
finds this place?

798
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,751
And I lose control,
and I can't protect you.

799
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,107
I don't need you to protect me.

800
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,591
What happens if you get the Flare?

801
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:32,583
What am I supposed to do then?

802
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,629
Chain you up, watch you turn?

803
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:37,670
Put a bullet in your head?
Is that what you expect of me?

804
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,466
I would do the same thing for you.

805
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,391
<i>Good evening!</i>

806
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:50,271
<i>This is the
World Catastrophe Killzone Department.</i>

807
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,142
<i>We have your compound
completely surrounded.</i>

808
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:57,665
<i>You find yourselves,
through no fault of your own...</i>

809
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,862
<i>in possession of WICKED property.</i>

810
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,067
Barkley.

811
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,823
<i>Return them to us unharmed and we'll
consider this a simple misunderstanding.</i>

812
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:05,980
Hang on, guys.

813
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:07,820
<i>Or you can resist...</i>

814
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:08,788
Newt!

815
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:12,023
<i>...and every last one of you will die.</i>

816
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:16,301
<i>It won't be long before
the Flare wipes out the rest of us.</i>

817
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:19,782
<i>The hope of a cure lies in your hands.</i>

818
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,581
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

819
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:24,630
Go get the kids.

820
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,110
What are you gonna do?

821
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,786
I'm gonna play 'em my favorite song.

822
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,431
Oh, shit.

823
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,151
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

824
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,981
We're not trying to cause any trouble, okay?
We just got to get out of here.

825
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,585
Is that so?

826
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:49,391
Janson, I got 'em for ya.
I'm bringing 'em down.

827
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,025
<i>Don't shoot us.</i>

828
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:54,150
Come on. Let's go.

829
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,588
I said let's go.

830
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:07,870
You little bastard!

831
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,384
Okay. Come on.

832
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,068
Come on! Let's go!

833
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,663
<i>Barkley, what's your location?</i>

834
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,391
<i>Barkley, are you there?</i>

835
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,582
Sir, you hearing this?

836
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,270
What is that?

837
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,270
Brenda! Hurry!

838
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,264
We don't have much time!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

839
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,430
Right this way!

840
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:21,464
You gotta be kidding me.

841
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,826
Plan B, <i>hermano.</i>

842
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,943
You kids wanna get to the Right Arm?

843
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,262
I'll lead you to them.
But you're gonna owe me.

844
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,268
Follow me!

845
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,344
All right! Let's go!

846
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,584
- Come on!
- Everyone, go.

847
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,310
Go! Come on.

848
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:43,621
- Come on!
- Aris, come on.

849
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:51,270
All units, push in!

850
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,149
<i>They're on the top floor!
Top floor!</i>

851
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,631
We're on the move!

852
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:56,863
Go!

853
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:58,021
Go, Aris, go.

854
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,985
Teresa, you're next. Come on.

855
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,150
Brenda! Where you going?

856
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,469
Just go. I'm right behind you.

857
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:06,667
Hurry.

858
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,980
Alpha 22 in pursuit.
We're on the move!

859
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:14,825
Brenda, come on. What are you doing?

860
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,187
We gotta go!

861
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,501
- I got it.
- Come on.

862
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,180
Shit.

863
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,141
Take cover!

864
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,021
Go! Go!

865
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,141
Shit!

866
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,310
Come on, hurry!
We're running out of time!

867
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,825
- On the east!
- Cut 'em off!

868
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:44,821
I got eyes on!

869
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,386
Here, follow me!

870
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:48,540
Come on!

871
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,022
Stop! Stay right where you are!

872
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,145
Shit.

873
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,304
No, we need them.
You go around. I'll go after them.

874
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,620
Over here. Over here.

875
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:07,860
Kid, don't move!

876
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,550
Brenda, where are we going?

877
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,143
Hurry! The song's almost over!

878
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:28,266
Holy shit!

879
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,061
Come on.

880
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:40,824
Thomas! Come on!

881
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,781
Are you okay?

882
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:15,509
Yeah, great.

883
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,940
No, no. How are we gonna
get back to the others?

884
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,221
Relax. I'm gonna get us out of here.

885
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,381
Here.

886
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:38,824
Why are you helping us?

887
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,822
Trust me, it's not my idea.

888
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:45,030
Jorge seems to think you guys
are our ticket to the safe haven.

889
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,071
The what?

890
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,666
You know, paradise.

891
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,310
Safe from the sun,
free of infection.

892
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,424
Supposedly, the Right Arm's
been taking kids there for years.

893
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,831
Immunes, anyway.

894
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:04,104
And you know where that is?

895
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,301
No.

896
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:09,905
But Jorge knows a guy.
Marcus.

897
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,702
He used to smuggle kids
up into the mountains.

898
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,227
If Jorge made it out,
that's where he'll be taking your friends.

899
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,791
If he made it out?

900
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:25,381
You ask a lot of questions.

901
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:30,067
Can you just come over here
and help me with this?

902
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,545
Please.

903
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,063
Well, that doesn't sound good.

904
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:55,821
Yeah.

905
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,261
Down here they'll be full term.

906
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:03,624
Let's go.

907
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,024
I think it's this way.

908
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,671
You think?

909
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:41,062
Do people live down here?

910
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:44,030
The Solar Storms
forced people underground.

911
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:47,982
Jorge says there's settlements
all over these tunnels.

912
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,710
So, what about Jorge?
Is he your father?

913
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,271
Close enough.

914
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:57,307
Truth is, I don't really know what he is.
He's just always been there.

915
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:01,828
And I've always done what he's asked
me to do, no matter how stupid.

916
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,261
So you don't think
the Right Arm is real?

917
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,471
I think...

918
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,667
hope is a dangerous thing.

919
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:22,345
Hope has killed more of my friends
than the Flare and the Scorch combined.

920
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,871
Just thought Jorge was smarter than that.

921
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:37,501
Damn.

922
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,867
Hey, I think it might be this way.

923
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:01,861
Brenda?

924
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,226
Brenda?

925
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:09,350
I'm over here.
Look at this.

926
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,031
What? What is it?

927
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,422
What the hell is this?

928
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:38,908
I don't know.

929
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,226
Jesus.

930
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,101
Go, go, go!

931
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:51,065
Oh, my God!

932
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,101
Come on!

933
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,266
Keep going!

934
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,150
We're almost there. Come on.

935
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,145
Come on! This way!

936
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:32,186
Thomas! Come on!

937
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:41,741
Okay.

938
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,264
- Go, go!
- Come on!

939
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:52,660
Keep going!

940
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:57,701
Watch out!

941
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:12,387
Are you okay?

942
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:14,350
Come on!

943
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:17,826
Follow me!

944
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,871
Yeah, I'm behind you.

945
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:30,220
Go, go, go!

946
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:42,904
- Okay, go, go!
- Come on!

947
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:50,981
Brenda!

948
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:56,421
Brenda!

949
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,425
You okay?

950
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,740
Yeah.

951
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:06,224
Hang on, I'm gonna find a way down.

952
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,902
No, Brenda, don't move.
Don't move!

953
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,220
- Come on.
- I can't.

954
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,144
Brenda, grab my hand.

955
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:38,991
No, no!

956
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:42,741
Thomas!

957
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:46,466
- Brenda!
- I can't reach!

958
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:54,980
Come on!

959
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:57,781
Brenda!

960
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,585
Got you.

961
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,827
We can get down here. Come on.

962
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:34,030
Hey, you hear that?

963
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,706
You all right?

964
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,465
Shit.

965
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,381
Brenda...

966
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:56,470
Yeah, yeah. I know.

967
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,141
Let's just go find Marcus.

968
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:18,421
Okay.

969
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:20,423
Try to blend in.

970
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,943
Are you sure this is the place?

971
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,624
You here for the party?

972
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,101
No.

973
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,142
We're looking for Marcus.
This is his place, isn't it?

974
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,507
This is my place.

975
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:19,349
Are you Marcus?

976
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:22,826
Marcus doesn't live here anymore.

977
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:25,310
Do you know where we can find him?

978
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:29,624
Sure, sure. He's over in Zone B.

979
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,141
Okay. What's Zone B?

980
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,348
It's where they burn the bodies.

981
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,822
Okay, look, has anyone else been
by here...

982
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:41,744
looking for him?

983
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,902
Group of kids around our age?
They had a girl with them.

984
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,710
Dark hair.

985
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:49,831
You know...
I think they might be inside.

986
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:51,861
Here.

987
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:56,584
Drink this.

988
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:59,830
What is it?

989
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,582
The price of admission.

990
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:08,821
Drink it!

991
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,666
Your turn.

992
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,625
All right.

993
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:35,105
You two, enjoy the party.

994
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:54,381
Maybe we should split up.

995
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,263
See if we can find the others.

996
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:00,020
Hey.

997
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:03,388
Don't drink anything else.

998
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,670
That was fun!

999
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:49,340
What?

1000
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:00,745
Brenda?

1001
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:03,667
They're not here.

1002
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:09,582
Okay, well... we should keep looking.

1003
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:11,981
Why?

1004
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,510
We couldn't find the Right Arm anyway.

1005
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,667
Not without Marcus.

1006
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:21,347
Your friends are gone.

1007
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:24,029
It's over.

1008
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:25,941
It's just us now.

1009
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,189
Just try and relax.

1010
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:32,785
Let go.

1011
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,425
How?

1012
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,865
Like this.

1013
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,550
What?

1014
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:04,583
You're not her.

1015
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,261
Brenda.

1016
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,106
Thomas.

1017
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:14,901
Hey.

1018
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:16,985
Hey. Did anyone see you come here?

1019
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:18,420
No, what are you talking about?

1020
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:19,786
We don't have a lot of time.

1021
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:20,981
Thomas, what's wrong?

1022
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:22,744
I just had to see you...

1023
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,704
and just try to explain things before...

1024
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:27,267
Oh, no.

1025
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:28,420
Thomas!

1026
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,507
Just listen to me, okay?

1027
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:33,824
Whatever they tell you about me, whatever they say,
I just need you to know I had to do it.

1028
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,381
Okay?

1029
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,390
What did you do?

1030
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,826
I just couldn't keep watching them die.

1031
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:42,900
Over here!

1032
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:43,980
Come on.

1033
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:44,788
No!

1034
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:46,271
I'm sorry.

1035
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:47,660
Thomas!

1036
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:50,622
Hey, you're okay.

1037
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,181
Hi.

1038
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,221
We have to stop meeting like this.

1039
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,464
Welcome back, you ugly shank.

1040
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:10,911
I suggest that you talk!
You son of a bitch!

1041
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:12,940
Damn it!

1042
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,222
I'm sorry...

1043
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:16,986
you're going to have to leave my house.

1044
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:19,868
Looks like you've been having fun.

1045
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:23,469
Listen. I don't enjoy hurting you.

1046
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,546
Okay?

1047
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:28,582
Where is the Right Arm, Marcus?

1048
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:30,824
Wait, this is Marcus?

1049
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:34,069
The kid catches on quick.

1050
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,786
Are you the brains
of the operation?

1051
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,020
I know you know where they're hiding.

1052
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:44,789
So you tell me,
and I'll make you a deal.

1053
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:47,468
You can come with us.

1054
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:50,146
I burned that bridge a long time ago.

1055
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:54,062
Besides, I made my own deal.

1056
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:59,304
You're the one who taught me,
never miss an opportunity.

1057
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:02,865
What's he talking about?

1058
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:07,822
I'm talking about supply and demand.

1059
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:10,701
WICKED wants all the Immunes they can get.

1060
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:13,065
I help provide that for them.

1061
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:16,022
So I lure the kids in...

1062
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:17,790
they get drunk, they have a good time.

1063
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:21,228
And then, later, WICKED comes in...

1064
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:25,463
they separate the wheat from the chaff.

1065
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:31,545
I changed my mind, <i>hermano.</i>

1066
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:35,903
I do enjoy hurting you.

1067
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,262
Talk! Talk!

1068
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:44,945
Okay! Jesus!

1069
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:47,023
But I'm not making any promises.

1070
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:49,467
These guys like to move around.

1071
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,508
They have an outpost in the mountains.

1072
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,829
But it's a long way away.

1073
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:03,310
You got half of WICKED on your ass.
You're never gonna make it.

1074
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:06,750
Not on foot.

1075
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,150
Where's Bertha?

1076
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,630
Not Bertha.

1077
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,904
Well, I guess we're on foot.

1078
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:54,908
Get down!

1079
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,060
Take cover!

1080
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:03,668
Hey, is everyone okay out there?

1081
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:04,946
We're fine.

1082
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:07,347
Anyone know where
those bloody shots came from?

1083
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:11,147
That son of a bitch, Marcus.
He led us into an ambush.

1084
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:24,550
What do we do?

1085
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:25,901
Here.

1086
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,630
Hold this.

1087
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:29,987
We gotta create a diversion.

1088
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,585
You get ready to chuck it.

1089
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:37,149
Everybody!

1090
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,740
Get set to sprint back to the truck!

1091
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:40,424
And hold your ears!

1092
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:42,983
Ready? One...

1093
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,301
Two...

1094
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:47,901
Drop it.

1095
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:52,421
Now!

1096
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,500
I said drop it!

1097
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:02,989
On your feet. Let's go.

1098
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:06,511
Let's go! Move!

1099
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,350
- Back up!
- Easy.

1100
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,261
You two, over here now!

1101
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:13,026
- Come on, let's go!
- Don't be stupid! Move.

1102
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:15,951
Slowly.

1103
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:20,980
Aris?

1104
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:25,620
Oh, my God. Harriet?

1105
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:27,987
My God.
What the hell are you doing here?

1106
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:32,860
Sonya.

1107
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,227
Aris, you're lucky we didn't
shoot your dumb ass.

1108
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:37,311
You all right, man?

1109
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:38,461
How...?

1110
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:39,985
What's happening?

1111
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:41,984
We were in the maze together.

1112
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:48,666
We're clear, guys! Come on out!

1113
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:50,470
Copy that! We're clear!

1114
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,310
Stand down!

1115
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,548
My God, you're alive.

1116
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:06,026
Back it up, Joe!

1117
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:07,511
Back it up!

1118
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:15,664
We're taking them to base.

1119
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:18,505
Wait, so, how did you guys get here?

1120
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,263
- The Right Arm got us out.
- Wait.

1121
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:25,504
The Right Arm?
Do you know where they are?

1122
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:29,021
Hop in.

1123
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:11,302
They've been planning this
for over a year now.

1124
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:13,790
This is all for us.

1125
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:15,783
You guys are lucky you found us
when you did.

1126
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:17,942
We're moving out at first light.

1127
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:18,942
Where's Vince?

1128
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:20,590
Somewhere over there, I think.

1129
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,666
Who's Vince?

1130
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:26,461
He's the one who decides
if you get to stay.

1131
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,500
I thought the Right Arm
was supposed to be an army.

1132
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:31,509
Yeah, we were.

1133
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:34,828
This is all that's left of us.

1134
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:41,746
Lot of good people died
getting us this far.

1135
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:44,946
Who are they?

1136
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,670
They're Immunes.

1137
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:48,783
Caught 'em coming up the mountain.

1138
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:50,945
Did you check 'em?

1139
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:55,262
I know this guy, Aris. I trust him.

1140
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:57,944
Well, I don't. Check 'em.

1141
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:00,871
Hey, boss...

1142
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,264
Brenda! Brenda!

1143
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:06,470
What's going on?

1144
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:09,509
Brenda! Brenda.

1145
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:12,948
- Brenda, talk to me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1146
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,306
What's going on with her?

1147
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:16,622
I don't know.
Brenda, are you all right?

1148
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:18,260
- Brenda? Talk to me.
- What the hell?

1149
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:20,822
Shit!

1150
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:22,226
- Crank! We got a Crank!
- No!

1151
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:23,870
- No!
- Wait, wait!

1152
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:25,630
- Step back!
- Listen, okay?

1153
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:27,740
This just happened, okay?
She's not dangerous yet.

1154
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:28,986
You shouldn't have brought her here!

1155
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:30,140
I know.

1156
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:32,223
We let Cranks in here now,
the safe haven doesn't last a week!

1157
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:34,189
- Step back!
- I understand, okay?

1158
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:35,671
I understand.

1159
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:36,981
Just listen. Please.

1160
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:39,302
Please, okay?
I told her that you could help.

1161
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:41,864
Okay? No.

1162
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:44,064
There's got to be something you can do.

1163
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:49,426
Yeah, there is.

1164
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:55,300
- I can put her out of her misery.
- No!

1165
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:56,228
No!

1166
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:58,986
Vince, that's enough! Let him go.

1167
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:01,425
Let him go!

1168
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:06,070
She's infected, Doc.
There's nothing we can do for her.

1169
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:08,666
No, but he can.

1170
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:12,910
Hello, Thomas.

1171
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:16,387
What?

1172
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:20,024
You know me?

1173
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:22,541
Interesting.

1174
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:26,741
It makes sense
they'd put you in the maze.

1175
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:29,430
Though I must admit...

1176
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,585
I was worried they'd kill you
after what you did.

1177
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:35,905
What I did?

1178
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:42,700
The first time we spoke,
you said you couldn't take it anymore...

1179
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:45,621
watching your friends die, one by one.

1180
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:48,949
The last time we spoke...

1181
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:52,900
you gave me the coordinates
of every WICKED compound, trial and lab.

1182
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:57,064
He was our source.

1183
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,986
We couldn't have pulled
all this off without him.

1184
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:03,945
Take her to the tent.

1185
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:06,582
Get these guys some warm clothes.

1186
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:08,588
Careful.

1187
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:10,265
Come on.

1188
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:17,306
Hey, it's the least we can do.

1189
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,908
Thomas, come on.

1190
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:23,423
I need to get some blood from you.

1191
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:33,026
In the beginning, we were lost.

1192
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:36,267
All we knew for sure...

1193
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:39,822
was that the younger you were,
the stronger your chances.

1194
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:42,310
You worked for WICKED?

1195
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:46,788
Long time ago.

1196
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:49,781
You know, at first,
we had the best intentions.

1197
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:52,781
Find a cure, save the world.

1198
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:57,786
It was clear you kids were the key,
because you were immune.

1199
01:38:58,620 --> 01:38:59,951
But why?

1200
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:02,388
Eventually, we found an answer.

1201
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:05,625
An enzyme produced
by the brains of the immune.

1202
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:07,300
Once separated from the bloodstream...

1203
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:10,787
it can serve as a powerful agent
to slow the spread of the virus.

1204
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:14,027
So, you found a cure?

1205
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:15,905
Not exactly.

1206
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:21,709
The enzyme can't be manufactured,
only harvested from the immune.

1207
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:23,700
The young.

1208
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:27,827
Of course, that didn't stop WICKED.

1209
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:29,027
If they had their way...

1210
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:32,070
they'd sacrifice an entire generation.

1211
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:34,905
All for this.

1212
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:37,351
A gift of biology.

1213
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,184
Of evolution.

1214
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:43,187
But one not meant for all of us.

1215
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:02,230
How long will that give her?

1216
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:04,951
It's different for everyone.
A few months maybe.

1217
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,342
But that's the catch, isn't it?

1218
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,945
She'll always need more.

1219
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:14,066
Okay.

1220
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:17,146
Let's go outside. Let them rest.

1221
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:18,861
Let's go.

1222
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:22,025
She'll be fine.

1223
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:32,220
Thomas.

1224
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:36,664
You know she can't come with us, right?

1225
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:35,990
He was my brother.

1226
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:39,668
Hey. Sorry.

1227
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:41,822
Are you okay?
How are you feeling?

1228
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:47,588
You remind me of him.

1229
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:52,791
He always saw the best in people.

1230
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:56,190
Where is he now?

1231
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:05,349
I don't know.

1232
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:09,268
When we were kids...

1233
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:12,185
we were taken in
by one of WICKED's camps.

1234
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:17,668
They gave us a bunch of tests.

1235
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:21,149
They didn't want me.

1236
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:25,350
They wanted him, though.

1237
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:34,263
They didn't even let me say good-bye.

1238
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:42,624
What was his name?

1239
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:48,349
George.

1240
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:05,671
That was Chuck.

1241
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:14,461
How did he die?

1242
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:21,230
Saving my life.

1243
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:37,071
Get some rest.

1244
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:46,230
<i>Hermano.</i>

1245
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:53,423
If anything were to happen to her,
I...

1246
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:55,582
I know, I know.

1247
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:57,943
You should get in there. Go talk to her.

1248
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:04,303
I guess I owe you, now.

1249
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:19,143
So we broke out.
I'm telling the truth.

1250
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:31,748
I wish Alby could've seen all this.

1251
01:44:34,540 --> 01:44:36,065
And Winston.

1252
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:41,386
And Chuck.

1253
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:46,028
He'd be proud of you, you know, Tommy.

1254
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:48,346
Yeah.

1255
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,311
Hey, Aris!

1256
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:55,631
Hey, guys!

1257
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:58,464
I kinda like that kid.

1258
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:02,909
Yeah. I still don't trust him, though.

1259
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,548
Hey, where's Teresa?

1260
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:13,270
She went up there.

1261
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:32,501
Hey. you okay?

1262
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:34,867
What are you doing up here?

1263
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:38,030
Just thinking.

1264
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:43,830
All right, I'll let you be alone.

1265
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:49,303
Do you remember your mother?

1266
01:45:57,620 --> 01:45:59,031
I think so.

1267
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:02,670
I remember mine.

1268
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:07,222
She was a beautiful woman.

1269
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:09,709
Everybody loved her.

1270
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:13,541
And before WICKED, she was all I had.

1271
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:22,789
When she got sick,
I didn't know what to do.

1272
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:27,424
I just kept her locked up. Hidden.

1273
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:30,623
I thought she'd get better.

1274
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:37,907
Every night, she'd make
these awful sounds, like screaming.

1275
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:42,422
And then, one night, she just stopped.

1276
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:45,430
She was finally quiet.

1277
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:50,104
I went down to her room.

1278
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,664
And there was blood everywhere.

1279
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:58,222
But she was just sat there, calm.

1280
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:00,950
She said she was feeling better.

1281
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:04,591
The visions were gone.
She'd taken care of them.

1282
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:09,984
She took her eyes out, Thomas.

1283
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:16,461
There are millions of people
suffering out there.

1284
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:19,066
Millions of stories, just like mine.

1285
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:25,261
We can't turn our backs on them.

1286
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:28,025
I won't.

1287
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:33,671
What are you saying?

1288
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:37,791
I'm saying, I want you to understand.

1289
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,150
Understand what?

1290
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:44,391
Why I did it.

1291
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:57,226
Teresa...

1292
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:00,062
Please don't fight them, Thomas.

1293
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:02,871
What have you done?

1294
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:07,029
What have you done?

1295
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,389
No!

1296
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:51,585
All right, drop in, boys. Round 'em up.

1297
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:09,151
Go, go!

1298
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:12,381
Take 'em out!

1299
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,540
Tyson!

1300
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:21,184
- Stop!
- Don't move!

1301
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:24,111
Where's Thomas?

1302
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:27,748
Harriet! Ammo!

1303
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:30,586
Vince! Harriet!

1304
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:32,185
- Come on!
- Over here!

1305
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:33,340
How can we help?

1306
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:35,189
You need to cover us!

1307
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:37,391
Ammo!

1308
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:40,147
Hey! Do you know how to use this thing?

1309
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:41,301
Cover me!

1310
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:43,269
This fifty's our only chance!

1311
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:55,301
Brenda!

1312
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:03,066
You dumbass.

1313
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:04,220
Come on!

1314
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:06,868
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

1315
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:10,382
We gotta take cover!

1316
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:12,827
We have to go.
Now, while we still have the chance.

1317
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:14,060
I gotta go find the others.

1318
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:16,786
No! Look! Look.

1319
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:18,869
You can't help them.

1320
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:25,349
Vince, hurry up!
There's too many of them.

1321
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:32,180
I'm out!

1322
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:36,665
Look out!

1323
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:37,980
Shit!

1324
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:47,820
All right, take me down.

1325
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,502
Shit. Shit.

1326
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:57,345
I'm sorry.

1327
01:50:58,020 --> 01:50:59,620
There's just nothing
you can do for them.

1328
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:03,710
If we don't move now,
we won't be much better off.

1329
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:08,510
You guys gotta go right now.

1330
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:09,660
What?

1331
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:12,380
They're not looking for you.
You'll be safe, but you have to go now.

1332
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:14,026
Thomas...

1333
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:20,589
I can't leave without them.

1334
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:24,381
Go.

1335
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:27,711
Good luck, kid.

1336
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:32,068
Bren, we have to go. Come on. Come on.

1337
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,464
Let's go, come on. Come on!

1338
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:02,340
Let's go, let's go!

1339
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:10,148
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1340
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:17,986
Line them up right here! On their knees!
Put some eyes up on that ridge.

1341
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,026
B-4.

1342
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:23,581
How many did we get?

1343
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:25,344
All of them. Give or take.

1344
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:26,547
Give or take what?

1345
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:28,270
Well, they lost a few.

1346
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:32,271
A-4.

1347
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:36,261
A-6.

1348
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:42,261
B-3.

1349
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:44,864
Where's Thomas?

1350
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:46,749
Right here.

1351
01:52:47,580 --> 01:52:48,786
Freeze!

1352
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:51,620
Go!

1353
01:52:57,580 --> 01:52:58,741
Thomas.

1354
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:03,065
Get him in line.

1355
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:11,467
Okay.

1356
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:15,460
Bring her in.

1357
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:20,824
Why didn't you run?

1358
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:26,509
I'm tired of running.

1359
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:26,341
Is this all of them?

1360
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:27,990
Most of them.

1361
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:29,901
It'll be enough.

1362
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:31,461
Start loading them in.

1363
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:32,781
Yes, ma'am.

1364
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:34,220
Okay, you heard. Let's go!

1365
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:35,461
Get 'em on!

1366
01:54:45,220 --> 01:54:46,904
Hello, Thomas.

1367
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:56,388
I'm glad you're safe.

1368
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:58,341
What the hell?

1369
01:54:58,900 --> 01:54:59,901
Teresa?

1370
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:01,870
Wait, what's going on?

1371
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:03,661
She's with them.

1372
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:06,901
Since when?

1373
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:11,344
Teresa's always had an evolved
appreciation of the greater good.

1374
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:16,267
Once we restored her memories,
it was only a matter of time.

1375
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:21,221
Let's go, let's go.

1376
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:22,711
I'm sorry.

1377
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:27,063
I had no choice.
This is the only way.

1378
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:29,541
We have to find a cure.

1379
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:32,943
She's right.
This is all just a means to an end.

1380
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:35,068
You used to understand that, Thomas.

1381
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:37,429
No matter what you think of me...

1382
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:39,548
I am not a monster. I'm a doctor.

1383
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:42,306
I swore an oath to find a cure!

1384
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:44,146
No matter the cost.

1385
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:50,147
I just need more time.

1386
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:52,584
More blood.

1387
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:57,465
Hello, Mary.

1388
01:55:57,940 --> 01:55:59,988
I hoped we'd meet again.

1389
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:02,142
I'm sorry it had to be
under these circumstances.

1390
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:06,990
I'm sorry about a lot of things, too.
But not this.

1391
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:10,741
At least my conscience is clear.

1392
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:14,504
So is mine.

1393
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:20,583
Mary? Mary?

1394
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:21,940
Mary!

1395
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:25,987
Mary! Mary!

1396
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:28,345
Get off me!

1397
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:30,624
Mary? Mary?

1398
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:31,780
Mary?

1399
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:34,586
Mary?

1400
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:36,866
No!

1401
01:56:38,140 --> 01:56:40,427
Mary! No!

1402
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:42,666
Come on, Janson.

1403
01:56:42,860 --> 01:56:44,624
Load them up. Let's go.

1404
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:47,266
All these people. Get rid of them.

1405
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:48,865
Let's go. Let's go!

1406
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:49,989
Let go of me!

1407
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:51,141
Sonya! Aris!

1408
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:54,348
Get back!

1409
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:55,701
Everyone, stand back!

1410
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:58,103
- Stand back!
- Hold your fire!

1411
01:56:58,260 --> 01:56:59,860
- Everyone, stand back!
- Hold your fire!

1412
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:02,466
- Stand back. Let 'em go.
- Thomas, put it down.

1413
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:04,748
- Let 'em all go!
- You know I can't do that!

1414
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,390
Thomas, please stop.

1415
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:10,067
I made a deal with them.
They promised we'd be safe. All of us.

1416
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:11,631
And I'm supposed to trust you now?

1417
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:13,862
It's true. It was her only condition.

1418
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:15,141
Shut up!

1419
01:57:15,380 --> 01:57:17,542
Everything can go back
to the way it was.

1420
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:19,461
Thomas...

1421
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:21,950
do you really want
all of them to die?

1422
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:26,111
Listen to her, Thomas.
Think about what you're doing.

1423
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:37,828
We're with you, Thomas.

1424
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:39,906
No.

1425
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:41,621
Don't.

1426
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:43,750
- Do it, Thomas.
- We're ready.

1427
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:46,740
We're not going back there.

1428
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:48,461
Thomas?

1429
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:50,904
It's the only way.

1430
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:54,140
Thomas!

1431
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:18,142
- Come on. Come on!
- Get her out of here!

1432
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:20,620
You good?

1433
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:22,669
Freeze! Drop it, kid!

1434
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:26,310
Run! Get down!

1435
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:37,626
Freeze!

1436
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:48,106
What a waste.

1437
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:05,982
Vince, go!

1438
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:08,426
Now!

1439
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:22,831
Keep going. I got you.

1440
01:59:30,780 --> 01:59:32,987
Get outta here! Go! Go!

1441
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,945
Come on, Thomas! Get outta here!

1442
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:37,101
Minho, let's go!

1443
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:38,421
Get out of here! Go!

1444
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:41,021
Get down!

1445
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:48,540
Minho!

1446
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:53,869
Minho!

1447
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:55,021
Come back!

1448
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:01,027
- Thomas, get back!
- No! Thomas, no!

1449
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:02,340
Minho!

1450
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:05,020
Thomas!

1451
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:08,901
Minho!

1452
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:10,985
Go! Come on!

1453
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:13,347
Minho!

1454
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:37,669
What do we do now?

1455
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:43,187
Well, we pick up what's left of us.

1456
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:45,541
We stick to the plan.

1457
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:47,862
We get you kids to the safe haven.

1458
02:01:56,540 --> 02:01:58,941
Then we start over, I guess.

1459
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:08,544
I'm not going with you.

1460
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:12,581
What?

1461
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:16,421
I made a promise to Minho.

1462
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:19,108
I wouldn't leave him behind.
I have to go after him.

1463
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:23,470
Hey, kid, look around you.

1464
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:26,140
All right?
WICKED just kicked our ass.

1465
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:30,747
You think about where you're headed.

1466
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:33,911
I'm not asking anyone to come with me.

1467
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:36,585
Thomas, listen to me.

1468
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:42,665
I've known Minho for...
Well, as long as I can remember.

1469
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:46,700
So, if there was any way
that we could help him...

1470
02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:49,545
trust me,
I would be up there standing next to you.

1471
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:51,941
This, what you're talking about...

1472
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:54,384
is impossible.

1473
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:58,062
More like suicide.

1474
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:02,226
Maybe.

1475
02:03:03,580 --> 02:03:05,821
But I know what I'm supposed to do now.

1476
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:12,225
It's not just about Minho.
It's about all of us.

1477
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:15,822
It's about everyone WICKED's ever taken,
everyone they will take.

1478
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:19,151
They'll never stop.

1479
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:25,583
They'll never stop,
so I'm gonna stop them.

1480
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:31,785
I'm gonna kill Ava Paige.

1481
02:03:35,740 --> 02:03:37,265
I have to admit...

1482
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:41,502
I'd like some revenge.

1483
02:03:46,780 --> 02:03:49,021
Well, that's a good speech, kid.

1484
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:52,504
So, what's your plan?

1485
02:03:53,305 --> 02:04:53,370
