Hyperspace tracking is new tech

558
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,966
but the principle must be
the same as any active tracker.

559
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,690
- They're only tracking us...
- Only tracking us...

560
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,166
BOTH: ...from the lead ship.

561
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,720
But we can't get to the tracker.

562
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,920
It's an A-class process,
they'll control it from the main bridge.

563
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,331
Well, I mean, yes,
but every A-class process...

564
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,881
BOTH: ...has a dedicated power breaker.

565
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,961
But... Wait, but who knows where
the breaker room is on a Star Destroyer?

I'm the guy that used to mop it.

If I can get us there,
I can shut their tracker down.

568

Just give it to me one more time, simpler.

569
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,122
So, the First Order's only tracking us
from one Destroyer, the lead one.

570
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,361
So we blow that one up?

I like where your head's at, but no.

572
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,610

from another Destroyer.

ROSE: But if we can...

574
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,000
If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer
and disable the tracker

575
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,286
without them realizing, then we can...

576
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,522
They won't realize it's off
for one system cycle.

we need you to bring the Jedi back

830
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,404
Now that they're extinct,
the Jedi are romanticized, deified.

But if you strip away the myth
and look at their deeds,

the legacy of the Jedi is failure.

they allowed Darth Sidious to rise

837

You believed that he wasn't gone.
That he could be turned.

I thought I could train him,
I could pass on my strengths.
