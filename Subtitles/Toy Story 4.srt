1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,390
Whoa! It's raining cats
and dogs out there!

3
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,119
I hope they make it back
all right.

4
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,350
Heads up! Andy's coming!

5
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,039
Andy, time for dinner.

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,519
Yes! I'm starving!

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,656
Don't forget
to wash your hands!

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Okay, Mom!

9
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,559
- Do you see him?
- No.

10
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,909
Well, he's done for.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,149
He'll be lost! Forever!

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,992
Jessie. Buzz. Slink.
Molly's room.

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,276
The rest of you, stay put.

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Bo!

15
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,920
Situation?

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,993
Lost toy. Side yard.

17
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,355
Billy. Goat. Gruff.
Raise the blinds.

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,440
They have names?
You never told me that.

19
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
You never asked.

20
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
Where is he?

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,155
There!

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,280
How do we reach him?

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,753
Operation Pull-Toy!

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,353
- Slink!
- You got it, Woody!

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,993
Barbies!

26
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Go!

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,955
Flashlight.

28
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,108
Hang on, R.C.!

29
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,034
I ain't got any more slink!

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,874
Oh, it's beautiful.

31
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,016
I'm so glad to see

32
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,439
this old lamp
go to a good home.

33
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,079
We've had it since
Molly was a baby.

34
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,999
Molly, are you sure
it's all right?

35
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,496
Yeah,
I don't want it anymore.

36
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,873
Thank you.

37
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,909
Where's Woody?

38
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,311
Yeah, hi.
I think I left my keys here.

39
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,115
- Woody.
- Quick!

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,880
We'll sneak in the hedges
before he's back.

41
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,871
Woody, it's okay.

42
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,110
What? No! No, no, no.
You can't go!

43
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,376
What's best for Andy
is that...

44
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,469
Woody.

45
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,318
I'm not Andy's toy.

46
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,673
What?

47
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,637
It's time for the next kid.

48
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,456
Oh, and thank you again
for everything.

49
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,549
I really appreciate it.

50
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,949
Oh, my pleasure.
I'm glad it all worked out.

51
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,276
You know, kids lose
their toys every day.

52
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,950
Sometimes they get
left in the yard...

53
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,916
or put in the wrong box.

54
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,112
And that box gets taken away.

55
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,395
Mom, where's Woody?

56
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,158
Andy! Come inside!

57
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
I can't find Woody!

58
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,749
Well, good night.

59
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,671
Goodbye.
Drive safe.

60
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,596
Oh, there you are.

61
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,678
Mom, I found him! I found him!

62
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,513
Oh, good.
Come on and get inside.

63
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,510
You've got a friend in me

64
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,790
Reach for the sky!

65
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,428
You've got a friend in me

66
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,951
Ride 'em, cowboy! Yee-haw!

67
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,720
When the road looks
rough ahead

68
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,472
There's a snake in my boot.

69
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,520
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed

70
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,677
You just remember
what your old pal said

71
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,831
Boy, you've got a friend in me

72
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,353
To infinity and beyond!

73
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,316
Yeah, you've got
a friend in me

74
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,271
My cowboy!

75
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,000
Now, some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

76
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,354
Big and stronger, too

77
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,032
Woody, let's go!

78
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Maybe

79
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,351
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do

80
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,192
You're my favorite deputy!

81
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,394
It's me and you, boy

82
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,949
And as the years go by

83
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,194
Our friendship will never die

84
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,191
Reach for the sky!

85
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,039
You're gonna see
it's our destiny

86
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,634
They've escaped and they're
headed right for us!

87
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,994
You've got a friend in me

88
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,438
- Full speed ahead! Yay!
- You've got a friend in me

89
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,398
You've got a friend in me

90
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,656
It's getting hot in here!

91
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,776
Where's my ear?

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
You're on my foot!

93
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,936
Oh, hey,
quit shoving.

94
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,016
- Sorry!
- Could you move over

95
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,440
- a bit, please?
- That was my horn.

96
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,896
To infinity and beyond!

97
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,200
I know that was you,
Potato Head.

98
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,872
Everyone, listen.
I thought I told you...

99
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,951
when Mom quickly cleans
the bedroom like that...

100
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,792
expect to be put
in the closet.

101
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,598
How much longer?

102
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,079
Keep it to a dull roar, Rex.

103
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,872
Deep breaths, Jessie.
Deep breaths.

104
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,456
Settle down, Slink.

105
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,674
Sit. Good boy!

106
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,976
Sheriff,
do I need to be worried?

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,976
No, no. My guys are veterans.
They'll hang in there.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,036
Good. Just keep them calm
until we get word.

109
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,317
How are you, uh,
feeling about today?

111
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,755
Uh, good, good. Yeah, good.

112
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,029
I'm good.

113
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,639
Uh... Good.

114
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,791
We're on!
Bonnie's done with breakfast!

115
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,313
- Any minute now.
- You hear that?

116
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,594
Any minute now.

117
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,749
Wind 'em if you got 'em.

118
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,800
Keep your batteries clean,
your joints unlocked...

119
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,960
Uh, thanks, Woody.
I got it.

120
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,270
Yes, I'm sorry.
You're right, you're right.

121
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,988
The town is open!

122
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Hi, Mayor!

123
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Banker!

124
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,838
Hi, Ice-Cream Man!
Hi, Hat Shop Owner!

125
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,354
Mailman!

126
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,998
And the sheriff!

127
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,671
Okay. Bye, toys!

128
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,637
Yee-haw! Sheriff Jessie!

129
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,472
Giddy-up, Bullseye!

130
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,674
They went that way!

131
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,995
Chase them!

132
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,828
What a beautiful hat shop!
You have so many hats...

133
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,536
Wow.
They're doing "hat shop."

134
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,816
When's the last time

135
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,875
we ever got to play that?

136
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,393
Remember when
she played "house"?

137
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,515
I liked "house."

138
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,795
Those were the days.

139
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,313
It was basic.
You made a house,

140
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
you lived in it, done.

141
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,153
Hmm. That's the third time

142
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,560
you haven't been picked
this week.

143
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,953
I don't know.
I don't keep count.

144
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,758
Oh, you don't have to.

145
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,856
- I'll do it for you.
- Okay, okay, okay, I get it.

146
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
It's been a while.

147
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,508
Oh, looky there.
You got your first dust bunny.

148
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,673
Aw, how adorable.

149
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,875
What you gonna name it?

150
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
Uh, what about Dusty?

151
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,296
- Francis!
- Harry!

152
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,416
- Karen!
- Fuzzball!

153
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,509
- LeBron?
- No, Fluffy.

154
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,176
- How about Thumper?
- Tumbleweed!

155
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,880
"Tumbleweed."
Oh, that's good. That's good.

156
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,016
He's a cowboy,

157
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,176
so that makes a lot of sense.

158
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,918
So many choices.

159
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,274
I just can't decide!

160
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Bonnie?

161
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,714
What are you doing?
We gotta go.

162
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
You don't wanna be late

163
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,136
for kindergarten orientation,
do you?

164
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,355
But I don't wanna go.

165
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,936
We talked about this.

166
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,188
We're gonna meet
your teachers,

167
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,111
- see your classroom...
- Can I bring a toy?

168
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,033
Toys don't go to school,
that's the rule.

169
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,428
Freeze! Nobody move!

170
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,840
Bonnie always
forgets something.

171
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,234
She'll be back any second.

172
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,594
That goes for you, too, Hamm.

173
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
But it's money!

174
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
You all right, Woody?

175
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,856
I'm sure she'll pick you
next time.

176
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,871
Oh, come on, I'm fine.
No problem.

177
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,149
Hey, Woody. Here.

178
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,309
Oh, thanks, Jessie.

179
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,118
We're here for you, buddy.

180
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,936
I don't want to play
the baker.

181
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Pricklepants.

182
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,076
The hat shop owner is
the role I was born to play!

183
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,776
All right, Pricklepants,
back to your bakery.

184
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Excuse me, Dolly?

185
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,296
Woody, can't you see
I'm threatening everyone?

186
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Go back to the closet.

187
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,456
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's just...

188
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,674
I'm worried about Bonnie.

189
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,557
A toy should go with her
to orientation.

190
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,680
Didn't you hear Dad?
You'll get Bonnie in trouble.

191
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,512
Yeah, but kindergarten
is so different.

192
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,193
It can be too much for a kid.

193
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,616
Having a buddy with them
to get through it

194
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
can really help things.

195
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,416
I remember with Andy, I would
go to school with him...

196
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,475
Uh-huh. I'm sorry, Woody,

197
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,736
I hate to sound
like a broken record...

198
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,113
but Bonnie's not Andy.

199
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,673
No, no, no, of course,
I get that.

200
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,954
But if you would just...

201
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,593
Places, everyone!

202
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,514
Bonnie?

203
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,832
What are you doing back there?

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,070
Come on, we have to go.

205
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,878
That's my big girl.

206
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,474
Come on. We gotta hurry, okay?

207
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,231
Don't forget your backpack.

208
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,000
You're gonna
have so much fun.

209
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,552
All right. Now what was it
you were saying, Woody?

210
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,874
Woody?

211
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,072
Here we are.

212
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,830
Bonnie, honey,
it'll be okay.

213
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,070
Hi! Are you Bonnie?

214
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
My name is Miss Wendy.

215
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,120
I'm going to be
your kindergarten teacher.

216
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,078
We have a special place where
you can put your backpack.

217
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,072
You want to see?

218
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,991
Here we are, Bonnie.
Just for you.

219
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,549
Okay, class, let's all find
a seat at a table...

220
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,955
so we can start craft time.

221
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,348
On the first day of school,

222
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,510
you'll need a place
to put your pencils.

223
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,877
So, today, we're going
to make pencil holders.

224
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,359
Now, everyone take a cup...

225
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,592
and we'll use the art supplies
to decorate them.

226
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,275
Hi.

227
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,674
Bonnie. That is so clever.

228
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,792
"Hello, I'm Forky.
Nice to meet you!"

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,672
Well, hello, Forky,
it's nice to meet you.

230
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,193
I'm Miss Wendy.

231
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,110
Mom! Dad!
Look what I made!

232
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,515
His name is Forky!

233
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,033
- Wow!
- That is so cool!

234
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,872
I finished kindergarten!

235
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,280
Uh...

236
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,828
No.
That was just orientation.

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,399
But for being
such a brave girl,

238
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,754
we have a surprise for you.

239
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
What is it?

240
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,056
Since school doesn't start

241
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,548
for another week,
we are going on a road trip!

242
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,696
- Can I bring Forky?
- 'Course you can!

243
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,039
Yay!

244
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,032
And they said I shouldn't
go to school with Bonnie.

245
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,069
We got this kindergarten thing
under control, eh?

246
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,080
I can't believe
I'm talking to a spork.

247
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,559
Hi, toys!
Bye, toys!

248
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,834
Ow.

249
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,114
He did go to kindergarten!

250
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,616
- I knew it.
- No, no, no, guys, listen...

251
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,696
You tryin' to get
Bonnie in trouble?

252
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,835
No, of course not!

253
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,056
You could have been
confiscated.

254
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,957
- What does that mean?
- Taken away.

255
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,189
- No!
- Or worse.

256
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
You could've been lost!

257
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
No, no, no, guys, listen.

258
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,153
Bonnie had a great day
in class...

259
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,560
and we're going
on a road trip.

260
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,994
- Road trip?
- Vacation!

261
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,269
Yee-haw!

262
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,040
But then something
really weird happened.

263
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,798
Bonnie made a friend in class.

264
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
What a kid.

265
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,216
Oh, she's already
making friends.

266
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,152
No, no. She literally made
a new friend.

267
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,192
Hey, it's okay.

268
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,396
Come on out. That's it.

269
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,357
Come on, there you go.

270
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,557
Come on,
let's get you out of there.

271
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,113
You got this.

272
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,031
Good. Good.

273
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,272
Everyone, I want you
to meet Forky.

274
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,096
- Golly bob howdy!
- Look at that!

275
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,350
Look how long his arms are!

276
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,118
- Trash?
- No.

277
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,157
No, toys.

278
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,237
They're all toys.

279
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,519
- Trash?
- No, no, no.

280
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,636
That's the trash.

281
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,949
These are your friends.

282
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,593
Hi!

283
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,074
Trash!

284
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,576
- No, no, it's okay.
- Trash!

285
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,880
Woody,
I have a question.

286
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,680
Um, well, actually,
not just one,

287
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,795
I have all of them.

288
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,513
I have all the questions.

289
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,096
Uh, why does he want
to go to the trash?

290
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,320
Because he was made
from trash.

291
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Trash!

292
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,920
Look, I know
this is a little strange,

293
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
but you gotta trust me
on this.

294
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
Trash?

295
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,995
Forky is the most important
toy to Bonnie right now.

296
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,280
Important?

297
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,389
He's a spork.

298
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,198
Yes. Yeah, I know,
but this spork...

299
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,590
this toy is crucial to Bonnie

300
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,830
getting adjusted
to kindergarten. Oh.

301
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,035
Woody, aren't you being

302
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,256
a little dramatic
about all this?

303
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,759
I know this is new
to everybody...

304
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,034
but you should see how much

305
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,599
this little guy
means to Bonnie.

306
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,274
When she started
playing with him...

307
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,476
she had the biggest smile
on her face.

308
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,840
I wish you could have seen it.

309
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,000
Bonnie was really upset...

310
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,713
and I swear,
once she made Forky...

311
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,472
it was
a complete transformation.

312
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,710
- Uh, Woody?
- Just a second, Jessie.

313
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,435
So, we all have to make sure
nothing happens to him.

314
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,352
Something happened to him.

315
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,359
Oh, Chutes and Ladders!

316
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Ah, trash.

317
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,776
- No, no, no!
- No! No!

318
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,136
You're a toy now,
Forky! Come on!

319
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,229
Stop! Stop it!

320
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,856
- Hey! No, no, no! Come on!
- Trash!

321
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,096
Trash! Trash!

322
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,350
Well, I guess
I'll just babysit him

323
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,754
till he's used to the room.

324
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,474
Hmm.

325
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,234
Forky?

326
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,038
Where are you, Forky?

327
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,789
There you are!

328
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,916
I thought I'd lost you, silly.

329
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,154
No, no, no.
Big girl scary!

330
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,880
Like I said before,
Bonnie's not scary.

331
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,792
She loves you
and you need to...

332
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,108
Ooh.

333
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,953
Forky?

334
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,113
Bonnie!

335
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
Let's go!

336
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,790
Rise and shine!

337
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,552
Who wants to go
on a road trip?

338
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,154
Me! I'm gonna bring
Dolly, and Buttercup...

339
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,151
and Forky, and...

340
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,072
Forky? Where are you?

341
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,576
He's gotta be
here somewhere.

342
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Forky?

343
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Forky!

344
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,480
Come on. Let's eat some
breakfast and hit the road!

345
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,113
Let's go, Forky!

346
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,272
Whoa. He's quite
a handful, Woody.

347
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,040
You need help with him
on the road trip?

348
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,714
No. No, no. I got it,
I got it.

349
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,957
We'll just be stuck in an RV.

350
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,792
He can't get far.
I got this.

351
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,880
I got it.

352
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,398
I can't let you

353
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,751
I can't let you

354
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,431
I can't let you
throw yourself away

355
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,111
- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you

356
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,236
I can't let you
throw yourself away

357
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,956
Don't you want to see
the sun come up each morning?

358
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,792
No, no!

359
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,269
Don't you want to see
the sun go down each day?

360
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,949
Don't you want to see that
little girl that loves you so?

361
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,712
Her heart would break

362
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,869
Oh, yeah!

363
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,439
If you should go

364
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,677
- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you

365
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,016
I can't let you
throw yourself away

366
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,075
No, no, no!

367
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
No! No! No!

368
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,632
So it seems to me like you're
never gonna behave yourself

369
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,313
Since I'm not gonna
do this every day

370
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,628
Come tomorrow, you're gonna
have to save yourself

371
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,756
Got nothing more to say

372
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,593
You're not listening anyway

373
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,878
- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you

374
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,056
Trash, here I come!

375
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,216
I can't let you
throw yourself away

376
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,389
Come on.

377
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,318
I can't let you

378
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,952
I can't let you

379
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,376
I can't let you
throw yourself away

380
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,356
I don't wanna be a toy!

381
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,998
- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you

382
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,789
I can't let you
throw yourself away

383
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,069
Hey, buddy.

384
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,508
Hey, Buzz.

385
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,228
You doing okay?

386
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
I don't know, Buzz.

387
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,755
I know you weren't around
when Andy was little...

388
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,559
but I don't remember it
being this hard.

389
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,639
Want me to take
the next watch?

390
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,760
I'll keep an eye on Forky.

391
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,917
No, no. I need to do this.

392
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,229
That little voice inside me

393
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,436
would never leave me alone
if I gave up.

394
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,915
Huh.

395
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,473
Who do you think it is?

396
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,709
Who?

397
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,394
The voice inside of you.
Who do you think it is?

398
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,315
Uh...

399
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,675
Me.

400
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,114
You know, my conscience?

401
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,148
That part of you
that tells you things?

402
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
What you're really thinking?

403
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,279
Fascinating.

404
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,113
So, your inner voice
advises you.

405
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
What?

406
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,280
It's a secret
mission in uncharted space.

407
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Let's go.

408
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Where's Forky?

409
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,954
Oh, no!
Forky!

410
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,995
Forky!

411
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,594
I am not a toy!

412
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,874
I'm a spork.

413
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Be quiet!

414
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,439
I was made for soup, salad...

415
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,636
maybe chili,
and then the trash.

416
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,074
I'm litter!

417
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Freedom!

418
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,672
Hamm, how far
to our next stop?

419
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,478
5.32 miles, give or take.

420
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,675
I can make that.

421
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,068
I'll meet you at the RV park.

422
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,071
Woody, hold on a minute.
Woody!

423
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,873
Forky!

424
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,475
Forky, where are you?

425
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,073
Forky!

426
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,593
Forky, where are you?

427
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,478
- Carry me?
- No.

428
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,872
Why do I have to be a toy?

429
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,176
Because you have Bonnie's name

430
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,713
written on the bottom
of your sticks.

431
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,960
Why do I have Bonnie's name

432
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,598
written on the bottom
of my sticks?

433
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,034
Because she...

434
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,349
Look, she plays with you
all the time, right?

435
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,714
Ugh. Yes.

436
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,751
And who does she sleep with
every night?

437
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,148
The big white fluffy thing?

438
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,594
No, not her pillow.

439
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,028
You.

440
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,997
All right, Forky.

441
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,675
You have to understand
how lucky you are right now.

442
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,989
You're Bonnie's toy.

443
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,355
You are going to help create
happy memories...

444
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,596
that will last
for the rest of her life.

445
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,955
Huh? What?

446
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,233
Okay.
Doing it for Bonnie.

447
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,391
Doing this for Bonnie,
you're doing it for Bonnie.

448
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,711
Okay, like it or not,
you are a toy.

449
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,393
Maybe you don't like
being one,

450
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,674
but you are one nonetheless.

451
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,988
Which means you are going

452
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,280
to be there for Andy
when he...

453
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,594
Who's Andy?

454
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,515
I mean, Bonnie.

455
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,272
You have to be there
for Bonnie.

456
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,112
That is your job.

457
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,554
Well, what's your job?

458
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,910
Well, right now, it's to make
sure you do yours.

459
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,672
- Carry me?
- No!

460
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,909
Who's Andy?

461
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,631
Andy was my other kid.

462
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,991
You had another kid?

463
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Yeah, yeah.

464
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,873
For a long time.

465
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,072
And it was pretty great.

466
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,156
I was a favorite toy,
actually.

467
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,470
Running the room was my job.

468
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,039
Keeping all the toys
in place...

469
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,873
So, he thought
Andy's room was a planet?

470
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,752
Wow,
that is messed up.

471
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,875
Right!

472
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,616
That's exactly what I thought
when he first showed up.

473
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,870
Yeah. I mean,
how is that not annoying?

474
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,190
- Thank you!
- Seriously, that is the...

475
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,112
Well, then you
watch 'em grow up

476
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,997
and become a full person.

477
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,552
And then they leave.

478
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,950
They go off and do things
you'll never see.

479
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,959
Don't get me wrong,
you still feel good about it.

480
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,792
But then somehow
you find yourself,

481
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,995
after all those years...

482
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,038
sitting in a closet
just feeling...

483
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,189
Useless?

484
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,269
Yeah.

485
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,317
Your purpose fulfilled?

486
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,512
Exactly.

487
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,272
Woody, I know
what your problem is.

488
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
You do?

489
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,919
You're just like me.

490
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,115
Trash!

491
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,872
What is it with you and trash?

492
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,439
- It's warm.
- Ew.

493
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,874
- It's cozy.
- I guess.

494
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
And safe!

495
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,792
Like somebody's
whispering in your ear,

496
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,313
"Everything's gonna be okay."

497
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,757
Forky, that's it.

498
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,639
That's how Bonnie feels
when she's with you.

499
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,358
- She does?
- Yes!

500
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,795
Wait a sec.

501
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,991
- You mean she thinks I'm warm?
- Yep.

502
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,229
- And cozy?
- Uh-huh.

503
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,714
And sometimes kinda squishy?

504
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,108
Well, that, too. Yes.

505
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,799
I get it now.

506
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,029
I'm Bonnie's trash.

507
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,275
Yes! Wait, what?

508
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,555
I am Bonnie's trash!

509
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
No, no, no, not exactly.

510
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,216
She must be feeling awful
without me.

511
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,536
Woody, we got to get going,
she needs me!

512
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,440
- Yeah... Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!

513
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,795
Forky, slow down! Forky!

514
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,239
Bonnie, I'm coming!

515
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Forky!

516
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,149
Forky, look.
Bonnie's right over there.

517
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,474
Hurry!

518
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,435
Whoo!

519
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,158
Huh? Woody?

520
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,435
Bo?

521
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,754
Woody?

522
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,477
Aren't we going to Bonnie?

523
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,915
I know, I know. But my friend
might be in there.

524
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,189
Friend?

525
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,839
Oh, a friend, uh...

526
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,519
Well, a friend is...

527
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,079
Well, a friend is
like you and me.

528
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,231
- Trash?
- Trash, like... Yes.

529
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,016
And I'm very worried
that she might be lost.

530
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,190
But, Woody,
Bonnie's right there.

531
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,520
Yeah, we'll have you back
before she wakes up. Come on.

532
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,515
Bo?

533
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Bo?

534
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,635
Bo?

535
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,311
- Bo?
- Bo?

536
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Bo?

537
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Bo.

538
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,833
Bo, Bo, Bo...

539
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,958
- Bo?
- Bo?

540
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,114
Can we go back to Bonnie now?

541
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,349
I don't see your friend.

542
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,999
Yeah, okay.

543
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,479
She's not in here.

544
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,834
Come on, let's go.

545
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,315
Is that Bo?

546
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,389
Uh...
Hey, howdy.

547
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,629
Hey there.

548
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,119
Uh, sorry to bother you,
but...

549
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,080
Why,
you're not a bother at all.

550
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,230
We were just out
for my early morning stroll.

551
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,515
And look...

552
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,511
we met you!

553
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,874
My name is Gabby Gabby.

554
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,434
And this is my
very good friend Benson.

555
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,591
Oh, uh, Woody.
Pleasure to meet you.

556
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,035
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Woody. And you are...?

557
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
This is Forky.

558
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,035
I'm trash.

559
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,917
Our kid made him.

560
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,150
Kid? Toys around here
don't have kids.

561
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
Are you two lost?

562
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,391
Lost? No, no.

563
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,273
But we are looking
for a lost toy.

564
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,000
She's a figurine. Used to be
on that lamp in the window?

565
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Name's Bo Peep?

566
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,389
Bo Peep?

567
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,675
- Oh, yes, I know Bo.
- You do?

568
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,120
Hop on in.
We'll take you to her.

569
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,838
Oh, you don't have to do that.

570
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,228
Well, okay.

571
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,795
Benson, be careful
with our new friends.

572
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,039
Wow, what service.

573
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,076
Uh...
Thank you for your help.

574
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,240
I haven't seen Bo in years.

575
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,072
May I ask, when were you made?

576
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,559
Me? Uh...

577
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,432
I'm not sure. Late '50s?

578
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Me, too!

579
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,760
Gee, I wonder if we were made
in the same factory.

580
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,552
Wouldn't that be something?

581
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,631
I gotta say,
you are in great condition.

582
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,837
Well, I try to stay active.

583
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,709
And look at that,
you have a voice box like me.

584
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Benson, show him.

585
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,434
Oh, that's really
not necessary.

586
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,708
I'm Gabby Gabby

587
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,677
and I love you.

588
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,832
Wow, you need to fix that.

589
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,831
My record works just fine.

590
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,712
It's the voice box
that's broken.

591
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
Does yours still work?

592
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Hey!

593
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,560
There's a snake in my boot!

594
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,790
Listen to that!
Let's see it.

595
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,109
I bet it's the same type.

596
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,475
No, thanks,
mine's sewn inside.

597
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,159
Is Bo around here?
Because we need...

598
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,669
Oh.

599
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,113
The store is about to open.

600
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,360
Don't worry, we'll take you
where no one will see us.

601
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,152
Oh, no. We can't stay.

602
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,469
Yes, you can.

603
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,148
We gotta go.

604
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,437
You can't leave yet.
You have what I need.

605
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,512
Right inside there.

606
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,976
Returned that lamp
the next day.

607
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,056
You're kidding me!

608
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,798
Mom, can we go
to the park now?

609
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,995
Harmony!

610
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,317
Stop him, please.

611
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
What's going on?

612
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,074
Come on! Let's go!

613
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,958
He's coming, he's coming!
I see him!

614
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,997
Forky? We got to get out of...

615
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,435
Woody!

616
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,959
I'd like
to join your posse, boys.

617
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,270
But first, I'm gonna sing
a little song.

618
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,992
Grandma, look what I found.

619
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,991
- Can I take it to the park?
- Sure.

620
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,833
Mom, she has enough toys
from the store.

621
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,151
Oh, it's fine.
Nobody buys the toys anyway.

622
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,038
Thanks, Grandma!

623
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,912
Yee-haw!

624
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,632
Mom, can we go
to the carnival?

625
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,240
We're going
to the park.

626
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Maybe later, sweetie.

627
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,675
Any sign of Woody?

628
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,068
- I don't see him!
- Shh!

629
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,136
Maybe we should
have gone with the fork.

630
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
The spoon is safer.

631
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Mmm.

632
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,392
Forky?

633
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,909
Where's Forky?

634
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
Mom! Dad!

635
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,696
- What's wrong, honey?
- Are you okay?

636
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,631
I can't find Forky!
He's missing!

637
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,199
Oh, Bonnie,
it'll be all right.

638
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,032
I'm sure he's here somewhere.

639
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,440
You know,
if you don't find him,

640
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
you can make a new one.

641
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,796
No! There's only one Forky!

642
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,029
Uh...

643
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,394
Let's go look outside.

644
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,960
Maybe he fell on the ground
somewhere.

645
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,669
Oh, poor Bonnie.

646
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,976
We're gonna
find him, okay?

647
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,389
We have to find him,
Mom. He needs me.

648
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,595
Woody was right.

649
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,796
We all should have been
safeguarding the utensil.

650
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,154
Why isn't Woody back yet?

651
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,440
Do you think
he's lost?

652
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,136
- Buzz, what do we do?
- What do we do, Buzz?

653
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,760
Buzz, what do we do?
What do we do, Buzz?

654
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,440
- What do we do, Buzz? Buzz!
- I, uh...

655
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,039
- Buzz.
- What would Woody do?

656
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,720
Eh, jump out
of a moving vehicle.

657
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,472
What would Woody do?

658
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,856
It's a secret mission

659
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,438
in uncharted space. Let's go!

660
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,228
I think I have to go.

661
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,456
- Where?
- Where you goin'? Why?

662
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Should we all go?

663
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,656
- Are we going?
- And then what?

664
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,160
No time to explain!
Attack!

665
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,514
No time to explain!

666
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,875
- Oh, no!
- Buzz!

667
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Okay, what is with everyone
jumping out the window?

668
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,710
Woody and Forky were last seen
on the highway.

669
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,393
But where is the highway?

670
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,896
The slingshot
maneuver is all we've got!

671
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,353
Full speed ahead!

672
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,519
Thanks, inner voice!

673
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,195
Hi-ya!

674
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
The highway.

675
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,639
On my way, Woody!

676
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,268
Rad.

677
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,079
Hey! Step right up!

678
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Put your money down!

679
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,416
Get yourself
a real Buzz Lightyear!

680
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,953
Hey! Hey!

681
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,556
Harmony, honey. Sunscreen.

682
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Okay.

683
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,990
Be right back, Mr. Cowboy.

684
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,919
Okay. Antique store,
antique store...

685
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Oh, that way!

686
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,716
Did you see 'em?
How many are there?

687
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,075
- Whoa, whoa.
- We got a busload of campers!

688
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,116
Here they come!

689
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,840
- Huh?
- Playtime, baby!

690
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,875
Oh, baby!
It's a good day to play, huh?

691
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,155
Am I right?

692
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,595
Huh?

693
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,592
"Hello, Mr. Cowboy.
How are you today?

694
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,557
"Do you like riding horses?"

695
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,158
Wanna play
on the swings?

696
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
Wait for me!

697
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,114
Bo?

698
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,235
Come on.

699
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Bo!

700
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,160
Oh, I can't
believe it's you!

701
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,593
Bo Peep!

702
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,318
I never thought
I'd see you again!

703
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,576
- So, which kid is yours?
- Which one is yours?

704
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,715
- None.
- No one.

705
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,950
- Wait, you're a lost toy?
- You're a lost toy?

706
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,320
- That's awful.
- That's great.

707
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,069
- Huh?
- I mean, awfully great...

708
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,993
that you are lost out here.

709
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,200
- Skunk, skunk, skunk!
- Watch out!

710
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,276
Huh?

711
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,832
I told you
not to drive so fast.

712
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,194
You almost ran him over.

713
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,434
Oh, hey, guys!

714
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,794
Whoa! Hold on there!

715
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,757
Okay!
I missed you, too.

716
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,832
If it isn't Bobby?
Gus?

717
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,955
Uh...

718
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,109
Lefty?

719
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,435
Billy, Goat, and Gruff.

720
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,272
Right! Right! Right!
Sorry, guys.

721
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,112
- Girls.
- Girls! Of course!

722
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,600
All right, all right.

723
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,632
Okay, let's get a look at you.
You need any repairs?

724
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,756
Repairs? No, I'm fine.

725
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,950
Hey! Nice find, girls.

726
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,256
Where did you get
all this stuff?

727
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
Here and there.

728
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,113
You know, some kids
play rougher than others...

729
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,872
so I try
to be prepared.

730
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,560
How long have you been
out on your own?

731
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,352
Seven fantastic years!

732
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,555
Seven?

733
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,029
You would not believe
the things I've seen.

734
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,348
Uh, no.

735
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,595
- Gigs.
- Yo!

736
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,640
Come on out. There's someone
I want you to meet.

737
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,189
Be right down.

738
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,068
What's the situation?
We heading out of town or...

739
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,508
Whoa! Who's this?

740
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,360
You remember the rag doll
I told you about?

741
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,635
- The cowboy?
- Yep!

742
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,473
No way!

743
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,800
- Don't stare.
- I'm totally staring.

744
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,475
Woody,
this is Giggle McDimples.

745
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Oh, hi, Giggle.

746
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,877
Whoa, you didn't tell me
he was a cop.

747
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,189
Howdy, Sheriff.

748
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,839
Officer Giggle McDimples.

749
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,751
I run Pet Patrol
for Mini-Opolis.

750
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,955
Yeah, search and rescue.

751
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,120
Ants, caterpillars,

752
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,896
- miniature poodles, spiders.
- Hut! Hut! Hut!

753
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,512
Carl! Where you headed?

754
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,456
Combat Carl just heard
there's a birthday party...

755
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,913
at the playground
on Main Street.

756
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,672
Rumor has it
they got two piñatas.

757
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,070
- That could be 20 to 30 kids.
- Nice!

758
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,999
Oh, yeah! Combat Carl's
gettin' played with!

759
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
You guys in?

760
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,354
You bet! Woody,
you are gonna love this!

761
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,312
Uh, no, I can't, sir.

762
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,152
Bo, I need to get back
to my kid.

763
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,832
- What?
- You got a kid?

764
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,035
Yeah.

765
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,800
Way to beat
the odds, soldier.

766
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,680
Meet you
at the playground, Peep.

767
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,434
Combat Carl's got
a piñata party to crash.

768
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,795
All right, move out.
Hut! Hut! Hut!

769
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,348
So, you're, uh, with a kid?

770
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
It's not Andy, is it?

771
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,671
No, no, no.
He went off to college.

772
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,637
But he gave us to Bonnie.

773
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,631
- You have a little girl?
- No way!

774
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,199
Yeah, yeah.
It's why I'm out here.

775
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,679
Her other toy is trapped

776
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,976
in this antique store,
and I have to...

777
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,752
Second Chance Antiques?

778
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,148
We know that store.

779
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,759
That's great. That is great!

780
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,478
If you know the store,
you could really

781
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,760
- help me find him...
- No way.

782
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,920
We wasted years there,

783
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,616
just sitting on the shelf,
collecting dust.

784
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,119
Oh, Bo, that's awful.

785
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,349
But I don't have a choice.

786
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,158
I have to get that toy
from Gabby.

787
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,873
Whoa. Steer clear
of that weirdo.

788
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,310
If I were you, I'd cut
my losses and go home.

789
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,516
But Bonnie needs him
to get through kindergarten.

790
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,910
Kids lose toys every day.
Bonnie will get over it.

791
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,559
No, no...

792
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,269
You see, Bonnie needs him
just like Molly needed you.

793
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,239
Aw, no. Sorry, girls.

794
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,760
Molly's not here.

795
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,711
Molly? Bo,
I didn't know you had a kid.

796
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,711
That was a long time ago.

797
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,996
Oh, Bo's kid was
something special.

798
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,798
She was the cutest thing...

799
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,598
but so afraid of the dark.

800
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,353
It was just a phase.

801
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,936
Oh, you weren't there
in the beginning.

802
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,871
Hearing Molly cry
each night...

803
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,190
it broke every toy's heart.

804
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,633
And then,
Bo came into the room.

805
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,588
Her lamp was the only thing
that made Molly feel safe.

806
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,751
Mom would let her keep Bo on
all night.

807
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,717
Ha! Who knew you were
such a softy?

808
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,148
And Molly would fall asleep

809
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,310
with her hand
resting on Bo's feet.

810
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,630
Okay! Okay. I get it.

811
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,554
Bo, my kid really needs
this toy.

812
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,392
Will you help me?
For old times' sake.

813
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,633
All right, all right.

814
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,392
Thank you! Oh!

815
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,640
- Oh, thank you!
- All right.

816
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,512
Guess we're doing this.
Let's ride!

817
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,999
Second Chance Antiques,
and step on it.

818
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,877
Ow!

819
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,508
Hey, hey!

820
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,936
- Benson, are we finished?
- Ow!

821
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,552
Oh, that feels great!

822
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,318
Look at that! Good as new.

823
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,948
Yeah. Thank you, uh, Benson.

824
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,029
Uh, so, um, when's Woody
coming back?

825
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,872
Like I said, soon.

826
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,234
He won't forget about you.

827
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
How do you know?

828
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,114
You have your child's name
written on your feet.

829
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
Sticks.

830
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,675
That makes you
a very important toy.

831
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,398
That's exactly
what Woody says.

832
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,456
Hmm. Interesting.

833
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,656
Hi, Grandma!
We're back!

834
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,680
She's back.

835
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Who is she?

836
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
Harmony.

837
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
Wait a second...

838
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,868
she took Woody.

839
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,314
Did she lose him?

840
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,392
No. My Harmony is perfect.

841
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,656
Forky, it's tea time.
It's tea time.

842
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,717
- Whoo-hoo! What is tea time?
- Oh, I'll show you.

843
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,155
A little bit of milk,
two lumps of sugar.

844
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,276
I've been practicing.
How do I look?

845
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,955
Uh... A little higher.

846
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,994
Stick out your pinky.

847
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
Nice!

848
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,348
Mmm! Delicious!

849
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,280
Harmony, sweetie, I'm leaving.

850
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,588
Come give me a hug.

851
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,671
Bye, Mom.
I love you.

852
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,031
When my voice box is fixed...

853
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,994
I'll finally get my chance.

854
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,869
Now, about our friend Woody.

855
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,514
I wanna know
everything about him.

856
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Oh, yeah, Woody.

857
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,791
I've known that guy
my whole life. Two days!

858
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,230
Hey, did you know that
Bonnie was not his first kid?

859
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,311
He had this other kid, Andy.

860
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
And you know what?

861
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,040
I don't think
he's ever gotten over him.

862
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,312
Psst. Hey, Lightyear.

863
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,079
Hey, up here,
Astro-boy.

864
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,832
If you think you can
just show up

865
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,717
and take our top prize spot...

866
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,000
- you're wrong!
- Dead wrong!

867
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,712
You don't understand.
I'm trying to...

868
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,880
Cheat the system and get
with a kid? Yeah, we know.

869
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,319
No, I need...

870
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,311
A child to shower you
with unconditional love?

871
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,516
- Join the club, pal.
- Yeah, join the club!

872
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,159
Come on,
help me get outta here.

873
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,072
I'll help you. With my foot!

874
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,639
Get him.

875
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,392
Get him.

876
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,696
- Bunny, what are you doing?
- Hmm?

877
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,075
I can't reach him.
Help me out here, come on.

878
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,176
Oh, sorry, Ducky. I'm not
a mind reader, you know.

879
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,952
What's not to understand, hmm?

880
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,120
You gonna make me say it?

881
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,872
What?

882
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,394
With these tiny legs, I cannot
reach without your help.

883
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,629
Uh-huh. Okay?
This is what

884
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,920
I've been talking about,
Bunny.

885
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,176
You need to work
on paying attention

886
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,296
and your listening skills.

887
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,435
Ha!

888
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,192
How you like that, cheater?
Huh?

889
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,749
Yeah!

890
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,071
Oh, to infinity and my foot!
Boom!

891
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,669
In a galaxy far, far away,
you got kicked in the head!

892
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
Boom!

893
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,273
How do I get out of here?

894
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,834
This planet is toxic.

895
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,672
Closing helmet
to conserve oxygen.

896
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,816
In the vacuum of space,
they cannot hear you scream!

897
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,114
Ow!

898
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,200
Let go of me!

899
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,554
Get off of me!

900
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,936
Ooh! So, that's what
gravity feel like.

901
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,960
Yeah, that's it.

902
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,040
Hey, where you going?

903
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,056
You better get
over here, spaceman!

904
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,798
Yeah, put us
back up there!

905
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,656
Bunny, what are you doing?
He's getting away, let's go!

906
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,680
- I'm trying!
- Come on!

907
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,191
Antique store, here we come!

908
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,112
Bo, why do you ride around
in a skunk?

909
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,077
Whoa! Skunk!

910
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,389
A skunk!

911
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,152
Oh, I get it. Smart.

912
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,839
Corndogs, corndogs, corndogs!

913
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,560
Why are you so bad at driving?

914
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,517
You got six eyes.

915
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,472
Thanks for the landing.

916
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,120
- Uh...
- Come on, follow me.

917
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,976
- I'm fine.
- His face!

918
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,416
- That's hilarious.
- I'm fine. Don't worry.

919
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,919
Happens all the time.

920
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,080
Tape!

921
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,515
Not a bad hiding spot.

922
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,914
Yeah.
Leave the skunk.

923
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,520
- We'll fix it later.
- 10-4.

924
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,232
This will be more fun.

925
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,753
Let's get you to that store!

926
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,310
Okay, spill it.
The cowboy, what's the deal?

927
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,839
- There's no deal.
- Uh-huh.

928
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,070
Don't do this to yourself.
Cowboy's got a kid.

929
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,310
- Giggle...
- Trust me. I've been there.

930
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,596
You know about me and He-Man.
I'm not proud.

931
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,033
Shh! Here he comes!

932
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,718
- Oh, man...
- What?

933
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,153
No, not you.

934
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,117
Second Chance Antiques,
straight ahead.

935
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,656
Heavy foot traffic
at the entrance.

936
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,193
Easiest way in is

937
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,480
- the roof.
- The roof!

938
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,231
Let's go antiquing.

939
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,120
Hold on!

940
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,795
Huh?

941
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,675
Whoa!

942
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,988
How did you end up here?

943
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,736
I thought you were given
to a new family.

944
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,909
Oh, you know how it goes.

945
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,195
Their little girl grew up

946
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,953
and didn't need me anymore,
so...

947
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,473
Oh, I'm sorry, Bo.

948
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,471
Eh, who needs a kid's room...

949
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,633
when you can have all of this?

950
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,513
Whatcha looking at, Sheriff?

951
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,954
What? Oh, uh...

952
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,271
That wasn't...
No, uh, nothing.

953
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,798
I was looking at the store.
Right there.

954
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,552
I was looking
at the antique store.

955
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,591
- Giggle, count us down.
- Five.

956
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,840
- Countdown for what?
- Four.

957
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,176
You want to get to the store,
don't you?

958
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,200
Three. Two. One!

959
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,751
The highway exit
has to be somewhere.

960
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,273
Where is it?

961
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,476
Meteor shower! Look out!

962
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
Woody?

963
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,993
Good work, inner voice.

964
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,511
So, how about you?
How's your new kid?

965
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,069
Bonnie?
Oh, she's great.

966
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,275
Jessie is loving it.

967
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,440
Jessie's still with you?

968
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,636
Oh, yeah, the whole gang's
still together.

969
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,313
Well, I mean, most of us.

970
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,720
What about Rex?

971
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,911
Yeah, yeah, Rex,
Bullseye, Slinky...

972
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,752
- the Potato Heads...
- Buzz?

973
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,989
Yeah, Buzz, too.

974
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,958
I cannot wait to see his face
when he hears that I found...

975
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,872
- Bo Peep?
- Buzz!

976
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,678
- My old moving buddy!
- Buzz?

977
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,829
It's so good to see you!

978
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,035
Woody, it's Bo Peep!

979
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,280
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

980
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,776
Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...

981
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,856
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

982
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,199
- Three years!
- Three years!

983
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,360
That's how long we've been

984
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,656
hanging up there
waiting for a kid!

985
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,760
Look, I'm sorry about that.

986
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,797
You ruined our lives.
Shame on you!

987
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,552
Who are these guys?

988
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,520
- Lightyear promised us a kid.
- You did what?

989
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,976
I did not.

990
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,616
- Hey! Wait a minute!
- Eat my plush!

991
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,776
All right now,
come on, stop it!

992
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,800
Cut it out now!

993
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,080
Come on, guys, break it up.

994
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,160
Guys, I have a kid!

995
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,430
You got a kid?

996
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
Like a kid-kid?

997
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,916
Like a human kid,
not a baby goat?

998
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,036
Yeah. Now let go of Buzz
and come with me.

999
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,269
I'll take you to Bonnie.

1000
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,839
- We're gettin' a kid?
- Yes!

1001
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,096
We're gettin' a kid?

1002
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,951
- We're gonna get a kid
- Kid

1003
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,576
- We're getting a kid
- All right, let's go.

1004
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,096
- We gonna get something, oh
- We gonna uh, uh, uh

1005
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,270
- Where's Forky?
- Long story.

1006
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,914
- Kid, we get a kid
- Kid, kid, kid

1007
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,550
- We gonna kid
- We gonna kid, kid

1008
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,874
He's not anywhere.

1009
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,511
Forky's gone.

1010
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,193
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

1011
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,749
Okay. Let's look outside
one more time.

1012
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,559
But then we have to keep
driving, okay?

1013
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,199
They're about to leave!

1014
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,856
- Leaving?
- They can't do that!

1015
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,836
The panic is attacking me!

1016
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,911
- Hey! Watch it, buddy!
- What do we do?

1017
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,399
- We have to stop them!
- How?

1018
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,040
We could frame Dad for
a crime so he goes to jail.

1019
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,589
Or go back in time and warn
Woody about the future.

1020
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,896
That's crazy.
Time is a flat circle.

1021
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,920
Jessie!

1022
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,233
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

1023
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,360
We looked everywhere.

1024
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,736
But we need
to get going now, okay?

1025
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,176
Can we please leave a note
for Forky...

1026
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,679
so he knows where we're going?

1027
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,956
He has to go to kindergarten.

1028
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,509
Huh?

1029
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,991
Are you kidding me?
I can't...

1030
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,678
Everything is going perfect...
I just bought it.

1031
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,776
Okay! Daddy's
going to use some words.

1032
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,279
How about we go
to the carnival?

1033
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,079
Or maybe check out
some of those shops in town?

1034
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,473
What did you do?

1035
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,837
We're not going anywhere.
If you get my point.

1036
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,056
- Brilliant!
- That was genius!

1037
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,080
Nice work, Jessie!

1038
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,080
I'm sure Buzz and Woody are on
their way back right now.

1039
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,475
Whoa!

1040
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,240
Forky is in there?

1041
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,320
Yeah.

1042
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,496
Now, hold on.
I have a question.

1043
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,034
Who will Bonnie love more?
Ducky or me? Say me.

1044
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,720
- No, say Ducky. Ducky.
- Bunny. Bunny.

1045
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,960
Okay, guys.
Playtime is over.

1046
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,353
You have to follow my lead.

1047
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,034
We stay together,
we stay quiet. Are we clear?

1048
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,798
Absolutely.
Lead the way.

1049
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,960
- Are you kidding me?
- Move over.

1050
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,176
- You move over.
- Quit pushing me.

1051
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,474
- Stop.
- Shh!

1052
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,630
Oh, my maker!
That sheep has three heads!

1053
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,720
No, no, no!

1054
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,189
What? All six eyes
just looked into my soul.

1055
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,628
Gonna have nightmares.

1056
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,028
That's most likely where
your Forky is being kept.

1057
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,296
All right,
this isn't so bad.

1058
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,276
We just can't be seen
by the dummies.

1059
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,714
Not just the dummies.

1060
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,316
Her cabinet is surrounded
by a moat of exposed aisle.

1061
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,675
Where Dragon roams.

1062
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,149
- We can handle a cat.
- No.

1063
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,548
Not this one.

1064
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,873
Is that how we look
on the inside?

1065
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,270
- There's so much...
- fluff.

1066
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,816
So, how do you propose
we get up there?

1067
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,558
We could go straight across.

1068
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,392
- How?
- That's quite a jump.

1069
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,437
We know the perfect toy
to help.

1070
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,896
Oh, Bonnie, check it out.

1071
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,760
- Look at all this cool stuff.
- Bonnie?

1072
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,433
We gotta get
Forky now!

1073
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,794
Woody, don't...

1074
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,359
- Stick to the plan.
- 10-4.

1075
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,158
- Follow me.
- Roger that.

1076
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,874
Woody just sits in the closet?
With no playtime?

1077
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,275
Yeah, he told me himself,
he's useless.

1078
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,509
That's awful.

1079
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,999
Such pretty hair...

1080
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,715
What are you doing?

1081
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,120
You need to stick to the plan.

1082
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,593
But it's Bonnie.
She's right...

1083
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,320
Can we go
to the carnival, too?

1084
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,440
...there.

1085
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,511
Come on. Stay quiet.

1086
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,233
You better hope
the dummies didn't...

1087
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,108
Whoa!

1088
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,073
My sheep!

1089
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,390
What did I say?
I lead. You follow.

1090
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,233
Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.
Just tell me how to help.

1091
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,509
You really wanna help?

1092
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,114
Then stay out of my way.
I'm getting my sheep back.

1093
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,360
What about the others?

1094
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,953
Giggle knows what to do.

1095
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,160
- Here you go.
- That's our objective.

1096
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,117
We have to get that key.

1097
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,696
It's the only way
inside the cabinet.

1098
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,073
You can't be serious.

1099
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,360
How are we supposed
to do that?

1100
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,748
Okay.

1101
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,200
You know what,
leave that to us.

1102
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,316
- We know exactly what to do.
- Mmm-hmm.

1103
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,395
Aw.

1104
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,311
Where did you two come from?

1105
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,710
The keys! Give 'em
up now! Where are they?

1106
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,240
Give us the keys!
Give us the keys!

1107
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,000
Well, we're not doing that.

1108
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,296
Yeah, yeah, I agree,
too visible.

1109
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,696
It's a good point.
Something more subtle.

1110
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,216
Ooh, what about "Winner,
winner, chicken dinner"?

1111
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,240
Yes.

1112
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,875
The keys! Give 'em
up now! Where are they?

1113
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,992
- Uh... you're kidding.
- Really?

1114
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,713
Okay, okay. You just...

1115
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,108
All right. Well...

1116
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,156
Oh, what about the old
"Plush Rush"?

1117
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,355
There you go!

1118
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,000
- Argh. Where is this going?
- Shh! Don't interrupt.

1119
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,120
- Okay, right?
- Uh-huh?

1120
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,310
Not gonna happen.
N-O.

1121
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,152
Okay, do you want
the key or not?

1122
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,480
What is wrong with you?

1123
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,520
What is wrong with...?

1124
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,636
We just gave you
three brilliant ideas.

1125
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,073
It's one thing
to say no.

1126
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,718
It's another to offer
a reason...

1127
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,319
How do we get that key?

1128
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,153
You're kidding!

1129
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,389
Really?

1130
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,788
Woody's back?

1131
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,995
Woody's back?

1132
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,957
And you're sure it's Bo Peep
who's with him?

1133
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,440
Thank you, Benson.

1134
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,840
Make sure the others
are ready.

1135
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,909
Woody's back!

1136
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,071
I'm coming, Bonnie!

1137
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,040
Bonnie.

1138
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,156
First, we must prepare
for his arrival.

1139
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,395
Prepare?

1140
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,736
Have you ever played
hide-and-seek?

1141
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,876
No. But it sounds complicated.

1142
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,040
Oh, it's easy.

1143
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,673
- I'll teach you, okay?
- Okay.

1144
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,273
The first thing you do is...

1145
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,511
one of us finds a place
to hide...

1146
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,600
Scary.

1147
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,136
...while
the other one counts to ten...

1148
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,752
then tries to find them.

1149
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,233
- What are we doing?
- Shh!

1150
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,159
Just stand there and be quiet!

1151
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,037
I'll do the talking.

1152
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,072
Hi, Tinny!

1153
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,832
Aw, nice to see you, too.

1154
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,917
Yeah, he's with me.

1155
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,599
My friend? No, no, no.

1156
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,512
He's my accessory.

1157
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,478
- Hey, guys.
- Bo!

1158
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,710
Long time no see.

1159
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,273
Couldn't take it
out there, huh?

1160
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,588
Hey, Doug.
Saw your better half

1161
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,789
at the front of the store.

1162
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,314
Yeah, you mess with the cat,
you get the claws.

1163
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,400
Bo came back!

1164
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,680
Magic 8-Ball was right!

1165
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,796
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- What are you doing here?

1166
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,836
I thought the store
had no return policy!

1167
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,115
Bo, help me out.

1168
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,536
I need a battery.

1169
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,279
We got to get
this wagon train a-movin'!

1170
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,856
- Agreed.
- Help, help, help.

1171
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,880
Cheater.

1172
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,155
Have you seen Duke?

1173
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,634
He's in the back.

1174
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,757
Look who jumped
40 school buses

1175
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,068
and landed back into my life.

1176
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,356
- Hi, Duke!
- Who's the cowboy?

1177
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,237
Duke, meet Woody.
Woody, meet...

1178
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,437
Duke Caboom.
Canada's greatest stuntman.

1179
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,112
Oh, yeah!

1180
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,395
- Yes!
- Huh?

1181
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,993
He's posing.

1182
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,675
Duke?

1183
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,831
- Duke, we need to...
- Hold on. One more.

1184
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,150
Oh, yeah!
What brings you back, Peep?

1185
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,355
We need your help.

1186
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,711
Gabby Gabby has his toy
and my sheep.

1187
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,917
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?
Those are my girls.

1188
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,113
What were you doing
getting tangled up

1189
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,593
with Gabby Gabby?
You know better.

1190
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,069
Yeah, some toy thought
it would be a good idea...

1191
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,280
to wander into the aisle.

1192
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,834
That doesn't make any sense.

1193
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,194
It doesn't, does it?

1194
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,589
Everybody knows the best route
is behind the shelves.

1195
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,990
That would have been
a better route, wouldn't it?

1196
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,991
Wow, this toy sounds like
a complete idiot.

1197
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,672
He does!

1198
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,557
Wait, are you that toy?

1199
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,473
So, here's the plan.

1200
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,200
We need to jump over the aisle
to Gabby's cabinet.

1201
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,079
- And you are the toy to do it.
- No.

1202
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,309
- Duke.
- Nope.

1203
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,799
- Duke? Duke?
- Nuh-uh. No way!

1204
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,279
- Duke. Duke!
- Pass. Negative.

1205
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,475
- Duke.
- Rejected.

1206
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,516
Oh, please, Mr. Caboom,
this is really important.

1207
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,635
My kid...

1208
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,800
You have a kid?

1209
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,552
Uh...

1210
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,029
Hey, Duke, show us some more
poses, what do you say?

1211
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,111
- I had a kid.
- Oh, no.

1212
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,919
Rejean.

1213
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,550
Rejean was so excited when
he got me after Christmas.

1214
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,071
It was the happiest Boxing Day
of my life.

1215
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,200
That's Duke Caboom,

1216
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,510
riding the amazing
Caboom stunt cycle!

1217
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,113
Caboom!

1218
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,837
I was ready to finally
do what I was made to do.

1219
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,433
Caboom!

1220
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,431
But when Rejean realized
I couldn't jump

1221
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,112
as far as the toy
in the commercial...

1222
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,313
It's a commercial!
It's not real!

1223
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,913
Rejean threw me away!

1224
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,195
It's not fair!

1225
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,237
Why, Rejean? Why?

1226
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,071
Okay, okay.
Calm down, Duke.

1227
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,798
That was a long time ago.

1228
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,152
Right now,
we need the only toy

1229
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,669
who can crash us
onto Gabby's cabinet.

1230
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,830
Crash?

1231
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,956
Any Duke Caboom toy
can land...

1232
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,948
but you are the only one
that can crash the way you do.

1233
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,439
- I am?
- Yes!

1234
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,029
Forget Rejean.
Forget your commercial.

1235
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,395
Be the Duke
you are right now...

1236
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,597
the one who jumps and crashes!

1237
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,676
Be who I am right now.

1238
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,756
Who's the Canuck
with all the luck?

1239
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,600
Caboom?

1240
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,557
Who's the greatest
of the Great White North?

1241
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,640
Caboom!

1242
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,438
Who's the most spectacular
daredevil

1243
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,669
Canada has ever seen?

1244
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,473
Duke Caboom!

1245
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,909
Can you do the jump?

1246
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,116
Yes, I Canada!

1247
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,838
Uh-huh.

1248
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,911
- We've got our ride.
- Yes!

1249
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,833
Yee-haw!

1250
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,589
Yo, Bo!

1251
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,591
Gigs! You made it!

1252
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,029
Good work!

1253
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,349
How'd you get it?

1254
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,796
How do we get that key?

1255
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,713
- It was hard.
- Very difficult.

1256
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,313
- Barely made it out alive.
- Yeah.

1257
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,549
So, you're welcome.

1258
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,711
Okay. Let's do this.

1259
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,471
Let me wrap that up for you.

1260
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,074
Don't want anything to happen
to it on the way home.

1261
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,435
Good. That sale buys us
some time.

1262
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,709
Wait for it.

1263
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,752
All right, let's go!

1264
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,510
So, how long were you in here?

1265
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,079
I don't know.
Couple years.

1266
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,392
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf
waiting for my life to happen.

1267
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,560
So, I left.

1268
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,915
Wow.

1269
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,310
You've handled this lost toy
life better than I could.

1270
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,153
Aw, Sheriff.

1271
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,192
You're selling yourself short.

1272
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,435
I think you'd make
a great lost toy.

1273
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,035
You really don't think

1274
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,917
you'll ever be in a kid's room
again, huh?

1275
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,080
Nope.

1276
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,776
And now with the carnival
traveling through,

1277
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,976
it's our chance
to hop a ride...

1278
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,991
- and leave town.
- You're leaving?

1279
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,160
Sure am.

1280
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,560
You ever think about getting
out there, seeing the world?

1281
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,238
Without a kid?

1282
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,238
No. You can't teach
this old toy new tricks.

1283
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,311
You'd be surprised.

1284
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,712
So, how'd you end up in
this store in the first place?

1285
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,189
Well, I saw your lamp
in the window...

1286
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,796
and I thought maybe
you were inside...

1287
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,956
and so I, uh...

1288
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,029
Wow.

1289
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,268
Yeah.

1290
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,720
Will you look at that?

1291
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,992
This is the only part
of the store I ever liked.

1292
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,912
That's gonna be quite a jump
for you and Duke.

1293
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,435
For me?

1294
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,416
Didn't I tell you?
You're going with him.

1295
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,440
I am?

1296
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,829
Let's caboom.

1297
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,399
It'll be fine,
Duke's the best.

1298
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,073
Yeah, at crashing.

1299
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,389
And now!

1300
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,755
Go!

1301
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,840
Whoa!

1302
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,237
Huh? Rejean.

1303
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,954
It's a commercial.
It's not real!

1304
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,190
I can't do this!
I'm sorry, Rejean!

1305
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,993
No, no, no!

1306
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,677
What's new, pussycat?

1307
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,873
- Forky?
- Girls?

1308
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,720
Forky, where are you?

1309
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,472
You're never
gonna find me.

1310
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,680
Forky?

1311
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,910
Woody!
How'd you find me?

1312
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,877
- Bo, I found him!
- Hi.

1313
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,634
Wait, it's an actual fork?

1314
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,308
Bo! Bo! Bo!

1315
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,033
Buzz!
The dummies are gone!

1316
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,077
What?
Where'd they go?

1317
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,360
Okay, we can go now!

1318
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,760
- No. I need to find my girls.
- Hello, Woody.

1319
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:49,920
Hi, Bo.

1320
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,433
- Where are my sheep?
- Yeah!

1321
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,794
Look! Woody found me!

1322
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,031
Take the bunny!
I'm too cute to die!

1323
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,839
Hi-ya!
- Oh, no, no!

1324
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,439
Woody!

1325
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,353
- I just wanna talk.
- Yeah, with my voice box!

1326
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,789
Pull!

1327
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,268
Whoa!

1328
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,149
You're my favorite deputy.

1329
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,471
Somebody's poisoned
the water hole.

1330
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,136
I'd like to join your posse.

1331
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,276
Reach for the sky!

1332
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,193
Girls!

1333
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,634
Drop it.

1334
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,032
No! No!
Forky!

1335
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,269
- We've gotta go!
- Wait!

1336
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,593
Forky!

1337
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,280
Woody!

1338
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,835
Bonnie's backpack?

1339
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,155
Ahh!

1340
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,399
Giggle!

1341
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,799
Don't let Woody leave!

1342
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,720
Grab on!

1343
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,879
Duke, get us out of here!

1344
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,080
Oui!

1345
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,758
Here, kitty, kitty!

1346
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,598
Wait! We don't have Forky!

1347
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,079
Woody!

1348
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,035
Forky!

1349
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,794
Is everyone okay?

1350
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,470
Shh. It's okay.

1351
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,193
Shh. It's okay.

1352
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,637
Bunny? Bunny?

1353
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,351
Bunny!
No, no, no, no.

1354
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,080
No, no, no, no.

1355
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,556
- Oh, Bunny!
- It's gonna be okay.

1356
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,675
Forky's still in there.

1357
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,376
If we hurry, we can get him
before they lock him up.

1358
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,719
You want us
to go back in there?

1359
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,994
We barely got out alive.

1360
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,388
Woody, it's better if we wait.

1361
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,016
No, no, no. There's no time.
We can easily get back inside.

1362
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,040
But I saw Bonnie's...

1363
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,216
By my count, there were
only four dummies.

1364
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,240
But the backpack...

1365
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,456
We outnumber them.
So we have the advantage.

1366
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,799
Woody, look at us!

1367
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,917
Nobody is with you.
It's over, okay?

1368
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,275
No. No, no, no. We are
wasting time. We can do this.

1369
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,336
- Come on, Pull-string.
- It's not worth it.

1370
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,395
Yeah, yes, listen to her!

1371
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,312
- Nobody wants this!
- I do!

1372
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,515
- Why?
- Because!

1373
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,432
- Why?
- Just because!

1374
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,520
Why?

1375
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,960
Because it's all
I have left to do!

1376
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,398
I don't have anything else.

1377
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,438
So, the rest of us
don't count?

1378
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,477
That's not what I meant.

1379
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,033
Bonnie needs Forky.

1380
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,634
No. You need Bonnie!

1381
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,028
Open your eyes, Woody.

1382
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,031
There's plenty of kids
out there.

1383
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,239
It can't be just about the one
you're still clinging to.

1384
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,237
It's called loyalty.

1385
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,271
Something a lost toy
wouldn't understand.

1386
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,316
I'm not the one who's lost.

1387
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,074
Let's get out of here.

1388
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,708
We've got a carnival
that leaves in the morning.

1389
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,194
Come on.

1390
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,628
Mmm-hmm.

1391
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,994
We'll find our own kid.

1392
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,513
You're crazy.

1393
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,235
Bo!

1394
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,677
Bye, Woody.
Good luck with Bonnie.

1395
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,830
Woody, you did all you could.

1396
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,672
Time to go home.

1397
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,909
No.

1398
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Woody.

1399
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,479
I don't leave toys behind,
Buzz.

1400
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,936
Yeah, but, Woody,
you're actually leaving...

1401
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,791
Not now. Not ever.

1402
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,431
And he left me behind.

1403
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,038
What now, inner voice?

1404
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,080
Mission
accomplished. Return to base.

1405
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,315
Go back to the RV?
What about Woody?

1406
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,198
We're going home,
space ranger.

1407
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,554
Fall back, this planet...

1408
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,789
Retreat! There's too...

1409
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,791
Go! Time to fly! Exit the...
Back... Run...

1410
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,598
Get out!
Returning to Star Command.

1411
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,030
Okay. Okay.

1412
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,477
Thanks a lot, inner voice.

1413
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:29,190
Harmony, honey, help Grandma
close up for the night.

1414
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,113
Okay. Then can we
go to the carnival?

1415
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,280
Sure.

1416
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,038
- Ahhh!
- Hello, Woody.

1417
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,755
I knew you'd be back.

1418
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,474
You don't know me.

1419
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,193
But I do.

1420
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,752
You were left in the closet,
feeling useless...

1421
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,391
wondering if you'll
ever get played with.

1422
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,357
I'm not leaving without Forky.

1423
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,551
Can we agree
on just one thing?

1424
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,469
What?

1425
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,278
That being there for a child

1426
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:04,670
is the most noble thing
a toy can do.

1427
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,235
Okay.

1428
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,115
I was defective
right out of the box.

1429
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,078
I can only imagine what it
must have been like for you.

1430
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,672
All that time you spent
with Andy...

1431
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,636
riding a bike with him
for the first time...

1432
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,472
comforting him
when he skinned his knee...

1433
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,876
proudly watching him grow up.

1434
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,278
And then you got
a second chance with Bonnie...

1435
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,159
giving her comfort
when she's scared at school...

1436
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,914
helping her
when she needs it most.

1437
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,629
You've been there through
all their ups and downs.

1438
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,079
Please.

1439
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,434
Be honest with me.

1440
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,114
Was it as wonderful
as it sounds?

1441
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,433
It was.

1442
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,993
All I want is a chance
for just one of those moments.

1443
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,229
I'd give anything to be loved
the way you have.

1444
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,679
Just leave me Forky.

1445
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,072
Bonnie needs him.

1446
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,312
Of course.

1447
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,193
The flat tire is fixed!

1448
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,231
Come on, Woody, hurry up.

1449
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,675
Where is he?

1450
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,512
- Buzz!
- Buzz!

1451
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,136
- Where's Woody?
- And Forky?

1452
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,229
We have a situation.

1453
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,136
They need to be extracted
from the antique store.

1454
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,520
How do we do that?

1455
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,296
Okay, let's
make sure we have everything.

1456
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,992
Finally.

1457
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,513
It's okay.
Any minute now...

1458
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,035
Bonnie will notice
her backpack is missing.

1459
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,136
She'll realize she left it
at the antique store...

1460
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,479
and we'll head back in there.

1461
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,656
Okay.
Looks like we have everything.

1462
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,079
- You good, Bonnie?
- Yup.

1463
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,736
Great. Let's get out of here.

1464
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,711
Okay, genius,
what do we do now?

1465
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,800
Hmm.

1466
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,936
Scanning perimeter.

1467
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:16,960
Laser at full power!

1468
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,156
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- I'm thinking.

1469
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,016
Honey, will you
please shut that toy off?

1470
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,040
Yeah, I got it.

1471
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,031
Attack!
Meteor shower! Look out!

1472
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,936
It's a secret mission in
uncharted space! Let's go!

1473
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,235
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1474
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,576
Bonnie,
how do you turn this off?

1475
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,720
Full speed ahead!

1476
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,576
- Open the pod bay doors!
- I don't know.

1477
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,158
It's just you and me now,
cadet.

1478
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,576
A distress signal is coming
from that rocket.

1479
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,216
Just toss it in the drawer.

1480
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,277
To infinity and beyond!

1481
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,720
Uh-oh. Uh, your backpack's in
the antique store! Let's go!

1482
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,115
Oh, no, my backpack!

1483
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,390
I left my backpack
in the antique store!

1484
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,833
You did?

1485
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,912
All right,
let's swing by and get it.

1486
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,798
Ugh! I can't believe
the nerve of that cowboy.

1487
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,199
I mean,
who does he think he is?

1488
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,599
Exactly!

1489
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,352
He was way out of line.

1490
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,200
You did the right thing
leaving him behind.

1491
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,073
- Hey, Lamb Chops?
- Hmm.

1492
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,872
- Coast is clear.
- Oh.

1493
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,360
Head to the middle.

1494
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,953
When the carnival
leaves tomorrow,

1495
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,268
we'll hide right there.

1496
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,594
- Uh, no way!
- Stuff that.

1497
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,680
Awesome.

1498
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,074
Stick with me.
You'll be fine.

1499
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,296
- Ready?
- No!

1500
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,320
And another thing,

1501
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,976
- Woody asked you for help.
- On your mark...

1502
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,096
And he treats you like that?

1503
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,236
- ...get set...
- He only cares about himself.

1504
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,320
No!

1505
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,656
You're wrong.

1506
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,440
Woody's always trying to
do right by his kid.

1507
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,232
By putting everyone in danger.

1508
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,754
Ugh. That kind of crazy
loyalty just...

1509
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,148
You gotta love him for it.

1510
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,136
Whoa, say what now?

1511
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,639
Hey, hey, hey, Bo!
What's the plan?

1512
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,914
Fill me in here.

1513
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,336
Get in! We're going back.

1514
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,360
We just got here.

1515
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,272
You heard Bo!
We're going back!

1516
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,510
Move your plush! Let's ride!

1517
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,992
You're my favorite...

1518
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:24,914
Yay!

1519
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,078
You are my best friend.

1520
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,593
Let's play all day!

1521
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,318
Oh, Benson!
Did you hear that?

1522
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,708
Isn't that lovely?

1523
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,949
Time for tea.

1524
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,832
Oh, thank you, Woody.
Thank you!

1525
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,599
All my dreams

1526
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,880
are coming true
because of you.

1527
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,035
Thank you! Thank you!

1528
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,120
Uh, you're welcome.

1529
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:44,316
It's time, Benson.

1530
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,588
Goodbye, Forky.
I'm going to miss our talks.

1531
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,155
Me, too.
Good luck, Gabby.

1532
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,117
Thank you, my little utensil.

1533
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,239
Bye, Gabby!
Goodbye, Benson!

1534
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,310
He is terrifying.

1535
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,959
- Hello.
- Hi.

1536
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,189
Bonnie?

1537
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,536
Can I help you with anything?

1538
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,816
Yeah. We called
about the backpack.

1539
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,637
Oh, yes.
I couldn't find it.

1540
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,496
Feel free to look around.

1541
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,750
Quick! Before she finds it!

1542
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,311
Look! There's Harmony.

1543
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,072
You make me so happy!

1544
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,275
Let's be best friends.

1545
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,639
Oh, this is it!

1546
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,558
We're going home, Forky!

1547
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,280
Huh?

1548
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,197
Forky! Oh!

1549
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,429
No, no, no. Woody, look!
It's really happening!

1550
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,274
I'm Gabby Gabby,
and I love you.

1551
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,672
I'm gonna cry.

1552
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,114
Oh, what have you got there?

1553
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,992
I found this old doll.

1554
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,150
You can take it home
if you want.

1555
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,989
Nah.

1556
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,189
What happened? Gabby was
supposed to be her toy.

1557
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,056
There's my backpack!

1558
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,149
Mom, it's over here.

1559
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,509
Forky!

1560
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,119
Mom, I found him!

1561
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,713
Oh, there he is!

1562
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,679
Now, please leave him
in there,

1563
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,920
so he doesn't get lost again.

1564
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,634
But what about Gabby?

1565
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,918
Forky, listen to me
very carefully.

1566
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,718
This is important.

1567
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,836
Tell Buzz to get the RV
to the merry-go-round.

1568
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,035
You understand?

1569
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,236
Absolutely.
What is a merry-go-round?

1570
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,959
The spinny ride
with lights and horses.

1571
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,400
- Oh. You mean a carousel.
- Yes!

1572
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,718
Carousel. Yes!
Meet me at the carousel.

1573
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,840
Got it.

1574
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,629
Gabby! Hey, Gabby!

1575
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,595
You can have
your voice box back.

1576
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,118
I don't need it anymore.

1577
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,355
Oh, yes, you do.

1578
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,272
Harmony wasn't
your only chance, Gabby,

1579
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,560
but we have to hurry. Come on.

1580
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,871
No. Harmony was my chance.

1581
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,910
My time's over.

1582
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,996
Now, please go away.

1583
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,193
You hear that?

1584
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,677
A friend once told me...

1585
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,229
"There are plenty of kids
out there."

1586
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,908
And one of them
is named Bonnie.

1587
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,194
She's waiting for you,
right now.

1588
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,431
She just doesn't know it yet.

1589
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,315
What if you're wrong?

1590
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,096
Well, if you sit on a shelf
the rest of your life...

1591
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,076
you'll never find out,
will you?

1592
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,028
He's right.

1593
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,751
I learned that from the best.

1594
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,150
Come on, Gabby.

1595
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,958
Let's get you to Bonnie.

1596
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,720
The carousel?

1597
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,394
Yeah, it's the spinny ride
with lights and horses.

1598
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,198
Woody said to meet him there.

1599
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,191
- You gotta be kidding!
- How do we do that?

1600
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,474
Oh! We could, uh...

1601
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:46,834
We are not
sending Dad to jail.

1602
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,069
You're no fun.

1603
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,800
Left turn in 0.5 miles.

1604
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,594
Wait a second. I have an idea.

1605
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:05,920
Skunk!

1606
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Skunk!

1607
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,956
Too many people.
Gonna need an alternate route.

1608
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,111
Will we make it
to the carousel in time?

1609
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,196
Yes, we Canada!

1610
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,509
What? What is it?

1611
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,997
Recalculating.
Take a right.

1612
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,229
What? A right?

1613
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,118
Right turn ahead.

1614
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,096
Huh. Does
the GPS sound funny to you?

1615
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,800
Honey, it's fine. Just drive.

1616
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,640
Hmm,
I thought it sounded funny.

1617
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,720
Another right!

1618
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,916
- Right.
- Take another right.

1619
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,513
- Huh?
- Another right? Really?

1620
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:56,715
- Turn right!
- Now!

1621
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,153
Turn right!

1622
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,096
- We're headin' back.
- There's the carousel!

1623
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,588
Do you think
Woody will get there in time?

1624
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,514
Nope. Forget it. Never.
No. No way. Declined.

1625
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,560
- No dice. Rejected.
- Duke, Duke, you got this.

1626
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,392
This is the fastest way
to the carousel.

1627
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,675
You made the last jump.

1628
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,831
Yeah, but that was 4 feet.
This is 40!

1629
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,271
Exactly! Duke Caboom
would never repeat a stunt.

1630
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,237
- No. He'd never do that.
- No, no, no.

1631
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,356
He's the toy
that went on to crash

1632
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,432
40 feet into that target!

1633
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,556
Yeah, he is.

1634
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,239
I'm Duke Caboom!

1635
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,118
Oh, man. I can do this!

1636
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,474
Yes, you Canada!

1637
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,896
I can do it
with my eyes closed.

1638
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:34,920
Yes, you... What?

1639
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,840
- Three, two, one. Go!
- What? No, wait!

1640
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,272
- What is he doing?
- Oh, no.

1641
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,235
This is for you, Rejean.

1642
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,034
Caboom.

1643
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,280
Yes!

1644
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,760
He did it!

1645
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,920
All right, our turn!

1646
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,991
You heard the sheriff.
Let's go.

1647
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,120
Yee-haw!

1648
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,233
Another right!

1649
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,032
Another right?
That's the wrong way.

1650
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,077
- Are you sure?
- Stupid rental.

1651
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,760
- I'm turning us around.
- No!

1652
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,256
- Huh?
- Recalculating.

1653
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,349
Turn right.

1654
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,829
- Must be broken.
- No! No!

1655
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,360
What is happening?

1656
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,616
Honey, what are you doing?
Slow down!

1657
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,640
I can't! I can't!

1658
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,480
- Press the brake. Press it!
- I'm trying.

1659
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,319
Got a visual
on the RV,

1660
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,436
heading southbound.

1661
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,800
Gabby?

1662
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,360
Gabby?

1663
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,719
I think she's lost.

1664
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,633
Are you sure?

1665
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,079
Change of plans.

1666
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,958
Pull over.

1667
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,476
I can't! This is a rental!

1668
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,993
I don't know what's happening!

1669
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,033
I'm so nervous.

1670
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,676
- What if she doesn't like me?
- Gabby.

1671
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,936
I don't know if I can do this.

1672
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,428
Gabby,
it's just like you said.

1673
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,952
This is the most noble thing
a toy can do.

1674
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,120
Okay.

1675
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,998
Just edge yourself
a bit into the light.

1676
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,473
Not too far.

1677
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,194
That's it.

1678
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,748
Perfect.

1679
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,997
- Winner, winner...
- Chicken dinner.

1680
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,351
Are you lost, too?

1681
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,475
I'm Gabby Gabby.
Will you be my friend?

1682
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,552
I'll help you.

1683
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,035
Excuse me, can you...
Can you help us?

1684
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,593
Oh, honey, what's wrong?

1685
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,478
I can't find my mom and dad.

1686
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,358
It's okay.
I'll help you find them.

1687
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,669
I'm sure they're not far.

1688
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,216
She was right next to us.

1689
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,673
She was right here!

1690
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,336
And I looked
away for one second.

1691
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,588
Mommy!

1692
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,908
I couldn't find you...

1693
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,274
and then I found this doll.

1694
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,440
You did?

1695
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,914
Her name is Gabby Gabby.

1696
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,788
Whoa. We actually did that.

1697
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,515
Oh, yeah. Yes!

1698
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,398
That was amazing.

1699
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,437
We make a great team, guys.

1700
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,834
Pull over now!

1701
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,238
Almost there.

1702
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,198
- Stop!
- Stop!

1703
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,593
Are we home?

1704
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,439
Huh?

1705
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,748
Sir, will you please
step out of the vehicle?

1706
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,434
Dad's totally going to jail.

1707
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,392
Everyone, topside.
Let's move.

1708
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,154
Forky, I've got a very
important job for you.

1709
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,959
For me?

1710
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,231
Have a good night.

1711
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,676
What the...?

1712
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,756
You've gotta be kidding me.

1713
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,400
Hey.

1714
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,149
Um... So long, cowboy.

1715
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,673
Happy trails.

1716
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,755
Billy, Goat, Gruff.
Take care of her, girls.

1717
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,795
I'm glad
I got to see you again.

1718
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,039
I... I don't...

1719
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,108
Goodbye, Bo.

1720
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,031
Buzz, I... I...

1721
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,593
She'll be okay.

1722
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,388
Bonnie will be okay.

1723
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,915
You sure?

1724
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,673
Hey.
Listen to your inner voice.

1725
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,120
Bo?

1726
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,320
Is it really her?

1727
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,799
I'll be danged,
it's Bo!

1728
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,593
Jessie.

1729
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,269
Bo!

1730
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,431
Oh!

1731
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,359
So long, Forky.

1732
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,040
Forky?
Who's watching the doors?

1733
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,279
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, boy.

1734
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,915
Oh, my goodness. The awning.
What is going on?

1735
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:19,356
Does this mean
Woody's a lost toy?

1736
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,675
He's not lost.

1737
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,917
Not anymore.

1738
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,078
To infinity...

1739
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,990
And beyond.

1740
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,148
Yay!

1741
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,075
There goes
another one.

1742
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,878
We're never
getting outta here.

1743
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,154
Psst. Frog legs.

1744
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:35,360
Up here, Rainbow Connection.

1745
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,034
You Mr. Toads wanna take
a wild ride with a kid?

1746
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,120
We can make that happen.

1747
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,679
- You can?
- Really?

1748
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,239
Oh, yeah!
Leave it to us, Jeremiah.

1749
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,039
Aw.

1750
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,079
All right. Nice job, gang!

1751
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,593
Every prize with a kid.

1752
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,113
- What's next?
- Leave that to us.

1753
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:32,120
- We know exactly what to do.
- Mmm-hmm.

1754
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,638
Plush Rush!

1755
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,312
How you like that, huh?

1756
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,198
You got plush-rushed, son!

1757
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,594
Dance!

1758
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,399
Dance! Get those knees up!

1759
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,229
Let's see those feet move!
Whoo!

1760
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,915
Or we can get more toys
to kids.

1761
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,752
Yeah, let's do that.

1762
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,075
Do you really have laser eyes?

1763
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,080
Yeah.

1764
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,549
Whoa.

1765
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,158
Hi, toys. Bye, toys.

1766
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,269
Jessie's back!

1767
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:22,271
What's first grade like?
Tell me everything!

1768
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,440
Well, it was...

1769
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,616
How was "Present and Explain"?

1770
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,296
Uh, you mean "Show and Tell"
there, big guy.

1771
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,594
You see any kids eat paste?

1772
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:28,680
Guys, listen!

1773
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,228
Bonnie had a great day
in first grade.

1774
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,635
She even made
a new friend in class.

1775
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,950
Oh, she's already
making friends.

1776
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,759
No, no, she made a new friend.

1777
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,634
Come on out, it's okay.

1778
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:03,396
Hi. I'm, uh... I'm Forky.

1779
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,551
Trash?

1780
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,718
No, no. Toy.
I am a...

1781
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,912
We are all toys.

1782
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,870
Unique, beautiful toys.

1783
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:18,836
I will explain everything.

1784
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:23,679
How am I alive?

1785
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,230
I don't know.

1786
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:47,798
I was a lonesome cowboy

1787
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:52,197
Lonesome as I could be

1788
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:57,039
You came along
and changed my life

1789
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,672
And fixed
what was broken in me

1790
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:06,955
I was a lonesome cowboy

1791
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,436
I didn't have a friend

1792
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:15,679
Now I got friends
coming out of my ears

1793
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,515
I'll never be lonesome again

1794
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:24,952
You can't be happy
when you're all by yourself

1795
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,350
Go on, tell me I'm wrong

1796
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:28,919
You're wrong

1797
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:33,234
When someone takes you
down from the shelf

1798
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,710
And plays with you some
It's wonderful

1799
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,108
Wonderful

1800
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:42,751
I was a lonesome cowboy

1801
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,669
But not anymore

1802
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,833
I just found out
What love is about

1803
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,276
I've never
felt this way before

1804
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:59,991
I was a lonesome cowboy

1805
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:06,710
But not anymore

1806
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:56,829
Caboom!

1807
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,320
Yes!

1807
01:40:00,305 --> 01:41:00,327
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
