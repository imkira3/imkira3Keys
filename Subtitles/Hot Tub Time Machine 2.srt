LOU: Whose fucking phone is on?

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,140
MAN: Uh, we're going
to just touch you up.

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,969
- Okay, Mr. Dorchen?
- Hey.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,180
Do I need nipple rouge?

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,660
MAN: Uh, can we get... I don't, uh...

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,524
Do I need any nipple rouge?

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,980
MAN: Yeah.
Touch up his nipples, please.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,060
(GIGGLES)

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,242
What kind of brush is that?
Is that rabbit fur?

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,300
NARRATOR: Lou Dorchen,
the legendary lead singer

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,323
of metal supergroup Motley Lue,

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,960
who burst onto the world stage
out of nowhere

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,540
to become the very definition
of a rock god.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,803
Livin' the dream with
high school sweetheart Kelly Dorchen.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,860
So how did the ultimate party
animal get the inspiration

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,180
to build the most innovative,
forward-thinking

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,020
tech company in the world?

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,220
I don't have to tell you where I got
my inspiration from, first of all.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,900
Because that's called
"intellectual property"

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,540
and I can copyright that shit.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,404
Just like I copyrighted the word "well,"

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,761
so you can't even say "well"
without paying me money.

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,540
- MAN: Uh, well, um...
- You owe me money.

American success story,
music mogul Nick Webber.

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,180
Ever since I wrote Let's Get It Started
back in '86,

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,327
I've been on a roll.

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,740
Uh, MMMBop, triple platinum.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,580
A lot of stations still playin'
Gin and Juicey Juice.

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,684
You Oughta Know.
Feelin' Like Teen Spirit.

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,649
I guess you could say
I take from a lot of artists.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,686
Take my inspiration
from a lot of artists.

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,881
I don't...

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,964
I don't take their stuff.

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,248
That's... Who would do that?

40
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,940
- Yeah. Ask me anything.
- MAN: Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,220
How's your relationship
with your father?

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,620
I don't want to talk about that.

NARRATOR: Still struggling to find
his own place in the world,

44
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,647
Jacob Dorchen comments on his
father's game-changing innovation.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,083
He didn't invent Goo... Lougle.

46
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,940
He couldn't invent his way
out of a fucking paper bag.

47
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,540
And that's...
That's not a turn of phrase,

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,300
that's anecdotal evidence.

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,085
He got caught in a giant paper
bag a couple weeks ago.

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,402
Adam... Adam Yates.
Yes, he rounds out

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,500
our Three Musketeerposse.

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,500
He made it real big
with his bestselling novel,

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,250
Jacuzzi Timelord.

54
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,565
But Adam, he's, uh...
He's off on an experiential journey.

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,923
I got a feeling we'll see him again.

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,300
I got a feeling.

(SINGING UPBEAT SONG)

NARRATOR:
One fateful ski trip in 1986

60
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,247
seemed to kick-start
their lives into high gear.

61
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,420
But what was it like to grow up
alongside these future stars?

62
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,727
We turned to high school pal,
Gary Winkle.

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,200
I bet you guys didn't know that I was
supposed to go on that trip, huh?

64
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,620
- I stood outside all day...
- (WHIMPERS)

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,724
...but they never showed.
Left me hanging.

66
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,540
You know what I got that weekend?

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,620
Chlamydia from the batting cages.

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,180
My best buddies go up
the mountain as regular Joes.

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,602
Come down fucking rich.
I mean, how did that happen?

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,420
I mean, at the end of the day,

71
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,340
I'm just a simple guy like you

72
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,568
who had a couple of great ideas

73
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,060
that happen to make him
a bunch of money. That's it.

74
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,527
I mean, how was I supposed to know

75
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,860
that it would change the fabric
of our existence? I couldn't.

76
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,681
You know, I couldn't,
unless I had some sort of...

80
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,610
One word, Nick. Fucking amazing...

84
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,380
For your information,
today I recorded an original piece.

85
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,460
Really?

86
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,050
Okay, it was that Lisa Loeb song.

87
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,764
Well, as much of it as I could remember.

88
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,405
The lyrics I made up were original.

89
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,540
Listen, Nick, I get it.
You don't have any natural talent.

90
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,460
All I know is that hot tub
made me a king.

91
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,300
It's my duty to live up to the throne.

92
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,580
All right, I can't see you right now,

93
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,365
but I'm gonna assume you're putting
"king" and "throne" in quotes.

94
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,300
What do you want?

95
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,020
Hey, Nick, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be a dick.

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,167
Are you coming to Lou's party?

97
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,649
I gotta talk to Courtney.
I'm... I don't know.

98
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,364
- How is Courtney?
- You know.

99
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,220
Oh, really? Still fighting, huh?

100
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,060
Why don't you just write her
a Josh Groban song?

Hello?

104
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,763
(SNORTING) Oh, shit!

105
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,849
Cocaine!

106
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,485
- Fuck me!
- (COCKS GUN)

107
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,443
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

108
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,980
Don't fucking sneak up
on me like that, huh?

109
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,340
Knock on something.

110
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,740
You took most of the doors out
and put beads up, Lou.

111
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,300
What am I supposed to fucking knock on?

112
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,740
What do you want?

113
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,241
Put it down!
What do you want, a round of applause?

114
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,860
"Thank you, Jacob, for making sure
we don't starve to death.

115
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,380
"Even though this is
completely ridiculous

116
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,780
"and inappropriate, what we're doing."
You're welcome, Mom and Dad.

117
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,723
I'm just happy that you guys are happy.

118
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,844
The fuck are you still doing here?

119
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,810
Today's my birthday, by the way.

120
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,566
Happy Birthday!

121
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,407
- Oh, thanks, Mom.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

122
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,249
I got you... I got you something.
It'll be here tomorrow via FedEx.

123
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,580
Right.

124
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,980
Daddy's little buddy
is turning into Daddy's big buddy.

125
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,260
I'm going to help you out.
It's not really my birthday.

126
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,600
Do you know what day it is?

127
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,122
Mmm... (POPS)

128
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,260
Okay.

129
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,420
Enjoy your shit.

130
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,380
The sooner you choke to death on it,
the sooner I get all this.

131
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,881
Any other questions,
or is this interview over?

132
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,963
Don't let the lack of a door
hit you on the way out.

133
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,300
(SIGHS) He just gets me so mad.

134
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,561
So, who is he?

135
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,140
That's my butler.

136
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,890
And our son, consequently.

137
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,365
Oh, my God, right.

138
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,051
Lisa Loeb?

139
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,500
Oh, my God. I can't believe
Nick Webber knows

140
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,886
the name of the cat wrangler.

141
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,645
Yeah. Crazy, right?

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,605
You know, I just have to tell you,
I really love this song so much.

143
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,563
- It feels so personal.
- Mmm.

144
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,928
It's almost... Violating.

145
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,244
(SOFTLY) I'm so sorry.

146
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,885
LOU: Yeah!

147
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,411
Nailed it!

148
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,405
All rise!

Uh, Mr. Dorchen, could we get
this board meeting started?

Yeah. Brad, do your thing.

Ladies and gentlemen,

- Lougle is at a crossroads.
- Whoo!

155
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,488
We did it, guys!
We got to the crossroads!

156
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,644
Our competitors,
Lycos and GeoCities, are crushing us.

157
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,763
Those guys are fucking nerds, Brad.

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,846
MALE ANNOUNCER 1: Tune in tomorrow
for the challenge round.

479
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,123
Eat a boot? Eat your feelings.
Choozy Doozy.

480
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,209
I think I may be Mr. Dorchen.

481
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,820
- What? No.
- I think this is my house.

482
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,684
- No way.
- I think he's right, Lou.

483
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,961
- That's impossible.
- You heard it.

484
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,491
- It just answered me.
- Uh-uh!

485
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,460
MALE ANNOUNCER 2: March 26, 2025.

486
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,460
From Comedy Central's World News
headquarters in New York.com,

487
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,847
this is The Daily Show
with Jessica Williams.

488
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,007
2025.

489
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,460
(AUDIENCE CHEERING ON TV)

490
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,900
Hey! Welcome to The Daily Show.
I'm Jessica Williams.

491
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,340
Tonight's guest, Dame Jennifer Lawrence

492
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,683
promoting her Meryl Streep
biopic, Streepin' It Real.

493
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,525
Hey, how do they get the people
to be on this show?

494
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,940
So, by now you've all seen
the NSA satellite footage

495
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,460
of the road rage incident

496
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,803
between two self-driving
smart cars in New Detroit.

497
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,287
President Neil Patrick Harris has called
for greater regulation of the industry,

498
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,660
while congressional Republicans defend
every sentient automobile's

499
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,340
constitutional right
to shoot a black car

500
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,771
if it's actin' funny.

501
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,120
(LAUGHS)

502
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,100
This show's still got it.

503
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,886
Holy shit.
We went 10 years into the future.

504
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,566
Whoa.

505
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,202
I'm distinguished.

506
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,801
Oh, I should shave this, right?

507
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,580
Yeah, that's not a good look.

508
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,409
This is so smooth,
I don't think I went bald.

509
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,540
I think this is a choice,

510
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,961
like Andre Agassi
or Bruce Willis or something.

511
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,460
You don't look anything like
either of those two people.

512
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,007
For one, they're fit and handsome
and you're neither of those things.

513
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,929
You look like a turtle
crawled out of his shell.

514
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,620
Fuck you for making me bald.

515
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,380
You look like
an orchestra conductor for stray cats.

516
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,860
You look like you give
lectures on public access.

517
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,724
You look like a grown-up Gerber baby.

518
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,640
LOU: You look like an egg
gave birth to another egg.

519
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,220
You look like Gandalf the Poor.

520
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,260
(CHUCKLES)

521
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,488
You look like
you advise Lando Calrissian.

522
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,540
That's a good one.

523
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,081
You look like the guy that owns
the one house that ruins the whole street.

524
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,980
Have I bombed anything, you think?

525
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,060
You look like
you've never made a correct decision.

526
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,286
Ever.

527
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,125
I have definitely given
a back-alley blowjob.

528
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,563
- I gotta admit I kinda like this.
- I want to hit you into the corner pocket.

529
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,420
Now I know why the coat-check
girl didn't like me.

530
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,329
I look like fucking shit.

531
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,380
So far so good on this future shit, huh?

532
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,940
Yeah. You know what?

533
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,281
I don't feel like anything
bad's going to happen.

534
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,860
Uh-oh.

535
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,460
Hey, check it out. I found all
the gear from the painting.

536
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,580
- Cool, huh?
- Whoa.

537
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,045
(LAUGHING)

538
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,764
What happened
to the bottom of your suit?

539
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,325
That pesky little doggie eat it?

540
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,125
It's called fashion, Lou.

541
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,521
You look like...

542
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,780
- Nope, not doing anymore "You look like."
- But you look like...

543
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,020
I don't give a shit.
We did it on the stairs.

544
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,531
We did it in front of the mirror.
It'd be tacky to do it a third time.

545
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,540
Anyway, do you guys
want some fresh clothes?

546
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,980
I got a whole closet full of stuff.

547
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,140
I love this shirt. My shit is fly.

548
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,208
Weren't you listening
to my speech, dude?

549
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,169
Always pack a bag.

550
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,290
Hey, is that...

551
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,780
- No. It is not.
- How did you get that?

552
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,260
- I didn't get...
- I know what it...

553
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,566
I saw what it said.

554
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,940
It doesn't say anything!

555
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,180
Was that the Cincinnati box?

556
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,566
(BOTH SHUSHING)

557
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,246
- Don't say that out loud.
- It might hear you.

558
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,408
You're really never
going to tell me what's inside that box?

559
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,451
Okay, we'll tell you. We'll tell him.

560
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,405
- I'm going to tell him.
- NICK: Lou.

561
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,260
It's the Declaration of Independence
with a map on the back.

562
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,408
- Our family's chosen.
- Yep.

563
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,420
That's just the plot of that
movie National Treasure.

564
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,521
It's the Ark of the Covenant.

565
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,860
That's Raiders of the Lost Ark.
You're not even tryin'.

566
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,769
I mean, that's not even
anything that could be in the box.

567
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,540
Okay, this has gone on long enough.

568
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,660
Okay.

569
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,731
It's a ring that turns you invisible
and carries with it the power of evil.

570
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,366
I've seen fucking movies,
you guys! I've seen movies!

571
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,380
Wait, why are you alive?

572
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,500
What?

573
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,380
Why are you alive? We're in the future.

574
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,100
Yeah, you know what? He's right.

575
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,009
'Cause if we went back in time,
you'd be alive.

576
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,820
But we went 10 years
in the fuckin' future.

577
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,046
You should be dead.

578
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,605
Yeah, what the fuck?

579
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,420
What you should be
asking yourselves is,

580
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,140
- "When the fuck?"
- (ALL GASPING)

581
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,129
God damn it!

582
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,620
This fucking guy again!

583
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,721
Why do you do that?

584
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,564
LOU: He's not going to tell us anything.

585
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,081
Hey, why don't you make like a fuck off
and get out of here?

586
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,040
Wait. So all we have to do is go back
and Lou's gonna be okay, right?

587
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,120
It's not that simple, really.

588
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,362
The hot tub doesn't take you
where you want to go.

589
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,860
It takes you where you need to go.

590
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,961
Come on!

591
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,820
There are
certain calculations and innovations

592
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,129
and salutations that haven't
even come to pass yet.

593
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,090
What the hell does that mean?

594
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,528
What it means is, at the present,
your tub here is just a tub.

595
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,166
Wait, are you saying
that time travel is not even possible?

596
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,051
Right on, Liz.
Give the pretty lady a flower.

597
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,491
- Damn it.
- Lizzie.

598
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,620
That's bullshit, okay?

599
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,564
We got a whole vault
of nitro right here. (GASPS)

600
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,162
Where'd it go? Where did it go?

601
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,004
What did you do with my nitro?

602
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,925
How can I take what doesn't exist yet?

603
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,447
It exists in the past.
How can it not exist in the future?

604
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,166
The past, the future. All very cute.

605
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,460
But who's to say the past
isn't anything more

606
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,847
than the future of this present?

607
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,940
So, nitro is from the future?

608
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,060
(SIGHS)

609
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,446
Like Terminator.

610
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,980
- Yeah.
- Oh! Oh, my God.

611
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,082
You think everything is like Terminator.

612
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,850
'Cause everything is like Terminator!

613
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,008
Arnold's hand gets
chopped off in the past,

614
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,203
somebody finds it, reverse
engineers that shit. Boom!

615
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,620
Terminators running all
around this motherfucker.

616
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,006
That's how we got nitro?

617
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,687
I don't know. I never saw Terminator.

618
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,048
Oh, fuck this guy and his riddles!

619
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,964
- (VOCALIZING)
- (GRUNTS)

620
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,604
Thanks for holding him down for me!

621
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,740
"Hold him down"?

622
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,740
So you can beat to death
the mystical time baron

623
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,330
that holds the keys
to our very existence?

624
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,980
That's your fucking plan here?

625
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,206
(SCOFFS) Shut up.

626
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,780
Tighten your shit up, Lou.
We needed him.

627
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,041
Amateur hour.

628
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,370
This thing is awesome.

629
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,820
I probably invented it.

630
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,843
"Lou Sux

631
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,244
"Cox N Dix." Flip it.
(LAUGHS)

632
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,921
Okay.

633
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,620
Try to stay with me.

634
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,563
This is going to get complicated.

635
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,648

(LOU GROANS)

637
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,526
And you're dead.

638
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,569
So Lou is killed in our present,

639
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,300
which means that here,
in the future, he should still be dead.

640
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,561
Well, clearly, he's not fuckin' dead,

641
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,569
'cause he's sittin' here,
still bothering me.

642
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,100
So what that tells me is

643
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,820
we're in a completely different future

644
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,400
on a completely different timeline.

645
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,091
Jacob, I'm the Sarlacc.

647
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,460
JACOB: Okay.

648
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,244
Anyway, the Repairman said

649
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,843
that the past is actually the future
of the present we're in right now.

650
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,410
So I think what that means is
the killer is from the future.

651
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,202
So clearly, someone from 2025
will go back in time and shoot Lou.

652
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,771
Like Looper.

653
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,121
Wow!

654
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,340
How about a fucking spoiler alert?

655
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,540
"Hey, Lou, you want to go see Looper?"

656
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,449
"Nah, I got a thing I gotta do."

657

It's in my queue! That counts.

658

It's the first Bruce Willis
movie we missed.

659
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,010
- Is Bruce in that?
- JACOB: Okay.

660
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,860
Plainly, just by virtue of
Lou being here alive in 2025

661
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,327
when we know that he died in 2015,

662
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,220
we're here to stop his future murder.

663
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,020

- Exactly.

Did you just say "high five"
instead of high-fiving?

669
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,811
- High five.
- High five.

knocked down perfectly

I gotta go. Let's go.

- JACOB: Sorry.
- Sorry, bro, we gotta go.

797
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,460
Nice skirt, by the way.

798

- Thank you.
- JILL: I have the dress.

799
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,620
Wait, who said anything about a dress?

800
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,200
I certainly didn't say
anything about the dress.

801
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,420
Oh.

802

I'm sorry. I didn't realize
that Adam had guests.

803

- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

804
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,020
Guys, meet Jill. Jill, meet the guys.

805
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,980
We're getting married this weekend.

806
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,970
Uh, me and Jill, not me and you guys.

807
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,340
Oh, stop it. You're gonna make milk
come out of my nose.

808
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,300
- Milk? What milk?
- I had milk earlier.

809

Are you Nick Webber?

811

Yes. Yes, I am.

Would you please do the Webber Strut?

813
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,366
The Webber...

814
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,860
Come on, you know it.
He wants us to do it.

815
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,900

I still like your music.

Oh, I didn't tell you.

in hot tub time machine, too.

- They're looking for my dad.
- What?

- You have to go with them.
- Uh...

Would you guys mind?
It would be really, really great

847
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,340
to have my father at the wedding.

848

Fuck that. Fuck that.

No way in hell. No way in hell.

850
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,580
You gotta let Adam go.

851
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,900
I mean, this is exactly
the sort of thing that he needs.

852
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,820
We've been together for 10 years.
He hardly ever goes out.

853
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,331
He didn't even have a bachelor party.

854

Honey, you're making me
seem a little stiff.

Right.

All right. Well, you have fun
and make good choices.

Oh. Well, my mom used
to live near here,

873
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,448
so I figured we'd go by her old building
and see if we can find a clue.

874
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,700
Okay! Well, there's a 50-50 chance
I might murder your dad,

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,780
- Oh, Lou...
- You killed me!

948
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,882
I'm going to kill you
before you can kill me again!

949
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,660
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa...

950
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,129
That's hilarious.
Why would I kill you? I love you, man.

951
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,580
What?

952
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,490
Okay, okay, okay. All right. I'm fine.

953
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,806
You not buying that land

954
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,968
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

955
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,460
Because when Hurricane Beth
came through

956
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,780
and destroyed half the waterfront...
(EXHALES)

957
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,407
It turned this worthless piece of dirt
into a goldmine.

958
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,620
What?

959
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,180
So you didn't murder me?

960
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,727
What are you talking about?
I love you, man. (CHUCKLES)

961
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,860
So, are you boys coming up or what?

962
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,531
It's not a party unless
it's a Gary Winkle party.

963
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,210
At Gary Winkle's.

964
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,966
The Wink.

965
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,401
- What are you doing?
- It's a double wink.

966
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,620
Ah, technically, that's more of a blink.

967
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,484
- That's a blink.
- You can't wink, can you?

968
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,011
(SCOFFS) Of course I can wink.

969
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,161
Prove it.

970
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,121
Yeah.

971
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,260
Let me do this. Hold on.

972
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,488
Let me hold this open.
I'll hold this open.

973
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,081
Now do it.

974
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,940
BOTH: See?

975
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,121
Can we go to the fuckin' party now?

976
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,124
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

977
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,530
Welcome to The Wink!

978
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,888
Hey, jugglers, give my boys
anything they want...

979
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,051
From that shelf down.

980
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,580
- Lou, what are we doing here?
- You know.

981
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,420
Winkle is not the killer. We gotta go.

982
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,860
I don't care,
'cause there's cocaine right there.

983
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,220
Didn't you see the cocaine?
Look, look, look.

984
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,580
I see the cocaine. So what?

985
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,420
Well, I'm going to do that.
So, first... And then...

986
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,700
Look, I'm not flickering. Am I flickering?
You cannot say that I'm flickering.

987
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,100
We're on a mission to save your life.

988
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,929
You think I don't want
to roll my dick around some cocaine,

989
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,140
- and get titty-slapped?
- Okay.

990
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,460
Pop some bottles?
Do some crazy future shit?

991
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,700
I'm trying to keep you from flickering.

992
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,980
- What the fuck are you doing?
- LOU: Good talk.

993
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,686
Thank you. And popping bottles,
that's old school.

994
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,940
You bringing that back?

995
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,180
- Yeah.
- (CHUCKLES)

996
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,805
I like that. I like you.

997
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,247
(SIGHS)

998
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,340
Uh-oh.

999
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,851
What are these?
I don't care.

1000
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,609
Oh. So, Nick, listen, I was so sorry
to hear about you and Courtney.

1001
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,167
- What do you mean?
- Ah.

1002
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,562
Gotcha. Forget I even brought it up.

1003
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,245
No, no, no, really, what do you mean?

1004
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,289
I hear you loud and clear, man.

1005
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,620
I don't think you hear me at all.

1006
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,020
Hey, Sophie!

1007
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,724
There you are.

1008
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,250
I have a surprise for you.

1009
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,561
Oh. Uh...

1010
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,087
Sophie has a surprise for me.

1011
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,686
Bye, dude!

1012
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,980
I'll take a room-temperature
almond milk, please.

1013
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,050
No, actually,
I'll get a tangerine margarita.

1014
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,566
No. Scratch that.

1015
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,620
I'll take just an apricot sliced into fours.
And a kiwi.

1016
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,405
Do you have kiwi?
I'll take a kiwi, sliced up.

1017
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,060
A banana thrown in there.

1018
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,780
You know what? Dealer's choice.

1019
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,120
Just a fruit salad.

1020
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,900
Should we go somewhere more private?

1021
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,340
(LAUGHS)

1022
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,522
Jacob Dorchen wants privacy.

1023
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,100
That's so 2018.

1024
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,201
Right, right.

1025
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,489
No. Get that out of here.

1026
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,500
I mean,
I wouldn't mind a little something.

1027
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,443
Remember, we agreed?

1028
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,860
Look at your dad.

1029
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,406
You're not going down
that road anymore.

1030
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,161
Oh, God, I'm so good at that!

1031
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,660
(GRUNTS) Yes!

1032
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,780
(VOCALIZING) It's Satan.

1033
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,300
Like, I'll finger your dog,
I don't care.

1034
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,050
As a joke! As a joke!

1035
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,401
I have some advice for you.

1036
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,780
If you don't want to be
considered a sex offender,

1037
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,180
don't take a shit in a sandbox

1038
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,100
that happens to be in a playground.

1039
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,380
Okay? Don't do it. 'Cause guess what?

1040
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,324
You have two things, a record
and a fucking nickname.

1041
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,500
I know it's a potentially risky move...
Wedding sorbet!

1042
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,300
- Mmm.
- As a palate cleanser, of course.

1043
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,447
I mean, I'm not insane.

1044
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,922
Oh, my God! Fuckin' A!
You're Nick Webber, man!

1045
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,380
Let's take a picture!
I can't believe it's you, man.

1046
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,460
I'm gonna send this to everyone.

1047
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,540
- I'm gonna get, like, a billion views!
- NICK: Okay.

1048
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,140
I remember when I first heard
that stupid song. I was like,

1049
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,641
"Man, that song is so dumb."

1050
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,406
Do the Strut.

1051
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,740
- Do the Strut.
- No, I'm good.

1052
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,966
You won't do the fucking song?

1053
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,980
- You want to see the Strut?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1054
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,300
DJ: (LAUGHS) Hey, yo! Check this out!

1055
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,900
Nick Webber's in the house,
so get ready for the original

1056
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,128
- Webber Strut!
- (ALL CHEERING)

1057
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,660
Before that, let's back it up.

1058
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,081
Six years ago, see where it all began.

1059
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,530
I made a lot of mistakes.
I've taken advantage.

1060
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,280
And now I'm ready to be original.

1061
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,060
This is dedicated to
those who never got to be,

1062
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,491
because of me.

1063
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,121
Strut to the time of the clock

1064
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,762
It's midnight
Everybody strut right now

1065
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,780
Nick Webber
Nick Webber

1066
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,689
You don't know but you think you know

1067
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,842
Nick Webber
Nick Webber

1068
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,440
You don't know, but you will

1069
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,571
Everybody do the
Strut, strut, strut

1070
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,885
Everybody do the
Strut, strut, strut

1071
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,180
Everybody do the

1072
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,725
(CROWD LAUGHING
AND APPLAUDING)

1073
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,010
(GASPS) Oh.

1074
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,521
Oh, this room is so much better
than the other room.

1075
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,041
What?

1076
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,681
No!

1077
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,887
Look at him go. Chip off the old block.

1078
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,420
(LAUGHS)

1079
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,660
Okay, be nice.

1080
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,260
Be nice. Be nice. Be nice.
Be nice. Be nice. Be nice.

1081
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,362
Hmm. Son!

1082
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,923
Hey! What a coincidence!

1083
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,204
Wondering where you ran off to,
but here you are.

1084
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,540
Who let you in here?

1085
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,060
Would you go find your murderer?

1086
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,020
Think your old man can get in
on a little of this action? Or...

1087
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,724
This is... This is a private party.

1088
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,171
This one's mine.

1089
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,325
What? Yes! See?

1090
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,481
Ha! Still got it!

1091
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,820
What are the, uh... house rules here?

1092
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,980
I just want to know what to do.

1093
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,801
I don't want to break any rules,
get chucked out right away, you know?

1094
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,161
- That'd be fucked up.
- Touch me, you filthy vagrant.

1095
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,691
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

1096
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,660
JACOB: (LAUGHS)
Oh! Wait, what was that?

1097
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,380
Nothing. It wasn't anything.

1098
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,481
You just flickered.

1099
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,900
No, I'd flickered? No, I didn't.

1100
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,980
How did you do that?

1101
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,500
He's threatening his own existence.

1102
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,780
Lou, you can't be here,

Waffles, waffles.
It's a neck-and-neck with...

BRITT: You just got very lucky,
my friend, because you were almost

1267
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,100
about to have to eat
a whole bunch of waffles!

1268
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,340
I'm willing to do that. I'm willing...
I'll eat the waffles.

1269
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,521
Okay, now...

1270
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,180
Who had the idea of this man
fornicating with a gentleman?

What exactly is this?

1285

It's the number one show on TV.

we're supposed to fuck.

Okay, if this is the most popular show,
give me some of the other shows?

- Building Explosion?
- Yeah, Building Explosion.

1311
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,220
It just shows big buildings
falling down, and...

1312
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,780
Kids, like, trapped in the basement,
and the building falls,

and they're like,
"Ma, get me out of here."

1314

And it shows them how
to get out in an emergency,

because the llama needs to graze?

01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,300
Oh, like that would be
the craziest fucking thing

1418
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,300
that's ever happened to us.
That car's an asshole.

1419
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,006
The car's not an asshole.
You're an asshole.

1420
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,620
Whoa. Where'd that come from?

1421
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,100
Everything is all about Lou.
No regard for anybody else.

1422
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,500
I'm pretty sure that's never
been the case at all, ever.

1423
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,841
Because of you, Adam just got raped.

1424
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,460
Are we calling it a rape?

1425
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,050
Whoa! Nobody got raped.

1426
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,611
It felt like kind of a gray area.

1427
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,330
You're a fucking virus, Lou.

1428
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,010
You find a vulnerable host,

1429
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,140
and you attach yourself
and you just fuck 'em all up.

1430
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,366
LOU: (SCOFFS) Okay.

1431
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,201
Okay. Someone needs
to find a chill-out tent.

1432
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,500
Let's get you a comfy couch and
a video game. What do you say?

1433
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,860
Where does it say in the Shitty Parent's
Handbook to treat your son like shit?

1434
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,540
Well, if it's a Shitty Parent's
Handbook,

1435
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,086
wouldn't it be, like,
the theme of the whole book?

1436
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,043
- No, he's right. Wait.
- NICK: No, no, no.

1437
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,766
It's a step-by-step guide
for how to be a shitty parent.

1438
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,380
- Exactly.
- Shitty Parenting for Dummies.

1439
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,420
Okay. You're right. I apologize.

1440
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,260
I apologize. You were totally wrong.

1441
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,060
No, why would someone write that book?
Why would that book exist?

1442
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,660
Actually, Nick's idea about retitling it

1443
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,860
Shitty Parenting for Dummies
is a solid idea.

1444
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,060
- If you want to use the metaphor again.
- LOU: It's an impulse buy.

1445
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,060
All right, you know what?
Forget it. You're right, that's fair.

1446
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,020
It was a misleading title.
But the point is...

1447
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,380
Fuck you!

1448
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,700
If they're not gonna say it, I will.

1449
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,140
I am so tired of solving your problems.

1450
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,460
You wanna stop your murder,
figure it out yourself.

1451
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,540
I'm going to Winkle's.

1452
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,540
- Jacob, what the fuck?
- Youngblood!

1453
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,020
No. You know why?
'Cause as long as we're here,

1454
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,660
I'm Jacob fucking Dorchen!
And that means something.

1455
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,860
Jacob, come on!

1456
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,485
Youngblood, we got to figure this out.

1457
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,285
LOU: You're the only one
keeping track of important stuff!

1458
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,121
I mean...

1459
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,487
You know what? Fuck it. Fuck it.

1460
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,443
Who cares? Who needs him?
I don't need him.

1461
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,340
Hey, I'm getting married today, guys.

1462
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,220
What do you say we kick this day
in the pants

1463
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,260
and get over there early
for some Bloody Mary-tinis?

1464
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,940
I'm sorry.
Can I just get rid of this thing?

1465
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,520
No! She said not to
take it off for 24 hours.

1466
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,900
- Or what?
- I don't know.

1467
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,140
Yeah, exactly.
If I had a dime for every time

1468
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,940
I did something a cocktail waitress
told me not to do,

1469
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,530
I'd be rich. Look.

1470
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,005
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

1471
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,322
Oh, my God,
the cocktail waitress was wrong.

1472
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,460
Sorry, my mistake.

1473
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,925
I should listen to you more often, Lou.

1474
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,260
- All right.
- (SIGHS)

1475
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,500
You just learned a valuable life lesson.

1476
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,761
I did.

1477
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,567
Guys?

1478
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,481
Come on.

1479
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,047
Mmm...

1480
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,925
Ew, God. So...

1481
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,166
(GASPING)

1482
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,729
- 911, right?
- Yeah.

1483
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,526
(RETCHES)

1484
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,361
LOU: Ugh.

1485
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,522
Fucking disgusting, dude!

1486
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,081
Okay, you're sick. You made your point.

1487
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,521
Come on, Lou,
you know he can't help it.

1488
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,681
You okay, buddy?

1489
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,820
(GURGLES)

1490
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,207
Okay, this is becoming
a bit of a hygiene issue.

1491
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,522
KELLY: All right, let's see
what we have here.

1492
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,483
Okay, yeah.

1493
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,121
Kel.

1494
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,580
Come on, really?

1495
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,809
Divorced? What the fuck
are you talking about?

1496
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,285
Kelly, we're soul mates.

1497
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,805
Not anymore.

1498
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,327
- Mommy?
- No, I'm not your mommy.

1499
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,202
- Homie?
- Yeah, I'm your homie.

1500
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,441
Was it... Was it something you did?

1501
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,780
If so, I don't care.
I don't care. I forgive you.

1502
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,370
- Put this in his mouth.
- (ADAM GROANS)

1503
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,700
If you don't communicate with me,
I can't fix this!

1504
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,961
You can't fix anything.

1505
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,140
Hey, bite down on this. Good. Okay.

1506
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,321
What's going on?

1507
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,561
Here we go.

1508
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,407
Okay.

1509
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,700
Oh, that's actually not bad.

1510
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,290
You know, it's, like, kind of sweet.

1511
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,131
What's happening to him?

1512
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,446
Oh, this is totally normal.

1513
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,164
The nanobots are attacking
the narcotics.

1514
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,085
How long has he been on heroin?

1515
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,401
It was a Ladybug.

1516
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,563
- Wait, the sticker?
- Yeah, on the neck.

1517
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,481
Yeah. We normally give Tylenol for that.

1518
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,980
I just pumped him full of...

1519
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,500
Narcotic-seeking nanobots?

1520
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,965
- Yeah.
- Whoops.

1521
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,844
You're a great listener.
I should have married you.

1522
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,684
LOU: Look, Kel, I'm sorry, okay?

1523
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,446
I'm sorry.

1524
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,580
(ADAM GROANS)

1525
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,091
Can we just move on?

1526
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,521
I did move on, Lou. I got clean.

1527
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,762
You're the one who doesn't
have a rock bottom.

1528
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,082
I just pray that
there's still hope for Jacob.

1529
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,180
GARY: This ain't a circus!

1530
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,601
Quick juggling
and make some fucking drinks!

1531
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,205
Hey! Jake the Snake!

1532
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,931
Hey, is it still day out there?
Who gives a shit? What can I get you?

1533
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,531
I'll take everything!

1534
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,260
(CHUCKLES)

1535
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,340
You sure about that?

1536
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,965
'Cause, remember what
happened last time?

1537
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,531
Everything.

1538
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,281
Okay.

1539
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,420
All right!
Set Mr. Dorchen up with the usual...

1540
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,807
And, you know, call security.

1541
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,020
KELLY:
The nanobots can't find any drugs,

1542
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,780
so they're traveling to
the lowest part of his body,

1543
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,340
where they'll harden and expand.

1544
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,700
- His feet?
- In his testicles.

1545
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,802
Well, that hardly seems like
the lowest part of his body.

1546
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,042
- Shit!
- What's happening?

1547
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,620
Okay. It's now or never.

1548
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,801
ADAM: (STAMMERING)
What are you doing?

1549
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,700
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- (LAUGHS)

1550
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,780
What is that?

1551
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:34,940
What you gonna do with that?

1552
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,041
Stick him! Stick him!

1553
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,491
(SCREAMING)

1554
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,411
(SCREAMING)

1555
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,166
(EXCLAIMS) Oh, shit!

1556
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,090
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

1557
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,580
That's a lot of juice!

1558
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,011
Okay! Enough!

1559
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,300
Now what's gonna happen,
I'm going to pull this out,

1560
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,740
and there might be some leakage, okay?

1561
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,460
(STAMMERS)
Don't pull it out. Don't pull it out.

1562
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,688
- I like it where it is.
- KELLY: One, two, three...

1563
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,160
(ADAM SCREAMING)

1564
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,050
Ha! Ah!

1565
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,090
- LOU: Oh, wow! Okay.
- Fuck your ball juice!

1566
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,201
(SPITS)

1567
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,891
Oh, I walked right into that one.
Literally.

1568
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,642
Oh, I don't know about you guys,
but I feel way better.

1569
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,684
There's definitely semen in that.

1570
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,082
There's definitely fucking
semen in that.

1571
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,364

Hey, Nick Webber. Do the dance.

01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,405
You want me to do the dance?

1735

Yeah, do the dance.
