00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,062
Today marks the 10th anniversary of the Fuyuki Fire.

3
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:04,231
A memorial service is underway at the city's central park.

4
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:11,363
The cause of the disaster that claimed
over 500 lives remains a mystery.

5
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:15,159
At the disaster site, the ground remains scarred.

6
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:22,458
About 400 of the bereaved offer prayers
and flowers to the victims.

7
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:33,135
I can't eat another bite.

8
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,848
It's getting late.

9
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,562
I should be going.

10
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:48,692
I'll take you home. It's not safe out.

11
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,030
Don't forget to lock up.

12
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,659
That's a no-no, Kiritsugu.

13
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,623
Thanks.

14
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:07,962
Are you kidding? You were a great help.

15
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:13,509
Well, it's fun having dinner with a lot of people.
Beats eating alone.

16
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,599
Your hand!

17
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,645
I must've cut it cleaning up.

18
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,022
Hear thee!

19
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,275
I command thee to my side.

20
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,111
And entrust my fate in thy sword.

21
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,572
Heeding to Holy Grail's refuge.

22
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:38,742
If thou surrender to this will and reason,
answer my call.

23
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,369
Offer thine oath.

24
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,747
I embody Virtue in the Eternal World.

25
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,168
I chastise Evil in the Eternal World.

26
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,672
Thou art the Seven Heavens
harboring the great spirit trinity.

27
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,389
Come forth O Keeper of Balance!

28
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,242
The Holy Grail Wars.

29
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,162
Seven Magi locked for centuries
in an epic struggle...

30
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,832
for a Holy Grail that can grant its owner
every wish and absolute power.

31
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:32,546
In their battles, the Magi enlist the help
of astral spirits called Servants.

32
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:38,427
Meanwhile, the Holy Grail
awaits the emergence of a victor.

33
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:44,308
A single human Magi it deems
most worthy of its stewardship.

34
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:51,106
The Servants are spirits of legendary heroes
from history to whom the Grail has given flesh.

35
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:56,487
They exist on an astral plane
and accompany the Magi.

36
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:03,077
But when necessary can be summoned as
material beings and made to battle each other.

37
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,081
Such is the Grail's miraculous power.

38
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:11,252
And he who can obtain it...
shall be master of the universe.

39
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,128
Who's there?

40
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,847
Oh no! Someone's still here.

41
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,235
Yo.

42
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,114
Time to die.

43
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:51,852
I am Servant Saber. You summoned me.

44
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,401
I ask you.

45
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,448
Are you my Master?

46
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,484
Shiro Emiya.

47
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,280
You now inhabit a new world...

48
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,660
...where you must learn to kill or be killed.

49
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:54,540
For you are now a Master.

50
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,793
I will fight.

51
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:03,090
I'll end this senseless war.

52
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,557
Be happy, young man.

53
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,935
Your wish is at last fulfilled.

54
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,938
No posturing necessary.

55
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:22,109
As a human, your struggle is a just one.

56
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:31,410
Hey, you realize that we're
supposed to be enemies.

57
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,786
Enemies?

58
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:41,753
I brought you to Kirei's church
because you didn't know anything.

59
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,506
But you're a Magus now, right?

60
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,801
That leaves only one thing for us to do.

61
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,219
Oh, yeah.

62
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,138
What're you doing?

63
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,224
Don't give your enemy time to prepare.

64
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,560
I know that!

65
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,021
Then make a move.

66
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:02,107
Don't tell me you plan to show mercy.

67
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,067
'Course not!

68
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,654
It's just that...

69
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:13,243
I want to fight fair. That's all.

70
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,496
How tiresome.

71
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,459
Let's call it a day.

72
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,755
Starting tomorrow, though... we're enemies.

73
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,298
Gotcha.

74
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,176
Hey, Tosaka... you're all right.

75
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:33,805
What? Stop that!
Don't think I'll go easy on you.

76
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,349
I understand.

77
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,269
But I'd rather we didn't have to be enemies.

78
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:43,106
You're just the sort of person...

79
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,108
...I admire.

80
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,413
Look, just be careful, all right?

81
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:03,710
Saber may be good, but if
you get yourself killed, it's all over.

82
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:18,016
Illyasviel! And Berserker!

83
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,441
Stand back, Shiro!

84
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,614
Crush him, Berserker.

85
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,605
Saber!

86
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,203
An invisible sword.

87
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,699
Saber!

88
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,301
Saber!

89
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,262
No! You wanna die?!

90
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,013
I can't leave Saber.

91
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:06,977
Shiro!

92
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,312
Archer?

93
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,275
Get out of the way? Of what?

94
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,961
Shiro!

95
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,466
That's...

96
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,426
Archer's weapon.

97
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:29,184
Like Berserker, he was aiming for me...

98
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:36,399
Unconcerned by you and
Tosaka's presence nearby.

99
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,619
I'm impressed, Rin.

100
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,872
Your Archer is pretty good.

101
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,713
Let's go home, Berserker.

102
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:08,014
Bye-bye. See you soon, Big Brother.

103
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,398
Shiro!

104
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,859
Emiya!

105
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,840
Are you serious?

106
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,302
Berserker is stronger than I expected.

107
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:51,558
Fighting Saber and Shiro isn't wise right now.

108
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,355
I beg to differ. They're an encumbrance.

109
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,190
Reconsider, Rin.

110
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,902
Are you disobeying your Master?

111
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:15,206
I can't do that. As long as you're my Master.

112
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,791
Wait.

113
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:22,380
You haven't yet told me what Epic Spirit you are.

114
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,842
Do you recall your real name?

115
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,470
No, not yet.

116
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,934
My memory betrays me.

117
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,729
Shall I tell you why?

118
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,775
Because you summoned me prematurely.

119
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,820
Why you conceited... Hey!

120
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,406
Get back here and help me move!

121
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,351
Ow.

122
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,648
A dream?

123
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,777
May I have more?

124
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,028
Of course.

125
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,322
You're not a fussy eater?

126
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:34,119
No. If prepared well, I can eat anything.

127
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:38,623
How do you stay so slim eating so much?
I'm jealous!

128
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,166
Morning!

129
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,585
I'm starving! I need nourishment!

130
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:59,352
Hey! Since when are we running a guesthouse?

131
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,439
You'd better have a good answer.

132
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,774
My apologies.

133
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:10,321
I should've told you sooner, Miss Fujimura.

134
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,783
My home is being renovated and...

135
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,039
You don't say!

136
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,210
Then your sister arrived from overseas, huh?

137
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,088
Sounds hectic.

138
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,342
I planned to take off school and stay in a hotel.

139
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,055
But then Shiro offered to help.

140
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,932
I didn't want to impose but...

141
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,018
Don't be silly!

142
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:44,564
This house and Shiro...

143
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,441
...are yours to do as you please.

144
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,735
Thank you.

145
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,819
Refill!

146
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,820
Me too, please.

147
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,072
Of course.

148
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,577
Sakura, you'll be late for training. Hurry!

149
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,205
Coming. Sorry.

150
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,956
Let's move!

151
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:02,957
Okay.

152
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,169
Following me to school?

153
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:09,214
Servants protect their Magi.

154
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,966
The school's full of people.

155
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,677
I'll be fine. You wait here.

156
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:22,477
If you say so, Master,
I've no choice but to believe you.

157
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,647
But promise me one thing.

158
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,444
If you sense any danger, call me.

159
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:36,241
If you feel you need my help,
those thoughts will reach me.

160
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,953
But if there isn't enough time,
use a Command Spell.

161
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,455
Okay. I promise.

162
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,876
<i>Homurabara Academy
Senior High School</i>

163
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,812
What is this?

164
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,775
This sickeningly sweet sensation...

165
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,415
Yo Emiya!

166
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,083
Hurry or you'll be tardy.

167
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,501
Shinji.

168
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,297
What's wrong? You look a little pale.

169
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,342
Nothing. Just felt dizzy for a second.

170
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:40,805
Don't worry me, all right? You look like death.

171
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,396
A force field?

172
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:53,985
There's another Magus at this school.
He's cast a force field around it.

173
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,071
So that's what I felt.

174
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,616
But for what aim?

175
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:04,913
Servants store up mana
by consuming spiritual energy.

176
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:09,667
By feeding on the students,
he strengthens his Servant.

177
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,211
How cowardly!

178
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:16,466
The force field is weak. I can keep it neutralized.

179
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,135
We'd better find this Magus.

180
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,224
Hear that?

181
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,808
A scream.

182
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,394
Emiya, wait!

183
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,821
She must've just fainted.

184
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:42,825
That's not it. Her vitality's been drained.

185
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,578
Wait, I think I can revive her.

186
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,060
See to her.

187
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:10,979
Emiya!

188
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:46,389
I didn't expect you'd wander over here alone.

189
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,225
Shinji!

190
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:07,410
Aren't you going to call your Servant?

191
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:12,999
Emiya's a bit slow. I'm sure he's forgotten how.

192
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:20,173
So you're the one responsible for this force field.

193
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:25,845
Correct. And I can kill
anyone in it, if I so choose.

194
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,513
Stop it!

195
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:33,728
What? Who are you to give me orders?

196
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,855
Shinji!

197
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,817
You annoy me, Emiya.

198
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,152
Just die.

199
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,014
Let's go, Rider.

200
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,521
So he's our perpetrator.

201
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,439
Yeah, it's Shinji.

202
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,608
How's the girl?

203
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,235
She'll be okay.

204
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,188
Shiro!

205
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,031
Come...

206
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,703
Saber!

207
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:30,928
Shiro!

208
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,930
They're all yours, Saber.

209
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,432
Understood, Master.

210
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:55,119
Ashes to ashes... dust to dust.

211
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,967
Let's get the force field's source!

212
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,738
Oh God.

213
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,251
Shinji! Why you...!

214
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:48,464
No! No, no, no, no!

215
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,841
No? How dare you!

216
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:54,345
Dissolve the force field now!

217
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:58,599
It wasn't me. I didn't kill them!

218
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,024
It was the Servant.

219
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:23,916
It wasn't me! Rider was obeying another!

220
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,960
Who?

221
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,712
I don't know!

222
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:45,062
It's my fault. I was careless.

223
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,189
They're breathing.

224
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,609
It's not too late!

225
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,195
They're all still alive.

226
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,201
Emiya, thank you.

227
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,412
No, really.

228
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,665
You stayed calm. I'm impressed.

229
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,376
We both lost ourselves a bit.

230
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:12,965
I'm used to seeing corpses. So I knew. That's all.

231
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,383
You are?

232
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:19,555
I'm surprised to see Saber here.

233
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:23,392
Yeah, where were you?

234
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:28,064
I came the moment
I sensed my Master in danger.

235
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:31,317
But by then it was over.

236
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:34,528
You're damn right it was!

237
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:39,075
Would you like to hear all about it?

238
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:44,121
While you were goofing off,
Shiro and I had our hands full!

239
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:47,667
Unwilling to fight, young man?

240
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:51,128
Without a Servant, how can I?

241
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,673
Rider was in it for herself!

242
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:55,800
So it's the Servant's fault?

243
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,804
Yeah. It wasn't my fault we lost.

244
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:04,058
And them... acting all high and mighty!

245
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:07,353
So you still desire to fight?

246
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,689
You're in luck.

247
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:13,567
There just happens to be a Servant available.

248
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:18,739
Come.

249
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,080
Come.

250
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,584
Come.

251
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,012
Come...

252
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,015
Come...

253
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,310
Come...

254
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,897
Come...

255
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,401
Come...

256
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,612
Come!

257
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,323
Welcome.

258
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:17,840
Let's have Saber destroy
that eyesore, Berserker.

259
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,092
To do so...

260
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,470
I'll need that Command Spell.

261
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,413
Who are you?!

262
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:53,959
Protector of Ryudo Temple,
the Servant Assassin.

263
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,795
You wish to pass?

264
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,673
Try if you dare.

265
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,291
You! Why'd you come?

266
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,086
Just passing through.

267
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,383
Archer! Assassin, where were you?

268
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:46,428
How curious. Two Servants in one place.

269
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:52,101
Caster, I see your Magus and
Assassin's Magus are in league.

270
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,812
In league?

271
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,816
With that mere pawn of a man?

272
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:02,570
Then you've broken the rules.

273
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:07,658
Oh? I am a Magus
who has summoned a Servant.

274
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,410
Is that a problem?

275
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,788
You're stealing human souls.

276
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:16,166
And using Assassin to fight for you.

277
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,969
Is that all?

278
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:38,522
Stop standing there!

279
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,070
Shiro!

280
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,325
What a nuisance.

281
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,286
Put me down!

282
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:57,291
Quiet! I feel stupid enough already.

283
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:21,273
Well? Can you move, Archer?

284
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,652
It looks like the end for you.

285
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:29,823
Saber's waiting outside.
I can't spend any more time on you.

286
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:31,784
Fight me.

287
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:32,952
I beg your pardon?

288
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,579
You heard me! Take me on, Caster!

289
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,427
Bones of my sword... unleash thy rage.

290
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,556
Caladbolg!

291
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,792
Why did you miss?

292
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:27,256
I can take up my sword
only when vowing a fatal blow.

293
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,883
To do so here is meaningless.

294
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:35,055
Then the two of you are much alike.

295
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:36,306
What?

296
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,351
You don't like profitless killing.

297
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:44,440
And that boy won't stand to see
innocent humans sacrificed.

298
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,316
You're the same.

299
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,278
Don't equate me to him!

300
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,657
Likewise. We are of vastly different nature.

301
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,328
It's a shame you're my enemy.

302
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,414
Join with me.

303
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:01,623
What?

304
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:07,546
I can provide you with much better
than your current partner.

305
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,882
Don't make me laugh!

306
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:13,719
I refuse. Your side lacks strength.

307
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,637
I've no reason to accept.

308
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:19,224
Then we've nothing more to discuss.

309
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:24,646
Correct. But since I'm the party-crasher here...

310
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,565
I've no reason to kill you, either.

311
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,233
You can go.

312
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,069
Say what?

313
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:34,907
Wait!

314
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,785
Why let her escape?

315
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:41,580
She's responsible for all the havoc in town!

316
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,290
Why stop her?

317
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,045
Caster sucked up human vitality...

318
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:51,340
...for the mana to defeat Berserker.

319
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,717
Let her do that.

320
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,095
Then we'll defeat her.

321
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:59,431
Well, I don't operate that way!

322
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,559
I won't allow people
to be sacrificed for those ends!

323
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,813
You can't save everybody.

324
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,983
Just accept it.

325
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:15,906
You can't save any life
unless you're willing to kill for it.

326
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,665
I'm warning you.

327
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,797
So be it.

328
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:45,310
It ends here for you Shiro Emiya.
The boy who wouldn't fight.

329
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:55,654
Shiro!

330
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,741
Saber...

331
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,998
Why didn't you strike me?

332
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:08,375
It would be artless...

333
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,752
...to pluck an ephemeral flower.

334
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,379
Go.

335
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:15,799
Another time, then.

336
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:20,012
Plan on interfering, samurai?

337
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:25,017
I was about to ask the same of you.

338
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,835
Release her!

339
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,010
Fuji!

340
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:10,562
You...

341
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,662
Noble Phantasm Rule Breaker.

342
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:31,416
A host of contracts nullified.
Betrayal and a wayward sword.

343
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,252
What did you do with Saber?!

344
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,879
Why, she's my familiar spirit now.

345
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,636
Start by killing that girl there.

346
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,231
No... stop.

347
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:55,774
Kill her.

348
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,529
No!

349
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,251
You dare resist a Command Spell?

350
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,631
Run... Shiro.

351
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,768
Saber.

352
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,305
Dammit.

353
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,563
This.

354
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,735
I remember it.

355
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:31,870
Aren't you growing tired of resisting
Command Spells?

356
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:55,852
Hmm. How unlucky for that girl
to have found us here.

357
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:40,230
So you murdered Kirei?

358
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:47,821
He didn't seem the type
to hand over the Grail willingly.

359
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,823
Is that...

360
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,456
...Mr. Kuzuki?

361
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:01,960
Did you check to see he was dead?

362
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,087
Why do you ask that?

363
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:07,716
Because I doubt he'd die so easily.

364
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:11,011
You're quite the pathetic woman.

365
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:15,098
Go rescue Saber. I'll handle the witch.

366
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:19,478
You understand that your sorcery's
no match for Caster.

367
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,938
I will defeat her.

368
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,275
Nice sentiment.

369
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:29,070
But stopping Caster in this place won't be easy.

370
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,200
After all, she killed her own brother
to save herself.

371
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,619
Why tell me this?

372
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:40,874
It is said the dragon's tooth resides in
the King of Colchis' magic.

373
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:45,504
His daughter, Queen Medea,
was considered a grand witch.

374
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,422
Correct.

375
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,967
Hence my advantage in this place.

376
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,472
Saber will soon fall completely under my will.

377
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:01,520
You can't break Saber
even with a Command Spell.

378
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,189
If only a heartbeat...

379
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,608
I'll have ample time to kill you.

380
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,026
Impossible.

381
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,404
I accept your earlier offer.

382
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,742
After declining once? How fickle you are.

383
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:21,540
Things have changed.
With Saber, victory leans your way.

384
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,416
What're you saying, Archer?

385
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,794
Use the contract breaker.

386
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,737
Shiro!

387
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:03,039
Trace on!

388
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,430
Wait.

389
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:22,142
I've one condition before joining you.

390
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:24,561
Condition? What now?

391
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,564
Allow them to escape this time.

392
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:32,652
They're hardly Magi now.
Killing them holds no value.

393
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:39,826
Fine. Go quickly in defeat.

394
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,663
Let's go.

395
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,967
For what it's worth...

396
00:43:57,177 --> 00:44:00,013
I made a mistake.

397
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:04,726
I should've defeated Caster earlier,
regardless of the means.

398
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:10,106
I can't fully blame Archer for switching sides.

399
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,903
That's where I went wrong.

400
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,447
No you didn't.

401
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,078
You may have failed. But you weren't wrong.

402
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,790
So lift your head high.

403
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,171
Shiro.

404
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:40,387
You sure surprised me.

405
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:44,432
You projected the same swords as Archer.

406
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,726
It surprised me, too.

407
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:51,606
I'd never projected a weapon before.
But his swords were different.

408
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:57,612
I skipped over all the thought processes,
and saw a clear image.

409
00:44:58,071 --> 00:45:01,116
As if it had been there all along.

410
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:11,418
We'll need a new game plan.

411
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,672
Oh yeah. I need to return this.

412
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,390
Yours, right?

413
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:29,853
I didn't realize until I saw one
with the same shape in your home.

414
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:46,202
Maybe we can get Illyasviel to help us.

415
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,997
What, are you nuts?

416
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:52,959
The Master of Berserker
would never ally with another.

417
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:57,672
We won't know until we try. There's a chance.

418
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:01,551
Forget it. You're way too trusting.

419
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:07,724
Archer might label clinging
to a tiny hope as sheer stupidity.

420
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:10,101
But we're different.

421
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:14,397
We can find hope in death-defying odds.

422
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,170
Berserker.

423
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:44,469
What's going on here?

424
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:04,322
Berserker!

425
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:09,536
Chains of Heaven!

426
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,882
Once you're bound in these chains...

427
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:26,094
...not even the gods themselves could escape!

428
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:50,910
Berserker!

429
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:13,016
Come little doll.

430
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:18,438
No! I don't want to!

431
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:36,456
No!!

432
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,469
Emiya?

433
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,221
A spectator?

434
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:55,516
I know I'm quite a sight to watch.

435
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:58,019
But you should know your place!

436
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,481
Wait.

437
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:08,613
How do you like my new Servant?

438
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,492
Beg for your life.

439
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:17,038
Maybe he'll spare you that at least.

440
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,916
No way!

441
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,712
You! Servant!

442
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:28,925
Move one finger and your Magus dies!

443
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,426
Tosaka!

444
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:36,307
You realize killing my Magus
won't stop me, don't you girl?

445
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,436
What're you doing?

446
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:46,234
Conditions have changed.
She'd make a good vessel.

447
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:52,573
Good to see you, Tosaka.

448
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,909
Glad you're still alive.

449
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,204
I'm sure you know Caster's building strength.

450
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:01,541
Ryudo Temple is to be the next altar.

451
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:05,211
Can't afford to lose any territory.

452
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:08,965
Why not forget about Emiya...

453
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,800
and join with us?

454
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,343
No thanks!

455
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:17,223
Join up to take orders from you? Don't be stupid.

456
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:21,811
For your information...

457
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:25,857
There's only one person who thinks
you have the talent to be a Magus.

458
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,900
And that's you.

459
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:32,697
Time's up. Can't let this heart spoil.

460
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:33,948
Wait!

461
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,993
Dammit! You'll be sorry!

462
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,344
Why'd you do it?

463
00:50:56,429 --> 00:51:00,767
You knew you'd be killed appearing before him.

464
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:03,436
Why'd you run out?

465
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,690
No reason.

466
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,943
I wanted to save her.

467
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:15,239
You confirmed the suspicions I had of you.

468
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:19,660
Your ideas are warped.

469
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,998
You value other people's lives
far above your own.

470
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:27,126
But you need to put yourself first.

471
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:31,130
You're always weighing down the scale
with the welfare of others.

472
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,508
But you are the scale!

473
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,889
And you're willing to destroy it
to save someone else.

474
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,349
Tosaka?

475
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:46,604
It's fine if you were just an
aimless person just simply living.

476
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:49,774
But you have a sense of self!

477
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:54,195
For one with so much conviction,
you sure are careless.

478
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:57,990
Keep that up and you'll surely break apart.

479
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:02,620
I do what I do so that I won't break apart.

480
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:06,374
No. You're already broken.

481
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:10,711
I don't know what happened. But tell me.

482
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:14,215
What is it that made you so crazy?

483
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,135
Back at school...

484
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:22,640
all those bodies didn't faze you.
You even said so yourself.

485
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:27,061
You've seen as much before.

486
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,730
It's true.

487
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:34,402
It wasn't the first time for me.

488
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:36,988
But you're wrong.

489
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:40,158
That fire ten years ago saved me.

490
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:43,661
It's not to blame for whatever you think it did.

491
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:48,583
I was saved, and that's all.

492
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,626
How so?

493
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:05,516
I had accepted death.

494
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:08,519
I expected it.

495
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:12,481
In that condition,
my body may have been saved.

496
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:15,234
But my spirit couldn't return.

497
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:18,237
In my emptiness...

498
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:21,782
I wondered if there was
something noble to live for.

499
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:29,040
I was the only survivor, you see.

500
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,002
In exchange for all who had died...

501
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:36,756
I must spend my life helping people.

502
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,260
All the more reason to value your own life!

503
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,346
If fortune spared just you...

504
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:46,182
you must respect that gift!

505
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:51,562
You have to heal all that pain
with your happiness!

506
00:53:57,401 --> 00:54:00,696
Thank you; you're right, Tosaka.

507
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:04,992
I know I've made mistakes. That's okay.

508
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:11,999
But wanting to live for others...
I know that's not wrong.

509
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,385
There's not supposed to be an eighth Servant.

510
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:25,429
He's obviously not one
of the chosen for this war.

511
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,516
And why partner with Shinji?

512
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:33,604
We must first focus on Caster.
She builds mana as we wait.

513
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:37,024
You're right.

514
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:41,195
You two will never win alone!

515
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:50,162
Lancer!

516
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,248
Wait. I'm not here to fight.

517
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:53,499
What?

518
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,961
You could use my help.

519
00:54:56,961 --> 00:55:01,090
Help? ls this your idea or...

520
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,092
Orders from my Magus.

521
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:07,888
Caster grows stronger. My Magus seeks allies.

522
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:12,476
Consider it a temporary alliance
to end once the job is done.

523
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:21,736
I'm in. How about you?

524
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:25,614
You expect us to trust you just like that?

525
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:29,910
I do. You have a fine woman as co-conspirator.

526
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,455
A fine woman helping you.

527
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,791
And you like to give people
the benefit of the doubt.

528
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:47,178
I should tell you about the pendant you gave me.

529
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,889
There's only one.

530
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:56,062
What you found in my room
is a pendant Archer returned to me.

531
00:55:56,395 --> 00:56:01,359
I thought he had just picked it up somewhere.

532
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,836
I was sure you'd come back.

533
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:29,011
You'll have to fight me first.

534
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:35,184
Didn't take you long to find a new Servant.

535
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,353
Go on ahead.

536
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:27,862
Tell me...

537
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:30,364
you really an archer?

538
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:35,035
You're good but...

539
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,205
But your swordsmanship.

540
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:42,001
It lacks pride.

541
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,589
Sorry to disappoint you. I don't have pride.

542
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:02,062
Gae Bolg!

543
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,981
Ro! Aias!

544
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,160
Impressive.

545
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:20,748
A spear that can pierce Aias.

546
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,168
What are you really?

547
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,086
Just an archer.

548
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,463
Liar!

549
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:30,883
With a shield that can block a Noble Phantasm?

550
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,552
Notice anything?

551
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:39,934
Caster appears to be in trouble.

552
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:49,151
So this was your plan all along.

553
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,831
Trace on!

554
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:06,020
Dearest Soichiro.

555
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:08,856
Caster...

556
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:39,762
Archer, I kind of suspected...

557
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:42,014
...but you didn't defect.

558
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,101
Saber!

559
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,231
Saber.

560
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:55,944
Shiro.

561
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,283
I missed.

562
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:05,704
What's that for?

563
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:15,422
I'm acting on my own now.

564
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:18,133
Still plan on killing Shiro?

565
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,346
Back off, Archer.

566
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:25,891
If you fight in your condition, Saber,
you might vanish.

567
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,478
I vowed to serve as his sword. I'd protect him.

568
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:34,233
Then you will disappear!

569
01:01:56,839 --> 01:01:58,257
Trace on.

570
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:02,553
That magic is too powerful for you.

571
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:06,807
The bill that has kept you alive thus far...

572
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:09,518
...gets paid in full now.

573
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,612
There's your limit.

574
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:22,197
Hear thee!

575
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:27,035
I command thee to my side.
Entrust my fate in thy sword.

576
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,079
Heeding to Holy Grail's refuge

577
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:31,999
If thou surrender to this will and reason...
Answer my call.

578
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:36,003
I embody Virtue in the Eternal World.

579
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,464
I chastise Evil in the Eternal World.

580
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:42,718
Thou art the Seven Heavens
harboring the great spirit trinity.

581
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,762
Come forth O Keeper of Balance!

582
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:46,180
Obey me!

583
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:49,391
And I will entrust this fate in your sword!

584
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:59,943
In the name of Saber, I accept the pledge.

585
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:03,822
I acknowledge you as my Magus... Rin!

586
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:24,051
Do you really think you can beat me now?

587
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:39,566
You used your Noble Phantasm.
Your mana is depleted.

588
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:42,820
Without even a Magus, what can you do?

589
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:48,325
An archer can exist for two days
without a master.

590
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:51,328
Plenty of time to kill him.

591
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:54,790
Why? Why pursue that conclusion?

592
01:03:55,415 --> 01:04:00,420
What you seek is wrong.
It is futile for you to persist.

593
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:03,841
You yourself cling to a mistaken goal.

594
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:15,185
Stop!

595
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:55,434
We're in his mindscape...a world of his making.

596
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:58,353
A Reality Marble.

597
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,148
This is a world only I can possess.

598
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:06,153
Here, I can replicate weapons at will.

599
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:09,406
That is my talent as an Epic Spirit.

600
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,910
Your world, you say?

601
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:19,458
I'll show you by duplicating your holy sword.

602
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,418
You know not its true form.

603
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:26,924
I don't have to. But I can come real close.

604
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,319
Shiro, no!

605
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:06,254
Is that all you got?

606
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,565
What're you doing?

607
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:28,986
Unhand me, you fool!

608
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:36,702
Where you going?

609
01:06:36,952 --> 01:06:39,663
Where we won't be bothered.

610
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:41,957
What about Rin?

611
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:43,667
An exchange.

612
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:47,129
That boy will have to pursue me.

613
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:50,090
What's more... Rin's your master.

614
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:56,013
Protect him if you will.
But it won't replace your master's life.

615
01:06:58,265 --> 01:07:02,102
He's going to Einzbern Castle.

616
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,980
No one will bother us there.

617
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,273
Shiro.

618
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:09,818
We'll hear your complaints.

619
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:13,947
But if you lay a finger on Tosaka...

620
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:18,910
I will kill you, Saber or no!

621
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,967
Is it finished, Boy?

622
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:37,012
Lancer!

623
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:41,058
Wait! He came to our aid.

624
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:45,270
Where's the girl?

625
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:49,316
Archer took her.

626
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:50,525
Say what?

627
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:03,371
Archer!

628
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:07,334
You insist on killing Shiro?

629
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:12,047
The sooner the better for a softie like him.

630
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:17,385
A softie he may be...

631
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:21,973
But that's his strength.

632
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,352
He has to be that way.

633
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:29,523
By accepting him, I feel somehow saved.

634
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:37,989
Well, Tosaka!

635
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:39,407
Shinji!

636
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,079
What's wrong, Archer?

637
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:47,499
Trembling at my Gilgamesh?

638
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,292
You want Rin?

639
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:54,131
Why else would anyone visit this moldy castle?

640
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:57,759
Then wait till I dispose of Shiro Emiya.

641
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:00,971
After that, she's all yours.

642
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,265
If you don't like it, tough.

643
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,519
What a quaint little clown. Move.

644
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:13,984
Take it easy. Archer will vanish soon, anyway.

645
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:16,111
Hmph, the fake.

646
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,127
You're late.

647
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,045
Where's Tosaka?!

648
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:39,301
You took so long, I gave her away to Shinji.

649
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:41,094
Easy.

650
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:46,057
My Master's ordered me not to let her die.

651
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:59,821
We had the exact same pendant.

652
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:06,828
But there was originally only one.

653
01:10:07,454 --> 01:10:12,334
I believe you've carried it
since your life was spared.

654
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:17,088
An heirloom of Tosaka's father.

655
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:21,760
So now I know your identity.

656
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,680
Epic Spirit Emiya.

657
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,892
That's your real name.

658
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:34,648
Shouldn't you embody
Shiro's ideal of Man turned Hero?

659
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,360
Then why seek to kill yourself?

660
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:42,948
I did become the Epic Spirit you idealized.

661
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:47,619
I rescued people... even saved the world once.

662
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:57,837
But all I was left with afterwards was regret.

663
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:01,466
And ghosts of the dead.

664
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:04,386
Ghosts?

665
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:07,889
To save as many humans as possible...

666
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:11,142
I killed, killed and killed again.

667
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,937
I slaughtered to fulfill my destiny.

668
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:19,776
And though I saved many times
more people than I killed...

669
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:24,239
I can't even begin to count the dead.

670
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:29,703
I can never exit this circle.

671
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:34,040
But for one exception.

672
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:37,544
You regret everything?

673
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:40,380
Of course...

674
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:43,925
In fact, you weren't
supposed to be an Epic Spirit.

675
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:48,847
That makes us different. I have no regrets!

676
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,683
I feel no sympathy for you!

677
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:54,811
By my own hand, I'll relieve you
of your corrupted principles!

678
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:57,105
Then you know.

679
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:01,985
Fighting me means a battle for the blade works!

680
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:19,336
Trace on.

681
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:31,723
Shinji!

682
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:37,771
Lancer!

683
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,564
Keep still.

684
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:42,233
That's far enough, Lancer.

685
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:43,735
What?

686
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:50,700
Kirei! You're alive!

687
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:54,954
You break your pledge
by showing yourself, Master.

688
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,374
You disobeyed, too.

689
01:12:57,749 --> 01:13:00,877
I told you to take care of Archer.

690
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:03,838
Don't worry. He'll self-destruct.

691
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:08,009
But that boy... is he your tool?

692
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:10,553
Don't second guess me.

693
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:17,602
To acquire the Grail, I formed
an alliance with them.

694
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:19,104
Charlatan priest!

695
01:13:19,104 --> 01:13:23,650
So you lied about wanting
to save your pupil. What now?

696
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:27,195
No, she served a valuable purpose.

697
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:36,621
So I gave her protection. That was paternal
enough. But I refuse to retire so easily.

698
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:39,165
Finish her.

699
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:43,795
If you wanted me to do it,
you could've used a Command Spell.

700
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:47,715
Then I order you now. Kill thyself, Lancer.

701
01:13:57,559 --> 01:13:59,018
Lancer!

702
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:05,567
Damn you, Kotomine!

703
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:19,581
Rin, you must go, too.

704
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:40,351
Lancer, you...!

705
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:43,813
If I knew I'd die like this...

706
01:14:44,022 --> 01:14:47,901
I wouldn't have become a hero!

707
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,886
Fools! Kill each other for all I care!

708
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:17,722
The Grail is yours, my ass!

709
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,945
Now the Grail...

710
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,867
...is all mine!

711
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:41,454
I'll share it with you if you're nice.

712
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:42,163
Stop!

713
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,624
Start pleading, Tosaka.

714
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:50,171
Don't you touch her.

715
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:52,382
Why aren't you dead?

716
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:54,717
Buzz off!

717
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:06,813
Lancer!

718
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:14,654
We must treat that wound!

719
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:18,825
A heart burst by Gae Bolg won't heal.

720
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:32,213
Go.

721
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:44,517
Farewell, Lancer.

722
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:49,856
I didn't know you long.
But I'd say you were my type.

723
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:52,734
Sorry, lassie.

724
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:57,196
Come back when you're older.

725
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:24,390
You think your swordsmanship is equal to mine?

726
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:28,895
You're still too green in the bones!

727
01:17:28,895 --> 01:17:30,688
Enough!

728
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:38,363
"I am...

729
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:40,114
"I am...
the bone of my sword."

730
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:43,660
"Steel is my body."

731
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,620
"Steel is my body."
"And fire is my blood."

732
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:50,917
"I fought over a thousand battles."

733
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:53,920
"I fought over a thousand battles."
"Never knowing loss."

734
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,631
"I fought over a thousand battles."
"Never knowing loss."
"But never understood."

735
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:00,927
"Always fighting alone."

736
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,470
"Always fighting alone."
"Poised atop a battlefield"

737
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,514
"Always fighting alone."
"Poised atop a battlefield"
"Drunk on victory."

738
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,853
"Ultimately, my life has no meaning."

739
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,647
"Ultimately, my life has no meaning."
"My whole body was...

740
01:18:13,398 --> 01:18:15,983
...Unlimited Blade Works."

741
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:23,533
So now you see the future that awaits you.

742
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:28,454
A lost creature imprisoned by futile ideals.

743
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:31,541
Do you now understand your true self?

744
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:40,883
Why you...!

745
01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:46,848
Do you really seek to be a hero?

746
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:50,810
Not "seek to be." Will be!

747
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,353
Well of course!

748
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:56,441
That's all you have!

749
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:57,942
Quiet!

750
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:00,695
A longing!

751
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:06,868
The joy on the face of the man who saved you.

752
01:19:06,993 --> 01:19:09,495
That's what you wish for!

753
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,956
Your ideals are not even your own!

754
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:13,291
No!

755
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:21,966
You've been ruled by an obsession
that you must help people!

756
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:25,553
It's become a pipe dream.
You just haven't noticed!

757
01:19:26,596 --> 01:19:30,099
You're living in a fairy tale.

758
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:35,480
If you can't live without that, then die dreaming!

759
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,781
My whole body was...

760
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:47,158
My whole body was unlimited blade works.

761
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:49,243
Still you persist.

762
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:51,746
I won't let you beat me.

763
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:54,624
I may lose to others...

764
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:57,376
...but I won't lose to myself!

765
01:19:58,252 --> 01:19:59,545
You...

766
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,717
I'm right!

767
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:11,849
You're too stupid to accept
that you're outmatched.

768
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:14,435
I'm not mistaken! Justice is on my side!

769
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:30,117
That was my mistake, too!

770
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:33,371
Well, it won't be mine!

771
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:45,675
Archer!

772
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:04,360
My victory, Archer.

773
01:21:05,695 --> 01:21:10,616
Yeah... and my loss.

774
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:22,879
No matter what obstacles lie ahead,
I'll have no regrets.

775
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:24,630
I'll overcome them!

776
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:29,427
That you must. Or it's all a lie.

777
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,556
Pretty entertaining.

778
01:21:33,848 --> 01:21:37,894
Two like-minded imitations
locked in a pathetic battle.

779
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:58,080
Now you see what real strength feels like.

780
01:21:58,289 --> 01:22:01,125
Imitations belong in the trash.

781
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,176
Archer!

782
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:14,555
You can beat him. I know you can.

783
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:28,277
How dare you take my Archer!

784
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:33,324
Stand back!

785
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:50,091
I'll get soiled by dust.

786
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,802
You got lucky, maggots.

787
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:54,679
Running away?

788
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:58,015
I must quickly complete the Grail.

789
01:22:58,015 --> 01:23:04,438
If I lose my master and the Grail bubbles over,
who knows what it may do?

790
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:15,533
He plans to complete the Grail at Ryudo Temple.

791
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:16,993
So we attack?

792
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:21,872
You hold Gilgamesh at the gate.
Shiro and I will enter from the rear.

793
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:25,209
No, Saber's at a disadvantage against him.

794
01:23:26,127 --> 01:23:27,586
How so?

795
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:30,381
His powers are too destructive.

796
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:33,384
He needs a foe with the same type of power.

797
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:35,344
Then who?

798
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,433
The same type of power?

799
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:41,600
His foe must be...

800
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:43,728
You, right?

801
01:23:44,562 --> 01:23:49,066
Your only hope is to use Archer's Reality Marble.

802
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:52,820
That requires immense magic.

803
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:58,075
A good sorcerer knows how
to borrow from elsewhere.

804
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:03,956
What I mean is...

805
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,043
Um...

806
01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:22,016
Can't be helped. You'll have to do.

807
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:35,654
You wanted the Grail, right?

808
01:24:41,035 --> 01:24:43,204
It's very, very valuable.

809
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:48,292
Don't let it go.

810
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:03,599
Transplant Rin's spell marks to me?
Is that possible?

811
01:25:03,808 --> 01:25:06,102
What other option is there?

812
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:12,358
If it works, I can feed you the power
to form a Reality Marble.

813
01:25:12,817 --> 01:25:15,861
Focus your energy and let's begin.

814
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:25,079
Hiyoku... rise. Control these marks.

815
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:28,249
No. 1, No. 16, stop.

816
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,792
Eng rave thy covenant.

817
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:35,214
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

818
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:41,137
innumerable, smaller, larger, larger, smaller...

819
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,848
Hiyoku... form!

820
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:32,146
Did it work?

821
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:35,858
Now it's all up to you.

822
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:38,986
Okay. Thank you, Tosaka.

823
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:40,654
Tosaka? What's wrong?

824
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:46,785
My memories... you saw them.

825
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:49,747
I... well...

826
01:26:51,207 --> 01:26:53,792
You jerk!

827
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:22,238
I waited for you, Saber.

828
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,240
Assassin.

829
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:27,743
Caster has disappeared.

830
01:27:28,369 --> 01:27:30,913
How can you still retain that form?

831
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:33,874
She may be a sorceress...

832
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:37,962
But a Servant has no control
over another Servant.

833
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:43,968
She summoned me and
chose this place for my dwelling.

834
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:48,764
I must remain here to defend this gate.

835
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:58,232
I shall not see the daybreak.

836
01:27:58,232 --> 01:28:02,278
But I am thankful for this final opportunity.

837
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:07,658
You mean, to fight me.

838
01:28:08,701 --> 01:28:11,245
This body must fall like petals.

839
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:17,543
If I can greet this end with you,
I'll have no better grave.

840
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:27,845
What is that?

841
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:34,351
Is that the Grail?

842
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,980
Not in its true form.

843
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,106
But it's about to burst.

844
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:48,615
Must I see your ugly faces again?

845
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:50,409
Gilgamesh!

846
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:51,702
Can't be.

847
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:55,039
Who's Saber fighting, then?

848
01:28:58,334 --> 01:29:01,003
That cocoon hatches.

849
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:08,761
I think the Grail would like
a bigger audience for its birth.

850
01:29:09,303 --> 01:29:13,640
Perhaps your lives will have meaning after all.

851
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:16,143
You can help bring it into the world.

852
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:19,521
Is that so? Well, I've got bad news!

853
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:22,107
We're spoiling this birthday party!

854
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:25,694
Woman, who gave you permission?

855
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:27,404
Trace on!

856
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:35,954
You...

857
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:08,987
Come on! Try to keep up!

858
01:30:18,622 --> 01:30:20,457
Divine Experience.

859
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,961
Blade work complete.

860
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:28,549
Full projection stand-by!

861
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:35,305
Oh? So you can replicate my
Noble Phantasms on sight, huh?

862
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:37,391
Well, then allow me to...

863
01:30:39,143 --> 01:30:40,644
Cease and melt!

864
01:30:40,644 --> 01:30:42,020
...give you a grade!

865
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:46,316
Full Projection Sword Barrel!

866
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,501
Hiken!

867
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:10,549
Tsubame-gaeshi!

868
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:25,731
Go.

869
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:38,202
A beautiful little bird...

870
01:31:38,577 --> 01:31:42,748
that fights like a lion.

871
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:50,672
I would've been better matched by Archer.

872
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:55,052
At least he didn't live by borrowed principles.

873
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:59,598
That's what he said about you, wasn't it?

874
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:01,850
Yes, he did.

875
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,188
Beyond the dream lies disillusionment, he said.

876
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:11,360
And yet he pursued it,
anyway with relentless abandon.

877
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:15,155
As someone with unattainable ideals...

878
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:17,741
I admire that noble devotion!

879
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:27,251
Who cares if the dream is borrowed
if I'm willing to fight for it?!

880
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:28,293
To the end!

881
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:33,131
You're pretty persistent.
I thought you'd be dead by now.

882
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,841
Now disappear!

883
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,303
Get back, Shiro!

884
01:32:43,267 --> 01:32:44,434
I'll take him.

885
01:32:44,434 --> 01:32:47,187
No, I can handle him alone, Saber!

886
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:48,230
Shiro!

887
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:51,817
Help Tosaka stop the Grail.

888
01:32:57,197 --> 01:32:58,323
Good luck.

889
01:32:59,408 --> 01:33:01,368
Are you nuts?

890
01:33:01,994 --> 01:33:06,540
Refusing the help of your Servant?

891
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:12,212
I realized my trade isn't actually sword-making.

892
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:15,882
It's harnessing the power of my mind!

893
01:33:22,431 --> 01:33:23,724
What?

894
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,685
What I make...

895
01:33:27,978 --> 01:33:29,646
are whole worlds...

896
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:32,274
of swords...

897
01:33:33,275 --> 01:33:35,319
in limitless quantity.

898
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,155
I call it...

899
01:33:42,993 --> 01:33:46,288
"Unlimited Blade Works!"

900
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:55,172
A magic circuit?

901
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:57,299
These are all imitations.

902
01:33:57,466 --> 01:33:59,885
As you said, trivial to you.

903
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:04,514
But who says imitations
can't cut like the real thing?

904
01:34:05,015 --> 01:34:08,852
Come on, Hero King! I'm fully armed!

905
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:12,397
Don't get cocky, mongrel!

906
01:34:18,195 --> 01:34:19,488
Rin!

907
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:22,115
No! Don't touch that magma!

908
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:24,284
But...

909
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:28,121
It's gonna burst. Shred it with a Noble Phantasm!

910
01:34:28,288 --> 01:34:31,875
Get out of there quickly! Leave the rest to me!

911
01:34:38,799 --> 01:34:40,926
Damn... we're trapped.

912
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:44,638
Sorry, Shinji.

913
01:34:44,638 --> 01:34:46,264
Just go.

914
01:34:46,682 --> 01:34:49,476
I don't want to hear your whimpering.

915
01:35:09,746 --> 01:35:11,790
Saber! Do it now!

916
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:19,965
Ex...

917
01:35:22,175 --> 01:35:24,845
...caliber!

918
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:43,989
Saber!

919
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:08,388
It can't be!

920
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:12,642
Disappeared, huh? Pathetic girl.

921
01:36:19,483 --> 01:36:22,110
You bastard!

922
01:36:22,986 --> 01:36:25,530
Give it your best shot, boy!

923
01:36:45,926 --> 01:36:46,885
Impossible...!

924
01:36:52,933 --> 01:36:54,434
How can I...

925
01:36:58,104 --> 01:37:01,441
...lose to an imposter!

926
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:07,906
Take that!

927
01:37:22,546 --> 01:37:25,215
No you don't!

928
01:37:44,234 --> 01:37:45,861
What the...?

929
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:19,644
I thought you needed to feed on
a magician to complete yourself.

930
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:23,315
I'm a Servant! What are you taking me for?

931
01:38:31,281 --> 01:38:33,241
Duck to your right.

932
01:38:37,746 --> 01:38:42,167
You... bastard...

933
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:47,714
ARCHER!

934
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:14,157
Archer!

935
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:19,746
Archer.

936
01:39:20,246 --> 01:39:22,749
Be my Servant again.

937
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:29,130
I'm sorry. I don't have that right.

938
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:32,300
What's more... I'm done here.

939
01:39:33,093 --> 01:39:35,178
My battle is finished.

940
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:39,808
But then... you'll forever be...

941
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:46,648
All right, look. I leave this world with no regrets.

942
01:39:46,856 --> 01:39:52,028
But watch over "me," Rin.
I mean, the guy's helpless, right?

943
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:54,614
Archer.

944
01:40:02,122 --> 01:40:06,001
Okay, I will. I'll do my best.

945
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:10,422
I'll help him learn to value himself.

946
01:40:11,923 --> 01:40:14,175
So you do the same.

947
01:40:15,677 --> 01:40:17,679
I've got my answer.

948
01:40:18,263 --> 01:40:22,892
Don't worry, Tosaka. I won't let you down.

949
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:33,153
Darn it...

950
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:37,866
he didn't give me a chance to complain.

951
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:57,802
Sometimes, I remember...
the clunky clang of metal.

952
01:41:00,055 --> 01:41:04,726
A blinding, obstinate duel in the distance.

953
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:10,899
A clash of deep convictions.

954
01:41:13,443 --> 01:41:19,824
By forcing my aspirations,
I only wound up confronting myself.

955
01:41:21,951 --> 01:41:24,370
I don't have the answer yet.

956
01:41:24,829 --> 01:41:29,292
That probably won't come for a very long time.

957
01:41:57,153 --> 01:42:02,909
Kizutsuku koto bakari no hibi ni

981
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:52,745
There is nothing left to say

982
01:44:53,538 --> 01:45:00,336
The boy remains, while He departs

983
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:05,717
Leaving only the memory of clashing swords

984
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:11,222
Along a distant path... a faint echo as a guide...

985
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:25,862
A young man heads toward the wilderness

986
