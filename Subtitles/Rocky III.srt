1
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,220
It's blind instinct!

2
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,030
But now it is Creed coming back.

3
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,050
Creed with a left hand! What's keeping these two guys up?

4
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,190
A tremendous closing moment!

5
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,190
Here comes Balboa back, but the champion back with another left!

6
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,030
How did they getting out here, I don't know!

7
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,000
A right hand!

8
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,030
It's Creed! Now it's Balboa! Now it's Creed!

9
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,990
And now a tremendous left by Balboa!

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,180
They're standing dead in the center of the ring, toe-to-toe!

11
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,080
One.

12
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,000
Two.

13
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,040
Creed will retain the title! If neither gets up

14
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,000
it's a draw, and Creed will win the title!

15
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,040
Four.

16
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,010
Get up! Five.

17
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,000
Six.

18
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,050
Each trying to beat the count!

19
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,010
Get up!

20
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,070
Eight. He's trembling!

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Nine.

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,050
The champ is down! Ten.

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
You're out!

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,030
He won!

25
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,050
He's done it at the last second!

26
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,080
Balboa got on his feet and he made it! Rocky Balboa has shocked the world!

27
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,010
He is the new heavyweight champion of the world!

28
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,040
Ladies and gentlemen,

29
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,060
in a stunning upset...

30
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,990
scoring a win by a knockout...

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,230
the new heavyweight champion of the world...

32
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,240
You were great. Rocky Balboa!

33
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,000
Excuse me. Excuse me.

34
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:45,180
I just wanna say one thing to my wife, who's home.

35
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,090
Yo, Adrian! I did it!

36
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,040
I love you. I love you.

37
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,040
Come on, come on! Bring it to me!

38
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,070
Come back! Come on!

39
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,070
It's the Muppet Show!

40
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,220
Tonight, Rocky Balboa!

41
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,030
I want Balboa! I want Balboa!

42
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,060
Hear that, old man? You tell Balboa to come here if he wants!

43
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,010
Nobody can beat me! You tell him what I said!

44
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,010
And he's next! I'm gonna kill him!

45
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,040
Nobody can stop me! You tell Balboa that!

46
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,060
I'm coming after him! You tell him!

47
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,050
I want a shot at the title.

48
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,050
If Balboa's got the guts, he'll meet me in the ring or anywhere else.

49
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,080
My whole life was directed towards this here title, and nothing else.

50
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,070
I live alone and I train alone.

51
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll win the title alone. I want him.

52
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,070
He can't duck me forever. He can run, but he can't hide.

53
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,060
Well, another southpaw...

54
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,030
heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa, doesn't seem to be worried about much.

55
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,070
He's just defended his title for the tenth time.

56
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,020
He's even agreed to take on the world's heavyweight wrestling champion...

57
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,060
in a sort of charity benefit...

58
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,040
with all the proceeds to go to a local youth foundation.

59
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,040
Now, I'll have to give him credit.

60
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,080
Mr. Balboa manages to stay busy. He's a true sportsman.

61
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,050
And it looks like the number-one contender Clubber Lang...

62
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,060
will have to continue to play the waiting game.

63
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,010
But that should be a great, great matchup.

64
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,050
Take it easy, okay?

65
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,030
Hey, you going ?

66
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,030
Don't forget to give Rocky my best, huh?

67
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,040
You know, I've been coming here years.

68
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,040
How about you give me, Paulie, your best once?

69
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,010
Take it easy, Paulie.

70
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,080
Paulie, you hear me?

71
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,220
When you see the Rock, tell him the boys all say "hey"!

72
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,050
Forty thousand!

73
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,050
I got another one!

74
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,090
Paulie.

75
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,290
You wanna hear "I owe ya"? You I owe nothing .

76
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,010
No, you don't owe me nothing .

77
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,040
So what do you want I should do?

78
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,030
My sister ain't here? She's home.

79
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,070
Well, me and her used to be tight until you come in.

80
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,040
I raised her, she don't come down.

81
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,070
She don't know about this.

82
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
You can up and go to hell, you know that?

83
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,030
Hey, watch your mouth, Paulie.

84
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,060
You gonna whack me? I don't sweat you.

85
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,020
I don't sweat you. Come on.

86
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,080
Come on, Paulie. Why don't you screw your head on right?

87
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,060
No, it ain't my head. Your freaking head is the one on wrong.

88
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,070
Yeah?

89
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, what did I do? What'd you do?

90
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,990
Nothing . For yourself? Oh, nice.

91
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,010
You fixed your face up handsome, nice clothes.

92
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,580
What'd you do for Paulie? Anything?

93
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,000
Three years? Did you get me a job?

94
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:51,060
Just this. You gave me a lousy, stinking Ex-Lax watch. This!

95
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,050
PaulieWhat? What? There!

96
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,040
That's right! No, leave it down!

97
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,080
It never kept good time anyway.

98
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,990
You forget when you were a punk and those guys used to laugh at ya...

99
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
because you were so jive. Who used to whack them bums out?

100
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,070
They laughed at both of us.

101
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,080
No one laughed at me.

102
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,080
Tell me, who fixed ya up with your first woman?

103
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,050
Me, Paulie! I was responsible!

104
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,010
She was pregnant.

105
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,990
So what? You was no prize either.

106
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,060
You know, I always give ya. I give ya.

107
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,060
What do you do? You buy a new house.

108
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,050
You move Mick in, right?

109
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,010
Did you ask me? Is there something the matter with me?

110
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,990
I got feeling s, you know. This ain't cardboard.

111
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,050
Everybody's got 'em, Paulie.

112
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,020
To hell with everybody.

113
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,000
No, Maybe it's to hell with you.

114
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,380
I don't wanna listen to this crap.

115
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,560
You talk like everybody owes you a living .

116
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,360
Shut your mouth.

117
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,990
Nobody owes nobody nothing . You owe yourself.

118
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,060
You're wrong! Friends owe!

119
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,010
Friends don't owe! They do because they wanna do.

120
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,060
Shut your freaking mouth. You been keeping me down!

121
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,020
Down?

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,850
You know, you're like a crazy brother to me.

123
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,670
You really are. So I'm gonna tell you something .

124
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,050
This is coming straight from the heart, Paulie,

125
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,070
and I mean this.

126
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,990
You ain't down, and you ain't a loser.

127
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,070
You're just a jealous...

128
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,090
lazy bum.

129
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,050
Okay. I'm gonna break your mouth.

130
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,460
I'm gonna break your mouth!

131
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,060
Can I have a job?

132
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,160
All you had to do was ask.

133
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,030
You punch pretty good.

134
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,070
Think so? Oh, superb.

135
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,030
Cost a lot, huh? Yeah, a few bucks.

136
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,090
Got an extra one?

137
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,070
Any trouble with Paulie tonight?

138
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,040
No, nothing unusual.

139
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,990
Are you really gonna fight that wrestler? They're so big.

140
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,990
That's all right. It'll be fun.

141
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,200
You mind if I serenade you?

142
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,990
Come on. It's your part.

143
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,050
What are you doing ?

144
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,230
Come on. You can do it. No.

145
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,050
Rocky, you're gonna wake the baby.

146
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:26,240
Adrian, let's do a duet.

147
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,000
No, hold on a minute.

148
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:34,030
That's good, but it's not "doe-doe's. "

149
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,070
doe-doe's, doe-doe's

150
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,020
That's good.

151
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,060
I've been told

152
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,010
doe-doe's

153
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,070
By people And they all,

154
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,080
doe-doe's

155
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
Said you'd take me back

156
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,230
Take me back like before

157
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,070
What's the matter?

158
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,060
I don't know any more of the composition.

159
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,070
Maybe we're lucky.

160
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:06,170
Yeah, we're very lucky. Very lucky.

161
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,070
Howdy, sports fans.

162
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,380
This is Dennis James with Jim Healy down here at ringside.

163
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,090
Tonight we have a most unlikely match for you

164
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,030
the boxer against the wrestler

165
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,050
with all the proceeds going to charity.

166
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,080
What are your feelings about a boxer against a wrestler in the same ring?

167
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,070
Well, you know, the age-old theory is...

168
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,000
that the wrestler, once he grabs that boxer, that's all she wrote.

169
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,040
What the hell goes on inside your head?

170
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,010
Anything normal functions?

171
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,040
Yeah, there's a few.

172
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,030
I don't think so. Because to fight a creature like this...

173
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,990
you gotta have about 100 pounds of brain damage.

174
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,110
I seen wrestlers that was bigger than dinosaurs.

175
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,060
You ever fight a dinosaur, kid?

176
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,010
No, not lately. They can cause a variety of damage.

177
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,020
The wrestling champion of the world is now entering the arena...

178
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,060
and he is quite a sight-all decked out in red.

179
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,020
Why are they carrying him?

180
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,090
He's walking .

181
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm coming after you, Balboa.

182
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,030
Let's call it off.

183
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,000
Come on. It's for charity.

184
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,060
You're wearing your anatomy out for charity. Nobody else does this much for charity.

185
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,010
Bob Hope would.

186
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,050
That's true.

187
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,230
Rocky, you better call Bob Hope.

188
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,050
To all my love slaves out there...

189
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,080
Thunderlips is here, in the flesh, baby.

190
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,010
Oh, my God.

191
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,040
The ultimate male versus...

192
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,030
the ultimate meatball.

193
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,030
Boy, he is a monster.

194
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,040
How much would you take even to get in the ring with him?

195
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,030
Would you like to start at Fort Knox?

196
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,990
In the white corner, an incredible sight...

197
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,030
standing nearly seven feet...

198
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,040
weighing 390 pounds...

199
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,050
the undisputed...

200
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,240
wrestling champion of the world.... That's the biggest arm in the world!

201
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,080
a man who calls himself the ultimate object of desire...

202
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,050
the mountain of molten lust...

203
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,050
the one, the only...

204
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,070
Thunderlips!

205
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,040
You're all trash!

206
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,020
You're all trash!

207
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,170
In the far corner, the slugger from Philadelphia...

208
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,010
You better shut up!

209
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,030
I'll break him in half!

210
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,080
How much do you think he eats?

211
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,020
About 202 pounds.

212
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,050
weighing 202 pounds...

213
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,010
the reigning heavyweight champion of the world...

214
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,010
Rocky Balboa!

215
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,040
Come to the center of the ring, please.

216
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,030
Okay, come on, Mick.

217
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,040
All right, you guys, you know this is for fun...

218
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,240
so take it easy and give 'em a good show.

219
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,890
Listen, after the match, how about we get a Polaroid together, okay?

220
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,040
You're in trouble.

221
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,080
I'm gonna break him in half like this!

222
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,050
Seems like lately, everybody wants to beat me up.

223
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,020
This is entertainment. I'll squash Balboa!

224
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,060
Stay awake! Make faces! Move around the ring!

225
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,150
Got it? He is the ring.

226
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,220
I get nervous every time he does that.

227
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,020
Whoa. You move pretty fast for a big guy, you know that?

228
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,060
Listen, why don't we just move around a little bit, like give 'em a good show.

229
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,080
First I'll chase you, then you chase me, okay?

230
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,050
How's that? All right? We'll go easy.

231
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,020
Is that okay? Does that hurt? Stay away from him!

232
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,080
That hurt, all right?

233
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,220
How's that? Okay? Not bad, huh?

234
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,240
Come on, meatball! Come on!

235
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,990
Think it's all fake, meatball? All fake?

236
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,520
Thunderlips has gone absolutely berserk.

237
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,020
Run for your life!

238
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,050
Last stop, meatball!

239
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:55,160
Get up, boy! Come on, meatball! Get some of this right here!

240
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,230
Rocko, remember the neighborhood!

241
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,000
Get out of his way!

242
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,990
No, I'm not yet, not for the meatball.

243
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,020
I'm not done with him yet, boy.

244
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:13,220
If I can't break your spirit, I sure enough can break your back!

245
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,060
Is Daddy having fun?

246
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,020
Of course.

247
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Get up!

248
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,200
Somebody lend me a hatchet!

249
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,050
Holy smoke!

250
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:33,210
Here we go, baby! Lights out, meatball!

251
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,050
Oh, my God! Balboa is really in pain!

252
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,050
No one can believe the superhuman strength of Thunderlips!

253
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,030
I am Thunderlips, I am the man!

254
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,060
Stop him, will ya?

255
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,050
You want this punching bag?

256
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,050
Adrian?

257
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,070
Rocky

258
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,030
Catch me!

259
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,070
That's incredible!

260
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,990
Balboa was just heaved clear into the fifth row!

261
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,040
Now the fans are outraged too.

262
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm gonna drag him down the aisle like a dirty rag!

263
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,040
You weakling, Balboa!

264
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,050
Take it easy!

265
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,010
Mickey, you okay? My heart.

266
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,060
Now the security guards are rushing in, trying to stop this slaughter.

267
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,040
Teeth are flying all around!

268
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,070
Cut my gloves off! Why? You finished?

269
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,190
Come on! Cut my gloves off!

270
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,050
A security guard flying through the air! The place is a zoo!

271
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,030
This place has turned into a zoo! This is very, very

272
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,990
Want me to get a doctor? You sure?

273
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,620
The girls have gotten into it now. They're getting beat up.

274
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,020
Where are you going, you fool?

275
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,020
I'll be right back. You're a maniac! Come back here!

276
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,070
What are you doing?

277
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,010
Come back here!

278
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,050
Hey, come on!

279
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,190
Out of the way, worms! Come on!

280
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,090
Come on! Come on!

281
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,080
All right, Thunderlips, break it up! Break it up!

282
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,010
No choking! No choking!

283
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,090
I don't sweat you!

284
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,180
Hang on! Hang on there, kid!

285
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,010
How do you like it, huh?

286
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,030
You're kinda cute.

287
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,080
I don't need this.

288
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,030
Rocky is out-and-out strangling him.

289
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:42,150
Rocky hanging on like a bull terrier. Now he's got him in a stranglehold.

290
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,020
The body!

291
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,000
Knock his block off!

292
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,090
Timber! No!

293
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,010
It's unbelievable! Rocky actually did it!

294
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,070
A human skyscraper's been thrown out of the ring!

295
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,200
All right, that's it. Time is up.

296
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,240
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a draw. A draw.

297
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:33,020
Thank you, one and all, for attending the 12th annual charity match

298
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,000
between the Italian Stallion Rocky Balboa...

299
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,010
and Thunderlips, the ultimate male.

300
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,050
See you next year. Thank God.

301
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,000
Are you all right? Yeah, pretty good.

302
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,010
Good match.

303
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,080
Why'd you get so crazy on me out there?

304
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,080
That's the name of the game.

305
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:52,060
While you're still calm, can we get that Polaroid together?

306
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,070
Yeah, sure.

307
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,990
Adrian, come on over here. My wife Adrian, my kid.

308
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,990
That's Thunderlips. Al, would you do that?

309
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,050
That hurt. Okay, that's all right.

310
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,150
You know, sometimes charity really hurts.

311
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,990
Pinocchio told a lie, and his nose started growing real big.

312
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,050
Why didn't his ears grow?

313
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,990
I don't know. I didn't write the story.

314
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,030
Are you fighting again?

315
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,020
Today? No, I don't plan on fighting today.

316
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,030
Promise? Promise. Definitely I promise.

317
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,070
Good. I like you here.

318
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,210
Yeah? I like being here. Are you getting hungry, huh?

319
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,050
You want some Wheaties?

320
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,050
What are Wheaties, huh? Champions.

321
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,070
Breakfast of what? Champions. Champions.

322
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,000
And the father bear, he says, "Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "

323
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,000
And the little kid bear said "Somebody's been sleeping in my bed,"

324
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,000
"and there she is. "

325
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,040
Thereby he pulls back the covers...

326
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:53,000
and thereby exposing her to the, you know, public, see?

327
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,000
Come on, eat your cereal before it sinks.

328
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,750
Then what happened to Goldilocks?

329
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,000
What happened to her? I'm not exactly sure.

330
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,580
Busted for trespassing and got 30 days in the clink.

331
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,040
That's real nice, Paulie. That's nice to tell the kid.

332
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,000
Rocky, the car is waiting.

333
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,010
You guys better go.

334
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:14,020
Be a good boy now. We'll have a fun time, me and the kid.

335
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,010
Oh, Mrs. Stallion, you almost look pretty good.

336
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,040
Oh, thank you, Paulie.

337
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,030
Don't give the kid any beer, all right?

338
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,000
Okay, we gotta go. And Paulie, don't take him to the track, all right?

339
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,040
How ya doing , Mick?

340
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,000
Pretty good.

341
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,220
Now, we got a problem in the seventh.

342
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:57,200
Whatever happened to them quiet, tender moments, huh?

343
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,080
Thank you. Thank you, one and all.

344
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:20,080
Every once in a while, a person comes along who defies the odds...

345
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,070
who defies logic...

346
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:26,080
and fulfills an incredible dream.

347
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,010
On behalf of all the citizens of Philadelphia...

348
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,990
and the many who have been touched by your accomplishments...

349
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,010
and your untiring participation in this city's many charity functions...

350
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:42,000
it is with tremendous honor that we present this memorial...

351
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,040
which will stand always as a celebration...

352
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,030
to the indomitable spirit of man.

353
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,220
Philadelphia salutes its favorite son Rocky Balboa!

354
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,080
It's beautiful.

355
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,200
Definitely a thing of beauty.

356
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,020
Thank you.

357
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,010
Thank you very much.

358
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:41,190
I don't know what, what do you say to something like this?

359
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,000
About three years ago...

360
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,070
this city...

361
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,150
really took me inside, you know?

362
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:59,010
And I want to thank you very much for that. I really do.

363
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,010
And I've been thinking that I wasn't gonna bring this up,

364
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
but I might as well now.

365
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,030
I would never do anything to to hurt this sport

366
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,040
that has been so really good to me.

367
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,070
And I've been talking it over with my wife...

368
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,090
and my manager...

369
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,070
and we think that

370
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:27,040
Well, it's really hard to I feel like, well

371
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:31,020
I'm thinking maybe it's time that I should...

372
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:37,160
step down maybe and retire.

373
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,050
No! No!

374
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,030
Getting out while you can?

375
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,000
Don't give this sucker no statue. Give him guts!

376
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,080
I told you I wasn't going away.

377
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,060
You got your shot. Now give me mine.

378
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,030
Get the hell outta here!

379
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,030
Shut up, old man! I ain't going nowhere.

380
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,070
Now why don't you tell all these nice folks why you been ducking me?

381
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,060
Politics, man. This country wants to keep me down,

382
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,060
keep everybody weak.

383
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,020
They don't want me to have the title because I'm not a puppet like that fool.

384
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,230
You know, you've got a big mouth.

385
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,060
Why don't you come out and close it, Balboa? Come on!

386
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,090
Anytime.

387
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,990
The guy's crazy. Don't listen to him.

388
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,430
The little man don't wanna come to me. I'll come to you and tell the truth.

389
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,420
I am ranked number one. One!

390
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,460
That means I'm the best.

391
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,370
But this bum is taking the easy matches, fighting other bums.

392
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm telling you and everybody here...

393
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,230
I'll fight him anywhere, anytime, for nothing .

394
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:33,010
But you people ain't never gonna see that happen because he's gonna retire.

395
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,340
You see, he don't fight no real man.

396
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,030
He fight them setups. What?

397
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,020
You're a disgrace to this sport!

398
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:42,020
Shut up, old man! You and that chump don't know where I had to come from.

399
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,020
Balboa, your family doing real nice, ain't it?

400
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,350
You call yourself a fighter. Prove it now.

401
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,020
Give me the same chance.

402
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,030
The way you been ducking this is a disgrace.

403
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,000
If he ain't no coward, why don't he fight me then?

404
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,020
I can't listen to any more of this. I don't care what you're ranked.

405
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,460
You don't get no shot, and I mean that!

406
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,410
I'm glad you're seeing this.

407
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,860
I wanna fight this guy.

408
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,310
Well, you've got him.

409
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,000
But you fight him without me.

410
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,070
What are you saying ? It's finished.

411
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,020
Yes, I'm finished. I don't want no more of this.

412
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,080
I don't want no more of it. You understand? None of it!

413
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,920
It's all over with! Judge me by my fighting record.

414
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,010
Hey, woman. Hey, woman. Listen here.

415
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:24,000
Since your man ain't got no heart, maybe you'd like to see a real man.

416
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,240
I bet you stay up late every night dreaming you had a real man, don't you?

417
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,040
I'll tell you what.

418
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,360
Bring yourself over to my apartment tonight, and I'll show you a real man.

419
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,230
You want it, you got it!

420
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,020
Anytime!

421
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,470
Rocky, don't. Come on.

422
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,990
Rocky, please, let's go talk.

423
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,020
Rocky

424
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,040
Rocky. Let's talk.

425
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,050
Why'd you leave?

426
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,010
Why'd you walk away like that?

427
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,000
Life's too short, kid.

428
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,010
Where are you going ?

429
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,080
I'm going on a permanent vacation.

430
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,060
What are you talking about? We got one more fight.

431
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,030
No, not we. You.

432
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,020
Why are you doing this?

433
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,060
I said, why are you doing this?

434
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,080
Because you can't win, Rock!

435
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:32,010
This guy'll kill you to death inside of three rounds!

436
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,010
You're crazy.

437
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,050
What else is new?

438
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,990
He's just another fighter.

439
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,070
No, he ain't just another fighter.

440
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,050
This guy is a wrecking machine, and he's hungry.

441
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,020
Hell, you ain't been hungry since you won that belt.

442
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,370
What are you talking about? I've had ten title defenses.

443
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,460
That was easy.

444
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,490
What do you mean, easy?

445
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,050
They was handpicked!

446
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,670
Setups? No, they weren't setups.

447
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,060
They was good fighters, but they wasn't killers like this guy.

448
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,190
He'll knock you into tomorrow, Rock.

449
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,090
Geez, Mick.

450
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,040
Why'd you do it?

451
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,990
Because the beating that you got from Apollo should've killed you, kid.

452
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,990
It didn't. It was my job to keep you winning

453
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and to keep you healthy.

454
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,020
You really don't think I got nothing left, do you?

455
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,030
Well, Rock,

456
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,040
Well, let's put it this way.

457
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:01,170
Now, three years ago, you was supernatural.

458
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,990
You was hard and you was nasty...

459
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,010
and you had this cast-iron jaw.

460
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,010
But then the worst thing happened to you...

461
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,050
that could happen to any fighter.

462
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,050
You got civilized. Yeah

463
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,030
Oh, don't worry, kid.

464
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:31,340
You know, presidents retire, generals retire, horses retire,

465
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,010
Man O'War retired.

466
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,070
They put him out to stud.

467
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,220
That's what you should've done, retire.

468
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,030
I can't retire knowing all this, Mick.

469
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Oh, don't push it. Well, you been carrying me.

470
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,070
We don't need it.

471
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,080
You've been carrying me though.

472
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,370
I haven't been carrying ya. I been protecting ya.

473
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,990
No, it's not the way, I want this fight, just one more.

474
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But we don't need it. I'll live in the gym.

475
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:08,000
We don't need it. Mick, I do.

476
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,030
And I'm asking you to train me one last time.

477
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,010
Oh, no, I can't.

478
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,040
If you don't...

479
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,210
I'll tell everybody you ain't bought a new pair of underwear in ten years.

480
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,990
You would, wouldn't you?

481
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,030
Yeah, absolutely.

482
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,010
No, no.

483
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,070
Come on.

484
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,020
One more time, then it's over.

485
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,030
It's a deal? Come on.

486
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:40,210
It's your head, kid. It's your head.

487
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,080
Yeah, it is.

488
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,060
Thanks, Mick.

489
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,180
Hot off the truck. Clean stuff. Get your robes.

490
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,990
Collectors' item! Once in a lifetime!

491
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,730
Get your buttons here!

492
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,060
You can't stand toe-to-toe with this guy.

493
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,000
or he'll deposit you up there on Mars someplace.

494
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,010
He's too tough. He's too strong.

495
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,460
Listen. Now how the hell can we train in this creep joint here?

496
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,140
I mean, this is kind of a house of ill repute or something , isn't it?

497
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,010
Why did you rent this joint?

498
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,060
Oh, come on, Mickey. Let's go out in style, okay?

499
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,010
You wanna go out in style, go out in one piece!

500
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,370
Now let's get outta here.

501
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,070
Let's get back to the old gym, will ya?

502
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,070
Let's get some blood and sweat and tears around here.

503
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:17,210
Can we do that? Just relax and enjoy it.

504
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,050
They love it, Mick.

505
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,030
Go fight! Fight now. Go ahead.

506
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,010
Fight it, fight it. Get rough, get tough.

507
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,070
Get brutal. That's it.

508
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,020
Excuse me. Could I get a kiss?

509
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,030
Yeah, sure.

510
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,010
Get outta here, will ya?

511
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,370
It's like fighting in a zoo. It's a zoo, you know?

512
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,350
Is that the way you train for Clubber?

513
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,030
He ain't gonna kiss ya. He's gonna kill ya. You know that?

514
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,050
Get outta here!

515
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,050
Yo, Rock! How about a picture?

516
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,080
Yeah, sure. There ya go.

517
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,010
Put a little speed on there!

518
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,170
Put a little speed on there! That a boy.

519
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,070
All right, this'll tell us the story.

520
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,000
Fast! Side to side.

521
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,960
Side to side, Rock!

522
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,050
Shut up back there, can't you? Change your tune.

523
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,630
That's it! Punch, punch, punch!

524
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,680
That's it, kid. You're a deadly weapon.

525
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,010
Time, time, time. Quit it.

526
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,000
You're okay. Come on.

527
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,770
Put this on before you catch pneumonia. Okay.

528
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,760
I'll give you a little rubdown too. Yeah.

529
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,450
Hey, listen, kid.

530
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,050
I don't like to hear much of what comes out of people's mouths.

531
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,020
And I don't like soft-talking moments.

532
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,580
That's for sure. But I just wanted to tell you one thing.

533
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,050
I'm proud of you.

534
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,030
Well, thanks a lot. That's all right, kid.

535
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,010
Let's get outta here. Hey, Mick?

536
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,020
Yeah?

537
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,010
What'll we do when it's all over? I don't know.

538
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,080
Maybe join up with a circus.

539
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:51,230
Yeah, maybe. All right, let's go.

540
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,080
Rocky

541
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,060
Good evening, everyone. Along with Bill Baldwin

542
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,020
I'm Stu Nahan,

543
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,060
and we welcome you to tonight's heavyweight title fight...

544
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,990
which may prove to be the most memorable of all.

545
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,020
For tonight is the champion's final and perhaps most difficult title defense.

546
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,330
Rocky, do you feel you're in the best shape of your career?

547
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,320
Oh, yeah, absolutely. I feel real good.

548
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,960
He's a deadly weapon. He's one of a kind, and he's gonna do it.

549
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,990
Clubber, do you think you're as fast as Balboa?

550
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,740
I'll do my talking in the ring! Clubber, dance for us.

551
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,050
You better get outta here! I wanna be alone!

552
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,070
Will you retire after this fight? This is the last one.

553
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,080
After this, me and Mick are finished. This is definitely the last one.

554
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,040
Y'all parasites and leeches! Get outta here!

555
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,040
What will you do after tonight?

556
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,020
I'm not sure.

557
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,190
Maybe join the circus, eh, Mick? Yeah. Have some fun.

558
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,170
Come on, take your robe off!

559
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,000
I told you to get outta my face!

560
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:56,030
With us this evening is the former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.

561
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,000
Do you have any predictions on this fight? How do you see this fight going tonight?

562
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,990
I feel its strength would have to go to the challenger...

563
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,350
while experience and the world's hardest head would have to go to Rocky Balboa.

564
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,370
I know about that.

565
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,000
Now remember, Rock. Don't trade with this guy.

566
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,920
Take your time, wear him down...

567
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,990
but don't stand toe-to-toe with him.

568
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,060
This punk's never been 15 rounds before.

569
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,020
Take him good. Okay.

570
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,560
Take him good. Okay. I will.

571
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,500
That's it.

572
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,460
So I predict that the champ's gonna take it.

573
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:29,010
Now wait a minute. Do you really think the champion can hit that hard?

574
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,110
Why do you think I'm sitting out here with you?

575
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,030
Hey, sucker! Balboa, you bum! You finished!

576
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,000
You through! You washed up! I'm the baddest in the world!

577
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,580
You're not so bad to me. What you say, paper champion?

578
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,480
I'm gonna beat you like a dog!

579
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,420
Can't you get that ape back into the ring?

580
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,850
You made me wait too long! You gonna pay!

581
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,420
Come on, mouth!

582
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:11,150
Get him outta there, can't you? Get him outta there!

583
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,180
Let me go! Let me go! Get outta my way! Get outta my way!

584
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,040
You know who I am? I'm the man!

585
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,030
You're nothing but dead meat! I'll meet you in the ring, sucker!

586
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,050
You're dead meat!

587
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,010
Let go!

588
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,040
Rocky

589
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,070
What's wrong? It's his heart.

590
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,020
What's wrong, Adrian? Get a doctor!

591
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,180
Somebody get a doctor! Come on!

592
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,170
Sit here, Mick. Get 'em outta here!

593
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,050
Get'em outta here!

594
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,780
Mick, will you sit on the table? I'm all right.

595
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:54,020
Just take a deep breath. Get those guys outta here!

596
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,030
Move! Mick, will you sit on the table?

597
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,070
Paulie, tell 'em the fight's off. Go on! Go on!

598
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,060
The fight's not off. Are you outta your mind?

599
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,020
The fight's on. You crazy?

600
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,060
Mick, we can't, not tonight. I ain't fighting . Yes, tonight we're gonna fight.

601
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,040
Just let me get my breath.

602
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,270
Can't I get my breath? Is that against the rules?

603
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,660
Would you please get a doctor, Paulie?

604
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,980
He's on his way.

605
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,990
Mick, I can't go out there and fight like this. I can't go out like this.

606
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,040
Now get out in there. Get going , will ya?

607
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:23,670
Take him good. Get it over with, why don't ya?

608
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,000
Adrian, what am I supposed to do?

609
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,020
What the hell do you mean, what are you supposed to do?

610
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,030
After all these years together, you don't know what to do?

611
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,070
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

612
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,030
Now get out there and do it.

613
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,060
Do it.

614
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,050
Do it.

615
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,070
You're the best.

616
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,020
Okay.

617
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,040
Oh, my God.

618
00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:00,150
Adrian, take care of him. Take care of him.

619
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen...

620
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,030
and welcome to the featured event...

621
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,050
for the heavyweight championship of the world.

622
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,030
And fans, with us tonight, truly one of the fistic greats...

623
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,050
he's coming up from ringside, the Master of Disaster,

624
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,020
the King of Sting,

625
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,060
the one and only Apollo Creed!

626
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,770
And there he is, the former heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed.

627
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,040
Stu, he looks like nine million dollars.

628
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,030
Get outta my face! I don't need nothing you got no more!

629
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,060
Don't need no has-been messing in my corner.

630
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:41,060
And you better get that bad look off your face before I knock it off.

631
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:44,080
Come on. Wanna jump? Jump. Come on.

632
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,010
Come on, Creed.

633
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,070
Come on!

634
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,090
Yeah, come on!

635
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:54,130
Yeah, just like a chicken. You better run.

636
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,020
Give everybody a present and drop this chump, all right?

637
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,240
All right. Good luck to you.

638
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,050
All right, fans, here we go.

639
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,050
On my left, in the blue corner...

640
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,010
hailing from Chicago,

641
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:16,990
weighing in at an even 235 pounds...

642
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,990
the world's number-one challenger...

643
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,200
I wonder how Mick's doing . the undefeated Clubber Lang!

644
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:28,070
I'm the best. I'm the best!

645
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,050
You and Clubber exchanged words up there. Any comment?

646
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,070
I have no comment.

647
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:35,030
And his opponent, in the opposite corner...

648
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,010
really needing no introduction to the world over.

649
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,080
He weighs in at a trim 201 pounds.

650
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:47,070
The pride of Philadelphia the Italian Stallion

651
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,990
and the reigning heavyweight champion of the world...

652
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,040
Rocky Balboa!

653
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,080
Listen to this crowd.

654
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,090
Now to give instructions in the middle of the ring...

655
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:12,180
the referee, Marty Denkins.

656
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,070
Clubber, Rocky, you know the rules. I want a good, clean fight.

657
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,080
When I tell you to break, I want you to step back at my command and break.

658
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:23,380
Now go back to the corner and come out fighting at the bell.

659
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,490
Dead meat.

660
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,380
This is not gonna be a fight of finesse.

661
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,310
These are two guys that really throw punches.

662
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,310
This could end with one punch. Chump's scared.

663
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
Yeah. Hang him up.

664
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,830
See the look in his eyes?

665
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:49,010
Rocky, I'm no trainer. Just go out and kill the guy. Kill him, Rock.

666
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,060
He's scared.

667
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,020
I'm the new champion, I tell ya. I'm the new champ as of today!

668
00:44:55,030 --> 00:45:00,070
The Italian Stallion, a rugged champion in the final fight of his colorful career tonight.

669
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:05,010
Jimmy Lennon was correct. He looks like well, just great.

670
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:09,730
Here we go. Oh, boy! The champion came out swinging!

671
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,030
Balboa's off to an incredible start.

672
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,230
He looks determined to destroy the bigger challenger.

673
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,150
Get in there! Move him back!

674
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,080
Defense!

675
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,220
Now it's Balboa! They're going at each other!

676
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,050
You got him! You got him, Rock!

677
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,650
Double up! Double up!

678
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,010
Come on!

679
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,000
Come on!

680
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:50,230
The challenger is hitting him with everything he's got.

681
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,050
Come on, Balboa! You made me wait!

682
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,050
Come on, Balboa!

683
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,070
He hobbles away to his corner.

684
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,040
Grab him, Paulie.

685
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:15,050
Where's Mick? Where's Mick? He's okay.

686
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,020
I need him here. I need him.

687
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:20,010
He ain't nothing ! I told you he ain't nothing !

688
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,780
He's too strong. Don't talk like that. Come on.

689
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:27,000
Tear him up! I'm gonna smoke him.

690
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:29,080
I can't keep him off. I can't keep him off.

691
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,990
He's mine! He's mine! I'm gonna get him!

692
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,150
I'm losing it, Paulie. Where's Mick?

693
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,020
What do you got there? 200 over 50.

694
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,030
All right, let's start CPR.

695
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,240
Come on. You can do it. I'll try.

696
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,670
Round two. Rocky appears to be staggering.

697
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,310
I'll get him.

698
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,040
Coming out of the corner, here comes Clubber!

699
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,010
I'm gonna show you!

700
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,080
Come on, Balboa! Hit me!

701
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,090
Give it to me!

702
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,210
Let's see what you can do!

703
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,020
Move on the inside!

704
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:12,150
The champion is helpless. What a beating he's taking!

705
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,030
Unreal! A left to theDon't stand toe-to-toe with him!

706
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,070
Come on, Balboa

707
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:42,060
Get up. Get up, Italian!

708
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,040
Come on! Get up! Five. Six.

709
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,040
Seven. Eight.

710
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,070
Nine. Ten.

711
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:50,090
You're out!

712
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,000
Unbelievable! Incredible! What an upset.

713
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,190
Balboa in the corner out on his feet.

714
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,040
We have the time.

715
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,030
The winner by knockout

716
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,780
new heavyweight champion of the world

717
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,780
Clubber Lang!

718
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I told you I'd do it!

719
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:24,230
Yeah! I'm the new champ of the world!

720
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,040
Go on! Get outta here now!

721
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,890
What happened? I'm all right. How's Mick?

722
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,920
He wouldn't go to the hospital. What?

723
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,910
Time is important. We must get him to the hospital immediately.

724
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:48,870
Okay.

725
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,900
Mick?

726
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,840
What? Mick

727
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,890
Wha...What?

728
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,870
Is it over?

729
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,840
Yeah, it's all over.

730
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,890
Hey, what happened?

731
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,860
It was a knockout.

732
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:31,010
What round? Second round.

733
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,650
That'll do it. That's good.

734
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:36,430
We did it, huh?

735
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:38,900
We did it. We did it.

736
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,880
You don't have to worry anymore. Yeah, okay.

737
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,870
Everything's going to be okay.

738
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,850
You know? We did it.

739
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,930
We gotta get you to a hospital. Get how you used to be again.

740
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,850
You know,

741
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,870
we did everything right.

742
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,860
No. No, listen to me. I did everything right.

743
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,860
We ain't done everything right. We got more to do.

744
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:04,900
Whatever you want to do, we'll do it. Okay?

745
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:09,050
I love you, kid. I love you.

746
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,870
Your instinct

747
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:16,860
Mick?

748
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,920
Mick?

749
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:31,910
Mick?

750
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:36,860
It isn't...Jesus Christ!

751
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,830
Don't go away. Please don't.

752
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,840
We got things we didn't do.

753
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:03,900
We got more to do. We got...

754
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,850
My God

755
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,870
Jesus

756
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,860
This concludes our service.

757
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,410
That's not the way to do it.

758
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,360
Who's that?

759
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:13,520
You should hit it straight. Step into it.

760
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,350
Apollo?

761
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,410
Right. I waited at your house for about an hour.

762
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,390
Your wife said you might be here.

763
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,340
What are you doing here?

764
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,420
Business.

765
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:32,140
If the papers knew we were talking like this, they'd think we was crazy.

766
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:33,370
Why you?

767
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:36,410
'Cause I'm the best, and you need somebody to teach you different.

768
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,360
Why?

769
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,350
To be honest, I don't think you can pull it off without me, Rock.

770
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,340
You still didn't give me the answer. Apollo

771
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,420
What's the real reason?

772
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:49,400
Listen. It's quiet, isn't it?

773
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:52,350
When you retire it's too quiet.

774
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,990
We're too young to retire anyway.

775
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:55,970
Besides, with the right touch...

776
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,140
I could promote this thing into the gate of all time.

777
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,420
It'd be bigger than ours.

778
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:04,420
Heaven knows, I don't mind being involved with large numbers.

779
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,420
Right?

780
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,360
I don't need this no more. I...

781
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:11,370
I don't want this no more.

782
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:13,370
Look, man.

783
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:17,380
When you beat me, I hurt all over.

784
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:21,400
I didn't want to know from nobody, not even my kids.

785
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:23,410
Every fighter knows that hurt.

786
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,330
We get sick inside trying to live with it. Don't back off now.

787
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:31,340
Make it right for yourself or you'll be sorry you didn't.

788
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:36,360
We held the greatest title in the whole world, babe.

789
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,410
You lost that fight for all the wrong reasons.

790
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,400
You lost your edge.

791
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:45,330
All right, I know your manager dying.

792
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,350
had you all messed up inside.

793
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,390
But the truth is, you didn't look hungry.

794
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,360
When we fought

795
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:56,380
you had that eye of the tiger, man the edge.

796
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:00,360
Now you gotta get it back and the way to get it back is to go back to the beginning.

797
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:01,400
You know what I mean?

798
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:07,420
Maybe we could win it back together.

799
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:10,580
Eye of the tiger, man.

800
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:16,590
Why'd you have to come here?

801
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,740
I have the plan. Get back, man.

802
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,630
You got me curious.

803
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,760
You got me curious, Rock.

804
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:36,580
Clubber, do you accept the challenge for a rematch with Balboa?

805
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,820
I reject the challenge, because Balboa is no challenge.

806
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,580
But I'll be more than happy to beat up on him some more.

807
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:44,560
I always said he was nothing .

808
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,540
I can't wait to see him fall.

809
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,550
What do you think of him being trained by Apollo Creed?

810
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,580
Apollo who?

811
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,620
You talking about that old fool Apollo Creed?

812
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:57,550
One has-been teaching another. Just keep talking, pal.

813
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,540
When I see him, I'm gonna close it.

814
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:03,620
All right. When will the match take place?

815
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,570
The sooner the better. I'm the champion of the world.

816
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:09,550
Aing t nothing can be done about that. I can't be beat and I won't be beat.

817
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,540
This time I'm gonna train even harder.

818
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,220
There won't be no quick knockdowns. I'm gonna torture him.

819
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,970
I'm gonna crucify him real bad.

820
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,980
Hard words from a hard man.

821
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:24,770
The odds against Balboa making a comeback at 34 are very long indeed.

822
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,800
Can he do it? Most experts doubt it.

823
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:31,910
Balboa was a fine champion, but his time has passed.

824
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,530
I wish him luck.

825
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,930
Don't listen to it, Rocky.

826
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,980
No, do listen to it, Rock.

827
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:45,110
When this is over, a lot of folks are gonna owe you an engraved apology.

828
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,590
And you're gonna owe me a big favor.

829
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,610
What favor?

830
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:51,570
When it's over.

831
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:00,580
Rocko, come on. We're gonna be late at the airport.

832
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:03,530
Let's go. Have you forgot anything?

833
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,190
I think we have it all. Maybe another sweater.

834
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,570
Nah, California's not that cold.

835
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,540
It's great. It's scorching.

836
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,570
Listen, I want you to be a good boy, okay?

837
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:16,600
Okay. And don't give anybody a hard time.

838
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:17,610
Give me a kiss.

839
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,890
We'll call when we land. Yeah, we'll call.

840
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:35,640
You'll be a good boy? All right.

841
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,050
I'll bring you back something.

842
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,180
What the hell are we doing here in L. A. ?

843
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,210
This is where I started. So?

844
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,190
So this is where he's starting .

845
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,150
This place is disgusting. Why don't we stay at your place?

846
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,220
I think you're missing the point.

847
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,840
Let's check in and get over to the gym.

848
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:38,210
Rock, in my opinion, we don't need this place.

849
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,200
This is below you and the sister's standard.

850
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:44,290
We gotta give it a try. Come on.

851
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,220
I don't even have a gun.

852
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:08,140
Now, fun is fun. I like those kinds of things. But this I don't like.

853
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:13,210
Look at this place. Rats even have more pride than to be caught dead here.

854
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:17,160
I mean, look at the dump. I just don't like it.

855
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:21,310
Think of Adrian's health. I'm fine, Paulie.

856
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,330
It's Balboa, what's he doing here?

857
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,210
This is where I started.

858
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:59,310
That's your problem. Let's leave before they leave us for dead.

859
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:05,200
You see that look in their eyes?

860
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:09,210
When we fought I trained hard, but I didn't have that look in my eyes.

861
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,180
You had it, and you won.

862
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:15,130
You gotta get that look back.

863
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:18,150
Eye of the tiger, man. Come on.

864
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,230
Let's go.

865
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,160
Look at this place. No class in here.

866
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:26,610
Is he always so cheerful? I don't sweat you.

867
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,510
Don't get mentally irregular.

868
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,520
It's a free country.

869
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,200
Just don't get irregular.

870
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,140
I don't need no philosophy lesson here.

871
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,130
It just takes about six years to get to know him.

872
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,150
I ain't got six years!

873
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,350
Come on, Paulie. Just relax.

874
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:44,180
We're on business.

875
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,880
Hey, champ!

876
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,920
Hey, my man!

877
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,900
Everything's set up and ready to go, baby.

878
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,900
I know you know who this man is.

879
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:58,830
It's gonna be good working with you. Certainly had enough of working against you.

880
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,830
How do you feel? Pretty good, thanks.

881
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,890
We've been living modern, but now we're gonna train old.

882
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,890
I'm going over here and talk to some of the guys.

883
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,870
The champ is home!

884
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:12,830
We've gotta leave. I've got a reputation.

885
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,880
What do you mean, reputation?

886
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,910
You heard. I don't like these people.

887
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,860
You don't like them?

888
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,920
Well, maybe they don't like you either.

889
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:24,910
What did I do to them?

890
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,900
And they call me punchy.

891
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,840
Stallion, come on over here and meet some of the fellas.

892
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:31,870
I'll be right back.

893
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:32,910
How you doing , guys?

894
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:47,890
That's it. Come on. On the toes,

895
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,890
on the toes.

896
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,850
Come on, Rocky.

897
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:57,850
He ain't too graceful.

898
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:58,920
That's why we're here.

899
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,880
You're wasting time. He's got heavy feet.

900
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:05,900
Get on the balls of your feet. Come on. Relax.

901
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,910
Get those feet out of the concrete.

902
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,880
It'll take time, but it'll come.

903
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:13,870
He can't train to the jungle junk music.

904
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,890
Relax, Rock. Here we go.

905
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,850
Balance your feet.

906
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:20,900
Let your body find the rhythm. Start a new dance called "the crawl. "

907
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:23,900
You can't train him like a colored fighter.

908
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:26,070
He ain't got no rhythm.

909
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:29,890
How stupid do I look? You look great

910
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:34,020
Everything we do works off the jab.

911
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:35,890
Can he swim?

912
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,900
With a name like Rock?

913
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,830
No time to waste. Let's go. Another lap. Move it!

914
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,920
Another lap!

915
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,900
He ain't no tuna. We belong back in the gym.

916
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:49,830
He's gotta strengthen and use muscles he never thought he had.

917
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,860
Stretch, now. Move it, Rock!

918
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:56,830
Nobody could change that much. He's a bruiser. He ain't no boxer.

919
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,860
You keep telling him that and he'll be nothing.

920
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:02,850
Yeah? Another lap! Come on, now!

921
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,910
Move it! Move it!

922
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:06,900
Move it, Rock! Come on! Let's go!

923
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:10,130
That's it, stretch it. Stretch it out.

924
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:13,480
Let's go. You gotta pull hard, now.

925
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:24,500
Shut up, you Sterno bums! I'll squash ya!

926
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:26,910
There's decent people trying to sleep!

927
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,840
Shut up, you honky scum bastard!

928
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,900
Who needs this sick place?

929
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:32,920
I don't.

930
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,850
No class.

931
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,910
Damn, that Clubber's strong.

932
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,890
Fifteen rounds is a long time.

933
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,030
We gotta put him away early.

934
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:53,180
I figure with the pace we gotta set, Rock can last maybe...

935
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:54,930
seven or eight rounds.

936
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,880
Then we'll be out of steam, man.

937
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:02,040
We got to put him away early.

938
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:08,030
At least the water's hot.

939
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,380
Well, we never really had a honeymoon.

940
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,870
It's not so bad.

941
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:22,040
You've been in worse places.

942
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,880
Rocky's in trouble in round two!

943
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:30,030
He takes a right and then an upper! He's been cut! Rocky's been cut!

944
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,890
Come on, now.

945
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:38,920
You gotta get tougher. Think smooth.

946
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:44,050
Bounce, bounce, bounce. Toes, toes. On your toes

947
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:46,890
Push yourself! Concentrate!

948
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,870
Let's move it! Move it now!

949
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,890
come on, Rocky, come on

950
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:53,960
Have fun with this. Have fun with it.

951
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,930
That's it. Easy, easy.

952
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,880
Don't push it. Let it come.

953
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:04,870
It'll come. It just takes time, baby.

954
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,840
Come on, Move your head. Up and down.

955
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:11,880
Come on. Slip now, up and down.

956
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:14,920
In and out. Inside. Inside, baby.

957
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,860
Side to side. Move your head.

958
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:21,000
Watch him, now. Remember, he's got two hands, right?

959
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:26,860
Damn, man! What the hell you doing?

960
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:30,990
This guy will knock you on your ass!

961
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:33,910
Come on. It's not a game.

962
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,220
You wanna live in the hospital for five weeks this time?

963
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:40,890
You thought I was tough? This chump will kill you!

964
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,850
All right. Get your head on your shoulders.

965
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,880
Think about the fight. Think about the fight.

966
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:49,910
Clubber Lang's in, and he's trying to hurt you.

967
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:50,530
Here it comes.

968
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:52,890
He's jabbing. He's trying to hurt you.

969
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,040
You gotta fight him. Move!

970
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,860
He's hooking. He's hooking.

971
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,860
Damn, Rock, come on!

972
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,880
What's the matter with you?

973
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,830
Tomorrow. Let's do it tomorrow.

974
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,840
There is no tomorrow!

975
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,930
There is no tomorrow!

976
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,840
There is no tomorrow!

977
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,900
Look, there's just one thing that you gotta remember. We gotta get some speed.

978
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:35,500
You gotta get some flexibility. You gotta get some quickness. You understand?

979
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:36,900
Quickness and endurance. That's the end of it.

980
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:39,920
That's the only thing we gotta concern ourselves with.

981
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:43,030
Mickey never had me do this.

982
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,930
Okay, here we go.

983
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:48,850
Ready?

984
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:54,880
Set? YeahGo!

985
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:57,500
Come on!

986
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:08,880
Come on!

987
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,200
You can't win, Rock!

988
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,530
You ain't been hungry since you won that belt.

989
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:22,030
He'll knock you into tomorrow.

990
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,930
What's the matter?

991
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:08,900
It's over.

992
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:10,900
It's all over.

993
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,040
What's the matter with you?

994
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,850
Can I talk to you?

995
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,840
I wanna ask you something important and I want you to tell me the truth.

996
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:11,840
What?

997
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,920
Why did you come here?

998
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:18,850
I just don't want it no more.

999
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:22,860
If it's over because you want it to be over, I'm glad.

1000
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:23,880
I do.

1001
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:30,070
It's just you've never quit anything since I've known you.

1002
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,830
I don't know what you want me to say.

1003
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,860
I mean, what happened?

1004
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:41,060
How did everything that was so good get so bad?

1005
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:43,880
What's so bad? Tell me, what?

1006
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:46,910
I wrecked everything by not thinking for myself.

1007
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,860
Why couldn't Mickey tell me where it was right from the start?

1008
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:53,890
He didn't have to carry me and lie to me and make me think...

1009
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,870
I was better than I really was when I wasn't. He never lied.

1010
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,910
Those fights weren't right. They weren't.

1011
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,920
I never fought anybody who was all in their prime.

1012
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:05,840
It was always some angle to hold the title longer than I should've had it.

1013
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:07,840
Do you understand what I'm saying here?

1014
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:12,850
I understand, but you've gotta understand that he loved you and that was his job-protecting you.

1015
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:15,850
But that protecting don't help nothing . It only makes things worse.

1016
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:18,900
You wake up after a few years thinking you're a winner, but you're not.

1017
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:23,870
You're really a loser. We wouldn't have had the title as long.

1018
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,870
So what? At least it would've been real.

1019
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,870
It was real!

1020
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:29,870
Nothing is real if you don't believe in who you are!

1021
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,920
I don't believe in myself no more! Don't you understand?

1022
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:35,870
When a fighter don't believe, that's it! He's finished! It's over!

1023
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,840
That's not it! That it is.

1024
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:38,880
Why don't you tell me the truth?

1025
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:40,900
What are you putting me through?

1026
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:44,840
You wanna know the truth? The truth is I don't wanna lose what I got.

1027
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:46,900
In the beginning, I didn't care about what happened to me.

1028
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:50,860
I'd get busted up. I didn't care. But now there's you, the kid.

1029
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:54,870
I don't wanna lose what I got! What do we have that can't be replaced?

1030
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,890
A house. We got cars, money.

1031
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,900
We got everything but the truth.

1032
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:01,880
What's the truth, damn it?

1033
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:05,840
I'm afraid, all right? You wanna hear me say it?

1034
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:09,870
You wanna break me down? For the first time in my life, I'm afraid!

1035
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,880
I'm afraid too. There's nothing wrong with being afraid.

1036
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:15,890
For me there is! You're human, aren't you?

1037
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,830
I don't know what I am. All I know is I'm a liar and because of

1038
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,840
that Mickey ain't here no more.

1039
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:22,850
You didn't push him into anything!

1040
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,830
He was a grown man and he did what he had to!

1041
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,870
And you have no right to feel guilty for what happened.

1042
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,860
You were a champion and you did what you were expected to do...

1043
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:34,840
and you did what I and everybody else thought you should do.

1044
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:38,900
And you wanna tell me those fights weren't real? I don't believe it!

1045
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,860
But it doesn't matter what I believe...

1046
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:43,870
because you're the one that's gotta carry that fear around inside you...

1047
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,870
afraid that everybody's gonna take things away...

1048
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,910
afraid you're gonna be remembered as a coward that you're not a man anymore.

1049
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,860
Well, none of it's true. But it doesn't matter if I tell you.

1050
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:57,870
It doesn't matter because you're the one that's gotta settle it.

1051
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,870
Get rid of it,

1052
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:02,900
because when all the smoke has cleared and everyone's through chanting your name

1053
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:07,910
it's just gonna be us! You can't live like this. We can't live like this.

1054
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,920
'Cause it's gonna bother you for the rest of your life.

1055
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:14,000
Look what it's doing to you now.

1056
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:22,900
Apollo thinks you can do it. So do I.

1057
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:25,870
But you've got to want to do it for the right reasons

1058
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:29,910
not for the guilt over Mickey, not for the people not for the title,

1059
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,880
not for money or me. For you.

1060
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:37,050
Just you. Just you alone.

1061
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:41,860
And if I lose?

1062
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:46,850
Then you lose. But at least you lose with no excuses,

1063
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:47,910
no fear.

1064
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:52,010
And I know you can live with that.

1065
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:02,020
How'd you get so tough?

1066
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,010
I live with a fighter.

1067
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,900
I really love you.

1068
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:21,870
I love you.

1069
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,850
Just flick it.

1070
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:09,930
Five more laps.

1071
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:47,840
You gotta move in faster.

1072
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,850
Faster! Faster!

1073
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:03,880
Very nice.

1074
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,050
Move your head! Move your head!

1075
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:29,880
That was nice.

1076
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:40,930
Come on, come on

1077
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:42,920
Speed

1078
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,870
Ready

1079
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,880
Rocky is fish

1080
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:56,840
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Stu Nahan along with Bill Baldwin.

1081
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:59,830
We welcome you to Madison Square Garden

1082
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,910
a most-exciting backdrop for the anxiously awaited rematch

1083
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,860
between the former champion, Rocky Balboa

1084
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:07,830
and the reigning heavyweight champion, Clubber Lang.

1085
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,860
We now switch to our remote cameras inside the dressing rooms.

1086
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:15,860
Would you care to comment on how you plan to fight Balboa? What's your strategy?

1087
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:16,860
Don't need any.

1088
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:20,120
Balboa's so predictable and stupid. The man comes straight ahead.

1089
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:24,140
He's tailor-made for me, and he's gonna get hurt.

1090
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,880
Nice, just make sure you turn them over.

1091
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:30,840
How does that look? Okay?

1092
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,920
No, I don't hate Balboa, but I pity the fool.

1093
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:38,060
And I will destroy any man who tries to take what I got.

1094
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,850
Remember where you came from.

1095
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:46,900
Remember what it took to get you here.

1096
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:49,890
And you remember what he did to you last time, right?

1097
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:53,870
Since both men are brawlers, with the edge and power going to Lang.

1098
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:58,850
I would say that the odds are long against Balboa regaining his title.

1099
01:19:58,860 --> 01:19:59,910
Now it's your turn.

1100
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:01,930
It's your turn, huh?

1101
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:06,860
What's your prediction for the fight then? Prediction?

1102
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:08,840
Yes, prediction.

1103
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,880
Pain.

1104
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:15,200
Lang is a brawler who likes to hurt a man to the body.

1105
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:18,880
And Balboa may never have psychologically recovered

1106
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:21,860
from that vicious knockout that Clubber laid on him.

1107
01:20:22,930 --> 01:20:24,840
It's time.

1108
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:28,840
Here. What?

1109
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,070
I want you to wear these.

1110
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:38,830
Come on, Apollo. These are...

1111
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:41,910
the colors that you wore in our first fight together.

1112
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,020
I can't wear your colors. Just wear 'em.

1113
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,860
Apollo, Thanks.

1114
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:53,880
Just make sure you wash 'em before you bring 'em back, all right?

1115
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,900
Will do. Will do.

1116
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:57,920
Thanks, Apollo.

1117
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:02,850
And remember. After this, you owe me a favor.

1118
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:03,900
What favor?

1119
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,890
I have to agree. Toe-to-toe...

1120
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:10,030
Lang is utterly devastating and he's much too strong.

1121
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:13,920
All right, listen. I just wanna tell you I'm proud of you.

1122
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:16,430
It takes a hell of a man to change, and you did it.

1123
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:17,940
You're gonna prove it tonight, right? Right.

1124
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,490
You did good, Apollo. Thanks, Paulie.

1125
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,840
Let's do it, Paulie. Let's go.

1126
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:29,020
Here comes Rocky and Apollo, the two former champions.

1127
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:34,850
Take a look at Rocky.

1128
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,870
Look at the tenseness in his face, the tautness of that body.

1129
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,860
Boy, does he look serious right now. He certainly does.

1130
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:45,840
And you know, the word is this is Rocky's last fight win, lose or draw.

1131
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:49,920
And there he is. The Italian Stallion Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring.

1132
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:52,840
Boy, he looks incredibly thin, doesn't he?

1133
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:54,890
I'd say he's gotta be about 20 pounds lighter.

1134
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,880
Rocky Balboa, the iron man from Philadelphia.

1135
01:21:57,890 --> 01:22:02,040
And this crowd is certainly with him tonight. Listen

1136
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,920
Balboa doesn't really have any boxing skills.

1137
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:07,900
I've never seen a fighter with as much raw determination.

1138
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:09,900
Hold it, Stu. Here comes the champion now.

1139
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:15,020
Clubber Lang. Listen to this crowd.

1140
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,900
Take a look at those eyes. I've never seen a guy with such sullen eyes.

1141
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:20,920
He is tough.

1142
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:25,010
Clubber, go back where you came from!

1143
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:28,910
He even belted a spectator on the way in. Did you see that?

1144
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,840
Look at that man. Boy, awesome. Awesome.

1145
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:33,890
He's tough. Look at that.

1146
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,890
The heavyweight champion of the world.

1147
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,880
Just keep it as quickHey, fool!

1148
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,880
You ready for another beating?

1149
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:42,910
You should've never came back.

1150
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,930
Don't look at him.

1151
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:45,850
Let's just be cool.

1152
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:46,910
Hey, boy.

1153
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:48,920
Boy.

1154
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:51,900
After I crucify him, you're next.

1155
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:53,910
Just stay out of my face, chump.

1156
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,840
Don't turn your back on me, sucker!

1157
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:57,870
We got a brawl before the bell!

1158
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,870
Apollo and Clubber wanna go at each other right now.

1159
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,880
This thing is ready to explode! The fight is about to begin,

1160
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:04,880
but these guys wanna start right now!

1161
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:06,830
Come onLet me go, let me go.

1162
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,840
I'm gonna get you! Let him go!

1163
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:09,880
Come on!

1164
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:11,870
Let him go! I want him!

1165
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:14,840
I thought you said, "Be cool. "That was cool!

1166
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:17,850
I'm the champ! I'll beat ya like I did last time!

1167
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:20,860
You won't have to look to find me! I'm here!

1168
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:23,900
Ladies and gentlemen, and boxing fans on the round of world

1169
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:26,870
Welcome to Madison Square Gardens...

1170
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,880
and tonight's heavyweight championship of the world!

1171
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:32,880
This crowd is ready tonight.

1172
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:34,880
In the red corner

1173
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,880
the challenger...

1174
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:39,930
weighing 191 pounds.

1175
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:43,880
From the fighting city of Philadelphia...

1176
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:47,840
the former heavyweight champion of the world...

1177
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:49,850
the Italian Stallion...

1178
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:52,930
Rocky Balboa!

1179
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:02,850
I'll tell you something. He has so slimmed down...

1180
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:04,870
he looks like a middleweight.

1181
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,920
Out of the blue corner...

1182
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,870
weighing 237 pounds...

1183
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,850
the hard-punching battler from Chicago...

1184
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:17,880
the reigning heavyweight champion of the world...

1185
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:20,880
Clubber Lang!

1186
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,920
Referee Lou Filippo.

1187
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:25,930
Okay, boy, let's go

1188
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:28,900
We went over the rules yesterday.

1189
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:30,920
I'm just gonna repeat a few of them.

1190
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:33,890
Let's watch your low blows and the rabbit punches.

1191
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,870
In case of a knockdown, you go to the corner I tell you to

1192
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,860
and you stay there until I tell you to come out.

1193
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:42,870
Is that understood? Any questions?

1194
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,900
Okay, let's go back to your corner now. Let's go

1195
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:47,890
I'm gonna bust you up.

1196
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:49,920
Go for it.

1197
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:54,900
Well, here we go. The war is on.

1198
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,880
We're just waiting for the bell.

1199
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:58,900
Take my belt off. I'm gonna beat that chump.

1200
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:02,860
Don't let this bum let you fight his fight. You're the best!

1201
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:03,890
Here you go, champ.

1202
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,910
Rhythm and power.

1203
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:10,050
Keep that jab up. Thanks.

1204
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:17,870
We're ready for round one now. Should be a great fight.

1205
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:18,890
And here we go.

1206
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,850
Rocky goes right out of his corner!

1207
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:24,910
He goes right after Clubber Lang! He's throwing rights and lefts into Clubber's face.

1208
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,880
What a start of a fight here!

1209
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:29,890
Another jab. Another jab.

1210
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:31,860
And another. This is not the Rocky we expected.

1211
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:33,850
He's dancing like Apollo Creed.

1212
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:34,900
Looks fantastic.

1213
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:40,870
Another right.

1214
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:43,880
There's a right. Look at that right to left to the head!

1215
01:25:43,890 --> 01:25:45,920
Clubber Lang doesn't know what's happening right now.

1216
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:51,070
He's being stunned by this style. Look at the shots he's taking.

1217
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,860
I can't believe I'm saying this, but he can't corner the challenger.

1218
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:59,070
It's absolutely unbelievable.

1219
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:02,890
Come on! Bring it to me! Hit me!

1220
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:07,010
That right hand is just like a trip hammer.

1221
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:11,860
Rocky, tie him up! Come on!

1222
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:14,860
Hit me! Step back! Come on!

1223
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,870
Tough first round! Tough first round!

1224
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,860
And it's Rocky with a couple of rights and lefts to Lang.

1225
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:21,850
Get off!

1226
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:23,860
This crowd's going absolutely wild!

1227
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:28,000
The folks are becoming absolutely wired

1228
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:34,840
There's a good left-right combination by Rocky.

1229
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:35,920
And a good left hand!

1230
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:44,020
This is Rocky Balboa's night.

1231
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:57,850
We've got pandemonium in the ring at the end of round one.

1232
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:01,860
Lang wants more. He can't realize the round is over.

1233
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:03,870
He's trying to get back to Rocky.

1234
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,850
All right, all right. You look great.

1235
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:07,910
Just don't get crazy and we're home.

1236
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:08,930
I'll kill you, man!

1237
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:10,890
The man is strong.

1238
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:15,080
Next round, I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna kill him!

1239
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,920
Now, he's gonna come hard, right?

1240
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:19,910
Keep crowding him. Don't give him a chance to set.

1241
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:24,070
Counter and move. Counter and move.

1242
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:28,870
I don't think Lang knew what hit him in this whole first round.

1243
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,920
Here we go.

1244
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:35,020
Now it's Lang coming out strong at the start of round two.

1245
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,910
Rocky's still landing those rights and lefts.

1246
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,880
He's using his right in the center of the ring.

1247
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:46,530
He's really setting him up. Right, right, right!

1248
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:48,920
Five unanswered shots.

1249
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:49,930
Kill him!

1250
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:56,840
Get out of there!

1251
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:57,910
Get back there!

1252
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,900
All right!

1253
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,840
Come on! Break it up!

1254
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:10,880
What are you doing?

1255
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,890
Come on, Balboa!

1256
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:14,880
Let's get those feet moving!

1257
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:16,900
Get your hands up!

1258
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,860
That right hand hurt Rocky again.

1259
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:26,780
He's got him in the corner. Balboa's in a little trouble now.

1260
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,380
Hold him, damn it!

1261
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,850
Come on, Rocky!

1262
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:38,920
This is Clubber's round so far. Lang is taking the momentum here.

1263
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:42,860
He hold Balboa

1264
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:47,870
And Balboa is down! You'd better get up

1265
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,890
Get up! Damn it!

1266
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:50,890
Five.

1267
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:52,920
Can he get up? He's in trouble.

1268
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:54,930
He's up!

1269
01:28:57,930 --> 01:29:00,920
And here comes Clubber again. Lang with the left hand.

1270
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:03,830
Lang with another left hand. Now a right.

1271
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,840
Another right! Another right!

1272
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:08,920
And down goes Balboa again!

1273
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:09,880
Stop the fight!

1274
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:11,860
Six.

1275
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,840
I got some more for you.

1276
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,910
I got a lot of moves. Come on. Here we go again.

1277
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,860
Clubber coming into him.

1278
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,860
You ain't so bad!

1279
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:31,920
You ain't so bad! You must be crazy or something!

1280
01:29:31,930 --> 01:29:34,850
I'm crazy? You're just a stupid fool!

1281
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:38,830
But I ain't breathing heavy! He is a fool!

1282
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,870
How could he come back from a beating like that?

1283
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,900
What the hell are you doing?

1284
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:45,850
It's a strategy, that's all. I know what I'm doing.

1285
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:46,900
You don't know what you're doing!

1286
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:48,370
He's gotta come to you! You're the champ!

1287
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:50,380
He's nothing! He's mine!

1288
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:52,890
You stand toe-to-toe with this bum and he'll kill you.

1289
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:55,000
It doesn't take a man to stand there and get your head beat off.

1290
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:57,190
Don't...He's getting tired.

1291
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:00,200
Look, don't go wasting your punches! You're the champ!

1292
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:03,180
Don't try to take him out with one punch! Use your head!

1293
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:05,170
Now, you wear him down, he's all ours.

1294
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:07,420
I know what I'm doing. I swear.

1295
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:09,500
Don't tell me what you think!

1296
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:12,420
Go out there and do it. Eye of the tiger. You understand?

1297
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:13,130
Yeah

1298
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:17,640
Go out there and knock his head off. He's just a man.

1299
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:20,310
Be more man than him! Eye of the tiger!

1300
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,200
Eye of the tiger!

1301
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,430
up to down, side to side

1302
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:27,510
The beginning of round three. Tough rounds to call right now.

1303
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:28,950
This is a little slower than the start.

1304
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:31,820
It's my round.

1305
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,920
It's my round. I'm gonna take you this time. Come on.

1306
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:37,910
I'm gonna take you. You're mine. You're mine.

1307
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,010
Come on. I'm gonna get you.

1308
01:30:58,680 --> 01:30:59,890
Get out there

1309
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:03,840
Stick him!

1310
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:16,900
He's getting killed! He's not getting killed. He's getting mad.

1311
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:21,030
The whole world's watching. Knock me out!

1312
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,060
You can hit hard! Hit me harder!

1313
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:31,890
Get out of there!

1314
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:49,090
My mother hits harder than that! A little harder! Hit me in the face!

1315
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:53,560
Again! Come on! You ain't so bad!

1316
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:19,870
I might believe the strategy now. He's making Clubber Lang miss now.

1317
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:24,320
See how he drew him in? Now Rocky's throwing the punches. But look at the punches.

1318
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:32,030
He's lifting him off the canvas with those punches to the ribs!

1319
01:32:57,910 --> 01:32:59,930
Now!

1320
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:10,930
Come on

1321
01:33:11,930 --> 01:33:13,890
Come on

1322
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:29,860
The place has gone berserk!

1323
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:31,830
What a tremendous comeback!

1324
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,860
Get up!

1325
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:37,800
Five. Six. Seven.

1326
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,870
Eight. Nine.

1327
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:42,850
Ten. You're out!

1328
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:47,060
the new heavyweight champion of the world

1329
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:52,930
And there he is

1330
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:59,080
The new heavyweight champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

1331
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,900
Rocky is exhausted!

1332
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:05,900
We do it.

1333
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:10,830
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner by knockout

1334
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:11,870
Are you all right?

1335
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:14,930
Never better.

1336
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:19,850
The heavyweight champion of the world...

1337
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:20,930
the Italian Stallion

1338
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:23,600
Rocky Balboa!

1339
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:25,860
Rocky Balboa!

1340
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:34,440
Come on. We made a deal.

1341
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:36,450
I know, but this is extremely crazy.

1342
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:38,470
It's mentally irregular, right? Yeah.

1343
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,460
But it makes all the sense in the world. You owe me a favor.

1344
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:44,460
I know. When did you think of this?

1345
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:45,520
About three years ago.

1346
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:49,440
This is very crazy, Apollo. Look, Stallion

1347
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:52,260
when you won that last fight, you won by one second.

1348
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:53,510
You beat me by one second.

1349
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,120
That's very hard for a man of my intelligence to handle.

1350
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:59,480
Didn't you say after I beat you, you learned how to live with it?

1351
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:02,480
I lied. Oh, you lied.

1352
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:06,430
So now you just gotta prove it to yourself, huh?

1353
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,170
No TV, no newspapers. Just you and me.

1354
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:12,170
Nothing. Just you and me. Age before beauty.

1355
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:15,520
Anything you say, Stallion. I'll do all the work.

1356
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:17,510
I'll tell you, you better go slow...

1357
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,450
'cause you ain't as young as springtime anymore.

1358
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:21,440
I'm still young enough to whip your butt, Stallion.

1359
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:22,470
Oh, yeah?

1360
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:25,980
How are you gonna do that? You taught me everything you know.

1361
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:29,000
Almost everything. You gotta remember, now.

1362
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:32,450
You fight great, but I'm a great fighter. You ready?

1363
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:33,780
Absolutely.

1364
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,410
All right

1365
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:40,330
You know, Stallion? It's too bad we gotta get old, huh?

1366
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,100
Just keep punching.

1367
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,220
You wanna ring the bell?

1368
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,530
All right. Ding, ding.

1369
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:52,520
Come on

1370
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:56,500
Come on, come on

1371
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:00,920
Boy, you really move good for an older guy.

1372
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:03,500
You're looking good, Stallion. I taught you well.

1373
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:05,560
I think you taught me too good.

1374
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,510
You can fly. Look out, now.

1375
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,480
You don't want any of this. Come on.

1376
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:13,520
Come on. Maybe I'm in here with the wrong guy.

1377
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:17,600
Watch yourself. Ready?
