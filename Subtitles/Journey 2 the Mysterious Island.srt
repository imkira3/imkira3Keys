1
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,828
In the 19th century...

2
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:42,291
...Jules Verne wrote some of
the greatest adventure stories ever told.

3
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,085
Novels such as Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea...

4
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,421
...Journey to the Center of the Earth...

5
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,716
...and The Mysterious Island.

6
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,302
Most consider these
works of science fiction.

7
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,222
Vernians know otherwise.

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,199
Not good!

9
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,039
Whoa!

10
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,137
Ha-ha-ha. Aah!

11
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,265
Whoa! Good boy!

12
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:43,936
Seriously?

13
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,607
Okay.

14
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,441
Here we...

15
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,526
...go!

16
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,558
Evening, officers.
Anyone up for a late night swim?

17
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,665
Hey, buddy.
Missed you at poker this week.

18
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,500
Thanks for the call.
What's going on?

19
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,544
We didn't want this
going out over the radio.

20
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,755
Kid broke into a satellite facility.

21
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:55,924
Then he drove...

22
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,009
...his dirt bike into...

23
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,345
...the McGillicuttys' pool.
I talked them out of pressing charges.

24
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,390
Anderson!

25
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,434
Your stepfather's here for you.

26
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,814
No. Legal guardian.

27
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,903
If it weren't for me,
you'd be in juvie for the next six months.

28
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,113
Rather do the time.

29
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,287
Do you want to explain to me...

30
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,957
...why you were breaking into a satellite facility
in the middle of nowhere?

31
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,418
Don't worry about it, Mom.
It's nothing, really.

32
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,463
The police calling in the middle
of the night is nothing?

33
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,548
Sean?

34
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,220
What was he doing there?
What was he looking for?

35
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,264
Honey, I don't know.
All we can do is ask him.

36
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,976
Hey. Sean, we gotta talk about this.

37
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,187
I'm confused.
Who gave him a speaking part?

38
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,648
- Hey.
- Without my speaking part, we'd visit you...

39
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,567
...in jail right now.
- I'm already in jail.

40
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,445
What is that supposed to mean?
Sean?

41
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,951
I didn't ask to be taken away from my school
and friends, and dragged all the way to Dayton.

42
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,245
- It's okay, Liz.
- No, it's not.

43
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,287
Sean!

44
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,458
- Sean!
- It's gotta be tough on him...

45
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,045
...with his father gone.
- That still doesn't excuse his behavior.

46
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,314
Okay.

47
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,359
Now that I got you, I just gotta figure out
what you mean.

48
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,159
Not here.

49
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,911
Hey, it's me. You busy?

50
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,705
Yes.

51
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,459
I was looking to talk to you.

52
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,630
You know, very concerned adult
to somewhat troubled youth.

53
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,674
Which one am I in that equation?

54
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,638
Cracked up the walkway to my door

55
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,098
Brought you as a...

56
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,977
Hey, buddy.

57
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:16,815
What's all this?

58
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,275
Nothing.

59
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,361
That's a cryptogram, right?
Looks like Morse code.

60
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,196
Mm-hm.

61
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,031
Yeah, look.

62
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,658
One syllable words, dots.
Two syllable words, dashes.

63
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,285
I learned that in the Navy.

64
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,956
Okay, then. What's it say?

65
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:33,874
What's it for?

66
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:34,958
It's complicated.

67
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,628
So is the code.

68
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,508
Okay. Here's the deal.

69
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,261
A few nights ago,
a radio signal got sent out.

70
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,889
Could've been anywhere.
It was these words on a loop.

71
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,309
"Pip, Zorn, Strux."

72
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,896
All characters from the books of Verne.
The message was by a Vernian.

73
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,317
And my equipment wasn't powerful enough
to receive the whole message, so...

74
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,403
So you broke into that satellite facility
to boost your signal.

75
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,656
Someone sent this message
and I'm gonna be the person to solve it.

76
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,909
This is really important to me.

77
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,748
Hey, you know what?
Why don't we solve this together?

78
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,209
Fine.

79
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,002
Okay.

80
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,589
The first part of the message reads,
"The...

81
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,050
...I-S-L."

82
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,635
Island.

83
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,886
"Is..."

84
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,099
R-E. "Real. The island is real."

85
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,977
You're serious?
You're not messing with me?

86
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,897
No. That's what it says.
"The island is real."

87
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,442
I can't believe it. I can't believe
somebody actually found the island.

88
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,568
What island?

89
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,741
The Mysterious Island. Vernians
have been looking for this for years.

90
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,118
What's the rest say?

91
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,289
"Child of Steve, born...

92
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,791
...eighteen...

93
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,292
...eight-three."

94
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,710
"Born 1883."

95
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,421
Child of Steve. Child of Steve.

96
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,797
Maybe "son of Steve"?

97
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,090
Steven's son. Stevenson.

98
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,716
- Robert Louis Stevenson.
- The author.

99
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,261
He was born way before 1883.
Gotta be somebody else.

100
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,763
Maybe it's not a somebody.

101
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,640
Maybe it's a something.

102
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,231
What are we looking for?

103
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,899
Come on.

104
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,283
Aha!

105
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,661
Treasure Island, written by
Robert Louis Stevenson in 1883.

106
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,373
- What's the next part of the riddle?
- All right.

107
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,627
"The name that's last is going fast.

108
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:47,757
- He hitched his tale to Lemuel's mast."
- Okay, so his...

109
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,302
...last name is going fast. A runner?
- What if his last name...

110
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,429
...is fast?

111
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,014
Fleet or Quick. Swift.

112
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,640
Swift. Jonathan Swift.

113
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,350
Another author.

114
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,228
Writing about another island.

115
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,691
So "Lemuel" must be...

116
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,820
Nice. Lemuel Gulliver.

117
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,073
- We have three different books.
- By three different authors.

118
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,284
About three different islands.

119
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,495
Maybe...

120
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,664
Maybe all three books
are about the same island.

121
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,083
Maybe that's why nobody else
has ever found it...

122
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,711
...because they haven't used
the other two books.

123
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,254
Treasure Island's got a map.

124
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,548
Yeah, Swift has one too.

125
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,884
These are different than Verne's.
I don't get it.

126
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,727
What are you doing?

127
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,316
You know what I did
in the Navy, Sean?

128
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,859
No.

129
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,324
I won the esteemed...

130
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,202
...Rochefort Award...

131
00:08:59,121 --> 00:08:59,996
...three years in a row...

132
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,460
...for code-breaking.

133
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,128
Incredible.

134
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,798
We found your Mysterious Island.

135
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,383
Uh, what are those?

136
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:12,926
Coordinates.

137
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,177
Longitude and latitude.

138
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,641
And that'll put us right about...

139
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,810
...here.

140
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,814
That's 100 miles off the coast of Palau,
in the middle of the South Pacific.

141
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,318
What are you doing?

142
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,445
- I gotta go.
- Go where?

143
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,738
To Mysterious Island.

144
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,117
All right, cool. Hey, can you stop by
the moon and grab me a Slurpee?

145
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,410
Joke all you want.

146
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,706
Yeah, I will, and you're gonna be here to
listen to it. You're not going to Palau, Sean.

147
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,874
Why not?

148
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,003
Number one, you're grounded.
On top of that, you got school.

149
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,424
I'm a straight-A student. I can afford to miss
a couple days. This is Mysterious Island.

150
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,592
Slow down. Okay?

151
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,884
You think you'll travel...

152
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,136
...around the world...

153
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,762
...meet up with some lunatic...

154
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,515
...messing around on a ham radio?
- It's not some lunatic.

155
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,145
It's Alexander Anderson,
my grandfather.

156
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,856
How would you know he sent that?

157
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,650
Makes sense.
He's the original Vernian in the family...

158
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:15,071
...he's been looking for the island half his life
and nobody's heard from him in two years.

159
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,617
- I think he's in trouble. I'm gonna find him.
- Sean, stop. Sean.

160
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,785
Stop!

161
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,497
I'm not letting you go on a rescue mission
by yourself. Whether you like it or not...

162
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,916
...you're still a kid.

163
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,086
Look, I understand your situation, okay?

164
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,882
You wanna make my mom happy
and I appreciate that. I really do.

165
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,093
But you need to just focus on
running your construction company...

166
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,972
...and paying the mortgage
and asking her how her day was...

167
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,682
...because I'm okay.

168
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,311
And like it or not,
this is bigger than you.

169
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,785
Apparently the message
was sent by his grandfather.

170
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,121
Sean said he's been missing
for a couple years.

171
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,624
It's hard to be missing
if you were never around.

172
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,503
I wouldn't trust one word
from Alexander Anderson.

173
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,254
Sean seems really convinced.

174
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,590
Oh, it's always convincing
from Alexander.

175
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,094
I see. So in Sean's mind,
Alexander's this glamorous adventurer.

176
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,428
When in reality...

177
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,807
...he was a man that wasn't there
when his family needed him the most.

178
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,558
That's why we need to let Sean...

179
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,394
...go on this trip.
- Why?

180
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,020
Sean needs a man in his life.

181
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,690
Somebody who'll be there for him
and connect with him.

182
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,317
We were cracking that code,
that was the first time...

183
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,486
...that we were on the same page.

184
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,614
Then bond with him on some
non-mysterious island, like Hawaii.

185
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,492
Ah, Hawaii. Our honeymoon.

186
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,245
Aloha oe

187
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,248
Yes, but I'm serious, babe.

188
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,416
I'm serious too.

189
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,792
We'll fly down to Palau.

190
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,295
When Sean realizes the island's not real,
his grandfather's not there...

191
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,632
...I'll be there to cushion the blow,
and done will be done.

192
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,559
Good morning, buddy. 0700 hours.

193
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,518
I'm busy.

194
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,522
I don't think you're gonna be
too busy for this.

195
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,649
I'm going to Palau?

196
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,650
Ha, ha. Close.

197
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,110
We're going to Palau.

198
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,654
What?

199
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,701
I know you've won
the esteemed Rochefort Award...

200
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,954
...but I've been on these adventures before
so let me handle this.

201
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,874
Easy, buddy. Just remember
who's financing this whole trip.

202
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,168
Queen Isabella didn't tag along
with Columbus.

203
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,254
Okay, Isabella. I'll let you handle your thing.
We'll see how...

204
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,131
Wait, watch the lizard. Watch.

205
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,966
Big man's afraid of a little lizard?

206
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,553
Big man's not afraid.
I love lizards when they're boots and belts.

207
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,472
Excuse us.

208
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,849
Hi.

209
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,560
Hey, how's it going? We, uh...

210
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,437
We Americans.

211
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,314
Uh, you...

212
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,148
...tour guide?

213
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,858
- Sean.
- I got this.

214
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,153
You... You take us on boat.

215
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,905
On water.

216
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,448
You wanna charter a boat?

217
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,827
The official language of Palau?

218
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,370
English.

219
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,830
Thank you.

220
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:15,668
Uh, yeah, we need someone to take us
to an island located here.

221
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,463
Absolutely not.

222
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,131
Wait, why?

223
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,759
Because there is no island,
just a bunch of storms.

224
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,302
It's a graveyard for ships.

225
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,387
We'll pay you good money, $1000!

226
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,516
Only a fool trades his life for money.

227
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,104
Excuse me, excuse me.
Today is your lucky day.

228
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,941
Hey, I'm Gabato Laguatan,
best captain in Palau.

229
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,109
I understand you in need
of transportation.

230
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,570
That's great.
We need someone to get us here.

231
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,947
A thousand bucks if you can.

232
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,408
Ooh, baby! Easy-peasy, easy-peasy.
Let's go.

233
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,409
Here we go.

234
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,829
Let's go. Man, this is gonna be...

235
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,622
...good. You won't be disappointed.

236
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,668
I've taken hundreds of people out to sea.
I come back with them almost every time.

237
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,253
- Nice ride.
- Nice ride.

238
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,297
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

239
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,137
What in the blue heck is that?

240
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,849
That's the finest helicopter in Palau.

241
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,766
Hate to see the worst.

242
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,269
Oh!

243
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,437
That's my security system.
Heh, heh.

244
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,649
- I'd rather take the Titanic.
- Kailani!

245
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,317
We have customers here.

246
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,111
You simply must meet my daughter.

247
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,404
She's a real beauty.

248
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,656
Looks just like me.

249
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,048
This chopper's not gonna work out.

250
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,050
Actually, Hank, you know what?

251
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,761
Now that I get a better look at it,
this chopper's...

252
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,430
...pretty freaking gorgeous.

253
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,057
This daughter looks like you?

254
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,602
Look. Same nostrils.

255
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,062
- Who are these guys?
- Uh...

256
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,649
I am a scientific explorer. Hi.

257
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,610
And he's a...

258
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,153
- Hank.
- Hank.

259
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,032
Right. So we need to get
to these coordinates.

260
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,744
Not on this helicopter.

261
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,914
That's the deadliest part of the ocean.

262
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,540
Time-out. Sweetness, sweetness.

263
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,708
Sweetness, look.

264
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,545
They agreed to pay us
1000 American dollars, okay?

265
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,214
I could help with college for you then.

266
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,510
Make it 2000.

267
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,471
No way. We had a deal.

268
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,141
Then make it 3000. And good luck
finding someone else to take you there.

269
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,977
Please?

270
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,483
Do you take Visa?

271
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,696
Good afternoon, folks,
and welcome to Gabato Luxury Tours.

272
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,116
Please sit back, relax
and get ready for the ride of a lifetime.

273
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,452
And now a word from our pilot.

274
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,454
This is your pilot, and...

275
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,582
Here we go.

276
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,127
Gotcha!

277
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,471
If you look out your window
on your left...

278
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,723
...you will see what is known...

279
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,226
...as the Pacific Ocean.

280
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,104
On your right side, you will see...

281
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,857
...the other side of the Pacific Ocean.
- You gonna do that the whole trip?

282
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,861
Sir, you did pay for the luxury tour.

283
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,165
- It's a beautiful sky, huh?
- Mm-hm.

284
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,752
I mean, today just seems especially...

285
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,629
...majestic.

286
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,132
"Majestic"?

287
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,467
Really?

288
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,222
- I have to finish this in-flight safety check.
- Yeah.

289
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,150
We have to go around the storm.

290
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,069
Uh, according to these coordinates,
that's where the island is.

291
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,988
There is no island there.

292
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,240
We're about to find out.

293
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,138
Whoa.

294
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,979
We gotta get out of here now!

295
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,814
I was thinking the same thing!

296
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,441
No, no, no. Wait!

297
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,569
The Mysterious Island, chapter one!

298
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,403
"The passengers...

299
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,614
...had been taken into...

300
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,157
...the movement
of a column of air."

301
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:00,703
We're about to fly into a Category 5 hurricane!
Now's not the time to take the book literally!

302
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,082
We have to go into the eye
of the hurricane to get to the island!

303
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,125
Are you psychotic? We'll never survive!

304
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,502
We gotta trust Verne!

305
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,713
You know what I trust? Gravity.
Gabato, get us out of here now!

306
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,508
You're right, I agree with you.
But here's the deal:

307
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,968
I'm not flying this helicopter anymore!

308
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:16,886
The throttle's...

309
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:17,720
...broken!

310
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,472
What?

311
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,606
We're going down!

312
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,024
Hold on!

313
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,821
Here we go!

314
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,040
No! Not like this!

315
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,805
Hang on! Hang on!

316
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,233
Sean!

317
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,235
Sean!

318
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,653
Come on, buddy.

319
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,988
Come on.

320
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,160
It's okay. It's okay.

321
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,078
Try and sit up.

322
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,414
Attaboy.

323
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,627
I told you it'd work.

324
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,129
You were right.

325
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,381
I can't believe we made it.

326
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,050
It's Jules Verne, man.

327
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,385
You gotta believe.

328
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,263
Where are we?

329
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,433
Where's my father?

330
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,019
Somebody help me!

331
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,438
Help me!

332
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,774
My body's been cut in half!

333
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,234
Your foot's right there.

334
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,613
My severed foot.

335
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,366
And it's moving!

336
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,161
It's moving.

337
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:12,668
Oh, and I'm still in one piece. Yay.

338
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,087
Well, you were right.
There is an island.

339
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,757
Not much of one.

340
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,763
- This is not what I was expecting.
- All right, guys, listen up.

341
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:28,059
We have to gather up everything that
washed ashore and take stock of our supplies.

342
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,977
We need to find shelter. Let's go.

343
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,244
There you are, baby. I thought I lost you.

344
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,954
Oh...

345
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,750
Oh, yeah. My girl.

346
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,356
Hey, I think I found
a way off the beach!

347
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,625
What was that?

348
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,713
It's a scary noise in a dark cave.
Keep moving. Keep moving. Go, go.

349
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,871
If this is heaven, I'm checking in.

350
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,625
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

351
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,837
The Mysterious Island.

352
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,355
What is this place?

353
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,316
Whoa!

354
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,485
This island, it shrunk us!

355
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,833
Or turned us into giants?

356
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,298
Sean, what does Verne say
about this?

357
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,801
It's one of the first laws
of island biogeography.

358
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,929
Small animals become large
and large animals become small.

359
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,140
Lilliputian. Swift alluded to it
in Gulliver's Travels.

360
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,602
I'd like to keep him as a pet.
I could knit him a little trunk-warmer.

361
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,317
See you, buddy.

362
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,861
Hey, check it out.
You guys see that smoke?

363
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,864
- That's gotta be my grandpa's campsite.
- How do you know?

364
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,366
What else could it be?

365
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:34,161
The natives sparking up a barbecue,
getting ready to cook us for dinner.

366
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,496
Only one way to find out.

367
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,705
Whoa, time-out!

368
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,876
I hope your grandfather's okay,
but my father and I aren't going.

369
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,421
- We're headed back to the beach.
- To do what?

370
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,341
Spell SOS with seashells
and maybe kelp.

371
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,053
Kelp? There's a boat-eating,
plane-eating hurricane out there 24/7.

372
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,721
Nobody's gonna see your kelp.

373
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,265
Sean's absolutely right.

374
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,893
We stick together, find his grandfather,
use his radio to call for help.

375
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,272
Fine.

376
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,484
Just know that if we get torn to bits,
I'm blaming you.

377
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,612
I'm blaming you too.

378
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,740
Real smooth.

379
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,411
What did I do?

380
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,747
Seriously, what did I say?
What did I do?

381
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,870
SPF 100?

382
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,955
You squeeze it
and a sweater comes out?

383
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,707
Yeah, that's funny, Navy man.

384
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,877
Don't come crying to me
when you're as red as a tomato.

385
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,880
Do I look like I burn?

386
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,598
Oh, man...

387
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,933
...that's one gooey rock.

388
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,229
No one move.

389
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,690
These aren't rocks.

390
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,319
They're eggs.

391
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,829
Get out. Why don't we crack
a couple open and make some omelets?

392
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,956
Not a good idea.

393
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,416
Come on, man,
I haven't had breakfast yet.

394
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:48,170
Shh! Where there are giant eggs,
there must be a giant mother.

395
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,847
It had to be a lizard.
Why couldn't it be snakes?

396
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,600
Okay.

397
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,103
Okay, we just need to move quickly
but carefully.

398
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,314
Lizards have incredible hearing
and an acute sense of smell.

399
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,404
Uh-oh.

400
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,907
Let's move. Just move.

401
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,459
We are literally walking on eggshells.

402
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,302
Ooh!

403
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,602
Guys?

404
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,479
Don't take another step.

405
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,568
Papa, be careful.

406
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,737
Don't worry, honey.

407
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,447
I got this.

408
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,115
See? No problem. Oh!

409
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,328
Oh, man!

410
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,680
Run, run, run!

411
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,438
Head for the jungle!

412
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,773
Faster! Faster!

413
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,608
Let's go! Go! Go!

414
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,443
Move!

415
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,365
Come on!

416
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,077
This way!

417
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:44,662
Let's go!

418
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,959
Go, go, go! Move!

419
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,586
It's right behind you! Hurry!

420
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,712
Come on!

421
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,422
Sean!

422
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,011
Hey, Godzilla!

423
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,263
Oh, crap.

424
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,556
Oh, man!

425
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,433
Oh, go, go, go!

426
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,835
Come on, come on!

427
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,005
- Come on, keep moving!
- Hurry!

428
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,761
Back! Back! Back!

429
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,888
Sean, get behind me.

430
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,307
Sean, backpack!

431
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,105
Back! Back!

432
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,565
- Hank! Hank!
- Back!

433
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,066
Not now, Sean. She's scared!

434
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,569
No, she's cold-blooded
and attracted to heat!

435
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,031
That's emasculating.

436
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,202
Now what?

437
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,248
Now there's only one thing left.

438
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,543
The thunder cookie.

439
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,465
I think I just made it worse.

440
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,050
- Whoa!
- Aah!

441
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,012
Hope she doesn't like
Polynesian food.

442
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,515
I hope she don't like food
with poop in its pants!

443
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,206
Go, go, go!

444
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,432
Everybody okay?

445
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,350
Yeah.

446
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,066
Well, don't just stand there. Applaud!

447
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,029
Grandpa!

448
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,282
That was amazing.

449
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:33,372
A pitch-perfect frill-necked lizard mating call.
They fall for it all the time.

450
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,665
Gabato and Kailani.

451
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,085
- Their helicopter brought us here.
- Pleasure. Pleasure.

452
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,128
And I'm Sean's stepfather,
Hank Parsons.

453
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,172
I helped Sean crack your code.

454
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,590
You're the stepfather?

455
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,176
Well, maybe that's why
it took so long, eh?

456
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,054
After all, how hard can it be
to crack a code...

457
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:53,892
...by converting a string of Vernian
characters into a list of dots and dashes.

458
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,478
Or you could have just sent a message
not in code.

459
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,733
There it is, definitive proof
that you are not an Anderson.

460
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,818
Mm-hm.

461
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:03,694
Ooh. Ooh!

462
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,198
I think it's best we get out of here.

463
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,326
After that mating call, she may have ideas
about making you her husband.

464
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,496
Oh, witty. Good for you, Henry.

465
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,543
The name's Hank. It's never Henry.
Just Hank.

466
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,839
Ah. I see you're a man of incisive decision.
Why don't you lead the way?

467
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,591
Oh, actually...

468
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,010
...we want to live
through the night. Yes.

469
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,636
So maybe you should all...

470
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,347
...follow me. Come on.

471
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,726
Hank?

472
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,270
I'm following you.

473
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,315
All right, come on. Go ahead.

474
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,249
That's awesome.

475
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,223
Here we are, folks.

476
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,059
Come on up.

477
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,312
This is my place.

478
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,402
Wow.

479
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,237
Welcome.

480
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,616
We've got a working elevator,
indoor plumbing.

481
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,244
And I've even got...

482
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,080
...a 75-inch...

483
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,708
...HDTV.

484
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,794
How'd you build all this stuff?

485
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:48,298
I made it out of the sailboat that brought
me here. Old Blue-Eyed Lucy.

486
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,927
She gave her life in that hurricane
so that I could discover...

487
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,762
...the ever-glorious...

488
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,349
...Mysterious Island.

489
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,603
Smoothie?

490
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,855
Oh, thank you.

491
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,983
This the radio you used
to send the signal?

492
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,734
Yes. I made it myself...

493
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,528
...out of an alarm clock...

494
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,698
...some copper I mined in the hills
over there and a teaspoon.

495
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,033
You know how long it took me
to make it?

496
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,536
Oh, I don't know.
Probably a little less than...

497
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,495
...who cares?

498
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,497
Three months. You know how long...

499
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,040
...it would've taken you?

500
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,917
Ooh...

501
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,627
Forever. Ha-ha-ha!

502
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,129
Let's just contact...

503
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,672
...Palau, get off this island.

504
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,134
It's not that easy, darling.
You have to wait for the satellite...

505
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,511
...to come around to the proper position.

506
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,929
How long's that gonna take?

507
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,806
Oh, about two weeks.

508
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,475
Wait, do you mean
we're stuck here for two weeks?

509
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:44,855
"Stuck here"? I think it'll be fun.
We can get to know each other better.

510
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,108
Surviving here won't be fun.

511
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,653
How will your mom feel
if we're off the grid for two weeks?

512
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,656
By the time you get back,
she's probably gonna be remarried.

513
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,784
You gonna let him talk to you like that?

514
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,119
It's okay.

515
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,040
Okay, so, what's the plan,
Colonel Sanders?

516
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,333
How about you show us
more of your trinkets...

517
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,627
...that won't get us off this island?

518
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,880
Anyone else thinking about
the eggs hatching?

519
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,633
If you're afraid of a few critters,
maybe you shouldn't have come, Henry.

520
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,927
It is called the Mysterious Island.

521
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,930
Should've expected mysterious things.
It's right in the title.

522
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,390
I know what the book says.

523
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,310
You wanted to find Mysterious Island.
Mission accomplished.

524
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,312
You wanted to find your grandmother.

525
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,688
Mission accomplished.

526
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,692
At daybreak we're out of here.
And for the last time, it's Hank.

527
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,652
What's the hurry?

528
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,948
Tomorrow, I am gonna
show you a place...

529
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,742
...that will take your breath away.

530
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,285
Like forever?

531
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,871
You're all gonna find out.

532
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,040
So let's get some shut-eye.

533
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,252
It's a big day tomorrow.

534
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,216
Good nighty, honey.

535
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,426
- Good night, Papa.
- Good nighty.

536
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,453
Hey, how's it going?

537
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,748
Well, apart from you stranding us
on this stupid island, just fine.

538
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,291
Good. Good.

539
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,963
So, hey, I was thinking, you know,
sometime we could hang out or something...

540
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,172
...if you wanted to.

541
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,718
I have a feeling that your idea of fun and
my idea of fun are two very different things.

542
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,096
What do you like doing on the weekends?

543
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,848
Collect and label mollusks.

544
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,016
No way! Me too. I'm way into mollusks.

545
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:45,851
- Really?
- Yeah.

546
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:49,479
Well, which one's your favorite?
Mine's the Mxyzptlk snail.

547
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,191
You're not gonna believe me,
but that's my favorite too.

548
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,235
I just made that up.

549
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,238
Mxyzptlk isn't a snail.

550
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,283
It's one of Superman's archenemies.

551
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,748
Way to slay the heart.

552
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,334
- Whatever.
- Getting the attention of a woman...

553
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,211
...is one of the hardest things
to do.

554
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,130
All right.

555
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,966
So, what do I do, Casanova?

556
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:26,016
I been waiting a long time
to have this talk with you, buddy.

557
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,060
There are three things to know
about understanding girls.

558
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,230
Don't follow your instincts.

559
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,441
Any other area in life...

560
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,402
...instincts will get you there.
Not with women.

561
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,280
So whatever you think you should do,
do the opposite.

562
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,491
You need to be open, sensitive.

563
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:48,330
Women don't want a man just because
he's big and strong and has abs like mine. No.

564
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:52,334
They want a thinker, they want a feeler.
They want someone who can understand them.

565
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,588
Women want a man who is in touch
with his most inner emotions.

566
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,965
And the third thing is the most important.

567
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,470
It's something that women have
responded to for thousands of years.

568
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,430
Well, tell me.

569
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,225
You have got to do this.

570
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,814
What is that?

571
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,568
That is the pec pop of love.
Now go on and throw a berry.

572
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,237
- No.
- Throw a berry.

573
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,572
There's some behind you.
Grab one and throw it.

574
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,616
Don't be afraid, they're not gonna bite.

575
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,371
Boom.

576
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,209
Go ahead, grab a bunch.
Rapid-fire, now.

577
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,627
I'm not doing rapid-fire.

578
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,712
They will not stop until you feed them.

579
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,172
Feed them? No.

580
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,257
They're hungry.

581
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,216
I'll feed them.

582
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,300
Attaboy. Get some.

583
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,594
Okay, you ready? Ready?
Here we go.

584
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,679
Ooh. Ooh.

585
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,555
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

586
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,515
Ooh. Ooh.

587
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,267
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

588
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,101
Stop.

589
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,477
Ready? This one's special.

590
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,812
Make this one count.

591
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,192
Mmm. No way, that's awesome.

592
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,027
Stop encouraging him.

593
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,904
It's a gift.

594
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,073
- It is a gift.
- He has a gift.

595
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,242
Sean, it works every time.

596
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,705
Come on, Gabby.
Get a move on.

597
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,331
Where's he going?

598
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,668
I don't know, but if this goes on
much longer, he'll blow a hip. Come on.

599
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,336
Oh! I'm going.

600
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,799
Come on, come on.
We're almost there.

601
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,682
Get ready, Gabby.
I'm about to take your breath away.

602
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,728
Wow!

603
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,608
Unbelievable.

604
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,207
How do you like Grandma now?

605
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,673
Hello!

606
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,594
No one's been home
for thousands of years, Gabby.

607
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,155
Can anybody guess...

608
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,284
...what all this is?

609
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,997
Do you know?

610
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:38,833
Legoland?

611
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,251
No.

612
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,253
Well, that's Poseidon.

613
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,262
- Can you move this?
- Yeah.

614
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:02,857
Atlantis.

615
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,401
I can't believe it.

616
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,736
We're standing in
the lost city of Atlantis.

617
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:10,490
The same Atlantis that Verne
wrote about, down to the last detail.

618
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,367
But wasn't Atlantis underwater?

619
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,746
Oh, when Verne wrote about it, it was,
but it has a 140-year cycle...

620
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,165
...and spends half its time
above the water.

621
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,168
- What about the other half?
- It's called tectonic recurrence.

622
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,671
The ocean bed buckles
due to volcanic activity...

623
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,464
...pulling land to the surface.

624
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:32,929
Then the entire island
sinks back to the bottom of the sea.

625
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,098
Nobody's ever seen it
on this big of a scale.

626
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,433
This is amazing.

627
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,767
Come with me.

628
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:46,443
I've been looking for this
piece of paradise for 30 years.

629
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:50,947
I promised your old man
that we'd find it together.

630
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,616
But he's not here to enjoy it...

631
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:58,037
...so I made sure that his son would be.

632
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,999
That is why I encoded that message.

633
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,836
I wanted an Anderson to see this place...

634
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,213
...before anyone else.

635
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:12,510
Some men get to put their names
on stars, species...

636
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,013
...plants. We get to put our name...

637
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,516
...on this gorgeous island.

638
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,312
In two weeks, we'll contact the authorities
to pick us up...

639
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,648
...and in three weeks, we'll be
on the cover of TIME magazine.

640
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,483
Guys.

641
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,276
We got a problem.

642
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,694
What?

643
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,696
You see this? It's saltwater.

644
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:35,617
The only way saltwater gets this far inland
is if it enters the subsoil from below.

645
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,493
So?

646
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,161
This island's about to go under.

647
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,705
The only saltwater here
is on your brain.

648
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,832
I've analyzed the samples...

649
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,876
...and I've calculated the numbers.

650
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,087
This island isn't due to sink
for 14 years.

651
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,964
Alexander, your numbers are wrong.

652
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,926
- And how would you know that?
- I've come across this...

653
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,179
...as we build over runoff areas.
It's called soil liquefaction.

654
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:00,683
Look, you can see it in the cracks in the
confining beds all along here, along here...

655
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,812
...over there, back here.

656
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,856
Okay, you made your point.

657
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,025
Well, how long do we have?

658
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,362
If I had to guess,
based on all this water...

659
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,781
...two, three days max.

660
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,576
Then what? Because I ain't
no flotation device, man.

661
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,328
You will be,
we don't figure this out.

662
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,330
There must be some way
off this island.

663
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,665
We could build a boat.

664
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,376
The storm around this island
will chew it up, spit it out.

665
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,086
I've got something.

666
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,379
What about the Nautilus?

667
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,549
How is an exercise machine
gonna help us get out of here?

668
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,010
No, no, the Nautilus.
Captain Nemo's submarine, built in 1870.

669
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,178
Well done, Sean.

670
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:42,559
Chapter 16, Verne wrote
it is hidden on the island.

671
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,729
If we can make it there in time, we can
ride it under the hurricane back to Palau.

672
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,982
Okay. One question:

673
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,066
Where is it?

674
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,445
There's only one man
who can tell us that...

675
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:58,324
...and that is Captain Nemo himself.

676
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,377
The Dakkar Grotto.

677
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,963
The final resting place of Captain Nemo.

678
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,965
Legend has it
his crew buried him there.

679
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,801
I'll tell you what had better be in there:

680
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,386
Nemo's journal.

681
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,764
It could tell us the location
of the Nautilus.

682
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:26,227
I've never been able to crawl in there
on my own. Too many fried eggs, I'm afraid.

683
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,272
I'll go.

684
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,357
I'm the only one who can fit.

685
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,067
No way. It's too dangerous.

686
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,902
Sweet, but I don't need
your permission.

687
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,410
Honey?

688
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,330
- Papa loves you.
- You remember the drill.

689
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,957
Be careful.
Who knows what's down there.

690
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,669
Honey? Honey? You okay?!

691
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,463
I'm fine.

692
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,512
I'm inside!

693
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:56,818
What was that?

694
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,446
So that's what a sinking island
sounds like.

695
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,875
Hank!

696
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:14,961
Hurry!

697
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,715
Pull her out! Pull her out!

698
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,098
Hi.

699
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,644
Man, that guy had some
terrible handwriting.

700
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,188
- Looks like Sanskrit.
- Close. It's Hindi.

701
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,732
Yeah, Nemo's from India.

702
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,400
It says here...

703
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,736
...that the Nautilus is in a basalt...

704
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,697
...cave on the other side
of the island, just...

705
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,615
...under Poseidon's Cliffs.

706
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,452
I know...

707
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,411
...this place.

708
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,954
That's where we gotta go.

709
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,414
What's the best way there?

710
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,999
Well, now, that depends.

711
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,793
The safest way
is around the shoreline...

712
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,838
...but the fastest way
is across the heart of the island.

713
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,631
What do you think, Hank?

714
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,426
- I think we got no choice. The quickest way.
- He's right.

715
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,802
- I'm in.
- Yeah, but...

716
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,304
...let me warn you.

717
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,389
The heart of this island...

718
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,519
...is full of jagged mountains,
dark jungles and terrifying creatures...

719
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,022
...who will give you nightmares.

720
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,440
So...

721
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,567
...who's up for an adventure?

722
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,871
Are we there yet?

723
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,707
We get there when we get there, Gabby.

724
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,711
What was that?

725
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,849
The tectonic plates are starting
to pull apart underneath the island.

726
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,059
We gotta move.
Let's go. Move.

727
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,686
Move.

728
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,862
Wait, what is that?

729
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,953
Volcanic ash?

730
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,663
It looks like...

731
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,290
Gold.

732
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,919
Pure gold.

733
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,420
The treasure Stevenson...

734
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,255
...talked about in Treasure Island.

735
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,635
Volcanoes are made of what they erupt.
So if that thing's erupting gold, then it's...

736
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,470
A mountain of gold.

737
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,847
Must be massive gold deposits.

738
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,390
Let's go check it out.

739
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,019
Hold on. That'll take us days
out of our way. We don't have the time.

740
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:04,273
Let's make the time. Volcanic gold?
That's a huge scientific breakthrough.

741
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,192
I understand,
but we gotta get to the Nautilus.

742
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,987
Hank, I'm not just a little kid. Okay?
I get a say in this too.

743
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,908
Sean, I am responsible for you.
I'd never take a chance with your life.

744
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,827
Hey, hey, you can't tell him what to do.

745
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,996
- You're not his father.
- From what I hear...

746
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,748
...you haven't been
much of a grandfather.

747
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,250
I have given him something to live up to.

748
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,587
Science, adventure, wonder.

749
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,130
What have you ever given him?

750
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,884
I've given him a lot of things,
a sense of responsibility being one of them.

751
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,971
Something clearly you don't have.

752
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,348
You're not going.

753
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,934
We're getting out of here.
End of discussion.

754
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:45,064
Sean, please.
We have to get off this island.

755
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,494
Bye-bye, gold.

756
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,862
Hey, you okay?

757
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,989
Yeah. Fine.

758
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:39,201
It's just, you know, I don't need Hank
trying to tell me what to do all the time.

759
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:43,456
My dad's always trying to get involved too,
but he usually ends up embarrassing me.

760
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,707
Yeah? How?

761
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,751
Last summer I was trying to get a job...

762
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:51,338
...so he flew all over Palau dropping thousands
of copies of my résumé from his helicopter.

763
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,634
That's embarrassing.
Isn't that the worst when they try so hard?

764
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,345
No.

765
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,433
I mean, the worst would be
if they didn't try at all.

766
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,281
Alexander, are you sure
your compass readings are correct?

767
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,743
- Of course I am. Why?
- Why? Because we're down here...

768
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,789
...and we need to be all the way up there.
- To every problem, there is...

769
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,874
...a solution, my large friend...

770
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:30,544
...and I think this might be a fun one.

771
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:33,047
You think this might be a fun one, eh?

772
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,841
Does anybody have an umbrella?

773
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,677
Because Mary Poppins is gonna
fly us up to the top of the cliff.

774
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,639
I knew you'd be good for something.

775
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,557
Better wait here, Henry.

776
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,187
Where's he going?

777
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,523
I don't know,
but that guy's out of his mind.

778
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,566
Whoa! Ha, ha!

779
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,318
Oh, I most certainly am.

780
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:59,740
It turns out that mounting the bee is easy
if you don't look into its eyes.

781
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,909
That is so sick.

782
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,203
Okay.

783
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,287
You get down now.

784
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,123
Why would I get down?

785
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:11,210
Well, because Medicare doesn't cover
old ladies falling off of giant bees. Get down.

786
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,753
Suit yourself.

787
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:17,675
But make sure you're wearing swimming trunks
when this place becomes the Pacific Ocean.

788
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:18,926
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!

789
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:23,764
Sean.

790
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,147
Can we fly together?

791
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,723
This is amazing!

792
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:10,352
Like riding stallions
across the Serengeti.

793
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:20,196
This is beautiful! Talk about paradise!

794
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:24,909
Oh, man.

795
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,328
- Is that...?
- Bird poop?

796
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,872
Oh! Oh!

797
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,290
That must be one giant...

798
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,043
Bird!

799
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,506
Into the trees!

800
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,263
That thing looks hungry!

801
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,890
A white-throated needletail.

802
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,683
It feeds on worms, aphids...

803
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,143
...and, yes, bees!

804
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,396
There's another one!

805
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,744
Hold on!

806
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,294
Watch out!

807
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:35,771
Hey!

808
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,648
Stay in your own lane!

809
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,693
Are you familiar with Chicken?

810
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,361
These aren't chickens!

811
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,613
No, the game! Chicken!

812
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:45,698
Oh!

813
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,491
I like the way he thinks.

814
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,659
Charge!

815
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,006
Not yet.

816
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,633
Not yet!

817
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:08,012
Now!

818
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:08,929
Oh!

819
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,733
Yeah! How cool was that, little buddy?

820
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,361
I love you, Hank! I love you so much!

821
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,738
I love you...

822
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,948
Too much happy.
That's too much happy.

823
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:28,949
Hold on!

824
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,140
Kailani!

825
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,455
You saved me.

826
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,166
Yeah, I guess I did.

827
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:21,668
Or maybe not!

828
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,465
Go, go! Get out of here!

829
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,305
Sean, what are you doing?

830
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,683
Come on, bird!

831
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,155
Let's do this!

832
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,706
Yes!

833
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:02,668
Aah!

834
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,599
Sean. Talk to me.

835
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,561
It's my ankle. I can't move it.

836
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,771
This could be serious.
I need to look at it.

837
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:23,772
Not here.

838
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,483
This part of town
is even more dangerous after dark.

839
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:30,028
Okay. I'm gonna get you up,
on three.

840
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,031
One, two, three. Up.

841
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,575
That's it.

842
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,618
Give me your arm. Okay.

843
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,328
Now come on.

844
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,143
Has the swelling gone down?

845
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,480
It's dislocated pretty bad.
We might be here a while.

846
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,357
Well, we'll go get some water.

847
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,488
We're gonna have to
pop it back in, buddy.

848
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,991
Okay. Let's do it.

849
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,827
Alexander, I'll brace him.
You do it on three?

850
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:19,661
Got it.

851
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:23,624
- Ready?
- Yeah.

852
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,625
One...

853
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,376
Aah!

854
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,880
- What happened to two and three?
- Yeah.

855
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,548
Two, three.

856
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:33,675
Wasn't so bad.

857
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,093
It wasn't very good.

858
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,846
Do we have anything for the pain?

859
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,433
There's nothing in here.

860
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,188
All right, buddy.

861
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:49,066
There you go. Okay.

862
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,817
Attaboy.

863
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:53,487
We have this.

864
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,533
No, no, no.

865
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,745
Don't worry. I don't sing to dudes
underneath the stars in front of a cozy fire.

866
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,288
- It's not my style.
- Good.

867
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,623
You can sing?

868
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:05,749
A little bit.

869
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:06,959
Brilliant.

870
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:10,212
Music is nature's painkiller.
Sing him a song.

871
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,713
- No.
- Yeah.

872
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,550
Come on.

873
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,134
Okay.

874
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:17,928
Don't worry.

875
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,346
I got something special for you.

876
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,143
God!

877
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,812
All right.

878
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,319
Oh, that's gonna make me feel better?

879
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:37,364
Slow it down. Just gotta get in tune.

880
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,491
Takes a big man to play a little guitar.

881
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,243
And an even bigger one to listen.

882
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:47,291
I see trees of green

883
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,210
Red roses too

884
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,213
I see them bloom

885
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,300
For me and for you

886
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,218
And I think to

887
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,803
Myself

888
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:05,434
What a wonderful world

889
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,941
I see giant bees and

890
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,526
I could have told ya

891
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:18,447
Don't trust Alexander

892
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,117
He's older than Yoda

893
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,535
And I think

894
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,329
To myself

895
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,918
What a wonderful world

896
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,423
The island

897
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,050
That we stand on

898
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:41,094
Well, it's currently sinking

899
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,722
Sending those secret codes

900
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,433
What the heck were you drinking?

901
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:47,601
But it's

902
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,103
All in the past

903
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:52,939
We wiped the slate clean

904
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,984
We're going to find

905
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,903
Nemo's

906
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,738
Submarine

907
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:06,328
And you'll think to yourself

908
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,624
What a wonderful

909
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,459
World

910
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,881
Oh, yeah

911
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,301
Oh, that was extraordinary.

912
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,678
What, my multiple talents?

913
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:26,181
No, after all these years,
finding the elusive singing Sasquatch.

914
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:32,688
No, but seriously,
where'd you learn to play like that?

915
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,273
My dad used to sing it to me
when I was a kid.

916
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,775
Ah.

917
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,569
Remind me to buy him a drink
when we get back.

918
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,530
Yeah. Good luck finding him.

919
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,033
Why?

920
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,118
Where is he?

921
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,578
Don't know.

922
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,333
He left when I was 8,
and I haven't seen him since.

923
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,174
At least I got a good song
out of it, right?

924
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,718
Yeah.

925
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,229
You like him, don't you?

926
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,565
Who, Sean? No.

927
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:23,447
Yeah, he's a little hotheaded, you know.
But he seems to be a good kid.

928
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,657
It can never happen between us.

929
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:29,244
I mean, if we get off this island,
he'll go back to America...

930
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,872
...move on with his life
and go to college.

931
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,790
And I'll go back to tiny Palau.

932
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,919
You could go to college someday
if that's something you really want.

933
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,421
Who's gonna help you at work?

934
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,173
Plus we can't afford it.

935
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:45,051
Don't say that. You wanna
go to college, you can go to college.

936
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,012
Okay? I can make that happen.

937
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,266
I promise.

938
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,227
Thanks, Papa.

939
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,126
Hank.

940
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,253
Hank, get up.

941
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,464
Something's wrong here.
Everybody up!

942
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,424
Where'd this water come from?

943
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,426
The liquefaction rate tripled overnight.

944
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:27,928
What's that mean?

945
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,055
It's sinking a lot faster
than we thought.

946
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,932
I thought you said a couple of days.

947
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:34,601
- Now more like a couple of hours.
- A couple of hours?

948
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:38,230
We need to get to that sub or
we'll all be 20,000 leagues under the sea.

949
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,191
Papa?

950
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:46,530
Papa?

951
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:48,031
Papa!

952
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,408
- He's gone.
- Stay calm.

953
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,369
He's probably gone for a pee.

954
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,581
Oh, no. Oh, no.

955
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:57,415
What?

956
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:01,044
Ugh. Last night, he promised me
he'd send me to college.

957
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:04,214
Now I know what he meant.
He's going after the mountain of gold.

958
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,091
Look, I gotta go get him.

959
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,761
You guys head to the sub. If we're
not there in time, leave without us.

960
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,638
No way. You're not going alone.

961
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:12,889
I'll go with you.

962
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,975
You have a dislocated ankle,
that's four miles.

963
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:16,977
It's fine. I can do it. It'll be okay.

964
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:20,939
No, Sean, he's right.
You're in no condition to make that trip.

965
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,899
Well, she can't go alone.

966
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,568
Then I'll go with her.

967
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:26,278
I'm the one who...

968
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,238
...called you to this island.

969
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,199
It's my fault you're in this quagmire.

970
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,660
If this map of ours is right...

971
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,872
...then the Trident Cliffs
should be about...

972
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,041
...a mile and a half in that direction.

973
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:43,753
You get to the Nautilus as soon as you can
and then meet us...

974
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,797
...on the shoreline.
- We have one map.

975
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,757
Let me see your phone.

976
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,388
Let me see this thing.

977
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:56,766
Now we have two.

978
01:04:57,476 --> 01:05:00,228
Hank, well done.

979
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,813
Thank you...

980
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,023
...for calling me Hank.

981
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:05,483
Anytime.

982
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:08,987
Be careful.

983
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,907
Come on, darling.

984
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,452
I'll see you soon.

985
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,828
I promise.

986
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:25,837
Ready, Sean?

987
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,215
Yeah.

988
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:32,886
Come on.

989
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,233
Ow! Ooh!

990
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,485
Oh, not that there! Ow!

991
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:49,653
That hurt too!

992
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,705
Gold.

993
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:04,042
Our prayers have been answered.

994
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:24,938
There's Poseidon's...

995
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,565
...Trident, right where
it's supposed to be.

996
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,985
We need the cliff.
This is just shoreline.

997
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:33,321
The Nautilus is supposed to be
inside of a cave right here.

998
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:34,948
Maybe the map is wrong.

999
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,574
Let me see it.

1000
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,706
Sean, we are in the right place.

1001
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,959
Well, then where's the cave?
Where's the Nautilus?

1002
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,335
Down there.

1003
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:50,714
The sea level's risen over 100 feet
in the last 24 hours.

1004
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,718
I can't believe this is happening.
We're too late. It's over.

1005
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:56,970
No, it's not. It's okay. It's okay.

1006
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:00,682
We just gotta think.
We just gotta think of a way to get...

1007
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,434
I got it.

1008
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,352
- What?
- Scuba tanks.

1009
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,646
Are we listing things
that we don't have?

1010
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:09,774
Okay, a jet pack, a girlfriend,
calligraphy paper.

1011
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,526
No, no, listen to me. We just...

1012
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:12,861
"Calligraphy paper"?

1013
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,070
It popped into my head.

1014
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:16,364
- We have a couple of dry bags, right?
- Yeah.

1015
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:20,910
Okay, so we take what we salvaged from
the beach, and we build makeshift scuba tanks.

1016
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,746
No short breaths...

1017
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,539
...no wasted movements.

1018
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,042
Make sure you equalize ear pressure
as you go down.

1019
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:29,044
You know...

1020
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,795
...if we die down there...

1021
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,839
...Mom's gonna kill us.

1022
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,133
Then let's do this.

1023
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,902
Papa?

1024
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,112
Papa.

1025
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:05,080
What are you doing here? You're supposed to
be back at the Nautilus. I'll meet you...

1026
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,122
...back there.

1027
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,791
Papa, stop.

1028
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:09,834
Stop.

1029
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,544
Papa, stop!

1030
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:16,382
Baby, this is our one chance.
Our one chance to send you to college.

1031
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,886
To give you a different life, a better life.

1032
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,764
Papa.

1033
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:26,309
We'll have all the wealth
we'll ever need...

1034
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,438
...just as long as we're together.

1035
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,317
Let's go home.

1036
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,402
All right. All right.

1037
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,905
Okay.

1038
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,865
Double-time, Gabby.

1039
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:53,461
Okay, it's only 100 feet down,
and we've got two hits of air with this.

1040
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:54,462
Right.

1041
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,841
- Are you ready?
- Am I ready? Are you ready?

1042
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,385
- Oh, I'm totally ready.
- Well, I'm totally ready.

1043
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,387
Well, I'm probably more ready than you.

1044
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,473
No, there's no way.
I'm, like, twice as ready as you are.

1045
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,810
We're procrastinating out of fear,
aren't we?

1046
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,395
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.

1047
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,744
Wait, which way are you going?

1048
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:10,246
Frankly, I'm not sure.

1049
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:12,957
You're not sure?
Look, we're running out of time.

1050
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,334
Well, which way's north?

1051
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:15,752
Uh...

1052
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:19,756
This way. No.

1053
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,132
No.

1054
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,885
No, that's not it. It's this way.

1055
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,640
We're getting too much
magnetic friction.

1056
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,016
What does that mean?

1057
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,976
It means we're lost.

1058
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,567
We made it.

1059
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,486
The Nautilus.

1060
01:12:06,363 --> 01:12:07,739
Come on.

1061
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,249
Sean, give me the flashlight.

1062
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,402
Let's power this up
and get to the others.

1063
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:53,493
How do we find north
without a compass?

1064
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,578
Spiders.

1065
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,622
Oh, oh... Heh, heh.

1066
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:01,209
I already rode a giant bee.
I ain't getting on no spider.

1067
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:03,920
Spiders build their webs...

1068
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:06,464
...facing south.

1069
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:08,966
Uh, guys?

1070
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:11,094
I think I found our spider.

1071
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,013
Oh!

1072
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,476
And we go the other way.

1073
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:30,530
The ballast control panel's
gotta be around here somewhere.

1074
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:33,116
Where's the power switch?

1075
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:43,543
I think this is it.

1076
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:45,795
How do you know?

1077
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,422
It's right there in chapter 17.

1078
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,298
Someone's reading their Verne.

1079
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,176
Let's fire this baby up.

1080
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:02,895
Come on, come on. Wake up!

1081
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:10,278
The engine's dead.
We gotta get under the hood.

1082
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,419
These batteries are 140 years old.

1083
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,256
It's gonna need a jump-start.

1084
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:33,301
Yeah, but that's gonna take
thousands of kilowatts of electricity.

1085
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:41,684
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1086
01:14:42,352 --> 01:14:43,853
That's completely insane.

1087
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:45,813
Exactly.

1088
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,661
- Cable attached to the harpoon?
- Yeah.

1089
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:04,582
Great. One good charge from that thing
out there, we're gonna be on our way.

1090
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,044
Okay. But I need you to come back.

1091
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,713
Of course. Somebody's gotta
help you pilot this thing.

1092
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:12,757
No, I mean...

1093
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:18,513
Look, if anybody ever asks,
I'm gonna deny that I ever said this.

1094
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:21,933
But I need you to come back.

1095
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,770
I've had a lot of people
take off on me in my life...

1096
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,939
...and I don't want you
to be one of them.

1097
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:33,444
Before we left, I told your mom
that I was gonna take care of her son.

1098
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:35,905
You're not just her son.

1099
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,366
You're my family too now.

1100
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,785
I promise you I'll come back for you.

1101
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:43,704
Okay?

1102
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:45,414
Okay.

1103
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:49,710
Now...

1104
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,631
...who's up for an adventure?

1105
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:08,145
Where are they?

1106
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:09,397
They're not here.

1107
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:37,049
Bumpy!

1108
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,177
They'd better get here quick!

1109
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,930
We're running out of real estate!

1110
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:55,901
Hey!

1111
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:57,903
Hey, over here!

1112
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,890
Where are you?

1113
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:42,073
Come on, Hank.

1114
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:43,574
Come on!

1115
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:49,664
Where are you?

1116
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,629
Come on, show me...

1117
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,297
...that 1000-watt smile.

1118
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:02,885
Do it now!

1119
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,183
Yes!

1120
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,040
I love you, Papa.

1121
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,167
I love you, baby.

1122
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:48,389
Down we go!

1123
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:31,766
We made it.

1124
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,350
Not yet, we haven't!

1125
01:19:58,376 --> 01:19:59,043
Up ahead.

1126
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,045
We're gonna be blocked.

1127
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:05,716
Gabato, I need you
to captain us out of here.

1128
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:06,884
Me?

1129
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,428
You brought us to the island,
you can take us back.

1130
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:10,596
Okay.

1131
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,892
Sean, on my signal, hit that button.

1132
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:19,605
Yeah, you right. It's like flying
in my helicopter. Like... Okay.

1133
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:42,419
Hank!

1134
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,465
Hank!

1135
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:49,927
Fire it!

1136
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,710
Hey, hey, man, we did it! We did it!

1137
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:23,586
Yes!

1138
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:26,630
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1139
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,507
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1140
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:31,760
Gabato!

1141
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:48,027
And we're on cruise control.

1142
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:52,781
Nice work, man.

1143
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,199
You too.

1144
01:21:58,538 --> 01:22:00,372
Can't believe
we made it off the island.

1145
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:02,875
Yeah.

1146
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,088
Pop your pecs.

1147
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:11,216
I'm not gonna pop my pecs.

1148
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,636
Now's the time.
She's gonna love it, believe me.

1149
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:16,388
- I'm not gonna pop pecs.
- Do it, do it. You can do it.

1150
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:17,932
She would love it, believe me.

1151
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:19,099
Ahem.

1152
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:20,976
You two done yet?

1153
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,438
Pop your pecs.

1154
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:30,819
Thank you.

1155
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:32,237
For everything.

1156
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:39,203
That works too.

1157
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:40,996
I'm so happy right now.

1158
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:42,498
I don't know how...

1159
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:43,666
...this moment could get better.

1160
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,000
Well, the one way...

1161
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:48,921
...it could get better is if you
steer us away from this coral reef.

1162
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:49,755
Oh! Oh!

1163
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:50,589
Okay.

1164
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:53,342
That's a good idea, good idea.

1165
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:56,971
Good afternoon, folks...

1166
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:59,014
...and welcome to Gabato Luxury Tours.

1167
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:01,100
If you look out the window
on your left...

1168
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:03,310
...you will see what is known
as the Pacific Ocean.

1169
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,437
Ugh. Here we go again.

1170
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,439
- Pass it!
- Car!

1171
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,032
Game on!

1172
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:29,169
For the third time today, Papa, I'm fine.

1173
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:32,673
Yeah, but I heard there was
a 2.3 magnitude earthquake in Ojai.

1174
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,299
Is that anywhere near Ohio?

1175
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:36,176
It's 2000 miles away.

1176
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:38,470
You don't need to worry
about any earthquakes.

1177
01:23:38,638 --> 01:23:40,764
- What about volcanoes?
- No.

1178
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:41,724
Giant birds?

1179
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:43,767
Goodbye, Papa. I love you.

1180
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:44,977
I love you, sweetness.

1181
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,312
Hey, can you wish Sean
a happy birthday for me?

1182
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,982
And maybe I'll call you later.
Say, in five minutes?

1183
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:52,818
- Bye, Papa.
- I love you, baby. Bye.

1184
01:23:53,236 --> 01:23:56,030
Okay, are we ready for the journey?!

1185
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:00,826
Whoo!

1186
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,995
Yeah! Yeah!

1187
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:04,872
Hello.

1188
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:05,956
Hey, guys.

1189
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:07,833
I'm sorry I'm late.

1190
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,252
- Hey, darling.
- Hey.

1191
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,171
- You look wonderful.
- Good to see you.

1192
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,506
- Come here for a second.
- Okay.

1193
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:19,845
- Happy birthday.
- You raised a great man.

1194
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:21,221
- No.
- So sorry I'm late.

1195
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,932
We are raising a great man.

1196
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:31,774
Open this one first.

1197
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:33,442
Postmarked Cameroon?

1198
01:24:39,115 --> 01:24:41,116
Oh, it's from Grandpa.

1199
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:43,619
He wants to give me...

1200
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:45,537
...his present next time he sees me.

1201
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,301
Well, don't just sit there. Applaud!

1202
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:00,552
Grandpa!

1203
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,599
- Hi.
- Hey.

1204
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,059
Can't believe you're here.

1205
01:25:07,393 --> 01:25:09,645
I wouldn't miss your birthday
for the world.

1206
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:13,649
I wanted to give you this.

1207
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:15,943
A book?

1208
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,488
Oh, it's not just a book.
It's a trip I want us to go on.

1209
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,698
All of us, as a family.

1210
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:31,208
From the Earth to the Moon.

1211
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:33,669
What do you say?

1212
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:37,256
Well, I think there's only
one thing to say.

1213
01:25:37,423 --> 01:25:39,800
- So who's up for an adventure?
- No, no, no!

1214
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:43,095
Oh, honey, what could possibly
go wrong? It's only the moon.
