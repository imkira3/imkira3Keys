00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,319
<i>...what has
turned into a classic Formula 1 season.</i>

3
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,848
<i>With the
weather conditions so uncertain,</i>

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,239
<i>the drivers prepare for...</i>

5
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,839
<i>...the track
is still dangerously wet,</i>

6
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,319
<i>but following a drivers' meeting,</i>

7
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,403
<i>- a decision has finally been taken.
- Three minutes to go.</i>

8
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,239
<i>Everybody off the grid now.</i>

9
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,319
<i>Twenty-five drivers
start every season in Formula 1,</i>

10
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,403
<i>and each year two of us die.</i>

11
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,527
<i>What kind of person
does a job like this?</i>

12
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,759
<i>Not normal men, for sure.</i>

13
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,004
<i>Rebels, lunatics, dreamers.</i>

14
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,081
<i>People who are desperate to make a mark</i>

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,441
<i>and are prepared to die trying.</i>

16
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,885
<i>My name is Niki Lauda,</i>

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,439
<i>and racing people
know me for two things.</i>

18
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,206
<i>The first is my rivalry with him.</i>

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,284
<i>Photographers,
please clear the grid.</i>

20
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,768
What about Hunt? Has he changed?

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,559
No, he's going on wets.

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,759
<i>I don't know
why it became such a big thing.</i>

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,128
<i>We were just drivers
busting each other's balls.</i>

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,639
<i>To me this is perfectly normal,</i>

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,879
<i>but other people saw it differently,</i>

26
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,804
<i>that whatever it was between us
went deeper.</i>

27
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,159
<i>The other thing I'm remembered for</i>

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,999
<i>is what happened on 1st August, 1976,</i>

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,599
<i>when I was chasing him</i>

30
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,759
<i>like an asshole.</i>

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,719
Trauma trolley, please.

32
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,199
Hello, I think the racetrack
telephoned ahead that I was coming.

33
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,645
Hunt. James Hunt.

34
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,803
What's the matter? No one ever seen
a spot of blood before?

35
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,811
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.

36
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,849
We all thought
you'd been in an accident.

37
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,007
I have.

38
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,323
If you call a friendly disagreement
with another driver an accident.

39
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,319
What did you disagree about?

40
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,890
It's none of your business.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,002
Sorry.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,365
His wife.

43
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,999
That's going to need a couple
of stitches. It's a nasty cut.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,083
It was a nasty blow.
Done with a bloody crowbar.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,765
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

46
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,601
Only what she asked me to do.

47
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,365
Which was...

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,526
I'd be happy to show you, if you like.

49
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,007
Oh! Sorry.

50
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,920
<i>I have a theory
why women like racing drivers.</i>

51
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,679
<i>It's not because
they respect what we do,</i>

52
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,559
<i>driving round and round in circles.</i>

53
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,131
<i>Mostly they think that's pathetic,
and they're probably right.</i>

54
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,442
<i>It's our closeness to death.</i>

55
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,039
<i>You see, the closer you are to death,
the more alive you feel.</i>

56
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,119
<i>The more alive you are.
And they can see that in you.</i>

57
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,043
<i>They feel that in you.</i>

58
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,441
<i>My name is James Hunt.</i>

59
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,599
<i>My father is a stockbroker,</i>

60
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,207
<i>my sister is a barrister
and my brother is an accountant.</i>

61
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,725
<i>And I...</i>

62
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,890
<i>Well, I do this.</i>

63
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,925
<i>It's a wonderful way to live.</i>

64
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,128
<i>It's the only way to drive.</i>

65
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,481
<i>As if each day is your last.</i>

66
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,319
I've never been to a Grand Prix before.

67
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,239
Oh, you still haven't.

68
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,766
- This is Formula 3.
- What's that?

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,919
It's a lower division,

70
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,446
where idiots like me mess about

71
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,599
in the hope of being talent-spotted
to race in Formula 1.

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,602
- You look disappointed.
- No.

73
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,359
Ah. You only slept with me
because you thought I was famous.

74
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,930
That's not true.

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,679
Don't worry. I will be one day.

76
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,319
Morning, everyone.

77
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,924
- This is Nursie.
- Gemma.

78
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,519
Nursie, this is Bubbles Horsley,
team manager.

79
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,601
How do you do?

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,799
- Bubbles?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,879
- Doc Postlethwaite, our designer.
- How do you do?

82
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,805
And Alexander, Lord Hesketh,
the team's owner.

83
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,330
How do you do?

84
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,679
Fine, thanks.

85
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,639
Well done, Superstar.

86
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,166
- That's the car?
- Yep, that's her.

87
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,009
Lotus 59.

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,851
1,000cc Cosworth MAE engine.

89
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,804
She's no beauty,
but goes like the clappers.

90
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:34,479
Nothing to be worried about.
Does it before every race.

91
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,639
Good sign, actually. Means he's stoked.

92
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,850
<i>All Formula 3 cars
to the assembly area now, please.</i>

93
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,769
<i>...drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now.</i>

94
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,730
All right, Superstar?

95
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,559
Never better, patron.

96
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,040
- Have a gargle with this.
- Thank you.

97
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,931
Quick toke of this.

98
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,730
<i>At Crystal Palace today,
James Hunt's on pole,</i>

99
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,879
<i>with Austrian newcomer
Niki Lauda alongside him</i>

100
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,599
<i>and Dave Walker completing Row 1.</i>

101
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,080
<i>Row 2 is Mike Beuttler and Dave Morgan,</i>

102
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,090
<i>- with Tony Trimmer and Gerry Birrell.</i>
- Who's that?

103
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,965
He's new.

104
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,359
- Some German.
- Austrian.

105
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,519
He's been here since 5:00 am,
walking the track.

106
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,959
You might actually
have to concentrate today, James.

107
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,564
You'll need these.

108
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,879
Okay, start her up.

109
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,399
Ah! What music!

110
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,959
They could never have imagined it,

111
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,247
those pioneers
who invented the automobile,

112
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,570
that it would possess us like this,
in our imaginations, in our dreams.

113
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,607
Nursie, men love women,

114
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,559
but even more than that,

115
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,882
men love cars.

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,163
- Come on, James!
- James! Come on, James!

117
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,571
Go, James!

118
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,479
<i>Hunt's still in the lead,</i>

119
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,642
<i>but Niki Lauda is right on his tail.</i>

120
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:31,319
<i>Hunt and Lauda are
proving to be in a class of their own.</i>

121
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,924
<i>They're leaving the pack far behind.</i>

122
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,924
<i>Herr</i> Red Devil's on his tail.

123
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:43,119
<i>Lauda takes
a look down the inside...</i>

124
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,444
<i>...and he's sold him a dummy!</i>

125
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,962
<i>Lauda is through! He's in the lead!</i>

126
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,201
<i>Hunt will be determined
to make up for that mistake.</i>

127
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,530
<i>Hunt's in Lauda's slipstream.</i>

128
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,608
<i>Lauda's not leaving any gap.</i>

129
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,725
<i>The Lotus goes for the inside.
It's an aggressive move from Hunt.</i>

130
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,799
<i>Oh! There's contact!</i>

131
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,723
<i>The leaders have spun out!
Lauda's facing the wrong way!</i>

132
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,687
<i>The back marker's gone through.</i>

133
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:35,719
<i>You can see why Hunt's fellow drivers</i>

134
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,529
<i>call him "Hunt the Shunt".</i>

135
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,079
Asshole!

136
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,844
- Go on, James!
- The Kraut's out of it.

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,159
<i>Lauda is clearly furious.</i>

138
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,679
<i>There's every reason
to expect sharp words in the pits.</i>

139
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,569
<i>It's gonna be victory for Hunt.</i>

140
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,039
<i>It's gonna be an ignominious defeat
for Niki Lauda.</i>

141
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,679
<i>So James Hunt scores his
third major Formula 3 win of the season</i>

142
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,920
<i>here at Crystal Palace,</i>

143
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,839
<i>after a desperate battle
with Niki Lauda.</i>

144
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,569
<i>Lauda was unable to restart</i>

145
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,411
<i>after Hunt's aggressive move
caused them both to spin out</i>

146
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,681
<i>in the last lap of the race.</i>

147
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,800
Hard luck.
Better luck next time.

148
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,885
Hey, asshole.

149
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,199
That was my line. I had that corner.

150
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,443
Do you mean the one that you spun out of
and finished facing the other way?

151
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,959
I think that corner had you.

152
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,559
That move was total suicide.
What if I hadn't braked?

153
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,439
- We'd have crashed.
- But we didn't, did we?

154
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,408
Thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts.

155
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,403
Fuck you. What's your name?

156
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,454
James Simon Wallis Hunt.
Remember it, my little Jerry friend.

157
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:47,439
<i>Jawohl.</i> Remember ze name.

158
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,279
And it's very simple. Hunt.
It rhymes with...

159
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,479
...cunt.

160
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,960
A word that happens
to describe you perfectly!

161
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,079
Who was that?

162
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,319
I've no idea.
He looks like a rat, doesn't he?

163
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,005
<i>In my home town, Vienna,</i>

164
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,762
<i>my family is famous
for one thing - business.</i>

165
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,607
<i>My grandfather was a businessman,</i>

166
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,525
<i>my father, too.</i>

167
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,519
<i>So when they heard I wanted
to race cars for a living,</i>

168
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,329
<i>they had a few things to say.</i>

169
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,805
<i>Gut.</i>

170
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,482
<i>So if my family
wasn't going to help me,</i>

171
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,399
<i>I decided to risk everything
and take out a loan myself.</i>

172
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,370
<i>I found a Formula 1 team
with an okay car</i>

173
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,528
<i>and an owner who had run out of money</i>

174
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,802
<i>and was willing to accept my terms.</i>

175
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,884
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,839
I'm delighted to say

177
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,367
that the winner of the Guild of Motoring
Writers Award Driver of the Year...

178
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,561
is James Hunt.

179
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,925
Superb news!

180
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,842
- Well done, James.
- Superstar!

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,445
Fantastic!

182
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:40,359
Well done. Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

183
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,519
Yes!

184
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,879
Erm...

185
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,690
You know, my parents
always wanted me to be a doctor...

186
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,999
...or a stockbroker or something.

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,759
They gave me the first-class education,

188
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,919
but, well, that all went terribly wrong

189
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,800
and I ended up with you lot.

190
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,359
Thank you. I need it more than you do.

191
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,086
I mean, I have a hot head,
an inability to tolerate discipline.

192
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,565
- Yes!
- Very true.

193
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,123
I fall out with people left and right.

194
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,879
The only creatures I've ever really
loved or have treated honourably

195
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,882
are budgerigars.

196
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,205
So in any normal area of life I'd be...
or I am, a total liability.

197
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,880
The only thing I've got going for me
is I'm quick in a car.

198
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,039
So, thank you for this
and for acknowledging that.

199
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,559
I'm going to give it to my father

200
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,399
and tell him to put it
on the mantelpiece

201
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,799
and imagine it's a first-class degree
in medicine.

202
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,959
Well done, Superstar.

203
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,566
Another season like that
and I'll move you up to the big time.

204
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,319
Come on, you don't think I'm ready now?

205
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,688
You are. I'm not.
I've got to find you a car first.

206
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,239
Well, go on, then. Chop-chop.

207
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,599
Don't wait too long. You don't want him
to do what Lauda just did.

208
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,639
- Why? What did he do?
- Got himself a drive with BRM.

209
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,919
Well, how the hell did he do that?
He's a nobody.

210
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,439
He's never won a bloody thing.

211
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,439
Apparently, took out a loan
and bought his way in

212
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,159
with two million Austrian schillings.

213
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,605
Jesus.

214
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,169
Niki Lauda.
Here for pre-season testing. BRM?

215
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,490
Sign the release form.
I'll let them know you're here.

216
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,799
- Mr Stanley.
- Good morning.

217
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,799
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Clay!

218
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,559
Let me introduce you
to our number-one driver,

219
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,562
Clay Regazzoni.

220
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,689
- How are you?
- Good.

221
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,444
- Pleasure.
- And these are your mechanics.

222
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,519
They're reporting exclusively to you,
as per contract.

223
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,359
Pleasure. Do you wanna see the car?

224
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,805
Sure.

225
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,251
Hello.

226
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,726
There she is. P160.

227
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,126
- Same as Regazzoni's?
- Identical in every detail.

228
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,570
How much does she weigh?

229
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,326
- 600 kilos.
- But that's crazy.

230
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,199
- Why so heavy?
- It's a V12 engine.

231
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,399
That lump weighs 190K on its own.

232
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,399
Okay.

233
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,759
What horsepower are you getting? 490?

234
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,239
- No, no, 450.
- Well, it's not enough.

235
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,719
It needs to be 500,

236
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,479
and the engine
needs to be 20 kilo lighter.

237
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,799
We already tried.

238
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,961
- Tried what?
- Everything.

239
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,719
We replaced the entire exhaust system.

240
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,008
- Barely made a difference.
- Are you using magnesium parts?

241
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,559
Now the engine block.

242
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,291
Any mounting or fixing plates,
strip it out also.

243
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,759
When you've done that,
we have to look at the aerodynamics,

244
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,524
front and rear wing.

245
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,042
Okay, thank you. Good night.

246
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,445
What was Regazzoni's time?

247
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,731
1:53.

248
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,999
Okay, now put him in my car,
and he'll go round two seconds faster.

249
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,049
- Well, that's impossible.
- No chance.

250
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,439
We've been
working on it all night.

251
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,559
Put Regazzoni in the car.
See what happens.

252
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,479
I don't understand.
Why am I supposed to do this?

253
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,840
I don't know, Clay.
He just wants you to take it for a spin.

254
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,279
Gloves, please.

255
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,725
<i>'fanculo.</i>

256
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,039
- I would say we push it a bit...
- All right.

257
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,119
What did you do to the car?

258
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,647
That's information I will share with you
under certain conditions only.

259
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,325
Go on.

260
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,084
A guaranteed place in the team,

261
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,960
and a paid contract on equal terms
with Regazzoni for two years.

262
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,804
Are you crazy?

263
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,447
Clay's a senior figure in Formula 1.
You're just a rookie.

264
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,360
Well, the only reason we took you on
is because you're paying us.

265
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,959
Well, as of now, if you want me to stay,
we rip up the contract.

266
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,691
- I don't pay you a cent.
- That's outrageous!

267
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,282
Was he quicker in my car?

268
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,002
He was, wasn't he?

269
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,961
Did he go two seconds faster?

270
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,045
2.3.

271
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,888
So, have a think,

272
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,761
work out your priorities
and get back to me.

273
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,171
Hey, Niki.

274
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,450
I know what you're going to say,
that it's none of my business.

275
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,561
What?

276
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,282
If it's the track manager
you're taking on your date tonight...

277
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,959
It's none of your business.

278
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,726
Okay, but if you want my advice,
I'd let this one go.

279
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,721
I'm not questioning your taste.
She is a great girl, but...

280
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,319
Agnes's last boyfriend
was a British Formula 2 driver

281
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,719
who has a reputation for two things.

282
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,405
For being a little crazy on the track,

283
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,724
and for going all night and all day
and all night again in bed.

284
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,359
He's a good driver,
but an immortal fuck, apparently.

285
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,399
I don't know about you, but
that's not an act I'd like to follow.

286
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,722
But if that doesn't bother you...

287
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,610
What's his name, the driver?

288
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,365
Hunt. James Hunt.

289
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,927
You see, you share information
and I share information.

290
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,487
That's what teammates are for.

291
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,279
<i>Where the hell are we going?</i>

292
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,639
<i>I promise it'll be worth it.</i>

293
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,085
<i>Just keep them closed.</i>

294
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,965
Wait for it.

295
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,609
Wait for it.

296
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,406
There. What do you say?

297
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,090
She's Formula 1.

298
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,204
Yes, she is, Superstar.

299
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,519
Your brother and I got together
with the bean counters.

300
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,999
And since the economics of F1

301
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,639
are not so significantly different
to the economics of Formula 2,

302
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,041
well, we thought if we were
going to be losing money,

303
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,279
we might as well be doing it on
the big roulette table in Formula 1.

304
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,602
You fat, little, inbred beauty.
Come here.

305
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,242
Actually, credit where it's due,
we got the idea from Niki.

306
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,519
- Who?
- Lauda.

307
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,359
Bought his way in, rather than
mess about in the lower divisions.

308
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,930
I thought, "Bloody hell, he's right."

309
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,639
No sponsorship, Superstar.
I hope you approve.

310
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,645
No vulgar logos
for cigarettes or condoms.

311
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,248
Just plain white with the flags. Ooh!

312
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,650
And racing overalls which read,

313
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,439
"Sex. Breakfast of champions."

314
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,929
So, when do we start?

315
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,087
- Soon as you're ready.
- Ready?

316
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,971
I've been waiting for this
my whole life.

317
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,999
- Hi, welcome to Watkins Glen.
- Hello!

318
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,764
<i>When the season started,
people wondered</i>

319
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,890
<i>whether Lord Hesketh and his team
of upper-class enthusiasts</i>

320
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,719
<i>were bringing glamour
to the racing community, or just comedy.</i>

321
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,879
Certainly, it was the first time
anyone had seen

322
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,519
a butler serving oysters and caviar
in the pits.

323
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,359
But they have made quite an impact.

324
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,599
Sixth in France, fourth in Britain
and third in Holland.

325
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,279
<i>All drivers on the track,
caution flags are out.</i>

326
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,454
<i>A severe crash at the Esses.</i>

327
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,559
<i>Red flag.
There is a car off the track.</i>

328
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,319
And reports are reaching me

329
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,527
that there has been
a serious accident in qualifying.

330
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:45,479
Er, the identity of the driver we don't
currently have at the moment,

331
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,687
but, as you can tell
from all the activity

332
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,479
going on behind me towards the track,

333
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,959
it is clearly a grave incident indeed.

334
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,439
We will, of course,
have more information for you

335
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,487
as and when we get it,

336
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,605
but it is the sight and sound
of Formula 1 nobody likes to see.

337
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,364
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey, come on.

338
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:15,959
<i>Drivers of top stature</i>

339
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,759
<i>we've lost just in the past four seasons</i>

340
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,679
<i>have included Piers Courage,
Jochen Rindt,</i>

341
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,039
<i>Jo Siffert, Roger Williamson</i>

342
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,319
<i>and today, at Watkins Glen,</i>

343
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,641
<i>Formula 1 has claimed another driver.</i>

344
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,527
<i>The Tyrrell team
have withdrawn from the race.</i>

345
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,359
<i>Their places on the grid
will be left empty.</i>

346
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,806
- Terrible.
- They should cancel the race.

347
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,565
Why?

348
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,326
He made a mistake,
went into the corner too fast.

349
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,919
It's his fault.

350
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,809
- Is that right?
- It's obvious.

351
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,929
Look at the tyre marks.

352
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,639
So says the nobody
who had to pay for his own drive.

353
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,320
How's that working out for you,
by the way?

354
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,330
Fine. How is it at the back?

355
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,322
Not planning on being there for long.

356
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:02,799
<i>Ten minutes to the warm-up lap.</i>

357
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,319
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

358
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,005
Arsehole.

359
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,759
<i>Heading into
the Grand Hotel hairpin, second gear.</i>

360
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,839
Turn in hard,

361
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,491
looking for late apex,
gentle with the bar.

362
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,369
Heading into Portier, second gear,
clip the apex,

363
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,041
light brake, stay in second,
looking for a good exit.

364
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,519
Heading through the tunnel,
gradual right,

365
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,559
up through third, fourth, fifth...

366
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,562
Is Alexander round?

367
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,759
Er, yes, he was.

368
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,439
He went back to the house
to take a call.

369
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,279
He'll be back shortly.

370
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,442
He only wanted to show me
his pride and joy.

371
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,199
Rhymes with "boy", if you ask me.

372
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,079
And "toy".

373
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,359
God, it's so flimsy
for something that costs so much.

374
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,439
There's no comfort,
no protection, nothing.

375
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,159
No, it's just a little coffin, really.

376
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,279
Surrounded by high-octane fuel in here.

377
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,279
Being driven round 170 miles per hour.

378
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,443
To all intents and purposes,
this thing's a bomb on wheels.

379
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,523
You're James, aren't you?

380
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,250
Yes.

381
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,929
You fit the description.

382
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,731
Is that right?

383
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,928
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

384
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,169
Yeah, yeah. I know exactly.

385
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,399
What was the description?

386
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,999
Mostly positive,
in terms of appearance.

387
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,207
Negative only in terms of character.

388
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,643
I've been told to avoid you.

389
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,451
By whom?

390
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,799
Alexander. He says you're a bad boy.

391
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,159
Alexander doesn't know
what he's talking about.

392
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,599
I was. I'm not any more.

393
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,199
The new me is very professional.
Early to bed, early to rise.

394
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,839
- All very dull.
- Hmm.

395
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,279
But according to the team,

396
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,961
"The best way to
keep beating the goose-stepper."

397
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,359
Is that what you were doing
when I came in?

398
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,399
Yes, visualisation techniques,
memorising the circuit,

399
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,085
in this case Monaco, which is up next.

400
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,119
Personally, I've always been a great
believer in getting there on the day,

401
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,679
putting my foot down
and playing chicken with everyone else.

402
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:16,439
But they don't want me
doing that any more.

403
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,525
They want my body like a temple
and my mind like a monk.

404
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,399
And what about your soul, your heart?

405
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,639
Well, they've got ideas about that, too.

406
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,239
They want me to stop messing around,
settle down,

407
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,559
get married
with the next nice girl I meet.

408
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,971
They think it would be good for me.

409
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,442
Hmm. What do you think?

410
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,122
It sounds fucking awful.

411
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,607
But since they're right
about most things,

412
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,599
- they're probably right about that, too.
- Hmm.

413
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,001
You don't fancy getting married, do you?

414
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,925
Suzy.

415
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,051
Bravo!

416
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,323
Hey, hey, hey!

417
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,803
- What's going on with him?
- Nothing. Nothing.

418
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,571
Didn't want to ruin your day.

419
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,561
It's... It's the Kraut.

420
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,410
What about him?

421
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,199
He's just been signed by Ferrari.

422
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,921
You're kidding me?
Jesus. How did that happen?

423
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,690
Did he buy his way in there, too?

424
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,439
Well, the old man took Regazzoni back
and he insisted on it, apparently.

425
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,408
He says that Niki's a genius
setting up the cars.

426
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,484
It's terrible. Drives like a pig.

427
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,687
- Oh, you can't say that.
- Why not?

428
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,088
- It's a Ferrari!
- It's a shitbox.

429
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,999
It understeers like crazy and
the weight distribution is a disaster.

430
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,049
It's amazing, all these facilities
and you make a piece of crap like this.

431
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,879
Uh!

432
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,759
"Ferrari family."
"Our good friend Clay Regazzoni."

433
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,319
You are family and friend
to the commendatore as long as you win.

434
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,731
The minute you don't, ciao, ciao.

435
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,170
I totally understand. It's business.
I would do the same.

436
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,279
But it isn't
just business, is it? What we do.

437
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,439
It's passion, love.

438
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,279
Which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it.

439
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,399
Not me.

440
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,121
If I had more talent and could earn
better money with something else,

441
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,959
I would.

442
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,639
How do you know you will
make money here? You haven't yet.

443
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,961
Not yet, but I will.

444
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,529
If you can, I can.

445
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,243
You know, are you ever not an asshole?

446
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,639
- Why am I an asshole?
- Well...

447
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,239
You know, by now
I'm both quicker than you

448
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,159
and better at setting up the car.

449
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,999
You can't deal with it,
so you're the asshole.

450
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,161
Screw you.

451
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,359
I brought you along today because
you seem like a lonely kind of guy.

452
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,319
I thought if I introduced you
to some nice people,

453
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,199
that could rub off on you.

454
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,919
Forget it. Make your own friends.

455
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,605
Come on, Clay. I'm sorry.

456
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,565
Are you leaving?

457
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,091
Yes.

458
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,319
Can you give me a lift
to the nearest town,

459
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,765
anywhere with a train station?

460
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,643
Sure. Trento's half an hour's drive.

461
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,327
Get in.

462
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,127
♬ Been another blue day
without you, girl

463
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,767
♬ Been another sad summer song

464
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,525
♬ I been thinking about you, girl,
all night long

465
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,561
What are you doing?

466
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,561
You hear that noise when you accelerate?

467
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,247
- No.
- Your fan belt is loose.

468
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,119
My What?

469
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,599
And when you brake,
your foot goes all the way down,

470
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,120
which means there's air in the system.

471
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,931
- Anything else?
- No.

472
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,685
Apart from
the rear brakes are worn out,

473
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,479
the front right tyre's a bit soft,

474
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,279
which explains
why you're weaving so much.

475
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,760
Hmm. How can you tell?

476
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,088
- My ass.
- Sorry?

477
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,199
God gave me an okay mind,

478
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,931
but a really good ass,
which can feel everything in a car.

479
00:31:52,215 --> 00:31:54,559
You don't know what
you're talking about. This car is fine.

480
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,359
- I just had a service a week ago.
- Not a good one.

481
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,011
Yes, a very good one, very expensive.

482
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,719
This car is as good as new. Relax.

483
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,559
Not in a hurry, are you?

484
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,319
No. As long as I'm back

485
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,651
in Maranello Monday morning.

486
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,399
<i>Ja.</i>

487
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,562
- Marlene.
- Niki.

488
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,851
<i>Mi scusi... Tu sei Niki Lauda?</i>

489
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,999
Yes.

490
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,319
- Actually, we do, yeah.
- Okay.

491
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,599
It's my honour, Niki, please.

492
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,841
- Thank you.
- My car is your car.

493
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,759
On one condition, though.
It's a piece of shit. It's dog shit.

494
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,843
But if you drive it,
you make my life, Niki, eh?

495
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,808
- Niki Lauda!
- Niki Lauda, Niki Lauda!

496
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,119
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

497
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,639
Who are you? Should I know you?

498
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,130
What, you don't know?

499
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,719
He's Niki Lauda, Formula 1 driver,
and he just signed with Ferrari.

500
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,210
- Him?
- Yes.

501
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,527
- Impossible.
- Why?

502
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,199
Well, you know, Formula 1 drivers,
they have long hair, are sexy,

503
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,719
their shirts are open to here.

504
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,479
- Thank you.
- Yes.

505
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,882
Anyway, look at the way he's driving,
like an old man.

506
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,640
There's no need to drive fast.

507
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,922
It just increases
the percentage of risk.

508
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,481
We're not in a hurry.
I'm not being paid.

509
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,919
Right now,
with zero incentive or reward,

510
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,684
why would I drive fast?

511
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,522
Because I'm asking you to.

512
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,371
<i>Ja.</i>

513
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,079
<i>This is an incredible battle</i>

514
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,559
<i>between Niki Lauda in the red Ferrari</i>

515
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,086
<i>and James Hunt in the white Hesketh.</i>

516
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,759
...the challenge of Niki Lauda...

517
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,279
<i>Lauda attacking Hunt.</i>

518
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,089
<i>Lauda gets through on the inside.</i>

519
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,725
<i>Goes wide at the exit.</i>

520
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,439
<i>Hunt is past again.</i>

521
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,599
<i>Once more
Lauda tries to sneak up the inside.</i>

522
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,679
<i>They're absolutely side by side,
wheel to wheel.</i>

523
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,759
<i>So evenly matched. Fantastic battle
between these two great drivers.</i>

524
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,127
<i>Hunt is now ahead once more.</i>

525
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,279
<i>But Lauda's coming back again now.
Lauda once more sneaks up the inside.</i>

526
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,760
<i>And again he runs wide.
Again the Hesketh...</i>

527
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,083
- Suzy, we're ready, come on.
- Just... Just one second.

528
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,611
- Can we go, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

529
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,199
<i>We're in the closing laps
of this race here at Watkins Glen.</i>

530
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,201
<i>They come down the hill.</i>

531
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,639
<i>And Hunt's got a problem!</i>

532
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,119
<i>Hunt pulls across to the left.</i>

533
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,964
<i>Lauda goes ahead on his own.</i>

534
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,120
<i>A sad end to a wonderful battle.</i>

535
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,811
<i>Hunt pushing off the marshal.</i>

536
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,325
<i>The chequered flag
is waiting for Lauda and for Ferrari.</i>

537
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,479
<i>The title going to Niki Lauda,</i>

538
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,999
<i>who wins the race,</i>

539
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,480
<i>who wins the World Championship.</i>

540
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,290
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

541
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,559
Marlene.

542
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,919
With a car like that, the rest of us
never really stood a chance, did we?

543
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,890
Maybe the fact the car is so good
has something to do with me.

544
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,890
Come on, Niki. You're in a Ferrari.
I'm in a Hesketh.

545
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,959
Equal terms,
the way it was in Formula 3,

546
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,406
- I'd beat you and you know it.
- Never.

547
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,410
You might win one race, maybe two,
because you're aggressive.

548
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,723
But in the long run, over the course
of a season, no chance.

549
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,887
Right. Why's that?

550
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,891
Because to be a champion,
it takes more than just being quick.

551
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,799
- It's the whole picture.
- Oh.

552
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,839
You're just a charger and a party guy.

553
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,080
That's why everybody likes you.

554
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,759
Try saying that
and tell me you're not jealous.

555
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,725
Why would I be jealous? Think about it.

556
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,239
All that affection, all those smiles

557
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,079
- is a sign of disrespect.
- Oh.

558
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,599
They don't fear you.
Whereas compare that to me.

559
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,251
Yes, compared to you, whom no one likes.

560
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,999
- Right.
- Not even his own teammates.

561
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,765
Right. Because I'm a serious guy.

562
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,281
I go to bed early,
I look after myself, look after my car.

563
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,449
- Yes, you're very well-behaved.
- Go to work, kick ass.

564
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,291
And then, after the race,
I go home instead of going to bars

565
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,599
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes.

566
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,519
Arseholes?

567
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,966
You should go home more often, too.

568
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,282
I heard you got married.

569
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,884
Yes, I did.

570
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,046
So where is she, this mysterious wife?

571
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,242
- In New York, working.
- Oh.

572
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,639
You know,
I've never seen you with her once.

573
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,880
No?

574
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,199
Well, maybe that's because
you're always at home,

575
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,125
on your own, looking after yourself,
being a good little boy.

576
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,651
Take a drink on me, James.

577
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,166
Thank you, Niki. I might just have two.

578
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,039
Right, Bubbles,

579
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,169
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year, just say it.

580
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,691
Your word is my command.

581
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,282
There are no lengths
to which I will not go. I mean it.

582
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,683
What the hell's going on?

583
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,446
Where is everybody? What's the matter?

584
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,599
Do you know what the date is today?

585
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,046
Yes, it's November, the 14th. Why?

586
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,724
Do you have any idea
of the significance of that date?

587
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,203
I don't know.
Time to start killing pheasants?

588
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,359
Actually, it's the deadline
for securing sponsorship

589
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,283
for the forthcoming Formula 1 season.

590
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,965
Yes?

591
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,130
Which elapsed at midnight last night,
and we didn't attract any.

592
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,159
Well, so?
We aren't looking for sponsorship.

593
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,447
Like you said, condoms and cigarettes,
vulgar, right?

594
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,606
Right.

595
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,527
Except we are, or were.

596
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,766
I've made something of a miscalculation.

597
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,202
The economics, Formula 1,
realities thereof.

598
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,763
It turns out,
not like the lower divisions at all.

599
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,009
What are you saying?

600
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,400
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.

601
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,767
The banks have stepped in,
started laying everyone off.

602
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,961
Probably have to sell this place.

603
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,562
Oh, Christ.

604
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,966
I need a drive, Pete.
I need you to find me a drive.

605
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,925
I mean, what about Lotus?

606
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,485
You don't wanna know.

607
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,451
- Actually, I do.
<i>- Okay. Uh...</i>

608
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,802
They felt your reputation preceded you.

609
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,879
And what does that mean?

610
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,489
It's my other line.
Look, I'll get back to you.

611
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,481
Peter Hunt.

612
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,410
Fuck.

613
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,685
Don't worry. Something will turn up.

614
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,528
Doubt that will help in the meantime.

615
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,199
Why don't we go away at the weekend?

616
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,329
Skiing. Before I go back to New York.

617
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,362
Talk to me, James.
Don't make a stranger of me.

618
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,519
You know, Suzy,
only a stranger would invite me skiing

619
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,966
when they know
I haven't got a fucking drive.

620
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,124
I can't watch this.

621
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,201
What were you hoping for anyway?

622
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,039
A well-adjusted knight
in shining armour?

623
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,039
No danger of that.

624
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,399
- Let me give you some advice.
- I'm all ears.

625
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,239
Don't go to men who are willing
to kill themselves driving in circles

626
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,891
- looking for normality.
- I never expected normality.

627
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,159
God knows I walked into this
with my eyes open.

628
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,719
I just hoped I'd married someone

629
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,803
who was half as impressive
on the inside as he is on the outside.

630
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,719
At least there's something
behind the facade.

631
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,927
- Oh, James.
- Fuck off to New York, dear.

632
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,479
There must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere

633
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,244
that needs your vapid mush to flog it.

634
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,439
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, James.</i>

635
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,762
It's Peter. Something's up at McLaren.

636
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,439
<i>- What have you heard?</i>
- Nothing. Why?

637
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,966
I heard Emerson's off.
He's dumped them in it.

638
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,799
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.

639
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,201
Say anything, just get me in that room.

640
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,959
I'll come straight to the point.

641
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,479
- Our esteemed lead driver...
- Fitti-fucking-paldi.

642
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,799
...has ditched us for another team
at the last minute.

643
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,159
- Coper-fucking-sucar.
- And we need a replacement.

644
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,650
ASA-fucking-P.

645
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,486
Fortunately, a few hands
have already gone up, good people.

646
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,005
- Jacky Ickx.
- I'm quicker than Jacky.

647
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,399
- But he's consistent, dependable.
- A grown-up.

648
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,847
Right, and will he go for that gap
when no one else will?

649
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,928
Will he put his life on the line
the day that it really matters?

650
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,685
The sponsors like him.

651
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,399
What do you want,
a driver or a brush salesman?

652
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,320
- We wanna be successful.
- Yes, so do I.

653
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,599
But that means beating Niki Lauda,
not being a show pony for sponsors.

654
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,159
I heard about this thing with Niki.

655
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,366
Everyone has.

656
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:06,079
- You really think you can beat him?
- I'd beat him in a McLaren.

657
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,368
It's the only car out there
as quick as the Ferrari.

658
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,682
Which is why I'm here, begging.

659
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,679
Look, I'll do whatever you ask.

660
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,523
I'll put on a tie,
I'll smile for sponsors,

661
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,529
say the right things.

662
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,161
I can beat this guy, trust me.

663
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,889
Just give me the drive.

664
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,489
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, he can be a loose cannon.</i>

665
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,359
And, yeah, he will drive you all mad,

666
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,887
but in terms of raw talent
and right stuff,

667
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,889
there is no better driver in the world.

668
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,442
<i>He's the real thing, Teddy.</i>

669
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,094
<i>- He's what we all came into this for.</i>
- Mmm.

670
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,199
Nine days out of ten
you'll be pulling your hair out,

671
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,399
but on that tenth day,
James will be unbeatable.

672
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,402
And that is the day you will wish
you had him in your car.

673
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,524
<i>You will never win the championship
with Jacky Ickx.</i>

674
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,319
You just might with James.

675
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:15,879
Welcome to São Paulo, Brazil,
and the Interlagos circuit

676
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,521
for the first race
in the 1976 Formula 1 season,

677
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,999
where the main news is that James Hunt
has qualified fastest,

678
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,082
beating Niki Lauda's Ferrari
to pole position

679
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,931
by just two hundredths of a second.

680
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,524
New car.

681
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,010
- I noticed.
- Pole position.

682
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,439
I noticed that, too.

683
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,919
Level playing field now,
my ratty little friend.

684
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,599
Yeah. Let's see where we are
after lap one.

685
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,410
Let's see where we are
in five races' time.

686
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,439
Hunt has the pit lane pole position,

687
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,250
which should give him the best chance
of out dragging Lauda's Ferrari.

688
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,959
If ever there was a doubt about

689
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,279
whether Lauda had
a serious challenger to this season,

690
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,921
Hunt and his McLaren
have certainly given us the answer.

691
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,159
<i>Here in South Africa,</i>

692
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,162
<i>James Hunt is determined to make amends</i>

693
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,284
<i>after that disastrous retirement
in Brazil.</i>

694
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,839
<i>But it's Lauda who takes the flag
here at Kyalami.</i>

695
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,559
<i>James Hunt comes home second</i>

696
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,079
<i>to confirm his championship
challenge at last</i>

697
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,839
<i>and score his first points</i>

698
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,410
<i>of the season.</i>

699
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,846
That wind you can feel
is me breathing down your neck.

700
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,962
Next time I'll have you.

701
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,331
We'll see in Spain.

702
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,679
<i>James Hunt finally takes
his first victory of the season</i>

703
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,206
<i>here in Spain, after a brilliant drive.</i>

704
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,527
It was only a matter of time.

705
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,690
Luca, don't you think it's time
to tell them?

706
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,721
- It's too wide.
- Disqualified.

707
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,559
- What?
- You're disqualified.

708
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,244
How can we be disqualified?

709
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,239
- 1.5 centimetres.
- It's the same car.

710
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,402
<i>Giustissimo.</i>

711
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,721
You fucking...

712
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,719
<i>...McLaren M23
has proved very controversial here.</i>

713
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,563
Just make it narrower. I don't care how.

714
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,759
New rear suspension.
New wishbones.

715
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,570
I wanna make sure
this thing is legal, no doubts.

716
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,159
Well, then we'd better move the
oil coolers back to the old position.

717
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,399
With the oil coolers back, the
wing brackets need to be changed, too.

718
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,599
Fuck.

719
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,759
What the fuck
d'you think we're doing?

720
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,919
<i>And with Hunt disqualified
from his Spain win,</i>

721
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,599
<i>his championship year is not going well.</i>

722
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,126
<i>And now it's all gone wrong
here at Monaco!</i>

723
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,439
<i>His engine is smoking.</i>

724
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,131
Smoke pouring
from the engine of that McLaren!

725
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,759
And James Hunt is out!

726
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,279
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Sure. It's magic.

727
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,519
We've taken a great car,
a great piece of engineering,

728
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,729
and overnight turned it into
a big, huge, stinking turd.

729
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,051
Shit!

730
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,799
What the hell have you done?
The car's evil.

731
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,559
It's fucking undriveable!

732
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,479
James, look, if there's a problem
with the car we'll find it...

733
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,559
The car is a piece of shit.
You should be appealing this.

734
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,608
- We are appealing it.
- We will sort it out.

735
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,799
- They're killing us out there.
- Go and get your dick wet.

736
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,639
- You're a wanker.
- Fuck you.

737
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,479
- You're a fucking wanker.
- I will, arsehole.

738
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,399
But this was a good race for you,
no, Niki?

739
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,481
It's good for everyone

740
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,489
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car.

741
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,331
James, you're 50 points
behind Lauda in the championship.

742
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,887
You've had another retirement today.
What's going wrong?

743
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,999
Oh, it's dirty politics
and dirty tricks,

744
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,411
that's what's going wrong.

745
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,079
<i>So, as we approach
the halfway point</i>

746
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,844
<i>in this year's Formula 1 season,</i>

747
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,679
<i>Ferrari and Niki Lauda
seem clearly on top,</i>

748
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,729
<i>and James Hunt and McLaren
are struggling.</i>

749
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,287
So, five races in,
how's it going so far?

750
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,923
It's fine. Just got a little problem
with an Austrian rat

751
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,679
and his team of Italian cheats

752
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,199
- who have destroyed my car.
- What are you talking about?

753
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,362
I'm talking about the race in Spain
that I won.

754
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,689
- Yeah, in a car which is not legal.
- Five-eighths of an inch too wide.

755
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,041
You know that doesn't have
the slightest effect on speed.

756
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,527
But you complained and your team
of lawyers leaned on the authorities.

757
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,879
Now we've had to rebuild the car,
and it's become a monster.

758
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,850
- At least it's a legal monster.
- You've had to resort to cheating.

759
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,721
You're driving an illegal car
and call me the cheat? It's pathetic.

760
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,119
- Rules are rules.
- Yes, and rats are rats.

761
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,201
Thank you. Thank you.

762
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,239
Do you really think it upsets me, James,

763
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,239
calling me a rat
because I look like one?

764
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,969
I don't mind it.

765
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,959
Rats are ugly, sure,
and nobody likes them,

766
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,719
but they're very intelligent and
they have a strong survival instinct.

767
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,404
- Wonderful.
- Marlene, <i>komm.</i>

768
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,525
No wonder she left him.

769
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,890
Anyone seen Suzy?

770
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,079
She's supposed to be here today.

771
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,243
We, er... didn't wanna tell you
before the race.

772
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,770
Tell me what?

773
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,565
Jesus.

774
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,805
Is that from him?

775
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,811
Yeah.

776
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,482
So when did all this start?

777
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,007
That weekend I went skiing.

778
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,087
Why have you come here, James?

779
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,085
I've come to get you back.

780
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,169
You don't want me back.

781
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,999
You never wanted to be married
in the first place.

782
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,321
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, come on, James.

783
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,479
You did it because
you hoped it might change you,

784
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,164
settle you down, help with the racing.

785
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,931
No, I didn't.

786
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,319
And who knows?
If it had been just the drinking

787
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,159
or the dope or the infidelity
or the moods,

788
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,321
it might even have worked.

789
00:54:22,655 --> 00:54:24,999
- But when it's all of them...
- Yes, I know, I'm terrible.

790
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,843
No, you're not terrible.

791
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,003
You're just who you are
at this point in your life.

792
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,004
God help anyone who wants more.

793
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,883
And Richard Burton,
will he able to give you more?

794
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,806
You know, he has quite
the bad boy reputation himself.

795
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,531
What's important is how it feels to me,

796
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,967
and it feels like he adores me.

797
00:54:57,055 --> 00:54:58,959
- James!
- New York Times!

798
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,479
Are you and Suzy getting back together?

799
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,479
- James, how do you feel...
- It's all very amicable.

800
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,039
My wife has found herself
a new backer...

801
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,639
I mean, lover, which makes her happy.

802
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,239
And Mr Burton has found
a way of feeling young again,

803
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,719
which makes him happy.

804
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,079
Let's hope his pockets are deep.
They'll need to be.

805
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,399
And I've found a way to be single
and have an ex-wife

806
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,159
without it costing me a penny,

807
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,399
which has got to go down
as the biggest win of my career.

808
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,131
I have a flight to catch.

809
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,519
<i>We haven't seen
this sort of intensity</i>

810
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,199
<i>from James Hunt all season long.</i>

811
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,199
Reports have been coming out
of the McLaren camp all week

812
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,682
that their car is now fully legal
and faster than ever.

813
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,568
Never mind the bloody wets.
We're still quick.

814
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,082
Hunt has really closed the gap on Lauda
as they head into Druids.

815
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,079
<i>Niki Lauda is under real pressure
from James Hunt</i>

816
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,731
<i>as they go up the hill
into Druids Corner.</i>

817
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,403
And Hunt is in front of Lauda!

818
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,285
<i>So James Hunt gets the plaudits</i>

819
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,279
<i>of the crowd, the first Briton to win</i>

820
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,930
<i>a British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch</i>

821
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,929
<i>since Jim Clark in 1964.</i>

822
00:57:56,455 --> 00:57:58,599
James, at the moment
you've got a terrific edge

823
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,570
over the rest of the field.
How have you achieved this advantage?

824
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,639
Big balls.

825
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,130
Would you...

826
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,319
<i>Following an inquiry
into the disqualification</i>

827
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,721
<i>of driver James Hunt
from the Spanish Grand Prix,</i>

828
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,319
<i>it has been decided</i>

829
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,319
<i>- to overturn this disqualification...</i>
- Yes!

830
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,799
<i>...and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points.</i>

831
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,479
James! James!

832
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,289
James, a few weeks ago
you were out of the running

833
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,319
for the season completely,
and now you're right back in it.

834
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,319
- What's changed?
- Well, it's a combination of factors

835
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,479
not all of which I'm prepared
to discuss here

836
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,804
but justice being done
re the disqualification in Spain helps,

837
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,366
and having my car
back at its best again.

838
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,970
James! James!

839
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,687
Welcome to the legendary Nürburgring.

840
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,283
This is a 14.2-mile track,

841
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,128
complete with 185 corners and bends.

842
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,999
<i>Welcome to the Nürburgring,</i>

843
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,606
<i>The most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar.</i>

844
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,730
In Formula 1 it is known
as the Graveyard.

845
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,569
The weather conditions
are far from ideal,

846
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,250
and latest reports indicate

847
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,039
there is no relief in sight.

848
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:59,919
Gentlemen. Well, gentlemen,
please be quiet.

849
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,082
Thank you. Niki Lauda.

850
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,805
Thank you.

851
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,923
I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

852
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,239
the Nürburgring is the most stupid,
barbaric, outdated

853
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,759
and dangerous track in the world.

854
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,079
You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

855
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,799
Now, those of you with experience know
the ring needs perfect conditions

856
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,451
to be even remotely acceptable
in terms of risk.

857
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,927
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

858
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,199
so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race.

859
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,282
Cancel the race?

860
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,439
There would be no change
to the situation

861
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,919
as far as points is concerned.

862
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,639
- The race would simply be cancelled.
- This is bullshit.

863
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,959
If the race is cancelled,
none of us get our race fees.

864
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,399
That's true, you leave without your fee,
but you might leave with your life.

865
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,644
It also means that you would
effectively win the championship.

866
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,606
So, I can see why
this suits you just fine.

867
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,571
Why? There would be
no points for me either.

868
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,279
No, but there would be one race less

869
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,719
where I, or anyone else here,
could catch you.

870
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,079
James is right. This is just tactics.

871
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,765
Maybe he's just frightened.

872
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,805
Which asshole said this?

873
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,649
Yes, of course I'm frightened,
and so are you.

874
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,599
I accept, every time I get in my car,
there is 20 per cent chance I could die,

875
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,170
and I can live with it,

876
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,319
but not one per cent more.

877
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,641
And today, with the rain,
the risk is more.

878
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,491
I suppose that all depends
on how good you are in the rain.

879
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,839
I have the track record here.

880
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,799
I am the only person in history
to do the ring in under seven minutes.

881
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,485
So, actually, it's to my advantage
to race here today.

882
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,521
Because I'm quicker than all of you.

883
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,848
- Come on.
- Fine. Then let's race.

884
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,847
- Come on, Niki, let's race.
- Gentlemen, please.

885
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,679
Why are we here, Niki? Come on.

886
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,531
Well, all those in favour
of cancelling the race.

887
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,484
All those in favour of racing.

888
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,325
Gentlemen, the race is on.

889
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,321
- Ridiculous.
- What a waste of time.

890
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,564
You know, Niki, every now and then
it helps if people like you.

891
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,079
In places
the track is still dangerously wet,

892
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,599
but following a drivers' meeting,

893
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,199
a decision has finally been taken.

894
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,124
The race is going ahead.

895
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,599
Niki!

896
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,364
<i>One minute to go.</i>

897
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:17,079
Jochen's going on slicks.
You wanna change?

898
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,639
- Is Niki gonna change?
- No.

899
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,722
Then we stay on wets, too.

900
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,324
- Niki, okay?
- I'm good.

901
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,280
All right, fire her up.

902
01:06:49,494 --> 01:06:52,279
<i>This season's fight for
the Formula 1 World Championship</i>

903
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,959
<i>has so far been the story of two men.</i>

904
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,639
<i>Thus far, it's been going
pretty much the way of Niki Lauda.</i>

905
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,325
<i>But James Hunt
has qualified fastest here.</i>

906
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,519
<i>He is on pole position
for the German Grand Prix,</i>

907
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,603
<i>with Niki Lauda alongside
in the blood-red Ferrari.</i>

908
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,519
<i>It's a long race.</i>

909
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,171
If the track starts to dry out,

910
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,124
the wet-weather tyres
will no longer be as quick.

911
01:07:38,535 --> 01:07:40,639
Niki Lauda
and James Hunt, side by side

912
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,803
on the front row of the grid,
go away absolutely as one.

913
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,207
<i>Lauda very aggressive on Hunt there,</i>

914
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,322
<i>forcing the McLaren onto the grass.</i>

915
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,159
<i>Lauda has the lead at the moment.</i>

916
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,527
Lauda leads into the first corner.

917
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,688
<i>Hunt is in second place.</i>

918
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,999
<i>Mass storming past Hunt!</i>

919
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,685
<i>He made the right choice
to go with the dry-weather tyres.</i>

920
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,009
<i>Mass passing Lauda now!</i>

921
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,045
<i>Jochen Mass, in the number 12 McLaren,
takes the lead!</i>

922
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,884
Jochen Mass the clear leader,

923
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,088
with everybody else making the decision

924
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,359
to change tyres
after just one lap of this race.

925
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,567
He's coming in! Come on, let's go!

926
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,770
See? I told you to go on slicks.
You should have taken my advice.

927
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,719
Fuck off. Where's Niki?

928
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,405
Behind you.
He made the same mistake.

929
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,889
Come on!

930
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,249
Come on! What's going on?

931
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,119
The tyre-changing frenzy has caused
a huge reshuffling of the pack,

932
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,090
- with Jochen Mass in the lead now.
- You're clear. Go!

933
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,766
Quick!

934
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,079
Lauda urging his mechanics to hurry.

935
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,241
Quicker, quicker, quicker!

936
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,082
It's a disaster! Come on!

937
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,210
What's going on, you assholes?

938
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,199
This race has gone wrong for him so far.

939
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,647
<i>His championship rival, James Hunt,
is a long way up the road.</i>

940
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,999
<i>Lauda passing car after car.</i>

941
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,482
<i>He's just going past
Mario Andretti's Lotus there.</i>

942
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,202
Niki!

943
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,282
Get me out! Help me!

944
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,440
<i>We have an accident
on the course. Red flags are out.</i>

945
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:33,520
<i>Several cars are involved. Looks like
it might be one of the Ferraris.</i>

946
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,087
- Come this way.
- Come on, come on!

947
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,799
Keep trying.

948
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,040
- Come this way.
- Okay.

949
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,839
<i>The flood, which swept
down Big Thompson Canyon in Colorado,</i>

950
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,559
<i>was the worst since records began.</i>

951
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,159
<i>In Formula 1 today,
victory celebrations were muted</i>

952
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,999
<i>after a horrific accident involving
world champion Niki Lauda.</i>

953
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,999
<i>Due to safety concerns before the race,</i>

954
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,399
<i>the Austrian had said
he would not take part,</i>

955
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,890
<i>but in the end he did.</i>

956
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,567
<i>He was making up for lost time
when he went off the track,</i>

957
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,047
<i>puncturing the Ferrari's fuel tank.</i>

958
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,727
<i>Brett Lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck,</i>

959
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,879
<i>but was unhurt and joined with
the other drivers to rescue Lauda,</i>

960
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,770
<i>who was taken to Mannheim Hospital
with severe burns,</i>

961
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,521
<i>the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of Formula 1.</i>

962
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,719
<i>Niki Lauda was trapped
for almost a minute</i>

963
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,371
<i>in a searing inferno
of 800-plus degrees.</i>

964
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,479
- Do we have any change this morning?
- No...

965
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,403
<i>Frau</i> Lauda. <i>Frau</i> Lauda?

966
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,049
- Morning, chaps.
- Hey, here's the man.

967
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,890
Looking good.

968
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,999
- What's going on?
- Jesus. It's Niki.

969
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,048
- What about him?
- He's here.

970
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,885
- What?
- He's racing.

971
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,890
Niki.

972
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,045
It's that bad, huh?

973
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,771
No.

974
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,639
In hospital I asked them straight,
no bullshit,

975
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,483
how bad my appearance would be.

976
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,087
They said with time it would be fine.

977
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,564
But it won't.

978
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,324
I can tell, seeing your reaction.

979
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:13,284
I will spend the rest of my life
with a face that frightens people.

980
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,166
You know, Niki, I tried to write you
a letter at the time, to apologise.

981
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,280
The drivers' meeting in Germany,
before the race.

982
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,926
- I swayed the room.
- Yes, you did.

983
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,327
That race should never have gone ahead.

984
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,684
No, it shouldn't.

985
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,839
So, in many ways, I feel responsible
for what happened, and...

986
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,410
You were.

987
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,809
But, trust me...

988
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,010
watching you win those races
while I was fighting for my life...

989
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,529
...you were equally responsible
for getting me back in the car.

990
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,965
- How are you feeling, Niki?
- Fine.

991
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,999
Niki, can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures you've had

992
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,002
and the expectations for your recovery?

993
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,005
Sure.

994
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,999
I had a skin graft operation,

995
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,321
where they put half my right thigh
in my face.

996
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:42,359
Now, it doesn't look too good,
but one unexpected advantage is

997
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,719
it's impossible to perspire
through a skin graft,

998
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:48,159
so sweat will never run into my eyes
again, which is good for a driver.

999
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,039
When they heard about your condition,

1000
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:55,487
Ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver, Carlos Reutemann.

1001
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:00,199
Yeah, before even reaching the hospital.

1002
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,248
Is Reutemann
driving today, too?

1003
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,684
Yes, and keen to make an impression.

1004
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,879
So, let's see where Mr Reutemann
finishes and where I finish today.

1005
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,085
James Hunt and McLaren have
caught up a lot while you were away.

1006
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,210
Yes.

1007
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,839
So is there a question now,
or are you just trying to piss me off?

1008
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,849
You still think you can win?

1009
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,079
Yes, of course.

1010
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,082
I have the better car.

1011
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,680
And possibly I'm the better driver.

1012
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,359
But he's a clever guy,
and he's used his time well

1013
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:38,410
while I was lying half-dead in hospital
to win some points.

1014
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,045
And what did your wife say
when she saw your face?

1015
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:52,799
She said, "Sweetie,
you don't need a face to drive."

1016
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,928
"You just need a right foot."

1017
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,607
I'm being serious.

1018
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:02,283
Do you really think your marriage can
survive with the way you look now?

1019
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,968
And I'm being serious, too.

1020
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,930
Fuck you. Press conference over.

1021
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:17,959
- That was hairy.
- Well, you got noticed, Clive.

1022
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,319
I'll tell you that.

1023
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,999
I thought it went well,
to be honest.

1024
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,799
They don't like it
when it's not going their way.

1025
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,484
- Clive.
- That's the game.

1026
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,919
- See you.
- See you later.

1027
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,809
- James, are you all right?
- Good, yeah.

1028
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,679
Listen, I think
I've got something for you

1029
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,479
on that last question, about Niki.

1030
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,086
You heard about that?
I did.

1031
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,049
James.

1032
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,851
Please, James...

1033
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,764
Now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look.

1034
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,611
Prick.

1035
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:16,361
So Niki Lauda, just 42 days after
his near-fatal accident at Nürburgring,

1036
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,039
will race here today at Monza

1037
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:21,806
against all medical advice
and no doubt in incredible pain.

1038
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,239
<i>...Niki Lauda!</i>

1039
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,281
<i>Photographers,
please clear the grid.</i>

1040
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,682
Niki, it's time.

1041
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,690
Okay?

1042
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,771
<i>Please clear the grid.</i>

1043
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,528
<i>One minute to go.</i>

1044
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:14,239
<i>The returning Niki Lauda
seems overwhelmed.</i>

1045
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,686
<i>He's being overtaken by car after car.</i>

1046
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,609
<i>Lauda's off line.
He runs wide onto the grass.</i>

1047
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,124
<i>He wrestles it back onto the track,</i>

1048
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,130
<i>but that was a bad moment for Niki.</i>

1049
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,279
<i>Niki Lauda's the reigning
world champion,</i>

1050
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,489
<i>but maybe in his current state
he's a danger out there,</i>

1051
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,450
<i>to himself and to the rest of the field.</i>

1052
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,331
<i>And Stuck has collided
with Mario Andretti's Lotus!</i>

1053
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,643
<i>Niki's boxed in. He's got nowhere to go.</i>

1054
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:18,641
<i>Niki Lauda is actually
making a move. He's on Brambilla's tail.</i>

1055
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,571
<i>He pulls out of the slipstream
to overtake.</i>

1056
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,641
<i>Lauda's starting to find the form</i>

1057
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,728
<i>that, early in this race,
we believed he'd lost.</i>

1058
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,245
Lauda's now lapping faster than
Reutemann and closing the gap ahead.

1059
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,731
<i>Lauda closing on Carlos Reutemann,</i>

1060
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,003
<i>the man called in to be his replacement
in the Ferrari team.</i>

1061
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,849
<i>And there's James Hunt's McLaren,</i>

1062
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,406
<i>smoking stationary
by the side of the road.</i>

1063
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,123
<i>This is bad news for Hunt's
championship hopes.</i>

1064
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,931
<i>It's Ronnie Peterson</i>

1065
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,407
<i>who comes home the winner here at Monza.</i>

1066
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,490
<i>But all eyes are on the man
who finishes a brilliant fourth,</i>

1067
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,568
<i>Niki Lauda!</i>

1068
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,839
<i>What a race, what a man,
what a season.</i>

1069
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,079
With a fourth-place finish
and three priceless points,

1070
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,119
it means that Niki Lauda
is a major step closer

1071
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,327
to retaining the World Championship.

1072
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:17,039
<i>So, the long, gruelling
and incredibly dramatic season</i>

1073
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,479
<i>comes down to this final race in Japan</i>

1074
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:22,079
<i>in the shadow of Mount Fuji.</i>

1075
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,559
<i>Niki Lauda goes into</i>

1076
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,079
<i>this deciding race at Fuji</i>

1077
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,319
<i>just three points ahead of James Hunt.</i>

1078
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:31,609
<i>Hunt knowing he must beat the Austrian
fair and square to take the title.</i>

1079
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:36,719
James, do you think
you can cope with the pressure?

1080
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:40,247
Well, I've never really understood
what that means. I love my job.

1081
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,408
I love competing. I love racing.

1082
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,519
<i>Maybe you should ask Niki.</i>

1083
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,879
He's the World Champion.
He's got everything to lose.

1084
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,279
Mr Lauda,
are you feeling pressure?

1085
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,726
Do I look like I'm feeling pressure?

1086
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,930
I am World Champion, and on the verge
to become World Champion again.

1087
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,119
Hunt now has the opportunity to win,

1088
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,279
but it's not so easy
to become a champion.

1089
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,409
You have to really believe it
to make it possible.

1090
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,608
James, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1091
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:11,719
If Niki is being tricky and getting
a kicky out of playing mind games...

1092
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,087
...then fine, I'm flattered.

1093
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:17,761
But the fact is, momentum is with me.
I've never felt better.

1094
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,451
And I fully expect the next
press conference we will have

1095
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,722
will be with me as World Champion.

1096
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,079
How will you cope
with the weather, bad conditions?

1097
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,639
Intermittent heavy rain
has been forecast here at Fuji today,

1098
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:34,122
along with strong winds
and occasional fog

1099
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,129
rolling in from the mountain.

1100
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,639
<i>And so, with today's
Japanese Grand Prix to come,</i>

1101
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,479
<i>Lauda's lead a mere three points.</i>

1102
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,164
<i>What a way to finish the season.</i>

1103
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,319
<i>Hunt or Lauda?</i>

1104
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,324
<i>Well, the final chapter will unfold when
we bring you extended coverage...</i>

1105
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,559
They've got to cancel the race.
It's lethal out there.

1106
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,759
The race is going ahead.

1107
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,679
Television rights have been sold
all around the world.

1108
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,399
The showdown between you and Niki
is all anyone wants to see.

1109
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,879
With heavy rain
continuing to fall here at Fuji,

1110
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,962
a decision has finally been made.

1111
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:09,079
The 1976 Japanese Grand Prix
will go ahead.

1112
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,765
<i>All drivers
to your cars, please.</i>

1113
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,811
<i>Five minutes to go.</i>

1114
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,519
- All right?
- All right.

1115
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,919
- Hold still.
- What the hell are you doing?

1116
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,719
To let the condensation out.

1117
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:29,519
- It'll also let the water in.
- Not if you're leading.

1118
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,887
Trust me,
this race is all about the start.

1119
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,371
- Need a hand here?
- Yeah, hold it, Teddy.

1120
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,490
Okay, start the bastard.

1121
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,130
Good luck, kid.

1122
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,931
Good luck, James.

1123
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,482
<i>Thirty seconds to go.</i>

1124
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,159
<i>Electric tension here at Fuji.</i>

1125
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:08,279
<i>80, 000 bedraggled race fans and
the racing grudge match of the decade.</i>

1126
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,479
<i>And there's Mario Andretti
in pole position,</i>

1127
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,482
<i>James Hunt alongside him.</i>

1128
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,639
<i>On Row 2 of the grid,</i>

1129
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,599
<i>there is Niki Lauda,</i>

1130
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,119
<i>and on Row 3 of the grid,
Jody Scheckter from South Africa</i>

1131
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,639
<i>in the six-wheel Tyrrell.</i>

1132
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,722
<i>Behind him,
the rest of the 25-car field.</i>

1133
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,565
There's the flag, and finally
the Japanese Grand Prix is underway!

1134
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,039
<i>In these conditions,
it must be almost impossible to drive</i>

1135
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,042
<i>a 450-horsepower car.</i>

1136
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,279
<i>And it's Andretti who has the lead,
but Hunt is attacking.</i>

1137
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:37,319
<i>Hunt's going round
the outside of Andretti.</i>

1138
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:38,959
<i>Niki Lauda following him through.</i>

1139
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,725
<i>Hunt leads into the first right-hander.</i>

1140
01:37:24,255 --> 01:37:26,599
<i>Hunt comes through
to complete his first lap,</i>

1141
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,079
<i>leading the field.</i>

1142
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,208
<i>At least he has clear vision
in front of him.</i>

1143
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,482
<i>Niki Lauda, behind him,
eating his spray.</i>

1144
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,439
<i>Lauda is slowing.</i>

1145
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,399
<i>Niki Lauda is bringing
the Ferrari number one into the pit.</i>

1146
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,289
<i>Some sort of problem, we can't
imagine what, so early in the race.</i>

1147
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,047
What's wrong with the car?
What's wrong with the car?

1148
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,929
Niki, what's wrong with the car?

1149
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,362
Nothing. Car's perfect.

1150
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,199
- What are you doing?
- I'm stopping.

1151
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,439
<i>His mechanics
are asking what the problem is.</i>

1152
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,761
<i>But wait!
Niki Lauda's getting out of the car!</i>

1153
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:29,559
This is sensational!

1154
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:32,484
The reigning World Champion,
Niki Lauda, is out of this race.

1155
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,159
It's too dangerous.

1156
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:38,369
Niki, you want me to say there was
a problem with the car, for the media?

1157
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,170
No.

1158
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,971
Tell them the truth.

1159
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,410
<i>Now, what is happening?</i>

1160
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,445
<i>They're talking to the team manager.
Lauda explaining something.</i>

1161
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,359
<i>With Lauda out, James Hunt
knows he has to finish this race</i>

1162
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:12,199
<i>in third place or higher
to be World Champion.</i>

1163
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,959
<i>But the job's not done yet
for James Hunt.</i>

1164
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,568
<i>In these dreadful conditions,
he still has to go the distance.</i>

1165
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,523
<i>Fifteen laps to go here at Fuji.</i>

1166
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,799
<i>James Hunt or Niki Lauda?</i>

1167
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,959
<i>This extraordinary season
is not over yet.</i>

1168
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:31,407
<i>In this treacherous final round,
can James Hunt hang on?</i>

1169
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,839
<i>And the scoreboard tells a story.</i>

1170
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,650
<i>Lap 58. Hunt in the lead.</i>

1171
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,483
Oh, God, his tyres, they're blistering.

1172
01:39:41,895 --> 01:39:43,959
<i>Brambilla
very close behind now,</i>

1173
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,928
<i>closing on him all the time now.</i>

1174
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:49,279
<i>And he's trying to drive
inside James Hunt.</i>

1175
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,806
<i>Hunt cuts across the orange March nose.</i>

1176
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,279
<i>Hunt's not having that at all.
And he's spinning.</i>

1177
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,519
<i>He missed Hunt there, but almost
took James Hunt out of the race</i>

1178
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,959
<i>and out of the world championship.</i>

1179
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,691
<i>Now we find Mario Andretti
closing on James Hunt.</i>

1180
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,208
<i>Mario Andretti's going past Hunt!</i>

1181
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,684
<i>Hunt is slowing. James Hunt
seems to have a problem.</i>

1182
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,359
<i>Despite these wet conditions,</i>

1183
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:22,089
<i>these wet-weather tyres
do wear extremely fast.</i>

1184
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,328
Hunt's tyres, they've gone.

1185
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,246
<i>Hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop.</i>

1186
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,288
<i>That back marker's going past Hunt.</i>

1187
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:47,479
<i>Look at that left front tyre...
Right front tyre, sorry.</i>

1188
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,643
<i>No tread on it at all.
And the other one is flat.</i>

1189
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,928
Let's go! Let's go!

1190
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,959
Okay? When did you break
your gear lever?

1191
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,639
Nine or ten laps ago.

1192
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:04,086
- Alastair, we need to lift it.
- Come on!

1193
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,959
- At the front.
- Let's go.

1194
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:09,239
<i>Regazzoni's Ferrari
and Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier</i>

1195
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:10,890
have gone ahead.

1196
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,679
Come on, hurry!

1197
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:15,799
You did it.
You're going to be World Champion!

1198
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,319
Not yet.

1199
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:21,159
<i>A few laps ago, James Hunt
was looking like champion elect.</i>

1200
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,527
<i>Now it looks as though
it's all gone wrong for him.</i>

1201
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,439
- James.
- Come on!

1202
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,959
- Listen.
- What?

1203
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,279
Just go easy out there.

1204
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:34,319
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying look after yourself.

1205
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,279
We want you back in one piece.

1206
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:39,719
You're too far back. There's
too many drivers in front of you.

1207
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:43,725
- There's always next year.
- So that's it? It's over?

1208
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:45,679
Clear!

1209
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,205
James.

1210
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,803
- Clear!
- Fuck it!

1211
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:58,039
James Hunt rejoins the race
in sixth position.

1212
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:01,931
<i>There are four laps left to go.
Surely no way back for the Brit now.</i>

1213
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,134
Concentrate, Superstar.

1214
01:42:23,135 --> 01:42:25,039
<i>Just brings
it back under control.</i>

1215
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,319
<i>Sliding the McLaren</i>

1216
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,560
<i>on the very edge there.</i>

1217
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,766
<i>Hunt's M23</i>

1218
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,559
<i>twitching this way and that
under braking.</i>

1219
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,960
And he almost loses it right there.

1220
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,801
<i>Hunt on the tail
of Jacques Lafitte in the blue Ligier.</i>

1221
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,171
Oh, don't do it, James.

1222
01:42:49,295 --> 01:42:51,239
<i>He's inches away
from the pit wall.</i>

1223
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,049
<i>He's inches away from the Ligier.</i>

1224
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,559
<i>James Hunt has made up another place,</i>

1225
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,639
<i>but it's not enough,</i>

1226
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:06,880
<i>and this race is running out.</i>

1227
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,922
<i>And Watson has spun.
Watson has spun.</i>

1228
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,399
<i>Hunt manages to weave his way
between that back marker</i>

1229
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,479
<i>and the stationary Penske.</i>

1230
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,559
He's catching Regazzoni

1231
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,279
but, in these conditions,
it's one thing to catch up,

1232
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,487
it's quite another to overtake.

1233
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,010
<i>He's alongside Clay Regazzoni.
This could be the world championship.</i>

1234
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:50,965
<i>He's got him!</i>

1235
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,399
<i>Hunt crosses the line.</i>

1236
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:12,079
<i>Now, he needed to finish third to score
enough points to be World Champion,</i>

1237
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:16,679
<i>and in the confusion here, we're being
told that he may have finished fifth.</i>

1238
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,879
He finished fifth?

1239
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:21,759
<i>Our lap charts
show Hunt in third place.</i>

1240
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,759
<i>Well, if the scoreboard's right,</i>

1241
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,359
<i>it means he's just missed out
on the championship.</i>

1242
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:30,001
<i>Crushing defeat for Hunt
after such a heroic drive.</i>

1243
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,559
I can see the race stewards conferring,

1244
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,279
examining the official lap charts.

1245
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,681
<i>We're just going to have to wait
for their verdict here.</i>

1246
01:44:58,295 --> 01:44:59,959
Let's get you out of there, buddy.

1247
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,119
I'm sorry, Teddy. I'm sorry.
I thought I could make up the ground.

1248
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:04,279
Sorry? What are you talking about?
You did it.

1249
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:07,119
- Did what?
- Jesus. You crazy bastard.

1250
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:10,329
You came third. You got the points.
You're champion of the world!

1251
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:14,083
<i>James Hunt
is now officially confirmed</i>

1252
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,248
<i>as finishing third here in Japan,</i>

1253
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:20,599
<i>and that means
he is champion of the world.</i>

1254
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,359
<i>Our new World Champion,
James Hunt, by just one single point.</i>

1255
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,970
<i>Did we really win?</i>

1256
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,281
World bloody Champion!

1257
01:45:48,975 --> 01:45:51,039
Tell us, James,
what are you going to do now?

1258
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,202
I shall be getting drunk.

1259
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:56,519
It's wonderful,
an absolute dream...

1260
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,519
<i>And our special guest,</i>

1261
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,363
<i>Formula 1 champion James Hunt.</i>

1262
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:12,842
Wait. Come on.

1263
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,559
<i>There's no better motor oil</i>

1264
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,164
<i>than Havoline.</i>

1265
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:31,679
Yes, me, too.
Where are we going?

1266
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,214
Anywhere I want to go.

1267
01:47:33,215 --> 01:47:35,559
And I don't have to hijack it, either.

1268
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:37,279
As long as I pay for it.

1269
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,601
I'm starving.
Let's get some food.

1270
01:47:50,415 --> 01:47:52,519
- Where are we going?
- You lot go ahead.

1271
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,488
I won't be a minute.

1272
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,004
Good to see you.

1273
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,481
I heard you were spending
more and more time in one of these.

1274
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,848
Do you fly?
No.

1275
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:12,730
I don't think they'd insure me.

1276
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,723
You should try.
It's good for discipline.

1277
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:17,400
You have to stay within the rules,
stick to regulations,

1278
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,091
suppress the ego.
It helps with the racing.

1279
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:23,239
And there I was thinking
you were about to wax lyrical

1280
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:24,844
about the romance of flight.

1281
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,770
No, that's all bullshit.

1282
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,365
So, what brings you here?

1283
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:33,079
A friend's wedding.
At least I think it was a wedding.

1284
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,999
Might have been a birthday or something.
It's all a bit of a blur.

1285
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,319
How about you? Have you been at Fiorano?

1286
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:38,481
Pre-season testing.

1287
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,599
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

1288
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,839
I'm not sure that was meant
as a compliment.

1289
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,159
When do you start testing? Next week?

1290
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:47,199
No. What, are you nuts?

1291
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:48,999
I didn't just win
the biggest thing of my life

1292
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,445
so I could get right back to work.

1293
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:54,445
Why? You have to.

1294
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:58,199
To prove to all the people who will
always say you just won it because...

1295
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:01,602
Because of what?
Because of your accident?

1296
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,168
Niki, is that other people,
or is that you?

1297
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:08,959
I won, okay? On the all-important day,
when it came down to it,

1298
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,879
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

1299
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,119
And I put my life on the line,
and I saw it through.

1300
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:16,168
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

1301
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,362
The risks were totally unacceptable.

1302
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,360
You were prepared to die.
To me, that's losing.

1303
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:23,119
Yes, I was. I admit it.

1304
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,999
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

1305
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,970
And that's the effect you have on me.
You'd pushed me that far.

1306
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,491
And it felt great.

1307
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,799
I mean, hell,
isn't that what we're in this for?

1308
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:37,168
To stare death in the face
and to cheat it?

1309
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,320
Come on, there's nobility in that.
It's... It's like being knights.

1310
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,084
You English, you're such assholes.

1311
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,485
You know my position.

1312
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:48,239
Twenty per cent risk.

1313
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:52,039
No, no, no, Niki, don't bring the
percentages into this. Don't be a pro.

1314
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:54,691
The minute you do that,
you kill what's good about this.

1315
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,764
You kill the sport.

1316
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:01,530
James!

1317
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,683
- James!
- Come on!

1318
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:08,045
I've got to go.

1319
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,528
Careful in this thing.

1320
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,050
James.

1321
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:23,046
You know, in hospital, the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum.

1322
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:26,284
Pumping the shit out of my lungs.
It was hell.

1323
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,283
And while doing it,
I was watching television.

1324
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:32,719
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

1325
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,927
"That bastard Hunt," I would say.
"I hate that guy."

1326
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:37,639
And then one day
the doctor came and said,

1327
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,927
"Mr Lauda,
may I offer a piece of advice?"

1328
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,799
"Stop thinking of it as a curse to
have been given an enemy in life."

1329
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:46,039
"It can be a blessing, too."

1330
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,805
"A wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends."

1331
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,727
And you know what? He was right.

1332
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:58,119
Look at us. We were both
a pair of kids when we met.

1333
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,959
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

1334
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,803
Disowned by our families.

1335
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,285
Headed nowhere.

1336
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,759
And now we're both
champions of the world.

1337
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,171
It was not bad, huh?

1338
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,239
No, it's not bad.

1339
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:14,801
So, don't let me down now.
I need you busting my balls.

1340
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:18,005
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

1341
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:20,808
But I intend to enjoy myself first.

1342
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:23,481
Some of life needs to be for pleasure.

1343
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:26,999
What's the point of having
a million cups and medals and planes

1344
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,162
if you don't have any fun?

1345
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:31,689
How is that winning?

1346
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:35,491
- James!
- We're gonna leave without you!

1347
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,445
James!

1348
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,691
I'll see you on race day, champ.

1349
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:46,602
You will... champ.

1350
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:50,884
You look good, Niki.

1351
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:54,330
The only guy to have his face burnt off
and it be an improvement.

1352
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:03,279
<i>Of course,
he didn't listen to me.</i>

1353
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,799
<i>For James,</i>

1354
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,999
<i>one world title was enough.</i>

1355
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,519
<i>He had proved</i>

1356
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:11,879
<i>what he needed to prove, to himself</i>

1357
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:14,167
<i>and anyone who doubted him.</i>

1358
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,889
<i>And two years later he retired.</i>

1359
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:20,801
<i>When I saw him next in London
seven years later,</i>

1360
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:23,048
<i>me as champion again,</i>

1361
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:25,119
<i>him as broadcaster,</i>

1362
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:29,523
<i>he was barefoot
on a bicycle with a flat tyre.</i>

1363
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:32,484
<i>Still living each day like his last.</i>

1364
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:35,730
<i>When I heard he'd died,</i>

1365
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,207
<i>aged 45, of a heart attack,</i>

1366
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,845
<i>I wasn't surprised.</i>

1367
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,729
<i>I was just sad.</i>

1368
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,999
<i>People always think of us as rivals,</i>

1369
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,607
<i>but he was among the very few I liked,</i>

1370
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:53,890
<i>and even fewer that I respected.</i>

1371
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,771
<i>He remains the only person I envied.</i>

1372
01:53:00,305 --> 01:54:00,633
