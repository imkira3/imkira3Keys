2
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,161
Great. Keep it coming.
Chuck, Terry, pump away.

3
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,329
Don't be stingy.

4
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,457
Okay, watch that arm.
I can see that fake arm.

5
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,250
Chase, keep that claw really moving.

6
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,295
Jeffrey, jam it on there just like
Freddy would. Good. Good.

7
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:29,130
And cut. Print that, Gretchen.

8
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,967
Thank you, sir. Printing seven only.

9
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,764
You're a genius. This makes his old claw
look like Mother Teresa's mitten.

10
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,266
You better thank them,
they're very sensitive.

11
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,352
- Chuck, Terry, great blood.
- Thank you very much.

12
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,021
Some of our best work.

13
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,898
Monkey man,
wanna see some neat stuff?

14
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,065
- Yeah!
- Chase.

15
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,859
Oh, come on.

16
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,152
It's only make-believe.

17
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,447
- Marianne, I gotta go.
- Okay.

18
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,661
Low bridge.

19
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:07,627
We'll see if we can't find someone's
to scare the pj's off of Mommy.

20
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,173
Hey, Heather.

21
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,350
You hungry, Dylan?

22
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,565
Ooh, gotcha.

23
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,025
It should have flexed more.

24
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:34,779
Chase, I think the servos
got shorted out with blood.

25
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:39,867
Well, take it apart, pull it out,
and insulate them with some styro.

26
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,079
Thing wasn't meant to be submerged,
for Pete's sake.

27
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,122
I don't like that thing.

28
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,833
It puts bread on our table.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,793
Is it alive, Daddy?

30
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,754
Heather, you're in the next shot.

31
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,007
State-of-the-art animatronics
enhanced with bio-organic grafting.

32
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,259
Bull tendons.

33
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,011
- Nerve bundles from a live Doberman.
- Chase.

34
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,185
Whoa.

35
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,276
Shit, Chuck!

36
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:17,572
Uh, it must have picked up a signal
from an AD's walkie-talkie.

37
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,615
- You sure it's turned off?
- It's off.

38
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,035
It's funny, it's warm,
just like a real hand.

39
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,833
Oh, God.

40
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,297
What the hell is going on?
Cut the effects!

41
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,053
Chase!

42
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,306
Terry, where is it?

43
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,765
Terry!

44
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,475
Chuck, get off me!

45
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,227
Heather!

46
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,771
- Heather, where is it?
- Chase, where the hell is it?

47
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,401
Dylan!

48
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,861
Come on!

49
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,328
What the fuck?

50
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,417
Dylan.

51
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,965
Chase! No!

52
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,760
Earthquake. Come on.

53
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,185
Mommy!

54
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,686
Dylan!

55
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,192
Dylan! Dylan!

56
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,364
Dylan!

57
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,052
What is that?

58
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,887
Car alarms.

59
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,143
- You okay?
- Yeah.

60
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,313
You okay, chief?

61
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,982
- No.
- Heh, heh.

62
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,776
- Honey, do you have a fever?
- Just another earthquake, Dylan.

63
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,029
- Getting kind of fun, huh?
- Daddy, blood.

64
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,241
It's nothing, guys.

65
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,119
It's a scratch. Really.

66
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,787
Where did you get that?

67
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,374
I don't know. Picture, I guess.
The one that fell.

68
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,834
It's no big deal.

69
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,961
Put a bandage on it.

70
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,046
Don't worry about it.

71
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,092
Whoo!

72
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,973
Geologists at Caltech have confirmed...

73
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,643
that this morning's aftershock...
- Do we have to watch that?

74
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,689
- You turned it on.
- It caused further collapse...

75
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,108
of the already badly damaged
parking structure...

76
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,610
I'll turn it off.

77
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,781
This is normal, following a quake
of last week's magnitude...

78
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,659
now thought to be a massive 6.8.

79
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,956
Dylan, this is breakfast,
not arts and crafts.

80
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,207
Grr.

81
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,876
What?

82
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,919
Did you get any sleep last night?

83
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,213
More or less.

84
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,258
Okay, time to get dressed. I'm late.

85
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,093
You're going away?

86
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,472
Just for a few hours.
Julie will be with you.

87
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,064
Is there anything other than the obvious
bothering you?

88
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,650
I think five earthquakes in three weeks
is enough, sweetie.

89
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,154
Hasn't been another phone call,
has there?

90
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,655
No.

91
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:51,035
Good sign. Two full weeks without him.

92
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,411
Maybe he got hit by a truck.

93
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,331
He's closer, if anything.

94
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,750
It's giving me nightmares, Chase.

95
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,294
Did you have one last night?

96
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,091
Ah, it's just the earthquakes, Heather.

97
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,842
Maybe.

98
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,428
Maybe I shouldn't do
this interview today.

99
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:14,558
No. You've gotta get back
on the horse sometime.

100
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,770
Look, you had a nutcase
making harassing phone calls.

101
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:22,191
- I know how scary that's been.
- No, you don't.

102
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,070
Okay. I don't.

103
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,656
But it doesn't mean
that it can't be over.

104
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,450
Yeah, but what if it isn't over?

105
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,955
Maybe you should tell me your dream.

106
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,625
Oh, it was nothing. It was...

107
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,045
You and I were working on this movie,
together for once...

108
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,715
and one of your special effects
went really wrong.

109
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,428
And Chuck and Terry got hurt...

110
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,933
and, heh, well, your fingers were cut.

111
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,269
Right here?

112
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,854
Ooh!

113
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,024
Heather, you were probably half-awake...

114
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,862
and saw my fingers get nicked
when the mirror fell. Dreams are like that.

115
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,327
Look, if you don't want me
to go on this job, I won't.

116
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,124
Pfft! Just be careful, okay?

117
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,043
I think I can survive two days
in Palm Springs...

118
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,921
supplying soap bubbles
for a detergent commercial, don't you?

119
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,256
I guess so.

120
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,091
- You guess so?
- Yeah.

121
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,634
Come here.

122
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,771
Mmm. Forty eight hours.

123
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,816
I'll be back in no time.

124
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,736
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

125
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,281
Hey!

126
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,287
I love what you've done with the place.

127
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,957
Knock them dead.

128
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,296
Dylan, I gotta go! Take care of Mommy.

129
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,464
Bye.

130
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,656
Nancy.

131
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,450
Dylan.

132
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,703
Nancy.

133
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,540
Dylan, I don't want you watching this.

134
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,422
What? What's wrong?
What's gotten into you?

135
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,105
Hello?

136
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,024
One, two...

137
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,539
- Hello?
- Freddy's coming for you!

138
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,627
Chase!

139
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,848
Someone's coming.

140
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,224
What?

141
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,201
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yes.

142
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,042
Heather!

143
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,175
Hey.

144
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,094
Is everything okay?

145
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,097
Yeah. Just these quakes.
Did you feel a little one just now?

146
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,600
Oh, no. A truck went by
right before you opened the door.

147
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,769
That's life on the fault line.

148
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,604
- Hey, tiger.
- Hi, Julie.

149
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,272
Oh!

150
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,276
Does he feel warm to you?
He had a fever this morning, I think.

151
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,696
Hmm. No. He seems okay.

152
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,366
Are you sure that's all that's wrong?
You seem...

153
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,329
Leave us alone, you son of a bitch!

154
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,289
L.A. Limousine, ma'am.

155
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,125
Just wanted you to know I'm out front.

156
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,134
I'm sorry! Can you hang on a minute?

157
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,685
Heather.

158
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,816
- What is it?
- I don't know.

159
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,943
I just have this weird feeling today.

160
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,611
Mommy...

161
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,781
stay home, then.
- Dylan.

162
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,414
This damn caller.

163
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,459
He started again?

164
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,462
Sick fuck.

165
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,215
Sorry.

166
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,302
You know, Dylan doesn't
seem to have a fever.

167
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,847
It's probably just your nerves.

168
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,348
Nerves?

169
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,436
I just meant from the shaker
this morning.

170
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,230
I mean, everybody's freaked out
about how many we've been having.

171
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,565
And then these phone calls.

172
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,612
Don't answer it.

173
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,373
- Hello?
- Excuse me, ma'am...

174
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,126
but we are going to be late.
- Okay.

175
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,930
Dylan?

176
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,308
I gotta go. Forgive me?

177
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,602
Bye.

178
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,702
I'll, uh, call the cops for you.
You've got the number on the fridge, right?

179
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,414
Just give them the time they called
and they're keeping this list, supposedly.

180
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,416
Oh, Julie.

181
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,002
I'm really sorry.
My nerves are a little raw.

182
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,712
It's okay.

183
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,346
Yeah. I gotta go.

184
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,307
- Morning.
- Good morning.

185
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,074
You play that girl?

186
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:31,078
In that movie.
With the guy with the pfft!

187
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,290
Yeah, sure. That's you.

188
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,253
Ah, that's what I love about this job.
I get to meet the stars.

189
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,421
I'm hardly a star.

190
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,173
What? Are you kidding?

191
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,343
I love your stuff.

192
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,679
The first was the best.

193
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,974
Your girlfriend's cut open
and dragged across the ceiling.

194
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,141
It was awesome.

195
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,852
When that blood comes out
of your boyfriend's bed?

196
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,730
Yeah, I thought I'd shit.

197
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,400
But they never should have
killed off Freddy!

198
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,194
Heather, look, we gotta go! Let's go!

199
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,614
Come on. Cutting it close, aren't you?
Trying to get me fired?

200
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,658
Okay, okay, okay! We're coming!

201
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,952
We're coming. No! No! No!

202
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,163
So, Heather, we're approaching
the 10th anniversary...

203
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,124
of this Nightmare on Elm Street thing.

204
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,419
I mean the original five
very popular sequels.

205
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:25,424
How has all this success
affected you personally?

206
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,969
Well, I don't know if it really has, Sam.
Oh, God.

207
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,222
With the exception of 1 and 3,
I pretty much stayed out of it.

208
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,641
You know, I'm doing a lot
more television now.

209
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,603
Those hours let me spend more time
with my husband and my little boy.

210
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,938
That's right, you have a little boy.
What's his name?

211
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,733
Dylan.

212
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,279
With Dylan, does that change your feeling,
your perspective about horror movies?

213
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,031
No, not really.

214
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,991
Would you let him see
one of your movies?

215
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,285
My son? Heh, no.

216
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,537
I'm sure people always ask you this
all the time.

217
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,748
Is there going to be another sequel?

218
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,668
And what's more, is Freddy really dead?

219
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,421
Of course he is. Freddy's dead and gone.

220
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,175
How about your co-star in the original,
in Nightmare 1?

221
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,552
Would you trust him alone with Dylan?

222
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,305
Robert? Heh. I don't know.

223
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,724
Why don't we ask him
how he'd feel about it?

224
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,227
We've got a big surprise for you,
Heather. And for our audience.

225
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,813
Let's bring him out,
he is the best of the bad.

226
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,149
Let's say hello to Robert Englund!

227
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,575
Ha, ha!

228
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,869
Love you, babe!

229
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,163
We'll do lunch! Ha!

230
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,336
All right! Yeah!

231
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,714
Freddy's back!
Give it up for your Uncle Freddy!

232
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,595
Just when you thought it was safe
to get back into bed!

233
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,141
Give me five!

234
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:06,358
I'm back and I'm badder than ever!

235
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:10,278
Freddy! Freddy! Freddy!

236
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,950
Ha! You are all my children now!

237
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,668
- We've gotta go, Robert.
- Um, just a second. I'll walk you.

238
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,878
- There you go, Christy.
- Thank you!

239
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,047
Bye-bye!
- Thank you!

240
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,258
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

241
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,719
I don't know.
Everything went great, I thought.

242
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,597
- We really got you, didn't we?
- I don't know why you didn't tell me.

243
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,934
Come on, they loved
the expression on your face.

244
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,563
- They'd like to see us together again.
- In what, a romantic comedy?

245
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:49,109
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean
you can't have a decapitation or two.

246
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,487
- Heather, there's a call for you.
- For me?

247
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,699
- Listen, I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye.
- Bye-Bye.

248
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:56,908
Hello?

249
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,995
Heather, it's Sara Risher
over at New Line Cinema.

250
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,288
How are you?

251
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,082
Hi, Sara. How are you?
This is a voice from the past.

252
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,335
It sure is. Well, listen, Heather,
I won't take but a minute.

253
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,755
It's just that we have something
to propose to you...

254
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,925
and I wonder if you'd stop by the offices.
Bob would love to talk to you.

255
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,177
Well, sure. When?

256
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,679
No time like the present.
The car will bring you over.

257
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,389
- Now?
- Just take a minute.

258
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,434
You'll be glad you did, I bet. Bye.

259
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,669
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Bob Shaye.

260
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,171
Was Bob expecting you?

261
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,466
- Heather? Hi.
- Sara, how are you?

262
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,718
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Great to see you.

263
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,261
- You look great.
- Thank you.

264
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,138
Bob is dying to see you.

265
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,766
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Coffee would be fine.

266
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,226
- Black?
- Black's fine.

267
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,769
Kim, could you get us some coffee?

268
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,479
- Sure.
- Thanks.

269
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,648
I think the guy's a little bit of a jerk...

270
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,817
but we won't know
until we've read the script.

271
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,862
Anyhow, I'll give you a call when I...
Hey! Listen, man, I gotta go.

272
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,198
- Thanks.
- Call me when you get to Milan.

273
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,618
And don't forget, risotto con tartufo.
It's fantastico.

274
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,954
Take care, man.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

275
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,833
Boy, do you look great, Heather.
How are you?

276
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,210
Great. I'm fine.

277
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,629
I don't have to ask how you're doing.

278
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,172
Well, so far, so good.

279
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,050
Which, by the way,
is why we asked you to come by today.

280
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,053
- Ah, thanks, Kim.
- Sure.

281
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,890
Look, Heather,
let me cut to the chase.

282
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:48,019
How would you like to join us
in the definitive Nightmare?

283
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,273
I thought you killed Freddy off.

284
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,276
Well, we did, but the fans...

285
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,529
You know, the fans, God bless them,
they're clamoring for more.

286
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,614
I guess evil never dies, right?

287
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,700
Anyhow, a few weeks ago
I got a call from Wes...

288
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,785
and he pitched me
this really exciting idea.

289
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:08,206
I started thinking, "Who better
to resurrect Freddy than his creator?"

290
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,293
Well, I thought Wes stopped doing
horror movies.

291
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,462
Do you know he actually told me
he hadn't called in the last 10 years...

292
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,924
because he hadn't had any
really scary nightmares.

293
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,719
They're his inspiration for this thing.

294
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,889
Anyhow, he's right
in the middle of the script.

295
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,391
Which means he's having
nightmares again.

296
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,226
Well, he's very excited about it.

297
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,478
- The nightmares?
- No, sweetie, the script.

298
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:35,275
And you should be too,
because you're the star.

299
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,945
I don't know, Bob.

300
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,823
I'm flattered, really.

301
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,451
- But I have a kid now and...
- Well, so?

302
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,662
So I'm not sure about doing horror.

303
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,873
Oh, come on, Heather. Kids love horror.

304
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,377
Thank you so much, Bob.

305
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,963
I have other things happening.

306
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,716
I promise you we'll match any offer
that's on the table.

307
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,927
No. It's not that.

308
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,261
Look, I have a fan.

309
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,681
You've got plenty of fans. We've been
doing marketing research on you.

310
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,225
You are rating right up there.

311
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,686
We've got Chase working on
a prototype for the new glove.

312
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,521
- It's really...
- What?

313
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,399
Okay, I know, we asked him
to keep it as a surprise...

314
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,903
until you and I could
have this conversation.

315
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,197
Bob...

316
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,575
how long has Wes
been working on this script?

317
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,828
I don't know. A couple months. Why?

318
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,040
Since you've been thinking of making it,
has anything funny happened?

319
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,003
- What do you mean?
- Well, like weird phone calls?

320
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,802
Or nightmares?

321
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,140
Why don't you answer your phone, Bob?

322
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,103
Come on. That's what we've got
people we pay around here for.

323
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,772
Will someone pick up the damn phone?

324
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,373
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

325
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,127
Dylan?

326
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,984
Never sleep again.

327
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,821
Never sleep again.

328
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,909
What is going on?

329
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,245
You didn't let him watch
the movie on TV, did you?

330
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,999
Movie? He didn't watch anything on TV.

331
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,960
He was taking his nap,
and I heard him screaming.

332
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,964
Honey, are you okay?

333
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,676
Mm-hm. Rex saved me.

334
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,809
He did?

335
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,692
Is Rex going to die?

336
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,652
No!

337
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,780
Rex is not going to die.

338
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,282
I promise you, sweetie.

339
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,038
Do you know where the sewing stuff is
in the kitchen?

340
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,790
Sure.

341
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,627
We'll do an operation, okay? Come on.

342
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,004
Dr. Dylan and Dr. Julie.

343
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:47,175
Fix him up good as new, okay? Okay.

344
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:59,687
- Hey, Chase, you got a call!
- It's your wife.

345
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,155
- Heather.
- Chase, hi. You better come home.

346
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,658
Oh, Heather, I'm stuck here.

347
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,035
Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.

348
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,620
Why? What's the matter?

349
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,164
- Chase, it's Dylan.
- What?

350
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,544
Hold on. The phone's breaking up.

351
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:27,882
Okay. What's going on with Dylan?

352
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,636
He's had some sort of an episode.

353
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,931
What? What kind of episode?

354
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:38,309
He was just acting very strangely...

355
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,020
like somebody was after him.

356
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,274
It's scary. It scared me.

357
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,902
- He was acting like...
- Like what?

358
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,655
Like Freddy.

359
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:55,618
Heather, has there been
another phone call?

360
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,999
Chase, why didn't you tell me
you were working on a new glove?

361
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,418
And why aren't Chuck and Terry
at work today?

362
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,670
Forget those clowns, Heather.
Answer me.

363
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,797
Has there been another
phone call today or not?

364
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,719
Yes.

365
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,055
Okay.

366
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,100
I'm coming home.
I'll be there in three hours.

367
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,730
Danny, I gotta go.

368
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,649
- What's up, Chase?
- My kid's sick. I gotta fly.

369
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,794
"As soon as the sun was up..."

370
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,297
the witch made Gretel
fetch wood and kindle a fire.

371
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,299
'We will bake cookies first, ' she said.

372
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,635
'I've heated the oven
and kneaded the dough.

373
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,971
Crawl in and see if the fire
is blazing high enough now.'

374
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,057
As she pushed Gretel
toward the oven...

375
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,602
"...the witch meant to shut the door
and bake her once she was inside."

376
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,103
Dylan, this is so violent.

377
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,899
I don't know why you like
these stupid old fairy tales.

378
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,442
Finish, please.

379
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,110
They're gonna give you nightmares.

380
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,820
I like this story.

381
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,743
"But Gretel guessed
what the witch was planning."

382
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:22,205
'I don't know how to get in, ' Gretel said.
'How am I to manage it?'

383
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:25,500
'Stupid girl, ' shouted the witch
rushing up to the oven.

384
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:28,836
'The opening is big enough.
See, I can fit myself.'

385
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,173
Then quickly, Gretel came behind
and pushed with all her might...

386
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,093
plunging the wicked old woman
headlong into the flames...

387
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,303
banging the door shut
and bolting it tight.

388
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,514
"The witch howled."

389
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,933
That's enough.

390
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,143
"The witch howled like a scalded cat..."

391
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,480
but Gretel ran and left her there
to perish nonetheless.

392
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:50,358
She ran to her brother as fast as she could
and flung open the door.

393
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:54,320
'Hansel! Hansel!' she cried,
'We're saved! The witch is dead!"'

394
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,285
Time for sleep.

395
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,078
Say how they find their way back home.

396
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,830
Tomorrow night.

397
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,873
No. Tonight.

398
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,875
It's important.

399
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,840
Dylan, you know as well as I do.

400
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,384
They follow the trail of bread crumbs
back to their house.

401
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,721
And then their father covered them
with kisses and they were safe.

402
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,724
They were safe and they could sleep.
Now, come on.

403
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:30,064
- What is that?
- Rex.

404
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,776
Come on.

405
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:43,411
Rex keeps him down there.

406
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,912
Who?

407
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,332
The mean old man with the claws.

408
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,418
He wants to come up
while we sleep.

409
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,879
I keep my feet up here.

410
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,674
Rex keeps him down there.

411
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,261
He's my guard.

412
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,808
You should have a guard too.

413
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,898
Dylan, there's nothing down there.

414
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,107
Come here.

415
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,903
Look. See?

416
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,244
It's different when you're gone.

417
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,789
Come on.

418
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,677
On, please.

419
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,221
Okay, sweetie.

420
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:49,227
Night, night. Sleep tight.

421
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,479
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

422
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,650
Daddy coming home?

423
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,193
He's on his way.

424
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,737
He can follow the bread crumbs, right?

425
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,781
Right.

426
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:11,541
If the birds don't eat them first.

427
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:50,204
Ah, perfect, perfect, perfect.

428
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,898
Come on. Come on. Come on.

429
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,402
That's me in the corner

430
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:28,493
That's me in the spotlight

431
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,245
Light

432
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,581
Losin' my

433
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,834
Religion

434
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,485
Mommy's scared?

435
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,780
Dylan.

436
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:08,115
Mommy's fine.

437
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,826
It was just a bad dream.

438
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,828
What are you doing out of bed?

439
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,082
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.

440
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,709
Dylan, go back to sleep, honey.

441
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,087
I'm not sleepy.

442
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,977
Hello?

443
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,439
Police, ma'am. Can you open the door?

444
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,037
Heather Langenkamp?

445
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:57,039
Yes?

446
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,874
Is Chase Porter your husband?

447
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,336
Yes.

448
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,589
I'm afraid there was an accident.

449
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,800
It appears he fell asleep
while driving, ma'am.

450
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,179
Is he...? I mean...

451
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,181
Is he hurt?

452
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,101
I'm afraid it's worse than that, ma'am.

453
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,070
Is he dead?

454
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,323
Yes, ma'am.

455
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,705
Are you sure it's him?

456
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:41,042
We have his effects.
You can confirm from that.

457
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,503
I wanna see his body.

458
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,506
No, you don't, ma'am. It's not necessary.

459
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,886
I want to see it for myself.

460
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,520
Ahem. Excuse me.

461
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,981
- Can I help you?
- Porter.

462
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,650
Chase Porter.

463
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,200
It's back here.

464
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,292
You said Chase?

465
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,545
Mm-hm.

466
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:14,885
I'm sorry.

467
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:27,648
Just sign here at the bottom.
That's all we need.

468
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,026
I'd like to see once again.

469
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:32,903
I'm sorry?

470
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,573
Could you lift the sheet again, please?

471
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,003
More, please?

472
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,049
What is that?

473
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,051
It was a bad wreck, ma'am.

474
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:00,306
The head's gonna be all right
for the funeral and all, but...

475
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,146
Here, lady. You okay?

476
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,275
- You sure?
- Yes.

477
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:20,409
Oh, God. What did that?

478
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,703
Well, they said the truck was tore up
something awful.

479
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,372
So you can imagine him not being in...

480
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,583
well, exactly top shape.

481
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,503
It looks like...

482
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,129
he was clawed.

483
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,841
Yeah.

484
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,344
Well, that's why
we don't lift the sheet...

485
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,721
past the face, ma'am.

486
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:45,976
Sometimes it's what we don't see
that gets us through the night.

487
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,403
So, uh, if you'll just sign...

488
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,579
God is our hope and strength...

489
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,375
a very present help in trouble.

490
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:14,255
Therefore, we will not fear,
though the earth be moved...

491
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:19,093
and though the hills be carried
into the midst of the sea...

492
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,222
though the waters thereof
rage and swell...

493
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:29,061
and though the mountains shake
at the tempest of the same...

494
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,997
Look!

495
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:05,639
Julie, where's Dylan?

496
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,683
I don't know.

497
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:15,316
Help! Mommy!

498
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:17,902
Dylan!

499
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,531
- Mommy!
- Dylan!

500
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,658
Dylan! Grab Mommy's hand!

501
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,118
Grab it!

502
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,828
Oh, my God!

503
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,873
Hurry!

504
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,051
Stay with me.

505
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:43,886
Aah! No!

506
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,346
Stay with me, Heather.

507
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,931
No!

508
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:53,729
- Where's Dylan? Where's Dylan?
- He's all right. He's right here.

509
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,194
- Oh, what happened?
- It was an earthquake.

510
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,112
You got knocked off your feet.

511
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,823
You got a pretty good bump, actually.

512
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,035
May he rest in peace, children...

513
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,955
and may you all get home safely.

514
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,040
Amen.

515
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,934
If there's anything I can do, Heather.
Anything.

516
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,812
Thank you, Robert.

517
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,439
Sweetie?

518
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,778
Tina?

519
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,292
Dylan.

520
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:51,388
Tina?

521
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,683
Who are you?

522
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,157
Dylan.

523
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,408
Baby, wake up.

524
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,455
Dylan! Dylan! Dylan, honey.

525
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,166
Shh, shh, shh.

526
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,043
Come on.

527
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,337
Okay, sugar.
We're gonna go back to bed now.

528
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,714
No, Mommy, I can't sleep there.

529
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,675
Honey, you have to sleep.

530
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:34,848
One, two, Freddy's coming for you

531
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,519
Where did you hear that?
Did you hear that on that movie?

532
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:40,562
Did you answer the phone?

533
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,775
Dylan, where did you hear that song?

534
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,860
In my bed.

535
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,197
In your bed?

536
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,575
Under my covers. Kids singing.

537
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,787
And way down there, the man...

538
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,581
the mean man...

539
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,378
What is that man doing?

540
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,839
Trying to get up.

541
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,800
Trying to get up into our world.

542
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,721
Dylan.

543
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,584
Where is Daddy now?

544
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,633
Daddy's in heaven.

545
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,429
He's with God now.

546
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:01,852
Do you have to die to see God?

547
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,605
I don't think so.

548
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,860
I think you have to pray.

549
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,530
And reach out.

550
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,705
Why does God let there be bad things?

551
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,337
I honestly don't know, honey.

552
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,592
Please try to get some sleep.

553
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,312
Can you come with me in my dreams?

554
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,612
I think that only happens in the movies.

555
00:42:55,198 --> 00:43:01,078
But I'll always, always,
be right here when you get back.

556
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,539
And I'll make sure...

557
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:09,169
that nobody gets your toes.

558
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,596
I know his behavior is bizarre.

559
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,057
But he's usually so normal
and well adjusted, John.

560
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:08,895
I just can't believe it's him
and not something outside influencing him.

561
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,524
Or is that how denial works?

562
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:16,820
Whether it is denial,
I don't think that's the case here.

563
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:20,532
Look, if you're really worried about Dylan,
have a doctor check him out.

564
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,075
You'll see. Everything's fine.

565
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,912
You're not just saying that
to help a crazy friend cope, are you?

566
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,792
Everything about Dylan's behavior
is understandable...

567
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,920
for a kid who just lost his father.

568
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,299
How does a child process
a thing like that?

569
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,010
I don't know.

570
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,388
I've not been able to process it
very well myself.

571
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,224
And you're not crazy, by the way.

572
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,770
Seeing Freddy in that grave
feels pretty crazy, and then jumping in.

573
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,606
- You didn't jump in.
- That's my memory.

574
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,316
It seemed absolutely real.

575
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,277
Seemed, not was.

576
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,280
It's...

577
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,782
It's in my family, you know.

578
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,909
What is?

579
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,953
A very close relative
died in an institution.

580
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:12,167
Really? Well, if having a screwy family
made a person crazy...

581
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:15,962
the whole world would be
one big loony bin.

582
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:20,300
You have a crazed fan after you.

583
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:23,470
That's what's making you crazy,
and probably Dylan too.

584
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,014
- I never mentioned that to him.
- Kids know.

585
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:29,309
Kids know when something's
bugging a parent.

586
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,230
You have no idea who this is calling?

587
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:34,731
Freddy, for all I know.

588
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:35,941
Come on.

589
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,319
It's a man...

590
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:43,073
or a boy, with a deep, you know...

591
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,282
Freddy voice.

592
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,328
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised
you've got Freddy in your dreams?

593
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,205
Hell, Sonny Bono...

594
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:53,458
after a while began seeing
his stalker everywhere, even at Mass.

595
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,210
Really?

596
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,965
And how many times did Letterman
call the cops thinking that woman...

597
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,300
was down in the kitchen again?
- Yeah.

598
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:06,346
I mean, it gets under your skin if you...
If you let it.

599
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,270
You really think Dylan's okay?

600
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:16,523
Dylan's fine. You're fine.

601
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:20,152
You're hurting but you're fine,
and you're definitely not crazy.

602
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,447
My worst fear...

603
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,075
that whatever madness
is in my family I have.

604
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:40,172
That I've passed it on to Dylan.

605
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,724
Dylan!

606
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,064
- Heather!
- Dylan!

607
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,942
- Make sure he's okay, John!
- Yeah, are you all right?

608
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,694
- Are you okay, huh?
- Oh, my God.

609
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:06,740
- Are you sure? Does anything hurt?
- Dylan, are you all right? Honey?

610
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,867
Are you all right? Are you sure?

611
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,328
God wouldn't take me.

612
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,082
Oh, my God. Oh, honey.

613
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,667
It's unbelievable.

614
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,600
- Yeah.
- Robert.

615
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,812
- Heather, you doing all right?
- Hanging in there.

616
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,939
You know the guy that was
calling me all the time?

617
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:24,442
He started again.
And he's putting stuff in my mail again.

618
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,321
The SOB probably read about the funeral
in the papers or something.

619
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:33,326
Sick mother. It's the last thing
you need right now, I'm sure.

620
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:36,830
Actually, it's been giving me
Freddy nightmares.

621
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:39,374
Wait a second,
now let me get this straight.

622
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,002
You're having nightmares about Freddy?

623
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,211
As in me?

624
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:47,465
No, it isn't you. He's scarier.

625
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,177
He's...

626
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,556
Darker? More evil?

627
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,767
Yeah. How did you know?

628
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,811
Call it a guess.

629
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,023
Pretty damn good guess.

630
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,650
Anyway, what I was calling about was...

631
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,861
have you seen any of the script
by any chance?

632
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:13,241
No. Wes won't show it until he's finished.
At least that's what he told me.

633
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:14,868
Well, when is it gonna be done?

634
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:20,081
Well, the way he's writing, who knows?
He's so weird.

635
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:23,168
I asked him how far he was
at the funeral. What did he say?

636
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:27,464
Oh, yeah. "As far as Dylan
trying to reach God."

637
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:30,383
Whatever that means. Weird, huh?

638
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,178
Putting your kid in the script.

639
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,224
Robert, have you been
having nightmares?

640
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,064
Look, we need to talk,
but not over the phone.

641
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,399
Can I come over?

642
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:50,278
Um, actually, Heather, uh...

643
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,031
today's no good. There's, um...

644
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,743
There's something I have to finish.
Tomorrow maybe, huh?

645
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:00,246
Okay, tomorrow.
But early in the morning.

646
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:03,625
And meanwhile, Robert, take care, okay?

647
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:06,419
Yeah. Sure.

648
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:32,941
Damn it!

649
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:53,795
One, two, Freddy's coming for you

650
00:52:55,464 --> 00:53:00,635
Dylan?

651
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:07,225
Three, four, better lock your door

652
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,692
Five, six, grab your crucifix

653
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:23,283
Seven, eight, better stay up late

654
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,537
Dylan. Don't sing that song.

655
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:34,252
Nine, 10, never sleep again

656
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,506
Dylan!

657
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,049
Stop it!

658
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:41,926
No!

659
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,558
Never sleep again

660
00:53:49,059 --> 00:54:24,844
Never sleep again

661
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,012
Dylan.

662
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:31,643
Never sleep again

663
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,519
Never sleep ag...

664
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,151
- Yes.
Ha-ha-ha. I touched him.

665
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:12,058
Any history of epilepsy in your family?

666
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:13,309
No.

667
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,062
- Diabetes?
- No.

668
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,772
Was there a trigger event?

669
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,316
Trauma, shock?

670
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,736
You haven't shown him any of the films
you've made, have you?

671
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,738
The horror stuff?

672
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,116
His father just passed away.

673
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,284
I'm sorry.

674
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:32,578
But I'm convinced...

675
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:37,625
those films can tip an unstable child
over the edge.

676
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,585
Unstable?

677
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:43,089
Dylan's not unstable. He's just upset.

678
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,758
We'll run tests
and we'll know in a few days.

679
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:48,219
Does he have to stay here overnight?

680
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,263
Absolutely.

681
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,185
Dr. Degraffey, ER.

682
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,605
Anything more happen
we need to know about?

683
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,066
Well, like what?

684
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:06,654
Sometimes what a child says
or fantasizes...

685
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,948
will give a clue to what ails him.

686
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,702
Did he say anything
while he was still lucid?

687
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,877
No.

688
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,594
Dr. Einhorn, line 237.

689
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:31,679
What do we have here?

690
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:33,973
Too soon to know for sure.

691
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:37,060
The early symptoms point
to childhood schizophrenia.

692
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:44,317
Dylan, can you hear me?

693
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:48,321
Dylan, you have to fight it...

694
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:51,699
whatever it is that's after you,
and you gotta come back to me.

695
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:54,619
You can't make it alone. Do you hear?

696
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:01,751
If you can hear me, then you can tell me
what you need to feel safe.

697
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,468
Rex? Is that what you want?

698
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,807
Well... Well, Rex is at home...

699
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,476
and that's where you should be.

700
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,312
But you gotta get better
before they'll let you come home.

701
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,647
Do you understand?

702
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,150
Home.

703
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,028
Home. Home, that's right.

704
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,364
That's where I want you, sweetie.

705
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:34,283
And you know, we're not that far away.

706
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,411
Look. Look, right out there...

707
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,832
past the freeway is our home.

708
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,291
But to get there...

709
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,878
you have to come out
from where you are...

710
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,924
so that they'll let you
come home to Rex...

711
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,676
and to me.

712
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,637
Time for your medicine, cowboy.

713
00:57:57,558 --> 00:57:58,891
What is that?

714
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:00,977
Something to help him sleep.

715
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,645
Okay.

716
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:08,401
There you go. Yeah, it's good.

717
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,241
There you go.

718
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,786
One, two, good.

719
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,705
Good! Attaboy!

720
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:22,874
Come on, now lie down
and take a little nap.

721
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,668
You should get some rest too.
He's going to be fine.

722
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:29,380
We're gonna do some tests
and then you can come back later.

723
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,258
Will you get that other side, please?

724
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:34,677
I grabbed his things.

725
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,680
These are his favorite pajamas here.

726
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,099
Um...

727
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,476
Honey, I've gotta go.

728
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,770
I love you, Dylan.

729
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,148
Remember what I said.

730
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,776
We'll take care of everything.

731
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:58,618
Bye.

732
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,166
Wake up, lady!

733
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,004
Don't lose it now!

734
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,273
Seismologists at Caltech have counted...

735
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,233
over 300 of the tremblers so far.

736
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,527
Though most were too faint
for us to feel...

737
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:17,363
seven have shaken our community
in the last two weeks.

738
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:20,866
And now scientists are speculating
there might be an unknown fault...

739
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,202
running beneath Los Angeles.
A fault that could...

740
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,716
Hi. You've reached the Englund residence.

741
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,301
We're out of town right now.

742
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:43,639
You can leave a message if you wish,
but, uh, we'll be gone for some time.

743
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:11,167
I wish I could tell you where this
script was going. The fact is I don't know.

744
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:15,504
You know, I dream a scene at night.
I write it in the morning.

745
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,132
Beyond that, your guess is as good
as mine where it's going.

746
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,426
Well, at least tell me
what it's about so far.

747
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,597
- Coffee.
- Thanks.

748
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,932
I can tell you
what the nightmare's about so far.

749
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:31,103
It's about this entity,
whatever you want to call it.

750
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,939
It's old. It's very old.

751
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:37,777
It's existed in different forms
in different times.

752
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,488
The only thing that stays the same
is what it lives for.

753
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,531
What is that?

754
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,159
Well, the murder of innocence.

755
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:49,997
This is still a script
we're talking about, right, Wes?

756
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:54,835
Yeah, well, I sort of think of it
as a nightmare in progress.

757
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:58,756
Well, in this nightmare in progress then,
does this thing have any weaknesses?

758
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,925
Well, it can be captured sometimes.

759
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:03,260
Captured? How?

760
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,388
By storytellers, of all things.

761
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:10,726
I mean, every so often they imagine a story
good enough to sort of catch its essence...

762
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:14,397
and then for a while
it's held prisoner in the story.

763
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:18,567
- Like the genie in the bottle.
- Exactly. Exactly.

764
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,945
But the problem comes
when the story dies.

765
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:22,530
That can happen in a lot of ways.

766
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,490
It can get too familiar to people...

767
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,992
or somebody waters it down
to make it an easier sell.

768
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:31,664
You know, or maybe it's just so upsetting
to society that it's banned outright.

769
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,459
However it happens when the story dies,
the evil is set free.

770
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:40,631
You're saying
Freddy is this ancient thing?

771
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,634
Right. Current version.

772
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:46,512
And for 10 years,
he's been held captive pretty much...

773
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,141
as Freddy in the
Nightmare on Elm Street series...

774
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,560
but now that the films have ended...

775
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:54,520
the genie's out of the bottle, Heather.

776
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:58,482
That's what the nightmares are telling me
and that's what I'm writing.

777
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:01,277
Well, if Freddy is loose in your script...

778
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,320
where's he gonna go?

779
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:06,073
Another age? Another form?

780
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:09,201
No. That's not what the dreams
have him doing though.

781
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,704
What is he doing?

782
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,540
Well, see, he's sort of gotten
used to being Freddy now...

783
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:19,545
and he likes our time and space,
so he's decided to cross over.

784
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,881
Out of films, into our reality.

785
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,345
Isn't there somebody
who can stop him?

786
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,891
Actually, there is a person
in the dreams...

787
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,394
sort of a gatekeeper, so to speak.

788
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:40,357
Somebody that Freddy has to get by
before he can come through into our world.

789
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,110
That person's you, Heather.

790
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:46,071
- It's me?
- Yeah.

791
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,698
But why me?

792
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:50,409
Well, dramatically speaking,
it makes perfect sense.

793
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,077
You played Nancy, after all.

794
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,246
You were the first to humiliate him,
defeat him.

795
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:57,208
That was Nancy, Wes, it's not me.

796
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,211
Yeah, but it was you
that gave Nancy her strength...

797
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,422
so in order to get out
he's got to come through you.

798
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:07,676
And it's inevitable that he's gonna try
to do that at your most vulnerable points.

799
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:14,558
Oh, my God, Wes. Did you know?

800
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:17,436
Heather, it was a script.

801
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,940
It was a dream. I didn't know.

802
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,860
You know damn well
it's more than that now.

803
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:29,031
Wes.

804
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,533
How can we stop him?

805
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,538
I think the only way to stop him
is to make another movie.

806
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:39,917
I swear I'll stay by this computer
and write until I finish the script...

807
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:44,421
but when that time comes,
you're gonna have to make a choice.

808
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:47,591
Choice? What kind of choice?

809
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:50,886
Whether or not you're willing
to play Nancy one last time.

810
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:20,332
"Many of the symptoms
of childhood schizophrenia...

811
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:25,337
are duplicated in children
suffering from sleep deprivation."

812
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:35,014
"Sleep deprivation can produce
trance-like states...

813
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,682
mechanical behavior..."

814
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,726
I'm not sleepy.

815
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,644
Rex woke me up.

816
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:43,856
He was fighting the mean old man
with the claws.

817
01:05:44,024 --> 01:05:46,442
You have no idea who this is calling?

818
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,860
Freddy, for all I know.

819
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:49,153
As in me?

820
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:51,947
No, it isn't you. He's scarier.

821
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,700
- Darker? More evil?
- How did you know?

822
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,577
He's decided to cross over...

823
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:58,996
out of films, into our reality.

824
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:02,583
Never sleep again.

825
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:18,349
The world of horror films
suffered its own terror today...

826
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,727
as two of Hollywood's best-known
special-effects technicians...

827
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:24,313
were found dead in a vacant field.

828
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,690
Terrance Feinstein
and Charles Wilson...

829
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:30,736
two special-effects artists reputedly
working on a top-secret project...

830
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,280
for the makers of
the Freddy Krueger films...

831
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:36,992
were found brutally slashed to death
early this morning.

832
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:49,963
Freddy's glove was missing, and police are
speculating the murders were the result...

833
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:54,426
of a botched theft,
which apparently took place two days ago.

834
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:57,721
At this point the murder weapon
has not been found...

835
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:36,301
Oh, God.

836
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:01,910
Miss me?

837
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:29,980
Nancy.

838
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:53,295
Ow!

839
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,175
Oh, Dylan. Dylan!

840
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:01,303
- There are no visiting hours.
- You must understand.

841
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:04,765
No, I don't understand. I'm his babysitter.

842
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:08,936
I'm a close friend of the family, damn it.
I just need to see him for a minute.

843
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,647
- Sixty seconds. Come on.
- You have to understand...

844
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,233
I can't let you see him.
- Julie?

845
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,944
- Heather.
- What are you doing here?

846
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:20,739
I don't know.

847
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,784
I had this terrible dream about Dylan.

848
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,245
I had to come and see him.

849
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,039
You must think I'm crazy.

850
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:33,210
No, I don't. Is he all right?

851
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:35,212
I don't know, they wouldn't let me in.

852
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,757
Miss Langenkamp, I'm afraid
there are no evening visiting hours...

853
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:40,759
in intensive care.
- Is he all right?

854
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,220
Dylan? He's holding well.

855
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:45,389
Earlier, he had some problems.

856
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:47,391
He's in an oxygen tent just now.

857
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:48,809
Oh, my God.

858
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:50,769
Heather.

859
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:54,106
Seems we've had an accident,
Miss Langenkamp.

860
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:55,732
May I?

861
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:00,904
Those are nasty cuts.
How did you get them?

862
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,699
It happened in the earthquake.

863
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:05,450
I fell.

864
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,035
I need to see Dylan.

865
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:11,123
Wait a moment.
First, let's see about you.

866
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:18,463
If these had been
a few inches nearer the wrist...

867
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,300
What did you say you cut yourself on?

868
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,844
It was the earthquake, it was dark,
I have no idea.

869
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,722
But these look quite fresh.

870
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:30,225
They are.
It happened in tonight's earthquake.

871
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:34,438
It happened just 15 minutes ago.

872
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:35,856
You must have felt it.

873
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,611
Guess we lucked out over here.

874
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:48,452
Your son is apparently
terrified of a man...

875
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:51,914
someone he thinks is going
to come out of his bed.

876
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:55,500
One of the nurses heard him
talking to himself.

877
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,837
Do you have any idea
who that man is, Miss Langenkamp?

878
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:02,341
I forgot to bring his dinosaur, Rex.

879
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,928
He keeps Freddy
from coming up out of his...

880
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:08,639
bed.

881
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,350
The man from your films?

882
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:15,395
Freddy Krueger? With the claws?

883
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,565
Is that who he's afraid of?

884
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:27,449
You have let your child
see your films, haven't you?

885
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,035
Every kid knows who Freddy is.

886
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:33,872
He's like Santa Claus or King Kong or...

887
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:37,876
Yes. Well...

888
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,671
interesting talking with you,
Miss Langenkamp.

889
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,465
I hope you understand.

890
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:46,593
My concerns are simply
for the welfare of your son.

891
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,075
How's he doing?

892
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:53,618
Dylan!

893
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:58,415
Honey! You shouldn't do that.

894
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,292
Too late.

895
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:05,130
I'm almost there, Heather.

896
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,799
Almost there!

897
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:14,890
Daddy!

898
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,308
Dylan!

899
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:17,684
- Help!
- Daddy!

900
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:25,776
Doctor!

901
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,027
Keep her right there!

902
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:29,071
We can't hold him much longer, doctor.

903
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,240
- Full anesthetic. Stat!
- We don't have that here, doctor.

904
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:36,244
No anesthetic, you say.
Screw it then, I'm going in.

905
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,663
Little booger's full of something
I don't like.

906
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,582
Let's get him open.

907
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,417
Cut this evil out of him.

908
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:44,795
Ha!

909
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,004
No!

910
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:49,341
- Gloria!
- He's got my baby?

911
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:50,550
- Who?
- Freddy!

912
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:52,636
Freddy? Who?
Freddy Krueger or something?

913
01:13:52,804 --> 01:13:54,179
What the hell is going on?

914
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:57,057
My baby, Freddy's got my baby.
He's got my Dylan.

915
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:59,267
Miss Langenkamp. Miss Langenkamp.

916
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,270
I suggest you go home
and get some rest.

917
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,897
Your son is fine.

918
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:06,358
He's been taken downstairs
for further testing.

919
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:07,734
But he was just here.

920
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:11,822
He was here.
You fell asleep. We took him.

921
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,740
You looked so exhausted.

922
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,784
Frankly, we didn't want to wake you.

923
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:18,787
Besides, the young woman
Julie is with him.

924
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,956
That's his babysitter, right?

925
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:23,875
Believe me, everything is fine.

926
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,921
Everything's not fine.

927
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,924
Damn. Call security.

928
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,390
Security, code yellow to Pediatric Testing.

929
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:41,434
Security, code yellow to Pediatric Testing.

930
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,606
Uh, this is a restricted area.

931
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:48,567
- Do you have a pass?
- Screw your pass!

932
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,527
It's all right. Miss Langenkamp.

933
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:53,321
- Where is he?
- Just stay calm.

934
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,282
Tell us how our little boy is doing.

935
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:58,910
He's fine, actually. Uh, he just came
around about 10 minutes ago.

936
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,539
Uh, he seems to be suffering
from acute sleep deprivation.

937
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,666
I don't think she lets him get sleep.

938
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,252
What are you saying? Where is he?

939
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,962
Heather.

940
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:13,091
I've got someone here
who wants to see you.

941
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,177
Julie.

942
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,347
Dylan!

943
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:26,897
Oh, honey. Oh, Dylan.
Are you okay, champ?

944
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:31,443
Can we go get Rex now?
The bad man's getting awful close.

945
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,112
I know he is.

946
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,115
We're gonna go get Rex right now.

947
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,242
I'm afraid Dylan should stay here...

948
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,537
until we know what's causing
these episodes, Miss Langenkamp.

949
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:46,750
I'm sure you understand.

950
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:50,921
Good.

951
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:57,344
Look, I'll tell you what.

952
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,763
I'm gonna go home
and get Rex for you right now.

953
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:02,098
You know that home
isn't far from here, right?

954
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,976
- Right across the freeway.
- That's right.

955
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:09,105
So I won't be gone long. And Julie,
she's gonna stay right here with you.

956
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:11,524
Yeah. You bet.

957
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,654
Hurry up, please. I'm sleepy.

958
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:21,326
I promise. Cross my heart.

959
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:25,413
But, Dylan, until Mommy gets back...

960
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:29,668
whatever you do, don't fall asleep.

961
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:33,880
Julie, don't let him out of your sight.

962
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:38,635
What's going on here?
Your hair's turning gray.

963
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,430
Julie, keep him awake!

964
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:45,225
Understand?

965
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:52,691
Excuse me, miss,
would you come with us for a second?

966
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,651
What? Hey!

967
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:57,696
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get your hands off me.

968
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,993
Do you mind? What the hell is this?

969
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:07,038
Just a quick word, Miss Langenkamp,
for Dylan's sake.

970
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:16,089
Well, we've had an exciting day,
haven't we, Miss Langenkamp?

971
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:29,269
- One, two, three. One, two, three.
- You won.

972
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,408
Would you mind stepping outside
for just one moment, miss?

973
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:46,745
As a matter of fact, I would.
What are you doing?

974
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,914
It's just a little shot
to see that he gets some sleep.

975
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,958
No. His mother specifically said...

976
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,961
- I said no.
- Do it.

977
01:17:57,256 --> 01:18:00,216
- Ow!
- All done.

978
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:02,802
He'll be asleep in no time.

979
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:05,638
- Would you mind letting go of my arm?
- You bitch!

980
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:10,310
Hey! You can't do that!

981
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:18,985
Well, I know what's in that one.
Do you have any idea what's in this one?

982
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:21,738
Or what's gonna happen to you
when I stick you with it?

983
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,490
And I will.

984
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:25,492
Aah!

985
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:32,957
Oh, no. No, no, no, Dylan.
I want you to stay awake, okay?

986
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:36,044
I want you to keep your eyes open for me,
okay? Come on.

987
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,671
Miss Langenkamp...

988
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,968
has there been any use
of recreational drugs in your family?

989
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:47,263
- What?
- Or any history of mental disturbance?

990
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:52,143
- What are you asking?
- Please, don't take it wrong.

991
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:55,313
If there was, there's a good chance...

992
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:58,233
Dylan could be suffering
from something passed down to him.

993
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:04,155
Have you been suffering from any
delusional events, Miss Langenkamp?

994
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:06,366
Mm-mm.

995
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,122
This man from your films...

996
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,874
Freddy Krueger...

997
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,169
Have you been seeing him?

998
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:19,712
No.

999
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,595
- Hello!
- Would you get those keys?

1000
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,557
Dylan, I want you to stay awake.
Come on, stay awake.

1001
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:33,893
- Keep your eyes open for me, okay?
- Where's Mommy?

1002
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,603
She'll be back. Now, stay awake.

1003
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:41,109
There are drugs and treatments,
Miss Langenkamp.

1004
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:46,489
We could put Dylan in foster care
for a short while...

1005
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:49,409
just long enough
to run some tests on you.

1006
01:19:49,577 --> 01:19:52,036
Just keep your eyes open.
Do that for me, okay?

1007
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:55,081
Come on. Stay awake.
Stay awake for me, Dylan.

1008
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:59,419
I want you to stay awake, okay?
Stay awake. Keep your eyes open.

1009
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:04,632
Dylan, what's the matter?

1010
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:09,929
Julie, behind you.

1011
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:18,354
There's nothing there.

1012
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,690
Dylan, what's wrong?

1013
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:24,152
Dylan, stop it. You're scaring me.

1014
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,363
Dylan?

1015
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,868
I want my son out of here, right now!

1016
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,078
Very well.

1017
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,706
As soon as we can gather
the appropriate papers.

1018
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:39,584
You don't understand!
If Dylan falls asleep...

1019
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,880
I got it.

1020
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:56,100
Oh, no!

1021
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:57,310
Dylan, get out of here!

1022
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:59,187
Get... Dylan!

1023
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:13,034
Hey, Dylan, ever play skin the cat?

1024
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:15,203
Aah! No! No!

1025
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:27,090
Come on.

1026
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:39,394
Help me.

1027
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,354
Julie!

1028
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:52,282
Rex!

1029
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,325
What the hell's going on?

1030
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:58,705
No, miss, you can't go in there.
No, get back.

1031
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,207
No, wait, wait. You can't...

1032
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,797
Code yellow to Pediatric Testing.

1033
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:10,758
Code yellow to Pediatric Testing.

1034
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,677
Julie.

1035
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:19,225
Where's my son? Where is he?

1036
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:21,853
Have you seen my son?

1037
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:25,356
- He was just here. He was just...
- The boy?

1038
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,984
No way he's going anywhere.
He's been heavily sedated.

1039
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:29,944
He doesn't have to be awake
to be on his feet.

1040
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:32,196
- What?
- He sleepwalks, you idiot!

1041
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:36,451
He's fully capable of walking
out of this hospital! Oh, shit!

1042
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:50,590
- Hello?
- John, It's Heather. I need your help!

1043
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,719
- Why? What happened?
- John, Dylan's run away from the hospital.

1044
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:57,472
I don't know if he's wandering around
or headed for the house...

1045
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,767
but I think Freddy's after him!
I know that sounds so crazy, but...

1046
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,685
You're right. That sounds crazy.

1047
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:06,147
Oh, my God.

1048
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:17,408
Dylan!

1049
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,702
You know that home isn't far from here.

1050
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:20,953
No! Dylan!

1051
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:23,331
Right across the freeway.

1052
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,553
Dylan!

1053
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,062
Dylan!

1054
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,749
Krueger, you bastard!

1055
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:09,669
Take me!

1056
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,314
Dylan!

1057
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:45,580
- Are you okay?
- Hey, man, is she okay?

1058
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,213
My son is out here!

1059
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,843
Dylan! Dylan! Leave me alone! Dylan!

1060
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,097
Dylan!

1061
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,329
Dylan!

1062
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,467
- Dylan? Aah!
- Oh, I'm sorry!

1063
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:41,385
What happened to you?
Are you all right?

1064
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,721
I'm fine. Have you seen Dylan?
Where is he?

1065
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:48,726
Take it easy. Take it easy. Relax.
He's right there. What happened?

1066
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:52,271
Oh, Dylan! Oh, God! You're here.

1067
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:56,192
- What's going on, Heather?
- What in the world happened?

1068
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:59,904
- I know how Chase really died.
- What do you mean?

1069
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:02,532
Fred Krueger did it.

1070
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:07,495
Yeah, sure.

1071
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,756
You saw him, didn't you?

1072
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:21,384
Coming for you

1073
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:23,511
Nancy, let's go outside.

1074
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,054
- Dylan.
- He'll be all right.

1075
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,266
I'll be right back.

1076
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,291
What the hell is going on, Nancy?

1077
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:56,961
Why are you calling me Nancy, John?

1078
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:59,463
Why are you calling me John?

1079
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:09,223
Nancy, pull yourself together
before you make yourself and that kid nuts.

1080
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:17,273
John!

1081
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:20,151
- Would you call Robert?
- Robert?

1082
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:21,402
Robert Englund.

1083
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,780
You know, the guy who plays Freddy.

1084
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:26,824
- Freddy who?
- Freddy Krueger!

1085
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:31,579
Nancy, Freddy's dead.

1086
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:40,379
Now, don't start losing it
like your mother did.

1087
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,007
I love you, sweetheart.

1088
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:47,011
Don't forget that.

1089
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:58,606
I love you too, Daddy.

1090
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:30,262
Now, get yourself some rest, Nancy.
Please.

1091
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:02,545
Dylan?

1092
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:09,719
One, two, Freddy's coming for you

1093
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:13,305
Dylan!

1094
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:20,146
Almost there!

1095
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:24,608
Listen, Daddy,
I've got a proposition for you.

1096
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,902
I'm gonna go and get the guy who did it.

1097
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:29,780
And I want you to be there
to arrest him when I bring him out, okay?

1098
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:33,492
- Nancy, just tell me who did it.
- I'll go get him, baby.

1099
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,286
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy.

1100
01:29:35,746 --> 01:29:36,787
Yeah, sure.

1101
01:30:10,697 --> 01:30:12,990
Dylan's sleeping pills?

1102
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,785
Say how they find their way back home.

1103
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:18,120
It's important.

1104
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:22,625
Bread crumbs. Dylan.

1105
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:26,921
Too late, Heather.

1106
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,633
Too late.

1107
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:43,687
Dylan.

1108
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:31,068
Join you.

1109
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:35,823
You've given me a way to join you.

1110
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:56,051
Yes!

1111
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:26,957
Mommy!

1112
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,273
Aah!

1113
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,316
Mommy!

1114
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:46,287
Dylan!

1115
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:13,063
Mommy!

1116
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:17,609
Almost there.

1117
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:00,569
"The more she read..."

1118
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:03,280
the more she realized
what she had in her hands...

1119
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:07,826
was nothing more or less
than her life itself.

1120
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:10,662
That everything
she had experienced and thought...

1121
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:12,915
"...was bound within these pages."

1122
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,379
"There was no movie."

1123
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,255
There was only...

1124
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:21,465
"...her life."

1125
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:23,133
Aah!

1126
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:24,885
- It's just me.
- Dylan!

1127
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:32,059
- Are you okay? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1128
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:35,229
- Okay. Where's the man?
- I don't know.

1129
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:37,898
He had me, but then he let me go.

1130
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:42,945
Meet your maker.

1131
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,125
Pick a pet for the rug rat, bitch.

1132
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:09,304
Fuck you!

1133
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,768
- Mommy!
- Get out of here, Dylan!

1134
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:37,708
Take this!

1135
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:53,098
Come here, my pretty.
I've got some gingerbread for you!

1136
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,934
No! Dylan, run!

1137
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:13,577
Mommy!

1138
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:15,996
Gotcha! Ha!

1139
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:22,711
Mommy?

1140
01:37:23,505 --> 01:37:27,090
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

1141
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:32,262
Now, where's your mommy,
piglet, huh? Huh?

1142
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:37,059
One, two, Freddy's coming for you

1143
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:33,574
Dylan?

1144
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:35,367
Mommy!

1145
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:48,880
Dylan!

1146
01:38:59,851 --> 01:39:02,436
Mommy!

1147
01:39:14,073 --> 01:39:15,574
Come to Papa!

1148
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:22,122
Gonna eat you up.

1149
01:39:39,849 --> 01:39:41,725
No!

1150
01:40:04,499 --> 01:40:06,166
Dylan! Get out of there!

1151
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:08,293
- Hey!
- Aah!

1152
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:37,864
No!

1153
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,590
Push him in!

1154
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:05,767
Push!

1155
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:33,670
Run!

1156
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:08,955
Are you okay?

1157
01:42:13,211 --> 01:42:16,546
Oh, my... Honey. Honey.

1158
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:20,884
Oh, my God.

1159
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:24,137
We're saved. The witch is dead.

1160
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:28,016
And his mother covered him with kisses,
and they were safe.

1161
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:44,074
Heather, thanks for having the guts
to play Nancy one last time.

1162
01:42:44,242 --> 01:42:46,743
At last Freddy's back where he belongs.

1163
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:48,954
Regards, Wes.

1164
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:07,264
Is it a story?

1165
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:09,933
Yeah. It's a story.

1166
01:43:10,434 --> 01:43:12,519
Read me some.

1167
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:17,732
"We open on an old wooden bench."

1168
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:22,696
There's fire and tools
and a man's grimy hands...

1169
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:27,534
building what soon is revealed
as a gleaming set of claws.

1170
01:43:27,702 --> 01:43:30,078
And the claws are moving now...

1171
01:43:30,246 --> 01:43:35,125
as if awakening
from a long and unwanted sleep.

1172
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:39,296
Then the man lays one trembling hand
flat upon the table...

1173
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:43,508
and with his other,
picks up a thick, sharp blade.

1174
01:43:43,676 --> 01:43:48,263
Behind the lights,
faces watch from the darkness...

1175
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:53,268
"...ready to laugh or scream in terror."
