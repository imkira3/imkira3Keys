00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:31,583
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:35,489
We are now on final approach
to our destination port of Saint Lowel,

4
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:37,424
the largest city on Mars.

5
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:39,428
We hope you had a pleasant flight.

6
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:43,091
Today's temperature
is a cool 11 degrees Celsius.

7
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,567
The oxygen percentage reading
is seven percent.

8
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:49,434
Reports have come in
of slight unrest throughout the city...

9
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:51,440
due to public demonstrations.

10
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:54,272
We hope you have an enjoyable time
during your stay on Mars.

11
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,471
Thank you.

12
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:14,724
No! Jennifer!

13
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:54,060
Please remain seated
and keep your seat belts fastened...

14
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:56,128
until we've come to a full stop.

15
00:01:56,206 --> 00:01:58,697
We wish to thank our passengers
for their patronage.

16
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:02,575
We look forward to servicing you
in the future. Have a nice day.

17
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:46,252
The cargo area?

18
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:00,862
Make sure your units
are covering the rooftop and the rear.

19
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:32,160
All in a day's work, Lieutenant.

20
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:34,662
And don't try and bill me for that bike.

21
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:01,353
Hey, watch out.

22
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,190
Freeze!
Get your hands up!

23
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,830
I said, "Get your hands up!" Now!

24
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:22,910
- What's up?
- Detective, you'd better stay back.

25
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,913
Handle it.

26
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,749
Get back!

27
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:44,956
Tell me you're packin' your gun, Sheriff.

28
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:47,127
How about you?

29
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:50,639
A bunch of cowboys up the ass,
and not one of them's got a gun.

30
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,874
Stop now!

31
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,321
Let me down!
Let me down!

32
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:09,916
- Look! That bastard's getting away!
- What the hell?

33
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,162
- No!
- Stay out of this, Detective.

34
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:26,808
This is the Martian Police Department,
Detective Sylibus.

35
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:29,470
Did you have a nice trip?

36
00:06:41,424 --> 00:06:45,326
No!

37
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:47,488
It's McCanon!

38
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:49,498
He killed her!

39
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:57,132
The country singer?

40
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:12,152
Ha-ha!

41
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:32,966
Damn it!

42
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,908
Hey, wait! What the hell
are you doing? You damn lunatic!

43
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:48,156
This is insane.

44
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:58,893
Where did you go?
I was so worried about you?

45
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:12,745
Her name was Kelly McCanon.

46
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:17,013
She was a famous country singer. In fact,
the only country singer in the universe.

47
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:19,020
I guess this means they're extinct.

48
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:21,215
- And the suspect?
- I dunno.

49
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,224
Tell me, is that crazy getup
you're wearing...

50
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:25,726
a standard issue Martian police uniform?

51
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:27,729
'Course not.

52
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:31,324
- So, what's your name?
- The name's Armitage.

53
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:34,734
What a sexy back.

54
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,398
- I love broad shoulders.
- Hey!

55
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:40,874
What was that for?
I was just being nice!

56
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:43,377
Listen. What's going on here?

57
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:46,938
Is this somebody's idea of a sick joke?
Annie Oakley here isn't even human.

58
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,453
It's a damn robot.

59
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,460
What's wrong?

60
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,631
What's going on?

61
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,635
Spaceport police.
This is their jurisdiction.

62
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,512
In response to the Kelly McCanon incident,

63
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,344
the Martian Police Department
has created T.C.S.,

64
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,180
Technological Criminal SWAT,
to investigate.

65
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:26,449
Lieutenant Randolph of the M.P.D.
declined further details.

66
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:32,927
The million-dollar question is:

67
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:36,089
Just what do we have here,
a woman or a robot?

68
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:39,225
Sir, results from
my preliminary findings...

69
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:42,294
are, well, very interesting.

70
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:45,272
I learned that the, victim...
shall we call her...

71
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:48,208
is not a human nor a cyborg.

72
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:50,939
After examining the body,
I concluded she was entirely a robot.

73
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:54,380
Her body tissue was
of man-made organic origin,

74
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,509
and she functioned through
artificial intelligence.

75
00:09:56,586 --> 00:10:00,022
While no one is capable of
creating a human brain... yet,

76
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:02,819
her computer brain was very sophisticated.

77
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:07,727
And, as I mentioned, her physical
construction was created organically,

78
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:12,131
but it was done using a technology much more
advanced than the Second series models.

79
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:16,262
I believe that the victim was a
prototype built outside of regulations.

80
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:19,274
It could also,

81
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:21,970
mean that there are other
illegal models like her...

82
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:24,342
running around under our noses.

83
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:26,347
Yes, thank you.

84
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:29,851
And now Detective Sylibus
will give his report about the scene.

85
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:35,015
I... I am Ross Sylibus from
the Chicago Police Department.

86
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:44,165
The suspects appeared...

87
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:47,532
I mean, they seemed like they
wanted to transport the body...

88
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:49,696
without anyone noticing.

89
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:52,866
Probably to finish
their work somewhere else in private.

90
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:55,740
Officer Armitage there had been
trailing the suspects...

91
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:57,746
and then all hell broke loose.

92
00:10:57,814 --> 00:11:00,044
Armitage, can you fill us in?

93
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:03,051
Well, I trailed the suspects...

94
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,053
and saw they were equipped.

95
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:07,749
I didn't think
they were carrying a dead robot.

96
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:09,758
So, what the hell does that mean?

97
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:12,556
That it was McCanon's impostor
riding the shuttle?

98
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,562
Shut up, Eddie!

99
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,224
What did her manager have to say?

100
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,133
Well, sir, according to him,
he didn't see any difference...

101
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:23,730
between the woman he sat with
and the real country-western singer.

102
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:26,969
And nobody saw her come out
of the arriving terminal.

103
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:31,707
The only suspicious passenger
he saw was Detective Sylibus.

104
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:35,273
It seems that the trick for us is
to find out where the real McCanon is.

105
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:38,115
You know, maybe she's
feeling her wild oats.

106
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:41,486
Might've found herself
some kind of wild lover.

107
00:11:41,557 --> 00:11:43,491
Christ, Eddie, will you zip it?

108
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,494
- Just how was she acting inside the shuttle?
- She acted fine.

109
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:49,030
She was holding a normal conversation.

110
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:51,464
Nothing seemed unusual about it to me.

111
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:54,765
Hell, I wouldn't have been
able to tell her apart from a human.

112
00:11:57,506 --> 00:12:01,636
Are you telling us
that this robot was really McCanon?

113
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:05,545
You think that prima donna was
a machine from the beginning?

114
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:10,052
No. I'm saying you can't
distinguish it from a human being.

115
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,280
Hey, yeah, Armitage.

116
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:16,621
When you realized the corpse was
a robot, you seemed shocked, even upset.

117
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:18,626
Did you think something was wrong?

118
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:20,889
Well, did ya?

119
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:22,897
No, sir.

120
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,874
I hope you like your new place.

121
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:36,605
It's probably not as nice as you're used
to, but there's a housing shortage here.

122
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,307
Besides, the rent is reasonable
on this end of town.

123
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:42,351
Gee, a regular Park Avenue.

124
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:51,326
Whoa!

125
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:58,966
Twelfth floor.

126
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:01,526
I'm sure it's better when you get inside.

127
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:09,110
It smells stale.

128
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:11,373
Hey, is that all your luggage?

129
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:15,144
Well, you know, with all the excitement
at the baggage claim today...

130
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:17,378
just as well.

131
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:20,081
Probably stuff I wouldn't
have needed anyway.

132
00:13:20,156 --> 00:13:23,216
There's enough trash
from Earth here already.

133
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:25,692
Well, you do have a point about that.

134
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:28,696
Look at this.

135
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:34,793
This is a tape sent by the suspect...

136
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,896
of yesterday's Saint Lowel
spaceport shooting.

137
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:43,708
Here where we belong

138
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:47,180
What is this, some kind
of memorial program?

139
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:52,118
Where we belong

140
00:13:57,126 --> 00:14:00,186
The following scenes
contain graphic content...

141
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:02,253
and viewer discretion is advised.

142
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:06,461
If you have children,
please set your monitor to "L."

143
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:08,765
Hey, that's the guy.

144
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:16,008
I'll go take care of the baggage, babe.

145
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:18,012
All right.
Hurry back.

146
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:22,817
Who are you?

147
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:33,727
What are you doing?
Leave me alone.

148
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,305
Somebody help me, please.

149
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:52,443
No, don't.

150
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:55,416
How did you know I was a...

151
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:58,942
My God.

152
00:15:03,426 --> 00:15:05,360
Jessica.

153
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:32,880
This has been unedited material
from video files...

154
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:35,116
as sent to us by the murder suspect.

155
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:39,025
Here to comment on the footage
is Ms. Julia Blanchen,

156
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:42,064
an activist in the movement
to drive out robots.

157
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,187
It's amazing.

158
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:42,918
They're everywhere you look. You think
they could build something else.

159
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,517
You're here pretty early, Detective.

160
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,864
She's gone already,

161
00:16:56,939 --> 00:17:00,397
the badge-toting terror
in hot pants.

162
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:05,409
Hey, you want some free advice?

163
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:09,110
Try not to get your partner killed
this time. And here's one more thing.

164
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:13,087
When she puts on her visor...
Whoo, watch out.

165
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:15,555
And before I forget, here.

166
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:18,957
She's clean, gassed and waitin' downstairs.

167
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:21,792
And welcome to your new home.

168
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:37,077
Robots, get out!

169
00:17:37,146 --> 00:17:40,980
Get out right now!

170
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:49,317
- Give us back our jobs!
- Give us back our jobs!

171
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:55,186
I'm sorry to have to break you in so soon,

172
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:58,097
so we may as well get started.

173
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:02,331
But, Lieutenant, is our
section supposed to handle this matter?

174
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:05,305
Just what do you mean by that, Ross?

175
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:07,740
Well, you see, the victim
was definitely a robot,

176
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,335
so I don't see why M.P.D.
should get stuck dealing with it.

177
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:13,347
Shouldn't we let some other government
agency take it off our hands?

178
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:16,179
I wish it was that easy,
but it's the robot's origins...

179
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:18,186
that we're interested in finding out about.

180
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:22,213
As you may not be aware, people here
consider illegal robot technology...

181
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,555
and replication to be a criminal offense.

182
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:26,618
Yes, sir.
I guess so.

183
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:31,598
Are you going to tell me
why you wanted to transfer to Mars?

184
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,431
Well, I'd rather not, sir.

185
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:36,869
As you like, but let me warn you.

186
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:40,238
If you have
misguided compassion for robots,

187
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,243
you won't make it here.

188
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:53,043
Robots, get out!

189
00:18:53,122 --> 00:18:57,252
Get out right now!

190
00:18:57,326 --> 00:19:00,489
Do you hear us?
We want our jobs.

191
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:12,965
Wow, what a place.

192
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,602
- Excuse me, miss.
- Why not?

193
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:17,942
I'm very sorry,
but I've explained to you...

194
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:19,947
that I cannot allow you to see him.

195
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:23,178
You're telling me he doesn't remember
the name "Armitage" at all?

196
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:27,211
- Mr. Asakura said he's never heard of you.
- Listen!

197
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:29,189
Don't mess with me!

198
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:32,523
You'd better get out of here,
or I'll call the security gadget.

199
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:37,059
Yeah, I guess it's useless
talking to a Second like you.

200
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,066
Hey!

201
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:41,728
- Whoa!
- Just cancel that appointment.

202
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:45,433
Robots, get out!
Robots, get out now! Robots, get out!

203
00:19:45,507 --> 00:19:47,873
Robots, get out now!

204
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:50,605
I can't believe this.
Put me down right now!

205
00:19:56,618 --> 00:20:00,213
What the hell were you
trying to accomplish back there?

206
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:02,382
Robots, get out now!

207
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:06,724
You know, you really should
move your car. It might get trashed.

208
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:08,820
By those idiots.

209
00:20:08,897 --> 00:20:11,422
So, now what's next?

210
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,231
Well, immigration
seems like a likely place.

211
00:20:15,304 --> 00:20:19,172
Ross. I already went there
and couldn't find our guy on the list.

212
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,804
I doubt we'll find any record of him,

213
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,906
because 37 percent of the population
isn't registered here.

214
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,918
Or I guess you didn't know that.

215
00:20:30,986 --> 00:20:34,581
So who the hell were you trying to see
at the Conception Company?

216
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:37,925
That is private.

217
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:40,860
By the way, I've already done some legwork.

218
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:43,898
Conception was the company
that set the standards for the Seconds.

219
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:47,094
So, there you go.
But, you know, I still pity 'em.

220
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:50,409
The other manufacturer, Hugite, passed
them up, and it killed their aspirations,

221
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,039
but that's the way it always goes.

222
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:56,009
Say, does this fancy machine
have reclining seats?

223
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:57,978
Partner?

224
00:20:58,046 --> 00:21:01,447
If you're looking for a partner,

225
00:21:01,517 --> 00:21:03,451
then stop flying solo.

226
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,555
Hey, Ross, as your partner,
can I make a suggestion?

227
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:12,887
Yeah.

228
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:17,364
- Let's eat. I'm starving.
- All right.

229
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:08,048
- Ice cream.
- Junk food.

230
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:11,051
I thought we were
gonna get something to eat.

231
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,053
Well, whatever.

232
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,892
This is some kind of town.

233
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,088
Things are just gonna get worse
with all these remodeled Seconds.

234
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:24,326
There's no way humans and robots
are ever gonna get along.

235
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,924
Besides, you can't trust robots.

236
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:30,267
You're no different.

237
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:32,273
You and that guy are both the same.

238
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:34,866
What do you mean, that nutcase?

239
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:38,709
It just seems that both of you
have something against robots.

240
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,943
Well, I'm sick of all these cyborgs
and humanoids and machines...

241
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:44,577
that only seem to copy us.

242
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:46,053
Since I'm allowed to make a choice,

243
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:48,374
I choose not to like something
that pretends to be human.

244
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:10,102
Now, you're positive that
that woman on the shuttle with you...

245
00:23:10,178 --> 00:23:13,011
was Kelly McCanon?

246
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:15,447
- Well?
- Of course I'm sure.

247
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:17,610
Excuse me?

248
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:21,213
Please tell me
you've found Kelly, won't you,

249
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,124
No stinkin' robot can play a guitar
and sing the way Kelly does.

250
00:23:25,193 --> 00:23:28,026
I'm her manager.
I know her better than anybody.

251
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,360
She's the most human woman I know.

252
00:23:30,432 --> 00:23:33,492
Armitage!

253
00:23:35,537 --> 00:23:37,471
Your client is history, buddy.

254
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:40,372
Just learn to live with it.

255
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:42,376
Hey, wait!

256
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,614
Hey, wait up!
Armitage!

257
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:49,173
I want to go.

258
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:51,185
Your conduct was hardly professional.

259
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:54,518
Sorry, but that whiner
was nothing but an asshole.

260
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,854
You can sympathize with him, but I don't.

261
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:02,122
That jerk can't figure out how a robot...

262
00:24:02,197 --> 00:24:06,224
could possibly be as good
as his precious human star.

263
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:09,634
Don't you understand?

264
00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:13,664
All of McCanon's talents, personality
and dreams were inside that machine.

265
00:24:13,742 --> 00:24:16,643
My God.

266
00:24:16,712 --> 00:24:18,646
Yeah, what is it?

267
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:24,518
I didn't realize.

268
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:31,358
Sylibus here.

269
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:35,055
It's Chris. I'm receiving
a weird voice mail transmission.

270
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,257
Is Armitage with you?

271
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:40,631
No, I'm afraid I don't see her right now.

272
00:24:40,702 --> 00:24:45,264
It's coming to us in real time,
so I'll transmit it to your mailbox.

273
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,604
Log it and show it to Armitage right away.

274
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:50,167
I told you, an officer named Armitage.

275
00:24:50,245 --> 00:24:53,214
Okay, okay, lady.
We're looking for her right now.

276
00:24:53,281 --> 00:24:56,739
Please, you've got to help me.
I'm a Third!

277
00:24:56,818 --> 00:24:59,218
What's your name again?
Wait. Let me get a pen.

278
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:03,018
- All right, go ahead.
- Manning. It's Jessica Manning.

279
00:25:03,091 --> 00:25:06,185
I'm keeping a list
of all the Thirds from Pluto.

280
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:09,128
I can't go outside because of the protests,

281
00:25:09,197 --> 00:25:12,598
and the man on TV who killed
that singer has been sending me mail!

282
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:15,068
Something's gonna happen
unless you help me!

283
00:25:30,852 --> 00:25:32,786
Who are you?

284
00:25:41,063 --> 00:25:44,829
Why are they all females?

285
00:26:01,383 --> 00:26:04,045
TV piracy is a felony, pal.

286
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:06,644
You could get eight years
of hard labor in prison.

287
00:26:06,722 --> 00:26:10,522
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Rene D'Anclaude.

288
00:26:10,592 --> 00:26:12,617
It's my name.

289
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:16,095
So just who do you think you are, mister?

290
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:20,294
There are other things
to concern yourselves with.

291
00:26:20,368 --> 00:26:23,030
Let me show you.

292
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:30,036
Robots are disguising themselves as humans.

293
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:32,046
Am I wrong?

294
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:34,378
It's my duty to do something about this.

295
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:38,886
You must be rid of
those so-called Thirds.

296
00:26:38,954 --> 00:26:41,115
First contestant.

297
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:43,487
This is Jessica Manning.

298
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:46,618
- Shit.
- A snobbish, bourgeois artist...

299
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:49,027
who lives and works right here among you.

300
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:51,031
She had you all fooled.

301
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:53,966
What should we do about her?

302
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:32,572
Hey, are you okay?
Where's Miss Manning?

303
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:34,768
Jessica!
Save her, please!

304
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:37,437
Why?

305
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:48,211
It's all right.
You just wait here.

306
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,918
Robots, get out!

307
00:27:53,995 --> 00:27:57,089
Let me through!
Police! Hey!

308
00:27:57,165 --> 00:28:01,465
Give us back our jobs.

309
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:07,101
Get out right now!

310
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:20,885
It's them.
The list of Thirds.

311
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,822
Yes. And then?
No, wait!

312
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:44,307
Good-bye, Jessica.

313
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,132
Slow down!

314
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:06,383
You, of all people,
should understand my work.

315
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:09,487
After all, didn't a cyborg
kill your partner?

316
00:30:09,564 --> 00:30:12,431
They're a pestilence.

317
00:30:16,438 --> 00:30:19,601
But your leg.

318
00:30:26,014 --> 00:30:29,177
Hey, sailor, what's this?

319
00:30:33,188 --> 00:30:36,351
You've gotta be kidding.
A fake leg?

320
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:40,360
Surely the ironic humor
of this hasn't escaped you.

321
00:30:40,428 --> 00:30:44,694
You're almost
a stinking cyborg yourself, you freak.

322
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,808
What's that?

323
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:29,302
It's you.

324
00:31:29,377 --> 00:31:32,175
Until now, you've never
witnessed the true power of a Third.

325
00:31:32,247 --> 00:31:34,841
Allow me to demonstrate.

326
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:52,361
Here, bitch!
Burn, you misfit!

327
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,793
You monster.

328
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:27,124
Yeah, that's right.
I'm a monster.

329
00:32:27,202 --> 00:32:30,569
Just another name for a Third in your book.

330
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:33,198
What are you gonna do,
destroy me? Why?

331
00:32:33,274 --> 00:32:35,299
What did we ever do to humans?

332
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:37,640
If humans don't want me,
then why did they create me?

333
00:32:43,451 --> 00:32:47,478
Don't do it!
Just cuff him!

334
00:32:47,555 --> 00:32:50,115
You're a police officer first, Armitage,

335
00:32:50,191 --> 00:32:52,182
and you know what your duty is.

336
00:32:54,462 --> 00:32:56,692
Armitage, it doesn't matter
that you're a Third.

337
00:32:56,764 --> 00:33:00,200
You're a cop, and you're my partner.

338
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:20,019
No, don't look at me.

339
00:33:29,097 --> 00:33:32,191
You'd already figured out
that I wasn't a human, didn't you?

340
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:35,430
I feel like some kind of grotesque puppet.

341
00:33:35,503 --> 00:33:37,562
I can walk and talk...

342
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:41,131
and I can laugh and I can cry.

343
00:33:43,545 --> 00:33:45,979
But I'm only a monstrous doll.

344
00:33:47,682 --> 00:33:51,311
No!

345
00:34:00,595 --> 00:34:03,462
Armitage carries
a special A-class license.

346
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:06,056
- I know.
- But she chose to become a cop.

347
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:08,216
A good one. You understand
what I'm getting at?

348
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:10,298
Yeah.

349
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:14,137
The reason she disappeared
is because of you, Ross.

350
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:17,610
Lieutenant Randolph, you can interrogate
me all you want. I'm used to it.

351
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,943
Ross, that won't be necessary.

352
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:22,614
If you say you don't know anything,
that's good enough for me...

353
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,584
and leave it at that.

354
00:34:24,652 --> 00:34:28,645
I'm no Sherlock Holmes, but I've learned
from experience to follow my instinct.

355
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:31,487
I have a hunch there's
some kind of connection...

356
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:35,552
between Armitage and the killing
of the Third types.

357
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,861
This could get real fun.

358
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:42,801
If an officer is rumored to be
a humanoid, the shit could hit the fan,

359
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,397
so let's keep this
between you, me and the wall.

360
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:49,307
Armitage isn't a good cop.
She's a great one.

361
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:26,643
Always hurts like hell when the rain comes.

362
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,694
Start message.

363
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:43,560
Hey, where are you?
Are you okay?

364
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:45,895
Your partner's concerned.

365
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:50,028
Lieutenant Randolph's no dummy.
He suspects you're a Third.

366
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:52,231
It appears D'Anclaude
is working with someone,

367
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:55,208
because Thirds are still being murdered.

368
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:59,645
Armitage, don't let bitterness
change you. Come back, please.

369
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:27,337
This makes number seven.
God, I think I'm gonna puke.

370
00:36:27,408 --> 00:36:29,535
Who the hell is doing this?

371
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,773
I can only think of two people
with the means and motivation.

372
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:37,580
I'm talking about Rene
D'Anclaude and Armitage.

373
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:40,280
- What's that?
- Yeah, I know.

374
00:36:40,355 --> 00:36:43,552
It's weird to think about,
but she talked to me about it once.

375
00:36:43,624 --> 00:36:47,219
She pities the robots used for crime,
so she kills them quickly.

376
00:36:47,295 --> 00:36:49,729
But I can't believe she'd actually...

377
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:56,135
Not on your life. Sure, the village
is artsy, but downtown is a pit.

378
00:36:56,204 --> 00:36:58,138
I wouldn't move there for anything.

379
00:36:58,206 --> 00:37:01,334
I've got to get some writing done.
I'll talk to you later.

380
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:06,313
Continue writing mode.

381
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:09,316
Novel in progress: untitled.

382
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:14,184
Chapter two, paragraph five.

383
00:37:16,257 --> 00:37:18,987
How could she greet the ones
from the deep far away?

384
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,291
She, who has spent a pleasant
and enchanting afternoon,

385
00:37:22,363 --> 00:37:26,026
who had never given a thought
about the person from the Louis.

386
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,901
The same one who once
picked her up now cold and dead.

387
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:32,906
A phantom.

388
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:47,943
Her battle with the old gods ended.

389
00:37:48,022 --> 00:37:51,822
As a spiritual truce was struck,
she felt her soul unburdened.

390
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:56,353
She smiled. Already, the feeling
of harmony was...

391
00:37:57,765 --> 00:38:00,325
Who's there?
Who are you?

392
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:02,665
Are you Armitage?

393
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:06,429
Are you the one who contacted me?

394
00:38:06,507 --> 00:38:09,476
You fooled me.

395
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:27,288
I don't wanna die.
I don't wan...

396
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:36,267
Do you mean that Armitage is a suspect?

397
00:38:36,337 --> 00:38:38,669
Well, you can't just deny the evidence.

398
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:40,673
The woman's last words said it all.

399
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:42,675
The whole department is shocked,

400
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:45,007
but the lieutenant had suspicions
about her all along.

401
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,639
He's already issued
a warrant for her arrest,

402
00:38:47,715 --> 00:38:49,649
and there's an A.P.B.
out on her.

403
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:51,878
Why that sly old dog.

404
00:38:51,953 --> 00:38:54,979
Access mail.
Log file: Armitage.

405
00:38:55,056 --> 00:38:56,990
Open file.

406
00:38:59,393 --> 00:39:01,327
This is Pluto.

407
00:39:01,395 --> 00:39:03,011
It's Pluto.

408
00:39:03,012 --> 00:39:05,052
I'm sending this message
by use of Armitage's I.D.

409
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,005
I'm a Third, just like
you and all the others.

410
00:39:07,006 --> 00:39:08,226
Hey, Chris.

411
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:12,238
- Find out where this mail originated from.
- You got it.

412
00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:24,015
Wanna see a movie Saturday?

413
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:29,915
Hey, I was worried about you.

414
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:32,186
I used to love the playground after school.

415
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,194
I was a pretty clumsy kid, though.

416
00:39:34,262 --> 00:39:37,254
I took a tumble off the seesaw once
and bawled all the way home.

417
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:40,266
Listen, did you know that M.P.D.
has been searching for you?

418
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:48,032
But you're looking
for Pluto, right? Let's go.

419
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:50,304
- Armitage?
- What?

420
00:39:50,378 --> 00:39:53,040
I believe in you.

421
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,421
There! That's him. I'm sure of it.

422
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,220
But he's a boy.

423
00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:08,558
How do you do, Pluto?
It's nice to meet you.

424
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:10,722
Please don't call me by my handle again.

425
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:13,164
You can use my given name:
Julian Moore.

426
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:15,930
I'm sorry.

427
00:40:16,003 --> 00:40:18,130
By the way, shouldn't you be in class?

428
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:21,732
No. I'm transferring my thoughts to the
main memory at the navigation center.

429
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:24,676
- What for?
- What for?

430
00:40:24,745 --> 00:40:28,841
To make a backup of myself, obviously.

431
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:32,249
- Well, let's go.
- Where?

432
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,584
To the memory server
at the ad tower, of course.

433
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:36,816
You wanna learn the purpose of the Thirds?

434
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:39,359
I can't believe it.
You're a Third?

435
00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:42,624
Yes, I'm a Third.
The last one made.

436
00:40:42,697 --> 00:40:44,688
What's wrong?

437
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:46,926
- Why'd the elevator stop
- I don't know.

438
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:57,177
It won't stop.

439
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:07,220
We're dropping pretty fast.
At this rate, we're gonna die for sure.

440
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:11,047
Ross, hold on tight to him.

441
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:14,993
- Do you really think this is gonna work?
- You got any ideas?

442
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:37,082
Ross?

443
00:41:40,488 --> 00:41:44,390
I think my right arm and ribs are broken.

444
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:54,730
Armitage, don't get any closer!

445
00:41:54,802 --> 00:41:57,270
Damn you.

446
00:42:00,341 --> 00:42:02,536
He's fast.

447
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:05,010
Come on!
We gotta run for it!

448
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:07,843
- Go on. Leave me here.
- No!

449
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:11,009
I'll help you.
Let's go!

450
00:42:35,943 --> 00:42:40,039
My God.

451
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:42,582
Ross.

452
00:42:47,455 --> 00:42:50,652
It looks like the only choice is to fight.

453
00:43:19,253 --> 00:43:21,221
Move out!

454
00:43:21,222 --> 00:43:23,662
If Armitage is killed, then
there's gonna be no hope for me.

455
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:37,530
It's D'Anclaude.
I just don't believe it.

456
00:43:37,605 --> 00:43:40,506
Surprise, surprise.

457
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:42,508
Did you miss me?

458
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:45,306
You son of a bitch!

459
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:58,513
I won't let you die alone, cheri.

460
00:43:58,592 --> 00:44:00,958
The other two will join you.

461
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:06,190
Fucking bastard!

462
00:44:06,267 --> 00:44:08,895
He's not human.

463
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:13,633
Nice right hook, but now I'm going to crush
the three of you and get on with my life.

464
00:44:13,707 --> 00:44:16,335
I have places to go and robots to kill.

465
00:44:23,951 --> 00:44:25,851
What the...

466
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,323
Hi there. Bon voyage, Rene.

467
00:44:30,391 --> 00:44:32,655
You crazy bitch!
Give me the keys!

468
00:44:32,726 --> 00:44:35,695
- Please, unlock it.
- Bye-bye.

469
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:49,404
I'm curious. Why aren't
other Thirds as strong as you?

470
00:44:49,476 --> 00:44:53,344
Security should be here any minute.
I'm sure they'll take care of you.

471
00:44:53,414 --> 00:44:55,848
No, you don't have to run and hide now.

472
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:58,180
Officers don't leave their injured behind.

473
00:45:04,925 --> 00:45:08,793
You're cold, lady.

474
00:45:21,175 --> 00:45:24,804
I will always be cold.

475
00:45:24,879 --> 00:45:26,813
Armitage.

476
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:41,556
I'm amazed he survived
with all the injuries he sustained.

477
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:45,326
His entire chest area was damaged,
and the right arm was severed.

478
00:45:45,399 --> 00:45:49,028
Over 50 percent of his body
will be artificial replacement parts.

479
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:51,537
Isn't that gonna be
a problem for a policeman?

480
00:45:51,605 --> 00:45:55,507
For a recruit, maybe,
but not for this cowboy.

481
00:46:04,285 --> 00:46:06,685
I hope you feel better than you look.

482
00:46:06,754 --> 00:46:09,882
I can't understand
why my other arm hurts so much.

483
00:46:09,957 --> 00:46:12,790
The doctor threw in some kind
of new nervous system for you,

484
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,920
so it's probably just a side effect.

485
00:46:15,996 --> 00:46:19,591
At any rate, there's something
I wanna show you.

486
00:46:23,404 --> 00:46:27,033
It's Kelly McCanon. Why haven't they
disposed of her body yet?

487
00:46:27,107 --> 00:46:29,371
Hey, she's a real find.

488
00:46:29,443 --> 00:46:31,775
You just don't throw
something like her away.

489
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:35,372
Except for a few functions,
Thirds are perfect synthetic organisms.

490
00:46:35,449 --> 00:46:39,146
They can simulate every physical aspect
of the human body.

491
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:42,154
The big mystery that's had everybody
running in circles is:

492
00:46:42,222 --> 00:46:44,986
Why have all the Thirds
been female? Do you know?

493
00:46:47,962 --> 00:46:49,987
After the victims were autopsied,

494
00:46:50,064 --> 00:46:53,227
we discovered that this wasn't
just a case of robot destruction.

495
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,393
It was murder.
I'll show ya.

496
00:46:57,938 --> 00:47:02,568
Our country-western singer?
She was pregnant.

497
00:47:02,643 --> 00:47:06,704
No stinking robot can play a guitar
and sing the way Kelly does.

498
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,180
I'm her manager.
I know her better than anybody.

499
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:11,183
She's the most human woman I know.

500
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:31,769
I can't believe
I'm capable of giving birth.

501
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,468
Quite a revelation, isn't it? That's
the whole purpose of the Third types.

502
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:38,102
You can step beyond the bounds
of conventional robots...

503
00:47:38,178 --> 00:47:41,443
just by getting pregnant, Mommy Armitage.

504
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:48,087
Not funny.
It's too weird.

505
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:52,050
But you, what's your role?

506
00:47:52,126 --> 00:47:54,651
I'm still trying to figure that out.

507
00:47:54,728 --> 00:47:57,356
What's the point in creating a male kid?

508
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:59,956
The C.P.U. showed
my serial number...

509
00:48:00,034 --> 00:48:03,003
as the last Third made.

510
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,561
The final model off the line.

511
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:07,903
Not quite.
We can breed now.

512
00:48:07,975 --> 00:48:11,570
Now I understand why the Thirds
were made to seem so human,

513
00:48:11,645 --> 00:48:13,840
not just in appearance but emotionally,

514
00:48:13,914 --> 00:48:16,382
like the murdered singer and that novelist.

515
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,782
They weren't just machines.
They had souls.

516
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:21,844
It takes more than
the right plumbing to procreate.

517
00:48:21,922 --> 00:48:26,086
Yes, sir.
The perfect receptacle for human babies.

518
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,527
What the hell's so funny,

519
00:48:29,596 --> 00:48:31,530
- Jerk.
- Tsk-tsk.

520
00:48:31,598 --> 00:48:33,828
What's the matter?
Have I touched a nerve?

521
00:48:33,901 --> 00:48:35,869
Maternal clock ticking?

522
00:48:35,936 --> 00:48:39,838
Maybe you'd like
Detective Ross to set your alarm.

523
00:48:39,907 --> 00:48:44,310
Shut up!

524
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:46,710
I was just kidding.

525
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,772
Julian, do you know why they made us?

526
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,784
I don't,

527
00:48:51,852 --> 00:48:55,219
but I'll bet Asakura does.

528
00:48:55,289 --> 00:48:59,191
Or D'Anclaude.
He must have some part in this.

529
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,482
How are you feeling?
Have you made a full recovery?

530
00:49:09,505 --> 00:49:13,066
Yeah, I'm fine. It takes time
getting used to these new body parts.

531
00:49:13,141 --> 00:49:15,473
- Ironic, isn't it?
- What?

532
00:49:15,544 --> 00:49:19,674
Little by little, you're becoming
like the robot you hate so much.

533
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,841
Let's get down to business, shall we?

534
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,977
Why is the investigation of the Thirds over?
That doesn't make sense.

535
00:49:25,053 --> 00:49:27,578
- Maybe it does.
- Bullshit.

536
00:49:27,656 --> 00:49:30,420
But we have to follow orders
in this department.

537
00:49:30,492 --> 00:49:34,121
- Tell me, was the decision forced?
- I'll tell you what it is.

538
00:49:34,196 --> 00:49:37,324
It's a goddamned order
that you're gonna follow.

539
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:41,597
The Third investigation is over
because the murderer was apprehended.

540
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:45,299
Even after we've discovered that Thirds
are robots that can actually conceive.

541
00:49:45,374 --> 00:49:47,308
Why stop here?

542
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:49,867
- D'Anclaude's under full guard.
- Yeah, right.

543
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:53,437
He's over at Shenora General
Government Hospital.

544
00:49:53,515 --> 00:49:55,882
I can't accept the contradictory
report that you filed.

545
00:49:55,883 --> 00:49:58,248
But, sir!

546
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,689
Our job is to investigate
and arrest technological criminals.

547
00:50:02,758 --> 00:50:05,659
Don't you forget it.
That's all I have to say for now.

548
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:12,600
Ironic, isn't it?

549
00:50:12,668 --> 00:50:17,162
Little by little, you're becoming
like the robot you hate so much.

550
00:50:29,885 --> 00:50:34,788
That's where all my memory was backed up
and stored. I'm saved for posterity.

551
00:50:34,856 --> 00:50:38,485
- And if we're all murdered, you know...
- Will you give it a rest?

552
00:50:50,606 --> 00:50:52,540
Ha! Bingo!

553
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:59,212
Warning: Only authorized personnel
are permitted within the memory bank.

554
00:50:59,281 --> 00:51:02,717
Please vacate this area at once.

555
00:51:02,784 --> 00:51:06,686
We're lost.
Which way is magnetic north?

556
00:51:06,755 --> 00:51:08,780
There is no department by that name.

557
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,382
You must vacate within ten seconds or...

558
00:51:15,998 --> 00:51:18,899
Asakura was quite a designer.

559
00:51:18,967 --> 00:51:23,631
He created the ultimate woman
who could kick ass and raise children.

560
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:26,799
He designed you too.

561
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,366
Yeah, but I can't get pregnant.

562
00:51:35,183 --> 00:51:37,879
That's it.

563
00:51:48,263 --> 00:51:52,723
Here goes. I hate that
this is the easiest way.

564
00:51:56,138 --> 00:51:58,072
Hey, will you hurry up?

565
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,041
Hey, I'm doing this for you.
It hurts like hell, so shut up.

566
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:04,135
I need to know about myself.

567
00:52:04,212 --> 00:52:06,077
Who am I and why?

568
00:52:07,616 --> 00:52:10,551
I'll look.

569
00:52:14,022 --> 00:52:16,490
I'm searching for Asakura's file.

570
00:52:19,127 --> 00:52:21,061
Armitage?

571
00:52:21,129 --> 00:52:23,063
Help me out.

572
00:52:23,131 --> 00:52:25,258
My virtual monitor.

573
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:28,063
- Yeah?
- Open it from my navigational system.

574
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:33,070
Good. I've located
the still image file.

575
00:52:33,141 --> 00:52:35,075
Hold on.
Just another second.

576
00:52:42,984 --> 00:52:46,647
That's my father,

577
00:52:46,722 --> 00:52:49,156
but why is he standing next to D'Anclaude?

578
00:52:51,326 --> 00:52:54,318
I don't believe it.

579
00:52:56,932 --> 00:52:58,866
Julian!

580
00:52:58,934 --> 00:53:02,267
Damn it!
I think someone's discovered me.

581
00:53:02,337 --> 00:53:04,328
You're logging off now!

582
00:53:08,744 --> 00:53:12,145
God. Something's in me.

583
00:53:12,214 --> 00:53:15,672
Please help me.

584
00:53:24,426 --> 00:53:27,122
Little Naomi Armitage...

585
00:53:27,195 --> 00:53:29,993
went looking for knowledge
and only found trouble.

586
00:53:30,065 --> 00:53:33,899
You can't stop the Third types
from being killed, my dear.

587
00:53:42,978 --> 00:53:46,573
Shoot me.
I don't mind.

588
00:53:46,648 --> 00:53:50,744
Pull the trigger.
I dare you.

589
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:57,151
So, you're not a human.
Are you a Third type?

590
00:53:57,225 --> 00:54:02,595
You won't find my name in the membership
of that club for failures.

591
00:54:02,664 --> 00:54:04,791
What are you saying?

592
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:08,700
You make me wretch.
Cheap imitations pretending to be human.

593
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,704
There's no comparison to our superiority.

594
00:54:10,772 --> 00:54:13,502
I couldn't agree
with humans more on one thing.

595
00:54:13,575 --> 00:54:17,443
All Thirds should be annihilated.

596
00:54:20,682 --> 00:54:23,344
I'll kill you!

597
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:38,595
Julian.

598
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:40,601
No.

599
00:54:40,669 --> 00:54:43,137
That bastard's not the original.

600
00:54:43,205 --> 00:54:45,298
My God.

601
00:54:45,373 --> 00:54:47,705
What's wrong?

602
00:54:47,706 --> 00:54:50,037
I'm going. I'll finally
meet the real D'Anclaude.

603
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,944
Get back!

604
00:54:59,054 --> 00:55:02,546
A-Armitage, good-bye.

605
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:06,424
No, Julian. No!

606
00:55:13,535 --> 00:55:16,800
Hey, R-Ross.

607
00:55:16,872 --> 00:55:19,841
- Ross!
- No.

608
00:55:19,908 --> 00:55:22,502
Ross, I need your help.

609
00:55:22,577 --> 00:55:24,636
It's D'Anclaude again.
Please. I need you.

610
00:55:24,713 --> 00:55:27,477
Something happened to Julian.
We need you. Ross, don't...

611
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,915
So one of my men got
a little carried away. Well...

612
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:38,016
I'm Judicial Vice Minister Jessup,

613
00:55:38,093 --> 00:55:42,052
and I'm visiting as a representative
of the Legal Affairs Bureau.

614
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,327
I need an accurate picture
of the M.P.D.'s operations.

615
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,164
I'm just a bit confused.

616
00:55:48,236 --> 00:55:50,796
Help me to understand why an inspector...

617
00:55:50,872 --> 00:55:53,534
from Earth's government has come here,

618
00:55:53,608 --> 00:55:55,542
Don't mind me, Lieutenant.

619
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:57,874
I'm simply an observer
for Mr. Jessup.

620
00:55:57,946 --> 00:56:00,278
Think of me merely as a fly on the wall.

621
00:56:03,351 --> 00:56:06,149
Well, since you're observing,
I'm sure you've noticed...

622
00:56:06,221 --> 00:56:10,180
that the robots here on Mars
don't quite reflect a feminist society.

623
00:56:10,258 --> 00:56:12,556
Very well.

624
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:16,154
You understand us,
Mr., Randolph.

625
00:56:16,231 --> 00:56:18,859
Let's call it a day and have lunch.

626
00:57:06,948 --> 00:57:10,384
I'm sick of the whole damn system.

627
00:57:15,156 --> 00:57:17,249
Armitage,

628
00:57:18,827 --> 00:57:22,593
didn't Julian say he had
his memory backup stored somewhere?

629
00:57:22,664 --> 00:57:25,690
- The backup?
- That's right.

630
00:57:25,767 --> 00:57:29,134
If we can somehow access his data,
we could still bring him back.

631
00:57:29,204 --> 00:57:31,138
Get it?

632
00:57:32,774 --> 00:57:36,710
His body's gone, but his mind's alive.

633
00:57:39,814 --> 00:57:43,716
Funny, I didn't think
I would miss him so much.

634
00:57:43,785 --> 00:57:47,414
Maybe his information will help us
and avenge his death as well.

635
00:57:47,489 --> 00:57:50,890
Julian said he was gonna meet
the real D'Anclaude.

636
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:53,894
Maybe he was telling us
we could do the same.

637
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,366
- Ross?
- Shenora, right?

638
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,902
Will you come with me?

639
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,240
- What's up?
- The internal troops are active.

640
00:58:11,312 --> 00:58:13,246
- Are we at war?
- No.

641
00:58:13,314 --> 00:58:15,908
- They're guarding.
- What, the president?

642
00:58:15,984 --> 00:58:18,248
- No, Shenora Hospital.
- Shenora?

643
00:58:26,027 --> 00:58:28,461
Jesus H. Christ,
will you look at that arsenal?

644
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,464
What the hell are they doing there?

645
00:58:30,532 --> 00:58:33,933
Hold on a minute.
I'm picking up something.

646
00:58:34,002 --> 00:58:37,870
What is it?
It's just a car.

647
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:48,880
Holy shit.

648
00:59:00,562 --> 00:59:03,554
They've lost it.

649
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:05,997
Fire!

650
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:55,148
Here.

651
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:08,661
It's him.

652
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,824
Finally, the real D'Anclaude.

653
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,529
Or should I say
Dr. Rene D'Anclaude?

654
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:24,801
You must be...

655
01:00:24,879 --> 01:00:28,815
Asakura's daughter, the failure.

656
01:00:33,054 --> 01:00:35,682
We gotta hurry.
Come on.

657
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,351
Let's go while we still can.

658
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:41,486
What's the matter?

659
01:00:41,563 --> 01:00:45,431
Ross.

660
01:00:47,835 --> 01:00:50,395
- Something's coming.
- What is it?

661
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:05,750
- Not again.
- D'Anclaude. There's no way.

662
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,449
Hey, let's rumba.

663
01:01:16,864 --> 01:01:19,765
Over here!

664
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:26,072
This way! Hurry!

665
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:33,607
Wait! Don't run off!
I wanna play with you!

666
01:01:41,222 --> 01:01:43,713
Come on. Wait.

667
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:47,522
There's no way
that damn gargoyle's a Third type.

668
01:01:47,595 --> 01:01:50,530
My, look who's talking?

669
01:01:50,598 --> 01:01:53,396
Don't tell me you have no clue
who your brother was.

670
01:01:53,468 --> 01:01:57,336
You have more in common with that prototype
gargoyle than you might realize.

671
01:01:57,405 --> 01:02:00,465
- Did you truly believe you were a Third?
- Liar.

672
01:02:00,541 --> 01:02:03,908
You can always ask Asakura,
but he's tucked away safely...

673
01:02:03,978 --> 01:02:05,912
in a dome on Dunwich Hill.

674
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,414
Armitage.

675
01:02:08,483 --> 01:02:10,747
- Don't stop.
- No!

676
01:02:10,818 --> 01:02:14,686
No. I can always tell
when you're gonna do something crazy.

677
01:02:18,393 --> 01:02:20,327
Hi, kids.

678
01:02:20,395 --> 01:02:22,522
Does she want a showdown?

679
01:02:22,597 --> 01:02:24,588
We'll both go down fighting.

680
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:29,501
That'll make everyone happy, 'cause
you know, nobody on Mars wants us here.

681
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,970
Wrong!
You're the one who's through.

682
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,873
No!

683
01:02:46,821 --> 01:02:50,689
No!

684
01:03:00,335 --> 01:03:04,032
Human suffering is such
a unique privilege, isn't it?

685
01:03:04,105 --> 01:03:06,801
He's pure data!
Cease function!

686
01:03:15,383 --> 01:03:18,716
Next in the news: the Martian
Police Department is investigating...

687
01:03:18,786 --> 01:03:21,550
the terrorist attack
at Shenora General Government Hospital,

688
01:03:21,622 --> 01:03:24,216
which occurred during
an anti-robot demonstration.

689
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:27,455
The police are asking for our viewers'
help in locating these two suspects:

690
01:03:27,528 --> 01:03:30,190
Ross Sylibus and Naomi Armitage.

691
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,391
The M.P.D. confirms there
is a definite connection.

692
01:03:32,467 --> 01:03:36,665
If you have any information,
please notify the police.

693
01:03:36,738 --> 01:03:39,002
Yuck.

694
01:03:51,419 --> 01:03:54,388
Let me pick out our next meeting place,
okay? Tables with umbrellas.

695
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:58,050
If that makes you too sick, I know
a vending machine and a clean bench.

696
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,287
I guess maybe this is the worst place.

697
01:04:00,361 --> 01:04:03,262
Worst place?
Only if I was in your shoes.

698
01:04:03,331 --> 01:04:05,822
Will you cut the crap?
Did you find anything?

699
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:10,098
Yeah. Your Dunwich Hill exists,
but not on any map.

700
01:04:10,171 --> 01:04:12,696
I found a good highway
going smack blank into a mountain,

701
01:04:12,774 --> 01:04:17,541
but no Asakura address box
inviting any mail from a rogue cop.

702
01:04:17,612 --> 01:04:20,240
No topographicals?

703
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:24,876
Come on. Like I really got
a couple of moons to power this thing.

704
01:04:24,952 --> 01:04:27,546
- Hey, what are you doing?
- A loss on duty.

705
01:04:27,622 --> 01:04:29,556
Yeah, the dearly departed.

706
01:04:32,293 --> 01:04:35,091
Hey, Ross!

707
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:39,156
Can you tell those guys... the Martians...
Tell 'em Eddie says, "What's up?"

708
01:04:39,233 --> 01:04:41,064
Sure.

709
01:04:44,472 --> 01:04:46,906
So, what's wrong?

710
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,244
Well, are you gonna tell me?

711
01:04:57,485 --> 01:04:59,419
Are you okay?

712
01:04:59,487 --> 01:05:03,150
No, I'm not.
My C.P.U.'s all messed up.

713
01:05:03,224 --> 01:05:06,682
They say the mind's
the first thing to go. Humans say.

714
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:09,525
Come on, Armitage.
Machines don't go senile.

715
01:05:09,597 --> 01:05:12,430
They also say life is pretty short.

716
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,196
It's like an expiration date, you know?

717
01:05:17,271 --> 01:05:20,001
- Hey, how come...
- What?

718
01:05:20,074 --> 01:05:24,010
What's the reason you're doing
all of this for me,

719
01:05:24,078 --> 01:05:27,946
How come you're still with me and
driving me all the way out here anyway?

720
01:05:28,015 --> 01:05:31,883
I mean, why change from
a good cop to a criminal?

721
01:05:31,953 --> 01:05:34,421
How come...

722
01:05:34,489 --> 01:05:38,687
Stop it! You're asking
stupid questions like some little kid.

723
01:05:38,759 --> 01:05:43,389
Why? How come?
There's no answer.

724
01:05:57,979 --> 01:05:59,913
That's it, isn't it?

725
01:05:59,981 --> 01:06:01,915
Coordinates.

726
01:06:03,951 --> 01:06:06,010
"Virgin"?

727
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,749
Yeah, maybe if you just landed here.

728
01:06:10,324 --> 01:06:13,589
Hey, it wastes fuel
to keep the motor running.

729
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,686
Yo! Anybody here?

730
01:06:44,525 --> 01:06:46,789
We're looking for a guy called Asakura!

731
01:06:46,861 --> 01:06:49,227
Is anyone here?

732
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:52,596
You got visitors!

733
01:06:56,103 --> 01:06:58,264
What happened?

734
01:06:58,339 --> 01:07:02,241
All right, take it easy.
Move away from it nice and slow.

735
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,778
Don't shoot.
It's only a robot.

736
01:07:04,845 --> 01:07:06,710
Yeah, a big one.

737
01:07:06,781 --> 01:07:08,840
It's somehow just like me.

738
01:07:08,916 --> 01:07:10,850
I think it's a bioroid type.

739
01:07:10,918 --> 01:07:13,443
Is it some kind of prototype?

740
01:07:13,521 --> 01:07:15,648
May I help you?

741
01:07:24,065 --> 01:07:27,899
- Talk about your family trees.
- It's another D'Anclaude.

742
01:07:27,969 --> 01:07:30,028
That same face and voice.

743
01:07:30,104 --> 01:07:32,834
I heard someone calling
for Dr. Asakura.

744
01:07:32,907 --> 01:07:34,898
I did.

745
01:07:37,411 --> 01:07:41,677
Appointment?
No, I suppose not.

746
01:07:41,749 --> 01:07:44,013
Would you follow me, please?

747
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:50,980
- Dr. Asakura, visitors. A Mr...
- Sylibus.

748
01:07:51,058 --> 01:07:53,117
Papa?

749
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:57,062
The new man from Conception.

750
01:07:57,131 --> 01:07:59,190
It's been so many years,

751
01:07:59,266 --> 01:08:02,292
and you even brought
one of the models along.

752
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,304
Mr. Sylibus.

753
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:06,840
- But I'm not...
- Papa.

754
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:13,445
But she's only a Third.
She's so inferior.

755
01:08:13,514 --> 01:08:17,610
The poor little thing.
But you needn't be so kind.

756
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:20,313
It's outdated.
I'm sorry.

757
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:23,516
Here. Take a look at this.

758
01:08:23,591 --> 01:08:27,254
A Fourth type that Conception
can be proud of.

759
01:08:27,328 --> 01:08:30,923
There's no longer any need
to copy humans or plants anymore.

760
01:08:32,266 --> 01:08:35,531
They live.
They're alives.

761
01:08:35,603 --> 01:08:37,867
No, we should
call them "phobians."

762
01:08:37,938 --> 01:08:41,533
What? Yes, a new life,
my Marforteans, but you won't.

763
01:08:41,609 --> 01:08:45,511
You'll just be calling them
anything you want when you market them.

764
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:48,047
The stupid company you work for...

765
01:08:48,115 --> 01:08:50,811
is just going to call them
"the Fourths," aren't they?

766
01:08:50,885 --> 01:08:55,049
They're alives. A grand conception.
Then it all goes wrong.

767
01:08:57,124 --> 01:08:59,718
The doctor's mind
was unfortunately altered.

768
01:08:59,794 --> 01:09:02,922
Reduplication of
his thoughts is very difficult.

769
01:09:02,997 --> 01:09:04,931
Please, be patient.

770
01:09:04,999 --> 01:09:08,867
- His memory, was it erased?
- Who are you?

771
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,904
I am Wilbur D'Anclaude...

772
01:09:10,971 --> 01:09:14,236
and Dr. Asakura's aide.

773
01:09:14,308 --> 01:09:16,640
Well, yeah, he might look to you like...

774
01:09:16,711 --> 01:09:19,236
he's one of those
damn "assassinroids."

775
01:09:19,313 --> 01:09:21,440
But I fixed up his crazy head,

776
01:09:21,515 --> 01:09:23,449
just as you can see.

777
01:09:23,517 --> 01:09:25,849
Indeed he did.

778
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,754
The violent tendencies
I had are now gone due to the upgrade.

779
01:09:29,824 --> 01:09:32,088
- What's the reason?
- Pardon?

780
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:35,651
Dr. Asakura, his mind.
Just what's wrong with it?

781
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:38,062
Forget it, Ross.

782
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,033
That's enough.

783
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:52,237
Are you still cold?

784
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,873
Yes, it's affecting my nervous system.

785
01:09:54,949 --> 01:09:56,883
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

786
01:09:56,951 --> 01:10:00,944
I was... just hoping the doctor
would be able to help you somehow.

787
01:10:02,189 --> 01:10:04,817
Never count on hope.
You'll lose.

788
01:10:04,892 --> 01:10:09,727
When wishes are gone, hope gives nothing.

789
01:10:09,797 --> 01:10:13,062
And then you hope
that your father might know,

790
01:10:13,134 --> 01:10:16,467
and hopes are really fragile.

791
01:10:16,537 --> 01:10:19,802
They get all ruined
every time you believe...

792
01:10:19,874 --> 01:10:23,469
that somebody else
is gonna help your hopes come true.

793
01:10:27,148 --> 01:10:31,482
A hope is a feeling.
Maybe you'll be okay.

794
01:10:31,552 --> 01:10:34,077
If I was a Second,

795
01:10:34,155 --> 01:10:38,421
then I wouldn't even be able
to think of all this stupid crap.

796
01:10:38,492 --> 01:10:41,393
But I'm programmed to be a human,

797
01:10:41,462 --> 01:10:44,090
and I don't even know what that means.

798
01:10:44,165 --> 01:10:47,191
Hope is a human feeling, isn't it, Ross?

799
01:10:47,268 --> 01:10:50,135
- Come on. Tell me more.
- Hey, I know one.

800
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:53,765
He's a human, and he's less real...

801
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:56,674
than all of the things
you're talking about.

802
01:10:56,744 --> 01:11:01,010
You wanna know what he said?
"Don't give up."

803
01:11:03,584 --> 01:11:05,518
Ross.

804
01:11:14,695 --> 01:11:16,629
Are you sure?

805
01:11:16,697 --> 01:11:19,791
Armitage, I think it's the only thing
I've been sure of since I got here.

806
01:11:19,867 --> 01:11:23,200
How about you?

807
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:27,707
Well, at least something
is normal here on Mars.

808
01:11:33,314 --> 01:11:36,511
But I'm not normal.
I'm a robot.

809
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,518
I'm half robot too,

810
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,918
but I know a true heart when I've met one.

811
01:11:43,557 --> 01:11:46,321
We interrupt this broadcast
for the following announcement.

812
01:11:46,393 --> 01:11:48,861
Good evening:
We've just received word that,

813
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:51,090
as of 11:00 p.m. U.T.N. time,

814
01:11:51,165 --> 01:11:53,224
the economic agreement
has been signed at last.

815
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,700
Mars and Earth
have finally signed the treaty.

816
01:11:55,769 --> 01:11:57,862
Officials from both powers
are quoted as saying:

817
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:01,430
"This is a first step
toward one world, one nation."

818
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:17,819
Follow me. There's something
I'd like to show you.

819
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:23,762
- Where's the doc?
- This morning, he's with his alives.

820
01:12:23,831 --> 01:12:27,130
He's concentrating on
further hybridization.

821
01:12:27,201 --> 01:12:29,726
He intends to continue and complete...

822
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:32,829
the initial terra-forming plans.

823
01:12:32,907 --> 01:12:35,273
- But that's impossible.
- Yes,

824
01:12:35,342 --> 01:12:38,505
rational thought would agree.

825
01:12:38,579 --> 01:12:42,140
Don't worry.

826
01:12:42,216 --> 01:12:45,947
The unborn sister poses no threat.

827
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:48,454
Dr. Asakura gave up
weapon production.

828
01:12:48,522 --> 01:12:51,582
He left this new model
unfinished. But why?

829
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:54,651
A difference of opinion with his partner
Professor D'Anclaude.

830
01:12:54,728 --> 01:12:58,255
I... That's enough.
Let's go.

831
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,165
Is there something else?

832
01:13:01,235 --> 01:13:04,432
I brought you here because I felt
you had previous knowledge...

833
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:07,167
of the Third's being created
as "assassinroids."

834
01:13:07,241 --> 01:13:09,573
Nice upgrade. Go on.

835
01:13:09,643 --> 01:13:11,577
It's the unfinished work.

836
01:13:11,645 --> 01:13:14,773
Professor D'Anclaude began work
on female "assassinroids,"

837
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:17,840
which would some way complement
the multitude of my brothers.

838
01:13:17,918 --> 01:13:21,012
Along with myself and Armitage,

839
01:13:21,088 --> 01:13:23,386
we were the pinnacle of robotic creation.

840
01:13:23,457 --> 01:13:26,790
Although our strength and abilities
far surpassed humans,

841
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:30,728
it was quite simple to assimilate
ourselves into their society.

842
01:13:30,798 --> 01:13:34,427
Then Dr. Asakura used us
as a base of synthetic organisms...

843
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:36,435
in developing the Thirds,

844
01:13:36,503 --> 01:13:40,303
programming creativity and life
instead of the directive to destroy.

845
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:44,071
Unfortunately, all the prototypes
had an imperfection.

846
01:13:44,144 --> 01:13:48,547
There were many instabilities within
the logic boards of the Third C.P.U.

847
01:13:48,615 --> 01:13:51,311
Of course, Dr. Asakura's
present state of mind...

848
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:54,548
prevented him from ever quite perfecting
the female models.

849
01:13:54,621 --> 01:13:58,079
I'm nothing. He couldn't finish.
I'm useless.

850
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:01,559
- He doesn't even care!
- No, wait.

851
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:06,457
I don't understand.
Why even create a Third type?

852
01:14:06,533 --> 01:14:09,400
I mean, the Seconds
were good enough, even on Earth.

853
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:12,371
Perhaps being from Earth,
you do not have the knowledge...

854
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:15,101
of the difficulties there are
with low Martian birthrates.

855
01:14:15,175 --> 01:14:19,077
No. I've heard...
What's it mean?

856
01:14:19,146 --> 01:14:21,580
Any colony desiring independence...

857
01:14:21,648 --> 01:14:23,582
requires a populace.

858
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:26,881
Otherwise, they can't
develop a new identity.

859
01:14:26,954 --> 01:14:29,479
And Mars will continue to be weak...

860
01:14:29,556 --> 01:14:33,287
as long as it remains dependent
upon the Earth for its immigration.

861
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,294
Well, what about Conception?

862
01:14:35,362 --> 01:14:38,923
There's got to be more behind it than
just the money that's involved, right?

863
01:14:38,999 --> 01:14:42,127
Indeed. Manufacturers of Thirds,
which can give birth,

864
01:14:42,202 --> 01:14:44,136
gain strength through numbers.

865
01:14:44,204 --> 01:14:47,230
The more people they represent,
the stronger their position grows.

866
01:14:47,307 --> 01:14:51,573
Logical. But then
the assassinations make no sense.

867
01:14:51,645 --> 01:14:54,011
They do, if you're the government...

868
01:14:54,081 --> 01:14:57,050
and hope to sign a treaty
with the Earth Federation.

869
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:10,028
Nah, they couldn't.
Do you think they've really done it?

870
01:15:10,097 --> 01:15:12,088
Mars has no other recourse.

871
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:15,101
The Earth Federation
is now strongly feminist.

872
01:15:15,169 --> 01:15:17,103
A robot who can conceive contradicts...

873
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:20,470
the basis of the Terran party's
position of basic humanity.

874
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:25,535
For Mars to agree,
Mars must eliminate the Thirds.

875
01:15:25,612 --> 01:15:27,546
They are now an obstruction.

876
01:15:27,614 --> 01:15:31,380
Is that what you think, that I'm just
old Martian garbage to be thrown out?

877
01:15:31,452 --> 01:15:33,732
You're wrong. I'm gonna stay
alive for as long as I can.

878
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:35,183
Exactly.

879
01:15:35,255 --> 01:15:37,723
Your programming
for self-preservation...

880
01:15:37,791 --> 01:15:41,420
is exactly equal to ours
for eliminating your kind.

881
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,429
But I am now refined.

882
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:48,127
Unlike my brothers,
I respect your wish for continued life.

883
01:15:50,938 --> 01:15:54,203
- Hey, Eddie.
- He's on suspension...

884
01:15:54,274 --> 01:15:57,141
for aiding a fugitive: section ten.

885
01:15:57,211 --> 01:15:59,839
No, sir, not if I forced him into it.

886
01:15:59,913 --> 01:16:02,143
Perhaps he'll be pardoned.

887
01:16:02,216 --> 01:16:04,241
I'll submit it.

888
01:16:04,318 --> 01:16:06,309
This Dunwich Hill dome...

889
01:16:06,386 --> 01:16:09,719
has become a military attack point.

890
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:12,224
The government has made
its own connections...

891
01:16:12,292 --> 01:16:15,693
between you two
and the terrorist attack at Shenora.

892
01:16:15,762 --> 01:16:17,696
This is an official notice.

893
01:16:17,764 --> 01:16:19,959
You're a threat to the government.

894
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:23,662
The M.P.D. officially denounces
all of your activities.

895
01:16:23,737 --> 01:16:26,205
- So Eddie friggin' squealed.
- He didn't.

896
01:16:26,273 --> 01:16:29,868
How could an officer who I put
on suspension say anything at all?

897
01:16:29,943 --> 01:16:33,344
- Thanks a lot.
- I'm sorry.

898
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:36,572
Sorries aren't good enough.

899
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:39,084
- And just what the hell are we gonna do now?
- Survival.

900
01:16:39,153 --> 01:16:41,417
It's basic training.

901
01:16:41,488 --> 01:16:45,219
Lieutenant Randolph and friends...

902
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:47,760
signing off.

903
01:16:47,828 --> 01:16:49,762
Great.

904
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:51,764
You're in charge.
What now?

905
01:16:53,267 --> 01:16:55,201
We gotta get my father out.

906
01:16:55,269 --> 01:16:58,329
Good morning,
and this morning is our day of new hope.

907
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:02,102
Our planet, often beleaguered
with nightmarish social confusion,

908
01:17:02,176 --> 01:17:06,510
has been finally pieced together again
with the help from our true home world.

909
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,811
Federation chairwoman Everhart
has taken two planets...

910
01:17:09,883 --> 01:17:12,579
and given us one world, one nation.

911
01:17:12,653 --> 01:17:14,814
Today, we are reborn...

912
01:17:14,888 --> 01:17:17,049
as a unified humanity.

913
01:17:19,526 --> 01:17:21,960
They're gonna blow all
of us up straight to hell.

914
01:17:22,029 --> 01:17:24,793
My alives are not yet ready to leave.

915
01:17:24,865 --> 01:17:27,390
They're gonna be your tinder logs
in a few seconds.

916
01:17:27,467 --> 01:17:29,628
- Papa!
- Wilbur,

917
01:17:29,703 --> 01:17:32,228
get the important work into
the old storage backup system.

918
01:17:32,306 --> 01:17:34,968
Don't worry about me.
I'll be safe. It's you I...

919
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:41,578
Maybe you are a nut, but I'm
your damn daughter, and you know it.

920
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:49,955
This is a police order.
Evacuate.

921
01:17:55,229 --> 01:17:59,427
You're still a little fireball,
aren't ya, my Naomi?

922
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:04,301
Papa!

923
01:18:10,377 --> 01:18:12,311
- Armitage!
- She's all right.

924
01:18:12,379 --> 01:18:14,711
You must think I'm a great coward,
Mr. Sylibus,

925
01:18:14,781 --> 01:18:17,181
but if the alives and myself are to die,

926
01:18:17,251 --> 01:18:19,344
I must at least save one thing.

927
01:18:19,419 --> 01:18:21,512
Poor child.

928
01:18:23,957 --> 01:18:26,221
Daddy will fix it.

929
01:18:26,293 --> 01:18:28,727
Daddy will fix his little girl.

930
01:18:32,099 --> 01:18:35,626
There. It's finished,
Naomi. Now you are real.

931
01:18:52,052 --> 01:18:54,953
Last night's slogan
of "one world, one nation"...

932
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:58,890
has this morning blossomed into a new Martian
thought toward "two worlds, one humanity."

933
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:36,393
Hey, listen.

934
01:19:36,463 --> 01:19:40,263
I think Eddie knows a guy who can
hide us as cargo on an Earth shuttle.

935
01:19:40,334 --> 01:19:43,360
I still got friends
who can get you a new I.D.

936
01:19:43,437 --> 01:19:45,371
I don't want that.

937
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:48,203
I'm going back,
back to St. Lowel.

938
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:00,443
I don't wanna see you die.

939
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:04,286
You won't have to.
We'll say good-bye here.

940
01:20:04,358 --> 01:20:07,759
I think that's a great idea, don't you?

941
01:20:07,828 --> 01:20:11,229
It's a pretty place if you just ignore
the smell from all the bombs.

942
01:20:11,298 --> 01:20:15,029
Armitage, you know I hate it
when you talk like shit that way.

943
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:17,468
So what?

944
01:20:17,537 --> 01:20:20,233
The whole planet hates your kind...

945
01:20:20,307 --> 01:20:22,502
without any damn reason at all.

946
01:20:22,576 --> 01:20:25,943
- Just like I did.
- I know they do.

947
01:20:26,012 --> 01:20:28,242
But if...

948
01:20:28,315 --> 01:20:30,249
There's someone else...

949
01:20:33,987 --> 01:20:36,922
Ross, I love you so very much.

950
01:20:43,697 --> 01:20:46,393
Hey, go wherever you want,

951
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:48,491
but you're never gonna lose me now.

952
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:05,984
Thank you for coming, sir.

953
01:21:06,052 --> 01:21:09,613
This is an MFN special news break.

954
01:21:09,689 --> 01:21:12,569
Chairwoman Everhart's car has just
turned onto the main thoroughfare...

955
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:14,523
in downtown St. Lowel.

956
01:21:14,594 --> 01:21:17,427
Her bright smile of success
is met with the cheers...

957
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:19,362
of thousands of admirers
lining the streets.

958
01:21:19,433 --> 01:21:23,665
The humanity of Mars is now whole again:
One world, one nation.

959
01:21:23,737 --> 01:21:25,932
One world, one nation.

960
01:21:58,605 --> 01:22:00,539
Two thousand.

961
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:17,317
- Look what Dad gave me.
- What?

962
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:20,223
It's a little too angelic for my taste,

963
01:22:20,293 --> 01:22:23,194
but now I've got some real power.

964
01:22:23,263 --> 01:22:26,255
We'll need it.

965
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:28,699
Let's show 'em.

966
01:25:50,637 --> 01:25:53,572
Look at all the space we've got out here.

967
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,541
Room as far as the eye can see.

968
01:25:56,609 --> 01:26:00,636
I grew up in a small house,

969
01:26:00,714 --> 01:26:04,150
which was hard with a lot
of brothers and sisters.

970
01:26:04,217 --> 01:26:08,483
It was always a battle to find
some small corner to call your own.

971
01:26:08,555 --> 01:26:12,719
When I became a man, I thought I'd live
in some wide-open place like Arizona.

972
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:16,193
But as I grew older, I realized
that I belonged in the city,

973
01:26:16,262 --> 01:26:18,753
surrounded by the buildings
and the bustle of people.

974
01:26:18,832 --> 01:26:21,824
A place like this
is too spacious for my taste.

975
01:26:21,901 --> 01:26:24,369
So long as I've got the right partner,

976
01:26:24,437 --> 01:26:26,803
that's where I'll make my home.

977
01:26:26,873 --> 01:26:29,899
I won't care who my neighbors are,
whether they're Martian or robots.

978
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:33,776
A place we can claim for our own.

979
01:26:37,617 --> 01:26:41,383
Do you suppose there is such a place?

980
01:26:41,454 --> 01:26:43,388
If we can't find it, then, by God,

981
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:45,651
we'll create a place
just for the two of us.

982
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:50,122
Do you think there's room for three?

983
01:26:50,196 --> 01:26:53,359
You're kidding.

984
01:26:53,433 --> 01:26:56,368
Well, when that happens,

985
01:26:56,436 --> 01:26:59,371
I guess I'll just
have to think of something.

986
01:27:00,305 --> 01:28:00,595
