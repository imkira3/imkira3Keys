00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:36,570
<i>What if this was your house?
Power's out. Lights are dead.</i>

3
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,843
<i>Your little ones in their bunk bed
down the hall, crying out...</i>

4
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,249
Mommy! Daddy! Come quick! I'm scared!

5
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:43,480
<i>- You need to get there, and fast.
- Coming, honey! Daddy's coming!</i>

6
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:46,023
<i>You'll need a weapon.
But first, you'll need a flashlight.</i>

7
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:48,053
<i>But you're in the dark!
What are you gonna do?</i>

8
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,094
<i>How are you gonna find it?
I'll tell you how.</i>

9
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:51,890
The Glow-in-the-Dark Flashlight!

10
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:55,599
That's right, folks!
I'm Larry Daley of Daley Devices,

11
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,895
and we're gonna spend
the next paid-programing block

12
00:03:58,003 --> 00:03:59,265
rocking your world.

13
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:03,273
And I brought along a friend to do it.
George Foreman, ladies and gentlemen!

14
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,168
Fantastic, Larry, fantastic!
Isn't he fantastic, America?

15
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:16,582
But, seriously, isn't it true
that just two years ago,

16
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:19,282
you were working as a night guard
at some dusty museum?

17
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,121
That is true, two-time world
heavyweight champ George Foreman.

18
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,422
I was just a regular Joe
with a flashlight and a dream.

19
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:28,523
You mean a regular Larry.

20
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:41,209
But what's no joke is
you're CEO of Daley Devices,

21
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,047
creator of such indispensable items
as the Super Big Dog Bone!

22
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:50,178
- You like that one?
- The Unlosable Key Ring!

23
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:51,882
Oh, yeah, that little chestnut!

24
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:56,018
And now your latest breakthrough...
Say it with me, America!

25
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,859
The Glow-in-the-Dark Flashlight!

26
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,334
Whatever the household crisis,
this is Daley Devices. Can I help you?

27
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,871
Tina, give this back to Stewart.
I don't trust his math, okay?

28
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,531
- That guy called again.
- Again?

29
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:12,600
Lar! Huge news!
We got the Wal-Mart meeting.

30
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:15,306
- No! When?
- Yeah. Three days.

31
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,473
Okay, all right.
We got a lot of work to do.

32
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:20,881
Well, okay, did you just hear me
say "Wal" and "Mart" together?

33
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:22,451
Yeah! I know, it's huge.

34
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,556
So just take a second
to be happy about it.

35
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:25,988
All right.

36
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:27,790
You're totally making fun of me.

37
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:30,054
No, let's hold off on the victory parade
till we close, okay?

38
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:31,829
You got it.

39
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,665
- And when does he want to meet?
- They want Friday morning, 10:00 a. m.

40
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:36,495
Okay, then, you know what?
Cancel that pitch

41
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:38,763
for the electric saw thing
with the propeller, all right?

42
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,168
- I just want to focus on this.
- Okay.

43
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:41,967
- Just this.
- My daughter's birthday, canceled!

44
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,416
You can go home.
I'm gonna be pretty late, okay.

45
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:59,081
Okay, boss.

46
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:16,668
Hello! Excuse me!
Unauthorized personnel!

47
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:20,470
If it isn't our very own
Mr. Success Story.

48
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:23,514
Come for one of your nostalgia tours?
I haven't seen you for a few months.

49
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,579
Yeah, I've been busy.
What's going on here?

50
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:30,751
Progress, so they tell me.

51
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:37,195
The future.
Behold, Natural History, version 2.0.

52
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,902
<i>Welcome to The Museum of Natural
History, where history comes to life!</i>

53
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:48,802
<i>Step up, ask your question.</i>

54
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,307
<i>Then let the next little boy or girl
have their turn.</i>

55
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:56,346
Okay, where were you born?

56
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:58,773
<i>Right here in New York City,
on Twentieth Street.</i>

57
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:02,353
<i>October 27th,
the year of our Lord 1858.</i>

58
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:08,486
Blah, blah, blah.
History, history. Learning, learning.

59
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:10,785
Changing America, one child at a time.

60
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,129
That's great. So you're adding
some new interactive exhibits?

61
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,095
No, Mr. Daley, not adding.
Replacing the old exhibits.

62
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,766
- Where are they going?
- Away.

63
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,638
We're getting rid of all this junk.
The dioramas, the waxworks,

64
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,441
even some of the shabbier animals,
like this scrawny little monkey.

65
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,313
You should be careful. He's a capuchin.

66
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,273
It's a monkey.

67
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,287
He's a rare breed. He's a capuchin.
He's not just a monkey.

68
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,590
"Monkey", then. I said "monkey".
Why be specific?

69
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:41,819
When you're throwing away a monkey,
you don't need the Latin name.

70
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:43,460
Are you throwing him away
or are you moving him?

71
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:47,755
What are you, the Primate
Garbage Police? Let it go, baby.

72
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,158
- Whose idea was this?
- Me, of course.

73
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,100
I'm in charge. Me and the board.

74
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,566
Mainly the board.

75
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,869
Anyway, why do you care?

76
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,873
No, it's just that people
love this stuff.

77
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,008
People, Mr. Daley, love "What's next?"

78
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:04,473
You should know that. You left.

79
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:06,574
My situation changed.
My business took off...

80
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,314
Yeah, you became a success.
So would I, if I was a night guard.

81
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,622
So where are these guys going?

82
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:15,191
Deep storage. Federal Archives.

83
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:18,292
- Where's that?
- Washington, D.C.

84
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,396
The Smithsonian.

85
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,131
There's got to be something
that we can do.

86
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,070
It's done!
They leave tomorrow morning. It's over.

87
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,805
Hey, buddy, how you doing?
How you doing with all this?

88
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,512
You want what's in here?

89
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:15,485
You think I got something for you?
You think I got a little rope?

90
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,351
Think you're stronger than me, huh?

91
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:20,013
Is that all you got, huh?

92
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:40,674
Lawrence! Good to see you, lad!

93
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,213
Yeah, you too, Teddy.

94
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:44,345
The Guardian of Brooklyn has returned!

95
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:47,652
Hey, Ahk. Look, McPhee told me
what's going on around here.

96
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,118
- I had no idea.
- Indeed.

97
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:52,987
A lot has transpired, Lawrence, since
your last visit. One would say that...

98
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,424
- Just...
- Cricket.

99
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:01,229
Hey, Bocephus! Little help over here!

100
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,169
Hey.

101
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,933
Hey, fellas. How you doing?

102
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,541
Well, lookee here.

103
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,101
If it ain't
Mr. Big-in-the-Britches himself,

104
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,579
come back just in time to see us off!

105
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:19,082
Yeah, Jed, I heard. Look,
I don't even know how this happened.

106
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:23,779
Yeah. Yeah, real mystery
how this happened.

107
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,325
Maybe the answer's on that magic
buzzing box there in your hand!

108
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,660
You weren't here, Gigantor!
That's how it happened!

109
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:32,060
Ain't no mystery!

110
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:35,089
The fact is, Larry, there's no one else
here to speak on our behalf

111
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,395
during business hours.

112
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:38,766
None, none, dum-dum.

113
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:43,404
Hey, guys! It's okay!

114
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,875
I'll call the board in the morning,
all right? I got some pull now.

115
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:47,878
I'll handle this.
We're gonna be okay here.

116
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:50,312
"We"? Did you hear that?
You hear Daydream Johnny?

117
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,274
There ain't been a "we" ever since
you put us on the "pay no mind" list.

118
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,650
And that's a cold place to be, boy.

119
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:58,950
Larry, what's done is done.

120
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,761
Even the glory of Rome
had to come to an end.

121
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:08,093
Would you please not look dramatically
off into the middle distance

122
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,758
when you say that?
It makes me feel worse.

123
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,931
I don't know what you're talking about.

124
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:15,128
Where are you looking?
Where are you looking? I'm over here.

125
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,672
Just a bit of wall.

126
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,437
Look, guys, maybe it won't be so bad.

127
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:24,542
Yes, you make a good point.

128
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:26,880
But this is the Smithsonian
we're talking about here.

129
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,445
Dexter, you don't know that.

130
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:34,190
You're missing the point, Gigantor!
They're shipping us out!

131
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,620
Larry, I know you're trying
to make us feel better.

132
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,590
I can see that you're genuinely
slightly bothered,

133
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:41,759
but it's never going to be the same.

134
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,367
All of us here, together,
in this place.

135
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:46,937
It ain't never gonna be home, boy.

136
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:53,472
Jedediah, please! Lawrence, these
are emotional times for all of us.

137
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,374
But it is our last night as a family,

138
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:59,280
and I don't want to see it squandered
in self-pity.

139
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:05,079
So who will join me for one final stroll
through these hallowed halls?

140
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:09,726
- Do you want to go for a walk?
- No.

141
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:13,289
I'm just gonna
squander it in self-pity.

142
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:15,459
My dear, shall we?

143
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:45,820
Safe journey, my love.

144
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:51,729
Hey, Dexter, want some help there?

145
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,741
Hey, come on, man.
No hard feelings, all right?

146
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,677
It's gonna be fine.

147
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,013
It's almost dawn, Lawrence.

148
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:09,742
Yeah. So, where's your crate, Teddy?

149
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:11,685
I won't be making this journey,
Lawrence.

150
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:15,419
It seems myself, Rexy,
and a few of the signature exhibits

151
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:18,087
will be staying here for now.

152
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,397
Without the tablet?

153
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,094
In truth, Lawrence,

154
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:31,208
Ahkmenrah's tablet
will be remaining here with him.

155
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:33,969
What?

156
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,775
They're going without
the tablet, my friend.

157
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:39,281
I'm afraid this night is their last.

158
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,148
You didn't tell them.

159
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:47,384
Sometimes it's more noble to tell a
small lie than deliver a painful truth.

160
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,798
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I shall do my best.

161
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:09,738
And who knows?

162
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:13,682
Sometimes the greatest change
brings about even greater opportunity.

163
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:15,278
Look at you, Lawrence.

164
00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:19,084
You left this place
and created quite a life for yourself.

165
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,518
Yeah, I guess so.

166
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:26,123
I should hope
you'd do more than guess, my friend.

167
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:29,689
You're a captain of industry.
The world at your fingertips.

168
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,360
It seems to me
you have everything you wanted.

169
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,595
Yeah, no, I know.

170
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:37,197
No, you don't. If I may, lad,

171
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:40,300
allow me to offer you
one piece of advice.

172
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:44,847
The key to happiness,
to true happiness, is...

173
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:48,846
Hang on one sec. I just gotta...

174
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,118
I got this Japanese deal.

175
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,524
No, okay, I'm turning this off.
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,686
The key to happiness?

177
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:11,532
I'll see you, Teddy.

178
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:41,235
So they're gone?
There's nothing you can do?

179
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,569
I wish there was, man.
I'm telling you, I tried everything.

180
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:48,112
I talked to McPhee, I called the board,
but they shipped them out this morning.

181
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,737
This is a lot of food, Dad.

182
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,442
Yeah. Ed from work's gonna come by.
I thought I told you.

183
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,711
We just have to go over
a couple of little work things.

184
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:58,119
- So you're working tonight.
- I used to work every night, remember?

185
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:00,850
That was when you had
the coolest job in the world.

186
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:04,459
<i>Yeah, well, "cool" doesn't pay
for your Guitar God VI or whatever.</i>

187
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,865
<i>- Hello?
- Gigantor! It's me, Jedediah!</i>

188
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:10,423
<i>- Hold! Hold!
- Jed?</i>

189
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:11,900
<i>Never surrender!</i>

190
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,302
Jed, what are you...
How did you dial the phone?

191
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:16,873
Long story! That brazen little monkey
stole the tablet,

192
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:19,068
and now we're in a world of hurt, boy!

193
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,305
- What's going on?
- Kahmunrah!

194
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:24,279
- Kahmunrah?
- Ahkmenrah's big brother! He's here!

195
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:26,441
- And trust me, not a friendly!
- Never!

196
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,246
I repeat, not a friendly!

197
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:30,287
<i>- Is that Attila, Jed?
- I don't know how much longer</i>

198
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:31,787
<i>- we can fight them off! No!
- Jed? Are you okay?</i>

199
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,289
<i>- Let go of me! Help!
- Hey, Jed.</i>

200
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:35,325
<i>- Let go! No, you let go of me! Help!
- Jed?</i>

201
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:39,119
What was that about?

202
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:45,727
I don't know.

203
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,103
Here, come on.
Gonna drop you off at your mom's.

204
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,836
- What's going on, Dad?
- I'm gonna go find out.

205
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:56,643
Okay, buddy, McPhee said the
Federal Archives are in the Smithsonian.

206
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:58,181
Where exactly am I going?

207
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:02,481
That's the thing, Dad. The Smithsonian
is actually 19 different museums.

208
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,282
They're laid out
around the National Mall,

209
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:06,983
from the Capitol
to the Lincoln Memorial.

210
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:10,185
They got everything there.
There's actually some really cool stuff.

211
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,492
Nicky, please focus.
Which museum are the Archives in?

212
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:17,159
Not in, under. It looks like it runs
underneath the entire Smithsonian.

213
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:19,469
So if Ahkmenrah's tablet is
down there...

214
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:22,028
The biggest museum in the world
is coming alive.

215
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:23,772
<i>What is exactly is your plan here, Dad?</i>

216
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,174
- Don't worry about it.
- You have no plan, do you?

217
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:29,480
Now, Nicholas, I have a very good,
highly thought-out plan.

218
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,944
- You have no plan.
- Yes, I have no plan.

219
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:33,381
I'll call you when I'm in.

220
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,024
Here you go. Thanks.

221
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:03,340
Welcome to the biggest museum
in the world.

222
00:18:03,414 --> 00:18:05,382
I know, right? It's a trip.

223
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:08,577
How about these planes dangling
from the ceilings, huh? Pretty weird.

224
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:11,382
Hi, excuse me. Could you tell me
how to get to the Federal Archives?

225
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:15,653
Of course. Just be a historical document
worthy of storing for all eternity.

226
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:19,057
I'm kidding. He's not a document.

227
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:23,431
I'm sorry, sir, the Archives are
underground, and they're a secure area.

228
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:27,199
Really? Like, totally secure?
Okay, thank you.

229
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:13,913
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the museum will be closing in one hour.</i>

230
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,326
Kahmunrah.

231
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,235
Hey! What are you doing?

232
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,772
- No touching.
- No, I wasn't gonna touch it.

233
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,835
You're moving in with some I.T.T., bro.

234
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:17,073
- I.T.T.?
- That's "Intent to Touch", homey.

235
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:19,246
No, I wasn't.
You're not allowed to go over the...

236
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:21,683
- What, are you gonna kiss it?
- All right, sorry.

237
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:23,981
Put your hand on it and touch it.
'Cause I stand there

238
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:26,750
and I wait all day
for a little girl like you to come in

239
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:29,952
and put her precious nail-polished nails
all over the exhibits.

240
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,826
Sorry. Last time I checked, I thought
we lived in a free country, so...

241
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,988
- No, we don't.
- No?

242
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,464
It's the United States of Don't Touch
That Thing Right in Front of You.

243
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,161
I just want to...
I'm allowed to look at it here, okay?

244
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:39,668
See what happens when you touch it!

245
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,035
So you're threatening me?
You're threatening me, Brandon?

246
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,040
- It's "Brundon. "
- Excuse me?

247
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,609
- "Brundon"!
- "Brundon"?

248
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:47,376
- "Brundon. "
- "Brundon. "

249
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:50,140
What, did they run out of U's
on your nameplate maker?

250
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:51,545
I don't know, did they run out of jokes

251
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,480
at the interesting-joke store
that you shop at?

252
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:55,781
Sorry, it looks like "Brandon", but...

253
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:57,844
I'm not here to be your
speech therapist. It's "Brundon"!

254
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:59,547
- "Brundon. " Okay...
- You never heard of the name before?

255
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:00,954
"Brundon"? No.

256
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:04,324
Look up most popular baby names
in 1984. "Brundon. "

257
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:07,023
Okay. Are you threatening me, Brundon?

258
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:09,462
I don't know, Princess Jasmine. Am I?

259
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,999
- Oh, wow. Lunabeam nine-volt.
- Yeah.

260
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,367
Wonderful piece of hardware, huh?

261
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:15,166
- That's their title, Lunabeam Nine.
- Great.

262
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,707
I prefer the Maglite LED myself,
but that's just me.

263
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,709
- Do me a huge favor.
- What?

264
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,804
Shove your hands into your pockets,
put your attitude way down,

265
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:25,678
and, also, be nice to people.

266
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:28,314
Great. But could I just ask you
one thing?

267
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,149
- Yeah.
- Okay, so just to be clear,

268
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:33,418
- so, I can't do this, right?
- Okay, that's actually crazy.

269
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:35,219
Did you just make a decision
to possibly end your life

270
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,317
earlier than you were expecting?

271
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:37,691
I'm gonna hit you with the flashlight.

272
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,753
- Now you are threatening me. Okay.
- Do not touch it!

273
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,422
- Don't touch me.
- Do not touch it!

274
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:42,829
- Do not touch it!
- Don't touch me!

275
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,197
I'll touch you with my flashlight
all day.

276
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:45,826
No, your flashlight
is meant to illuminate.

277
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:48,394
I will literally rent a camper,

278
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:50,997
and we will drive across America
with my flashlight on your chest.

279
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:53,009
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what?

280
00:21:53,344 --> 00:21:54,743
Want to see what happens
when I do it one more time?

281
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,780
- Let's see what happens.
- Watch you do nothing.

282
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:58,678
Let's watch you do nothing
when I do this.

283
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:01,845
Seriously, Brandon...

284
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,114
- Brundon.
- Brundon,

285
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,951
you do not know who you're dealing with.

286
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:08,548
You think you know what it means
to be a guard, huh?

287
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:10,753
Trust me, you don't know
the meaning of the word.

288
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:13,893
I have seen things
that you could not imagine.

289
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:16,762
- Like what kind of stuff?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

290
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,597
- But you're gonna drop the flashlight...
- The way you said it,

291
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,568
it sounded like you were gonna say
something cool.

292
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:22,629
Yeah, well, you don't get to hear it.

293
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,230
Drop the flashlight.

294
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,383
We cool?

295
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,985
That's actually pretty cool,
what you just did.

296
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:38,419
Thank you.

297
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:40,286
No hard feelings?

298
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:43,087
- All right? Sorry.
- Okay.

299
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,152
- I'm sorry.
- No, It's my fault. I shouldn't have...

300
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,288
No. It takes two opposing forces
to cause friction, and...

301
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:48,990
And you're just doing your job,
all right.

302
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,933
- Take it easy, man.
- Yeah!

303
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:54,836
That guy's great.

304
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:42,679
- Okay, buddy, I'm in.
- Great. Where are you?

305
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:45,583
<i>The northeast corridor of the Castle,
just off the Commons.</i>

306
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:47,851
<i>- I need you to talk me to the Archives.
- Okay.</i>

307
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,651
At the end of the hall, turn right,

308
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:51,661
and there should be a stairwell
coming up on your left.

309
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,730
- Got it.
- Now, it's kind of a maze down there.

310
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:57,528
Those underground tunnels
connect a bunch of different buildings.

311
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:59,193
<i>- It could get complicated.
- We'd better hurry,</i>

312
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:01,203
we only got 28 minutes till sundown.

313
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:04,399
<i>When you get down to B level,
you want to take another left...</i>

314
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:07,636
<i>- Nick? Hello? Nick?
- Dad! Can you hear...</i>

315
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,145
Nick, you're... Nick!

316
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,600
<i>- ID, Brundon.
- Hey.</i>

317
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:42,712
<i>- Later, dude.
- All right. Yeah.</i>

318
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,024
All right. Where are you guys?

319
00:26:27,318 --> 00:26:29,149
Oh, my God.

320
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:05,253
You little troublemaker.
I'm gonna deal with you later.

321
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:46,825
No. No! No, no, no!

322
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:07,145
No, English. English, perhaps.

323
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:10,018
I'm sorry, who are you?

324
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:15,987
I am Kahmunrah,
the great king of the great kings,

325
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:19,460
and from the darkest depths
of ancient history,

326
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,432
I have come back to life!

327
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:30,398
Perhaps you did not hear
what I just said.

328
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:35,969
I am a centuries-old Egyptian Pharaoh.
I was dead,

329
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:40,483
but now I have come back to life!

330
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:44,187
Yeah, no. I heard that.
I got that. Welcome back.

331
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:52,685
- Who are you?
- Larry Daley. Daley Devices?

332
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:56,892
It's up in New York. It's funny,
I know your brother, Ahkmenrah.

333
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,298
- Do you?
- Yeah.

334
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:02,066
He knows baby brother.
The favorite son.

335
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:04,663
- Yeah, good kid.
- Isn't he just?

336
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,840
You know, Mother and Father always
gave him the best of everything,

337
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,143
and I do mean everything.
They even gave him the throne.

338
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:14,014
The throne which was rightfully mine!

339
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:17,479
- He never mentioned that.
- I'll just bet he didn't.

340
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:23,926
Well, now begins the era of Kahmunrah,
because I have come back to...

341
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,893
Never mind, just hand me the tablet.

342
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:28,191
- Don't give it to him, Gigantor!
- Keep him away!

343
00:29:28,265 --> 00:29:30,756
Silence! Silence in there, please!

344
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,005
- Don't make me come in there!
- No! I won't be muzzled!

345
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:38,299
Look, that tablet is more powerful

346
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:42,869
than you, Larry Daley of Daley Devices,
can possibly imagine.

347
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:47,049
Bringing things back to life
is just a parlor trick.

348
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:50,348
With it, I shall unlock
the Gate to the Underworld

349
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:54,050
and bring forth my army
from the Land of the Dead.

350
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:57,059
So, if it's not too much trouble...

351
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,964
...hand it over.

352
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:06,100
Okay, here you go.

353
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,197
Wise decision.

354
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:15,207
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I thought
you wanted the Cube, but...

355
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,239
The Cube?

356
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:24,352
The Cube of Rubik.

357
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:32,823
All right, what is
this Cube of Rubik, then?

358
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,867
The Cube. You know, the one
that turns all who oppose you to dust?

359
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,869
That one? Whatever. I thought...

360
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:42,962
It was my bad, 'cause...
You know what? By the way,

361
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,667
your brother didn't want
to mess with it, either.

362
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:46,106
Yeah, he wanted to play it safe, too.

363
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:49,202
Just, you sort of struck me
as a next-level sort of guy, so I was...

364
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:53,680
I am not my brother, Larry.

365
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:58,243
I will kill you and your friends
in the blink of an eye.

366
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,957
Now take me to this Cube of Rubik.

367
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,362
- Here it is.
- Open it.

368
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:39,852
Come back here!
Come back here with my tablet!

369
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,488
I still have your friends!

370
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:22,495
- Take the wheel!
- What?

371
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:26,098
I said, take the wheel! Oh, we're
in it now! I love it! I love it!

372
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,238
Just keep her straight,
I'll handle the rest.

373
00:32:28,312 --> 00:32:30,337
Now, charge!

374
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,248
- Okay, so what's the plan here?
- We're Americans! We don't plan, we do!

375
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:43,088
Now hold on!

376
00:32:53,437 --> 00:32:58,067
See that? Act first, think later!
Works every time!

377
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,507
You're in good hands!

378
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:03,340
General George A. Custer
of the Fighting U.S. 7th Cavalry,

379
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:05,074
at your service.

380
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:11,811
I'm good, I'm good! Fly, you fool!

381
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:23,697
What's the rumpus, ace?

382
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,132
Look, lady, could you
get out of the way?

383
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:27,796
Lady? Who are you calling lady?
The name is Amelia.

384
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:36,869
Amelia Earhart!
Perhaps you've heard of me?

385
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,744
Oh, right.
You're a famous pilot or whatever.

386
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,546
Pilot? I was the first woman
to fly the Atlantic!

387
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,245
First woman to receive the Flying Cross,

388
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:47,346
first woman to fly across the 48 states
in a gyroprop.

389
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:50,257
Now if you'd wipe that perhaps-permanent
look of alarm off your kisser,

390
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,558
I was wondering if you might be so kind
as to tell me exactly where I am.

391
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:57,031
You're in a museum.
Or, actually, under it.

392
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,898
And I'm in kind of a dangerous
situation right now,

393
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,438
so you might not want to be
anywhere near me.

394
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,910
- Wow, you're fast.
- What's your name, flyboy?

395
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:09,738
My name is Larry Daley.

396
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:12,715
Well, Larry Daley,
in case you weren't listening,

397
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:14,910
I'm not one to shy away from danger.

398
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:18,744
How about spears?
Are you one to shy away from spears?

399
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:23,615
Let's ankle, skipper!
Now we're gonna have some fun.

400
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:31,395
Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, bingo!

401
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,262
Like a Golden Fleece.

402
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:39,768
All right, troops,
when your enemies captured me,

403
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:42,004
they made themselves
my enemies as well.

404
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:45,475
Big mistake. Big mistake.

405
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:50,278
All right, here's the plan.

406
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:54,989
On the third bugle blast,
I shall loudly announce, "Attack!"

407
00:34:57,928 --> 00:35:03,195
At which point,
we will all jump out of this box

408
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,493
and attack.

409
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,978
Mind bomb. What do you think?

410
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:21,974
You, Sacaja...

411
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:23,280
That is not my name.

412
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:25,378
- Sacajamea.
- No.

413
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:27,719
- Sack-in-a-box.
- No.

414
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:30,554
- Cinco de Mayo.
- I know you are a famous general...

415
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,993
That's all right, that's all right.
I'm a person, just like you.

416
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,224
But won't yelling, "Attack!"
alert the enemy

417
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,823
that we are about to attack?

418
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:39,666
What?

419
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:50,078
Yeah, I guess so.

420
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:57,951
You're quite the popular fellow,
Mr. Daley.

421
00:35:58,021 --> 00:35:59,511
Why don't you just skedaddle?

422
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:01,557
I can't skedaddle.
My friends are being held down there.

423
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:04,354
I got to go get them.
I got to find another way down.

424
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,906
This is new.

425
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:26,272
Hey, it's all right.
I don't want to hurt you.

426
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:31,043
I don't think it's you
they're afraid of, Mr. Daley.

427
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:39,794
Trade you. Thanks.

428
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:43,730
Back off! Just back off!

429
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,562
I will fork you!

430
00:36:46,903 --> 00:36:48,393
How about you, huh?

431
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:52,936
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.

432
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:55,739
I spent two weeks spear-hunting
with a tribe in Micronesia.

433
00:36:57,647 --> 00:36:59,672
The Micronesians had
much slower reflexes.

434
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,717
Come on!

435
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,092
It's over! It's over! It's all over!

436
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:20,363
Well, this is one humdinger
of a hootenanny.

437
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,875
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

438
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:32,945
Wow, four bars in 1945.

439
00:37:33,016 --> 00:37:34,540
<i>- Hello?
- Dad, finally!</i>

440
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:36,278
I've been studying
these plans to the Archives.

441
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:37,952
Looks like once
you get down the stairwell...

442
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:39,989
Oh, I'm way past the stairwell, Nicky.

443
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,184
- So you found everyone?
- Sort of.

444
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:44,157
What is that flibberty-widget
you are talking to?

445
00:37:44,227 --> 00:37:46,195
- Who's that?
- It's Amelia Earhart.

446
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:47,957
You found Amelia Earhart?

447
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:49,191
I... Hey!

448
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:53,167
- Wait a minute!
- Buddy, what's your hurry?

449
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:56,467
- Didn't you hear? The war's over!
- Sorry. These guys are chasing me.

450
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,373
What? What am I looking at, Mardi Gras?

451
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:02,809
- What unit are you from?
- I'm from Brooklyn.

452
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:07,179
What? Are you serious?
I'm from Flatbush! Hey, fellas!

453
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:09,478
These so-and-so's are trying
to rough up my pal here

454
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,884
just 'cause he's from Brooklyn!

455
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:12,716
- Thank you!
- You got it! Fight!

456
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:18,150
Hey, mister! You forgot your...

457
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,428
What the heck is this thing?

458
00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:33,268
Excuse me. Mind if I get in here?

459
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,748
Any time you're done, Mr. Daley.

460
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,680
- Call me!
- Thank you for that.

461
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:44,879
So you're quite the smooth operator,
aren't you, Mr. Daley?

462
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:46,687
Quick!

463
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:56,423
- That actually worked.
- What's next?

464
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,967
Look, nothing personal, but I'm kind of
in the middle of something here

465
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:00,559
that's not really your fight.

466
00:39:00,637 --> 00:39:02,366
It's because I'm a woman, isn't it?

467
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:06,133
No, it's because I've got this ancient
raised-from-the-dead evil Pharaoh guy

468
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:09,269
who's willing to kill me and probably
anyone near me to get this tablet

469
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:10,607
so he can rule the world.

470
00:39:10,714 --> 00:39:12,739
So it is because I'm a woman!

471
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:14,113
- Look, I...
- No, you look, Mr. Daley!

472
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:16,617
If it weren't for me, you'd still be
lost in that monochromatic mayhem!

473
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,086
- Lost in what?
- Black and white photo, you boob!

474
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,317
Now listen, and listen good.
I can help you.

475
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:24,416
I want to help you, and not because
I like you, which so far I don't,

476
00:39:24,494 --> 00:39:28,089
but because I smell adventure,
and, damn it, I want in.

477
00:39:30,233 --> 00:39:32,667
Okay. Don't blame me
if something happens to you.

478
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:34,735
I should be so lucky.

479
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:40,299
I am Kahmunrah. I am half god,

480
00:39:40,677 --> 00:39:43,578
once removed on my mother's side,

481
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:48,175
rightful ruler of Egypt,
future ruler of...

482
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,744
Well, everything else.

483
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:53,914
Now, I have lost some men.

484
00:39:54,524 --> 00:39:59,587
So, I am in need of some new generals
to join me in my little plan

485
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,654
of conquering this world.

486
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:03,926
Ivan the Terrible.

487
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:08,033
Napoleon Bonaparte.

488
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:10,129
And young Al Capone.

489
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,265
Yeah.

490
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:17,143
Some of the most despicable,
most feared leaders in all of history.

491
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,313
Gentlemen,

492
00:40:20,116 --> 00:40:23,449
really, it's just fantastic
to meet you all.

493
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,010
- And us, too.
- And me, you.

494
00:40:25,455 --> 00:40:30,392
All I ask is your allegiance,
and in return, I offer you the world.

495
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,921
Literally. Are there any questions?

496
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:35,930
Yeah, I got one.
How come you're wearing a dress?

497
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:38,531
This is not a dress. This is a tunic.

498
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:42,027
It was the height of fashion
3,000 years ago, I assure you.

499
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:43,872
Are there any other questions?

500
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,671
<i>Da. This dress you're wearing,</i>

501
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:50,008
do we have to wear one of these, too?

502
00:40:51,414 --> 00:40:54,042
Were you not listening?
I just told Mr. Capone here

503
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:55,744
that this is not a dress.

504
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:59,515
It is, in fact, a tunic.
Very big difference.

505
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,381
Are there any other questions?

506
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:05,359
Any questions not about the dress?

507
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:07,460
Tunic?

508
00:41:08,131 --> 00:41:10,099
All right, then. Moonlight is wasting,

509
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,225
- and the time is short.
- Short?

510
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:15,600
Why do you look at me
when you say "short"?

511
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,069
Sorry. It slipped out.

512
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:25,209
<i>Da. If we are talking
about world domination,</i>

513
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,113
then of course, I am interested.

514
00:41:27,317 --> 00:41:30,980
But first I want to clarify something
so you know what you are getting.

515
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:34,657
People always say,
"Ivan the Terrible, he's so terrible.

516
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,454
"I'm so scared of Ivan. He's bad news. "

517
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,393
When in fact,
the correct translation is

518
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:43,324
"Ivan the Awesome".

519
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:46,061
Ivan the Awesome?

520
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,729
It's not really as catchy, is it?

521
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:51,672
I mean, "Ivan the Terrible",
that really pops.

522
00:41:51,941 --> 00:41:55,433
But I wasn't terrible. In fact,
I was quite an effective leader.

523
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:59,175
Duly noted. Now, I'd like to wrap up
the old meet-and-greet

524
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:01,614
by asking you gentlemen a question.

525
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,983
Are you with me?

526
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:05,911
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Oui.</i>

527
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:10,752
<i>- Da, but...
- Then bring Larry Daley of Daley Devices</i>

528
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:13,796
and the Golden Tablet of Ahkmenrah
to me!

529
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,430
We'll get you back down
to your chums, Mr. Daley.

530
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:22,096
You won't get lost
following Amelia Earhart.

531
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:24,672
Quick, get down.

532
00:42:28,144 --> 00:42:31,113
Well, well, Mr. Daley,
I quite like the way you're holding me.

533
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:35,273
No. Sorry, I wasn't trying to...

534
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,343
Oh, please,
stop beating your gums, Mr. Daley.

535
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,684
You haven't been able
to take your cheaters off my chassis

536
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:41,381
since the moment we met.

537
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:43,789
I literally didn't understand
one word of that.

538
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,025
Is it just me
or is there music in the air?

539
00:42:51,134 --> 00:42:55,662
<i>...my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever...</i>

540
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,572
You! Little flying angel things! Quiet!

541
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:01,200
They're cupids, Mr. Daley. Gods of love.

542
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:05,008
Great. Gods of love, would you shut up?
Please shut up. We're trying to hide.

543
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:08,945
<i>Yeah! More than a woman! Yeah!</i>

544
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:14,251
No, don't change the arrangement,
it's not about the arrangement. Quiet!

545
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:16,256
Kick the chorus, y'all!

546
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:17,986
<i>More than a woman</i>

547
00:43:18,328 --> 00:43:20,353
Yo, show me what you got,
night guard!

548
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,761
All right, come on. Let's go.

549
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,493
<i>More than a woman to me</i>

550
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,063
<i>More than a woman</i>

551
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,502
<i>She's more than a woman</i>

552
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:40,880
And so, the little tiny man who
could not be a smaller or shorter mouse

553
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,714
runs into the claws of the giant cat!

554
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,554
You're really hung up
on the height, aren't you?

555
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:48,454
- No, it's not about height, see...
- Yes, you are.

556
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,550
You're saying I'm a little mouse,
you're a giant cat.

557
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:53,619
- I am the giant cat.
- No offense, I just...

558
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,631
You're Napoleon.
There's a complex named after you.

559
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:58,826
You're famous for being little,
and it's true. Look.

560
00:43:58,935 --> 00:44:01,495
Oh, you naive American man-boy.

561
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:04,471
Look. Neither of us are gonna
be jamming anytime soon, right?

562
00:44:04,574 --> 00:44:06,906
So it's not like we should...
It's not even an issue.

563
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:11,504
It's not about height or something else.
It's a plan. It's a brilliant plan.

564
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:14,673
- So it was a plan.
- Snazzy maneuver, Emperor.

565
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,387
<i>Merci, mademoiselle.</i>

566
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:21,618
Now, if your boyfriend
would kindly come with me...

567
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:23,090
I'm not her boyfriend.

568
00:44:25,094 --> 00:44:26,789
- Not her boyfriend.
- No.

569
00:44:27,096 --> 00:44:28,586
Just friends?

570
00:44:31,134 --> 00:44:35,264
- Yeah, friends.
- Acquaintances. Friends.

571
00:44:37,707 --> 00:44:39,368
Were you guys, like, friends in college

572
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,944
and just afraid now
to both ruin your relationship

573
00:44:42,011 --> 00:44:44,377
by telling the other person
that you want to be more than friends,

574
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,005
that you like-like each other?

575
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:51,645
One more time?
I'm sorry. I didn't catch the...

576
00:44:52,555 --> 00:44:54,182
Were you guys, like, friends in college

577
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,121
and now both afraid
to ruin your relationship

578
00:44:56,192 --> 00:44:58,956
by telling the other person
that you want to be more than friends,

579
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:01,053
that you like-like each other?

580
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,563
- No.
- No?

581
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:08,728
I just love the nitty-gritty of
relationships. All us French do.

582
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:10,396
<i>- Great.
- Yes. Amour!</i>

583
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:11,735
- Now.
- Yeah?

584
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:14,139
- This way, or you die.
- Yes.

585
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:21,882
- Wait, I'm coming with you!
- No! Our fight is not with you.

586
00:45:25,688 --> 00:45:29,180
...so you gotta bet a second time.
- All right. Okay.

587
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,791
My hair is currency
in certain parts of Europe.

588
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,957
It's true.
Currency, like gold or paper money.

589
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,966
The Duomo was purchased
with just one locket.

590
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:41,434
Listen up, kemosabe.

591
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:45,372
This rodeo clown wouldn't know
a flapjack from a flyswatter.

592
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:47,739
Now, Gigantor's out there
risking his hide for us.

593
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,778
The least we can do
is give him some help.

594
00:45:49,879 --> 00:45:54,543
Some big help. But we can't very well do
that if we're stuck in here, now, can we?

595
00:45:55,618 --> 00:45:56,983
We need to escape.

596
00:45:58,087 --> 00:45:59,247
What's a flapjack?

597
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:01,756
It's like a biscuit or a scone.

598
00:46:01,824 --> 00:46:04,224
- Chest bump?
- Yeah.

599
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,058
Then deadly. Watch.

600
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:10,159
Guard your cards, okay? Now you bet.

601
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:12,826
Okay, now you got
to throw some cards down.

602
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,170
- Ready?
- Ready.

603
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:21,443
Say something. Say anything.
This is no fun. You're supposed to...

604
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,080
- Hey! What are you two doing out here?
- Octavius, go!

605
00:46:26,149 --> 00:46:29,277
- You, make a run for it, I'll hold them off!
- I will not leave you!

606
00:46:29,352 --> 00:46:32,617
Ain't no time for your Roman melodrama!
Now, get! Go!

607
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:34,579
Old Jedediah will be fine.

608
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:35,954
Now, you're in real trouble.

609
00:46:40,663 --> 00:46:43,291
Why, these aren't real rubies at all.

610
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:45,864
Ruby slippers indeed.

611
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:53,766
But, whoever you are, Archie Bunker,
you had one comfortable throne.

612
00:46:54,777 --> 00:46:56,108
Hey, boss.

613
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:59,444
Caught this one trying to escape
through a rust hole in the crate.

614
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:01,346
One of his little friends got away.

615
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:04,978
Oh, please.
What damage could they possibly do?

616
00:47:05,054 --> 00:47:08,990
Why, they're no bigger than
a little grain of couscous. Aren't you?

617
00:47:09,058 --> 00:47:11,288
You know, two words come to mind
when I hear you talk.

618
00:47:11,694 --> 00:47:13,821
"Delusional" and "weirdo".

619
00:47:14,397 --> 00:47:17,764
And if I had to say a third, "goofy".
Just goofy.

620
00:47:18,267 --> 00:47:21,759
Now you let old Jedediah out of here
or he's gonna get angry.

621
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:23,763
Well played, Jedediah!

622
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,571
I'm sorry, I can't take you seriously.
You're just adorable,

623
00:47:28,077 --> 00:47:30,272
even when you're threatening me.
It's hilarious.

624
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,510
Is it just me,
or are these guys unbelievably cute?

625
00:47:34,584 --> 00:47:35,710
Now hold it a second, now.

626
00:47:35,785 --> 00:47:38,515
Now, you have a right to keep me
as your captive, torture me, even,

627
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:41,022
but don't call me cute! I ain't cute!

628
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:46,118
Steady, my friend!
Just stay alive! I will find you!

629
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:53,395
Gigantor. No!

630
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:58,269
Hello, Mr. Daley. Nice to see you again.

631
00:47:59,709 --> 00:48:03,475
Now, if you don't mind,
I shall take that from you.

632
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,446
Thank you.

633
00:48:06,582 --> 00:48:11,042
Finally. Finally! After 3,000 years,

634
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:18,255
my evil army of the damned,
my beautiful, beautiful army,

635
00:48:18,327 --> 00:48:23,094
shall be unleashed!

636
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,232
I'm afraid that Mother
and Father may have

637
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:37,245
slightly changed the combination on me.

638
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,749
I guess this whole
unleashing-the-underworld thing

639
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:43,081
isn't really working out for you, huh?

640
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:46,349
It must be really frustrating,
'cause you've waited thousands of years

641
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,253
to come back from the dead
and everything,

642
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:51,691
and now you can't get it open.

643
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:55,659
Fear not, for I shall wait
a thousand more if I must.

644
00:48:55,765 --> 00:48:59,826
Good, 'cause in a few hours you'll be
standing here in a frustrated position,

645
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:03,531
frozen, and I'll walk out of here
with my buddies and that'll be that.

646
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:04,765
So, I got all night.

647
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:08,435
Really? All night? Well!

648
00:49:08,978 --> 00:49:10,468
He doesn't.

649
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:21,680
Open that cage.

650
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:24,851
- What are you doing?
- No touching! No touching!

651
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,394
Don't you manhandle me!

652
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:29,627
- Look, he's having a little tantrum.
- Jed?

653
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,993
Don't you squirm! Don't squirm.
It'll only be worse for you.

654
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,300
- Put him down!
- Don't be afraid.

655
00:49:36,372 --> 00:49:37,964
I shan't hurt you.

656
00:49:39,008 --> 00:49:40,373
I lied.

657
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:45,078
I don't think he has all night
at all, Mr. Daley.

658
00:49:45,648 --> 00:49:49,914
From the looks of things,
I'd say he has a little over an hour.

659
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:51,646
Take me out of here!

660
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:57,483
You were the guardian!
You know all about this tablet.

661
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,757
You're obviously much more clever
than the rest of us.

662
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:02,923
You may or may not
know the combination,

663
00:50:03,032 --> 00:50:06,297
but I am going to give you
exactly one hour to figure it out.

664
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:09,338
If you do not,
I shall kill your friends.

665
00:50:09,405 --> 00:50:13,364
And please don't think about escaping,
for I shall be watching you.

666
00:50:13,442 --> 00:50:15,239
Look, I don't even know how to begin

667
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:17,505
to decipher this thing,
all right? Really.

668
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,207
What a pity.

669
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:23,116
And your little cowboy friend seemed
like such a charming little fellow.

670
00:50:23,452 --> 00:50:29,357
Ah, well. Tick-tock, Mr. Daley.
Your hour has begun.

671
00:50:29,425 --> 00:50:34,226
Hey! You got this, partner.
I know you do.

672
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:44,601
You got this!

673
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,972
There you are! Are you all right?
I've been worried sick! Sick I tell you.

674
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:57,849
- No, I'm fine.
- So what's our next move, partner?

675
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,582
I don't know. I just got to get
this tablet translated.

676
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,650
Oh, great! This guy again.

677
00:51:03,726 --> 00:51:06,559
Look, buddy,
we don't want any trouble, all right?

678
00:51:17,673 --> 00:51:19,004
Look at that!

679
00:51:19,108 --> 00:51:22,635
I guess our sassy cephalopod was just a
fish who didn't like being out of water.

680
00:51:23,512 --> 00:51:25,480
He's not such a ballywagger after all.

681
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:31,851
Okay. Glad you're happy.

682
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,528
Hello? A little assistance?

683
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,358
- Hey, Teddy! Perfect!
- Yes!

684
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:47,595
Maybe you could help us.

685
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,262
I'd love to help you,
but first things first.

686
00:51:49,338 --> 00:51:51,670
My nose is so itchy,
it's driving me insane.

687
00:51:51,774 --> 00:51:55,039
I hate to ask, but, as you see,
I'm missing a few body parts.

688
00:51:55,144 --> 00:51:58,341
- Could you please give us a scratch?
- Yeah, sure.

689
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:02,341
Oh, yes! That's exquisite.
A little over there...

690
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:03,645
- Yes!
- More?

691
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,983
Oh, yes! Yes! Oh, that's...

692
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:09,214
Sweet rutabaga pie, that was divine.

693
00:52:09,725 --> 00:52:11,283
Theodore Roosevelt, at your service.

694
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:14,221
Twenty-sixth President
of the United States, Rough Rider,

695
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,356
founder of the national parks,
and a whole bunch of other stuff.

696
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:20,496
- Have we met?
- No, there's another Teddy.

697
00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:25,131
- We have one of you in New York.
- Really? What's he like, this other me?

698
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:28,469
He's pretty much the same,
except with...

699
00:52:28,544 --> 00:52:30,637
Except what? Say it.
Except with a body?

700
00:52:30,713 --> 00:52:33,147
- Yes. He has a body.
- Oh, dash it, the pain!

701
00:52:33,749 --> 00:52:35,580
- And a horse.
- Excuse me!

702
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:38,313
We really need someone to translate
what's written on this tablet.

703
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:41,918
- Do you read hieroglyphics?
- Yes, I do, missy.

704
00:52:42,024 --> 00:52:43,753
That's a simple one.

705
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:47,886
Bird. Man with spear.
Sideways fish. Beetle. Vase.

706
00:52:48,764 --> 00:52:50,595
Okay, and what does that mean?

707
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,760
It means, and this is
just a rough translation,

708
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:58,766
"A man with a spear trapped a bird
and a sideways fish in a vase.

709
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,771
"And there was also a beetle. "

710
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:07,816
- I don't think that's it.
- That's just one possible translation.

711
00:53:07,883 --> 00:53:09,407
Another possible translation is,

712
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:11,453
"You will find the combination you seek

713
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,354
"if you figure out the secret
at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb. "

714
00:53:15,758 --> 00:53:18,591
- Okay, and what does that mean?
- I don't know! What am I, the Sphinx?

715
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:20,891
"What's this? What's that?"
Why don't you ask New York Teddy?

716
00:53:20,963 --> 00:53:23,363
I'm sure he'd love to get his grabby
little fingers all over that thing!

717
00:53:23,432 --> 00:53:25,059
Probably let his horse lick it, too!

718
00:53:25,134 --> 00:53:27,534
Mr. Daley, we should be going
to the sculpture gallery.

719
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:29,764
I think there's someone there
who might have a better thought on this.

720
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:32,507
The fellow we're looking for
is just down here.

721
00:53:32,575 --> 00:53:35,908
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Hello, young lady.</i>

722
00:53:36,412 --> 00:53:39,472
Hey, excuse me.
Could we keep moving, please?

723
00:53:39,548 --> 00:53:42,608
We certainly could, but then
we might miss a rare opportunity.

724
00:53:42,718 --> 00:53:45,243
I mean, she is a Degas, Mr. Daley.

725
00:53:45,321 --> 00:53:47,482
Okay, it's just I got a little buddy
stuck in an hourglass,

726
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,319
I got a pitch meeting
at Wal-Mart in the morning...

727
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:52,792
- It would be great if we could...
- He's right here.

728
00:53:53,662 --> 00:53:55,323
I think he'll have a thought on this.

729
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:58,565
Mr. Thinker, we're sorry
to interrupt your contemplation,

730
00:53:58,634 --> 00:54:00,864
but we really need
to figure out the secret

731
00:54:00,936 --> 00:54:03,063
at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb.

732
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:06,302
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

733
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,301
I'm thinking.

734
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:14,683
- I'm thinking.
- It's not happening with him.

735
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:16,715
Oh, wow.

736
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:20,153
You've gotta be kidding me.
Check that out!

737
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:24,118
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey! Hey!

738
00:54:24,193 --> 00:54:25,854
Buddy! Over here! This is serious.

739
00:54:25,928 --> 00:54:27,759
Apparently, it's a matter
of life and death.

740
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:29,995
I'll tell you
what's a matter of life and death.

741
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:31,794
That beautiful lady over there.

742
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:35,325
Hey, baby! Check out the gun show
going on over here!

743
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,363
Firepower!

744
00:54:38,774 --> 00:54:40,833
He's certainly no Einstein.

745
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:43,776
- Biceps! Deltoids...
- Yeah.

746
00:54:43,846 --> 00:54:47,111
- Wait a minute. I saw a bunch of those.
- A bunch of whats?

747
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,980
- Little Einsteins.
- Where?

748
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:52,010
Over there, in Air and Space.

749
00:54:52,888 --> 00:54:54,617
I gotta get over there.

750
00:54:55,157 --> 00:54:56,283
What?

751
00:54:56,358 --> 00:54:59,850
- Nothing.
- Okay. Then why are you staring at me?

752
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:02,191
I don't wanna miss a moment.

753
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:04,630
All right, good, but we should
get going, 'cause we...

754
00:55:05,801 --> 00:55:08,269
- Why?
- You talk too much, ace.

755
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,708
I don't know why I did that, Mr. Daley.

756
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:17,904
I just feel as if I've been asleep
for a long time and now, suddenly,

757
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:19,542
I'm awake.

758
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:21,680
I can explain that...

759
00:55:22,551 --> 00:55:24,314
But really, I could. I really...

760
00:55:25,187 --> 00:55:26,745
Again, why?

761
00:55:31,994 --> 00:55:33,325
Great, you're back.

762
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:40,333
Okay. Yeah. Great.

763
00:55:40,402 --> 00:55:43,496
<i>Love theme from Titanic.
Good, but not really appropriate.</i>

764
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:50,073
You don't let yourself enjoy things
much, do you, Mr. Daley?

765
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:54,148
Okay, you know what?
It's not really the song choice.

766
00:55:54,216 --> 00:55:56,081
And by the way, you're a little pitchy.

767
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,246
Well, I thought you were amazing,
and you look wonderful.

768
00:56:00,923 --> 00:56:02,823
Could you just fly away, please?

769
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:05,422
And so the adventure continues.

770
00:56:08,397 --> 00:56:11,594
What did I tell you? Enough!

771
00:56:18,807 --> 00:56:24,074
You know, I do sort of feel
like a floating butterfly.

772
00:56:24,513 --> 00:56:27,004
You are crazier than a road lizard.

773
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:31,143
Mr. Egypt, these two here heard
that we're taking over the world

774
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:34,188
and they want in.
I don't know who they are,

775
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,657
but they're on exhibit here,
too, apparently.

776
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:40,688
I don't even know what they are.

777
00:56:40,796 --> 00:56:45,927
I'm sorry, but we're all full up
in our axis of evil today. Sorry.

778
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:49,164
Come on! But I'm bad! I'm bad!

779
00:56:49,271 --> 00:56:51,762
Hey, I could show you how bad I am!

780
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:54,870
Fear me!

781
00:56:56,979 --> 00:56:58,640
I'm sorry. I'm just not buying it.

782
00:56:58,714 --> 00:57:03,151
You don't seem very bad. You just seem
sort of vaguely grouchy to me.

783
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:05,452
Oh, boy.

784
00:57:07,156 --> 00:57:09,818
What are you doing?
What is that? What is this?

785
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:12,156
What does it mean? You've lost me.

786
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:15,891
Is that you breathing?
Because I can't hear myself think.

787
00:57:16,632 --> 00:57:19,658
Can I make one suggestion
to you, my friend? Just simplify.

788
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:22,169
There's just too much going on here.

789
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:26,732
You're evil, you're asthmatic, you're
a robot... And what is the cape for?

790
00:57:26,842 --> 00:57:29,402
Are we going to the opera?
I don't think so.

791
00:57:29,511 --> 00:57:31,638
Sorry! Goodbye.

792
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,238
<i>Attention!</i>

793
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,214
He's leaving with the tablet!

794
00:57:35,918 --> 00:57:37,476
Where?

795
00:57:38,821 --> 00:57:40,254
Give me that.

796
00:57:40,823 --> 00:57:44,850
He's not trying to figure out the...
He's trying to escape!

797
00:57:44,927 --> 00:57:48,988
Go. Go! All of you! Kill him!
And bring me that tablet.

798
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:52,758
Come on, people! Let's go!
Without that tablet, we've nothing!

799
00:57:52,868 --> 00:57:54,597
<i>Streltsy! Go!</i>

800
00:57:57,206 --> 00:58:00,607
Thought you could get away,
didn't you, Larry Daley?

801
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:10,609
Criminy, we're jimmy-jacked.

802
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:12,846
- Jimmy-jacked? Really?
- It's the way I speak.

803
00:58:12,921 --> 00:58:15,185
Yeah, I know, but that one
sounds made up, even for you.

804
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:19,353
"Oh, no, our path has been blocked
by bad people. " What's the fun in that?

805
00:58:19,528 --> 00:58:22,190
The point is, we're not getting into
the Air and Space right now.

806
00:58:22,264 --> 00:58:24,289
- You're right. We are jimmy-jacked.
- Jimmy-jacked.

807
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,132
Come on.

808
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:38,443
They say a good man rules this union.

809
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:41,380
I promised Jedediah I would bring help,

810
00:58:41,917 --> 00:58:43,885
and help I will bring.

811
00:58:47,923 --> 00:58:50,721
Charge!

812
00:59:03,739 --> 00:59:05,639
Misjudged the distance.

813
00:59:09,511 --> 00:59:10,944
Who's there?

814
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,446
Jupiter, protect me.

815
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:26,218
Remain very still.

816
00:59:26,962 --> 00:59:29,260
They can sense movement.

817
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:34,199
Apparently, they can also hear me
talking to myself.

818
00:59:36,672 --> 00:59:38,435
I'm not a nut.

819
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:41,701
No!

820
00:59:48,617 --> 00:59:50,676
We should be okay in here for a while.

821
00:59:55,724 --> 00:59:57,988
So, how long
have you guarded antiquities?

822
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,722
What? Oh, no,
I don't actually work at the...

823
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:02,626
I just thought
with the fancy getup and all...

824
01:00:03,332 --> 01:00:04,822
No, I borrowed this.

825
01:00:05,334 --> 01:00:09,862
I mean, I was a guard back in New York,
but that was a while ago.

826
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,904
So why did you leave?
Did you not enjoy it?

827
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:15,636
No, I loved it. I just...

828
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:18,578
Things sort of took off
in a different direction, so...

829
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,138
- So what do you do now?
- Well, I sort of...

830
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:25,883
Well, I sort of design products
and sell them.

831
01:00:26,321 --> 01:00:28,084
- You're an inventor!
- I am.

832
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:30,055
I am an inventor, yeah. I invent stuff.

833
01:00:30,325 --> 01:00:31,849
Like the rocket ship?

834
01:00:31,927 --> 01:00:33,588
- No.
- The sea plane.

835
01:00:33,695 --> 01:00:36,493
- The dirigible?
- No, not aircraft.

836
01:00:36,565 --> 01:00:39,363
Sort of like more
small-scale stuff, like...

837
01:00:39,701 --> 01:00:43,660
Well, the Glow-in-the-Dark
Flashlight, that was mine.

838
01:00:45,674 --> 01:00:47,369
So this new job, do you like it?

839
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:51,538
Yeah, I like it a lot.
It's exciting. It's...

840
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,446
- What?
- I'm just confused, is all.

841
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,746
If you're not excited by it,
why do you do it?

842
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:01,950
- I am excited by it. I just said...
- I know what you said, Mr. Daley,

843
01:01:02,057 --> 01:01:05,390
but what I see in front of me
is a man who's lost his moxie.

844
01:01:06,695 --> 01:01:08,856
I have not lost my...

845
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,029
I got my moxie.

846
01:01:11,366 --> 01:01:12,890
Do you know why I became a pilot?

847
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,437
- I don't, no.
- For the fun of it.

848
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:20,442
Why else would anyone do anything?

849
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,637
Great Gatsby!

850
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:30,710
Blast these pigeons
and their incessant cooing!

851
01:01:30,786 --> 01:01:33,721
- No! Mr. President! Sir!
- All right. Time to see the state...

852
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:37,054
- Please don't get up!
... of this great union! I always say,

853
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:40,822
leave nothing for tomorrow
which can be done today.

854
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:42,954
Sir, if you go out there,
you're gonna freak a lot of people out!

855
01:01:43,065 --> 01:01:46,831
Freak? I assure you, sir,
I am no freak.

856
01:01:46,935 --> 01:01:51,338
- No, I didn't mean you're a freak...
- Come here, little one.

857
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:55,472
In fact, if anyone is freakish,
I'm afraid it's you, sir.

858
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:58,811
The truth is, you are very small.

859
01:01:58,914 --> 01:02:01,610
And I mean
even for a regular-sized human.

860
01:02:01,683 --> 01:02:04,447
What? Why would you even say that?

861
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:06,914
I must be honest.

862
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:10,356
Right. Okay, Honest Abe.
Of course. I'm sorry. Great.

863
01:02:10,459 --> 01:02:12,757
Come, now, Mr. President,
put the little man down

864
01:02:12,828 --> 01:02:15,092
and let's sit our fanny back
in that throne of yours.

865
01:02:15,163 --> 01:02:18,655
You have a can-do attitude,
and I shall do as you ask.

866
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:20,359
Thank you.

867
01:02:20,669 --> 01:02:22,534
- There you go.
- Thank you.

868
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:27,041
It's that very can-do spirit that has
defined this remarkable nation of ours.

869
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:28,632
- Interesting story.
- They're coming.

870
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:30,007
One night in Gettysburg...

871
01:02:30,112 --> 01:02:31,841
Mr. President, we're gonna need you
to hold still now.

872
01:02:31,947 --> 01:02:33,676
- What?
- Abraham, freeze!

873
01:02:33,782 --> 01:02:35,545
Freeze? I...

874
01:02:42,824 --> 01:02:44,883
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

875
01:02:44,993 --> 01:02:47,484
- Come on, let's get to Air and Space.
- If I may,

876
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:50,999
- you two make an adorable couple.
- Oh, no, we're not...

877
01:02:51,066 --> 01:02:52,727
No, we're not a...
I mean, we're not a...

878
01:02:52,834 --> 01:02:56,031
"We're not a... I mean, we're not a... "

879
01:02:56,138 --> 01:02:57,662
I never lie!

880
01:02:58,006 --> 01:03:01,533
The truth is,
you two are adorable together.

881
01:03:01,643 --> 01:03:03,076
Thank you. Good night.

882
01:03:03,178 --> 01:03:08,639
Farewell, lovely lady
and small, little man.

883
01:03:10,085 --> 01:03:12,849
Now let's see if we can find
these Einsteins of yours.

884
01:03:30,305 --> 01:03:32,773
<i>One giant leap for a mannequin...</i>

885
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:38,469
<i>D.C., this is Air and Space. We are
back online and fully operational.</i>

886
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:47,646
The Tuskegee Airmen
are on the march once again.

887
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:51,716
Can you stop narrating everything
we're doing? Just live in the moment.

888
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:55,354
The Tuskegee Airmen
are living in the moment!

889
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,863
- Miss Earhart?
- Yes.

890
01:03:56,932 --> 01:03:59,093
- I wanna say thank you.
- What for, Captain?

891
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:01,465
A lot of people didn't think
we could fly, either.

892
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,731
Thanks for clearing the runway, ma'am.

893
01:04:07,242 --> 01:04:09,472
- Race you to Paris?
- You're on!

894
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:10,909
No! Not now! We gotta...

895
01:04:10,979 --> 01:04:13,243
- It's just a quick jaunt over the pond.
- No. Gotta find the Einsteins.

896
01:04:13,315 --> 01:04:16,409
Come on, we gotta go.
We don't have time. Come on!

897
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:18,817
Sorry, it's in the blood.

898
01:04:19,554 --> 01:04:21,146
There she is, Mr. Daley.

899
01:04:21,256 --> 01:04:24,885
Old Bessie, the old family bus.
That gal took me across the Atlantic!

900
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,928
Okay. I think the Einsteins
are over here, though.

901
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:29,691
<i>This is Mission Control.
Flight check complete.</i>

902
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,256
<i>- Where'd you go? Where'd they go?
- You are clear for launch.</i>

<i>D.C., this is Mission Control.</i>

905
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:39,665
<i>- No, no! No!
- All systems go and green for lift-off.</i>

906
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:42,243
<i>Roger that.
We are green for lift- off.</i>

907
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:45,074
No, we're definitely not green
for any kind of lift-off!

908
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:48,947
- I want a "go, no-go" for launch.
- I say no-go. Let's not go.

909
01:04:49,017 --> 01:04:50,109
Go!

910
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,153
Go!

911
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:54,912
- Go!
- No! No go!

912
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,185
<i>Torquing angles incoming.</i>

913
01:04:57,292 --> 01:04:59,351
Tone it down with the torque.
Torque it down.

914
01:04:59,461 --> 01:05:01,019
De-torque. De-torque.

915
01:05:02,931 --> 01:05:04,762
Commence ignition sequence.

916
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:07,358
- Roger that, flight.
- We have launch commit.

917
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:09,630
<i>- No. No, no, no!
- Ten,</i>

918
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,969
<i>nine, eight, seven...</i>

919
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,133
<i>- Hey, that's mine.
- No, we do not have commit.</i>

920
01:05:14,209 --> 01:05:17,144
<i>Repeat. We are decommissioning
the committal of the launch</i>

921
01:05:17,212 --> 01:05:22,878
<i>and it is now a negatory launch phase.
We are in a no-fly, no-go phase.</i>

922
01:05:22,984 --> 01:05:27,683
<i>That is a November-Gorgon phase
of non-flying!</i>

923
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:29,654
<i>- Fine!
- And we're gonna say good night.</i>

924
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:32,250
<i>Thank you. Good work. Over and out.</i>

925
01:05:33,628 --> 01:05:35,562
- Sorry.
- Damn, that was disappointing.

926
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,598
Come on. I'll buy you
a cup of coffee.

927
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:40,062
Hey, little space monkey.

928
01:05:43,071 --> 01:05:46,006
You're Able. Okay, good. How you doing?

929
01:05:46,641 --> 01:05:48,506
Yes, good. At ease. All right.

930
01:05:50,378 --> 01:05:52,744
You're a polite little fella,
aren't you?

931
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:55,976
Hey, you happen to know where those
little Einstein bobblehead guys are?

932
01:05:57,285 --> 01:05:59,753
Mr. Daley! I found your Einsteins.

933
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:01,684
Great. Hey...

934
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:05,386
Gentlemen, we're trying to crack
the combination of this tablet doodad,

935
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:07,985
and the writing here says we'll find it

936
01:06:08,063 --> 01:06:11,521
if we figure out the secret
at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb.

937
01:06:13,535 --> 01:06:16,368
That's an easy one.
The answer's in the question.

938
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:18,703
- What does that mean?
- "Figure out".

939
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:21,368
It's a figure! I.e., a number.

940
01:06:21,443 --> 01:06:24,276
And the Pharaoh's tomb,
i. e. the pyramids.

941
01:06:24,379 --> 01:06:26,939
Don't you get it, kid?
You're looking for the secret number

942
01:06:27,048 --> 01:06:28,913
at the heart of the pyramids.

943
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:31,715
<i>Well, whistle me Dixie, the answer's pi!</i>

944
01:06:32,053 --> 01:06:35,614
- Pi?
- 3.14159265, to be exact.

945
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:38,784
Yes! 3.1495265.

946
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:41,954
No, no, no, 3.14159265.

947
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:44,122
Yeah, okay, 3.14...

948
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,234
I'm sorry, I can't tell.
Is it yes or no? Cause you just...

949
01:06:47,302 --> 01:06:49,031
I know it's hard, could you just...

950
01:06:49,104 --> 01:06:50,435
Don't touch the hair.

951
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:54,100
<i>- Sorry, I can't tell if it's up or...
- I'm a bobblehead, dummkopf,</i>

952
01:06:54,209 --> 01:06:57,372
and that's the way we like it.
All together, now!

953
01:06:57,445 --> 01:07:01,472
<i>That's the way
We like it</i>

954
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:03,574
You know,
we can't all be Einsteins, so...

955
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:04,812
- I can!
- We are!

956
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,444
- He is!
- Me, too!

957
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:08,318
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, here it is.

958
01:07:08,423 --> 01:07:10,891
- Can you slow it down a little bit?
- Okay.

959
01:07:10,959 --> 01:07:14,122
3.14159265.

960
01:07:14,229 --> 01:07:16,720
- Okay. 3.14...
- I've got it.

961
01:07:17,332 --> 01:07:19,266
- Thank you, Mr. Einsteins.
- Thank you.

962
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:26,098
All right. Now, like the brilliant
and famous general that I am,

963
01:07:26,174 --> 01:07:28,267
I thought long and hard
about what you said,

964
01:07:28,343 --> 01:07:32,336
and I've come up with a brand-new
and improved battle plan!

965
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,148
Okay.

966
01:07:37,419 --> 01:07:41,412
I will loudly announce that we are not

967
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:44,356
going to attack, and then...

968
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,693
Wait for it.

969
01:07:46,795 --> 01:07:51,926
"What's the amazing Custer about to say
now? I hope he's my friend, or... "

970
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,091
We attack!

971
01:07:57,706 --> 01:08:01,301
Didn't expect your friend
to run off like that, did you?

972
01:08:01,676 --> 01:08:04,008
He's coming back, Ka-Ka-Ro.

973
01:08:04,112 --> 01:08:07,878
Sure as moon shines on a mongoose,
he'll be here.

974
01:08:08,149 --> 01:08:11,175
I would save my breath if I were you.

975
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:13,447
You don't have many left.

976
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:18,959
We've got about 10 minutes
to get over there to Jed.

977
01:08:19,027 --> 01:08:21,860
I think we make a good team,
perhaps more than a team.

978
01:08:21,963 --> 01:08:23,954
Wait. Okay, wait.

979
01:08:24,032 --> 01:08:25,727
What's the matter?
You didn't like kissing me?

980
01:08:25,834 --> 01:08:29,736
No, I did. It was great. I mean,
the slapping hurt a little bit, but...

981
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:34,207
- So you don't like me, then.
- Of course I like you. You're incredible.

982
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:36,641
I think you're an amazing person.
You're...

983
01:08:36,711 --> 01:08:40,647
It's just there are certain issues
that would prevent us from...

984
01:08:40,715 --> 01:08:44,981
- I just... You're not...
- I'm not what, Mr. Daley?

985
01:08:47,822 --> 01:08:50,814
Okay. You're made of...

986
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,525
Made of...

987
01:09:03,104 --> 01:09:06,733
Wonderful things.
You're made of good, wonderful things.

988
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:13,941
Come on.

989
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,752
Gentlemen, could you
buy us some time please?

990
01:09:27,095 --> 01:09:28,426
It'll have to do.

991
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:32,763
No! That's the first plane ever made!

992
01:09:32,867 --> 01:09:35,529
It's made out of balsa wood and paper.

993
01:09:35,603 --> 01:09:39,130
It's made out of spruce and canvas and
good old-fashioned American ingenuity.

994
01:09:40,275 --> 01:09:41,742
Are you coming, or what?

995
01:09:46,281 --> 01:09:49,717
- Out of our way!
- I don't think so.

996
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:52,784
They're getting away!

997
01:09:56,925 --> 01:10:00,088
Hang on, Mr. Daley.
Things are about to get interesting.

998
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:09,833
A lady pilot! Preposterous!

999
01:10:09,971 --> 01:10:13,236
- Think again, boys!
- Oh, she's good.

1000
01:10:30,992 --> 01:10:32,926
What? What?

1001
01:10:32,994 --> 01:10:35,155
One of the wires is jammed.
I'm going to have to loosen it.

1002
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:37,458
- Here, take the stick!
- No! I'm not gonna... No!

1003
01:10:37,532 --> 01:10:39,090
I know you've got moxie in you yet.

1004
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:42,762
Moxie doesn't fly planes! People
who have pilots' licenses fly planes!

1005
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:44,361
- Okay.
- She's all yours.

1006
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:48,771
I don't want it! I don't want the stick!

1007
01:10:52,647 --> 01:10:55,309
Don't look now, Mr. Daley,
but you're flying an airplane!

1008
01:11:06,861 --> 01:11:08,522
Able! The doors!

1009
01:11:24,879 --> 01:11:27,473
- Got it!
- Pull!

1010
01:11:30,718 --> 01:11:32,083
Pull up!

1011
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:39,319
Yes!

1012
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:41,089
Godspeed, Amelia Earhart!

1013
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:42,595
Godspeed.

1014
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:23,534
Look a little nervous there,
Ramen Noodle.

1015
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,800
'Cause for me,
this is like a spa treatment.

1016
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:30,405
Sand baths are really rejuvenating
for the skin. Exfoliates.

1017
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:32,545
Giving up yet?

1018
01:12:32,714 --> 01:12:34,545
Not quite yet, no.

1019
01:12:35,216 --> 01:12:39,346
In fact, let's see
if we can't make time fly.

1020
01:12:45,326 --> 01:12:46,987
What is that funny sound?

1021
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,342
Stop!

1022
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:13,919
Right there, please, Mr. Daley.

1023
01:13:14,422 --> 01:13:16,117
Well. Well, well, well!

1024
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:18,682
You certainly know how to make
an entrance, Mr. Daley.

1025
01:13:18,793 --> 01:13:20,192
Time to recruit some backup.

1026
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:22,763
I hope for your
little friend's sake, here,

1027
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:25,196
that you also figured out
the combination.

1028
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,824
- Give me Jed.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1029
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,665
First, give me the combination
and hand over that tablet.

1030
01:13:29,771 --> 01:13:31,363
I'll give you the tablet
and the combination

1031
01:13:31,472 --> 01:13:33,133
when you release my friends
and give him back to me.

1032
01:13:33,274 --> 01:13:37,108
I shall release what I want to release
the moment I want to release it.

1033
01:13:37,178 --> 01:13:38,805
Great. And I'll release
what I want to release

1034
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,609
at the exact moment
that I want to release it, okay?

1035
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,378
Tell me the combination
and give me that tablet right now

1036
01:13:43,484 --> 01:13:45,452
or I shall kill all of your friends,

1037
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,318
starting with the little
shaggy-headed little cowman here.

1038
01:13:48,389 --> 01:13:51,790
I ain't shaggy-headed!
Gigantor, let me take this guy!

1039
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:54,487
Don't worry, I got this handled.
You don't want to give me my friends,

1040
01:13:54,562 --> 01:13:56,462
then you're not gonna get
your combination or your tablet.

1041
01:13:56,531 --> 01:13:57,964
- All right, I'll tell you what.
- Good.

1042
01:13:58,032 --> 01:14:00,899
They didn't call me
Kahmunrah the Trustworthy for nothing.

1043
01:14:01,002 --> 01:14:03,664
Here you go. They didn't call me
Kahmunrah the Trustworthy!

1044
01:14:03,738 --> 01:14:05,672
They called me
Kahmunrah the Bloodthirsty,

1045
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:09,369
who kills whoever doesn't
give Kahmunrah exactly what he wants

1046
01:14:09,477 --> 01:14:11,775
in the moment that he wants it,
which is right now,

1047
01:14:11,846 --> 01:14:15,043
when I had also better get
the combination and the tablet!

1048
01:14:16,117 --> 01:14:18,642
- That's what they called you?
- It was shorter in Egyptian.

1049
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,449
Great, I'll give you
the combination after you give him back.

1050
01:14:20,521 --> 01:14:23,581
How dare you? If you touch that again,
I shall kill you right now.

1051
01:14:23,658 --> 01:14:25,285
- Okay.
- Do not touch this.

1052
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,227
- This is a no-touching zone!
- Good. Well, then...

1053
01:14:28,296 --> 01:14:32,323
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you reached across like that again!

1054
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,836
I can't even believe it!
Oh, God, I want to kill you right...

1055
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:39,634
If you didn't know this combination,
you'd be so dead right now,

1056
01:14:39,707 --> 01:14:42,699
- it would be unbelievable.
- Great, but I do know the combination.

1057
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:46,869
Don't cross this line with your hand!

1058
01:14:46,981 --> 01:14:52,886
How dare you! If you
speak again, I'm going to kill you.

1059
01:14:52,987 --> 01:14:54,477
Do you understand this?

1060
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:56,420
Don't say it!
Oh, God, I see you getting ready.

1061
01:14:56,524 --> 01:14:58,651
- I wasn't gonna say anything.
- Oh, my God, don't say anything.

1062
01:14:58,726 --> 01:15:00,853
I shall murder you if you talk again.

1063
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:06,059
Now give me that tablet
and tell me the combination.

1064
01:15:06,334 --> 01:15:08,996
Okay. After you give me Jed
and release my friends.

1065
01:15:09,871 --> 01:15:11,270
- You did all three!
- What?

1066
01:15:11,372 --> 01:15:13,272
You spoke
and you reached your hand across!

1067
01:15:13,374 --> 01:15:15,239
Look. I can talk to you about this
all night, okay?

1068
01:15:15,343 --> 01:15:16,708
- How about this?
- Look, just give...

1069
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:19,076
How about I don't kill you right now,
like I really, really want to,

1070
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,205
and I give you precisely five seconds

1071
01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:24,012
to give me that tablet
and tell me the combination?

1072
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:27,680
We already got the combination. It's pi.

1073
01:15:28,089 --> 01:15:32,788
- 3.14159265.
- No!

1074
01:15:32,894 --> 01:15:34,521
- Hey.
- Sorry.

1075
01:15:35,263 --> 01:15:41,293
So Crazy Hair here, he sang.
Oh, did he sing! Like a canary.

1076
01:15:42,036 --> 01:15:43,469
I'm sorry, Larry.

1077
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:46,062
Enough out of you!
Remember what happened last time?

1078
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:47,965
- That's enough.
- Stupid man.

1079
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:53,479
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

1080
01:15:53,581 --> 01:15:56,049
Must be a real bummer for you, Larry,

1081
01:15:56,984 --> 01:16:01,045
knowing that all of your valiant efforts
were, in the end, for naught.

1082
01:16:02,423 --> 01:16:06,120
What a terrible disappointment
you must be to yourself.

1083
01:16:15,803 --> 01:16:17,828
Do you hear that humming sound?

1084
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,465
Do you know what that sound is?

1085
01:16:23,578 --> 01:16:25,011
It's rhetorical.

1086
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:29,309
That is the sound of the End.

1087
01:16:37,158 --> 01:16:38,682
I'm sorry, Jed.

1088
01:16:39,794 --> 01:16:41,455
You did your best, Gigantor.

1089
01:16:42,096 --> 01:16:44,360
Dadgum it, we almost had him, too.

1090
01:16:44,465 --> 01:16:47,662
No, I mean, I'm sorry I wasn't around
the last couple of years at the museum.

1091
01:16:48,269 --> 01:16:52,205
- Maybe none of this would have happened.
- You don't get it, do you, Gigantor?

1092
01:16:52,306 --> 01:16:54,706
I didn't call you
'cause we needed your help.

1093
01:16:54,809 --> 01:16:56,470
Sure, we were in a little pickle,

1094
01:16:56,544 --> 01:16:58,034
but it wouldn't have been the first time

1095
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:00,774
I had to wrestle my way
out of a root sack.

1096
01:17:01,182 --> 01:17:04,618
No, partner.
I called you 'cause you needed us.

1097
01:17:05,453 --> 01:17:08,820
That fancy suit you've been parading
around in these past couple years,

1098
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,983
that there's a hanging suit.

1099
01:17:11,058 --> 01:17:13,959
All gussied up, but dead inside.

1100
01:17:14,562 --> 01:17:15,893
That ain't you.

1101
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:19,358
- And I'll tell you another thing.
- Yeah.

1102
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:21,128
This night ain't over yet.

1103
01:17:21,836 --> 01:17:24,999
This little Midnight Cowboy's
got some fight left in him.

1104
01:17:25,072 --> 01:17:28,235
Something tells me you do, too. Ho, now!

1105
01:17:57,238 --> 01:18:02,005
Welcome to the new,
extended reign of Kahmunrah,

1106
01:18:02,076 --> 01:18:03,873
Fifth King of Egypt

1107
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:06,709
and now the world!

1108
01:18:07,281 --> 01:18:10,682
Horus, Ra, my warriors, come forth!

1109
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:16,122
Send Larry Daley
and his friends to their doom!

1110
01:18:40,948 --> 01:18:42,575
Halt!

1111
01:18:43,584 --> 01:18:46,451
The mighty Octavius has returned!

1112
01:18:46,554 --> 01:18:51,958
I ride on the back of nature's
most fearsome creature! I ride

1113
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,259
the squirrel!

1114
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,926
Forward now, my mighty steed!

1115
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:08,140
Whoa, girl! Easy.

1116
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:10,403
Do you wish to surrender honorably?

1117
01:19:10,478 --> 01:19:13,743
Or must this end
with the spilling of your blood?

1118
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,545
This? This is your big rescue?

1119
01:19:19,453 --> 01:19:22,422
Oh, no. This is!

1120
01:19:33,834 --> 01:19:36,462
What is that thing?

1121
01:19:36,537 --> 01:19:38,664
The name is Abraham Lincoln.

1122
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:42,209
- And you, sir, are in a heap of trouble!
- Attack it!

1123
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:51,413
Disgusting half-pigeons!

1124
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:04,531
No, no, no! Hello?

1125
01:20:04,632 --> 01:20:06,964
<i>Adiós, bird brains!</i>

1126
01:20:07,034 --> 01:20:08,729
Wait, wait, wait. No, no!

1127
01:20:08,836 --> 01:20:10,827
Goodbye, strange birdmen.

1128
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,906
Do not return to the Underworld!

1129
01:20:13,007 --> 01:20:14,998
Yes, yes, do go back
into the Underworld!

1130
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:16,634
Thank you for coming! Good night!

1131
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:17,769
No, no!

1132
01:20:26,387 --> 01:20:29,481
Oh, this is awkward.

1133
01:20:29,824 --> 01:20:32,588
It appears my work here is done.

1134
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:38,655
Just remember, son, a house divided
against itself cannot stand.

1135
01:20:41,435 --> 01:20:42,459
Farewell.

1136
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:47,197
- What now?
- You know, I'm not quite sure.

1137
01:20:48,409 --> 01:20:52,004
I suppose we should probably start
by watching him die.

1138
01:20:53,214 --> 01:20:56,513
<i>Streltsy! Make him dead!</i>

1139
01:20:59,553 --> 01:21:01,350
Now what?

1140
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:06,886
We are not going to attack right

1141
01:21:06,961 --> 01:21:10,089
now!

1142
01:21:18,906 --> 01:21:20,703
Get them!

1143
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:43,090
Fear not, Larry!
I will help Jedediah!

1144
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:44,825
You come at them from behind!

1145
01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:49,134
- Hey, what's going on?
- I'm hiding.

1146
01:21:49,236 --> 01:21:51,466
Hiding? What are you doing?
Come on, we need you.

1147
01:21:51,972 --> 01:21:55,601
- I'm a failure.
- No, you're not.

1148
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:58,440
Did you foolishly lead
208 Americans to their deaths

1149
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:00,241
at the Battle of Little Bighorn?

1150
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:05,886
- No.
- No? Not good. Not good at all.

1151
01:22:05,953 --> 01:22:08,387
- That's not good.
- Sure, I talk a good game,

1152
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,220
but the truth of the matter is,
I don't deserve these stars.

1153
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:16,060
I will always be famous
for my biggest failure.

1154
01:22:19,166 --> 01:22:20,258
Hey.

1155
01:22:20,634 --> 01:22:22,625
The past is the past, okay?

1156
01:22:23,337 --> 01:22:26,067
Right now, this moment, this night,

1157
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:29,441
this is what you're gonna be
remembered for.

1158
01:22:31,178 --> 01:22:32,839
This is your last stand.

1159
01:22:50,531 --> 01:22:53,022
- They need a leader.
- Yeah, they need a leader.

1160
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:57,199
Yeah? You want to be their leader, huh?

1161
01:22:58,272 --> 01:23:00,035
- Yeah, I do.
- Let's do this!

1162
01:23:00,674 --> 01:23:01,800
- All right?
- Yeah.

1163
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:03,241
Let's go!

1164
01:23:05,546 --> 01:23:06,945
Not good!

1165
01:23:07,448 --> 01:23:08,437
<i>Larry!</i>

1166
01:23:09,183 --> 01:23:10,275
Hey, Able!

1167
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:11,340
<i>I want to help!</i>

1168
01:23:11,485 --> 01:23:12,577
Oh, great.

1169
01:23:12,653 --> 01:23:14,348
<i>Who are you?
This is my museum!</i>

1170
01:23:14,722 --> 01:23:16,485
<i>Well, he's my human.
Back off!</i>

1171
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:18,248
<i>You need all the help you can get,
Jungle-Dweller!</i>

1172
01:23:18,859 --> 01:23:19,848
<i>Get over yourself space snob!</i>

1173
01:23:19,927 --> 01:23:20,951
Guys! Hey, guys!

1174
01:23:21,028 --> 01:23:22,893
This is not the time
to get into this, all right?

1175
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:26,497
Dexter, you know better.

1176
01:23:28,469 --> 01:23:30,334
All right?
That's what happens when you do that!

1177
01:23:30,404 --> 01:23:31,735
You get that.

1178
01:23:38,979 --> 01:23:41,311
Stop! Just stop! Stop!

1179
01:23:41,882 --> 01:23:44,874
Now, listen. You're both proud capuchin!

1180
01:23:45,753 --> 01:23:47,550
You need to concentrate
on slapping the enemy!

1181
01:23:51,425 --> 01:23:52,722
Keep it together, all right?

1182
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:54,727
Come on, let's go! Let's do it!

1183
01:23:56,697 --> 01:23:59,530
- Jedediah! They need us!
- I ain't gonna make it!

1184
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:02,402
Afraid this cowboy's been
to his last hoedown.

1185
01:24:02,903 --> 01:24:08,739
Octavius, remember me as I was,
wild, and free, and...

1186
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:13,446
- No need for final words.
- I'm not finished yet.

1187
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:15,644
I want to get
to the story of our relationship,

1188
01:24:15,716 --> 01:24:18,014
the evolution from enemy to friends.

1189
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:20,517
- No!
- It'll make you cry!

1190
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:23,853
No! Because you are going to live!

1191
01:24:34,835 --> 01:24:37,303
- Let's go to work.
- Have a sword.

1192
01:24:38,439 --> 01:24:39,872
Sword!

1193
01:24:57,091 --> 01:24:58,752
Incoming!

1194
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:19,240
That smarts.

1195
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:25,580
You smack, you kick!
You smack, you kick!

1196
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:28,986
<i>You smack, you kick!
Teamwork, fellas! Wunderbar!</i>

1197
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:34,292
How you doing, fellas?

1198
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:07,188
- Are you all right?
- Never better.

1199
01:26:07,294 --> 01:26:09,455
Listen, when I give you the signal,
I want you to open the gate.

1200
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:12,363
- I take it you have a plan.
- I'm gonna divide the house.

1201
01:26:17,504 --> 01:26:19,972
The tablet! Now!

1202
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,473
Okay, sure, you can have it.

1203
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:23,533
Just tell me who the boss is
and I'll give it to you.

1204
01:26:23,644 --> 01:26:26,135
Or should I give it to Kahmunrah?
He's your master, right?

1205
01:26:26,413 --> 01:26:30,076
<i>- Nyet! He is not our master!
- Really? 'Cause he acts like he is.</i>

1206
01:26:30,184 --> 01:26:32,175
But fine, just tell me who the boss is
and you can have it.

1207
01:26:32,252 --> 01:26:34,652
Hey! That'd be me.

1208
01:26:36,023 --> 01:26:39,186
This man is a peasant!
I am the only one here of noble birth!

1209
01:26:39,259 --> 01:26:42,228
Really? 'Cause he's got more medals
and a bigger hat, but...

1210
01:26:42,329 --> 01:26:44,354
- Thank you.
- You might got a lot of medals,

1211
01:26:44,431 --> 01:26:47,059
but you put one of your
little child hands on that tablet again,

1212
01:26:47,167 --> 01:26:50,000
it'll be the last thing them tiny
little mitts of yours ever touch.

1213
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:51,935
Why would you touch little Nippy?

1214
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:55,373
I can handle this, okay?

1215
01:26:55,442 --> 01:26:58,536
You can handle nothing!
You can barely speak, you fool!

1216
01:26:58,612 --> 01:27:02,548
You know what? No problem.
I'll give it to you. You see that?

1217
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,012
Oh, you're a spunky little fella!

1218
01:27:12,226 --> 01:27:17,630
Very clever, Mr. Daley, getting them
to fight amongst themselves.

1219
01:27:17,731 --> 01:27:21,531
Yeah. I can't really take credit.
It was Abraham Lincoln's idea.

1220
01:27:21,602 --> 01:27:23,968
You know, a house divided can't...

1221
01:27:24,805 --> 01:27:26,796
- Doesn't do well.
- Yes, well,

1222
01:27:26,907 --> 01:27:30,604
you should have saved yourself
when you had the chance,

1223
01:27:32,212 --> 01:27:34,476
because now I shall have
the tremendous pleasure

1224
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:36,213
of killing you myself!

1225
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,365
What are you?

1226
01:28:30,537 --> 01:28:31,970
I'm the night guard.

1227
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,437
No!

1228
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:46,552
Victory is ours!

1229
01:28:48,322 --> 01:28:49,482
Yeah!

1230
01:28:55,462 --> 01:28:57,157
That's what I'm talking about!

1231
01:28:57,231 --> 01:28:59,096
Yeah!

1232
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:06,405
I'd say somebody found his moxie.

1233
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:10,340
The Battle of the Smithsonian.

1234
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:15,380
Perhaps the greatest battle
the world will never know.

1235
01:29:17,751 --> 01:29:19,082
We'll know.

1236
01:29:22,489 --> 01:29:24,081
Yeah.

1237
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:28,691
Oh, man, I got an hour till sunrise.
I got to get you guys back.

1238
01:29:28,762 --> 01:29:32,755
In case you forgot, Gigantor,
they don't want us there anymore.

1239
01:29:32,866 --> 01:29:34,231
Well, I do.

1240
01:29:37,905 --> 01:29:40,601
Hey, think you could hook us up
with a ride?

1241
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:43,740
My pleasure, of course.

1242
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:48,037
Hang on a second.
One last thing I got to take care of.

1243
01:29:49,049 --> 01:29:51,950
Come on, boy! Come on, come on!

1244
01:29:52,686 --> 01:29:53,880
Get in there!

1245
01:29:56,757 --> 01:29:58,190
Feels good, right?

1246
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:05,197
You're welcome!
Just get back inside by sunrise, okay?

1247
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:21,847
These are promising days, indeed.

1248
01:30:45,005 --> 01:30:46,666
All right. Hey, come on, guys.

1249
01:30:46,773 --> 01:30:49,833
Remember, stay with your buddy,
all right?

1250
01:30:49,943 --> 01:30:51,308
Good, good.

1251
01:31:02,289 --> 01:31:04,018
Well, you're back where you belong.

1252
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:07,956
Yeah. Think so.

1253
01:31:14,768 --> 01:31:16,258
I guess I should be going.

1254
01:31:18,672 --> 01:31:20,196
Hey, Amelia.

1255
01:31:22,709 --> 01:31:25,439
That thing that I was trying
to tell you about earlier...

1256
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:30,773
There's not really
an easy way to put this,

1257
01:31:31,852 --> 01:31:35,879
- but, in the morning...
- I know what's coming, Mr. Daley.

1258
01:31:35,989 --> 01:31:37,354
I've always known.

1259
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:40,821
But it doesn't matter.

1260
01:31:40,894 --> 01:31:44,853
You've given me the adventure
of a lifetime in one night.

1261
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,401
And I have a feeling
it's going to be a beautiful sunrise.

1262
01:31:58,745 --> 01:32:00,235
Have fun.

1263
01:32:09,523 --> 01:32:10,854
Thanks.

1264
01:33:02,075 --> 01:33:05,875
I don't know about you fellas, but
this old cowboy just got to second base.

1265
01:33:08,782 --> 01:33:11,182
- There she goes.
- Straight towards...

1266
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,448
Canada.

1267
01:33:15,455 --> 01:33:17,286
She's heading to Canada.

1268
01:33:19,626 --> 01:33:21,594
No, now she course-corrected.

1269
01:33:26,199 --> 01:33:27,530
Here, head on downstairs, guys.

1270
01:33:27,601 --> 01:33:29,068
- All righty.
- Good night, Larry.

1271
01:33:29,136 --> 01:33:30,603
Hey, boy, how's it going?

1272
01:33:32,205 --> 01:33:34,969
Lawrence! Bless you
for bringing them back.

1273
01:33:35,075 --> 01:33:37,771
And might I say,
a hearty well-done is in order.

1274
01:33:37,878 --> 01:33:41,314
And may I also point out, they
cannot hide in the basement forever.

1275
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:43,008
Yeah. No, I think I got that
figured out.

1276
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:44,209
- Really?
- Yeah.

1277
01:33:44,284 --> 01:33:46,081
Sun come, dum-dum.

1278
01:33:47,087 --> 01:33:49,282
Our moai friend is right.
The dawn will soon be upon us.

1279
01:33:49,389 --> 01:33:50,822
Hey, Teddy.

1280
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:52,381
Remember the other night
you were saying something

1281
01:33:52,459 --> 01:33:53,756
about the key to happiness?

1282
01:33:53,827 --> 01:33:55,556
- Did I?
- You said, "The key to happiness is... "

1283
01:33:55,629 --> 01:33:58,097
And then the sun came up and you froze.

1284
01:33:58,165 --> 01:33:59,928
- I think I got it figured out.
- Yes?

1285
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:03,733
It's doing what you love, isn't it?
With people you love.

1286
01:34:06,006 --> 01:34:07,837
Actually, I was going to say
"physical exercise",

1287
01:34:07,941 --> 01:34:09,340
but the love thing's good, too.

1288
01:34:15,081 --> 01:34:17,276
- Lawrence!
- Yeah.

1289
01:34:19,619 --> 01:34:21,280
Welcome home, son.

1290
01:34:23,657 --> 01:34:25,090
Thanks.

1291
01:34:40,006 --> 01:34:43,635
Well, folks, the wait is over.
After two months of renovation,

1292
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:47,441
tonight, The Museum of Natural History
reopens its doors to the public.

1293
01:34:47,514 --> 01:34:49,880
As you can see,
New Yorkers are flooding in,

1294
01:34:49,983 --> 01:34:52,508
eager to see
just what changes are in store.

1295
01:34:52,619 --> 01:34:54,348
With its new, extended night hours,

1296
01:34:54,454 --> 01:34:57,150
we're told the museum
will be more lively than ever.

1297
01:35:06,166 --> 01:35:10,398
- Well, well, well, well!
- Hey.

1298
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:13,866
I see the uniform still fits
after these long, long years.

1299
01:35:13,974 --> 01:35:16,340
Yeah, yeah.
Really hasn't been that long, but...

1300
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:21,203
So, to what do we owe
this "triumphant" return?

1301
01:35:21,314 --> 01:35:24,750
Not cut out for the "corporate" jungle
after all. Got fired.

1302
01:35:26,553 --> 01:35:29,522
No, actually, I sold my company.

1303
01:35:29,589 --> 01:35:32,558
The world doth move in mysterious ways.

1304
01:35:32,659 --> 01:35:35,492
One day, we've got to get rid
of everything old,

1305
01:35:35,562 --> 01:35:41,592
the next, a rich, anonymous donor
gives a huge endowment.

1306
01:35:41,701 --> 01:35:45,660
With a proviso:
everything stays the same. So...

1307
01:35:50,343 --> 01:35:52,709
- Well, not exactly the same, obviously.
- No.

1308
01:35:52,779 --> 01:35:55,714
Bully, lads and ladies,
the name is Theodore Roosevelt,

1309
01:35:55,782 --> 01:36:00,617
naturalist, Rough Rider and twenty-sixth
President of these great United States.

1310
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,212
Come along, lad. The hunt is afoot.
Lawrence.

1311
01:36:09,763 --> 01:36:12,630
Hey, you dum-dums bring me gum-gum?

1312
01:36:20,473 --> 01:36:23,806
My parents gave me this tablet
some 3,000 years ago,

1313
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:28,074
entrusting me with one of my people's
most prized possessions.

1314
01:36:28,148 --> 01:36:30,981
- Does it do anything?
- Do anything?

1315
01:36:31,084 --> 01:36:33,109
Yeah. What's the point
if it doesn't do anything?

1316
01:36:34,254 --> 01:36:35,346
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1317
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:39,950
Actually, it has a magical power
that brings all the exhibits to life.

1318
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:41,493
No, really, what's it do?

1319
01:36:43,163 --> 01:36:45,654
Nothing. It's just for decoration.

1320
01:36:45,765 --> 01:36:47,096
I knew it.

1321
01:36:48,268 --> 01:36:52,136
This place is lame.
This thing doesn't even look real.

1322
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:55,332
Seriously, dude,
these animatronics suck.

1323
01:37:04,818 --> 01:37:06,251
- Mammoth?
- Yeah.

1324
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:07,752
Extinct!

1325
01:37:08,121 --> 01:37:10,487
- Today's technology is beyond me.
- I know. It's so lifelike.

1326
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:12,524
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Something else.

1327
01:37:12,926 --> 01:37:14,757
You'll stick around
a bit longer this time,

1328
01:37:14,828 --> 01:37:17,490
or you gonna run away again
when you get something better?

1329
01:37:18,598 --> 01:37:20,031
- I'm gonna stay.
- Stay, for a long time.

1330
01:37:20,133 --> 01:37:21,327
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1331
01:37:21,968 --> 01:37:27,497
Good. 'Cause,
as night guards go, you're...

1332
01:37:28,341 --> 01:37:30,605
- What?
- The best.

1333
01:37:31,845 --> 01:37:33,437
Excuse me.

1334
01:37:38,785 --> 01:37:41,015
You, the toddler!
Don't hug the displays.

1335
01:38:17,724 --> 01:38:18,782
I'm sorry. Hi.

1336
01:38:18,858 --> 01:38:20,849
I don't mean to stare. I just...

1337
01:38:21,194 --> 01:38:24,391
You look a lot
like somebody I know, and...

1338
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:26,564
I get that a lot.

1339
01:38:26,666 --> 01:38:30,193
- Do you?
- Yeah. I guess I have that kind of face.

1340
01:38:30,904 --> 01:38:32,599
- Familiar.
- Yeah.

1341
01:38:33,673 --> 01:38:36,665
You're not by any chance
related to Amelia Earhart, are you?

1342
01:38:37,444 --> 01:38:38,843
- No.
- No.

1343
01:38:38,912 --> 01:38:40,903
- No, I don't think so.
- Of course you're not.

1344
01:38:41,014 --> 01:38:44,950
- I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm...
- I just had to ask. I'm sorry.

1345
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:49,044
She was that woman
who flew across the Pacific.

1346
01:38:49,122 --> 01:38:50,953
- The Atlantic.
- Atlantic. Of course.

1347
01:38:51,057 --> 01:38:53,548
First woman to fly across the Atlantic,
and she received the Flying Cross,

1348
01:38:53,626 --> 01:38:55,218
first woman to do that.

1349
01:38:55,962 --> 01:38:59,125
- That's very cool.
- Yeah, she was cool.

1350
01:39:06,573 --> 01:39:10,134
Hey, you know what you should check out
is the the Hall of Miniatures.

1351
01:39:11,811 --> 01:39:14,371
Could you take me there?
I'm always getting lost.

1352
01:39:16,816 --> 01:39:20,775
Yeah, I know. Sure.
Yeah, I'll show you. Come on.

1353
01:39:21,421 --> 01:39:22,945
Thank you.

1354
01:39:23,456 --> 01:39:25,617
- I'm Larry Daley.
- Tess.

1355
01:40:00,693 --> 01:40:03,753
- Joseph, time for dinner!
