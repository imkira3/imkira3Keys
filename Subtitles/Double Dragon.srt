MAN: Thousands of years ago
in ancient China,

3
00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:43,506
an evil army
of shadow warriors...

4
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,169
terrorized the great city
of Shang-sa.

5
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:47,906
To save his people,

6
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:52,441
the good king sacrificed himself
to create a mystical medallion.

7
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:56,418
Realizing the ultimate powers
of the medallion,

8
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,482
the king split it in half.

9
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:02,258
To one son,
he gave the power over body;

10
00:01:02,297 --> 00:01:04,891
to the other,
power over the soul.

11
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:09,095
This is the legend
of the Double Dragon.

12
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:21,585
Come on! Hyah!

Shuko, Lash. We found it.

16
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:20,089
MAN: The king knew that together
his sons would be triumphant...

17
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:22,535
and return peace to the land.

18
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,699
After their victory, the princes
hid the medallions...

19
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:32,545
to prevent them
from ever being used...for evil.

They're a...prophecy.

24
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:57,442
Seven years ago,
the quake heralded my arrival.

25
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:01,315
Over the centuries,
many lives have been spent...

searching for
the legendary Double Dragon.

it's mine.

29
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:29,816
This is only half of it.
Where is the second dragon?

30
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:57,550

New recruits?

MARlAN: lt's the only safe place
for them.

647

None of them have homes.

Actually,
it's where we caught Abobo.

BlLLY: Abobo?

652

JlMMY: l don't remember
Abobo being there.

653
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:19,397
No, you wouldn't.
He's as big as a house.

654
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:22,063
Shuko did some sort
of experiment on him.

655
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,540
He looks like
the Stay-Puff marshmallow man.

MARlAN:
Let me get this straight.

657
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,504
Shuko can hot-wire
people's bodies,

658
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:33,277
and now he wants your half
of this magic medallion?

We don't have much time.

BlLLY: Yeah.
MARlAN: Why?

661
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:44,050
Shuko thinks you're dead.
We have the element of surprise.

662
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:47,530
So prove it.
Make it do something.

663
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:54,265
We would, Marian, but we're
not sure how it works...yet.

Come on. Let's go.

694
01:00:19,285 --> 01:00:20,479
JlMMY: So what's the plan?

695
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:27,223
OK, the plan is that l have
loaded Abobo's Gangnet link...

696
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:28,726
with false information...

697
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:31,093
so it seems like
the Maniacs are getting...

698
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,392
an unfair profit share.

699
01:00:32,431 --> 01:00:35,696
Once l download this
into Shuko's mainframe,

700
01:00:35,734 --> 01:00:38,032
it should start a gang mutiny.

701
01:00:38,904 --> 01:00:41,065
That is the plan.

-That's no plan.
-lt's a great plan.

704
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,572
She's uploading the downlink.

Where are you going?

MARlAN: You'll get us caught.
We must work together.

You're telling me that
you organized the gangs?

lt was inevitable.

01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:41,024
You see, when you gave them
the night,

722
01:01:41,067 --> 01:01:43,092
you created a power vacuum.

there's the medallion.

You're gonna get us caught.

Going to build your dream house?

No way.

976
01:27:35,277 --> 01:27:39,543
Why build a house when we
can help build an entire city?

977

01:28:02,204 --> 01:28:05,264
The Corp towed it,

you could use some help.

hang out with you for a change.

993
01:28:28,097 --> 01:28:31,464
Sure, Abobo,
l think that's a great idea.

-Trust me.

1004
