His brother, Ta/us,
a ruthless warrior,

00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:11,904
has taken a legion of SOLDIERS to the

Horus' last ally
in the known world,

and guardian of the
legendary Book of the Dead.

55
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,929
Horus must stop Talus before
he lays hands on the Book

56

and enslaves Ramusan's people.

57
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:45,187
For this,
he needs a fearless champion

(GRUNTING)

648
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,825
What in the name of the
demon serpent is going on?

649
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,902
OLAF: You got the
serpent part right.

650
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,159
Mathayus, meet Cobra.

651
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,664
(CHUCKLES)

652
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,465
It wasn't a dream.

653
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,336
More like a nightmare.

654
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,671
All right, let me
get this straight.

655
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,924
You are Cobra,

656
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:19,604
and you got captured as Silda and
you freed yourself as Cobra?

657
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:23,649
Staging my capture allowed me to
search Talus' entire camp at night,

658
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,226
until I found my medallion.

659
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,571
Then you two came along and blew a
plan that took weeks to execute.

660
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:33,618
Well, perhaps if your father had
told us your true identity,

661
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,990
you wouldn't have had this
problem in the first place.

662
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:39,665
King Ramusan, my father,
does not know my secret.

663
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:43,206
Come, Olaf. Let's
take leave of this woman.

664
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,083
She does not even
have the medallion.

665
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,130
I'm tired of this upside down country
and its ill-mannered rulers.

666
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,925
Stop.
Or what?

667
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,674
You'll say "stop" again?

668
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,509
Your pajama-cloaked army
is not here to help you,

669
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,970
and despite your
obvious talents,

670
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:03,518
besting Olaf and I is
a bet that will not pay.

671
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,355
Wait. Please, wait.

672
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,112
Give me one good
reason why I should.

673
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,620
I'll give you many.

674
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,578
(CHILDREN CRYING)

675
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,252
SILDA: After Talus burned
their village by the river,

676
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,622
they took refuge
here in the forest.

677
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,875
They can't survive
here much longer.

678
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,255
Why do you show us this?

679
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:33,719
SILDA: Because
I need your help.

680
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,096
Woman, I'm a
soldier of fortune.

681
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,681
How could I possibly help them?

682
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,303
There's much you can do.

683
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:43,513
After all, you are
the great Scorpion King.

684
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,441
What did you say?

685
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,060
What did she say?

686
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,690
You heard me.

687
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,362
You killed
the evil king, Memnon,

688
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,152
and saved the sorceress,
Cassandra.

689
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,159
You made her your queen,
and freed a nation.

690
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:02,623
Freed a nation?
It's pure fantasy, I can assure you.

691
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,245
More like legend.
OLAF: Legend?

692
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,793
My father told me this
story when I was younger.

693
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:09,042
Sounded like a fairy tale.

694
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:12,216
(LAUGHING) She heard
about you from a fairy tale.

695
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,339
Quiet.

696
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:16,545
Why so defensive?

697
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,714
Is it true?

698
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,601
I'm tired of this nonsense.

699
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,221
Let's go.

700
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,284
You may have heard
this fantastic tale,

701
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,075
but how would you know it's him
if you've never seen his face?

702
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,373
That he is Akkadian is obvious.

703
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,960
As for being the great
Scorpion King, I suspected,

704
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,920
but wasn't certain.

705
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,538
Until now.

706
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:57,220
Mathayus is a mercenary, not this
king you have him confused with.

707
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,844
Right?

708
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:18,024
HATHOR: Sire, we are
prepared to attack.

709
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,985
A spy has returned, but he
could not locate the Book.

710
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,696
We suspect that
Ramusan has hidden it.

711
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,452
Of course he has.

712
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,999
OFFICER: Catapults, fire!

713
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,975
At last, victory is ours.

714
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,399
RAMUSAN: Death
to the invaders!

715
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,904
Fight to the death!

716
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:14,797
Protect the Book at any cost!

717
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,314
If we are to believe his
servants, King Ramusan has fled.

718
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,570
Without the Book of the Dead?
Never.

719
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,496
When we find
the secret chamber,

720
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:50,537
we find the Book
and its keeper.

721
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:00,589
We are warriors, Ramusan.

722
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:04,513
Stop hiding like a quivering
handmaiden and bring me the Book.

723
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,304
This may be my final breath,

724
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,850
but the people of this land will
rise above my failures as a king.

725
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:18,773
And you will need much more than the
army you brought to break them.

726
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,940
You know, you might be correct.

727
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:33,543
Now if only I had a weapon

728
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:43,044
at my disposal

729
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:50,726
that would rid
me of these pests.

730
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:51,802

731
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,638

Simply a guide,
collection of words is all.

735
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,953
The text is useless...

736
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,827
Without the medallion, I know.

Yes, Sire.

You know, I find it so ironic

740
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:30,053
that soon he too will
become part of this text.

00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,428
Very humorous.

You can say anything you like,
but your eyes say it is true.

I may have been, but that
man is dead and buried.

Many names can be shed and
forgotten in this life, Mathayus.

If you truly want
to help your people,

you'll find a man
that did not fail his.

755

The gods have their way,

and not even the mightiest
of men can stop it.

There are more than 500,000
people in this country.

758
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:11,071
Talus will not stop until he enslaves
them all to build his empire.

759
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,447
Then he will march
on Horus' kingdom

01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,576
with the largest army
anyone has ever seen before.

Fight with me and
we can stop him.

And maybe, in some small way, you
can forgive yourself for the past.

763
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,545
I will never forgive
myself for the past.

never have a future.

And drink.

So is this quest over?

Even though every fiber in
my being is against it,

774

their messenger, tell them this.
