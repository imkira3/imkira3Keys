2
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,866
- You're looking good, Dutch.
- It's been a long time, General.

3
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,244
Come on inside.

4
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,999
18 hours ago, we lost a chopper...
carrying a cabinet minister and his aide

5
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,209
from this charming little country.

6
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:16,297
We've got a transponder fixed
on their position... about here.

7
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:22,595
This cabinet minister, does he always travel
on the wrong side of the border?

8
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,768
Apparently, they strayed off course.
We're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.

9
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,564
So why don't you use the regular army?
What do you need us for?

10
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,984
Cos some damn fool
accused you of being the best.

11
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,326
Dillon.

12
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,621
You son of a bitch.

13
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:59,049
What's the matter? The CIA got you
pushing too many pencils?

14
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,430
- Had enough?
- Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.

15
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,396
- Never did know when to quit.
- Damn good to see you, Dutch.

16
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,525
- What is this fucking tie business?
- Forget about my tie.

17
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:21,196
I heard about that job you pulled off in Berlin.
Very nice, Dutch.

18
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,032
- Good old days.
- Yeah, like the good old days.

19
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,535
- Then how come you passed on Libya?
- That wasn't my style.

20
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,996
You got no style, Dutch. You know that.

21
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,582
Come on. Why'd you pass?

22
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:39,130
We're a rescue team, not assassins.

23
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,468
Now, what we gotta do?

24
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,222
That cabinet minister
is important to our scope of operations.

25
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,476
A couple of our friends are about to
get squeezed and we can't let that happen.

26
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,021
We need the best. That's why you're here.

27
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,775
- Go on.
- Simple setup. One-day operation.

28
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:04,322
We pick up their trail at the chopper,
grab those hostages, and bounce back.

29
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,368
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm goin' in with you, Dutch.

30
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:15,291
General, my team always works alone.
You know that.

31
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,712
I'm afraid we all have our orders, Major.

32
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:24,384
Once you reach your objective, Dillon will
evaluate the situation and take charge.

33
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:34,162
<i>Delta One-Zero to Two Leader.</i>

34
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,916
Rendezvous points and radio freqs
are indicated and fixed.

35
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,586
- AWACS contact on four-hour intervals.
- Who's our backup?

36
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,339
No such thing. This is a one-way ticket.

37
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,884
Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

38
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,304
This is getting better by the minute.

39
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,156
Billy!

40
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,702
Billy! The other day
I went up to my girlfriend. I said,

41
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,204
"You know, I'd like a little pussy."

42
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,499
She said, "Me, too. Mine's as big as a house."

43
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,837
You see, she wanted
a littler one cos hers was...

44
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,550
big as a house.

45
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,309
Get that stinkin' shit out of my face.

46
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,189
Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here.

47
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,526
This stuff'll make you
a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus,

48
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,403
just like me.

49
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,905
Strap this on your sore ass, Blain.

50
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,670
That was in '72. Me and Dutch both got one.

51
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,362
That's a real nasty habit you got there.

52
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,431
<i>You got it, Leader.</i>

53
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,065
Never knew how much I missed this, Dutch.

54
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,734
You never were that smart.

55
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,707
Hawkins, you're up.

56
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,876
<i>Lines away.</i>

57
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:16,504
The pilots have been shot in the head.
Whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.

58
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:20,175
- Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
- There's something else, Major.

59
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,385
This is no ordinary army taxi.

60
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,805
It looks more like a surveillance bird to me.

61
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:29,726
- Pick up the trail yet?
- Billy's on it.

62
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:34,856
Heat seeker, Dillon. Pretty sophisticated
for a bunch of half-assed mountain boys.

63
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,692
I guess they're getting
better equipped every day.

64
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,903
There were 12 guerrillas.

65
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,573
They took the two men from the helicopter,
but there's something else.

66
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,994
- What do you mean?
- Six men wearing US-issued army boots.

67
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,374
They came in from the north,
and then they followed the guerrillas.

68
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,835
Mean anything to you?

69
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:01,758
Probably just another rebel patrol.
They operate in here all the time.

70
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,096
Get ahead and see what you can find.

71
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,794
What's he got?

72
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,256
Same business. Guerrillas hauling
two guys from the chopper,

73
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,259
followed by men with American equipment.

74
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,386
Do you remember Afghanistan?

75
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,806
Trying to forget it. Come on.

76
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,228
Holy mother of God.

77
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,089
Jim Hopper.

78
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,592
Mac, cut 'em down.

79
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,354
I knew these men.

80
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:05,567
Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.
What the hell were they doing here?

81
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,820
I don't know, Dutch. This is inhuman.

82
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,823
Nobody told me
there was an operation in this area.

83
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,744
- They shouldn't have been here.
- Somebody sent them.

84
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,417
The guerrillas skinned them?

85
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,045
Why did they skin them?

86
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,631
Ain't no way for no soldier to die.

87
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,598
- What happened here, Billy?
- Strange, Major.

88
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,309
There was a firefight.

89
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,604
They were shooting in all directions.

90
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,106
I can't believe Hopper
walked into an ambush.

91
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,984
I don't believe he did.

92
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,321
I can't find a single track.

93
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:55,575
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What about the rest of Hopper's men?

94
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,244
There's no sign, sir.

95
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,623
They never left here.

96
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,669
It's like they just disappeared.

97
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:12,175
Stick with the guerrilla trail.
Let's get the hostages.

98
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:16,471
We move, five-metre spread. No sound.

99
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,225
It's time to let old painless out the bag.

100
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,064
Payback time.

101
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:01,159
You're ghostin' us, motherfucker.
I don't care who you are back in the world.

102
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:06,956
You give our position one more time,
I'll bleed you, real quiet, and leave you here.

103
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,209
Got that?

104
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,911
Fuck you.

105
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,485
He killed one of the hostages. We move.

106
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,653
Mac, Blain - the nest.

107
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,531
Billy, Poncho - the guard.
Hawkins, Dillon - backup.

108
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:07,077
As soon as they're set, I hit the fuel dump.

109
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,095
One down.

110
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:09,074
What the hell's he doin'?

111
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,548
What the fuck...?

112
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:37,310
Showtime, kid.

113
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,879
Target's the centre of the palapa.

114
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,364
Dutch, on your nine.

115
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,306
Get that mother.

116
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,810
Stick around.

117
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,521
Hostages inside.

118
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,778
Knock, knock.

119
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,332
I got 'em.

120
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:50,211
Hawkins, call in position and situation.
Get Con Op on the hook.

121
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,297
You got it, Major.

122
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,973
Shit.

123
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:05,727
Mac. Any sign of the other hostage?

124
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:11,358
Found the other guy - he's dead, too -
and the gear from the chopper.

125
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:14,736
But if they're Central American,
I'm a goddamn Chinaman.

126
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:19,574
From the looks of it, our cabinet minister was
CIA. Another thing, Major. We were lucky.

127
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:23,995
Other guys they waxed...
were Russian military advisers.

128
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,373
Something pretty big
was gonna happen here.

129
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:29,125
Good work, Mac. Clear the area. No traces.

130
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,961
Get the men ready to move.

131
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:43,264
Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.

132
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:47,435
- You're hit. You're bleedin', man.
- I ain't got time to bleed.

133
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,612
You got time to duck?

134
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:05,620
This is goddamn beautiful.

135
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:14,421
Goddamn jackpot.
This is more than we ever thought we'd get.

136
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:17,132
We got those bastards.

137
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:22,345
- We got 'em.
- I think this is what you're looking for.

138
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:26,766
You set us up. It's all bullshit. All of it.

139
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,021
The cabinet minister, the whole business.
Got us in here to do your dirty work.

140
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:34,899
We stopped a major invasion.
In three days they'd have crossed the border.

141
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:38,486
- Why us?
- Because nobody else could've pulled it off.

142
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,533
- You're pissed about the cover story.
- So, what story did you hand to Hopper?

143
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:48,538
We've been looking for this place for months.
My men were in that chopper when it got hit.

144
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:52,834
- Hopper went in and he disappeared.
- He didn't disappear. He was skinned alive.

145
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,587
I had to get somebody
who could crack these bastards.

146
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:00,175
So you cooked up a story
and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder.

147
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,263
What happened to you, Dillon?

148
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,224
You used to be somebody I could trust.

149
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:10,685
I woke up.

150
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,104
Why don't you?

151
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,190
You're an asset,

152
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:17,901
an expendable asset,

153
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:21,988
and I used you to get the job done. Got it?

154
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,743
My men are not expendable.

155
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,456
And I don't do this kind of work.

156
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:36,461
Major, we stepped into some real shit here.

157
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:41,424
We've got guerrillas all over the place.
Can't be more than one, two miles away.

158
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,635
- How much time?
- Half an hour, maybe less.

159
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:48,139
- Tell Mac we move in five.
- She goes with us. She's too valuable.

160
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:51,226
She'll give away our position
any chance she gets. No deal.

161
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,561
You're still under orders, Major.

162
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:56,481
Now, you wanna make that call or should I?

163
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:01,361
She's your baggage.
You fall behind and you're on your own.

164
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:14,624
This place is too hot for a pickup. They won't
touch us till we get over the border.

165
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:19,921
Billy. Give me a way out of this hole.
Aerial says we are cut off.

166
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:23,758
The only way outta here
is that valley that leads to the east.

167
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,428
I wouldn't waste that on a broke-dick dog.

168
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,639
Not much choice.

169
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:32,809
Poncho, take lead. Double-time it.

170
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:53,580
Dillon.

171
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,209
Over here.

172
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,932
- Turn around.
- Why?

173
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,445
Thanks.

174
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,948
Any time.

175
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:36,289
Billy.

176
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:41,002
The other day
I was goin' down on my girlfriend.

177
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:45,382
I said to her, "Jeez, you've got a big pussy.
Jeez, you've got a big pussy."

178
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:49,052
She said, "Why did you say that twice?"
I said, "I didn't."

179
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:54,474
See, it was cos of the echo.

180
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,355
Over here.

181
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:25,690
Turn around.

182
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:29,944
Turn around. Over here.

183
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,952
Any time.

184
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:53,677
Any time.

185
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:39,407
Goddamn.

186
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:44,120
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

187
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:47,749
I've seen some bad-ass bush before, man,
but nothin' like this.

188
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:52,337
I hear you. This shit's somethin'.

189
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,840
Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.

190
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:59,844
Hey, a little taste of home.

191
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:07,060
You lose it here, you're in a world of hurt.

192
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:19,072
Come on. Stop sandbaggin' it. Now, get up.

193
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:21,992
Come on, get up. Would you get up?

194
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:35,380
Maybe you'd better
put her on a leash, agent man.

195
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:46,141
Try it again... please.

196
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,749
What's got Billy so spooked?

197
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:54,876
Can't say, Major.

198
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,671
Been acting squirrely all morning.

199
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:01,257
That damn nose of his... it's weird.

200
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:45,176
What is it?

201
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,264
Billy...

202
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:54,894
What the hell is wrong with you?

203
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:01,067
There's something in those trees.

204
00:40:37,562 --> 00:40:40,148
Do you see anything?

205
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:42,317
Up there.

206
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,695
Nothing.

207
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:49,532
What do you think?

208
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,790
I guess it's nothing, Major.

209
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,014
Please.

210
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,724
Please.

211
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,090
Billy, break left.

212
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:12,092
Mac, right.

213
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:16,596
- What the...? This isn't her blood.
- What the hell'd you do to him?

214
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,808
Major... you'd better take a look at this.

215
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:21,893
Did you find Hawkins?

216
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:23,603
I...

217
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,897
I can't tell.

218
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:45,458
What in God's name...?

219
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,752
I think it's Hawkins.

220
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:53,091
- Where the hell is his body?
- There's no sign of it.

221
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,137
Ask her what happened.

222
00:44:17,198 --> 00:44:20,744
She says the jungle...
it just came alive and took him.

223
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:24,080
Bullshit. That's not what she said.

224
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:27,917
- It doesn't make sense.
- Those sappers have followed us...

225
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:30,712
They've been in front of us. This woman...

226
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:33,173
Hold it.

227
00:44:33,256 --> 00:44:37,802
Hold it. Why didn't they take
his radio or his weapon?

228
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,388
Why didn't she escape?

229
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:45,185
- Hopper.
- What?

230
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:51,358
They did the same thing to Jim Hopper.

231
00:44:54,861 --> 00:45:00,408
I want Hawkins' body found. Sweep pattern.
Double back. 50 metres. Let's go.

232
00:46:51,227 --> 00:46:53,688
Come on in, you fuckers.

233
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:56,358
Come on in.

234
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:58,943
Old painless is waitin'.

235
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:30,225
Sergeant.

236
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,899
Motherfucker.

237
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:11,075
- What happened?
- I saw it.

238
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:13,453
- You saw what?
- I saw it.

239
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:33,014
Blain.

240
00:49:33,097 --> 00:49:36,893
No powder burns, no shrapnel.

241
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:42,607
The wound's all fused, cauterised.
What the hell could have done this to a man?

242
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,234
Mac.

243
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:47,028
Mac, look at me.

244
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:50,281
- Who did this?
- I don't know, goddamn it.

245
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:53,159
I saw something.

246
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:58,540
Not a thing. Not a fuckin' trace.

247
00:49:58,623 --> 00:50:02,126
No blood, no bodies. We hit nothing.

248
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:13,513
Dillon, better get on the radio.

249
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:17,016
Mac.

250
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:19,435
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,649
I want a defensive position above that ridge
mined with everything we've got.

252
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:30,155
- Put him in his poncho. Take him with us.
- I got him.

253
00:51:34,385 --> 00:51:38,223
Major, I set up flares, frags and claymores.

254
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:42,143
Nothing's coming near this place
without tripping on somethin'.

255
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,646
Thank you, Sergeant.

256
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:47,524
Mac.

257
00:51:48,983 --> 00:51:51,945
He was a good soldier.

258
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:55,156
He was...

259
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:58,243
my friend.

260
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,604
Goodbye, bro.

261
00:54:14,337 --> 00:54:18,758
Blazer One, I repeat, extraction necessary.

262
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:21,302
Say again, Blazer One. Say again.

263
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:25,682
<i>Request for extraction denied.
Area is still compromised.</i>

264
00:54:25,765 --> 00:54:31,729
<i>Proceed to sector 3,000 for prisoner
extraction. Priority, out. Next contact 0930.</i>

265
00:54:31,813 --> 00:54:34,858
Roger, Blazer One. 1030 hours.

266
00:54:34,941 --> 00:54:37,026
Damn bastards.

267
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,113
They say we're still in too far.
They can't risk coming in.

268
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:43,658
We're assets, Dillon. Expendable assets.

269
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:46,369
It comes with the job. I can accept it.

270
00:54:46,452 --> 00:54:49,122
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

271
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:55,253
Shitload of good a chopper's
gonna do us in here anyhow.

272
00:54:58,173 --> 00:55:00,967
Sergeant?

273
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:03,553
Sergeant. Who hit us today?

274
00:55:04,637 --> 00:55:06,347
I don't know.

275
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:10,143
I only saw one of them camouflaged.

276
00:55:10,226 --> 00:55:12,520
He was there.

277
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:14,939
Those eyes disappeared.

278
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:17,025
What was that?

279
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:18,985
Those eyes, they...

280
00:55:19,068 --> 00:55:21,029
they disappeared.

281
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:25,742
I know one thing, Major.
I drew and fired straight at it.

282
00:55:25,825 --> 00:55:30,413
Capped off 200 rounds
in the Minigun... Full pack.

283
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:34,584
Nothing... nothing on this earth
could have lived.

284
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:38,087
Not at that range.

285
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:45,053
Mac, you take first watch,
then you get some rest.

286
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:51,267
Ask her. Ask her what she saw.
Ask her what happened to Hawkins.

287
00:55:51,684 --> 00:55:54,312
Go ahead. Ask her.

288
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:07,951
She says the same fuckin' thing.
The jungle, it came alive and took him.

289
00:56:08,034 --> 00:56:11,704
Billy... you know something. What is it?

290
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:17,418
- I'm scared, Poncho.
- Bullshit. You ain't afraid of no man.

291
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:21,506
There's something out there waiting for us,

292
00:56:22,507 --> 00:56:24,634
and it ain't no man.

293
00:56:32,934 --> 00:56:35,311
We're all gonna die.

294
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:42,694
He's losing his cool. There's a couple of
guys out there and we gotta take 'em down.

295
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:45,864
You still don't understand, Dillon, do you?

296
00:56:45,947 --> 00:56:50,076
Whatever it is out there, it killed Hopper,

297
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,579
and now it wants us.

298
00:56:57,333 --> 00:57:00,420
Here we are again, bro,

299
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:02,964
just you and me.

300
00:57:03,047 --> 00:57:06,426
Same kind of moon and same kind ofjungle.

301
00:57:06,509 --> 00:57:09,512
Real number 10 night, remember?

302
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:14,434
Whole platoon, 32 men chopped into meat,
and we walk out, just you and me.

303
00:57:14,517 --> 00:57:18,521
Nobody else. Right on top, bro.

304
00:57:19,564 --> 00:57:24,110
Not a scratch. Not a fuckin' scratch.
You know, whoever got you,

305
00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:29,574
he'll come back again, and when he does,
I'm gonna cut your name right into him.

306
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:33,328
I'm gonna cut your name into him.

307
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:54,516
Mac.

308
00:57:57,018 --> 00:57:59,103
- This way.
- Where the hell are you?

309
00:57:59,187 --> 00:58:01,272
Where are you?

310
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:16,496
Where are you?

311
00:58:19,415 --> 00:58:22,085
Mac, where are you?

312
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:25,129
Jesus.

313
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:27,423
I got you, motherfucker.

314
00:58:27,507 --> 00:58:29,968
I killed you, you fuck.

315
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:33,221
Jesus. You killed a pig.

316
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:36,224
Do you think you could have found
something bigger?

317
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:39,227
Fuck you, Poncho. Fuck you.

318
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:44,315
- Where's the girl?
- Shit.

319
00:58:44,899 --> 00:58:47,652
Why wasn't anybody watching her?

320
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:54,200
Why didn't she try to get away?

321
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:57,745
Look at her. She's scared out of her mind.

322
00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:01,291
Major, you better take a look at this.

323
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:09,841
Blain's body, it's gone.

324
00:59:09,924 --> 00:59:12,343
It came in through the tripwires.

325
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:15,889
Took it right out from under our noses.

326
00:59:28,526 --> 00:59:33,823
That boar had to set off the trip flare, Major,
cos there ain't no other tracks.

327
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:38,411
How could anyone get through this
and carry out Blain without us knowing it?

328
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:41,748
And why didn't he try and kill one of us?

329
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:44,876
He came in to get the body.

330
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:47,212
He's killing us one at a time.

331
00:59:47,295 --> 00:59:49,756
Like a hunter.

332
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:09,317
He's using the trees.

333
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,038
Yesterday, what did you see?

334
01:00:22,121 --> 01:00:25,625
- You're wasting your time.
- No more games.

335
01:00:28,545 --> 01:00:31,381
I don't know what it was.

336
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,342
- It...
- Go on.

337
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:37,512
It changed colours like the chameleon.

338
01:00:37,595 --> 01:00:40,098
It uses the jungle.

339
01:00:40,181 --> 01:00:43,560
Are you sayin' Blain and Hawkins were killed
by a fuckin' lizard?

340
01:00:43,643 --> 01:00:49,399
That's a bullshit psych job. There's two
or three men at the most. Fucking lizard.

341
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:54,237
- What's your name?
- Anna.

342
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:04,539
Anna, this thing is hunting us. All of us.

343
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:07,625
You know that.

344
01:01:10,378 --> 01:01:13,089
- What the hell are you doing?
- We need everyone.

345
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:16,426
- I'm taking her back. We're out of here.
- We're not going yet.

346
01:01:16,509 --> 01:01:19,762
The rendezvous is 10 miles away.
You think the chopper'll wait?

347
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:24,851
Dillon, we make a stand now, or there will be
nobody left to go to the chopper.

348
01:01:24,934 --> 01:01:27,395
There is something else.

349
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:31,357
When the big man was killed,
you must have wounded it.

350
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:34,152
Its blood was on the leaves.

351
01:01:34,235 --> 01:01:37,155
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

352
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:06,226
Look out.

353
01:02:26,704 --> 01:02:30,375
You really think
this boy-scout bullshit's gonna work.

354
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:34,295
It can see our tripwires.
Maybe it can't see this.

355
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:37,841
Instead of complaining,
maybe you should help.

356
01:03:36,774 --> 01:03:39,360
What makes you think
he'll come in through here?

357
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:44,199
There are tripwires on every tree for 50 yards.
This is the only way in.

358
01:04:10,642 --> 01:04:13,228
When I was little, we found a man.

359
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,313
He looked like,

360
01:04:15,396 --> 01:04:17,482
like, butchered.

361
01:04:17,565 --> 01:04:20,193
The old women in the village
crossed themselves

362
01:04:20,276 --> 01:04:23,822
and whispered crazy things,
said strange things.

363
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:31,079
Only in the hottest years this happens.

364
01:04:33,581 --> 01:04:36,960
And this year it grows hot.

365
01:04:37,752 --> 01:04:40,672
We begin finding our men.

366
01:04:40,755 --> 01:04:44,259
We found them sometimes without their skin,

367
01:04:44,342 --> 01:04:47,679
and sometimes much, much worse.

368
01:04:51,432 --> 01:04:57,438
<i>"El que hace trofeos de los hombres" means
"the demon who makes trophies of man."</i>

369
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:19,961
So, what you gonna try next? Cheese?

370
01:05:23,631 --> 01:05:26,050
Hey, Dutch!

371
01:06:34,244 --> 01:06:35,829
Shit.

372
01:07:11,614 --> 01:07:14,117
Got you, motherfucker. I got you.

373
01:07:16,077 --> 01:07:18,163
I'm coming.

374
01:07:18,246 --> 01:07:23,042
Mac. Mac. Get Ramirez on his feet
and get to the chopper.

375
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:26,337
- Hold it. I'm going after Mac.
- That's not your style, Dillon.

376
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:30,300
I picked up some bad habits from you.
Get your people the hell outta here.

377
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:33,094
You can't win this, Dillon.

378
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:36,055
Maybe I can get even.

379
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:38,600
Dillon.

380
01:07:42,854 --> 01:07:46,232
Just hold on to that damn chopper.

381
01:07:53,323 --> 01:07:55,825
He's busted up pretty bad, Major.

382
01:07:55,909 --> 01:08:00,538
- I can make it. I can make it.
- Get the radio. Forget the rest.

383
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,416
Come on, Poncho.

384
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:26,940
Long tall Sally

385
01:08:27,023 --> 01:08:28,691
She's built sweet

386
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:32,111
She got everything that Uncle John need

387
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:34,113
Oh, baby

388
01:08:35,532 --> 01:08:36,825
Baby

389
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:39,369
I'm gonna have me some fun

390
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:41,788
I'm gonna have me some fun

391
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:11,609
Turn around.

392
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:17,198
Over here.

393
01:09:21,828 --> 01:09:23,913
Over here.

394
01:09:30,211 --> 01:09:32,297
Mac?

395
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:49,063
Out there. Past them trees.

396
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,360
You see it?

397
01:09:58,364 --> 01:10:00,742
I see you.

398
01:10:09,292 --> 01:10:11,377
I see it.

399
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:18,384
I see it.

400
01:10:20,386 --> 01:10:26,351
You know, we can get this thing, Mac.
You work your way down there toward him.

401
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:32,440
I'll get in back of him, flush him toward you.
When I flush that son of a bitch, you nail him.

402
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:35,360
I got a score to settle.

403
01:10:35,443 --> 01:10:38,947
We've both got scores to settle.

404
01:12:06,951 --> 01:12:09,746
Come on. Quickly. Hurry up.

405
01:12:09,829 --> 01:12:13,958
Don't. Leave it.
It didn't kill you because you weren't armed.

406
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:16,127
No sport.

407
01:12:47,242 --> 01:12:48,785
Mac.

408
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:01,297
Any time.

409
01:14:16,831 --> 01:14:19,459
Let's go.

410
01:14:28,968 --> 01:14:31,054
Billy.

411
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:33,973
Billy, let's go.

412
01:14:59,624 --> 01:15:01,709
Give me the weapon.

413
01:15:57,056 --> 01:15:58,141
No.

414
01:15:58,224 --> 01:16:00,101
Run.

415
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:10,778
Run.

416
01:16:10,862 --> 01:16:12,238
Go.

417
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:15,617
Get to the chopper.

418
01:16:59,118 --> 01:17:01,079
Oh, shit.

419
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:53,895
He couldn't see me.

420
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:09,696
Bleed, bastard.

421
01:35:41,908 --> 01:35:45,286
You're one ugly motherfucker.

422
01:36:03,388 --> 01:36:06,057
Bad idea.

423
01:38:03,925 --> 01:38:05,635
Come on.

424
01:38:06,136 --> 01:38:08,596
Come on. Do it.

425
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,765
Do it.

426
01:38:12,183 --> 01:38:13,893
Come on. Come on.

427
01:38:13,977 --> 01:38:17,021
Kill me. I'm here. Kill me.

428
01:38:17,605 --> 01:38:19,524
I'm here. Kill me.

429
01:38:19,607 --> 01:38:22,527
Come on. Kill me. I'm here.

430
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:25,780
Come on. Do it now. Kill me.

431
01:39:45,819 --> 01:39:48,112
What the hell are you?

432
01:39:51,825 --> 01:39:57,121
What the hell are you?

433
01:41:11,696 --> 01:41:14,073
What the...?

434
01:41:17,076 --> 01:41:19,370
My God.
