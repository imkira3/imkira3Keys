1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,998
Negative. No sign.

3
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:39,745
Wait a second. I think I got him.

4
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,741
You know...

5
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:11,061
you could put somebody's
eye out with that thing.

6
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:14,948
We airlifted out the last passengers,
Ace. We're heading out.

7
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:18,985
What about the animal cargo?

8
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:23,323
Don't worry about it. It's just one little
raccoon. If I were you, I'd turn back.

9
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:29,663
Yeah? Well, if you were me, then I'd be you,
and I'd use your body to get to the top.

10
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:32,932
You can't stop me,
no matter who you are.

11
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:36,918
Loser.

12
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:46,678
Loo-s-e-r.

13
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:05,014
Hungry, fella?

14
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:22,881
That ought to hold you for a while.

15
00:03:57,683 --> 00:04:02,387
That's okay, Spike.
There's nothing more we can do.

16
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,791
Look, Spike.

17
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:38,266
Do not fret, my little woodland friend, for
your life is in the hands of Ace Ventura...

18
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:40,357
Pet Detective.

19
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:55,073
Whatever you do...

20
00:04:58,077 --> 00:04:59,645
don't look down.

21
00:05:33,278 --> 00:05:35,515
Hang on! Hang on, little buddy!

22
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:38,785
I got you. I think I got you.

23
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:42,121
Maybe not. You're slipping.

24
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,756
Don't let go!

25
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,740
No!

26
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,927
My goodness.

27
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:08,174
Well, hello. Yes.

28
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:10,743
Well, now, that was quite a shock.

29
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:13,747
It's... It's extremely
nice to meet you.

30
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:20,253
Now, my name is Fulton Greenwall,
and I am looking for an Ace Ventura.

31
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:24,040
No man here carries with him...

32
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:26,460
- a label.
- What?

33
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,263
Oh, yes. No names. How silly of me.

34
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:33,266
Well, he's an American.

35
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:38,705
We are all children of
the same life force.

36
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:42,808
Yes, of course we are.
Well... he bends over,

37
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:46,314
- and he speaks from his rear.
- Oh, him.

38
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:50,182
Right this way.

39
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:53,185
He came to us a broken man.

40
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:56,689
He had lost the will to
sustain his existence.

41
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:59,893
Yes. I heard about that unfortunate
accident with the raccoon.

42
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:02,195
It was terrible for him,

43
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:06,999
but the life force once
again smiled upon him.

44
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,868
He's now at peace.

45
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:26,851
I will wait here.

46
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,747
- I must apologize.
- Quite. Well, no harm done.

47
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:57,850
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Fulton Greenwall.

48
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,387
I was sent here to employ your services
in the retrieval of a lost animal.

49
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:03,389
Now, can you help us?

50
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,092
Your request is not unlike
your lower intestine...

51
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:11,431
- stinky and loaded with danger.
- We can pay you handsomely.

52
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:17,002
I am now a child of light.
Your earthly money holds no appeal to me.

53
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:19,339
Twenty thousand dollars.

54
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:25,911
Re-eh-eh-eh-eh-eeaaly!

55
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:29,681
No.

56
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:35,655
I cannot, for I am sorely needed...

57
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,288
here...

58
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:40,426
at the Ashram.

59
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:44,329
If I may interject!
We are short of space,

60
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:47,900
and it's important for
you to use your talents.

61
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,438
Let me help you pack.

62
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:55,875
But I am yet to attain omnipresent
supergalactic oneness.

63
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:58,711
No. Wait.

64
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:03,349
There it is. You've just attained it.

65
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:06,586
- I have?
- Yes. Just now.

66
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:08,554
You are one.

67
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:12,692
I can see it in your eyes.

68
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:15,261
You're more one than anyone.

69
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,864
What about my medallion
of spiritual accomplishment?

70
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:18,998
Take mine.

71
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:23,236
This took you 80 years to achieve.

72
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:26,704
That's ok. I don't like
it anymore. Really.

73
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:33,278
In the light of this personal
sacrifice you've made...

74
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:37,682
I have no choice...

75
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,486
but to take the case.

76
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:43,589
Great! I'll go tell the others!

77
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:45,556
Master...

78
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:50,763
break it to them gently.

79
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,444
I've never seen them act like that before.
Denial can be an ugly thing.

80
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:25,248
Well, we should go, Mr. Ventura.
I've arranged a plane.

81
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:27,350
I'll meet you at the bottom.

82
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,686
There's still one more thing
I must do before I go.

83
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:42,832
Isn't this incredible?

84
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:45,934
It's going to be some
kind of a record.

85
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:48,471
Everyone loves a slinky

86
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:51,874
You got to get a slinky
Slinky, slinky

87
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:53,775
Go, slinky, go!

88
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:59,581
Oh, man!

89
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:03,286
Can you believe it?

90
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:06,055
It was right there!

91
00:12:06,455 --> 00:12:07,857
Can I do it one more time?

92
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:11,527
Please forgive me, sir, but if we don't
hurry now, we might miss the plane.

93
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:15,664
Of course. How selfish of me.

94
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:20,468
Let's do all the things
that you want to do.

95
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:46,612
Canadian moose during mating season.

96
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:48,746
And now...

97
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:51,482
a yak.

98
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:01,527
Peanut?

99
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:06,965
Yes. I have one right here.
It's bulky, but I consider it carry-on.

100
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:08,433
Peanut.

101
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:11,371
Oh, I see.

102
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:15,541
If we can get back
to business, Mr. Ventura?

103
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:18,711
The Wachati are a peaceful tribe.

104
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:21,980
Since their sacred
animal has vanished,

105
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,119
they believe that there is a
curse fallen on their village.

106
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:30,256
It all started some time ago...

107
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:34,359
So the daughter of the Wachati chief

108
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:37,996
is set to wed the first son
of the Wachootoo tribe,

109
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:42,001
and the sacred animal was offered
as dowry for the marriage.

110
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:46,505
But if it is not recovered,
the result will be

111
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:50,441
the merciless slaughter
of the Wachatis.

112
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,678
Uh, Mr. Ventura?

113
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,449
Mr. Ventura!

114
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:01,454
There's... someone on the wing...

115
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:04,188
some... thing.

116
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,363
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

117
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:13,465
The daughter of the Wachati chief

118
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:18,337
is set to wed the first son
of the Wachootoo tribe.

119
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:41,243
Spectacular.

120
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:44,879
This land holds great beauty.

121
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:02,030
How far to the crime scene?

122
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,800
Well, I've been instructed to
bring you first to the consulate,

123
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,204
which should be beyond those trees
on the other side of the jungle,

124
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:10,839
so we'll have to circle around...

125
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:14,141
Oh, no!

126
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,813
Steering's a little loose.

127
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:23,050
Alignment's off, too.

128
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:25,587
Mr. Ventura!

129
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:36,933
<i>Oh, you, pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang we love you</i>

130
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:40,135
<i>And our pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us, too</i>

131
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:41,336
<i>Hi ho</i>

132
00:15:41,436 --> 00:15:43,772
<i>Everywhere we go,
on Chitty Chitty we depend</i>

133
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:47,108
<i>Bang bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
our fine, four-fendered friend</i>

134
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,579
<i>Bang bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
our fine, four-fendered</i>

135
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,514
<i>Chitty Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Bang Bang, yeah!</i>

136
00:15:56,218 --> 00:16:01,624
<i>Chitty</i>

137
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:09,331
- Oh, there's the consulate.
- Oh, thank God.

138
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:12,000
If I can just find a parking spot.

139
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,003
Perhaps we should slow down
just a teensy-weensy bit.

140
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:16,871
Nonsense, poopy pants.

141
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,743
We're going a bit fast!
Really! Look out!

142
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:38,426
Like a glove.

143
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,069
You might want to think about
getting this baby detailed.

144
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:51,707
Oh, no. The consulate general's car.

145
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:54,376
Down, Boba. That's it. Down.

146
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:57,178
Yes. Good.

147
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,176
Come on, man.

148
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:21,819
Whoa.

149
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,660
Mr. Ventura, so looking
forward to your arrival.

150
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:37,436
Funny, it didn't seem that painful
when you were doing it to the horse.

151
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:42,507
Sir, Mr. Ventura has an
affinity for animals.

152
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,578
Shall we?

153
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:47,445
Shalln't we?

154
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:54,852
Tell me, Mr. Ventura,
just how good are you?

155
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:57,856
You're an extreme workaholic.

156
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:00,825
You recently returned from a short
trip to Gotan in Northern Africa,

157
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:03,861
and upon your return, you more than likely
took a nasty spill because of some...

158
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:07,833
shoddy masonry work.

159
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:11,804
Very impressive. Might one ask how?

160
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,305
Surely.

161
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:17,343
The abrasion on the
palm of your left hand

162
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,712
is the type one sustains
breaking a fall of 3 to 5 feet.

163
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:21,380
The small remnants of plaster
on the tip of your shoe

164
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,281
pointed to a careless
Mason being the culprit.

165
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:26,284
Your new watch, a quality forgery of
a Cartier, was most likely purchased

166
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:29,421
through the north African black market,
known to reside in Gotan.

167
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:35,260
- And my work habits?
- Yes. A workaholic.

168
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,097
The urine stain on your pants would
signify that you're a single-shake man,

169
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:41,800
far too busy for
the follow-up jiggle.

170
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,302
Brilliant, Mr. Ventura.
Simply brilliant.

171
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:47,571
Spank you, Greenwall.
Spank you very much.

172
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:54,646
Mr. Ventura, we've been coexisting
quite nicely with the native cultures

173
00:18:54,746 --> 00:18:58,682
for the past 200 years.
They're almost like family at this point.

174
00:18:58,782 --> 00:18:59,684
Are they?

175
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:02,787
It is imperative that we
recover the sacred animal.

176
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:06,725
If not, the peaceable Wachatis
will assuredly be obliterated.

177
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:09,094
The Wachootoos are bloodthirsty.

178
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:13,398
They consider its disappearance
both an insult and a curse.

179
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:22,240
Do I have something in my teeth?

180
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:27,312
Cadby! Lovely brunch, I must say.

181
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:32,684
Quinn. I'd like you
to meet Ace Ventura.

182
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:37,022
This is Burton Quinn. He owns and
operates Quinnland Safari Park.

183
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:38,422
Most call me Quinn.

184
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:41,625
Say hello, Tinky.

185
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:46,409
Pleasure, Tinky. <i>Corvus corax</i>.
Common raven. The smartest of all birds.

186
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,530
Rare in these parts.

187
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:55,406
Excuse me.

188
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:03,114
That's quite a wrap you're wearing.

189
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:05,717
Perhaps I could get you
some fluffy new slippers

190
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:09,220
made from the heads of innocent
and defenseless baby seals.

191
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,457
Who is this ghastly man?

192
00:20:12,557 --> 00:20:15,066
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective. And...

193
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:18,697
you must be the monopoly guy.

194
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,699
Hey.

195
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,969
Thanks for the free parking.

196
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:27,038
Another activist, Maguire.

197
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:29,868
Activist. Yes.

198
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:32,780
"Activist. Yes."

199
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,281
Mr. Ventura,

200
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:42,020
there's nothing wrong with
enjoying the fruits of nature.

201
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,055
You should try it sometime.

202
00:20:44,355 --> 00:20:46,189
Alrighty, then.

203
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:53,131
You know something? You're right.

204
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,767
Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.

205
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:35,407
It's lovely, but I fancy
myself an autumn.

206
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:42,313
If you've quite finished,
Mr. Ventura,

207
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:45,949
we might make for the
projection room, Greenwall.

208
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:47,919
Kooky.

209
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:54,126
Mr. Ventura, I'd like you to meet Hitu,
chief of tribal security in the province.

210
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:56,028
Please!

211
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:59,463
Don't... get up.

212
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:08,501
At this point,
we don't have any leads,

213
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:11,042
but we've had similar
problems in the past.

214
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:19,852
Sorry.

215
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:25,323
This is Derrick McCane.

216
00:22:25,423 --> 00:22:28,226
Spotted several times in the
province in the past year,

217
00:22:28,326 --> 00:22:33,931
Mr. McCane makes a handsome living
from rare and endangered species. Hitu.

218
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:40,705
Now, these two are Australians.
The bald one is Mick Katie.

219
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:44,508
The other is said to have
been raised by aborigine...

220
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:50,815
Aborigines. The natives call him...

221
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,887
Call him Gahjii The Hunter.

222
00:22:58,022 --> 00:23:02,060
Both are known poachers and
have been seen in the area!

223
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,698
Mr. Ventura! This wedding ceremony
is going to take place in four days.

224
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:09,801
I cannot have bloodshed in my province!
We are counting on you!

225
00:23:20,178 --> 00:23:23,215
Hi ho, silver! Away!

226
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:26,785
I've assigned Greenwall
to assist you.

227
00:23:27,185 --> 00:23:30,287
Before you go, Mr. Ventura,

228
00:23:30,387 --> 00:23:34,026
there's something I'd like to show you,
something you might enjoy.

229
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:37,528
As one animal lover to another.

230
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:57,649
Something wrong, Mr. Ventura?

231
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:06,124
Of course not. This is
a lovely room of death.

232
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:08,893
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

233
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,433
Down, Boba.

234
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,741
Mr. Ventura, how could you?

235
00:24:44,562 --> 00:24:48,567
Now, Mr. Ventura, I think the village
is roughly about a mile ahead.

236
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:51,203
Excellent. Flat tire.

237
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:56,709
I think this joke has run
its course, don't you?

238
00:24:57,209 --> 00:25:01,613
Certainly. I prostrate myself before
you and beg your forgiveness.

239
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:04,116
Don't get me wrong. I mean,
I do enjoy the occasional prank.

240
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:06,550
It's just that my heel
is getting rather raw.

241
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:13,057
We love you, dark continent!
Good night!

242
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:17,429
Listen.

243
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:23,568
The majestic song of the
male silverback gorilla.

244
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:26,371
I think we should move along.
It's their mating season,

245
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:28,740
and they can get rather hostile.

246
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,644
<i>Wee dee dee dee dee dee
dee dee dee dee</i>

247
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:36,314
<i>Dee, owimoweh</i>

248
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:39,817
<i>Owimoweh, owimoweh,
Owimoweh, owimoweh</i>

249
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:42,086
<i>Owimoweh, owimoweh...</i>

250
00:25:42,386 --> 00:25:46,924
Oh. Oh, excuse me, Mr. Ventura.
I have to rest.

251
00:25:47,024 --> 00:25:49,426
- Of course you do!
- Oh.

252
00:25:49,526 --> 00:25:53,030
The Wachatis believe they draw
their power from these caves,

253
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:57,636
but they now live in fear since
the vanishing of their sacred bat.

254
00:25:58,536 --> 00:25:59,970
Bat?

255
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:04,876
What? Bat?

256
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:07,646
The one we're here
to find, Mr. Ventura.

257
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:11,249
You didn't say anything about a bat.

258
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:13,985
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

259
00:26:14,085 --> 00:26:16,754
Have you ever seen a bat?
They're hideous.

260
00:26:16,854 --> 00:26:21,726
Lifeless beady eyes, clawed feet,
huge, grotesque wings, even fangs.

261
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,866
They give you rabies, you know.

262
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:34,173
Yes. Quite. I see your point. But are you
saying that you won't take the case?

263
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:38,276
No. As a being of light,
I must show compassion

264
00:26:38,376 --> 00:26:41,180
- for all the living things of nature.
- Good.

265
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,582
I'm not touching it, though.

266
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:46,418
No, spank you.

267
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:04,703
The Wachati are a peaceful people.
They find all forms of life sacred.

268
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:06,804
I like them already.

269
00:27:06,904 --> 00:27:10,241
<i>Bumbawae atuna.
Bumbawae atuna.</i>

270
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:14,379
Hi there. Nice to see you.
Bumblebee tuna. Bumblebee tuna.

271
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,282
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

272
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:21,385
How are you this afternoon?
Alrighty, then.

273
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:27,559
Excuse me. Your balls are showing.

274
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,728
Bumblebee tuna.

275
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:33,799
They have lived in the same
state for thousands of years.

276
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:37,702
They did not know about disease
until the white man came.

277
00:27:42,522 --> 00:27:43,875
What's going on over here?

278
00:27:43,975 --> 00:27:46,478
Oh, yes. Now, all young
Wachati warriors

279
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:50,014
must face five days of
balance and concentration.

280
00:27:50,114 --> 00:27:54,952
Should he lose his focus and fall,
he must start all over again.

281
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:57,687
Earthquake test.

282
00:28:01,826 --> 00:28:06,230
He's good. With my help,
he could be the best.

283
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,535
Maybe we should see the chief,
Mr. Ventura. This way.

284
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,436
Neat-o!

285
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:29,388
The chief says he
knew you would come.

286
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:32,389
Libby libby wa!

287
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:37,738
Chim chiminy chim chim cher-oo! Hey!

288
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,702
The chief says he has not
understood the dialect you're using.

289
00:28:44,802 --> 00:28:48,407
Tell him I'm happy to meet
him and that his sacred...

290
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:52,210
bat is as good as found.

291
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:05,824
Oh, my goodness. The chief
really seems to like you. I mean,

292
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:09,561
that is a great sign of
affection in the Wachati tribe.

293
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:15,266
Re-eh-eh-eh-eh-eeaaly!

294
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:17,869
Oh, this is the chief's son, Ouda.

295
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:21,006
The missionaries came through
and taught him a spot of English.

296
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:22,907
I like you.

297
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:29,446
My...

298
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:32,482
Aren't I the popular one?

299
00:29:36,054 --> 00:29:39,357
Allow me to display my affection.

300
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:11,790
It is the mucus that binds us.

301
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,292
<i>A bubo obe.</i>

302
00:30:14,392 --> 00:30:18,162
The chief says that the
sacred hut is over there.

303
00:30:25,603 --> 00:30:27,105
How did they get past the guard?

304
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:31,709
Well, I'm afraid he was found
shortly after... sleeping.

305
00:30:33,111 --> 00:30:37,214
At ease, soldier.
We all make mistakes.

306
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:53,031
Quite an auspicious dwelling
for a filthy flying weasel.

307
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:54,866
<i>Alla Shikaka!</i>

308
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:57,435
Please, Mr. Ventura.
That is sacred ground.

309
00:30:57,535 --> 00:31:00,538
I'm sorry, but only the Wachati
are allowed to step there.

310
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,541
Hey... Take it easy.

311
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,744
I'm the loogie guy, remember?

312
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:20,291
Y-yes, yes, chief. Thank you.

313
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:22,927
<i>Dalu.</i> Thank you.

314
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:27,733
The chief says unless the sacred bat is
returned before the marriage of the princess,

315
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:31,636
the entire Wachati tribe
will meet their death.

316
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:33,972
What type of bat are
we talking about here?

317
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:36,540
The great white bat, of course.

318
00:31:45,616 --> 00:31:49,820
<i>- Corpus kilochiroptera?</i>
- Yes, but to the natives...

319
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,322
<i>Shikaka.</i>

320
00:31:56,126 --> 00:31:57,260
<i>Shikaka?</i>

321
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,768
<i>Shikaka!</i>

322
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:08,740
Shikasha!

323
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,542
Shh... Shish kebab.

324
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:14,479
Shh... Shawshank redemption. Chicago!

325
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:16,948
You're... out of there!

326
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:19,417
Go on. You're gone. Go on!

327
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:44,925
Were you going to eat these?

328
00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:52,366
Ace.

329
00:32:57,371 --> 00:33:00,206
I've got to inspect that cage.

330
00:33:06,912 --> 00:33:08,582
My, my, my.

331
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:11,485
This fruit paste is delicious.

332
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:14,956
- And the pottery is lovely.
- It's made from guano.

333
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:18,325
Guano? That sounds so familiar.

334
00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:19,926
Bat droppings.

335
00:33:23,964 --> 00:33:25,766
Guano is the chief
resource of the Wachati.

336
00:33:25,866 --> 00:33:28,234
They use it to make many
things in the village.

337
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:31,638
Yummy.

338
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:59,167
Oh. Now, this is really fascinating.
This is a great Wachati tradition...

339
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:02,302
the virgin's dance of seduction.

340
00:34:06,974 --> 00:34:11,478
I am now a holy man. I think of women
only as the mothers of our children.

341
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,682
They are a sanctuary for
the reproductive organs,

342
00:34:14,782 --> 00:34:18,419
a temple to house the
miracle of procreation.

343
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,386
Do you have a dollar?

344
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,963
Oh! Thank you so much.
I've not danced in years.

345
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,901
Hi.

346
00:34:52,136 --> 00:34:55,339
Don't mind me. Sleep.

347
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,908
Sleep.

348
00:34:59,143 --> 00:35:00,844
Sleep.

349
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,419
Fee... fi...

350
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:11,055
fo... fum!

351
00:35:11,455 --> 00:35:15,959
I smell... the fingerprints of scum!

352
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:23,266
Better dust the place.

353
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:40,284
Totally clean.

354
00:35:40,384 --> 00:35:43,519
Not one damn clue.

355
00:35:45,689 --> 00:35:47,790
Unless...

356
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:32,536
Here she comes. Oh, boy.
Holy, holy, holy, holy.

357
00:36:32,636 --> 00:36:35,706
Good thoughts in, bad thoughts out.
Good, bad, good, bad, good, good...

358
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:38,143
You have come to help us.

359
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:41,545
We are in great appreciation.

360
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:43,880
You...

361
00:36:44,648 --> 00:36:45,883
speak English.

362
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,312
Yes.

363
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:49,887
The missionaries...
they come with books.

364
00:36:57,494 --> 00:36:59,678
You are very good with that.

365
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:02,199
It's incredibly accurate.

366
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:04,700
Care to try?

367
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:11,908
Not bad.

368
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:14,712
Try again. Relax your shoulders...

369
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:17,949
breathe... and release.

370
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:22,284
There you go.

371
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:25,288
You make me smile.

372
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:28,691
And yet...

373
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:31,327
I am troubled.

374
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:34,231
You see...

375
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:37,434
the man my father
wants me to marry...

376
00:37:37,934 --> 00:37:40,803
I am worried I will not please him.

377
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,608
I...

378
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,645
I have never known a man.

379
00:37:58,955 --> 00:38:02,226
I would love to help, but you see,

380
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:06,730
I have vowed to take
a life of celibacy.

381
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,329
Well, perhaps this...

382
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,768
will assist your decision.

383
00:38:17,874 --> 00:38:22,513
Those are very nice, but I'm
a child of light... a pure spirit.

384
00:38:22,613 --> 00:38:25,683
I am no longer encumbered
by the appetites of the flesh.

385
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:32,156
Oh, mama. Oh, mama.

386
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:35,259
Oh, mama. Oh, mama.

387
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,095
Oh, mama. Ooh, mama. Ooh, mama.

388
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:41,534
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ventura...

389
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:44,368
I...

390
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:50,007
That's ok.

391
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:52,408
I was just...

392
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:56,079
practicing my mantra.

393
00:38:57,614 --> 00:39:00,116
Oh, yes.

394
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:02,086
I thought you wanted to
visit the sacred caves.

395
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:05,122
I do. Could you meet me
outside in ten minutes?

396
00:39:05,222 --> 00:39:07,959
If I don't finish my meditation...

397
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,095
I tend to get a little cranky.

398
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:14,531
- Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.
- Bye. Bye.

399
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:26,140
Well, everything here seems good!
Big load off my mind. Oh, God,

400
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:29,330
you can speculate all you want, you know,
but unless you check it out for yourself,

401
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,832
you never know.
We should head back now.

402
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:33,834
Don't you think you
should investigate?

403
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:38,672
There's no reason to go in there... ever.
I sense it as a holy man.

404
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:40,875
- But I thought you said...
- It's dark!

405
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:43,710
I could fall into a precipice.

406
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,144
Here. Take this.

407
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:50,316
Spank you, Helpy Helperton.

408
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:13,872
I am not afraid.

409
00:40:15,975 --> 00:40:19,745
I am not afraid.

410
00:40:23,983 --> 00:40:26,619
I really like it here.

411
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:45,271
My medallion.

412
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:55,515
I will fear no living creature as
long as I keep this near me.

413
00:40:56,717 --> 00:41:01,021
Take that, you winged spawn of Satan!

414
00:41:06,826 --> 00:41:08,727
That's ok.

415
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,353
All I really need is my torch.

416
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:16,314
Die, devil bird!

417
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,042
I'm ok.

418
00:41:27,047 --> 00:41:29,049
Get away!

419
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:30,983
They're in my hair!

420
00:41:31,118 --> 00:41:33,154
They're in my hair!

421
00:41:34,054 --> 00:41:37,458
Oh, God in heaven, help me!

422
00:41:37,558 --> 00:41:41,660
Ace, there is nothing in your hair.

423
00:41:43,063 --> 00:41:47,533
Exactly. I was merely
running a drill.

424
00:41:52,773 --> 00:41:54,875
Just as I suspected.

425
00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:57,311
- Quinn.
- What?

426
00:41:57,611 --> 00:41:59,546
We met him at Cadby's soiree.

427
00:41:59,646 --> 00:42:02,917
His bird is a raven named Tinky.
I found that inside the cave.

428
00:42:03,017 --> 00:42:06,587
Ace, now, you don't understand.
Burton Quinn is a very powerful man.

429
00:42:06,687 --> 00:42:08,589
Worry not, my brother...

430
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:11,192
For I...

431
00:42:11,592 --> 00:42:13,393
am a master...

432
00:42:13,493 --> 00:42:16,062
of disguises.

433
00:42:26,406 --> 00:42:31,378
<i>There's a man who leads
a life of danger</i>

434
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:36,883
<i>To everyone he meets,
he stays a stranger</i>

435
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:42,923
<i>Oh, with every move he makes,
another chance he takes</i>

436
00:42:43,023 --> 00:42:47,494
<i>Odds are he won't live
to see tomorrow</i>

437
00:42:47,694 --> 00:42:53,450
<i>Secret agent man, secret agent man</i>

438
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:59,322
<i>They've given you a number
and taken away your name</i>

439
00:43:09,465 --> 00:43:12,969
Eat up, guys. None of
this animal goes to waste.

440
00:43:14,404 --> 00:43:16,840
<i>Be careful what you say</i>

441
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,077
<i>Or you'll give yourself away</i>

442
00:43:20,177 --> 00:43:24,881
<i>Odds are you won't
live to see tomorrow</i>

443
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:30,687
<i>Secret agent man, secret agent man</i>

444
00:43:30,787 --> 00:43:36,692
<i>They've given you a number
and taken away your name</i>

445
00:43:45,936 --> 00:43:48,439
Mr. McCane.

446
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:49,940
How are you doing?

447
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,943
I'm... I'm... I'm doing well,
thank you.

448
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,453
Don't mind me, Mr. Quinn.

449
00:44:03,053 --> 00:44:05,656
I'm just a curious little rhino.

450
00:44:05,856 --> 00:44:07,958
I appreciate your...

451
00:44:08,058 --> 00:44:10,261
agreeing to undertake this.

452
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:22,873
Meeting secretly with
sinister types much?

453
00:44:22,973 --> 00:44:25,876
Ah, not too much. Ah, much too much.

454
00:44:39,856 --> 00:44:43,459
I'll pay your fee...
the sum we've agreed upon.

455
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:50,967
Kind of hot in these rhinos.

456
00:45:02,379 --> 00:45:03,913
Warm!

457
00:45:11,288 --> 00:45:16,559
I had a dog, and his
name was... Bingo!

458
00:45:19,129 --> 00:45:21,531
Oh, time to get some oxygen.

459
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:27,069
Oh, no.

460
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:29,573
Come on!

461
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:41,985
Mayday!

462
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:53,030
Must... have... air!

463
00:46:16,153 --> 00:46:17,287
Come on, girls.

464
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,858
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
Look. Take a look.

465
00:46:25,596 --> 00:46:30,500
Oh, look. The mother
rhino is giving birth.

466
00:46:34,605 --> 00:46:36,639
Oh, God.

467
00:46:56,493 --> 00:46:57,693
Mommy!

468
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:09,840
Cool!

469
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:15,112
- Go, Annie! Get out of here!
- Get in the jeep! Quick, girls! Get in!

470
00:47:15,912 --> 00:47:18,144
Welcome to Quinnland.

471
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:22,419
And you, too, my friend.

472
00:47:24,521 --> 00:47:28,926
Yes. Yes. I know
you'll be happy here.

473
00:47:37,034 --> 00:47:39,369
Well, how did you
get out, little fella?

474
00:47:41,471 --> 00:47:43,806
You're a cute little devil,
aren't you?

475
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:46,677
What's that you got there?

476
00:48:05,062 --> 00:48:07,264
Where's the bat?

477
00:48:07,564 --> 00:48:10,567
What is this about? Who are you?

478
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:16,607
Where is the bat?

479
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:20,878
I know who you are.
I met you at Cadby's!

480
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:24,014
You're that... Ventura fella!

481
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:26,515
Last chance!

482
00:48:28,285 --> 00:48:30,921
Where is that darn bat?

483
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:32,990
What are you going to do?

484
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,925
What are you going to do?

485
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:38,527
Whatever I have to
to get some answers.

486
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,039
Stop that! Stop it! Stop that!

487
00:48:49,339 --> 00:48:53,643
You'd like me to stop that,
wouldn't you? Getting to you?

488
00:48:54,243 --> 00:48:56,246
I'll never tell you anything.

489
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:05,288
Ooh...

490
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:07,725
A tough guy?

491
00:49:08,025 --> 00:49:10,728
I know what to do with tough guys.

492
00:49:10,828 --> 00:49:12,129
Wheee!

493
00:49:19,837 --> 00:49:21,739
No!

494
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:23,974
My brother used to do that to me!

495
00:49:24,274 --> 00:49:27,644
Oh, you sadistic bastard!
Stop it! Stop it!

496
00:49:27,744 --> 00:49:30,314
- All right, I'll talk!
- Spill it!

497
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:34,417
I paid Derrick McCane
to find the bat.

498
00:49:37,187 --> 00:49:42,559
I thought it could be an attraction.
Business has been a bit off lately.

499
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:44,561
So...

500
00:49:45,261 --> 00:49:47,830
you don't know who...

501
00:49:49,632 --> 00:49:52,169
- took the bat?
- Neither does McCane!

502
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:53,802
Ok.

503
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:01,678
I'm going to untie you now...

504
00:50:02,278 --> 00:50:07,717
But before I do, I want you to
know that I'm really, truly, very...

505
00:50:07,817 --> 00:50:09,119
Sorry!

506
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:18,194
Appreciate the lift!
We'll walk from here.

507
00:50:20,097 --> 00:50:22,198
<i>Shikaka!</i>

508
00:50:22,366 --> 00:50:26,503
Ok, Quinn is out of the picture.
We have no more suspects or clues,

509
00:50:26,603 --> 00:50:31,308
but I have instincts, Spike, and my
instincts tell me we're getting closer.

510
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:36,013
I can feel it. I can
feel it like it's right...

511
00:50:36,513 --> 00:50:39,182
in my neck! Run!

512
00:50:45,922 --> 00:50:47,858
Starting to get numb!

513
00:50:55,632 --> 00:51:00,236
Three darts is too much.

514
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:34,770
I think I lost them.

515
00:51:38,976 --> 00:51:42,278
Hey!

516
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:08,105
Flowers... for me?

517
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:12,308
I do declare, Mr. Beauregard.

518
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:16,512
You are my hero.

519
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:24,121
Was I...

520
00:52:24,221 --> 00:52:27,057
- talking in my sleep?
- You've been suffering hysteria.

521
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:30,127
It's a natural reaction to
the poison in these darts.

522
00:52:30,227 --> 00:52:31,793
Water.

523
00:52:39,101 --> 00:52:41,604
Guano bowls.

524
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:43,740
Collect the whole set.

525
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,309
Ace, did you see the shooter?

526
00:52:46,409 --> 00:52:50,113
Only their feet.
Not enough for a positive I.D.

527
00:52:50,213 --> 00:52:52,183
That is the dart of the
Wachootoo shaman.

528
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:56,253
- The Whaty Whatan?
- The Wachootoo shaman, or medicine man,

529
00:52:56,353 --> 00:52:59,555
has openly protested against
the intertribal wedding.

530
00:53:02,725 --> 00:53:05,494
Has he?

531
00:53:06,529 --> 00:53:10,033
- But you do not speak Wachootoo.
- I go with you.

532
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:12,936
Yes. Ouda will be my interpreter.

533
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:14,538
Ace!

534
00:53:15,638 --> 00:53:18,842
Now, please take care.
The Wachootoo are a savage tribe.

535
00:53:18,942 --> 00:53:21,645
If they catch you,
they'll show no mercy.

536
00:53:22,345 --> 00:53:23,780
Worry not, my brother.

537
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,352
I will be as a fly on the wall,
a grain of salt in the ocean.

538
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:32,121
I will slip amongst them
like a transparent...

539
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:35,757
thing.

540
00:54:01,251 --> 00:54:03,653
The sacred bat has got to
be in one of those huts,

541
00:54:03,753 --> 00:54:06,789
but we'll never know until I
can walk freely among them.

542
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,231
<i>"Wunderbar!"</i> He exclaimed
with great relish.

543
00:54:39,422 --> 00:54:43,626
Come on, girls! Show them
what you got! Oh! Big finish!

544
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:03,246
I'm sure it's fine. Ouda is
probably going for help right now.

545
00:55:03,446 --> 00:55:04,714
Hello, Ace!

546
00:55:04,914 --> 00:55:08,217
They found me. No sweat!

547
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,854
Don't beat yourself up.

548
00:55:21,198 --> 00:55:22,843
You know,

549
00:55:22,943 --> 00:55:26,836
gingivitis is the number-one
cause of all tooth decay.

550
00:55:26,936 --> 00:55:29,805
<i>Equinsu ocha!</i>

551
00:55:31,775 --> 00:55:34,978
- What does <i>equinsu ocha</i> mean?
- White devil.

552
00:55:35,578 --> 00:55:39,683
- Well, tell them I'm not.
- I've only met you. How do I know?

553
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,986
<i>Equinsu ocha! Equinsu ocha!</i>

554
00:55:43,786 --> 00:55:46,191
- He said...
- Let me guess. "White devil, white devil"?

555
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:48,792
Yes. You speak Wachootoo?

556
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:50,959
Tell them what I'm saying.

557
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:55,032
I come in peace!

558
00:55:55,132 --> 00:55:58,600
<i>Equinsu ocha uza inkosazana.</i>

559
00:56:02,138 --> 00:56:04,740
I couldn't help but notice
that <i>equinsu ocha</i> part.

560
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,512
- Did you just refer to me as white devil?
- This how they know you.

561
00:56:08,612 --> 00:56:10,780
Leave that part out from now on.

562
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,851
I represent the princess!

563
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,063
War... is hell.

564
00:56:27,163 --> 00:56:29,665
The last thing we want...

565
00:56:31,067 --> 00:56:32,635
is a fight.

566
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:53,088
The chief said, if you pass all
Wachootoo tests, you do not die.

567
00:56:56,526 --> 00:56:58,726
Kooky.

568
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:04,467
<i>Ooh, abba wah, ay bay abba wah</i>

569
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:08,004
<i>Abba wah, ay bay abba wah</i>

570
00:57:08,104 --> 00:57:11,707
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bay abba wah</i>

571
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:15,345
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bay abba wah</i>

572
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:29,157
Yeah!

573
00:57:35,598 --> 00:57:38,701
<i>You can make me out to be a fool</i>

574
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:42,070
<i>Even say I lost my mind</i>

575
00:57:43,006 --> 00:57:46,276
<i>I know in my heart there's no room</i>

576
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:49,777
<i>You're the one I need to find</i>

577
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,917
<i>Sometimes at night, I feel alone</i>

578
00:57:54,017 --> 00:57:56,752
<i>And I know I need someone</i>

579
00:57:58,488 --> 00:58:02,092
<i>To hold my hand and carry me home</i>

580
00:58:02,492 --> 00:58:05,696
<i>My ancestor, I'm lost in the storm</i>

581
00:58:05,796 --> 00:58:07,831
<i>Abba
I'm what you need</i>

582
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:10,000
<i>Abba
I lean on you</i>

583
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,968
<i>Abba
I have my faith in you</i>

584
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:13,769
<i>Abba
Let me call your name</i>

585
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:15,672
<i>Abba
I'm what you need</i>

586
00:58:15,772 --> 00:58:17,674
<i>Abba
Let me see your face</i>

587
00:58:17,774 --> 00:58:19,642
<i>Abba
Take me to your place</i>

588
00:58:19,742 --> 00:58:21,344
<i>Abba</i>

589
00:58:21,644 --> 00:58:23,779
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bay abba wah</i>

590
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:25,481
<i>Bay abba wah</i>

591
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:32,322
My entrance to the winner's circle.

592
00:58:32,422 --> 00:58:36,326
Your admiration is well-founded,
but I'm merely a servant.

593
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:37,994
Do not worship me!

594
00:58:48,921 --> 00:58:52,391
Chief says you have
passed all tests but one.

595
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:55,895
Only left is Wachootoo
circle of death.

596
00:58:55,995 --> 00:58:59,398
Funny... that's my specialty.

597
00:59:35,785 --> 00:59:39,722
This is it? I have to beat him?

598
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,703
Alrighty, then.

599
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:58,973
I must tell you...

600
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:02,278
I do not wish to fight you.

601
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:09,651
Violence is no longer in my nature,
but if you want it, you got it, sister!

602
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:17,693
Biting, I see.

603
01:00:17,793 --> 01:00:20,696
I was unaware that the Wachootoos...

604
01:00:21,196 --> 01:00:23,098
were biters!

605
01:00:24,198 --> 01:00:27,836
Well, why don't you try
this on and see how it fits?

606
01:00:31,807 --> 01:00:33,009
Ace...

607
01:00:33,909 --> 01:00:36,046
He much better fighter than you.

608
01:00:36,146 --> 01:00:37,712
Doii!

609
01:00:47,323 --> 01:00:49,225
<i>Equinsu ocha!</i>

610
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:59,236
All right! This white devil
thing has gone far enough.

611
01:00:59,636 --> 01:01:04,473
Nobody messes with the "do"!

612
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:20,990
<i>Equinsu ocha...</i>

613
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:26,629
He said sorry, white devil,
but he must kill you now.

614
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:33,671
I'll have you know I have the reflexes
of a cat and the speed of a mongoose.

615
01:01:33,771 --> 01:01:37,040
Throw it. I dare you!

616
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:57,125
Ouda, don't just stand there.
Throw me a spear!

617
01:02:25,221 --> 01:02:28,191
It's in the bone. It's in the bone.

618
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,710
It's in the bone.

619
01:02:48,494 --> 01:02:53,199
Chief says you make him laugh.
You are like sissy girl.

620
01:03:02,308 --> 01:03:03,810
Sissy girl.

621
01:03:09,014 --> 01:03:12,218
Wachootoo chief say
you friend to Wachootoo.

622
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:24,313
But if curse of <i>shikaka</i> not lifted
by tomorrow's sun at top of sky,

623
01:03:24,413 --> 01:03:28,616
Wachootoo kill all Wachati and
smash your head on a rock.

624
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,723
Super. Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

625
01:03:34,823 --> 01:03:37,925
Ok. Take care. Super. Bye-bye, then.

626
01:03:39,328 --> 01:03:42,431
Are your legs sore?
Do you want me to carry you?

627
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:44,733
That won't be necessary, my friend.

628
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:48,903
I have an incredibly high threshold
for pain. Holy monkey!

629
01:04:13,379 --> 01:04:15,680
Ace, why you stopped?

630
01:04:17,383 --> 01:04:19,984
The Wachootoo didn't take <i>shikaka.</i>

631
01:04:22,889 --> 01:04:25,330
Hi. Welcome back.

632
01:04:25,431 --> 01:04:28,784
- What would you say this is?
- Dart of Wachootoo shaman.

633
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:33,232
Precisely. And when compared to
one of the darts that hit me before?

634
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:34,434
Same.

635
01:04:35,034 --> 01:04:37,703
Only to the untrained eye.

636
01:04:37,803 --> 01:04:41,308
You see, the Wachootoo dart is
made of wood from a mimosa tree,

637
01:04:41,408 --> 01:04:46,013
while the other dart is carved
from a red fungus-bearing acalla.

638
01:04:46,113 --> 01:04:51,652
And there's only one area of the jungle
with red fungus-bearing acallas.

639
01:04:52,452 --> 01:04:56,222
Go back to the village. Tell them the
Wachootoos attack tomorrow at noon.

640
01:04:56,322 --> 01:04:57,788
Ok.

641
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:03,730
This little hound dog
just picked up a scent.

642
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:17,009
Won't be long now, Katie.

643
01:05:19,611 --> 01:05:23,783
Big night tonight. You're going
to meet your new owner.

644
01:05:24,683 --> 01:05:27,363
G'day. Disgusting rat.

645
01:05:43,803 --> 01:05:46,204
Gravy.

646
01:05:50,825 --> 01:05:52,910
Did you hear that?

647
01:05:53,646 --> 01:05:57,199
- What is it?
- Silverback.

648
01:06:07,793 --> 01:06:09,739
Female.

649
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,165
- Big.
- Yeah?

650
01:06:12,265 --> 01:06:14,769
About 200 meters...

651
01:06:15,669 --> 01:06:17,169
south.

652
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:21,707
- We'd get $5,000 for one of those.
- What about the rat?

653
01:06:21,807 --> 01:06:25,059
Don't worry about the rat.
We'll be back in no time.

654
01:06:30,332 --> 01:06:32,367
Stay downwind.

655
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,601
You're even uglier than I thought.

656
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,605
She's a big one, isn't she?

657
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:15,578
Oh, boy. Deciduous trees
lining the riverbank.

658
01:07:16,178 --> 01:07:20,349
Suman shrubs with extreme protococcus.
Steadily increasing water current.

659
01:07:20,449 --> 01:07:25,987
Spike, I think we can assume the
stream gets pretty rough up ahead.

660
01:07:35,813 --> 01:07:39,317
As soon as I get you loose, Spike,
you can chew through my ropes.

661
01:07:45,825 --> 01:07:47,776
That's it! That's it!

662
01:07:49,477 --> 01:07:50,878
Yes! Your turn.

663
01:07:54,217 --> 01:07:56,486
All right! Yes!

664
01:08:03,842 --> 01:08:07,246
Hey! Spike! Spike!

665
01:08:08,246 --> 01:08:10,216
Spike!

666
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,320
Spi...

667
01:08:32,222 --> 01:08:34,576
ike!

668
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:41,147
I'm alive.

669
01:08:43,549 --> 01:08:46,651
I'm alive!

670
01:08:57,946 --> 01:09:01,099
Yee-haw! Yee-haw!

671
01:09:01,499 --> 01:09:03,468
Say "Uncle"! Say "Uncle"!

672
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:08,658
Oh, no.

673
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:12,428
Don't start what you can't finish!

674
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:18,167
Quit hitting yourself. Quit hitting
yourself. Quit hitting yourself.

675
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:21,587
Oh, water tastes good, yes.

676
01:09:21,687 --> 01:09:24,472
Glub, glub!

677
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:32,531
This isn't over yet.
There's something I've missed,

678
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:37,736
some clue I've overlooked,
some motive, and that motive is...

679
01:09:38,636 --> 01:09:41,239
Pluh! Think!

680
01:09:41,339 --> 01:09:43,741
Somebody wants these two
tribes to destroy each other.

681
01:09:43,841 --> 01:09:46,845
There must be something
valuable in this equation.

682
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:49,448
Perhaps we should
meditate upon it, Spike,

683
01:09:49,548 --> 01:09:52,852
for it is said that when
seeking answers, one must...

684
01:09:52,953 --> 01:09:55,954
quiet the soul in order to hear them.

685
01:10:00,558 --> 01:10:06,264
What is it the Wachatis possess
that is of great value to other men...

686
01:10:06,364 --> 01:10:09,768
besides the princess
with the amazing rack.

687
01:10:20,379 --> 01:10:24,266
<i>Alrighty, then</i>

688
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:36,361
<i>Alrighty, then</i>

689
01:11:05,407 --> 01:11:09,745
Oh, Ace. You're back?

690
01:11:11,245 --> 01:11:14,249
You can dispense with
the smallpox, all-knowing one.

691
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:18,354
I'm here on business,
and time is of the essence.

692
01:11:18,754 --> 01:11:22,357
Very well. What answer do you seek?

693
01:11:22,457 --> 01:11:24,860
I need to know what it
is the Wachatis possess

694
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,996
that is of great value
to civilized man.

695
01:11:28,096 --> 01:11:32,485
The medallion will lead
you to the answer.

696
01:11:33,285 --> 01:11:36,521
You do still have
the medallion, don't you?

697
01:11:36,621 --> 01:11:39,991
Medallion? Why... surely.

698
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:44,630
I left it back... with my body.

699
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:49,151
Your aura is weakening.

700
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:53,689
Ok, I threw it in the cave!
What do you want from me?

701
01:11:53,789 --> 01:11:56,894
What are you, Mr. Perfect?
You want to know where it is?

702
01:11:57,394 --> 01:11:59,409
It's probably lying...

703
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:03,397
in a big pile of...

704
01:12:18,513 --> 01:12:20,316
Guano!

705
01:12:21,116 --> 01:12:24,885
They have guano!

706
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:36,832
Like...

707
01:12:36,933 --> 01:12:39,049
a glove.

708
01:12:42,354 --> 01:12:44,156
Hi, chief.

709
01:12:44,356 --> 01:12:46,457
Appreciate your meeting me here.

710
01:12:47,859 --> 01:12:49,960
Let's go kick some...

711
01:12:51,363 --> 01:12:53,464
consulate butt.

712
01:13:03,392 --> 01:13:04,760
Hello, Ace.

713
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:09,514
- You've come for your money?
- Wrong again, Sweeney Toad.

714
01:13:09,614 --> 01:13:12,634
I've come for the sacred bat.
Where is it?

715
01:13:12,734 --> 01:13:15,737
Why, Ace, whatever can you mean?

716
01:13:15,837 --> 01:13:18,607
Guano. Hello.

717
01:13:18,707 --> 01:13:20,742
Does "poo" ring a bell?

718
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:24,542
"Guano mines as a source of nitrate,

719
01:13:24,643 --> 01:13:29,848
producing 84% of the world's supply
of fertilizer, a $1.4 billion industry."

720
01:13:29,949 --> 01:13:32,237
That's what this war is all about.

721
01:13:32,537 --> 01:13:34,607
You can't legally take
possession of the caves

722
01:13:34,707 --> 01:13:37,459
as long as the Wachatis
inhabit the area,

723
01:13:37,559 --> 01:13:41,679
and you want that dookie
so bad, you can taste it.

724
01:13:41,779 --> 01:13:45,734
- But, sir, I thought that...
- Yes. Thank you, Fulton.

725
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:52,791
That's a fine theory, Mr. Ventura.
What has it got to do with me?

726
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:57,328
I thought you'd never ask.

727
01:14:01,465 --> 01:14:04,261
The day I met you, there was a white substance
on your shoe that I mistook for plaster.

728
01:14:04,362 --> 01:14:06,901
Yesterday, I saw the same white substance
outside the hut where the bat was kept,

729
01:14:07,002 --> 01:14:10,222
and suddenly it hit me. The great
white bat has great white guano.

730
01:14:10,323 --> 01:14:12,546
That's what you slipped in!
That's what was on your shoe!

731
01:14:12,647 --> 01:14:15,430
And that explains the
abrasion on your palm!

732
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:17,666
Let me run that back for you.

733
01:14:23,154 --> 01:14:25,408
That's what you slipped in!
That's what was on your shoe!

734
01:14:25,508 --> 01:14:29,845
And that explains the
abrasion on your palm!

735
01:14:30,445 --> 01:14:34,182
Damn, I'm good! Can you feel that?

736
01:14:34,282 --> 01:14:37,285
Can you feel it, captain compost?

737
01:14:37,585 --> 01:14:42,873
The day of redemption is at hand!

738
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:45,249
Repent!

739
01:14:45,449 --> 01:14:50,106
And thou shall be saved.

740
01:14:50,849 --> 01:14:54,122
Very good, Mr. Ventura.

741
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:58,657
Very good. I believe
you've solved the case.

742
01:14:58,757 --> 01:15:02,377
One thing I still don't understand,
Mr. Belvedere.

743
01:15:03,177 --> 01:15:06,682
If you are the slime
behind this little flimflam,

744
01:15:06,782 --> 01:15:11,353
why, oh, why did you hire me?

745
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:14,689
I'm afraid there's going to be a
horrendous investigation after the war.

746
01:15:14,823 --> 01:15:19,227
You were my alibi to prove I'd
done everything I could to stop it.

747
01:15:19,327 --> 01:15:22,413
Arrest him. Arrest him!

748
01:15:25,217 --> 01:15:26,817
Please, arrest him.

749
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:30,572
Simon says, "arrest him."

750
01:15:39,832 --> 01:15:43,635
I thought you loved
all animals, Mr. Ventura.

751
01:15:43,735 --> 01:15:47,256
"I thought you loved all animals,
Mr. Ventura."

752
01:15:49,056 --> 01:15:51,460
Shall I stick him on the wall?

753
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,346
No. I don't think it'll
be necessary, Gahjii.

754
01:15:55,446 --> 01:15:59,701
Mr. Ventura here has very cleverly
stolen the sacred bat of the Wachati.

755
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:04,038
Unfortunately, we were unable to
recover it in time to stop the war.

756
01:16:05,807 --> 01:16:07,076
Greenwall, hit the lights!

757
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:11,745
The switch on the wall
beside you... go for it!

758
01:16:21,389 --> 01:16:23,357
Flick it, quick!

759
01:16:26,995 --> 01:16:30,597
Alrighty, then. Shall we go to jail?

760
01:16:40,307 --> 01:16:43,827
Hey, what are you,
H.R. Shove-n-stuff?

761
01:16:44,914 --> 01:16:45,946
Get in!

762
01:16:47,799 --> 01:16:49,717
Just one more thing...

763
01:16:57,159 --> 01:16:58,593
What are you doing?

764
01:17:04,699 --> 01:17:06,902
Stop it! I said stop it!

765
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:18,478
To the jungle, Boba.

766
01:17:33,945 --> 01:17:36,828
Friends, rodents,

767
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:38,633
quadrupeds,

768
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:41,752
lend me "your ears"!

769
01:17:49,343 --> 01:17:51,462
Imbecile! You let him get away.

770
01:17:51,562 --> 01:17:54,666
Sir, you don't seem to understand.
The entire tribe will be killed.

771
01:17:54,766 --> 01:17:58,670
- Remind me to send a sympathy card.
- We'll go and get the bastard.

772
01:17:58,770 --> 01:18:00,773
Doesn't matter, Gahjii.
There's nothing he can do now.

773
01:18:00,873 --> 01:18:03,776
We've got the bat,
and it's nearly noon.

774
01:18:21,109 --> 01:18:23,143
What the hell is going on?

775
01:19:04,136 --> 01:19:06,003
You see...

776
01:19:06,405 --> 01:19:11,359
humans and animals
can live in harmony.

777
01:19:21,019 --> 01:19:23,755
Wow.

778
01:19:23,855 --> 01:19:26,491
Sorry for the delay, Ace.

779
01:19:30,194 --> 01:19:31,997
Hey, poachers!

780
01:19:32,497 --> 01:19:37,002
Say hello to my stinky little friend.

781
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,688
Get off, get off, get off.

782
01:19:57,788 --> 01:20:00,758
Not so fast, Sally.

783
01:20:03,271 --> 01:20:05,129
Get it away!

784
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:25,532
<i>Shikaka!</i>

785
01:21:02,937 --> 01:21:06,173
Aw, he wants to go off-road.

786
01:21:11,846 --> 01:21:15,315
Nobody wants to play with me.

787
01:21:22,457 --> 01:21:28,195
Loser!

788
01:21:38,806 --> 01:21:41,877
Cadby! From the consulate, right?

789
01:21:42,777 --> 01:21:44,311
This is weird.

790
01:22:47,308 --> 01:22:48,725
Bleah.

791
01:22:50,728 --> 01:22:51,845
Noon.

792
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:56,650
The Wachati.

793
01:22:59,637 --> 01:23:02,006
The spirit will overcome.

794
01:23:02,506 --> 01:23:04,908
The spirit will overcome.

795
01:23:09,013 --> 01:23:10,248

<i>Shikaka!</i>

799
01:24:17,331 --> 01:24:20,518
Pet Detective coming through.
Clear a path, people!

They will now consummate the marriage
under the witness of the tribe.

808
01:25:57,749 --> 01:26:01,552
Well done, Ace.
You must be extremely proud.

809
01:26:01,952 --> 01:26:05,857
Pride is an abomination.
One must forgo the self

810
01:26:05,957 --> 01:26:11,363
to attain total spiritual creaminess
and avoid the chewy chunks

811
01:26:11,763 --> 01:26:13,665
of degradation.

812
01:26:21,956 --> 01:26:23,157
What's that he's saying?

813
01:26:23,257 --> 01:26:26,478
Well, I think he's saying
she's not a virgin.

814
01:26:27,778 --> 01:26:29,180
They can tell that?

815

<i>There is no political solution</i>

<i>To our troubled evolution</i>

819
01:27:23,885 --> 01:27:28,023

<i>No, no</i>

821
01:27:30,524 --> 01:27:35,062

<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

826
01:27:52,781 --> 01:27:56,082
<i>Our so-called leaders speak</i>

827
01:27:59,788 --> 01:28:03,524
<i>With words they try to jail you</i>

828
01:28:03,624 --> 01:28:06,961
<i>What's the right?</i>

829
01:28:07,061 --> 01:28:10,766
<i>They subjugate the meek</i>

830
01:28:11,266 --> 01:28:13,702
<i>Ooh, yeah</i>

831
01:28:13,802 --> 01:28:18,440
<i>But it's the rhetoric of failure</i>

832

01:28:40,661 --> 01:28:44,332
<i>So come, come, come,
every posse, come, come, come</i>

838
01:28:44,432 --> 01:28:46,067
<i>Come, come listen to the words</i>

839
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:47,902
<i>Of Mr. P-A-T-O Banton</i>

<i>I'm on the airwaves
with positive vibration</i>

844
01:29:02,317 --> 01:29:05,620
<i>Do you need spiritual education?</i>

845
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,990
<i>That's the only way they'll
ever know their destination</i>

846
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:11,525
<i>We are spiritual, material</i>

847
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:16,798
<i>Yes, we are spiritual
in this material world</i>

01:29:39,487 --> 01:29:42,922
<i>Living from day to day</i>

<i>Ooh, yeah</i>

856
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:57,938

<i>Get down</i>

866
01:30:37,645 --> 01:30:39,912
<i>Let me tell you about
a friend of mine</i>

867
01:30:43,652 --> 01:30:45,219
<i>His name's Boll Weevil,
check him out</i>

868
01:30:45,319 --> 01:30:48,623
<i>He spends all day on his big butt</i>

869
01:30:48,723 --> 01:30:52,460
<i>And he don't ever, ever get outside</i>

870
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:56,531
<i>I come to visit
I bring some sunshine</i>

871
01:30:56,631 --> 01:31:00,535
<i>And I just spread it
all over the fire</i>

872
01:31:00,635 --> 01:31:04,573
<i>He's stuck on his big couch
Stuck in his big shell</i>

873
01:31:04,673 --> 01:31:08,642
<i>He looks at the TV,
and he's all right</i>

874
01:31:08,742 --> 01:31:12,581
<i>I come from the drug lord,
the local drugstore</i>

875
01:31:12,681 --> 01:31:16,484
<i>Bug is a fly, baby,
he's never uptight</i>

876
01:31:16,584 --> 01:31:17,651
<i>And I wonder</i>

877
01:31:17,751 --> 01:31:21,389
<i>Boll Weevil, why don't you
get out of your home?</i>

878
01:31:21,489 --> 01:31:23,291
<i>He said, "I'm comfortable here"</i>

879
01:31:23,391 --> 01:31:25,359
<i>"I don't want to move,
I don't want to leave"</i>

880
01:31:25,459 --> 01:31:29,731
<i>I said, "Boll Weevil,
get right out of your home"</i>

881
01:31:30,131 --> 01:31:32,333
<i>"Good-bye, I got to stay,
I'll move some other day"</i>

882
01:31:32,433 --> 01:31:35,604
<i>"Bye-bye, I got to go to sleep"
And let the tube shine</i>

883
01:31:35,704 --> 01:31:37,539
<i>Let the tube shine</i>

884
01:31:37,639 --> 01:31:39,508
<i>Let the tube shine</i>

885
01:31:39,608 --> 01:31:41,242
<i>Let the tube shine</i>

886

<i>Now, I would tell you
about Boll Weevil</i>

887
01:31:43,812 --> 01:31:48,082
<i>But that bug is just too scary
He's sitting there all alone</i>

888
01:31:48,182 --> 01:31:51,953
<i>I try to coax him out
with chocolate pie</i>

889
01:31:52,053 --> 01:31:54,856
<i>But he would not move a muscle
And I tried</i>

890
01:31:54,956 --> 01:31:57,792
<i>To make him see that the
sun is shining outside</i>

891
01:31:57,892 --> 01:32:00,762
<i>To make him see that the
sun is shining outside</i>

Come on, little buggy.
There's a little bug.

918
01:33:44,305 --> 01:34:44,473
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
