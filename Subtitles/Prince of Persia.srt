00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:13,591
<i>Long ago, in a land far away,</i>

3
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:18,167
<i>there once rose an empire that
stretched from the steppes of China</i>

4
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:20,835
<i>to the shores of the Mediterranean.</i>

5
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:26,172
<i>That empire was Persia.</i>

6
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:31,809
<i>Fierce in battle, wise in victory,</i>

7
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:34,947
<i>where the Persian sword went,
order followed.</i>

8
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:41,521
<i>The Persian king, Sharaman,
ruled with his brother, Nizam,</i>

9
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:45,090
<i>upon the principles of loyalty
and brotherhood.</i>

10
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:50,499
<i>The King had two sons
who gave him great joy.</i>

11
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,767
Rejoice!

12
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:53,837
<i>But in the eyes of the gods,</i>

13
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,174
<i>the King's family was not yet complete,</i>

14
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,448
<i>not until the day he witnessed
a single act of courage</i>

15
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:05,749
<i>by an orphan boy
from the streets of Nasaf.</i>

16
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:07,311
Get out of the way!

17
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,598
Stop!

18
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:20,726
- Stop!
- Help!

19
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:28,767
Run! Run, Bis! Run!

20
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,509
Stay here.

21
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:10,444
Stop him! He's getting away!

22
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:16,419
Let go of me!

23
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,683
Come here!

24
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:24,523
In the King's name!

25
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,102
What is your name, boy?

26
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:35,974
- Dastan, sire.
- And your parents?

27
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:42,575
Boy!

28
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:49,349
Brother, take him up.

29
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:51,120
<i>Moved by what he saw,</i>

30
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,356
<i>the King adopted the boy, Dastan,
into his family.</i>

31
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,564
<i>A son with no royal blood</i>

32
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:00,401
<i>and no eye on his throne.</i>

33
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,331
<i>But perhaps there was
something else at work that day,</i>

34
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:07,671
<i>something beyond
simple understanding,</i>

35
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:14,278
<i>the day a boy
from the unlikeliest of places became</i>

36
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:18,442
<i>a prince of Persia.</i>

37
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:01,921
The fabled Alamut.
Even more stunning than I'd imagined.

38
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:04,523
Don't be fooled by beauty, Prince Tus.
It's a city like any other.

39
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,701
Soft countries make soft men.

40
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:08,999
They stoop to treachery
and now must pay for it.

41
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:11,335
My father's made clear
Alamut's not to be touched.

42
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,471
Some consider it sacred.

43
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:17,103
But since our wise father isn't here,
the decision rests with me.

44
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:20,809
I'll have one last council
with my noble uncle

45
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:23,946
and my two brothers,
trusted Garsiv and...

46
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:28,649
Where's Dastan?

47
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:32,223
Come on! I bet my entire
month's allowance on this!

48
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,318
This is embarrassing!

49
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,022
- Why don't you give it a try?
- Get in there!

50
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:41,267
Is that all you got?

51
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:47,736
Prince Dastan!

52
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:51,074
Where is Prince Dastan?

53
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:53,309
Prince Dastan isn't here!

54
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:55,110
Your Highness, please.

55
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,380
Prince Tus has convened
a war council.

56
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:59,317
I'm on my way.

57
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:09,221
Our finest spy intercepted a caravan
leaving Alamut.

58
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:13,433
Swords of the best workmanship.

59
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:15,899
Steel-tipped arrows.

60
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:20,337
And promise of payment
from the warlord Kosh to Alamut.

61
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,874
They're selling weapons
to our enemies, Dastan.

62
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:26,278
An arrow such as this
slew my horse in Koshkhan.

63
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:28,782
Blood will run
in Alamut's streets for this.

64
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:31,251
Or our soldiers will fall from its walls.

65
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:34,847
Our orders were to subdue Koshkhan,
not to attack Alamut.

66
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,190
Wise words, little brother.

67
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:39,716
Words won't stop our enemies

68
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:42,594
once they're armed
with Alamutian blades.

69
00:06:57,412 --> 00:06:59,039
We attack at dawn.

70
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,284
Well, if that's your decision,
then let me go in first.

71
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:06,886
Thoughts to share, Garsiv?

72
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:08,616
I ride at the head of the Persian army.

73
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:11,091
Dastan leads a company
of street rabble.

74
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,822
They may not be much for manners,
but they're pretty handy in a fight.

75
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:16,524
The honor of first blood
should be mine.

76
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:18,031
Garsiv, your hand is
on your sword again.

77
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:20,557
- Where it should be!
- Oh, my brothers!

78
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:22,836
Ever eager.

79
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:28,972
It's said the princess of Alamut
is a beauty without equal.

80
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:32,102
We'll march into her palace
and see for ourselves.

81
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,380
There can be no doubt
of your courage, Dastan.

82
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:40,411
But you're not ready for this.

83
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:43,982
Garsiv's cavalry will lead the way.

84
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:02,609
Princess Tamina.

85
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:05,841
The Persian army, my princess,
has not moved on.

86
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:10,508
Their faith has little love for any truth

87
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:12,281
other than its own.

88
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,289
Perhaps it would be safer
if you didn't stand so close.

89
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:19,687
Whatever their faith,
their bows aren't that strong.

90
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,856
Nor is their aim.

91
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,393
Gather the council.

92
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:27,429
Tell them I sit in the High Temple.
I must pray.

93
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:29,466
The High Temple?

94
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:32,473
Alamut hasn't been breached
in a thousand years.

95
00:08:32,507 --> 00:08:34,338
Everything changes with time.

96
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:36,937
We should know this best of all.

97
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:46,179
Remind me why we're disobeying
your brother's orders?

98
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,883
Because Garsiv only knows
how to attack head-on.

99
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:50,390
It'll be a massacre.

100
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,025
The Alamutians will be busy
with the main gate,

101
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:55,359
so we'll slip through the side.

102
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:25,286
Have you been drinking?

103
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:07,795
That's our way in.

104
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:10,969
<i>There are two gates.
The outer one's easy.</i>

105
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:13,072
<i>It's the inner gate that's impossible.</i>

106
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:17,404
That gate mechanism is protected
by two manned guard towers.

107
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:20,074
Yeah, well,
there's always a way in, Bis.

108
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:21,604
You take care of the outer gate,

109
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,344
you leave the impossible one to me.

110
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:25,477
You know, sire, you won't be happy
till you get us all killed.

111
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:28,178
Wonderful speech, Bis. Rousing.

112
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:41,059
Sound the alarm!

113
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,694
Hold this.

114
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:03,216
Watch your back.

115
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:16,391
Eastern gate's open.

116
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:21,161
That's Dastan's man.
He's gotten in. Dastan's done it.

117
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:23,760
Redeploy to the eastern gate.

118
00:12:26,874 --> 00:12:29,104
Redeploy to the eastern gate!

119
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:50,590
Come on.

120
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,039
They've breached the eastern gate.

121
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,271
Collapse the passages to the chamber.

122
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:05,943
Princess.

123
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:09,279
Go now, everyone.

124
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:19,669
You know what you must do.

125
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:22,648
Above all else, it must be kept safe.

126
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,801
Out of the way!

127
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,423
Silly songs and scented smoke
will do little for you now!

128
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,957
I think you'll find there's more
to her than that, eh, Garsiv?

129
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:36,848
So for once the stories are true.

130
00:17:39,387 --> 00:17:42,322
We know you secretly build weapons
for enemies of Persia.

131
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:46,249
- Now show us where.
- We have no forges here.

132
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:48,795
And what weapons we had,
you overcame.

133
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:50,194
Our spies say differently.

134
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:52,729
- You can save a lot of pain...
- All the pain in the world

135
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,327
will not help you find something
that does not exist.

136
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:58,994
Spoken like one wise enough
to consider a political solution.

137
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:03,369
Join hands with Persia's future king.

138
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:05,003
I'll die first.

139
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:17,087
That can be arranged.

140
00:18:17,658 --> 00:18:19,023
Don't!

141
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:32,571
Prince Tus.

142
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:43,811
Promise me the people of Alamut
will be treated with mercy.

143
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,063
- Hey, the Lion of Persia!
- The Lion of Persia!

144
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:01,724
They're calling you the Lion of Persia.

145
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:06,605
You've never excelled
at following orders, Dastan.

146
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:09,105
- I have some explaining to do, Tus. I...
- No.

147
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,934
No.

148
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,610
No! We have some celebrating to do.

149
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:17,143
There is, however, tradition.

150
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:19,345
Since you took the honor
of first assault,

151
00:19:19,754 --> 00:19:22,086
you owe me a gift of homage.

152
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:25,791
A beautiful dagger.

153
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:28,226
He delivered you the city
and its princess.

154
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:30,730
- I think that's homage enough.
- I suppose it is.

155
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,995
First dispatch has just arrived,
my prince.

156
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:34,529
Wonderful news.

157
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:38,561
Your father has interrupted his prayers
at the eastern palace to join us.

158
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:42,942
No doubt to commend us
on our great victory.

159
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,224
We had indications
Alamut was arming our enemies.

160
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:06,631
Indications?

161
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:09,296
You better have more than indications

162
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:13,067
to occupy a holy city with my troops!

163
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,237
This adventure

164
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,803
won't sit with our allies.

165
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:21,946
But I suppose
you didn't take that into account.

166
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:25,948
Don't look to your uncle, boy.

167
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:29,579
The decision, and its consequences,
rest with me.

168
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:39,289
I know you're eager to wear the crown,

169
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,131
but trust me when I tell you
you're not yet ready.

170
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:51,242
No man would know
better than you, Father.

171
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:58,410
Because your trust is something
I deeply cherish,

172
00:20:58,452 --> 00:21:01,421
I will oversee the search
for weapons myself.

173
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:05,619
I vow I will not stand before you
until I hold proof of Alamut's treachery.

174
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:38,655
The third step is the hardest!

175
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,786
Brother! Brother!

176
00:21:43,063 --> 00:21:46,396
We've uncovered signs of tunnels
on the eastern edge of the city.

177
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:47,923
I'm on my way there now.

178
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:50,129
But you'll miss the banquet!

179
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:53,503
You and Garsiv can handle Father
in my absence.

180
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,601
- You do have a gift to honor him with?
- Of course!

181
00:21:56,944 --> 00:21:59,037
- Bis, gift!
- What?

182
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:03,316
It's been momentarily misplaced.

183
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:08,486
I knew you'd forget.
The prayer robe of Alamut's Regent.

184
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:12,590
The holiest in the eastern lands.
A gift the King will appreciate.

185
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:17,386
You fought like a champion for me,
Dastan. Glad to return the favor.

186
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:22,560
A rare jewel.

187
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:25,572
Present her to the King for me
this evening, Dastan.

188
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,565
Sure you really want
another wife, brother?

189
00:22:30,277 --> 00:22:32,142
Listen to me, Dastan.

190
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:36,748
A marriage to the Princess assures me
the loyalty of her people.

191
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:40,814
Unbound to us,
she's a dangerous liability.

192
00:22:41,422 --> 00:22:43,652
If Father doesn't approve our union,

193
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:46,387
I want you to end her life
with your own hand.

194
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,565
So, I'm escorted by Prince Dastan,

195
00:22:58,606 --> 00:23:00,801
the Lion of Persia.

196
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:02,775
Must feel wonderful
winning such acclaim

197
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,505
for destroying such an innocent city.

198
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:06,604
A pleasure to meet you, too, Princess.

199
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:10,780
And allow me to offer that if punishing
the enemies of my king is a crime,

200
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:12,581
then it's one I'll gladly repeat.

201
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,645
Then you are a true prince of Persia.

202
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:17,020
Brutal, without honor.

203
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:19,557
Don't make the mistake of thinking
you know me, Princess.

204
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:21,993
And what more is there?

205
00:23:22,863 --> 00:23:24,626
Wait here with Her Highness.

206
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:27,696
If you can manage it,

207
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:33,565
I suggest a hint of humility
when you're presented to the King.

208
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:35,302
For your own good.

209
00:23:45,085 --> 00:23:47,315
You've eased Father's anger, Uncle.

210
00:23:47,354 --> 00:23:51,313
One day, you'll have the pleasure
of being brother to the King, Dastan.

211
00:23:52,226 --> 00:23:55,923
As long as you remember your most
important duty, you should do well.

212
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,654
And what's that?

213
00:23:57,898 --> 00:23:59,923
Making sure his wine glass stays full.

214
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:04,936
I'm told that another of my sons
has joined the rank

215
00:24:04,972 --> 00:24:07,031
of great Persian warriors.

216
00:24:15,015 --> 00:24:16,414
We missed you, Father.

217
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,820
I was praying for you
and your brothers, Dastan.

218
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:24,323
Family.

219
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:27,656
The bond between brothers,
that is the sword

220
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:30,420
that defends our empire.

221
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,331
And I pray that
that sword remains strong.

222
00:24:35,402 --> 00:24:40,101
I was hoping my actions would spare
our men unnecessary losses.

223
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:45,201
A good man would've done
as you did, Dastan,

224
00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:50,649
acting boldly and courageously
to bring a victory and spare lives.

225
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:54,482
But a great man
would've stopped the attack

226
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:56,512
from happening at all. A great man

227
00:24:56,957 --> 00:24:59,892
would've stopped
what he knew to be wrong,

228
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:03,525
no matter who was ordering it.

229
00:25:05,065 --> 00:25:07,056
The boy I saw in that square

230
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:11,303
was capable of being
more than just good,

231
00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:14,233
but of being great.

232
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:23,742
Well, in the meantime,
I have a gift for you.

233
00:25:27,154 --> 00:25:30,988
Some questioned
the wisdom of my bringing a boy

234
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:33,151
from the streets into my family.

235
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:37,027
I saw a boy whose blood wasn't noble,

236
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:38,861
but whose character was.

237
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:41,197
A king in spirit.

238
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,601
Thank you, Father.

239
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:46,236
Thank you, Father.

240
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:49,367
May I present
the prayer robe of Alamut's Regent.

241
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:01,787
What can I grant you in return?

242
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:04,153
Roham!

243
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:13,395
May I present Princess Tamina.

244
00:26:14,668 --> 00:26:17,501
Tus wishes to make a union
with her people through marriage.

245
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:20,769
It is my deepest wish
that this win your approval.

246
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:26,442
In all of my travels,

247
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:31,950
I have never looked upon
a more beautiful city, Your Highness.

248
00:26:32,986 --> 00:26:35,978
You should have seen it before
your horde of camel-riding illiterates

249
00:26:36,023 --> 00:26:37,456
descended upon it.

250
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,287
Clearly she will make a fine queen.

251
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:49,992
But Tus already has enough wives.

252
00:26:50,838 --> 00:26:54,205
You, Dastan, might take fewer chances

253
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,233
if such a jewel
waited in your chambers.

254
00:26:58,045 --> 00:27:01,606
The Princess of Alamut
will be your first wife.

255
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:09,255
What say you, Dastan?

256
00:27:10,924 --> 00:27:13,518
He plunges into a hundred foes
without thought,

257
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,688
but before marriage
he stands frozen with fear.

258
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,393
And there are those
who say he is not yet wise.

259
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:22,927
I need a drink.

260
00:27:30,444 --> 00:27:32,969
Stand aside! Out of my way!

261
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:41,378
Father.

262
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:43,956
God help us! The robe is poisoned!

263
00:27:43,991 --> 00:27:45,083
Somebody help him!

264
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,491
- The robe Dastan gave him!
- Why?

265
00:27:48,028 --> 00:27:50,360
- Somebody help him!
- Seize the murderer!

266
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:53,191
- Somebody help him!
- My prince, save yourself!

267
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,058
Seize him!

268
00:27:55,102 --> 00:27:56,160
Move!

269
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:03,700
Bis!

270
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:06,369
Bis!

271
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,504
Come with me!

272
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:21,626
- What do you think you're doing?
- I can get us out of here.

273
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:23,619
You're going to need my help.

274
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:35,864
Come on!

275
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:41,676
- Close the gate!
- That way!

276
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
Close the gate!

277
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,214
Get down!

278
00:28:55,128 --> 00:28:57,062
There! After the murderer!

279
00:28:57,097 --> 00:28:58,962
He's on my horse! He stole my horse!

280
00:29:02,102 --> 00:29:03,467
Aksh, come on!

281
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:10,671
<i>My loyal subjects,</i>

282
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:13,805
<i>the whole world grieves at the death
of our beloved king.</i>

283
00:29:14,514 --> 00:29:16,812
<i>We are all stricken by his loss.</i>

284
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,182
<i>That the murder came
at Prince Dastan's hand</i>

285
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,153
<i>only makes our pain worse.</i>

286
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:23,887
I didn't murder my father.

287
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:25,687
That robe was given to me
by my brother.

288
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:27,057
Tus did this.

289
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:29,528
And now he stands to be crowned king.

290
00:29:32,432 --> 00:29:34,423
I didn't kill my father.

291
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,394
I believe you.

292
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:40,967
You shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have let you come.

293
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:43,439
But you did.

294
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:51,409
I promised my brother I'd kill you
if he couldn't have you.

295
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:54,017
Well,

296
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:56,249
the solution would be to kiss me

297
00:29:57,257 --> 00:29:58,690
and then kill me.

298
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,151
But I have a better solution.

299
00:30:05,232 --> 00:30:06,665
I kill you,

300
00:30:06,867 --> 00:30:08,459
and your problems are solved!

301
00:30:12,005 --> 00:30:13,973
Perhaps we can find another solution.

302
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:54,412
Well, the solution would be to kiss me,
then kill me.

303
00:30:54,815 --> 00:30:56,407
But I have a better solution.

304
00:30:57,451 --> 00:30:59,385
- No.
- I kill you!

305
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:08,589
Give back what you stole, Persian!

306
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:13,794
Don't!

307
00:31:29,382 --> 00:31:31,316
- Did you see that?
- See what?

308
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,950
Go for that sword again,
and I swear I'll break your arm.

309
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:37,183
Again?

310
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,822
You've used up all the sand!

311
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:42,427
What?

312
00:31:42,562 --> 00:31:43,927
What is this?

313
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:48,600
Incredible.

314
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,762
Releasing the sand

315
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:54,373
turns back time.

316
00:31:57,144 --> 00:32:00,307
And only the holder of the dagger
is aware of what's happened.

317
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:05,176
He can go back and alter events,
change time,

318
00:32:06,052 --> 00:32:07,781
and no one knows but him.

319
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:12,925
How much can it unwind?

320
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:15,993
- Answer me, Princess.
- You destroyed my city!

321
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:20,290
Our invasion wasn't
about weapon forges.

322
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,857
It was about this dagger.

323
00:32:23,703 --> 00:32:26,866
After the battle,
Tus asked for this dagger as tribute.

324
00:32:26,907 --> 00:32:28,875
I didn't think anything of it,
but now I see.

325
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:30,001
With it he could change anything.

326
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:32,136
He could change the course
of a critical moment in battle.

327
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:34,204
He could foresee the blade of a rival.

328
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:37,645
He wouldn't just be king, he'd be the
most powerful ruler Persia's ever seen.

329
00:32:37,684 --> 00:32:39,413
Greater even than my father.

330
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:40,612
It was all about this dagger!

331
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:44,655
<i>My treacherous brother
must be brought to justice,</i>

332
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:48,392
<i>and as such, I have doubled
the reward for his capture.</i>

333
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:51,261
<i>Meanwhile, I shall strive
to protect our empire,</i>

334
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:53,698
<i>as my father would have demanded.</i>

335
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,132
<i>A new reign has begun.</i>

336
00:32:58,071 --> 00:33:00,699
- What are you doing?
- Garsiv can't be far behind us.

337
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,300
And Aksh is the most famous horse
in the empire.

338
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:06,335
- This will obscure his tracks.
- Tracks where? Where are you going?

339
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:08,347
To Avrat,
where my father will be buried.

340
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:09,643
You're wanted for the King's murder

341
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:11,116
and you're going to
march into his funeral

342
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:13,278
alongside thousands
of Persian soldiers?

343
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,619
Well, Nizam will be there.
He's the only one I can trust.

344
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:18,317
He'll see I was set up by Tus.

345
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,820
Step aside, Princess.

346
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,919
Every road to Avrat will be covered
with Persian troops.

347
00:33:21,962 --> 00:33:24,795
I'm not taking roads. I'm going
through the Valley of the Slaves.

348
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:26,196
No one goes near that wasteland.

349
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:27,564
It's filled with murdering cutthroats.

350
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:28,659
So they say.

351
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:31,762
- Your whole plan is suicide!
- My brother murdered my father

352
00:33:31,805 --> 00:33:34,365
and left his blood on my hands.
If I die trying to set that right,

353
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:35,635
then so be it.

354
00:33:37,878 --> 00:33:41,370
So you're going to leave me here
in the middle of nowhere?

355
00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:45,082
Noble Dastan, abandoning
a helpless woman in the wilderness!

356
00:33:45,118 --> 00:33:47,780
What does your precious honor
have to say about that?

357
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:53,092
Give me the strength not to kill her.

358
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:03,628
Mount up. We can't be far behind him.

359
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:12,037
Without the right sand,
it's just another knife.

360
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:13,807
Not even very sharp.

361
00:34:17,851 --> 00:34:19,978
This sand, is there more of it?

362
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,844
Of course not.

363
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:24,819
Well, how can I get some?

364
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:27,785
Try standing on your head
and holding your breath.

365
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:37,533
See what you were looking for, Prince?

366
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:39,637
Start walking.

367
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,481
If you can't prove to your uncle
how the dagger works,

368
00:34:50,517 --> 00:34:52,348
why in the world would he believe you?

369
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,348
It's not your problem, Princess.

370
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:56,986
You know, you really walk like one.

371
00:34:57,624 --> 00:35:02,061
Head held high, chest out,
long, stomping strides.

372
00:35:02,896 --> 00:35:05,865
The walk of a self-satisfied
Persian prince.

373
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:08,867
No doubt it comes from being told
since birth the world is yours,

374
00:35:08,902 --> 00:35:10,460
and actually believing it.

375
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:12,630
I wasn't born in a palace like you.

376
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:14,937
I was born in the slums of Nasaf,

377
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:17,409
where I lived if I fought
and I clawed for it.

378
00:35:18,278 --> 00:35:20,109
Then how did you become a prince?

379
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:24,139
The King marched into the market
one day, and he...

380
00:35:24,718 --> 00:35:26,117
I don't know. He...

381
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:29,186
He found me.

382
00:35:31,091 --> 00:35:34,083
He took me in. He gave me a family.
He gave me a home.

383
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:43,900
What you're looking at

384
00:35:43,937 --> 00:35:47,168
is the walk of a man
who just lost everything.

385
00:35:53,113 --> 00:35:56,742
Welcome to the Valley of the Slaves,
Your Highness.

386
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:05,251
I'm desperate for a drop of water.

387
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:08,192
That's more than we have, since you
emptied our canteen hours ago.

388
00:36:09,095 --> 00:36:11,461
I wasn't born of this desert
like you Persians,

389
00:36:11,498 --> 00:36:13,159
all shriveled and angry.

390
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,761
My constitution is much more delicate.

391
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:19,934
I think you mean "spoiled. "

392
00:36:20,006 --> 00:36:24,204
The wells of Alamut are famed
for their clean, cold water.

393
00:36:24,244 --> 00:36:28,442
Perhaps less time admiring your wells
and more time guarding your walls,

394
00:36:28,815 --> 00:36:30,339
and you wouldn't be here.

395
00:36:35,622 --> 00:36:37,089
A miracle!

396
00:36:37,123 --> 00:36:39,091
I've silenced the Princess!

397
00:36:41,694 --> 00:36:42,718
Tamina?

398
00:36:44,631 --> 00:36:45,723
Tamina?

399
00:36:48,268 --> 00:36:49,292
Can you hear me?

400
00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:55,707
Yes, Dastan, I can hear you.

401
00:37:15,695 --> 00:37:17,390
Do you know where you are, Persian?

402
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,257
And yet you enter still?

403
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:23,628
In the heart of Sudan,
there is a tribe of warriors

404
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,331
known as the Ngbaka.

405
00:37:25,371 --> 00:37:28,067
They strike fear into the hearts
of all they cross.

406
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:31,202
The Ngbaka are masters
of the throwing knife.

407
00:37:31,478 --> 00:37:36,006
Wielding blades said to have been
blessed by the Creator himself.

408
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:41,182
Their aim is so murderously accurate
they can decapitate three men

409
00:37:42,021 --> 00:37:43,352
with one strike.

410
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:48,388
Oh, I wouldn't even bother doing that
if I were you. Do you know why?

411
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:52,630
This is Seso. He's a Ngbaka.

412
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:55,232
I had the good fortune of saving his life,

413
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:58,897
which means that he is now
enduringly indebted to me.

414
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,472
So tell me, Persian,

415
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:04,636
is there any good reason
why I shouldn't tell Seso

416
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:08,080
to put his next throw just a little higher?

417
00:38:46,786 --> 00:38:49,152
So! This is the one, eh?

418
00:38:50,156 --> 00:38:53,751
Yes! You were right. She's not bad.

419
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:00,831
She could smell a bit better, though.

420
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:03,264
Still, we have a deal.

421
00:39:03,703 --> 00:39:05,000
Clever princess.

422
00:39:05,972 --> 00:39:08,372
Deal? What deal?

423
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,737
- Such a noble prince!
- Such a gentle princess!

424
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,975
How taken you were
with my fainting act,

425
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:18,506
eagerly leaping to assist
the fallen beauty.

426
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:20,144
Who said you were a beauty?

427
00:39:20,186 --> 00:39:22,746
There must be a reason
why you can't take your eyes off me.

428
00:39:24,224 --> 00:39:25,418
I...

429
00:39:25,558 --> 00:39:26,582
I don't trust you.

430
00:39:26,693 --> 00:39:28,024
And you're not my type.

431
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:29,858
I'm not some desperate slave girl.

432
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:32,261
I'm actually capable
of voicing my own thoughts!

433
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:33,629
Yeah, too many for my taste!

434
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:36,430
Oh, yeah.
She'll make a very nice addition.

435
00:39:37,604 --> 00:39:39,128
What do you intend to do with her?

436
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:42,606
Yes, do tell him.
Can't you see how concerned he is?

437
00:39:44,611 --> 00:39:46,203
- Give me a moment.
- Yeah.

438
00:39:48,715 --> 00:39:50,546
It's hard for me to admit,

439
00:39:51,651 --> 00:39:53,175
but you were right.

440
00:39:55,288 --> 00:39:57,051
I did see what I was looking for.

441
00:39:58,191 --> 00:40:00,091
Dastan, listen to me.

442
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,688
When my uncle sees the power
of this dagger, he'll believe me.

443
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:08,367
Dastan, I know I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

444
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:10,631
Oh, but your lies are so clever.

445
00:40:10,737 --> 00:40:13,262
I am the guardian of a divine covenant.

446
00:40:13,306 --> 00:40:14,796
- That dagger is sacred.
- Well...

447
00:40:14,907 --> 00:40:16,841
It was being smuggled to safety
when you stole it.

448
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:18,673
If the dagger gets
into the wrong hands...

449
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:20,042
I will take care of your knife.

450
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:21,669
You won't want to miss this.

451
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:24,816
You don't understand what's at stake!

452
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:27,046
This is a matter for the gods, not man!

453
00:40:27,086 --> 00:40:29,577
- Your gods, not mine.
- Come on!

454
00:40:33,026 --> 00:40:34,152
Come on!

455
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:50,036
- Ostrich racing?
- Yeah. Every Tuesday and Thursday.

456
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:54,945
Whatever they lack in beauty,
they make up for in fighting spirit.

457
00:40:56,683 --> 00:40:58,548
And the races are easy to fix.

458
00:40:58,718 --> 00:41:01,209
I've heard all these
terrible stories of this place.

459
00:41:01,654 --> 00:41:05,021
The bloodthirsty slaves
murdering their masters?

460
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:08,585
That's a good story.
It's well-told, ever-evolving.

461
00:41:08,628 --> 00:41:09,754
Yeah, but, alas, untrue.

462
00:41:09,796 --> 00:41:11,388
But the skeletons that we saw
at the front...

463
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:13,763
I bought those
from a gypsy in Bukhara.

464
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,894
I crafted our lurid reputation

465
00:41:16,936 --> 00:41:19,496
in order to fend off
the most insidious evil

466
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:22,007
that's been lurking
this forsaken country of ours.

467
00:41:22,108 --> 00:41:23,473
You know what I'm talking about?

468
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:24,601
Taxes.

469
00:41:25,912 --> 00:41:27,539
And all these Persians

470
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,980
with their armies, their fortresses,
their roads.

471
00:41:30,016 --> 00:41:33,349
Who pays for it all?
The small businessman!

472
00:41:33,886 --> 00:41:36,446
See, that's why I started
a little campaign

473
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:39,384
to spread some false notoriety.

474
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:43,590
I spread it like a venerable disease
in a Turkish harem.

475
00:42:03,483 --> 00:42:05,644
Behold the mighty ostrich!

476
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:15,387
Come on, my beauty!

477
00:42:20,466 --> 00:42:22,161
I love this!

478
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:28,104
And the tax collectors steer clear of me
and my customers.

479
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,936
Everybody's happy.

480
00:42:30,643 --> 00:42:32,110
Hey! Get the girls on!

481
00:42:32,612 --> 00:42:35,137
Get the girls on! Come on!
Crowd control!

482
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,916
Don't just stand there! Run, don't walk!

483
00:42:41,788 --> 00:42:44,655
If you drop anything, you pay for it!
It's out of your wages!

484
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,420
Now, don't look at me like that.
You know what I'm talking about!

485
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,520
Do your job! Crowd control! Thank you!

486
00:42:50,563 --> 00:42:52,087
You know, I think our little arrangement

487
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:53,826
is gonna work out very well,
young man.

488
00:42:56,602 --> 00:42:58,069
Don't touch!

489
00:42:58,171 --> 00:43:00,503
She's a lively one!
Where did you find her?

490
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:04,032
In the slave markets of Lur.

491
00:43:04,076 --> 00:43:06,567
I was headed to Iraq
to trade her for a camel

492
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:08,102
when she attacked me.

493
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:10,248
The camels are safer.

494
00:43:10,283 --> 00:43:13,582
Noble Sheikh Amar,
I appreciate your hospitality.

495
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,014
You run a fine establishment,

496
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:16,316
but if you could give me
the supplies that we...

497
00:43:16,355 --> 00:43:18,516
You know something, Persian?

498
00:43:18,558 --> 00:43:21,459
You bear a remarkable resemblance
to the disgraced prince

499
00:43:21,494 --> 00:43:24,395
who fled after murdering the King.

500
00:43:34,574 --> 00:43:36,701
Have I told you about the Ngbaka?

501
00:43:38,144 --> 00:43:41,011
- Yes, you have.
- Yeah. Nothing beats a good story, eh?

502
00:43:41,047 --> 00:43:43,311
But yours, however,
trading her in for a camel?

503
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:46,216
Please! I mean, look at her.
She's worth at least two.

504
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,711
And as for you, young man,

505
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:51,689
did you know your brother's offered
a reward for you

506
00:43:51,724 --> 00:43:54,488
which, quite frankly, between you
and me, borders on the obscene?

507
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,220
I'd trade in my own mother
for that kind of gold.

508
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,860
What? You didn't know
what she was like.

509
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,627
Take him down to the Persian outpost.

510
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,331
Wait, wait, wait. Look. That...

511
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:10,537
- Nice knife.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

512
00:44:10,576 --> 00:44:11,634
It's nothing.

513
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:15,943
- No, look, that's worthless!
- Really?

514
00:44:17,683 --> 00:44:19,583
Melt it down for the jewels.

515
00:44:42,608 --> 00:44:44,439
What's the boy doing?

516
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:48,208
No, you might kill a bird!

517
00:44:51,484 --> 00:44:53,418
Hey! Over here!

518
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,527
I wouldn't do that if I were you!

519
00:45:05,565 --> 00:45:06,930
Get to the tunnel!

520
00:45:08,768 --> 00:45:10,736
Look at this! That's it!

521
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,900
No more fermented goat's milk
after the third race! You hear me?

522
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,998
Get after him! Come on!

523
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:16,835
- The gate!
- Get him!

524
00:45:17,977 --> 00:45:19,308
Stop!

525
00:45:24,517 --> 00:45:26,109
Lift the lever! It'll open the gate!

526
00:45:26,152 --> 00:45:27,585
- Give me the dagger!
- What? You're...

527
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,212
This is not the time! Just lift that lever!

528
00:45:29,255 --> 00:45:30,415
Give me the dagger!

529
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:36,861
Don't think it didn't cross my mind.

530
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:43,661
Move, Princess!

531
00:45:43,903 --> 00:45:45,302
Persian!

532
00:45:45,371 --> 00:45:46,429
Dastan!

533
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:49,365
Persian!

534
00:45:58,751 --> 00:46:01,515
Looking for this? Key?

535
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:06,456
Next time, you!

536
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:19,370
They've all come
for my father's funeral.

537
00:46:29,982 --> 00:46:32,849
There are 100 Persian soldiers
watching that gate.

538
00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:35,547
Maybe more.
If you want to stay close to this dagger,

539
00:46:35,588 --> 00:46:37,317
you're going to have
to help me into Avrat.

540
00:46:42,862 --> 00:46:44,921
All these foreign dignitaries,

541
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:47,190
I'm guessing you know a few.

542
00:47:04,016 --> 00:47:06,382
Couldn't you have found
somebody lighter?

543
00:47:06,919 --> 00:47:09,114
The Mughals of the Hindu Kush
are a noble people.

544
00:47:09,155 --> 00:47:10,816
You should be honored.

545
00:47:11,757 --> 00:47:13,418
Oh, yes. Terribly.

546
00:47:21,867 --> 00:47:23,334
Dastan, where's the dagger?

547
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:25,530
You're welcome to search me for it.

548
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:27,505
You'll have to be very thorough.

549
00:47:40,252 --> 00:47:43,187
Tus isn't here.
He must still be in Alamut.

550
00:47:45,658 --> 00:47:46,750
The sand that fuels the dagger,

551
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:48,919
there's more of it hidden
somewhere in Alamut, isn't there?

552
00:47:50,296 --> 00:47:51,923
That's why Tus stays there.

553
00:47:52,098 --> 00:47:54,464
That's what he's got our army
searching for.

554
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,695
I have to get a message
to my uncle to meet me.

555
00:47:57,403 --> 00:47:58,700
That's impossible.

556
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:01,699
Difficult, not impossible.

557
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:03,099
Or more proof you're insane.

558
00:49:03,135 --> 00:49:05,126
Then why do you look so impressed?

559
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:07,371
Out of the way! Make way!

560
00:49:12,611 --> 00:49:13,669
- Turn around.
- What?

561
00:49:13,712 --> 00:49:14,736
Turn around!

562
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:29,425
You used to buy those for me
when I was a boy.

563
00:49:29,762 --> 00:49:32,230
You used to spit the seeds at Garsiv.

564
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:36,026
You should not have
brought me here, Dastan.

565
00:49:36,235 --> 00:49:37,532
I had no choice, Uncle.

566
00:49:37,903 --> 00:49:38,927
Follow me.

567
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,859
I didn't kill Father.

568
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:05,221
You know I would never do
such a thing.

569
00:50:05,264 --> 00:50:07,164
Your actions speak otherwise.

570
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,159
But I had no choice but to flee.

571
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,435
Tus gave me that cloak.

572
00:50:13,606 --> 00:50:15,437
- He was the one who poisoned it.
- Dastan.

573
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:16,964
Well, he's not here, is he?

574
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:19,239
At his father's funeral.
Instead, he remains in Alamut.

575
00:50:19,278 --> 00:50:21,644
Our allies will see
our invasion was just.

576
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,012
The search for
Alamut's weapons forges is important.

577
00:50:24,049 --> 00:50:26,108
Yes, but not if there are none.

578
00:50:26,785 --> 00:50:28,685
The invasion of Alamut was a lie.

579
00:50:28,988 --> 00:50:31,786
Tus is after power.
That's why he murdered Father.

580
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:33,920
And now he searches not for weapons,

581
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:37,622
but for the sand
that fuels a mystical device.

582
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:41,226
This is why you brought me here,
Dastan? Mystical devices?

583
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:42,427
Do you remember, after the battle,

584
00:50:42,468 --> 00:50:44,493
you stopped Tus
from taking the dagger I'd won?

585
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:48,773
That dagger is the reason
he invaded Alamut.

586
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:53,410
This dagger, you have it with you?

587
00:50:56,315 --> 00:50:57,543
Yes.

588
00:51:03,355 --> 00:51:05,050
It has incredible powers.

589
00:51:09,061 --> 00:51:11,325
Is this some sort of a joke, Dastan?

590
00:51:13,132 --> 00:51:15,100
What? No, it was in there.

591
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:17,668
Then where's your so-called evidence?

592
00:51:19,405 --> 00:51:20,929
Tamina.

593
00:51:21,573 --> 00:51:22,597
I...

594
00:51:29,348 --> 00:51:30,781
Your hands are burned.

595
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:32,708
Yes.

596
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:36,988
From trying to pull
the poisoned cloak off your father.

597
00:51:39,024 --> 00:51:41,720
- Is something wrong, Dastan?
- No, no.

598
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,058
You're certain?
You know you can trust me, boy.

599
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:49,828
It's just that

600
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:52,828
Tus is my brother.

601
00:51:53,372 --> 00:51:55,306
How could he betray me like this?

602
00:51:55,341 --> 00:51:57,639
I can't say, Dastan. Perhaps he

603
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,373
never respected you as you deserve,

604
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,243
only saw you as someone he could use.

605
00:52:02,281 --> 00:52:04,078
Someone to keep his wine glass filled?

606
00:52:04,116 --> 00:52:06,141
My service to your father was different.

607
00:52:07,252 --> 00:52:09,447
We shared the same blood, Dastan.

608
00:52:09,688 --> 00:52:13,055
How many times did Father speak
of you saving him from that lion?

609
00:52:14,393 --> 00:52:17,123
- That was his favorite story.
- One of many, yes.

610
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:18,990
No, that was his favorite.

611
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:21,397
I'm afraid you're
speaking in riddles, Dastan.

612
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,498
Wait! Dastan!

613
00:52:58,604 --> 00:52:59,628
Over here!

614
00:53:20,426 --> 00:53:21,893
Murderer!

615
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:31,862
I didn't kill Father!

616
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:38,242
Out of the way! Get out of the way!

617
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,168
What are you going to do now?

618
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:33,148
Where is he?

619
00:55:33,592 --> 00:55:34,786
Where is he?

620
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:36,821
Hey.

621
00:55:56,682 --> 00:55:57,979
Garsiv.

622
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:01,046
I didn't kill Father.

623
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:03,286
Then God will pardon you

624
00:56:03,789 --> 00:56:05,120
after your head rolls.

625
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:17,795
Not fighting with sticks anymore,
little brother.

626
00:56:28,647 --> 00:56:29,671
That's all you got?

627
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,028
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

628
00:56:50,102 --> 00:56:51,592
<i>I thought you were staying in Alamut.</i>

629
00:56:52,337 --> 00:56:54,305
Tell me about Dastan, Uncle.

630
00:56:56,241 --> 00:56:58,471
Dastan came to Avrat to kill me.

631
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,445
In the marketplace. I just got away.

632
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:05,973
Tus, my death would weaken
your young reign.

633
00:57:07,252 --> 00:57:09,447
Dastan hopes to stir a rebellion.

634
00:57:09,488 --> 00:57:11,820
- He wants the throne?
- I fear so, my lord.

635
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:19,891
Putting Dastan on trial would
only give him a stage for his sedition.

636
00:57:20,198 --> 00:57:23,827
My advice would be to avoid a trial.

637
00:57:24,636 --> 00:57:26,968
Don't bring him back to Nasaf alive.

638
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:39,008
Whatever Dastan's crimes,

639
00:57:39,318 --> 00:57:42,378
a public trial will best communicate
the king I hope to be.

640
00:57:43,288 --> 00:57:45,756
Strong, honoring the rule of law.

641
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:49,593
We are not savages.

642
00:57:49,861 --> 00:57:51,761
You grow more a king every day.

643
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:56,032
Dastan must be found.
He must be brought to justice.

644
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:07,703
I need to speak with our guests.

645
00:58:07,746 --> 00:58:11,113
Oh, about them, my lord.
Their practices are unusual.

646
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:14,319
The servants have seen things,
heard strange sounds.

647
00:58:14,353 --> 00:58:16,947
Last week, one of the horses vanished.

648
00:58:16,988 --> 00:58:19,616
Well, just make sure
the servants keep their mouths shut.

649
00:58:19,658 --> 00:58:21,148
Or I promise you,

650
00:58:22,828 --> 00:58:24,420
they will vanish, as well.

651
00:59:28,693 --> 00:59:30,558
I have another task for you, Hassansin,

652
00:59:30,595 --> 00:59:33,029
but you'll have to be quick.
Your prey has a head start.

653
00:59:33,098 --> 00:59:34,895
You brought what I requested?

654
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:48,377
These practices,
they don't interfere with your skills?

655
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,005
In the trance
we can see visions of our future.

656
00:59:51,983 --> 00:59:53,143
<i>Visions of death.</i>

657
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,381
A destiny

658
00:59:58,423 --> 00:59:59,720
and a curse.

659
01:00:06,631 --> 01:00:08,758
In that trance, we can find anything,

660
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,234
including your nephew, Prince Dastan.

661
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,661
Then I hope you shall see more death,

662
01:00:15,173 --> 01:00:16,435
soon.

663
01:00:54,179 --> 01:00:56,545
Get down! It's a Persian patrol!

664
01:00:59,484 --> 01:01:01,145
Garsiv.

665
01:01:09,094 --> 01:01:10,755
What aren't you telling me?

666
01:01:13,098 --> 01:01:14,588
The tribesmen left.

667
01:01:15,233 --> 01:01:18,031
Maybe they tired of your penchant
for lies and backstabbing.

668
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:20,230
I had no choice but to leave you.

669
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:23,030
I take it your uncle didn't listen.

670
01:01:23,775 --> 01:01:26,869
It wasn't Tus that killed my father.
It was Nizam.

671
01:01:28,013 --> 01:01:30,345
- Your uncle?
- His hands were burned.

672
01:01:31,249 --> 01:01:33,615
He said it happened trying to pull off
the cloak that killed my father.

673
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:35,051
I've gone over and over it in my mind.

674
01:01:35,086 --> 01:01:38,021
He never touched the cloak.
He must have handled it before.

675
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:42,718
It was Nizam who poisoned it.

676
01:01:43,695 --> 01:01:46,687
What good does turning back
a few moments of time do my uncle?

677
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:48,129
None.

678
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:51,227
He murdered my father
for more than just a dagger.

679
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:53,328
What aren't you telling me?

680
01:01:53,371 --> 01:01:56,033
You know, you've got quick hands.

681
01:01:56,074 --> 01:01:57,439
But so do I.

682
01:01:57,475 --> 01:01:59,739
If you want it back,
you tell me everything.

683
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:01,939
No more games, no more lies.

684
01:02:13,091 --> 01:02:14,786
Can we get out of here?

685
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,029
Only a princess would think
she could outrun a sandstorm.

686
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:33,872
Nizam's coming to kill us.
He needs me dead.

687
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:36,510
I need to know why.

688
01:02:41,786 --> 01:02:45,153
In Alamut rests the beating heart
of all life on Earth,

689
01:02:46,891 --> 01:02:48,950
the Sandglass of the Gods.

690
01:02:50,795 --> 01:02:52,763
Long ago,
the gods looked down on man

691
01:02:52,797 --> 01:02:54,958
and saw nothing
but greed and treachery.

692
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:58,659
And so they sent
a great sandstorm to destroy all,

693
01:02:58,703 --> 01:03:01,137
wipe clean the face of the Earth.

694
01:03:01,272 --> 01:03:05,504
<i>But one young girl begged the gods
to give mankind another chance,</i>

695
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:07,778
<i>offering her life in exchange.</i>

696
01:03:08,647 --> 01:03:10,774
Seeing the purity within,

697
01:03:11,616 --> 01:03:14,779
the gods were reminded
of man's potential for good.

698
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:17,583
And so they swept the sands
into the Sandglass.

699
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:36,867
The dagger was given to the girl
who saved man,

700
01:03:37,876 --> 01:03:39,969
<i>making her the first Guardian.</i>

701
01:03:40,245 --> 01:03:43,681
The dagger blade is the only thing
that can pierce the Sandglass

702
01:03:43,715 --> 01:03:45,580
and remove the Sands of Time,

703
01:03:46,017 --> 01:03:48,247
but the handle only holds one minute.

704
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,718
What if one were to place the dagger
in the Sandglass

705
01:03:50,755 --> 01:03:52,848
and press the jewel button
at the same time?

706
01:03:53,024 --> 01:03:54,616
Sand would flow through endlessly.

707
01:03:54,659 --> 01:03:56,354
You could turn back time
as far as you like.

708
01:03:56,394 --> 01:03:58,259
Yes, but it is forbidden.

709
01:04:05,403 --> 01:04:07,337
When my father was a boy,

710
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:10,198
Nizam saved his life hunting.

711
01:04:11,676 --> 01:04:14,839
<i>One day, the two princes
were stalking a beautiful buck.</i>

712
01:04:15,447 --> 01:04:18,314
<i>But they were unaware
of a lioness stalking them.</i>

713
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:20,444
<i>Nizam saved Sharaman.</i>

714
01:04:20,785 --> 01:04:24,277
My father told us the story
over and over again.

715
01:04:24,355 --> 01:04:26,084
I don't understand.

716
01:04:27,092 --> 01:04:30,391
Nizam wishes to go back in time
and undo what he did.

717
01:04:30,695 --> 01:04:33,129
Not save my father. Let him die.

718
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:35,857
Then he would be king for a lifetime,

719
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:39,159
and my brothers would never be born.

720
01:04:46,311 --> 01:04:47,801
Storm's passed.

721
01:05:16,441 --> 01:05:20,400
Dastan, the sands contained within
the Sandglass are incredibly powerful.

722
01:05:24,549 --> 01:05:27,985
Opening the dagger while
it's inside the glass breaks the seal.

723
01:05:29,154 --> 01:05:31,145
That would destroy the Sandglass,

724
01:05:31,189 --> 01:05:33,020
causing it to crack and shatter.

725
01:05:33,158 --> 01:05:35,718
The Sands of Time
would no longer be contained.

726
01:05:36,628 --> 01:05:39,563
<i>And they would carry
the gods' wrath with them once more,</i>

727
01:05:39,597 --> 01:05:41,428
<i>destroying everything in their path.</i>

728
01:05:45,436 --> 01:05:48,599
And all of mankind would pay
for Nizam's treachery.

729
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:52,671
<i>This is all that would be left of us.</i>

730
01:05:54,546 --> 01:05:57,982
The secret Guardian Temple
outside Alamut is a sanctuary,

731
01:05:58,016 --> 01:06:00,177
the one place
the dagger can be hidden safely,

732
01:06:00,218 --> 01:06:02,413
the only way to stop this Armageddon.

733
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:06,654
That's the truth, Dastan.

734
01:06:08,526 --> 01:06:10,221
Give me back the dagger

735
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:13,426
so that I can take it there.

736
01:06:16,301 --> 01:06:17,996
I can't do that.

737
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,398
I'm coming with you.

738
01:06:24,209 --> 01:06:25,767
You're going to help me?

739
01:06:28,112 --> 01:06:30,740
We could sit here and chat,
or you could get on the horse.

740
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:48,796
Our journey is blessed.

741
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:52,795
We'll stop for water and push
for the mountain pass by nightfall.

742
01:06:54,305 --> 01:06:56,500
You enjoy telling me what to do.

743
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:58,441
Only because you're so good
at following orders.

744
01:06:58,476 --> 01:07:00,671
Yeah. Don't press your luck.

745
01:07:14,926 --> 01:07:16,325
Persian!

746
01:07:17,095 --> 01:07:19,563
We parted under
such rushed circumstances,

747
01:07:19,597 --> 01:07:21,497
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

748
01:07:23,368 --> 01:07:25,859
We've been tracking you for a week!

749
01:07:25,904 --> 01:07:29,237
That little riot you started,
it went on for two days!

750
01:07:30,975 --> 01:07:32,567
My beloved racetrack,

751
01:07:33,544 --> 01:07:35,978
all washed away like footprints in sand.

752
01:07:36,547 --> 01:07:38,572
You see Anita there? Hmm?
Look at her.

753
01:07:38,616 --> 01:07:40,709
She's all that's left
of my gaming empire.

754
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:43,585
And no matter your skills
as a promoter,

755
01:07:44,289 --> 01:07:46,814
you can't organize an ostrich race

756
01:07:47,225 --> 01:07:49,216
with just one ostrich!

757
01:07:49,494 --> 01:07:50,620
Am I right?

758
01:07:50,662 --> 01:07:51,686
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

759
01:07:52,063 --> 01:07:53,826
Yes, sir. Come with me.

760
01:08:01,172 --> 01:08:04,573
Did you know that ostriches
have suicidal tendencies?

761
01:08:05,977 --> 01:08:07,467
Look at this poor thing.

762
01:08:08,413 --> 01:08:10,677
She used to be a grand champion.

763
01:08:10,915 --> 01:08:13,145
Now I have to watch her night and day

764
01:08:13,184 --> 01:08:15,345
to make sure
she doesn't do anything stupid.

765
01:08:21,893 --> 01:08:22,951
So, it occurred to me

766
01:08:22,994 --> 01:08:26,430
the only way to recoup
my tragic losses was to track down

767
01:08:26,464 --> 01:08:27,658
- the two young lovers...
- Sheikh Amar.

768
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:29,758
...who cast this dark cloud upon me.

769
01:08:29,801 --> 01:08:32,531
Yes! I'm going to need
the price on your heads!

770
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:35,164
Your brother will be
very pleased to see...

771
01:08:38,443 --> 01:08:40,172
It's sand dervishes, Persian.

772
01:08:40,211 --> 01:08:41,644
They're common as camel turd
in the desert.

773
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,239
- No, Sheikh Amar, listen to me!
- I'd rather not.

774
01:08:45,783 --> 01:08:47,478
- Nice knife.
- Noble Sheikh,

775
01:08:47,518 --> 01:08:49,418
we are on a sacred journey
to the Temple...

776
01:08:49,587 --> 01:08:50,645
Temple, the Temple.

777
01:08:50,688 --> 01:08:53,213
There's nothing more sacred
than Persian gold!

778
01:09:41,706 --> 01:09:43,401
Give me the dagger.
There are too many of them.

779
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:49,279
You can't kill them all.
You want to live? Give me the dagger!

780
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:10,065
Give me the dagger!

781
01:10:24,782 --> 01:10:26,215
Persian, how...

782
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,717
How did you do that?

783
01:10:30,421 --> 01:10:31,581
Instinct.

784
01:10:34,358 --> 01:10:35,586
What?

785
01:10:45,169 --> 01:10:46,363
We have to get out of here.

786
01:10:50,007 --> 01:10:51,838
What happened last night?

787
01:10:51,943 --> 01:10:54,104
Those vipers were controlled
by Hassansins.

788
01:10:54,145 --> 01:10:55,271
Hassansins?

789
01:10:55,313 --> 01:10:57,474
For years, they were the covert
killing force of the Persian kings

790
01:10:57,515 --> 01:10:59,449
until my father
ordered them disbanded.

791
01:10:59,484 --> 01:11:01,975
Nizam must have disobeyed
my father's orders

792
01:11:02,019 --> 01:11:03,418
and kept them intact.

793
01:11:03,454 --> 01:11:05,922
This secret government killing activity,

794
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:07,714
that's why I don't pay taxes.

795
01:11:07,758 --> 01:11:08,986
We can't stop.

796
01:11:09,026 --> 01:11:11,153
Well, perhaps you can't, but we can.

797
01:11:11,195 --> 01:11:13,163
We could use your help
getting to the Temple.

798
01:11:14,065 --> 01:11:16,465
By crossing the Hindu Kush
with a storm blowing?

799
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:19,095
You attract trouble
like flies around rotting mango,

800
01:11:19,137 --> 01:11:21,469
- and you're insane...
- There's gold at the Temple.

801
01:11:22,006 --> 01:11:23,997
More than 10 horses can carry.

802
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:26,006
Tax free.

803
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:27,873
Sir!

804
01:11:57,475 --> 01:11:59,739
Do you have any idea
where you're going?

805
01:11:59,777 --> 01:12:02,405
I memorized this path as a child.

806
01:12:02,446 --> 01:12:04,243
Every princess must.

807
01:12:04,749 --> 01:12:06,046
It's sacred.

808
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,553
It's here!

809
01:12:19,697 --> 01:12:20,994
The sanctuary.

810
01:12:21,032 --> 01:12:23,557
The one place the dagger
can be hidden safely.

811
01:12:23,935 --> 01:12:26,802
I was expecting
golden statues, waterfalls.

812
01:12:31,676 --> 01:12:35,009
Give me back the dagger
so that I can take it there.

813
01:12:53,297 --> 01:12:55,663
Don't cut yourself, Princess.

814
01:13:01,372 --> 01:13:03,135
Hey! Here!

815
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:09,404
Not long dead.
Last night maybe. Tortured first.

816
01:13:10,581 --> 01:13:13,448
- Hassansin.
- Nizam knows this place.

817
01:13:13,884 --> 01:13:15,374
All dead.

818
01:13:18,956 --> 01:13:20,548
The entire village. My gold?

819
01:13:20,591 --> 01:13:21,717
Where are you going?

820
01:13:21,759 --> 01:13:23,624
There is only one way to stop all of this.

821
01:13:23,661 --> 01:13:25,629
- What? What?
- To make sure the dagger is safe.

822
01:13:25,663 --> 01:13:27,722
The Temple holds the stone
the dagger came from.

823
01:13:27,765 --> 01:13:30,233
What Temple?
This is a pile of stones and rocks!

824
01:13:30,268 --> 01:13:31,929
The first thing we learned,
if all else fails,

825
01:13:31,969 --> 01:13:33,402
put the dagger back into the stone.

826
01:13:33,437 --> 01:13:35,997
The stone will envelop it.
Pull it into the mountain,

827
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,507
returning it to the gods.

828
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,814
The original promise

829
01:13:48,686 --> 01:13:50,313
must be paid.

830
01:13:51,055 --> 01:13:52,454
What promise?

831
01:13:53,624 --> 01:13:56,354
The gods must take back the life
they spared.

832
01:13:56,994 --> 01:13:58,962
That'll mean you'll die.

833
01:14:09,907 --> 01:14:11,636
Stay there! Stay there!

834
01:14:12,076 --> 01:14:14,101
- Stay there!
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

835
01:14:14,145 --> 01:14:15,703
Give me your sword!

836
01:14:15,746 --> 01:14:17,737
Give me your sword,
or do you forsake even that honor?

837
01:14:17,782 --> 01:14:18,806
There are bodies down there.

838
01:14:18,849 --> 01:14:21,909
Murdered by Hassansins,
on Nizam's order! He's the traitor!

839
01:14:21,952 --> 01:14:23,544
Hassansins no longer exist!

840
01:14:23,821 --> 01:14:25,186
You always thought you were so clever.

841
01:14:25,222 --> 01:14:26,849
- No, this is no trick, Garsiv.
- Sir!

842
01:14:28,059 --> 01:14:30,220
All dead inside, sir. More in the village.

843
01:14:30,895 --> 01:14:32,556
- There's one in there and...
- Stay there!

844
01:14:37,935 --> 01:14:39,334
Nizam wants me dead.

845
01:14:39,704 --> 01:14:42,867
Wants me silenced.
A trial would be too public.

846
01:14:47,645 --> 01:14:49,909
You know this?
He said as much, didn't he?

847
01:14:50,081 --> 01:14:52,072
I know it hasn't been easy
between us, Garsiv,

848
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:53,840
but still,

849
01:14:54,218 --> 01:14:55,310
we are brothers.

850
01:14:55,686 --> 01:14:57,517
Touching words with my sword
at your throat.

851
01:14:57,555 --> 01:15:00,456
You often questioned why Father
spent so much time in prayer.

852
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:02,759
Before he died, he told me
that the bond between brothers

853
01:15:02,793 --> 01:15:04,886
is the sword that defends our empire.

854
01:15:04,929 --> 01:15:07,625
He was praying that
that sword remain strong.

855
01:15:07,665 --> 01:15:09,599
Why would I go into Avrat
for Father's funeral

856
01:15:09,633 --> 01:15:11,498
when I knew it was so dangerous?

857
01:15:19,944 --> 01:15:21,707
Nizam recommended your death.

858
01:15:22,179 --> 01:15:24,647
Tus disagreed,
ordered you brought back alive.

859
01:15:24,682 --> 01:15:26,115
Nizam wants me dead,

860
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:29,676
and he's hired the Hassansins
to make sure that that does happen.

861
01:15:30,254 --> 01:15:32,449
He's afraid of what I might say

862
01:15:33,758 --> 01:15:35,487
and who I might tell.

863
01:15:40,197 --> 01:15:41,596
Tell me, brother.

864
01:15:45,236 --> 01:15:46,260
Garsiv?

865
01:15:51,675 --> 01:15:52,733
Wait. Garsiv!

866
01:15:54,078 --> 01:15:55,272
Garsiv.

867
01:15:57,848 --> 01:15:59,008
Hassansins!

868
01:16:18,869 --> 01:16:20,097
Shut up! Shut up!

869
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:33,776
Protect the dagger!

870
01:16:51,202 --> 01:16:52,726
Persian! Behind you!

871
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:04,272
Tamina!

872
01:17:05,649 --> 01:17:06,707
Tamina!

873
01:17:07,051 --> 01:17:08,678
Forget them! Throw these!

874
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:11,180
Find her!

875
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:22,390
Hey! Hey, over here!

876
01:17:22,433 --> 01:17:24,367
You know what they say
about men with big swords?

877
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:41,108
Tamina! Let me do it.

878
01:17:42,987 --> 01:17:45,547
Only a Guardian can return the dagger.

879
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,320
This isn't something
you can do, Dastan.

880
01:17:50,828 --> 01:17:52,295
I'm ready for this.

881
01:17:54,665 --> 01:17:55,859
I'm not.

882
01:18:10,714 --> 01:18:12,147
Tamina!

883
01:19:04,335 --> 01:19:05,996
Out! Enough! Out!

884
01:19:25,289 --> 01:19:26,347
Garsiv!

885
01:19:27,024 --> 01:19:28,048
Garsiv.

886
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:30,059
Dastan, I'm sorry.

887
01:19:34,431 --> 01:19:36,092
Save the empire.

888
01:19:38,902 --> 01:19:40,392
Brother.

889
01:19:41,171 --> 01:19:42,536
Brother.

890
01:19:46,176 --> 01:19:47,643
Where is the dagger?

891
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:49,907
It's gone.

892
01:19:51,715 --> 01:19:53,910
"Protect the dagger,
no matter the consequences. "

893
01:19:53,951 --> 01:19:56,010
That was my sacred calling.

894
01:19:57,054 --> 01:19:58,817
That was my destiny.

895
01:20:05,295 --> 01:20:07,729
We make our own destiny, Princess.

896
01:20:09,033 --> 01:20:10,432
We'll get it back.

897
01:20:43,434 --> 01:20:45,595
We're gonna need another horse.

898
01:20:48,338 --> 01:20:49,828
Where will you go?

899
01:20:50,441 --> 01:20:51,601
To Alamut.

900
01:20:54,678 --> 01:20:57,545
Nizam will use that dagger
to pierce the Sandglass,

901
01:20:57,581 --> 01:20:59,071
and he has to be stopped.

902
01:20:59,116 --> 01:21:01,607
"And he has to be stopped.
He has to be stopped. "

903
01:21:01,652 --> 01:21:02,949
That's good...

904
01:21:05,589 --> 01:21:06,920
What?

905
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:10,589
A knife thrower with a conscience.

906
01:21:31,715 --> 01:21:33,876
Our friends in the palace say
the Persians have broken through

907
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:35,748
to the first level of the tunnels.

908
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:38,583
They'll reach the Sandglass
within hours.

909
01:21:38,655 --> 01:21:40,953
Nizam's keeping the dagger
in the High Temple,

910
01:21:40,991 --> 01:21:44,893
guarded by some sort of demon
covered in spikes.

911
01:21:45,195 --> 01:21:47,254
The Hassansin that killed my brother.

912
01:21:47,297 --> 01:21:50,198
It's the only thing that stands
between us and the dagger.

913
01:21:51,101 --> 01:21:53,661
No man can stand
within 20 yards of him and live.

914
01:21:54,204 --> 01:21:56,672
Some don't need to get that close.

915
01:22:17,528 --> 01:22:19,223
Spare some water, sire?

916
01:22:28,472 --> 01:22:29,939
You sure about this?

917
01:22:30,941 --> 01:22:32,374
- I owe the boy.
- What?

918
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:35,777
You're a Ngbaka!
Scourge of the Numidian plain.

919
01:22:35,813 --> 01:22:38,441
Me? I'm a slightly
dishonorable entrepreneur.

920
01:22:38,482 --> 01:22:41,815
This nobility business
is not the cloth we're cut from.

921
01:22:41,852 --> 01:22:43,046
Hurry!

922
01:22:43,287 --> 01:22:46,085
My friend, has anyone ever told you

923
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:49,288
that you talk too much?

924
01:22:56,099 --> 01:22:57,157
Come on.

925
01:25:45,535 --> 01:25:47,400
Have I told you about the Ngbaka?

926
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:50,866
Yes, you have.

927
01:25:50,907 --> 01:25:52,841
I hope your brother
listens to you, Persian.

928
01:26:02,519 --> 01:26:04,282
He's here.

929
01:26:04,554 --> 01:26:05,816
Seal every gate!

930
01:26:06,323 --> 01:26:07,347
Find him!

931
01:26:41,525 --> 01:26:43,618
- It's clear.
- Dastan, I don't think...

932
01:26:45,328 --> 01:26:47,319
I don't think you should do this.

933
01:26:47,964 --> 01:26:49,556
Is that concern I hear?

934
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:52,733
- Caution.
- Sprinkled with concern.

935
01:26:53,003 --> 01:26:54,971
You flatter yourself, Prince.

936
01:26:55,505 --> 01:26:58,099
And you used to be
a better liar, Princess.

937
01:26:58,909 --> 01:27:01,104
Perhaps I'm out of practice.

938
01:27:02,512 --> 01:27:04,810
This won't be the last time
we'll be together.

939
01:27:15,258 --> 01:27:17,954
- Where is the dagger?
- You Persian bureaucrats.

940
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,961
Such soft hands.

941
01:27:28,872 --> 01:27:30,965
It's been found, my lord.

942
01:27:31,508 --> 01:27:32,770
The Sandglass?

943
01:27:34,778 --> 01:27:36,746
I don't have the dagger.

944
01:27:38,715 --> 01:27:40,114
Leave me.

945
01:27:41,284 --> 01:27:42,342
Hello, Tus.

946
01:27:43,353 --> 01:27:44,479
Dastan!

947
01:27:46,556 --> 01:27:48,148
- We need to talk.
- Then talk.

948
01:27:48,859 --> 01:27:51,054
- Alone.
- Wait outside the chamber.

949
01:27:51,928 --> 01:27:53,759
Now!

950
01:27:55,699 --> 01:27:57,360
We are brothers, are we not?

951
01:27:59,369 --> 01:28:01,132
The robe that killed Father
was poisoned by Nizam.

952
01:28:01,171 --> 01:28:02,570
Nizam? You're mad.

953
01:28:02,606 --> 01:28:04,540
Who gave you the robe, Tus?

954
01:28:05,041 --> 01:28:06,633
Who gave you the robe?

955
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:09,435
You trust him, as did I.

956
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,041
But Alamut wasn't supplying
our enemies with weapons.

957
01:28:12,115 --> 01:28:13,241
Nizam lied to us.

958
01:28:13,283 --> 01:28:15,251
Why would he do such a thing?
What could he gain?

959
01:28:15,652 --> 01:28:17,643
Listen to me carefully.

960
01:28:18,054 --> 01:28:20,386
Beneath the streets of the city
lies an ancient force.

961
01:28:20,423 --> 01:28:23,392
A container holding
the fabled Sands of Time.

962
01:28:24,161 --> 01:28:25,958
Nizam wishes to use it
to corrupt history.

963
01:28:25,996 --> 01:28:28,157
He wants to turn back time
and make himself king.

964
01:28:29,533 --> 01:28:31,330
"Sands of Time"?

965
01:28:31,768 --> 01:28:34,430
- Heresies, Dastan. Pagan madness.
- No.

966
01:28:34,504 --> 01:28:36,972
I've seen its power
with my own eyes, Tus.

967
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:38,838
And Nizam discovered
its resting place.

968
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:41,105
If we don't stop him,
our world could end.

969
01:28:41,645 --> 01:28:43,135
If you're going to kill me,

970
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,279
best you do it now.

971
01:28:51,254 --> 01:28:52,744
This is no ordinary dagger.

972
01:28:53,957 --> 01:28:55,618
You press the jewel on its hilt

973
01:28:56,726 --> 01:28:58,091
and you will see.

974
01:29:00,463 --> 01:29:03,193
I should have had the strength
to do this before we invaded the city.

975
01:29:03,366 --> 01:29:05,231
What are you talking about?

976
01:29:05,669 --> 01:29:07,296
To act on what I know is right,

977
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:09,629
no matter the consequences.

978
01:29:21,017 --> 01:29:23,952
- The soldiers remain on...
- Stay where you are!

979
01:29:30,894 --> 01:29:32,691
He took his own life.

980
01:29:32,729 --> 01:29:36,927
Then God have mercy on the traitor,
for he chose the path of the coward.

981
01:29:37,901 --> 01:29:40,335
We both know
Dastan was many things,

982
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:42,201
but not a coward.

983
01:29:45,609 --> 01:29:47,770
<i>"This is no ordinary dagger.</i>

984
01:29:47,811 --> 01:29:51,144
<i>"Press the jewel on its hilt
and you will see. "</i>

985
01:30:12,202 --> 01:30:13,794
...no matter the consequences.

986
01:30:14,671 --> 01:30:16,138
Stop!

987
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,201
A moment ago
you died before my eyes.

988
01:30:21,544 --> 01:30:22,806
You pressed it.

989
01:30:23,613 --> 01:30:25,376
How did you know I would?

990
01:30:26,483 --> 01:30:28,508
Because we are brothers.

991
01:30:32,989 --> 01:30:34,650
On the day we left for war,

992
01:30:34,691 --> 01:30:38,388
our father told me a true king
considers the advice of counsel,

993
01:30:39,229 --> 01:30:41,493
but always listens to his heart.

994
01:30:43,166 --> 01:30:46,101
You shouldn't have had to go so far
for me to believe you.

995
01:30:46,202 --> 01:30:48,636
Your Majesty,
the soldiers tell me that...

996
01:30:51,341 --> 01:30:53,741
I see that Dastan has indeed returned.

997
01:30:56,813 --> 01:30:58,405
Tus, remember what I told you!

998
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:05,947
No! A moment.

999
01:31:07,490 --> 01:31:10,789
Poor Tus. So eager for the crown.

1000
01:31:12,562 --> 01:31:16,726
And you, Dastan, always charging in.

1001
01:31:16,933 --> 01:31:18,594
So desperate to prove

1002
01:31:18,635 --> 01:31:23,595
you're more than something
the King scraped off the streets.

1003
01:31:25,241 --> 01:31:27,141
What a glorious mess we are.

1004
01:31:29,312 --> 01:31:31,177
It seems the bond between brothers

1005
01:31:31,815 --> 01:31:34,648
is no longer the sword
that defends our empire.

1006
01:31:35,785 --> 01:31:36,809
Yes!

1007
01:31:59,943 --> 01:32:02,173
He was one of us.

1008
01:32:04,447 --> 01:32:06,312
He was a priest of the Temple.

1009
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:10,076
That's how Nizam discovered
the existence of the Sandglass.

1010
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,982
They've corrupted the Guardians.
Infected us.

1011
01:32:13,723 --> 01:32:15,554
We're no longer pure.

1012
01:32:17,227 --> 01:32:18,717
We must hurry.

1013
01:32:27,137 --> 01:32:28,399
Pulley.

1014
01:32:28,905 --> 01:32:29,997
The pulley!

1015
01:32:30,373 --> 01:32:31,397
Now!

1016
01:32:34,711 --> 01:32:37,202
The Guardians built passageways
underneath the city

1017
01:32:37,247 --> 01:32:38,976
as secret access to the Sandglass.

1018
01:32:39,015 --> 01:32:41,848
If we move fast enough,
we can get there before Nizam.

1019
01:33:08,244 --> 01:33:10,269
That will lead us down
to the Sandglass chamber.

1020
01:33:12,081 --> 01:33:13,673
There is only one safe path.

1021
01:33:15,018 --> 01:33:16,042
Faster!

1022
01:33:35,171 --> 01:33:37,139
Follow in my footsteps.

1023
01:33:40,076 --> 01:33:42,772
Nothing can touch the surface
other than where I step.

1024
01:34:05,068 --> 01:34:06,399
Run, Dastan!

1025
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,294
Run!

1026
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:18,579
Dastan!

1027
01:37:05,014 --> 01:37:06,038
Nizam!

1028
01:37:08,651 --> 01:37:10,346
You murdered your own family.

1029
01:37:10,386 --> 01:37:11,910
Sharaman was your brother!

1030
01:37:12,288 --> 01:37:13,653
And my curse.

1031
01:37:16,759 --> 01:37:17,987
I looked up to you.

1032
01:37:21,297 --> 01:37:22,559
Dastan!

1033
01:37:22,598 --> 01:37:26,694
I never understood why my brother
brought trash into the palace.

1034
01:37:27,003 --> 01:37:28,903
Enjoy the gutter, Dastan.

1035
01:37:29,539 --> 01:37:31,336
It's where you'll stay under my reign.

1036
01:37:42,552 --> 01:37:43,576
Tamina!

1037
01:37:45,254 --> 01:37:48,587
Nizam! Don't use the dagger
to undo your past!

1038
01:37:48,624 --> 01:37:50,819
- It will unleash...
- Unleash what?

1039
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:53,158
God's wrath? Hell itself?

1040
01:37:58,434 --> 01:37:59,458
Don't do this!

1041
01:38:15,284 --> 01:38:18,549
Stop him! If the glass shatters,
the world dies with it.

1042
01:38:19,889 --> 01:38:23,757
It's not my destiny, it's yours.
It always has been.

1043
01:38:24,794 --> 01:38:26,728
- Let me go.
- I won't.

1044
01:38:27,764 --> 01:38:30,392
- Let me go.
- I'm not letting you go!

1045
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,428
I wish we could have been together.

1046
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:35,694
No!

1047
01:38:36,939 --> 01:38:38,668
No! No!

1048
01:38:41,444 --> 01:38:42,934
- Dastan!
- No!

1049
01:38:43,412 --> 01:38:46,506
Tamina! No!

1050
01:38:51,988 --> 01:38:53,353
No!

1051
01:38:54,891 --> 01:38:55,915
No!

1052
01:39:16,779 --> 01:39:18,508
<i>Dastan!</i>

1053
01:39:19,448 --> 01:39:20,938
<i>Tamina!</i>

1054
01:39:54,684 --> 01:39:56,083
<i>Family.</i>

1055
01:40:35,458 --> 01:40:36,755
Prince Dastan!

1056
01:40:37,426 --> 01:40:38,450
Prince Dastan!

1057
01:40:39,362 --> 01:40:41,125
Bis? You're here!

1058
01:40:41,163 --> 01:40:42,596
Of course I'm here.

1059
01:40:43,699 --> 01:40:45,394
Our men have surrounded
Alamut's palace.

1060
01:40:45,868 --> 01:40:46,994
The battle is over.

1061
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:48,701
Not yet.

1062
01:40:57,246 --> 01:40:58,270
Wait!

1063
01:41:03,085 --> 01:41:04,416
Wait!

1064
01:41:08,724 --> 01:41:09,952
Wait.

1065
01:41:12,295 --> 01:41:13,956
Brave soldiers of Persia,

1066
01:41:14,330 --> 01:41:17,163
we have been deceived
into attacking this holy city!

1067
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:21,233
Alamut has no weapon forges!

1068
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:22,294
Dastan!

1069
01:41:23,272 --> 01:41:24,637
Have you gone mad?

1070
01:41:24,974 --> 01:41:29,308
I cannot stand silent in the face
of treachery. This war was set up

1071
01:41:29,345 --> 01:41:31,677
by one trusted above all else,

1072
01:41:31,981 --> 01:41:33,380
our Uncle Nizam!

1073
01:41:33,416 --> 01:41:35,350
Dastan has fought hard today,

1074
01:41:35,384 --> 01:41:36,681
perhaps too hard!

1075
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:39,654
What he needs now is to get out
from under this burning sun to rest,

1076
01:41:39,689 --> 01:41:40,986
gather his wits!

1077
01:41:42,191 --> 01:41:44,785
The weapons we found are forgeries!

1078
01:41:44,827 --> 01:41:47,022
There are no weapons here, Uncle,
and you know it!

1079
01:41:47,396 --> 01:41:51,355
And the spy who supposedly
intercepted them was hired by you

1080
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,369
to persuade all of us to invade Alamut!

1081
01:41:54,403 --> 01:41:57,270
What is this, Dastan?
Victor's remorse?

1082
01:41:57,306 --> 01:42:00,434
You yourself led the attack!
Brought us this great triumph!

1083
01:42:02,278 --> 01:42:04,644
I should never have
let the attack happen.

1084
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:09,643
I knew in my heart that it was wrong.

1085
01:42:12,421 --> 01:42:13,945
It will never be you.

1086
01:42:14,924 --> 01:42:16,391
You will never be king.

1087
01:42:17,093 --> 01:42:18,583
You don't have the heart.

1088
01:42:18,961 --> 01:42:22,658
You will die in the shadow
of a great man.

1089
01:42:28,004 --> 01:42:31,030
Get him down from there before he
makes an even bigger fool of himself!

1090
01:42:31,173 --> 01:42:35,371
Tus! Before you left Nasaf,
Father told you this,

1091
01:42:35,411 --> 01:42:37,402
that a true king
considers the advice of counsel,

1092
01:42:37,446 --> 01:42:40,313
but he always listens to his own heart.

1093
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:43,281
Father and I were alone.

1094
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:44,843
- How could you know that?
- He was right.

1095
01:42:45,221 --> 01:42:47,746
He knows us,
and he knows what we're capable of.

1096
01:42:47,923 --> 01:42:50,824
- Just listen to your heart.
- He defies your order

1097
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:52,855
in the attack
and now wants to turn back.

1098
01:42:52,895 --> 01:42:54,419
Tus.

1099
01:42:55,865 --> 01:42:57,162
Take measure here.

1100
01:43:10,613 --> 01:43:11,910
The spy knows the truth.

1101
01:43:12,415 --> 01:43:14,440
Find the spy! Bring him to me!

1102
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:16,841
We'll wring it from him!

1103
01:43:54,156 --> 01:43:56,351
You had what every man
could ever dream of.

1104
01:43:56,392 --> 01:43:59,361
Love, respect, and family.

1105
01:44:01,197 --> 01:44:03,893
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?

1106
01:44:40,336 --> 01:44:41,803
Princess of Alamut,

1107
01:44:43,706 --> 01:44:45,571
I was misled to attack your city.

1108
01:44:47,476 --> 01:44:51,435
Forgive me, Highness.
Let me try to make amends.

1109
01:45:00,456 --> 01:45:03,186
It would be to our mutual advantage

1110
01:45:03,225 --> 01:45:07,355
that our nations be united
by a bond stronger than friendship.

1111
01:45:08,030 --> 01:45:09,292
Marriage.

1112
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:15,837
Your marriage, to one who is both
conqueror and savior of your city.

1113
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:22,134
Dastan.

1114
01:45:23,512 --> 01:45:27,448
Royal blood or not,
he's every bit a son to our father.

1115
01:45:27,783 --> 01:45:29,808
Every bit a brother to Garsiv and me.

1116
01:45:30,553 --> 01:45:32,544
A true prince of Persia.

1117
01:45:37,693 --> 01:45:40,321
Get up there before I take your place.

1118
01:45:45,801 --> 01:45:47,428
Hello, Princess.

1119
01:45:49,605 --> 01:45:53,769
It is customary to accompany
a proposal with gifts,

1120
01:45:53,809 --> 01:45:57,336
but I was surprised,
and, alas, I'm unprepared.

1121
01:45:58,514 --> 01:46:00,448
I have nothing for you,

1122
01:46:01,350 --> 01:46:05,252
save that which was already yours.

1123
01:46:16,665 --> 01:46:19,793
Walk with me, Prince Dastan.

1124
01:46:28,143 --> 01:46:30,976
How can I trust the man
that breached the walls of my city?

1125
01:46:31,614 --> 01:46:35,141
I'm starting to think I'm no longer the
same man who breached those walls.

1126
01:46:35,184 --> 01:46:38,176
That's a short time for a man
to change so much.

1127
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:39,585
Perhaps.

1128
01:46:43,926 --> 01:46:47,054
It sounds as if
you've discovered something here.

1129
01:46:47,096 --> 01:46:48,859
What might that be?

1130
01:46:48,998 --> 01:46:51,023
A new spiritual awareness.

1131
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,825
- A destiny?
- Yes, exactly.

1132
01:46:54,536 --> 01:46:57,471
But I believe we make
our own destiny, Princess.

1133
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:00,568
You have an unfortunate
lack of curiosity.

1134
01:47:00,609 --> 01:47:02,543
No doubt one of my many flaws.

1135
01:47:02,578 --> 01:47:04,739
Please don't mock me, Prince.

1136
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:09,107
Oh, I hardly think we know each other
well enough for that, Princess.

1137
01:47:09,885 --> 01:47:11,318
But I look forward

1138
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:13,344
to the day that we do.
