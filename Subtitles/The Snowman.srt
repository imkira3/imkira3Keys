2
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,580
Mom, Mom!
Uncle Jonas is here!

3
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,671
No, it's not Tuesday today.

4
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,783
But he is. He's here.

5
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,437
So, after
the Germans surrendered,

6
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:38,635
when did our king return
to Norway from exile?

7
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,372
Um...

8
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,076
June 7th, 1945.

9
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,951
And on what date
did the Norwegian Parliament

10
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,256
hold its first election
after the war?

11
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,331
Um...

12
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,405
- July 6...
- Don't guess.

13
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,069
Uh...

14
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,667
August...

15
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,312
On what date

16
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:25,481
did the Norwegian Parliament hold
its first election since the war?

17
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,157
Uh.,.

18
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,089
August... August 12th, 1945.

19
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,266
You have to help him more.

20
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:29,047
I'm going to tell your wife
that he's your son.

21
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,419
And then she can tell
the rest of your family.

22
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,995
Then you'll never see me again.

23
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,534
Stop! Please!

24
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,104
Wait!

25
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,573
No!

26
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,414
Jonas!

27
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:04,853
No! Jonas! No!

28
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,413
Jonas!

29
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,891
Mom!

30
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,736
Mom?

31
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,764
Mom, come on,
we've gotta get outta here!

32
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,171
Mom, come on!

33
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,471
Open the door!

34
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,284
Mom, come on! Open the door!

35
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,544
Mom!

36
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,290
Mom!

37
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,191
No!

38
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,626
Don't leave me!

39
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,127
No!

40
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,084
Shit.

41
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,029
Morning.

42
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,676
Fuck it!

43
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,248
Piece of shit.

44
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,587
Harry Hole?

45
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,424
Hello.

46
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,561
Dry rot throughout
the whole building,

47
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,069
and I'm afraid
we've found some mold

48
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,197
behind the walls.

49
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,268
Aspergillus, toxic,

50
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,105
and pathogenic.

51
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,545
Yeah, your landlord let me in
to spray the apartment.

52
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,105
I'm gonna have to take
all these panels off,

53
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,879
and this is above your bed.
Jesus Christ.

54
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,553
Is there anywhere else
that you could stay?

55
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,920
The air in here is so bad, you're
actually killing your house plants.

56
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,828
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

57
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,667
You are familiar
with Emanuel Vigeland.

58
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,641
The brothers' work was most likely
influenced by their father,

59
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,339
who turned to drink, had an illegitimate
child with a younger woman.

60
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:54,158
You can clearly see
in each artist's case,

61
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:59,829
the recurring themes of love,
perverted and betrayed...

62
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,332
The good news is that with
this new version of the EviSync,

63
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,933
from version 3.6
to version 4.0,

64
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,847
allows you to
manually push the data

65
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,439
back to the server
using the cellular network.

66
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,878
The EviSync will automatically
upload all the new data

67
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:20,617
to the central police server
here, every 12 hours.

68
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,961
We've also done some work on the
fingerprint scanning software.

69
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,056
So, you will notice
a significantly faster

70
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,998
opening time after scanning
your fingerprint.

71
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,663
But please make sure
that your fingerprint scans

72
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:38,072
are done cleanly,
and clearly from the start.

73
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,906
If you are experiencing a
high number of false scans,

74
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,813
this is probably because your fingerprints
were scanned incorrectly from the start.

75
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,580
That must be nearly a whole
week of mail this time.

76
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,679
Did I miss anything
while I was away?

77
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,524
My uncle died.

78
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,025
Close, were you?

79
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,927
A leave of absence has to be
formally requested, in writing.

80
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,091
Doesn't matter who you are.

81
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,891
Backdate it,

82
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,232
but I can't keep
covering for you.

83
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,808
I'm dealing with it.

84
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,547
I need a case to work on.

85
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,210
I apologize for
Oslo's low murder rate.

86
00:12:54,874 --> 00:13:00,256
Let's, uh,
stick to the uncle story.

87
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,995
You scared my clients away.

88
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:52,941
I didn't forget Oleg's birthday.
I got him concert tickets.

89
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,109
What did you do?

90
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,282
We took him for a pizza.

91
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,883
Oleg misses you.

92
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,890
He doesn't get along
very well with Mathias.

93
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,722
What about you?

94
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:14,458
I'm not going to answer that.

95
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,864
He wants to meet
his real father.

96
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,036
I don't think
he's ready for that.

97
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,652
Thank you for
walking me back home.

98
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,191
See you at the game.

99
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,751
Tell Oleg I'm sorry I missed it.

100
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,887
Hi!

101
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,390
The snowman.

102
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,557
What?

103
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,595
Snowman!

104
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,704
I'll take a picture.

105
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,003
Beautiful, honey.

106
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,912
Mum!

107
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,624
Hi.
Hi.

108
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,251
Hello.

109
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,590
Can I borrow your scarf?

110
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:41,291
You want my scarf? Here.

111
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,300
I told you
I had to leave by 8:00.

112
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,064
And I told you that I had
to help one of my students.

113
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,010
No, thanks.

114
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,419
It's the smoking room.

115
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,927
Yeah, but it's the only place
I can concentrate, so...

116
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,429
I'm, um...
I'm Katrine Bratt.

117
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,199
Harry Hole.

118
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,761
I know who you are. We, um... We actually
studied your cases at the academy.

119
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,032
I didn't know
they date back that far.

120
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,440
Yeah' you're up there
with the legends, so...

121
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,550
I don't know who you are.

122
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,415
No, I'm new. I, um...
I transferred from Bergen.

123
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,053
Actually, they've put me
in your office.

124
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,560
Okay. Bye.

125
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,594
Mom?

126
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,271
Mommy?

127
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,850
Mommy.

128
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,911
Okay, where can I drop you?
I'm on a call.

129
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,045
It's okay.
I'm in no hurry.

130
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,089
So, why don't you have a car?

131
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,419
I don't have a license.

132
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,590
Missing persons?

133
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,731
Yeah, it's a woman.
The call just came in.

134
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:23,279
So, this machine is called
“EviSync and I will record you,

135
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,246
so, there's a little camera on the
other side. You're aware of it.

136
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,407
Right.

137
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,247
Would you like to walk me
through what happened?

138
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,254
Well, I saw Josephine in
the garden in her pajamas.

139
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:36,850
And I thought, "What is she
doing out in this cold?"

140
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,692
So, I came over to check.

141
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,294
And she said she couldn't
find her mother.

142
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:47,303
I tried calling the father, but
apparently, he's away on business.

143
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,019
How long has she been missing?

144
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,652
Two days.

145
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,266
She said she was going to visit a
friend, and she never came back.

146
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:56,163
Why did you come to me?
I've been suspended.

147
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,673
Because you're a friend.

148
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:02,268
And you're a great detective.

149
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,837
But I don't want anyone
knowing about this just yet.

150
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:08,180
Not yet. I don't
wanna go to the police.

151
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:13,018
Can you tell me, was
your wife seeing anyone?

152
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,293
I, uh, checked
her credit card bills.

153
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,029
She's been to see
a pregnancy doctor.

154
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:25,796
Well, that... That's
great news, Frederik.

155
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,834
We haven't shared a bed
in three years.

156
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,752
This is Birte Becker.
Please leave a message.

157
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,698
This is Bide Becker.
Please leave a message.

158
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,793
This is Birte Becker.

159
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,588
Hello, Mr. Donkey.

160
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,656
Can I sit down?

161
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,302
It's a nice place you've got here, Mr.
Donkey.

162
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,610
Did you do this by yourself?

163
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,413
My mom helped me.

164
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,286
Was she in a good mood
when she got home?

165
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,812
Mmm.

166
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,425
And what about your dad'?

167
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,466
He was grumpy again
'cause Mommy was late.

168
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,528
Did she call to say
she'd be late?

169
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,944
My dad doesn't want me
to have a phone.

170
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,877
She didn't phone the house?

171
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,182
Is he grumpy often?

172
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,288
Has your mother
been upset lately,

173
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:10,489
when your father's been grumpy?

174
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,567
Have you ever seen her cry?

175
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,674
No. But I saw Daddy cry.

176
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,138
When?

177
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,472
A few nights ago.
He saw me, too.

178
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,413
What did he do?

179
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:33,353
Locked himself in the bathroom.

180
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,387
Where was Mommy
when he was crying?

181
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,319
She'd gone out.

182
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,522
Oh...

183
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:43,655
Shit.

184
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,402
Yeah, is this Filip Becker?
Yeah, I'm gonna have to call you back.

185
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,837
I better go. Thank you.

186
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,007
He cried last week.

187
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,882
Why did you build the snowman
facing the house?

188
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,745
I didn't build the snowman.

189
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,920
This is Birte Becker.
Please leave a message.

190
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,928
This is Bide Becker.
Please leave a message.

191
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,988
Do you want a coffee,
or something?

192
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,156
No.

193
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,234
Look, you're not gonna try
and sleep with me, are you?

194
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,397
No.

195
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,097
Okay, good.

196
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,806
She'll show up.
She's having an affair.

197
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,471
She left her coat and her
handbag in the house,

198
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,344
and the front door was open.

199
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,944
Even if you're having an affair,

200
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,919
you do not leave
your child like that.

201
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,978
And, Harry,
she's not the only one.

202
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,524
Look, this is Hege Dahl.
Missing two weeks.

203
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:19,790
Similar age, young children.
Unhappy marriage.

204
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,165
Talk to the husband.

205
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,898
411 to dispatch-
Dispatch, do you receive?

206
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,202
Go ahead, 411.

207
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,244
Up in Mount Ulriken.

208
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,835
It looks like a homicide.

209
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,678
Adult female. It's hard to see from
here, but there's a Jot of blood.

210
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,049
A group of
school children found her.

211
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,869
I've got a problem.
Rafto just showed up.

212
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,698
What the hell's he doing there?

213
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,761
He's been suspended.

214
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,866
Try telling him that.

215
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,707
We'll' send the
kids down with their teacher.

216
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,679
Make sure there's a care
officer to meet them,

217
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,012
and someone to deal
with the parents.

218
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,259
One of the children,
they heard a noise'

219
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,799
and they went to see
what it was.

220
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:05,095
Listen, listen.
John, John.

221
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,431
I'm gonna need you
to calm down. Calm down.

222
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,938
It's important that you answer my
questions and give me the information.

223
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,939
- Who's in charge?
- Svenson.

224
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,373
OFFICER 2; Jesus.

225
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:17,876
I! Gets worse.
Rafto just arrived.

226
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,110
Perfect,
the drunk and the halfwit.

227
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:23,413
Just keep them apart, will you?

228
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,489
I'll see what I can do.

229
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,393
Where are you going?

230
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,660
Rafto!

231
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,807
Rafto!

232
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,609
We're closed.
It's all right.

233
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,962
You have something of mine.

234
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,622
It's not yours.

235
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,464
Cold case.

236
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,302
I have clearance to take it
out, you don't.

237
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,798
So, what'?
You're gonna report me?

238
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,482
Eli Kvale. Tell me.

239
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:08,151
She was married.
She left three children.

240
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,225
The 12th of November, six
years ago, she went missing.

241
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,924
And the day she vanished,
it was snowing.

242
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:21,905
Hege Dahl disappeared
the 8th of November.

243
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,099
The day she went missing,
it was snowing.

244
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,766
Not unusual, it's winter.

245
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,367
Now, Birte Becker.

246
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,074
The night she disappeared...

247
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:33,346
Snowing.
Yeah.

248
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,379
I think it's the falling snow
that sets the killer off.

249
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,251
And furthermore,
they're all married,

250
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:40,516
they all have children.

251
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:46,758
Did you talk to Filip Becker?

252
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,922
Nine times out of 10,
the husband did it.

253
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,059
He was interviewed and his alibi is solid.
He was 100 miles away.

254
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,239
Have you eaten?

255
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,070
No.

256
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,700
No, I haven't. I'm hungry.

257
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,454
"Twenty-eighth,
handball."

258
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,387
Josephine's handball match.

259
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:21,322
"Third, F. Lunch."

260
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:25,629
That's lunch
with her friend, Frida.

261
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,795
I really... I don't see
the point in doing this.

262
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,565
I won't keep you much longer.

263
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,070
"Ninth, Vetlesen."
He's her doctor.

264
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,134
Tenth...

265
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,737
Do you have any idea why
your wife went to see him?

266
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,242
Who?

267
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,843
Dr. Vetlesen.

268
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,250
No.

269
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,482
"Tenth, yoga."

270
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,320
ls there any reason
you can think of

271
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,157
why your wife might
disappear so suddenly'?

272
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,966
Your marriage,

273
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:01,334
was everything all right?

274
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,170
Were either of you
having an affair?

275
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,711
Daddy!

276
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,875
Come on!

277
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,314
I promised her we'd
walk around the neighborhood

278
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,511
to see if we could find
her mother.

279
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,315
I'm just gonna get
my jacket, darling!

280
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,947
Come out! Dad!

281
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,430
Step inside.

282
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,747
Mmm. I thought
you wouldn't remember.

283
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,522
Is he still
giving you a hard time?

284
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,857
If you want, I can talk to him.

285
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,354
Oh!
Oh!

286
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:41,967
Just have fun tonight.
He misses you.

287
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,471
Hi, Harry.

288
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,972
Good to see you.

289
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,772
Sorry I'm late, honey.

290
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,945
Have you had anything to eat?

291
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,209
No, I'll grab something later.

292
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,252
No' no, no,
but I've got vouchers.

293
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,479
Yeah?
Yep.

294
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,578
Hot dog, or hot dog.

295
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,489
Well, hot dog, then.

296
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,958
Harry?

297
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,928
I'll get something to eat
with Oleg after.

298
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,973
So, how are things with you?

299
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,567
All right.
Yeah?

300
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:25,141
A bit tired.

301
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,409
You've been working
too hard, haven't you?

302
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,820
I can't sleep.

303
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:38,361
You should try Valzetai.
It's a new one.

304
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,860
It'll help you sleep.

305
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,326
I can give you
a prescription right now.

306
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,526
Really?
Yeah.

307
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,034
With that?

308
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,536
Yeah.

309
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:04,014
She won't allow me to
try and find my father.

310
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,645
Your mother should be
the judge of that.

311
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,851
She won't listen to me.

312
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,896
She's worried about you.

313
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,299
All she cares about is herself.

314
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,232
All she cares about is you.

315
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:24,137
That's why she dumped me.
I'm such a bad influence.

316
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,505
She's concerned.

317
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,306
Concerned about what?

318
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,712
The fact that you
run away from home.

319
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:35,842
The fact that
you've been drinking.

320
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:40,049
So, you're gonna give me a
lecture about drinking?

321
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,558
Don't be a prick.

322
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,860
Your mum told me
the school's arranged

323
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,864
a father-and-son
camping trip.

324
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:52,193
If you want, I can come.

325
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,031
But you're not
her boyfriend anymore.

326
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,062
So?

327
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:05,610
Yeah. Yeah,
I want you to come.

328
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,545
You sure?

329
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,712
Yeah.

330
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,388
Good.

331
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:18,517
So, what's the big surprise?
Uh...

332
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:24,562
Let's find out. Someone at
work got me the tickets.

333
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,480
You've got a message.

334
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,480
Let me see what it says!

335
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:46,214
I gotta make a call!
You staying here?

336
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,655
Harry, there's another
missing woman. In Geilo this time.

337
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,955
That's not our jurisdiction.

338
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,587
I think we should have
a look at this.

339
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,756
I'm gonna be with you
in two minutes, okay?

340
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,428
Her husband
specifically asked for you.

341
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,469
- Hello.
- Hi.

342
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,604
Oh, didn't expect you so early.

343
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,774
Something came up.
Oh.

344
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,283
Hi, Harry.

345
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,683
- Hi.
- How was the concert?

346
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:21,349
Yeah, it was great.

347
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,356
We spoke.

348
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,796
I'm taking him on the
father-and-son camping trip

349
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,332
thing.

350
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:36,697
See you.

351
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:37,932
Hey.

352
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,998
Bye.

353
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,677
Take me home. We'll go in the morning.

354
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,548
Who reported her missing?

355
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:34,695
Her husband,
last night, 20:05.

356
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,824
Sylvia Ottersen, 33 years old.

357
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:42,195
Self-employed.
Married twice.

358
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,603
But no children.

359
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:02,520
Hello?

360
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,019
Hello?

361
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,226
Hello?

362
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,294
Hi.
Hi.

363
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:46,390
Can I help you?

364
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,338
Yeah, well, we're with
the Oslo Police.

365
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,241
We got the missing persons call.

366
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,574
Oh. Who's missing?

367
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,673
Sylvia Ottersen.

368
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,742
I'm Sylvia Ottersen.

369
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,516
What, you're
Sylvia Ottersen? Why...

370
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:08,318
Why would your husband
report you missing?

371
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:11,086
No idea. He's not the kind
to play practical jokes.

372
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:14,424
Is he here?
No.

373
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,129
He's gone to the station
to pick up my sister.

374
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:21,500
Okay. Well, I guess
it must be a prank call.

375
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:22,798
We didn't know where you were,

376
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,500
so, we had a look inside
the house.

377
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,200
I turned your music off.

378
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:30,472
Sorry about that.

379
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:32,105
Thank you.

380
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,716
Can I just ask you, is it
just you and your husband,

381
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,016
or do you have any children?

382
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,453
No, it's just us.

383
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,194
Okay, thank you.

384
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:05,475
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

385
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,973
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

386
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:13,215
Calling the police,
telling them I'm missing.

387
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,018
You think that's funny?

388
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,559
Don't you understand?
It's over.

389
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:18,991
I don't want to see you again.

390
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:24,523
No, it wasn't your child.
It was mine.

391
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:27,866
If you call one more time,
I'm going to the police.

392
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:44,102
HQ to DC Brett.

393
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:45,613
DC Brett.

394
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,081
Yeah, speaking.

395
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,845
We've had
a missing persons report,

396
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:51,146
a woman named Sylvia Ottersen.

397
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:54,485
No, she's fine.
We just left her.

398
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:58,082
Well, the call came in
two minutes ago.

399
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:01,153
Her husband asked specifically
for Inspector Hole.

400
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,858
How could...

401
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,433
Turn the car around.

402
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,814
Sylvia?

403
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:28,684
Sorry we're back,
Mrs. Ottersen.

404
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:31,157
We just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

405
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,627
I'm Ane Pedersen.

406
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:38,497
Sylvia is my sister. We're twins.
Who are you?

407
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:16,898
Is that enough?

408
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,297
Yeah, keep going.

409
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:19,959
Did you find Hagen?

410
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,593
He's at the dinner at City Hall.

411
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:26,565
Keep it clear if you can.

412
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,249
She was a free spirit.

413
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,018
And she always liked men,

414
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,160
ever since we were teenagers.

415
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,967
She was a good person.

416
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,805
She didn't want to hurt anyone.

417
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:02,470
It's just the way she was.

418
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:11,178
I know your sister
didn't have any children.

419
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:13,016
It was just that
there was something

420
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,453
in her reaction,
that when I asked.“

421
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,617
She was pregnant.

422
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:23,189
She wasn't sure
who the father was.

423
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,967
She got rid of the baby
a few weeks ago.

424
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,513
Ladies and gentlemen,

425
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,556
introducing our guest of honor,

426
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,921
king of industry,
philanthropist,

427
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:27,189
and head of Oslo's Winter
Games bid, Arve Stop!

428
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,697
So lovely of you
to be here for us.

429
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,358
I'm not on the list,
but I know many of these people.

430
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:33,458
I'm supposed to be on the list.

431
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:36,936
I'm a close old friend
of Arve Stop's, you see.

432
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,870
There's been some kind
of misunderstanding.

433
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,431
I have a person named Vetlesen.

434
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:41,532
Come on up.
You can come here.

435
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,103
He says
he's a friend of Arve Stop.

436
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,943
No. Wait, wait. No,
it's fine, it's fine.

437
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,539
No, just relax, just relax.

438
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,419
I run over a dozen companies.

439
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,956
When people ask me

440
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,458
why I've given up so much of
my time to lead this bio',

441
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:02,656
I tell them it's because s'
never had these opportunities.

442
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:04,494
When I was a boy,

443
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:07,262
the only winter sports
I engaged in were

444
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:10,931
the uphill snow shove! And the
50-meter firewood carry.

445
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:19,070
Thar is why I believe
passionately that this Cup

446
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:24,313
is about much more than just
publicity for our fair city.

447
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,458
Homicides?

448
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,020
Just missing persons for now,

449
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,690
but the pattern is disturbing.

450
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,296
And I received this.

451
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,709
Prints?

452
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,472
It isn't just the letter.

453
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:53,014
He reported her missing
before he killed her.

454
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,105
He was watching us
the entire time.

455
00:52:58,509 --> 00:52:59,544
What do you need?

456
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,281
A small team.

457
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,188
I'll set up a separate
incident room at the mill.

458
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,453
All right, but I don't want
a word of this to be leaked...

459
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:06,517
To the press.

460
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:10,656
Press. Yeah, not until
this fucking bid is over.

461
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,563
You look very pretty tonight.
You know that.

462
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:45,065
And now you're trying t0... You
see, now you try to smile.

463
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:46,930
Smile, smile.
That's great.

464
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,436
Does this strike you as the
proper time and place for this?

465
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:57,105
Wait.

466
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:21,694
Idiot.

467
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:25,598
What? Arve?

468
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:27,471
What? No, don't cry.

469
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:28,871
It's...

470
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:31,402
Why...

471
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,581
Shit.

472
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,765
Hey.

473
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:02,003
Hey!

474
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,646
Get out.

475
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:12,311
Get out!

476
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:30,030
Hey!

477
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:33,672
Oi, mate!

478
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:40,177
Annette Elden, 33,
disappeared 12th of December, 2006.

479
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,682
Her head washed ashore
near Arendal,

480
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:45,151
rest of the body never found.

481
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:49,316
Forensic reports indicate
saw marks on her neck.

482
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,859
Status, unmarried,

483
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:54,793
two children
by different fathers.

484
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:56,861
Harry, I've got the names
and the addresses

485
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:58,729
of Sylvia Ottersen's boyfriends.

486
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:01,200
Now, she went to the clinic
the second of November,

487
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:04,135
but they won't break
patient confidentiality.

488
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:08,834
They do, however,
perform abortions.

489
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,813
What is it?

490
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,751
- Magnus, get me the list.
- What list?

491
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,549
The list of doctors
at the Gellion.

492
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:24,421
I'm thinking that he's going after
women that he disapproves of.

493
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:28,690
Here. All the doctors at Gellion
from the last five years.

494
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:33,832
How did he know? How did he know
Sylvia Ottersen was pregnant?

495
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:41,840
"Idar Vetlesen."

496
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:47,379
Birte Becker had an appointment
with the same doctor.

497
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,971
Dr. Idar Vetlesen?

498
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:14,303
Yes, that's me.

499
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:15,399
Step in.

500
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:18,605
Birte Becker and Sylvia Ottersen
were both patients of yours?

501
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:22,240
No, they were both
patients at the clinic.

502
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:23,944
I never met Sylvia Ottersen.

503
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,952
Can you tell me who treated her?

504
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:29,217
No, I'm bound by
patient confidentiality.

505
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:31,319
She's dead.

506
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:32,922
Oh...

507
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:34,655
Oh, no.

508
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,600
Right. Well,
doctor confidentiality.

509
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:41,431
In theory, would it be possible for
you to access her medical files?

510
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:42,663
Even if you didn't
treat her yourself.

511
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:45,068
Well, in theory, yes.

512
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:48,302
The doctors at the clinic have
access to the files of every patient

513
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:52,005
should they choose to look
at them, which I did not.

514
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,343
What did you see
Birte Becker about?

515
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:56,918
Well, that is confidential.

516
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,851
How do you know Awe Stop?

517
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:01,613
Awe?

518
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:05,657
Well, I've known Arve for years.

519
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:07,820
I do research
in premature birth.

520
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:11,661
We have a small charity, and Arve Stop
is one of our biggest supporters.

521
00:58:11,755 --> 00:58:13,029
Huh. Wouldn't have
thought that a man

522
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:14,659
who goes on so much
about family values

523
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:17,261
would support a clinic that
specializes in abortion.

524
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:21,341
Well, we specialize
in many different areas.

525
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:25,345
And Mr. Stop supports our
research in premature birth.

526
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,278
So, do you see
each other socially?

527
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:30,975
Yeah, well, that
depends on how you mean...

528
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,850
It is quite simple, actually.
Do you have friends in common?

529
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:35,719
Yes, we mix
in the same circles, so...

530
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:37,223
Why are you...

531
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:39,726
Have you ever practiced in other
parts of the country, Dr. Vetlesen?

532
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,352
Yes.

533
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,624
I have' in Eidsvoll,
in Lillehammer...

534
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,668
I see you have a picture of Mon
Plaisir pavilion in Bergen.

535
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:47,963
Yes. Yes, in Bergen.

536
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:50,897
Do you live alone?

537
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:55,970
Yes, I, uh...
lam a reluctant bachelor.

538
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:59,708
Is there anyone in
the house right now?

539
00:58:59,803 --> 00:59:02,647
Because I thought I saw someone
in the window when I passed.

540
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:06,344
Well, if you want to
take a look around,

541
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,481
I will need to see
a search warrant.

542
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,424
In fact, if you don't mind,

543
00:59:11,515 --> 00:59:13,722
I would like to call my lawyer

544
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:15,888
before I answer any more
of your questions.

545
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:19,433
That won't be necessary,
Dr. Vetlesen.

546
00:59:19,523 --> 00:59:22,868
You can bring your lawyer
when we see you next time.

547
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,937
Hey. Hey.

548
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,103
What was that?

549
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:33,273
What?

550
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:37,079
He isn't a suspect yet. We need his
permission to search the house.

551
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:38,710
I know that.

552
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:41,449
Why'd you ask him
about Arve Stop?

553
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:45,688
I saw a picture of
them both together.

554
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:47,728
And?

555
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,286
And it was an innocent question.

556
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:51,866
Jesus. Anyone can see he's
trying to hide something.

557
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:59,237
Like a Netflix
type thing. Oh, hey.

558
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,987
Cloudberry.

559
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,222
If you hadn't told me
to look out for it,

560
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,818
I'd have assumed she was
attached to his security detail.

561
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:22,453
Cloudberry?

562
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,054
It's her password.

563
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:28,631
Does this
strike you as the proper time

564
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,170
and place for this?

565
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:36,637
Awe Stop.

566
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:37,677
Idiot.

567
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,804
She filmed him

568
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:43,908
at rallies,
at restaurants, at home.

569
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,768
Hi. Do you want a ride?

570
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:10,968
No.

571
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:22,282
Bye.

572
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:23,884
The 8:45 train to
Bergen is leaving from platform five.

573
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,381
Oh, sorry.

574
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,090
This is the
8:45 service to Bergen,

575
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:36,289
stopping at Gol,
Finse, Voss, and Bergen.

576
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:39,367
The next station is Gol.

577
01:02:58,208 --> 01:02:59,551
Hi, Harry.

578
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:03,213
Hi.

579
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,226
Hiding in the playroom, are we?

580
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,556
Yes.

581
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:12,055
Don't worry. I'm getting
off at the next stop.

582
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:15,103
Going far?
Bergen.

583
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:16,660
Ah. Rather you than me.

584
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,266
Then again,

585
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:20,137
I am attending
a three-day conference

586
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:23,177
on bio-identical
hormone restoration.

587
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,439
I thought you were
a plastic surgeon.

588
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:30,474
Well, you know, cosmetic surgery
needs to move with the times, too.

589
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:35,249
We're swapping the scalpel for
hormone replacement therapy.

590
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,155
If you can slow down
the aging process,

591
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:40,956
there won't be any need for
face lifts, will there?

592
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:43,429
I'll bear that in mind.

593
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,127
So, how's the prescription
working?

594
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,502
Sleeping like a baby.
Splendid.

595
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:56,775
So, you canceled the Oleg thing.

596
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:03,649
The school trip, weren't
you supposed to...

597
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:05,118
Oh, shit.

598
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:09,013
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, Harry.

599
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:14,361
Ah... I'm sure he's fine.
He knows how busy you are.

600
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:15,691
Shit!

601
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,126
Look. Look, you're not
his father, Harry.

602
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:22,801
What does that mean?

603
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,464
Well, uh...

604
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,564
I don't have to be his father
to care about him.

605
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:28,199
I was just trying to say that

606
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:32,371
it's a big enough responsibility
for a real father, isn't it?

607
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:33,812
Let alone you and me.

608
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:39,577
I'm sorry, Harry.
No.

609
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:47,055
Did you hear from him?

610
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,723
- Why can't I go? Can I go with you?
- Just go.

611
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:57,028
Hi, Oleg.
It's Mathias.

612
01:04:57,093 --> 01:05:00,233
You know what? I forgot to
check my messages last night,

613
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:04,904
and Harry called to say that
he couldn't make your trip.

614
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,345
No, I know.

615
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,543
No, well, he couldn't
get through to you,

616
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:11,381
or your mom apparently, so...

617
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,848
No, it's totally my fault, Oleg.

618
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,516
Yes, yes.
I'm sorry.

619
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:20,024
I'm sorry, Oleg. Yes.

620
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:23,088
Yeah.

621
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:25,530
So, see you in a few days, then,

622
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,864
when I'm back from
the conference. Yeah.

623
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:34,868
You didn't have to do that.

624
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,584
Hey, Aasen. Somebody
here to speak to you.

625
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,457
Aasen.

626
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,829
My family owned
all of these buildings,

627
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:39,998
and that house over there, too.

628
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:42,838
Arve Stop worked for us
back then.

629
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:47,176
He was bright, ambitious.

630
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,807
My father really
believed in him.

631
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:55,681
The business wasn't going very well,
so, we, uh, offered him a stake.

632
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:59,021
Within a year,
he had forced us out.

633
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,220
Sold the land for a fortune.

634
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:07,293
Have any of my colleagues been
in touch with you recently?

635
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,031
A Young lady?

636
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:14,000
I look at this picture now.

637
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,168
I see Laila staring at him.

638
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,475
No idea at the time.

639
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:23,207
Family man, eh?

640
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:30,156
Do you remember the name
of your wife's doctor?

641
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:32,750
Sure. Morton Freiberg.

642
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,891
Did she ever see someone
called "Vetlesen"?

643
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,368
Vetlesen? No.

644
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:44,996
Dr. Idar Vetlesen.

645
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:50,276
No.

646
01:07:52,035 --> 01:07:54,072
Any idea where I might
find the officer

647
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,945
who's in charge of the case?

648
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:57,211
Rafto?

649
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,415
He died.

650
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:05,687
Yeah, he died
around the same time.

651
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,104
Detective Rafto.

652
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:56,473
Can you connect me
to Haukeland Hospital?

653
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:57,567
Rafto.

654
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,136
What is this'?
Am I under arrest?

655
01:09:00,103 --> 01:09:01,173
A cake!

656
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,650
Yeah, I need some information
on a patient, Laila Aasen.

657
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:06,914
No, I don't...

658
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,752
Listen to me. I don't know
the admitting doctor.

659
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,816
But perhaps she was there
for an abortion.

660
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:14,326
Happy birthday to you.

661
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:15,521
Well, then, I'll come down there

662
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,656
with a fucking warrant myself.

663
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:21,964
Happy birthday, dear Svenson.

664
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:25,365
Happy birthday to you.

665
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:26,838
- Rafto.
- RAFTO; Idiot.

666
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,875
Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!

667
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:32,139
Fucking incompetent
sons of bitches.

668
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,274
Rafto!

669
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:37,040
Rafto!

670
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,455
In, in! Get back!

671
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:48,225
Get back in!
Get back in!

672
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:50,228
Happy birthday to you.

673
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:53,199
You idiot!

674
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:59,364
I heard he was
a great detective.

675
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:01,669
He was a suicidal maniac.

676
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:03,540
They were gonna
suspend him, anyway.

677
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:05,306
They found stuff in his drawers.

678
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:08,406
Items he'd stolen from
various crime scenes.

679
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:10,643
Is this him?

680
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:15,648
Where'd you get this'?

681
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:17,814
From a colleague.

682
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,823
Yes, that's him.

683
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:25,399
He had this cabin
up on the coast.

684
01:10:25,488 --> 01:10:27,729
Used to go up there
to get smashed.

685
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:29,667
He was probably drunk
when he shot himself.

686
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,838
What's this on the floor?

687
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:39,005
They look like coffee beans.

688
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,070
Maybe he was trying
to sober up after all.

689
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,178
You didn't check?

690
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,917
The cabin was locked
from the inside,

691
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,684
and he looked like that
when they found him.

692
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,192
There wasn't anything to check.

693
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:57,888
Did he have any family?

694
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:01,395
Wife, who left him a year
before he killed himself.

695
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,698
I think there was a daughter.

696
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:06,738
Do you know where she is now?

697
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,969
Not a clue.

698
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,268
Is the cabin still there?

699
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,146
What are you doing with
my fucking gun, you idiot?

700
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,449
Here's the papers you asked for.

701
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:08,329
Where's Harry?

702
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:11,869
In Bergen.

703
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:30,010
- Hello?
- Mr. Hole?

704
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,551
This is Harry Hole's phone.

705
01:13:31,941 --> 01:13:33,852
Can I speak to him?

706
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:36,880
He's not here right now, but I
can take the message for him.

707
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:38,016
Right, okay.

708
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,253
Uh, this is Rebecca,
NRS at Telenor.

709
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:43,296
We picked up a signal from
a missing person's phone.

710
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:45,229
Case number MP two.

711
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:48,428
Um... I don't have any files in
front of me. Um, who's that?

712
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:51,198
I'll check.
Birte Becker.

713
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:56,032
What, is it transmitting now?

714
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,907
Yeah, just got it
in minutes ago.

715
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:59,969
Yeah, but wait.
Is it moving right now?

716
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:01,070
No.

717
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:02,309
I'll send you the coordinates.

718
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:03,713
No, just...
What's the address?

719
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:08,746
Uh, Parkway 1, 0139, Oslo.

720
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:10,982
You're sure that's correct?

721
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,650
Yes, Parkway 1.

722
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,222
Hey, are you all right?

723
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:56,756
This is Birte Becker.
Please leave a message.

724
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:23,008
Yes?

725
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:29,355
In his own garage?
Yeah.

726
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:55,938
Ah. The great Harry Hole.

727
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:58,047
How many bodies?

728
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,881
Birte Becker
and Ms. Dahl.

729
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:02,319
Where's Katrine?
Suspended.

730
01:18:02,378 --> 01:18:04,858
She got a call telling her
they traced the Becker phone,

731
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:06,790
and didn't think to tell anyone.

732
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,726
I asked you where she was.

733
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,457
That's not my problem right now.

734
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:14,827
He shot himself straight on.

735
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,892
How do you do that
with a shotgun?

736
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:20,132
It's too long,
you'd have to angle it.

737
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,699
The pellet marks should
be up there somewhere.

738
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:27,008
Luckily, we have experts
to determine that.

739
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:29,880
You sure he was alone?

740
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:31,212
The garage door was closed.

741
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:32,547
One set of footprints.

742
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:36,748
We found two bodies in the
house, and Birte Becker's phone.

743
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:40,553
It was a suicide.

744
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:42,026
Case closed.

745
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:51,732
Mathias, listen, I have
no idea where he's gone.

746
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:56,240
Yes, I've checked my messages,
he hasn't called.

747
01:18:56,332 --> 01:19:00,007
Oh, well, how can you help?
You're at your bloody conference!

748
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,216
Can I keep this?

749
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:05,708
No.

750
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:09,681
Can I keep this?

751
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:14,123
Yeah, sure.

752
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:21,428
She's not picking up.

753
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:31,643
Katrine!

754
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:53,222
Get off!

755
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:57,997
Stop!

756
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:08,077
I guess congratulations
are in order.

757
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,150
You know it wasn't that creep.

758
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:14,949
Vetlesen didn't commit suicide.

759
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,923
Someone killed him
because we got too close.

760
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:28,833
Like your father.

761
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:31,598
My father would never
have committed suicide.

762
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,140
He would never have
left me like that.

763
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:36,836
Get off me.
Get off me. Get off me!

764
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:38,343
Get off me!

765
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:41,313
Get off me, you fucking drunk!

766
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:43,281
Get off!

767
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,112
Get off.

768
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:46,278
Yeah.

769
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,823
I'm a drunk.

770
01:20:54,116 --> 01:20:56,289
Like your father.

771
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:14,708
Laila Aasen and Awe Stop
were having an affair,

772
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:17,044
and that's the last thing
my father was investigating

773
01:21:17,139 --> 01:21:18,345
before he got killed.

774
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,855
You broke into Vetlesen's house

775
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:25,482
because you were afraid I'd
find out this was personal

776
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:26,719
and take you off the case.

777
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:28,522
Vetlesen was his pimp!

778
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:30,723
And they were both in Bergen
when the murders started.

779
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:32,230
I know how much you want this,

780
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:34,392
but you can't force
the pieces to fit.

781
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:37,869
I called the Gellion Clinic, and
Vetlesen wasn't even working

782
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:40,372
the day he was supposed to
meet Birte Becker.

783
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:42,942
They found two dead
bodies in his house,

784
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,169
and Birte Becker's phone.

785
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,576
Yeah, well,
isn't that convenient, then?

786
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:50,741
So, Hagen has his killer and Arve St0p's
safe, and no questions are asked.

787
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:53,080
Do you actually think
he killed them?

788
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:54,347
I don't know.

789
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:58,184
I don't think
either of us do for sure.

790
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:05,794
Maybe this will bring
your balls back.

791
01:22:26,575 --> 01:22:28,452
I'm gonna need your weapon.

792
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:30,387
It's right there
in front of you.

793
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:49,675
Why did he call you Cloudberry?

794
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:57,640
Because I liked Cloudberry jam
with ice cream.

795
01:24:33,035 --> 01:24:34,742
Oleg ran away again.

796
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:56,029
It doesn't really matter if
we win or lose this bid tonight.

797
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,593
What matters most is that

798
01:24:57,693 --> 01:25:00,606
we celebrate the way
this has brought us together,

799
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:05,111
and use that energy to restore the
values that make Norway great.

800
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:09,580
And so, it doesn't matter if, uh,
56 minutes and 33 seconds from now,

801
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:11,049
but who's counting?

802
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:17,781
If the World Cup goes to
Beijing or Denver or Montreal.

803
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:21,622
Because I believe
in my heart, tonight,

804
01:25:21,717 --> 01:25:23,560
Oslo has already won.

805
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:26,826
Cheers!

806
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:32,232
I tried calling. I thought
he might be with you.

807
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,434
Uh...
He's okay.

808
01:25:35,564 --> 01:25:37,510
He's at a friend's house.

809
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:40,478
Just didn't bother calling me.

810
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:42,514
What did you argue about?

811
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:46,752
He doesn't want
to leave the city.

812
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:51,818
I thought that change
would be good for him.

813
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,919
Well, for me, too.

814
01:25:57,185 --> 01:25:58,755
Where?

815
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:03,360
Um, Mathias has a house,
uh, up in Telemark.

816
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:06,132
And because he consults
all over the place,

817
01:26:06,762 --> 01:26:09,675
it's not too inconvenient

818
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:13,338
I saw him the other day,
he didn't mention anything.

819
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:18,348
Is that really what you want?

820
01:26:20,042 --> 01:26:23,046
I don't know what I want.

821
01:26:28,717 --> 01:26:30,788
I miss you.

822
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:39,634
Weir', in my head, I know
it's 50-50, but in my heart, 100%.

823
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,697
Thank you for coming.
Mr. Stop?

824
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:43,674
Mr. Stop, I'm sorry.
I, um...

825
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:48,804
I just want to thank you.
I really liked your speech.

826
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,646
I found it very, very moving.

827
01:26:52,841 --> 01:26:53,911
You see, I, um...

828
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:59,390
I was an orphan, myself, so...

829
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:00,482
Well,

830
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:03,723
it doesn't have to be
a disadvantage, young lady.

831
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:05,162
It can motivate us, too.

832
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:07,526
Oh.

833
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:10,502
On, yes.

834
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:16,434
I work in Bergen with young
people in a care center,

835
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:18,340
and I know how
very busy you are,

836
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,572
but if you're ever
in the city...

837
01:27:19,668 --> 01:27:23,172
I started my career in Bergen.

838
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,411
Write to me.
I'll see what I can do.

839
01:27:25,507 --> 01:27:26,747
Yes. I'm so sorry.
I know...

840
01:27:26,842 --> 01:27:28,685
I know people are waiting to talk to you.
Thank you.

841
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:30,223
Not at all.
Oh.

842
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:37,018
Yes.

843
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:44,764
Mr. Stop wanted me
to let you know.

844
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:47,066
Oh. How much he enjoyed
your conversation.

845
01:27:47,129 --> 01:27:49,735
It's, um, room 472.

846
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:53,040
He'll be free
after the announcement,

847
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:55,707
if there's anything else
you'd like to ask him.

848
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:57,478
Thank you.

849
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:55,733
RAKEL; Mathias.

850
01:29:55,824 --> 01:29:57,735
Where are you?

851
01:29:57,826 --> 01:29:59,533
I just tried calling you on the landline-

852
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:02,599
I'm at Harry's.

853
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:04,733
Yeah?

854
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,377
Because I phoned Eric's parents,

855
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:08,914
and Oleg wasn't there,
either, so, I...

856
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:10,347
I know. I found him.

857
01:30:11,106 --> 01:30:14,019
He was with another friend.

858
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:17,579
Are you okay?

859
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,955
Yes, I'm fine now.

860
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:25,254
Mathias...

861
01:30:25,353 --> 01:30:28,357
I've got to run to one of
those boring dinners,

862
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:31,893
but I'll call you in the
morning, when I'm back. Okay?

863
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:44,212
Shit!

864
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:36,427
You couldn't have
asked another doctor?

865
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:37,629
What?

866
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:48,547
Two minutes,
ladies and gentlemen.

867
01:32:24,339 --> 01:32:26,376
Hello?

868
01:32:27,809 --> 01:32:28,981
Hello?

869
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:39,023
And to all our viewers
around the world, thank you

870
01:32:39,087 --> 01:32:42,398
for joining us here
tonight at the Hotel...

871
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:44,731
No! No!

872
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:47,866
No! Stop! No!

873
01:32:47,996 --> 01:32:50,237
No! No!

874
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:53,710
...of Beijing, Denver,
Oslo, and Montreal.

875
01:32:53,768 --> 01:32:54,838
No!

876
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:01,684
...as with every competition,
there can only be one winner.

877
01:33:08,349 --> 01:33:12,354
That the 15th Winter Sports
World Cup has been awarded to...

878
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,559
...three, two, one!

879
01:33:14,722 --> 01:33:16,963
...Oslo!

880
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:47,558
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

881
01:33:50,592 --> 01:33:52,230
Congrats to us all.

882
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:09,751
Whoo-hoo...

883
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:54,723
That's the last of
her files to download.

884
01:35:54,782 --> 01:35:57,854
There's nothing after that.

885
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:00,696
Get me a list of
all the phone calls

886
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:02,962
and appointments she made
while I was away.

887
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:06,032
Magnus!

888
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,107
Yeah, sure.

889
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:16,076
When was this taken?

890
01:36:16,137 --> 01:36:17,138
Two days ago.

891
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:19,582
- No, no, no!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

892
01:36:19,641 --> 01:36:21,314
I'm late to get her to school!
I have to get to work.

893
01:36:21,409 --> 01:36:23,548
I am sorry. I have one
quick question I need to ask you.

894
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:25,955
We have been over this
hundreds of times.

895
01:36:26,047 --> 01:36:27,958
I know we have been
over this 100 times,

896
01:36:28,049 --> 01:36:29,392
but I need to
sort something out.

897
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,828
Dr. Vetlesen was not
working at the clinic

898
01:36:31,919 --> 01:36:33,262
the day your wife was
supposed to see him.

899
01:36:33,321 --> 01:36:35,096
He wasn't there.

900
01:36:35,156 --> 01:36:37,500
- So, she got the day wrong.
- I...

901
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:40,799
- How... Josephine, in the car.
- Daddy!

902
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:43,739
How the hell am I supposed
to remember what day we saw him'?

903
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,608
Sir, I'm just trying to
find your wife. Please help me.

904
01:36:47,068 --> 01:36:50,015
How the hell am I supposed
to remember what day we saw him'?

905
01:36:50,104 --> 01:36:53,313
Sir, I'm just trying to
find your wife. Please help me.

906
01:36:53,408 --> 01:36:55,945
How the hell am I supposed
to remember what day we saw him'?

907
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:57,853
Sir, I'm trying
to find your wife.

908
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:00,152
How the hell am I supposed
to remember what day we saw him'?

909
01:37:00,248 --> 01:37:01,693
Sir, I'm trying
to find your wife.

910
01:37:01,783 --> 01:37:03,160
...what day we saw him?
Sir...

911
01:37:03,251 --> 01:37:04,594
what day we saw him? Sir...

912
01:37:06,087 --> 01:37:07,760
Yes, I want all those files.

913
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,165
Give me your car keys.

914
01:37:09,257 --> 01:37:11,100
What?
And your phone.

915
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:43,825
Yes?

916
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:49,874
You told me Vetlesen was your
wife's doctor when we spoke.

917
01:37:49,964 --> 01:37:53,343
And that you had no idea
why she'd gone to see him.

918
01:37:53,401 --> 01:37:54,471
Yes.

919
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:59,174
But you told my colleague
you both went to see him.

920
01:37:59,307 --> 01:38:02,049
She must have misheard me.

921
01:38:03,911 --> 01:38:06,152
She recorded the interview.

922
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:14,556
Darling, go back inside. I'll
come in in a minute, okay?

923
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:18,865
Good girl.

924
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:22,239
She isn't mine.

925
01:38:23,998 --> 01:38:28,105
Birte and I were trying
for another child.

926
01:38:28,202 --> 01:38:30,512
We thought it might
save our marriage.

927
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:34,249
We had blood tests done at the
clinic for hormone treatment,

928
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:37,118
and it came out that

929
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:41,522
she wasn't mine.

930
01:38:43,184 --> 01:38:45,186
I am infertile.

931
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:49,030
I've always been infertile.

932
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:51,866
Can't have children.

933
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:56,807
But she is mine.
Do you understand?

934
01:38:56,898 --> 01:38:59,208
How can I not love her?

935
01:39:02,737 --> 01:39:06,549
But you didn't see Vetlesen
the day you found out.

936
01:39:11,145 --> 01:39:14,922
No, we saw some
hormone specialist.

937
01:39:14,982 --> 01:39:16,928
A visiting consultant.

938
01:39:23,224 --> 01:39:25,727
Do you know his name?

939
01:39:33,167 --> 01:39:34,237
Yes?

940
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:39,307
Just a second.

941
01:39:40,842 --> 01:39:42,082
Damn it.

942
01:39:44,579 --> 01:39:46,616
I said I'm coming!

943
01:39:53,788 --> 01:39:55,267
You never called.

944
01:39:57,124 --> 01:39:58,967
Is Oleg back?

945
01:39:59,026 --> 01:40:00,471
What'? Oleg?

946
01:40:00,528 --> 01:40:03,668
He's at school.

947
01:40:03,764 --> 01:40:05,937
And Harry?

948
01:40:06,634 --> 01:40:08,136
Is Harry here?

949
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:11,207
No.

950
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:12,879
No...

951
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:18,215
How did he convince you
to give him those pills?

952
01:40:19,547 --> 01:40:20,890
He didn't.

953
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:24,530
You didn't have to do it for me'

954
01:40:24,619 --> 01:40:26,462
I didn't do it for you.

955
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:39,143
It was never about you.

956
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:54,383
I'm outside his house.

957
01:40:54,482 --> 01:40:57,691
I can't reach Rakel. Send
someone to her apartment.

958
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:23,547
Oleg.

959
01:41:23,611 --> 01:41:25,682
Sorry to keep you waiting.

960
01:41:45,299 --> 01:41:47,438
Why do you have Mum's phone?

961
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:52,580
Come on.

962
01:42:08,723 --> 01:42:10,999
You and I have more in common
than you think.

963
01:42:14,161 --> 01:42:18,234
I didn't know who
my father was, either.

964
01:42:34,849 --> 01:42:36,988
Magnus, track Rakel's phone.

965
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,497
Sorry, I just...

966
01:42:55,202 --> 01:42:56,203
All right.

967
01:42:58,272 --> 01:42:59,842
Okay, Harry, we just
picked up her signal,

968
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:02,113
heading west towards Telemark.

969
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:06,716
It is a red Volvo registered
to a Mathias Lund-Helgesen,

970
01:43:06,814 --> 01:43:08,555
Rjukan, 2421.

971
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:12,458
The house is pretty remote.

972
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,557
There's an access road,
but that's it.

973
01:43:14,655 --> 01:43:16,191
And there's a big lake
around it.

974
01:43:17,324 --> 01:43:19,235
Helicopters are grounded
because of the weather,

975
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:22,307
but Delta is on their way.

976
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:25,704
Anything on Mathias' family?

977
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,006
Okay, I've got something here.

978
01:43:27,068 --> 01:43:32,541
Jonas Lund-Helgesen, former police
officer, lost his job in '89.

979
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:35,314
A scandal involving a woman
drowning in a car.

980
01:43:35,376 --> 01:43:36,548
Probable suicide.

981
01:43:37,344 --> 01:43:38,687
She had a son.

982
01:43:38,746 --> 01:43:39,816
Stop!

983
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,325
Father unknown.

984
01:43:41,382 --> 01:43:42,417
Please!

985
01:43:42,516 --> 01:43:44,189
He was sent to an orphanage.

986
01:43:51,992 --> 01:43:53,403
Who led the investigation

987
01:43:53,494 --> 01:43:55,565
into the woman's disappearance?

988
01:43:55,663 --> 01:43:58,007
Some local talent
in the village nearby.

989
01:43:58,065 --> 01:44:01,171
What's his name?
Jonas Lund-Helgesen.

990
01:44:02,436 --> 01:44:06,350
Jonas! No, please, stop!

991
01:44:26,026 --> 01:44:27,027
Harry?

992
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:29,537
Harry? We've lost him.

993
01:46:28,015 --> 01:46:29,824
Sit down, Harry.

994
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:42,434
Pass me the gun.

995
01:46:52,573 --> 01:46:55,349
I didn't think you'd find me.

996
01:46:57,678 --> 01:47:00,386
Perhaps the pills helped,
after all.

997
01:47:02,349 --> 01:47:04,886
I spoke to Filip Becker.

998
01:47:08,055 --> 01:47:09,728
What's going to happen

999
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:13,704
when Josephine Becker finds
out he isn't her father?

1000
01:47:15,529 --> 01:47:17,440
She'll still love him.

1001
01:47:17,531 --> 01:47:18,601
Wrong answer.

1002
01:47:29,543 --> 01:47:32,422
Let's try again.

1003
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:37,622
Was it right for Sylvia Ottersen
to kill her unborn child

1004
01:47:37,718 --> 01:47:41,393
simply because she couldn't keep
track of who the father was?

1005
01:47:43,257 --> 01:47:44,964
That was her choice.

1006
01:47:47,728 --> 01:47:48,763
Too short.

1007
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:51,300
Maybe she was afraid.

1008
01:47:55,436 --> 01:47:57,177
What about you, Harry?

1009
01:47:59,073 --> 01:48:00,746
You have a woman who loves you.

1010
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:03,617
A boy who's devoted to you.

1011
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:07,752
Why did you abandon them?

1012
01:48:10,284 --> 01:48:13,595
They deserve better.

1013
01:48:14,588 --> 01:48:15,589
Too easy.

1014
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:19,597
Because I'm selfish.

1015
01:48:23,197 --> 01:48:25,370
I'm an addict.

1016
01:48:28,035 --> 01:48:30,538
There isn't enough room
for them.

1017
01:48:46,954 --> 01:48:50,231
You know, when I first
saw your picture in the paper

1018
01:48:52,292 --> 01:48:54,203
with all those medals,

1019
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:59,643
I thought, "That man must
have a perfect family."

1020
01:49:06,173 --> 01:49:09,017
And here you are.

1021
01:49:09,643 --> 01:49:10,883
Last question.

1022
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:13,915
This boy,

1023
01:49:14,815 --> 01:49:17,318
who doesn't even know
who his father is,

1024
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:21,055
who's had to put up
with so many men

1025
01:49:21,155 --> 01:49:23,533
like you and me
taking his place...

1026
01:49:27,661 --> 01:49:31,006
Does his mother deserve to live?

1027
01:49:35,035 --> 01:49:37,015
Why don't you ask him?

1028
01:50:21,381 --> 01:50:23,725
You all right?

1029
01:50:25,986 --> 01:50:29,991
Kill him.

1030
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:31,228
Kill him!

1031
01:51:07,928 --> 01:51:09,100
Come on!

1032
01:51:10,697 --> 01:51:15,168
I'm ready! I'm here!

1033
01:51:15,269 --> 01:51:16,339
Come on!

1034
01:51:49,136 --> 01:51:52,481
I know why you blame her.

1035
01:52:01,248 --> 01:52:05,492
You've been wrong
the whole time.

1036
01:52:10,657 --> 01:52:12,830
It wasn't her.

1037
01:52:18,665 --> 01:52:21,771
It wasn't your mother
who didn't want you.

1038
01:52:23,837 --> 01:52:25,714
It was your father.

1039
01:52:29,009 --> 01:52:31,956
It would've been better for him

1040
01:52:35,082 --> 01:52:36,618
had you not been born.

1041
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:03,011
The pathologist detected
traces of the drug, ketanome.

1042
01:54:03,103 --> 01:54:05,310
But the direct cause
of death was drowning

1043
01:54:05,372 --> 01:54:07,545
as a result of
blood filling her lungs.

1044
01:54:07,708 --> 01:54:10,348
Twenty-four stab wounds
were found in her mouth,

1045
01:54:10,444 --> 01:54:14,654
all at regular intervals and at the
same depth, seven centimeters.

1046
01:54:14,715 --> 01:54:17,286
Pathologist can't determine
what kind of weapon was used.

1047
01:54:18,452 --> 01:54:21,661
And he's never seen
anything like it.

1048
01:54:21,722 --> 01:54:23,861
I'll take it.

1048
01:54:24,305 --> 01:55:24,307
