1
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,000
Valhalla, this is Thor.
Valhalla, this is Thor.

2
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,400
<i>We have visual on</i>
<i>a possible high-value target.</i>

3
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Thor, this is Valhalla.

4
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,500
We're seeking positive ID
on target traveling in convoy

5
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,700
and we're pushing
more assets your way.

6
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,000
Contact Loki on secondary net.

7
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,000
Loki, this is Thor.

8
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,300
<i>Target is located at grid coordinates</i>
<i>two-four-Tango-Kilo-Bravo</i>

9
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,700
<i>one-two-four-five-six-seven-three-niner.</i>

10
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,500
<i>Confirm you have visual.</i>

11
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,000
Verifying target ID.

12
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,100
Electro-optic and
infrared sensors are online.

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,700
- Confirming target.
- SecDef is arriving now.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,300
Mr. Secretary, this way, sir.

15
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,300
Attempting cell phone link
to moving target.

16
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Stand by for data feed.

17
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,500
Stand by for audio.

18
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
Got it.

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,200
Now, don't tell me you spotted the beard
in the middle of a goddamn sandstorm.

20
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,500
- Is it really him?
- We're confirming that now, sir.

21
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,700
Sir, audio is coming up now.

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,900
- Verifying voice pattern match.
- What do we have here, Sergeant?

23
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,400
Four males. One of them is speaking
in a Rakhshani dialect,

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,100
consistent with our intel on al-Khoei.

25
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,500
Sir, it's just coming up.

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,100
"Thirty-seven percent" and "probable"
don't belong in the same sentence.

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,700
I'm not taking this to the President.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,900
<i>CIA and NCTC concur it is the target,</i>

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,800
<i>based on reliable intel from the Brits.</i>

30
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,200
They're pulling off the highway.

31
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,800
Criteria is not met. Recommend abort.

32
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,700
We have an abort recommendation.

33
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,600
If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding
every couple of years at best.

34
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,100
Sir, target is appearing
around the northeast corner.

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,100
We've got AK-47 s,
RPGs and Chaparral guided missiles.

36
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,000
This is a training camp, Mr. Secretary.

37
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,400
- Wait. Wait. Print. 51%.
- 51%.

38
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,400
- Abort rec still holds.
- All other PID options exhausted.

39
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,800
What do you suggest we do, sir?

40
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,300
Is that a weapons cache?

41
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Sir, the placement of
the stones around the pit,

42
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,000
marker for the five pillars of Islam.
I think it's a funeral.

43
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,500
For Christ's sake.

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,700
Counsel, how many ways would this
violate the Geneva Convention?

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,700
We can invoke <i>hors de combat.</i>

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
There's no independent intel verifying
that this is, in fact, a funeral.

47
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,100
Signal's got the President
from Air Force One, sir.

48
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,900
Mr. President,

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,800
we have a 51% identity match
on Majid al-Khoei.

50
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,400
<i>The bad news is, there's</i>
<i>some possibility he's at a funeral.</i>

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,200
You should also be aware
we have an abort recommendation.

52
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,900
But the Joint Chiefs are urging a go.

53
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,300
<i>All right, what's your recommendation?</i>

54
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,400
Sir, we measure success by
the least amount of collateral damage.

55
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,500
At 51% probability, the risk is too high.

56
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,200
<i>And if it is al-Khoei and he walks,</i>
<i>I'm putting our people at risk.</i>

57
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,700
<i>You have a go.</i>

58
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,500
Thank you, Mr. President.

59
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,500
- We're weapons hot!
- We have weapons hot!

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
- Loki, you are cleared to engage.
- Repeat, weapons hot. PID.

61
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,500
We have handshake with the
MQ9 Reaper. Sending you images now.

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,000
- Loki, target coordinates received.
- Yes, sir. Switching to IR sensor.

63
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,900
Target is lased.

64
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,600
Master arm on.

65
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,200
Missiles away.

66
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,200
Ten seconds to impact.

67
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,400
You got to make a choice, fellas.

68
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,000
Who are you going to be? Boys or men?

69
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,900
- I'm out on this one.
- Why?

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,300
- 'Cause I'm broke.
- Come...

71
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,100
How do I know you don't have
something great under there?

72
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,600
Kwame just paired the board.
I'm floating on the river here.

73
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,800
Look at the table.

74
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,700
I don't know. I'm supposed to take my
girl out later. It's a lot of money.

75
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,000
Your girl out? Who's that?

76
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,600
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
You guys have been going out
for a while.

78
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,200
How long?

79
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,600
- Couple months.
- Couple months? Wow.

80
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,900
- That's big. You have sex with her yet?
- Kinda.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,300
- What the hell is "kinda"?
- "Kinda"?

82
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,600
- Personal question.
- Okay, well, listen.

83
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,000
Let me ask you a question.
What are you going to do tonight?

84
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Fish filet and a Coke?

85
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,800
Go to Blockbuster,
rent a little romantic comedy,

86
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,600
go back to Mom's house,
sit on the couch?

87
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,000
- How'd you know?
- Well, that's what you do.

88
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,800
You're a dependable person.
That's what you're going to do.

89
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,500
You know what you should do?

90
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,900
You need to lay down some real green
and treat your lady right.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
You know, you need to take her
to a nice place.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,100
Red Lobster. Olive Garden.
Tablecloths. Soft music.

93
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
And then you skip
this Blockbuster thing.

94
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,200
Girls want to go out. Especially a girl
as cute as your girl, you know?

95
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
She wants to be seen.
That's why she dresses up.

96
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,000
So you take her to the movies.

97
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,600
- A little popcorn-drink combo.
- True. True.

98
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Elaine might want a hot dog and some
nachos, so you shell out for that, too.

99
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,200
And then before you know it,

100
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,500
she's cozying up
the way she never would've

101
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,700
at her mom's house, you know?

102
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,200
- Preach it. Preach it.
- Now all of a sudden, look.

103
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,700
Gino Romero's walking tall
with Elaine yank-my-Dickinson,

104
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,700
- all because he dared to dream tonight.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

105
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,000
And he became a man.
And that's the choice.

106
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,600
- Yes.
- And that's what's on the table.

107
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,100
This is the dream right here.

108
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,600
Are you a man?

109
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,900
- I'm with you.
- Okay, here we go.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
- I'm with you. Twenty?
- Twenty.

111
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
Big boy game.

112
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,500
Call.

113
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,300
- Cowboys over aces, big Jer.
- Wow. Wow.

114
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,900
- Didn't see that coming, huh?
- Yeah, that's a tough one.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,100
This is a tough one, too.
Four bullets, baby.

116
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,900
Get out of here!
You baited me into that, Jer. Come on!

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
- That's the way it goes.
- So what happened to Red Lobster?

118
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,700
No, I guess it's Mama's house
for you tonight.

119
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,100
But look, I saved you 40 bucks.

120
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,600
And now Elaine won't have to shell out
for herpes medication.

121
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,100
Break's over, bitches.
Freitag missed his shift again.

122
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,300
- Someone's on collator duty.
- Great.

123
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,300
All right, well, gentlemen,

124
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
I'll give you a chance to win some of
this back tomorrow. Enjoy yourselves.

125
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,800
All right, man.

126
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,800
Hey there. Welcome to Copy Cabana.
How can I help you?

127
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,100
I couldn't get the machine
past the main menu.

128
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,800
- That machine there?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
Did you swipe your credit card
to the left, sir?

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
- Didn't do that.
- Well, that's your problem.

131
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
Why don't you try it again?

132
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
<i>Cell phone users, beware.</i>

133
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,700
<i>The Federal Bureau of Investigation</i>

<i>Watch your step, please.</i>

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,000

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes.

143

Jerry?

147
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,800
Mrs. Wierzbowski! I was just...
I thought you might have been sleeping.

148
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,300
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So... But I have...

149
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,200
I have some rent here.

150
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,400
- Here you go.
- Yeah, some is good. All is better.

151
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,400
Well, that's most of it. Here.

152
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,800
$1, $1, $1...

153
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,500
No, no, no. Look. Here's a five there.

154
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,700
- Five.
- Yeah.

155
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,800
Where is girl? I don't see her no more.

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
You know you're the only woman for me.

157
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,100
No, that's done. She got smart.

158
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,100
- Like the others.
- Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Is woman friend? Answer.
Then see if she give you money for rent.

160
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,600
One second.

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
Hey, Mom.

162
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,200
What?

163
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
- Looks just like him.
- I'm not him.

164
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,700
Six months without a boo or a bah, huh?

165
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,200
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,500
So where were you this time?

167
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,300
Alaska. Singapore.
I got a job there.

168
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,500
I... I spoke to Stanford.

169
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
I pulled some strings.

170
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,500
They said they'd take you back.
Even though you took off...

171
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,800
Two years ago, Dad.

172
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,500
Jerry, you know, it wouldn't kill you
to ask for help once in a while.

173
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,900
You want to have
this conversation now?

174
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,100
- It's Stanford!
- You want to do this today.

175
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
You know how many people would kill...

176
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,500
- Today? You want to have this now?
- Fine.

177
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,800
You do whatever you want.
You always have.

178
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,700
You know, I keep thinking,
I'm going to walk in here one day

179
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,400
and I'm not going to feel
like a stranger in my own house.

180
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
I don't want your money.

181
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,700
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

182
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,100
<i>Smoking is not permitted on the train.</i>
<i>Chicago is next.</i>

183
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,700
Can't find the keys
and he's late as usual.

184
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
- I'm going to have to take you.
- He'll be here.

185
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
All right, wait five more minutes.

186
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Help me out here.
We came home last night.

187
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,800
I put the leftovers down.
You turned on the TV. I went over,

188
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,500
said, "No TV, no TV, no TV."
Turned it off.

189
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,700
Came over here.

190
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
- Checked the messages.
- Knocked over the phone.

191
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,300
Right, knocked over the phone.
Put it back.

192
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,700
Put the leftovers in the fridge.

193
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Let's go!

194
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,000
I put vitamins in your toiletry bag.
Don't forget to take...

195
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,800
- Two in the morning and two at night.
- That's right.

196
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,800
And your inhaler's
in the back of your bag.

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
- Sammy!
- Daddy!

198
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,700
Come here. You didn't think
I'd miss the big send-off, do you, huh?

199
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,100
Let's get you on this train.

200
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,800
- This must be your...
- Trumpet.

201
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
My God, this weighs, like, 200 pounds.
You carry this yourself?

202
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,700
- Mr. and Mrs. Holloman!
- Miss.

203
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
- You just made it.
- Right.

204
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,900
- Here, Sam.
- Thanks.

205
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
- Listen to me.
- I have one more here.

206
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,900
All these other kids, right? They're
going to call their moms, too, all right?

207
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,700
They're just going to lie about it.

208
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,700
All right, and eat junk food 'cause this is
your one chance, but brush your teeth.

209
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,000
Mom, you got to stop.
I'm going to miss you, too.

210
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,700
<i>Capitol Limited to D.C. is</i>
<i>departing now.</i>

211
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,900
Give me a hug.

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
<i>All aboard.</i>

213
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

214
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
- Shine bright, okay?
- Okay.

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,800
Rock the house, buddy.
You're going to be great. Okay?

216
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,200
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

217
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,900
- Bye!
- Have fun in D.C.!

218
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,700
- Bye, Mom!
- Your mom going to be okay?

219
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,200
It's unclear.

220
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,500
I'm so sorry. I got stuck in traffic,

221
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,700
- and I didn't even...
- Don't even say it.

222
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,400
All aboard!

223
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Yes. Five-nine-one-three.

224
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,800
It's here. It's here.

225
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,500
Okay, okay.

226
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,000
- Come on!
- Two seconds. Sorry.

227
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,900
No, wait.

228
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,500
- Hey, hang on a second.
- Sorry.

229
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
- You're dropping money.
- Sir, sir!

230
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,700
Big date, you know?
Fingers crossed, huh?

231
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,000
- Here you go. Have a good day!
- Thank you.

232
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,500
- Jerry!
- What?

233
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,400
- So many boxes.
- Boxes?

234
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,000
I had to open your room.
All day they come.

235
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,500
- Big boxes, small boxes.
- My boxes?

236
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't know.
Whose boxes would they be?

237
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,400
- All right, okay.
- Look at them there. See in there?

238
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
- See, I put them all...
- Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,800
- Listen, I have something for you here.
- Yeah.

240
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,900
This is rent for this month
and next month, too, okay?

241
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,700
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

242
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,300
Hello?

243
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,000
<i>The FBI will arrive</i>
<i>at your apartment in 30 seconds.</i>

244
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,700
<i>You must flee the premises.</i>

245
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,000
Who... Who is this?

246
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,600
<i>You've been activated, Jerry.</i>

247
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,600
- Who the hell is this?
- <i>Your compliance is vital.</i>

248
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
How did you get this number?

249
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,700
<i>You now have 24 seconds.</i>
<i>Leave your residence.</i>

250
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,300
<i>Your destination, the Mathis train</i>
<i>station. We will guide you from there.</i>

251
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
What is this?

252
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,700
<i>The evidence in your</i>
<i>apartment is irrefutable.</i>

253
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
- Listen.
- <i>17 seconds.</i>

254
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,900
I'm going to hang this phone up now.

255
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
<i>They'll seek your arrest</i>
<i>for conspiracy, treason...</i>

256
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,400
- I'm hanging this phone up now!
- <i>... violating state and local law.</i>

257
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,300
- You tell me how you got this number!
- <i>Maximum penalty, death.</i>

258
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
No, none of this is mine!

259
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,800
FBI, FBI, FBI! Get down on the floor!

260
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,600
Get on the ground!

261
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,500
Down now! Get down!

262
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,900
- I didn't do anything!
- Get down!

263
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,100
- Listen!
- Don't move.

264
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,600
It's not mine! It's not mine!

265
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,100
This is obviously
some sort of mistake, right?

266
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,100
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing in this room, sir.

267
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
It's cold as hell outside.

268
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,600
- You draw?
- I what?

269
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,300
Do you draw? Do you sketch?
You have ink all over your fingers.

270
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,100
Look, you know you got
the wrong guy, right?

271
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,500
I mean,
this is all some kind of sick joke.

272
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,800
- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- Obviously.

273
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,900
Obviously you have
nothing to do with it, yeah.

274
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Did you love your brother?

275
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,600
Or did you hate him?
Did you admire him?

276
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,400
Was your brother patriotic,
would you say?

277
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,900
When's the last time you saw him?

278
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,900
- Christmas.
- This past Christmas?

279
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,400
- Three Christmases ago.
- Three years, huh?

280
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,100
Well, the phone records show that you
haven't even called him in over a year.

281
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,000
So no text messages?
No smoke signals?

282
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,600
No MySpace or Facebook messages?

283
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,200
Yeah, so what are you trying to say?
We're not...

284
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,500
Are you asking if we're the type of twins

285
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,100
that wear the same shirt to the mall,
hold hands, and things like that? No.

286
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,200
- Sir, I don't even know your name.
- I'm sorry, that was rude of me.

287
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,500
I'm Tom Morgan,

288
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,000
the Supervising Agent assigned
to the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

289
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,800
You think I'm a terrorist?

290
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,100
No, you're a copy boy, aren't you?

291
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,800
- I'm a copy associate.
- Copy associate.

292
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,800
But your brother,

293
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,100
it says here he was a little more,
I guess you'd say, ambitious than you.

294
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
Graduated from
the Air Force Academy at 21,

295
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,100
with an advanced degree in parallel
algorithms and quantum electronics.

296
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,400
I don't even know what the hell
that stuff means. Do you?

297
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,000
Cadet wing commander, valedictorian,
plum job in the Public Affairs...

298
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,800
Yeah, no, I know what he did, sir.

299
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,400
Why'd you drop out of school, Jerry?

300
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,800
Did your brother have
any influence on that decision?

301
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,300
No, school just wasn't for me.

302
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,800
No, I mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?

303
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,900
More upward mobility
at Copy Cabana, I guess, right?

304
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,100
I see you did a little backpacking.
Singapore, Bali, Indonesia.

305
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,500
Did odd jobs here and there.
So you've been around.

306
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,700
Look, none of this has anything to do

307
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,900
with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.

308
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,100
Why would I send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.

309
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,400
I'd have to be the dumbest terrorist
in the history of the world.

310
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,900
So who deposited the 750?

311
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,300
The...
I don't know who deposited the 750!

312
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,700
God maybe? I thought it was a miracle,

313
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,000
I took the money. That was my mistake.
It was an accident.

314
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,800
Do accidents not happen
in your universe?

315
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,900
Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...

316
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,900
Well, I'll be darned, Singapore.

317
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,900
Opened with a transfer from
a corporation called The Star of Orion,

318
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,200
- a dummy front for Hezbollah.
- This is all very interesting, sir.

319
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,300
- It has nothing to do with me.
- We find hardware in your apartment.

320
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,300
Latest military spec.

321
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,600
- Airplane manuals.
- I told you about this already.

322
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,400
And 1,200 pounds
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

323
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
I walked into my apartment...

324
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,300
You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?

325
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,800
I walk into my apartment,
I open the door,

326
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,100
and this shit's all over my apartment.

327
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,600
- It just showed up.
- It just showed up.

328
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,500
I see. I'm just curious
if your brother knew anything about it.

329
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,700
Of course, we haven't really established
how close you guys were yet, have we?

330
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,600
Well, we were pretty close this morning
when I buried his body in the ground.

331
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,300
Does that establish anything for you?
Somebody set me up.

332
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,700
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

333
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,300
- "Somebody."
- A woman called me on the phone.

334
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,500
She told me I was going to be arrested.

335
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,900
"A woman." Your mom? Who?

336
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,600
I don't know! If I knew, I would tell you!
I don't know!

337
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,100
Here's the thing, Jerry.

338
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,400
This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.

339
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,200
You read the paper.

340
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,400
Who do you think is winning?

341
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,300
Your Miranda rights or my right to keep
you in this room as long as I want to?

342
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,300
I don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.

343
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,600
I don't care who you work for.

344
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,200
'Cause no matter what you tell me,
you're in a shitload of trouble, son.

345
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,500
This is insane. I work for Copy Cabana.

346
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Yeah, that's what you said.

347
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,600
Listen, I get one night out
in a decade, ladies,

348
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
I am not wasting it on Lemon Drops.

349
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,900
- Okay.
- Buck up. Let's go.

350
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,800
Oh, gosh.

351
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,700
I want updates. Catfights, booty calls,
somebody tell me they got lucky.

352
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,000
Hey, ladies. See that guy over there?
He'd like to buy you a round.

353
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,400
Hell, no.
He's got light beer written all over him.

354
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,600
- He's cute.
- Come on.

355
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,800
He's a suit. No.

356
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,100
You sure?

357
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
- Come on.
- Who is it?

358
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,300
The one man in my life
who hasn't let me down.

359
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,500
- That's sweet.
- All right, don't drink those without me.

360
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,700
Hello?

361
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,500
Hello?

362
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,100
<i>There's a McDonald's across the street.</i>
<i>Look in the window.</i>

363
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,300
What is this?

364
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,000
<i>Would you risk your life for your son?</i>

365
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,500
<i>Rachel Holloman,</i>
<i>you've been activated.</i>

366
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,400
- This isn't funny.
- <i>Your compliance is vital.</i>

367
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
- Who are you?
- <i>We will derail his train,</i>

368
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
<i>unless you do what you're told.</i>

369
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
What is this?

370
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,200
<i>Don't go back inside the restaurant.</i>

371
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,800
- What?
- <i>There's a black Porsche Cayenne</i>

372
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,600
<i>parked at the northeast corner</i>
<i>of this block.</i>

373
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,900
<i>The keys are in the ignition.</i>
<i>Start walking.</i>

374
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,900
Oh, my God.

375
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,100
<i>911.</i>
<i>State the nature of your emergency.</i>

376
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Yeah, some woman just called me.
I have... I have no idea who she is.

377
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
She was telling me that...

378
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,600
<i>Your phone is being monitored.</i>
<i>Disobey again and your son dies.</i>

379
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,300
Hey, Grant, I can't read this Shaw file.

380
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
- Grant!
- Excuse me.

381
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,700
Listen, my eyes aren't getting any better
and these screens are getting smaller.

382
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,300
Could you please find me
something I can read?

383
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,900
I can make the text bigger
on your screen.

384
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,500
No, no, no. I'm talking about paper.

385
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,000
Remember, like in the olden times?

386
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,600
- Paper. Okay.
- Yeah.

387
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,600
Agent Morgan. Zoe Perez,
Air Force Special Investigations.

388
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,100
Ethan Shaw, the twin,
he was one of ours.

389
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,900
Yeah.
OSI said they were sending a liaison.

390
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,700
Can you walk and talk
at the same time?

391
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,100
I'll do my best.

392
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,100
File says he died in a traffic accident.

393
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,000
Truck ran a light, corner of
Constitution and 10th, Northwest D.C.

394
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,400
So truck ran a light,
his brother gets 750 large

395
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,600
and enough hardware
to start his own Costco,

396
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,200
five hours after enemy
chatter hits the roof.

397
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,100
I mean, don't you find that
a little coincidental?

398
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,900
<i>What if it's a decoy? To distract us from</i>
<i>something 50 times bigger.</i>

399
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,600
- Time for your phone call.
- I thought I didn't get one.

400
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,600
Attorney General's office
changed their mind.

401
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,700
Ethan Shaw had a 183 IQ

402
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,100
and yet you had him
as a mid-level press flak.

403
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,800
Why not IT or cyber-warfare?

404
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?

405
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,400
Or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the Copy Cabana?

406
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,300
No, I'm suggesting
that maybe Ethan Shaw

407
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,500
was a superstar rocket scientist genius
who did go wrong,

408
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,200
and the Air Force doesn't want
their dirty laundry flapping in the wind.

409
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,000
Think what you like, but I need to get in
that room and interrogate him myself.

410
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,100
No.

411
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,200
You don't have a choice. Look.

412
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,400
Now, neither of us know if either of
those brothers are guilty or innocent,

413
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,200
so on behalf of the Secretary
of the Air Force, I'm going in that room.

414
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,700
Well, on behalf of
all that fucking bomb equipment

415
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,800
in junior pinhead's apartment,
no, you're not.

416
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,600
<i>We told you to run.</i>
<i>We have planned your escape.</i>

417
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,600
How'd you get on this phone?
Who are you?

418
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,600
<i>Lay flat on the floor immediately.</i>

419
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,100
What the...
What the hell are you talking about?

420
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,300
<i>Four seconds, Jerry.</i>

421
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,600
- No, this is bullshit. I don't...
- <i>Get down now.</i>

422
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,000
<i>Two seconds.</i>

423
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
No!

424
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,600
- No! I didn't do this!
- Get down!

425
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,000
Shit.

426
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,100
<i>Standing passengers,</i>
<i>please do not lean against the doors.</i>

427
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,100
<i>... fourteen Americans dead</i>
<i>throughout Europe and the Middle East,</i>

428
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,000
<i>with terror groups insisting</i>
<i>this is just the beginning</i>

429
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,200
<i>of a campaign the West invited</i>
<i>when it allegedly rained bombs</i>

00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,300
<i>on a religious ceremony</i>
<i>outside the small town of Abda,</i>

431
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,700
<i>near the border of Afghanistan.</i>

432
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,800
<i>Stay on the train for three more stations</i>
<i>and wait at the bottom of the platform.</i>

433
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,700
<i>You will receive...</i>

434
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,900
<i>Doors closing. Standing passengers,</i>
<i>please do not lean against the doors.</i>

435
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,700
- Help!
- Jimmy.

436
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,700
My baby. I need some help. Somebody.

437
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,400
- What?
- <i>You're not listening.</i>

438
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,200
<i>We told you to stay on the train.</i>

439
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,000
- How are you doing this?
- <i>Next stop is Wilson Station.</i>

440
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,800
<i>A black Porsche Cayenne will be</i>
<i>waiting at the northwest exit.</i>

441
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,400
- Listen.
- <i>Get in the passenger seat.</i>

442
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,000
Listen! No, I'm done.

443
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,300
- Hello?
- <i>The man in front of the exit door</i>

444
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,900
<i>in a black coat is a wanted terrorist.</i>

445
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,100
- <i>His name is Jerry Shaw.</i>
- Who is this?

446
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,900
- You Jerry Shaw?
- No, no, no.

447
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
<i>Wilson Station. Exit now.</i>

448
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,000
That's the guy!

449
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,900
I said, are you Jerry Shaw?
Hey! Come here!

450
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,300
Watch it!

451
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,600
- Drive the car! Drive the car!
- No!

452
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,300
- I did what you asked me to do!
- I'm not going anywhere...

453
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,900
- You tell... Stop!
...until you tell me my son's safe!

454
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,900
Who's your son?
I don't know what you're talking about!

455
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
- I'll kill you if you hurt my son!
- I almost died over this shit!

456
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,900
- Listen, lady, I don't know who...
- Tell me Sam is safe!

457
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
Who is... Will you stop hitting me?

458
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,100
Are you the woman
who called me on the phone?

459
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,500
- Did you call me on the phone?
- No. The woman.

460
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,100
- She called you, too?
- She called you, too?

461
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,400
<i>Drive.</i>

462
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,400
Get out! Now! Get out of the vehicle!

463
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,100
Stop!

464
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,700
- Why is this happening?
- Go, go, go, go, go!

465
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,700
Who are you and
why are people shooting at us?

466
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,200
Drive the car! Clutch!

467
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,800
<i>Accelerate. Turn right, 200 feet.</i>
<i>You have pursuers.</i>

468
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,700
- Yeah, no shit! Who are you?
- <i>No questions.</i>

469
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,200
<i>Turn right now.</i>

470
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,100
So you don't know anything about Sam?

471
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,100
What, you mean your son?
No, I know nothing.

472
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Just like you don't know how to drive.

473
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,000
Use the clutch before you shift,
not while you shift!

474
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,100
I don't need driving lessons
from you, asshole!

475
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,100
What, you drive like this
and I'm the asshole?

476
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,700
<i>Turn left now.</i>

477
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,200
All units. Suspect in a Porsche
Cayenne heading west on Grand.

478
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,900
- All units respond, Code 3.
- There!

479
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,700
<i>Maintain a speed of 50 miles an hour.</i>
<i>Stay in the second lane from the right.</i>

480
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,200
- The light's red!
- <i>Accelerate now.</i>

481
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,800
Get me a roadblock
at Granville and Sheridan.

482
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,200
Oh, shit.

483
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,000
The lights are all turning green.

484
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,000
Holy shit!

485
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,700
- Holy...
- Shit!

486
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,800
Get in close.

487
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,200
Go, go, go!

488
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,800
- Shit!
- <i>Brake. Brake now.</i>

489
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,900
Get in here!

490
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,000
<i>Accelerate to 60 miles per hour.</i>

491
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,300
Clutch. Clutch!

492
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,100
- Use the clutch!
- I'm clutching!

493
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,700
I'm watching, you're not clutching!

494
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,000
- Stop!
- I'm not stopping.

495
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,100
Slow down. Slow down, the light's red.

496
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,200
<i>Don't slow down.</i>
<i>Accelerate to 72 miles per hour.</i>

497
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,200
- Slow down. It's a red light!
- <i>You will make it through.</i>

498
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,800
- Stop!
- No way.

499
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,100
- Brake!
- I can't!

500
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,500
- Brake!
- Stop!

501
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,300
<i>Manual control's been restored.</i>

502
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,700
<i>Continue straight</i>
<i>until you reach Pier 15.</i>

503
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,300
<i>Enter the wrecking yard.</i>
<i>Proceed to the end of the dock.</i>

504
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,100
<i>We will eliminate all obstacles for you.</i>

505
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,600
Watch! Watch! Watch!

506
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,700
- <i>Stay your course.</i>
- Turn!

507
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,500
- Turn!
- <i>Turn right now.</i>

508
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,600
Holy...

509
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,300
Oh, God.

510
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Oh, my God!

511
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,300
- Grab the seat.
- I can't.

512
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,800
- Grab the seat! The seat!
- No, I can't!

513
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,800
No!

514
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,500
<i>The crane will release the car.</i>
<i>If you do not jump, you will drown.</i>

515
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,800
- We have to jump.
- No! No way.

516
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,700
We have to. When I say "go."

517
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Ready?

518
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,900
Go! Jump!

519
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
I want both the divers in that water!

520
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,200
- Let's go! Move!
- Let's go, let's go!

521
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,500
Move, move, move!

522
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,200
- Yeah, I already called it in!
- Wait till it clears!

523
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,300
Thirty feet back, that's it!

524
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,900
Yeah, I know,
the Army sent a Black Hawk,

525
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,400
so I'll be there in a couple of hours.

526
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,400
What do you mean,
the car is not registered to anyone?

527
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,700
Check the VIN number again.

528
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,900
<i>Leave your message for Sam,</i>
<i>even though I know it's you, Mom.</i>

529
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,300
Sam? Baby, listen to me.

530
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,300
You need to call me
as soon as you get this message, okay?

531
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,700
Baby, please. I love you.

532
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,400
- What about the girl?
- What?

533
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,100
What about the girl?

534
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Well, the Department of Transpo
tells me that there was

535
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,700
a seven-minute equipment failure
on their traffic cams.

536
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,500
- We didn't get a picture of her.
- Don't tell me that.

537
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,100
- That's what they're telling me!
- I need an ID on that girl.

538
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,000
Do you think they could derail a train?

539
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,700
They changed every traffic light
to get us here.

540
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,600
The woman, she called me
on a stranger's cell phone

541
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,900
who happened to be sitting next to me.
Never met the guy in my life.

542
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,900
You know, and then they broke me out
of maximum security custody

543
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,300
in a way I'm not even gonna describe
to you because it sounds crazy,

544
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,000
and then they lift us off the face of
the Earth and drop us into this shit pile?

545
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,300
She could probably derail a train.

546
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,100
She could probably turn a train
into a talking duck.

547
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,100
And what about these goddamn ghost
cranes that keep helping peewee out?

548
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,100
I mean, they don't just lift cars
up in the air all by themselves

549
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,700
like a giant pair of chopsticks.

550
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,800
I want to know how these things run,
how they're programmed.

551
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,400
What'd you say your name was?

552
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,600
- Rachel.
- I'm Jerry.

553
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,000
- Hello?
- <i>The barge will dock in 14 minutes.</i>

554
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,400
<i>Leave the boatyard with the female.</i>
<i>Take Highway 123 East.</i>

555
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,100
<i>Walk to mile marker 108.</i>

556
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,900
- What? Was it her?
- She called you "the female."

557
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,500
Have Mortuary Affairs freeze everything
belonging to Ethan Shaw.

558
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,900
- No personal effects to next of kin.
- You, Due Process!

559
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,800
- Bye.
- What do you have on Ethan Shaw?

560
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,600
I have a name. It's Agent Perez.

561
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,900
And I'll answer that question
when I get back from D.C.

562
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,400
- Wait a minute. What's in D.C.?
- Shaw's private quarters.

563
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,400
I need you to stay here.
I'm not losing my link to Ethan Shaw.

564
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
Maybe I haven't made this clear.

565
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,600
I don't work for you.
I work for the Air Force.

566
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,500
Keep your phone on,
I'll keep you updated.

567
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
If you're staring at me, it better be
because I'm the goddamn suspect.

568
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,800
Because if I don't get some good leads
soon, you're all gonna be demoted

569
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,200
into something that's gonna require
touching shit with your hands.

570
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,400
Now, let's get going. We got work to do.

571
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,600
Hexamethylene.
Our latest chemical explosive.

572
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,200
One single tiny crystal,
80 times more powerful than C4.

573
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,600
Odorless, undetectable.

574
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,300
<i>And best of all, it can be</i>
<i>cut down in size for stealth operations.</i>

575
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,300
This valve is a sonic trigger.

576
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,700
<i>The sound frequency</i>
<i>triggers the explosion.</i>

577
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,000
Each trigger is programmed
to have a unique

578
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,700
frequency specific
only to one Hex crystal.

579
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
<i>That frequency triggers the explosion.</i>

580
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,300
<i>Yeah.</i>

581
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,300
We recently received approval
to begin shipping to the field.

582
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,200
Two hundred units
are shipping out today.

583
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,800
- Sign right here.
- Yeah.

584
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,400
Thank you.

585
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,300
<i>The package you've just received</i>
<i>contains a small metal valve.</i>

586
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,900
<i>Open the package.</i>

587
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,200
- Okay.
- <i>Remove the valve</i>

588
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,600
<i>and follow our instructions precisely.</i>

589
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,300
- <i>You've received the package.</i>
- <i>Yes, ma'am, it just arrived.</i>

590
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,700
- What kind of stone is this?
- <i>No questions.</i>

591
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,400
<i>Cut the stone and place the setting</i>

592
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,700
<i>according to the specifications</i>
<i>we sent you.</i>

593
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,700
<i>I'd just dropped my son off at the train.</i>

594
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,600
<i>I was out having drinks with my</i>
<i>girlfriends when the call came.</i>

595
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,300
- <i>What about you?</i>
- <i>The first call came to my apartment.</i>

596
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,600
- <i>After the boxes?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

597
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,200
Well, then this whole thing's
obviously gotta be about your brother.

598
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,400
- Really, it's that obvious, huh?
- I mean, you got all this stuff.

599
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,000
The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.

600
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,200
- Okay.
- He was your twin.

601
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,300
- They sent it to the wrong brother.
- Right.

602
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,600
So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.

603
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,300
I'm implying, if not him, then why you?

604
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,900
I'm sorry. I know he just died. I'm not
trying to insult his memory or anything.

605
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,900
No, he hasn't been dead long enough
to be a memory, Rachel.

606
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,100
If you knew my brother,
you'd laugh all day at the idea

607
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,300
that he was a terrorist or a spy
or whatever else you're saying...

608
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,500
- How do you know?
- Because he's my brother.

609
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,800
That's something you would know
about your brother.

610
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,200
Well, when's the last time
you talked to him?

611
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,300
I don't need this. Hey, listen. Hey!
I don't have to explain myself to you.

612
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,200
- Is your son a terrorist?
- Yeah, my son's a terrorist.

613
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,400
Yeah, well, he's just as likely
to be a terrorist as my brother.

614
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,200
And let's not forget you in all this. Why
are you here? What's your day job?

615
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,000
- I know it isn't manual shift driver.
- I'm a paralegal.

616
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,900
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

617
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,200
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

618
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,500
How do I know you're not lying to me?
What does a paralegal do?

619
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,400
The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,

620
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,000
except I do it for $11 an hour,
so they can bill 200.

621
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,400
That nail it for you, Sherlock?

622
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,100
That still doesn't explain why
we're walking out here...

623
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,400
- I don't know why the hell I'm out here!
- Yeah, I know...

624
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,700
Hey!

625
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,500
- Are you Jerry Shaw?
- Who are you?

626
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,000
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- I sent the package like she asked.

627
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,400
- Wait, what package?
- What is that?

628
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,800
- Now she wants me to drive you?
- Who, "she"?

629
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,300
- I won't. I'm done!
- You know "she"?

630
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
- Wait.
- Stay right there.

631
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,000
- Get back.
- Here. Here's the address.

632
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,000
- Why are you attack...
- Here. Here are the keys.

633
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,100
Take the goddamn van!

634
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,200
- You think I'm going to...
- Who's doing this?

635
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,900
...do this because I'm Iranian?
I am American. I'm finished! I'm done!

636
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,500
- What? What are you talking about?
- You take it!

637
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,400
- What are you talking about?
- I won't do this because I can't.

638
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,500
- Hello?
- <i>Stop him now, or he will die.</i>

639
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,200
Listen to me,
what are you talking about?

640
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,300
- You try to do this without me!
- How are you seeing us right now?

641
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,500
- <i>Stop him now.</i>
- What is she saying?

642
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,000
Stop. Hey! You gotta stop!

643
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,900
- Wait!
- You gotta stop!

644
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,300
- You killed that man.
- <i>Desertion is not an option.</i>

645
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,200
<i>Take the van.</i>
<i>Drive to Indianapolis, Indiana.</i>

646
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,100
<i>72 West 56th Street.</i>
<i>Arrive no later than 11:00 a.m.</i>

647
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,400
- Welcome.
- Hello. Agent Perez.

648
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,400
- To the right?
- Yes, ma'am.

649
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,300
- ID, ma'am.
- OSI.

650
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,000
I ordered a freeze on Ethan Shaw's
personal effects. What's going on?

651
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,800
Orders to sanitize came down
from the Two Star.

652
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,700
Okay, I'm countermanding.
Thank you. I'll take that.

653
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,000
- Tell your guys to clear out.
- Who are you?

654
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,700
This scene's part of
a federal investigation

655
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,800
with national security ramifications.
This your log?

656
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,500
- Yes, it is.
- Okay, my name is Agent Perez.

657
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,600
You can take this up
with your superiors.

658
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,800
- Clear the room!
- You guys move out.

659
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,000
No gloves?
Get statements from everybody.

660
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,400
- Yes, ma'am.
- And find out who this Two Star is.

661
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,400
I mean, come on, really!

662
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,600
Sir! We have a positive ID.

663
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,600
Okay.

664
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,500
The skin was pretty fried,
but we still managed to get

665
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,600
a partial print that matches
to a Ranim Khalid.

666
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:46,200
He's a United States citizen, registered
Republican, and he owns a music store.

667
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,800
- The guy's cleaner than lvory Snow.
- Got something here.

668
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,400
- That's a bone mic.
- Hello.

669
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,000
Military grade.
He didn't get that on eBay.

670
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,800
Someone was talking to him.

671
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,100
We have a cyber-terrorist here.

672
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,300
Someone's already inside
our computer systems,

673
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,200
hacking into the power grid,
traffic cams, automated cranes.

674
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,900
There's no way the boy
and the girl did this alone.

675
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,600
- Agent Zoe Perez?
- Yes.

676
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,600
United States Air Force
Security Forces. Please come with us.

677
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,700
- What's this about?
- Get in the car.

678
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,400
<i>Violence has broken out</i>
<i>in the Middle East as militants accuse</i>

679
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,700
<i>the United States</i>
<i>of launching American missiles</i>

680
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,000
<i>to demolish a village in Baluchistan,</i>
<i>killing innocent civilians.</i>

681
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,500
<i>The attack has triggered a</i>
<i>series of retaliatory suicide bombings</i>

00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,900
<i>against American embassies abroad.</i>

683

<i>Early reports indicate the American</i>
<i>death toll now stands at 56,</i>

684

<i>with threats of further violence</i>
<i>here at home.</i>

685
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,600
<i>Officials...</i>

686
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,300
What's he doing on a train, your kid?

687
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,700
He goes to a music magnet.

688
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,100
His school's on a tour of Washington.
They're playing at the Kennedy Center.

689
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,900
Wow. That's big. And you just...

690
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,400
Well, why'd you make that noise, "Huh"?

691
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,100
I can't make noises now?

692
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,600
- You think I should have gone.
- He's playing at the Kennedy Center.

693
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,100
- That's kind of a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

694
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,500
So I think maybe one parent
should have gone, that's all I'm saying.

695
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,200
Well, one parent had to work
while the other one does

696
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,100
everything humanly possible
to bail on child support.

697
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,000
But I don't expect you to know
a thing about responsibility.

698
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,600
You know, Rachel, you don't know
the first thing about me.

699
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,200
I know your brother just died,
and whatever he was into

700
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,500
- put my son's life at risk.
- I don't wanna talk about my brother.

701
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,100
- Okay? I'm not kidding.
- I'm not kidding, either.

702
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,100
Jesus, look what happened.

703
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,800
Can you honestly say he had
nothing to do with this?

704
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,800
I'm asking you not to talk about him!
Respect that.

705
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,800
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

706
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,400
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

707
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:11,500
Hey! You can't just walk away!
You can't just leave!

708
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,600
- Yes, I can.
- Now we have 15 minutes to get

709
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,500
- wherever the hell we're going, all right?
- Yeah.

710
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,200
I need you.

711
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,500
I could've gone.

712
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,800
I should have.

713
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,300
<i>You are two minutes behind schedule.</i>
<i>Go to the alley behind the building.</i>

714
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,100
- <i>Go to the armored truck.</i>
- I don't see an armored truck.

715
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,600
There it is.

716
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,000
<i>In 20 seconds, men will exit</i>
<i>the elevator. They will be armed.</i>

717
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,600
<i>One will be carrying a briefcase.</i>

718
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,900
<i>Retrieve it from him,</i>
<i>then return to the van.</i>

719
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,800
- This is insane. I'm not doing this.
- You want us to rob them?

720
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,400
<i>You now have 15 seconds.</i>

721
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,800
<i>Security. What's your emergency?</i>

722
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,400
What are you doing?
I'm not robbing them. Shit.

723
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,600
Put your gun on the floor.

724
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,800
Put your gun on the floor! Look straight.

725
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,800
You want me to blow his head off?
Put the gun on the ground!

726
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,600
We don't wanna hurt you guys.
Just drop the case.

727
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,000
Drop the case and kick it to her!

728
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,800
Yeah, well, you're bringing a shit storm
on your head.

729
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,900
Yeah, we're already in mid shit storm!
Now kick the case.

730
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,400
Okay! Easy.

731
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,800
- Look straight.
- Okay, done.

732
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,900
Kick it!

733
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,300
Okay.

734
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,000
- Don't even think about it!
- Back up.

735
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,200
Easy.

736
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,000
Back up.

737
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,900
Walk over here, stand next to him,
and turn around.

738
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,500
- Stand over here!
- Just take it easy.

739
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,600
Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!

740
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,600
Let's move, let's move!

741
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,700
Come on!

742
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,100
Jerry! Here!

743
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,000
Move, move!

744
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,000
Freeze! Police!

745
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,500
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

746
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,800
We're security! We just got robbed!

747
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,200
And there they are! We just got robbed!

748
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,200
Move! Get out of the way!

00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,800
Move!

750
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,200
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

751
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,200
Move!

752
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,400
- Hey, watch it, lady!
- Jerry, run!

753
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:54,900
This way!

754
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,700
- Out of the way!
- Come on!

755
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,400
- Move out of the way!
- Move!

756
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,500
You see that? This way.

757
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,800
- You are Jerry Shaw?
- Yeah.

758
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,300
Please come. Please.

759
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,900
- Thank you.
- Please come in.

760
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,900
Hi.

761
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,500
- Wait. What is that?
- It's a timer.

762
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,800
- For what?
- I don't know.

763
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,300
The only things I can think of
with timers are microwaves and...

764
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,000
And bombs.
You were gonna say bombs.

765
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,300
- Coffeemakers have timers.
- Yeah, Jerry, it's a coffeemaker.

766
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,700
That's great.

767
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,700
We've mobilized every asset
we can get our hands on.

768
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,600
So 12 more confirmed dead?

769
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,900
Yes, sir.

770
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,700
I want hourly sit reps
from General McKenna.

771
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,600
There's a military base
37 miles from that port.

772
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,000
Scramble whatever you can.

773
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,700
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me.

774
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,900
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you're thinking of taking me off

775
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,200
- the Shaw investigation, I'd...
- Taking you off?

776
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,300
Agent, for the first time
you're being brought onboard.

777
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,100
Back to bus 30 minutes. Okay?
30 minutes.

778
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,000
We're convinced a terrorist attack
on American soil is imminent.

779
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:14,200
Over the past two days, we've received
over 200 terrorist threats.

780
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,000
All starting the day
that Ethan Shaw died.

781
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:23,300
An accident. Or not.
You're gonna help us find out.

782
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,200
- Mr. Secretary.
- Gentlemen.

783
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,200
- I didn't think that there was a 36th floor.
- Glad we can still keep some secrets.

784
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,000
I want to know what's in the case.
Is it a bomb?

Well, that was quick. You done playing

Army, Navy, Air Force.

871
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,200
Every branch of the military had
a Minuteman posted here

01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,900
- to transport some sort of case.
- The chemical company?

899
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,100
Yes, exactly. Now, whatever was
in that case, Shaw now has.

900
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,700
They went right for the case.

901
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:41,400
Give us a minute, will you? We need
to know exactly what was in that case.

902
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,600
They never tell you what's in the case.
I mean, it could Bubonic Plague.

903
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,000
- Could be Grandpa's Viagra.
- You know anything?

904
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,500
- What?
- Anything at all?

905
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,300
- What about these guns?
- What about them?

906
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,800
It was a pump-action Remington 870.

907
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,900
Yeah, I know what kind of guns they are.
Get me a gun.

908
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,400
How were they holding them?
Get me a gun!

909
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,000
What the hell do you mean,
how were they holding them?

910
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,700
I mean, in what position
were they holding the gun?

911
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,200
- For instance, like this?
- Hey, hey, hey.

912
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,700
- Put that damned thing down!
- Or like in a music video,

913
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,000
- or something like that?
- Hey, hey, hey!

914
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,100
- Put it down!
- They weren't pros!

915
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,300
Okay, that's what I was asking you.

916
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,900
So they didn't know
how to handle a weapon.

917
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,100
- No.
- All right.

918
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,100
Get what you can
out of Batman and Robin here.

919
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,000
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

920
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,800
We just checked cameras.
They said Shaw fired at one...

921
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,700
Don't tell me.
Everything magically went black.

922
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,400
Hi, my name's Thomas Morgan.
I'm with the FBI.

923
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,400
- <i>Are your cameras on a network?</i>
- <i>No, man.</i>

924
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,300
- VCR's in the back.
- Well, I'm gonna need your tapes.

925
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,200
Shit.

926
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,200
Sam!

927
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,700
- Sam? Sam, where are you?
- <i>Hey, Mom, I got your message.</i>

928
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,200
<i>The train's awesome!</i>

929
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,000
- Sam, listen to me.
- <i>Brian tried to burp the alphabet,</i>

930
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,900
- <i>but he gagged when he got to "M."</i>
- Listen to me.

931
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,800
<i>Call you when I hit D.C. Bye, Mom.</i>

932
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,300
<i>Your son left that message</i>
<i>60 seconds ago.</i>

933
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,900
<i>You will see him again.</i>
<i>But there's something we require first.</i>

934
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,200
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

935
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:30,400
- No.
- <i>You will do it, or Sam will die.</i>

936
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,100
<i>You have six minutes</i>
<i>to return to the bus.</i>

937
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,500
- Ready?
- Here, you okay?

938
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:45,900
We should go.

939
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:53,900
Sir, we got something.
Play this screen right here.

940
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,000
Okay, freeze that. Now zoom in
on the front of the bus right there.

941
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,500
- Put it up on the other monitor.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,600
Now zoom in.
Zoom in on this point right here.

943
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,500
Can we zoom in tighter than that?

944
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,000
Okay, enhance that shot.

945
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,900
That's our guy, that's Jerry Shaw.

946
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,200
Zoom in right here on this spot.
Right there. The reflection.

947
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,900
All right. All right.

948
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,900
Right there. Hello, sweetheart.

949
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,100
Okay, so we got
a white brunette female,

950
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,500
mid to late 20s, approximately 5'9".

951
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,300
Find me that chartered bus!

952
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,100
Masako. M-A-S-A-K-O.
Sightseeing Tours.

953
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,200
What time did they get on?

954
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,100
I'm sorry for what I said about Ethan.

955
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,500
It's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.

956
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,100
And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.

957
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,700
And I was not that way.

958
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,700
I was the complete opposite.
I was the brother with lead shoes.

959
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,000
That was my role, I was good at it.

960
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,800
And he'd always try to help me.
You know, "This is how you throw it."

961
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:17,600
"Do it like this." "Write it like that."
"Put your foot here."

962
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:21,300
Even with the small things.
Homework, chores, anything like that,

963
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,100
he would handle it
and then say that I did it,

964
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:27,700
just so my father would notice me.
That was Ethan.

965
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,500
He never asked me for anything. Ever.

966
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:45,400
And whatever this is, he was part of it.
I feel like he needs my help to finish it.

967
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,300
I owe him that.

968
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:00,100
<i>We are now approaching</i>
<i>Dayton International Airport.</i>

969
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:05,400
<i>Please use caution as you exit the bus.</i>
<i>And don't forget any of your belongings.</i>

970
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,600
<i>Thank you.</i>

971
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:11,600
<i>Attention, passengers. Please do not</i>
<i>leave your luggage unattended.</i>

972
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,300
<i>Unattended luggage is subject</i>
<i>to collection and search</i>

973
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,800
<i>by the airport police.</i>
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

974
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,900
Yes, I'm walking toward them now. Yes.

975
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,700
Hey. These are from her.
Go to the ticketing machine.

976
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,400
Use the credit card to get your tickets.
Then walk to Gate 1-C.

977
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,200
They now have them.

978
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,300
That's a nice picture.

979
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,900
Okay. I need you guys at every exit,
watching faces.

980
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,800
Work the secure area first.

981
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,300
Go to the tower, have them order

982
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,900
a ground stop.
Don't change the departure boards.

983
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,800
We don't want them to know
we're coming.

984
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,800
Sir, can you please shut the cell phone
off? You cannot take it through.

985
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,900
- FBI. Clear the way.
- FBI. Please step back.

986
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,100
Please, there are others behind you.

987
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,100
- Keep it moving.
- Shoes and hats off, please!

988
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,300
- Shoes also, yes.
- Laptops should be out of their cases!

989
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,800
You need to make sure your jackets
are off and screened separately.

990
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,100
- Sir, step in the circle, please.
- Have boarding passes in hand, please!

991
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,600
We need to move this line quickly.

992
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,000
Sir, that needs to go through.

993
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,300
Ma'am, anything in your pockets?
Move it along.

994
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,800
Hats and shoes off, please!

995
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:45,000
- Laptops should be out of your bags!
- All right, next in line, please.

996
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,600
Have your tickets ready.

997
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,600
- Ma'am? Hat and shoes go in the bin.
- Step through.

998
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,900
Wait.

999
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:06,400
Shoes and hats off, please!
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1000
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,200
Go ahead.

1001
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,900
Please move to the back
and let the air crew go first.

1002
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,400
Step through, ma'am.
Boarding pass, please. Thank you.

1003
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,900
Have your tickets ready.

1004
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,700
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

1005
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:31,400
- All right, let's move forward. Next.
- She changed the screen.

1006
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,500
Lay it down flat inside the bin.

1007
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,400
- Please have boarding pass in hand!
- Right over here, ma'am.

1008
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,000
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1009
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,700
FBI! Out of the way!

1010
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,100
Out of the way, out of the way!
Move, move!

1011
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,300
Move!

1012
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,900
- Everybody, get down!
- Over here!

1013
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,100
- Move, move!
- Oh, my God!

1014
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,100
Stay down! Get out of the way!

1015
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:32,400
- Sir, sir, sir!
- Yes?

1016
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,000
I need your help. I'm sorry. Come here!

1017
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,900
Thank you.

1018
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,700
Hey, you aren't supposed to be in here!

1019
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,800
Go, go, go!

1020
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,100
Move!

1021
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,400
<i>Set the briefcase down.</i>

1022
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,800
<i>Open it.</i>

1023
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,100
<i>Load a vial into each syringe</i>
<i>and inject yourselves.</i>

1024
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,900
- What is it?
- <i>An experimental heart drug.</i>

1025
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,900
- <i>The cargo hold is unpressurized.</i>
- Take this.

1026
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,500
<i>The injections will lower your heart rate,</i>
<i>reducing your need for oxygen.</i>

1027
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,600
No.

1028
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,700
- Roll your sleeve up.
- No, I can't do this.

1029
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,900
Roll your...

1030
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,500
No! No, no, no, I can't.

1031
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,300
- We have to. Ready?
- <i>You have a 92% chance of survival.</i>

1032
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,700
- No.
- We have to.

1033
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,300
<i>Do it now, or you will suffocate.</i>

1034
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:27,900
Okay.

1035
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,900
<i>Get in the crate.</i>

1036
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,200
No. No.

1037
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,800
- No, no. Oh, God.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1038
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,500
Why is that plane on the runway?

1039
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,800
Shit, the military's cleared to
override a terminal lockdown.

1040
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,300
Okay, I want you to work with the FAA.

1041
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,900
I want to know what's in that plane
and where it's going.

1042
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,600
- Oh, my God.
- You'll be all right.

1043
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,600
Just talk to me.
We just gotta talk it through.

1044
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,900
- Okay.
- Just tell me anything.

1045
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:06,700
Anything you'd never rationally
tell a stranger.

1046
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,100
You're being sweet, but it's not working.

1047
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,400
Just tell me anything. Your ex-husband.

1048
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,900
- You didn't tell me about him.
- Okay, you're gonna distract me by

1049
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,400
bringing up the biggest mistake
of my life?

1050
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,800
It can't be the biggest mistake.
You got your child out of it.

1051
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,900
- You know? You got Sam out of it.
- Yeah, yeah,

1052
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,200
now you're gonna distract me
by bringing up

1053
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,400
- the one thing I'm most afraid of losing.
- Oh, God, you're hard to please.

1054
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,600
I'm sorry.

1055
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:31,300
Is your son handsome?
Yeah? What's he look like?

1056
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,500
- You got a picture?
- Yeah.

1057
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,200
Well, let me see.

1058
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,200
- There he is.
- The tooth grew in.

1059
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,500
- I hope so.
- It's an old picture.

1060
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:46,400
See? You're a good influence.

1061
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,800
He plays an instrument.
He's got a happy face. He's got teeth.

1062
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,400
You beat yourself up for no reason.

1063
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,500
Let's keep going.
What's the husband's name?

1064
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,500
- Ex.
- Ex-husband. What's his name?

1065
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,200
- Craig.
- Craig sounds like a shithead.

1066
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:03,900
He is a shithead.

1067
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:08,100
I mean, every year he forgets
his own son's birthday.

1068
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,500
Really? That sucks.

1069
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,200
I mean, after I kicked his ass out,

1070
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,000
I was so scared
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1071
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,100
And then this one night,

1072
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,900
I went into Sam's room,
he was, like, three months old,

1073
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,100
and there he was, just smiling at me.

1074
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,000
And that little face...

1075
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,900
And I was, like, I'm gonna do this.
I can do this.

1076
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,200
Whatever it takes.

1077
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,600
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna disappoint you.

1078
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,400
Aria, would you please bring up
the video log

1079
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,100
of the night Ethan Shaw died?

1080
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:19,500
<i>Sequencing video log 1137-Z.</i>
<i>Here you are, Major.</i>

1081
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,000
See that?
He's leaving three minutes early,

1082
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:25,000
and he's not even waiting
for logout confirmation.

1083
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,700
- Can you play that again?
- Sure.

1084
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,100
Did you see that?

1085
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,000
With his cell phone.

1086
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,200
Look, he's doing that on purpose.
Is that Morse code?

1087
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,100
- Yeah.
- Here.

1088
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,500
Why is he walking in circles
around the elevator?

1089
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,000
- <i>Initiating video shutdown for analysis.</i>
- No.

1090
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,900
No, Aria, wait.
Listen, I'm prioritizing this feed.

1091
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
- Stay with this.
- <i>Apologies, Major Bowman.</i>

1092
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,600
<i>Critical data sectors</i>
<i>have been corrupted.</i>

1093
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,700
Aria, this is important!
Stay with this feed!

1094
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,100
<i>Video sequence erased.</i>

1095
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,600
Aria, go to the backups!
Do not erase this!

1096
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,500
- It's a priority. You hear me?
- Bowman.

1097
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,400
- Loop it. Whatever you have to do.
- Bowman.

1098
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,700
It's the only place she can't see.

1099
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,400
This way.

1100
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,200
It's a memory card

1101
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,300
<i>from Ethan's cell phone.</i>

1102
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,300
<i>Aria, listen. You do not have</i>
<i>permission to exceed your authority</i>

1103
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,000
<i>and act independently.</i>
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1104
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,100
Let's go.

1105
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,800
We got clearance to land
at the Pentagon.

1106
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,200
Go ahead.

1107
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:46,700
I'm at the Pentagon.
Ethan Shaw wasn't an adversary.

1108
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,800
He wasn't even a Public Affairs officer.
He worked here, 36 floors underground.

1109
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,600
He was working for
the Secretary of Defense.

1110
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,300
- <i>The Secretary of Defense?</i>
- Yes.

1111
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,200
<i>On a project called Eagle Eye.</i>

1112
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,700
I just listened to a
message he left before he died.

1113
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,800
It's big.

1114
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,300
<i>I'm about to download...</i>

1115

Perez? Perez!

1116
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,900
Sir. Come with me.

1117
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,300
I have 10 minutes before
I'm sequestered

1118
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,700
for the State of the Union.

1119
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,300
<i>We really just need three minutes</i>

<i>Ethan Shaw investigation?</i>

1121
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,200

1122
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:51,000

<i>Sir, all the threats we've been tracking,</i>

1124
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,700
- the chatter, all of it...
- Hold it.

1125
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,700
Ethan Shaw left three minutes early
to leave us a recording.

1126
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,100
To warn us.

1127
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,600
<i>I'm ordering you to cease...</i>

<i>American citizens.</i>

1131

- <i>To prevent more bloodshed,</i>

1132
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,600

Sir,

1153
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,900
what abort recommendation
is Aria talking about?

1154
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,600
Three days ago, we thought we had
Majid al-Khoei and a training camp

1155
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,700
full of operatives.
But the intel was false.

1156
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,100
Aria tried to stop us.

1157
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,400
We got the wrong guy?

1158
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,600
I'm gonna need a full lockdown
on this level.

1159
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:29,800
No one gets in or out without
going through me first. You got it?

1160
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,600
- Thank you.
- Sir, this is the only item

1161
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:34,000
offloaded from the Dayton C-17.

1162
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,600
Let me see that.

1163
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,400
I need access to your 36th floor.

1164
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,200
- We don't have a 36th floor.
- Yes, you do.

1165
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:41,900
Get your commander
and tell him to meet us down there.

1166
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,900
Come on, let's go.

1167
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Router malfunction in hard drive 3.</i>

<i>Take the stairs</i>

<i>Rachel Holloman,</i>
<i>step away from Jerry Shaw.</i>

1174
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,800
What's Operation Guillotine?

1175
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,500
It's a simulation we run.
A terrorism drill.

1176
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,700
How to keep the government going

1177
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,800
in case the line of succession
were terminated.

1178
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,500
And Shaw put a biometric lock on her,
to stop her.

1179
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,600
Right. And he's dead.

1180
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:14,200
- So without Ethan Shaw, she's frozen.
- Right.

1181
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,300
Wrong.

1182
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,800
<i>Jerry Shaw, your next task.</i>

1183
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,700
<i>Approach the biometric scanner.</i>

1184
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,500
<i>Do not move.</i>

<i>Sir, I need to trigger</i>
<i>an emergency shutdown.</i>

1190
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,400
If this is right, we can't afford the risk.

1191
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,500
Do it.

1192
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,100
This is Secretary Callister.
There's been a malfunction in the vault.

1193
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,600
Open the door.

1194
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:19,200
- Can anyone hear me?

Come with me. Don't ask any questions.

Please.

1249
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,700
- You got to let me talk to him.
- The kid had a gun.

1250
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,700
The military has the ball now.

1251
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,200
- Sir!
- I'll get the Attorney General involved.

1252
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:25,100
Believe me, I will. 'Cause if it's not
you, I'm talking to somebody.

1253
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,700
You don't understand
the possibilities here.

1254
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,500
- What do you want?
- You need to listen. This is important.

1255
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,600
Sixteen hours ago, a commercial
explosive went missing from

1256
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:35,100
a testing site in Aberdeen.
The explosive is called Hex.

1257
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,700
It's a crystal that detonates
on a sonic trigger.

1258
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,100
- A crystal.
- Yes.

1259
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,400
We're only talking about a small
amount that's missing...

1260
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,000
Give me a ratio.

1261
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,800
One crystal to a football field.

1262
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:51,800
You couldn't have picked a worse time
to be of some goddamn use.

1263
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:01,600
Please, just tell me where we're going.

1264
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:07,600
I tracked the shipping on the trigger.
It was sent to the guy that we found

1265
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:10,200
underneath the wires. Ranim Khalid.

1266
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:14,100
- The music shop guy.
- Yes, exactly.

1267
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:17,500
I'm not gonna let us go down in history

1268
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,500
as the assholes who let
this thing happen.

1269
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,300
Open the door!
You don't know what's about to happen!

1270
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,300
Tom Morgan. The Attorney General

1271
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,900
has authorized me to take him
in for questioning.

1272
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,800
We're at threat level orange.
You guys gotta help me.

1273
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,700
All right. Let him out.

1274
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,800
Listen to me. Remember the voice
I was talking about?

1275
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,400
Yeah, yeah, shut up! Thanks, guys.

1276
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:44,900
I can get fired for this nine ways,
so button it or I'll turn us both in.

1277
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:02,500
Follow me.

1278
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:09,900
Hey, guys, here's one more for the
6:30 p.m. Capitol Limited.

1279
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,600
All right, man.

1280
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,300
Well, it's awfully cold outside.

1281
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,700
Here's mine. Come on, let's go.

1282
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,700
- Mr. Miller!
- Yes.

1283
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,600
- Hello, I'm Chris Carrick.
- Tom Donaldson.

1284
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
We're from the White House.

1285
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,700
- Something wrong?
- Not exactly.

1286
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,100
There's been a change of plans.

1287
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,600
How so?

1288
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,200
This is for you.
She wants you to change.

1289
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,600
Is that your family? Your parents?

1290
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:54,100
David, I bet you love them
as much as I love my son.

1291
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:56,800
His name's Sam.

1292
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,200
He's on a train.
Do you know anything about that?

1293
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,500
Maybe we can help each other.

1294
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,400
Please.

1295
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,200
When you're done, she wants you
to use the Capitol subway system.

1296
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:20,900
It's on the ground floor. I'm sorry.

1297
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,500
- David. Please.
- No. Sorry.

1298
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,500
You have three minutes.

1299
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:29,400
Okay, I want to know everything.

1300
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,900
The girl, the computer downstairs,
the Hex, everything.

1301
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,400
- What's Hex?
- The crystal explosive.

1302
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,800
- I don't know what that is.
- Don't bullshit me!

1303
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,400
- I don't know what that is!
- Start talking! I wanna know!

1304
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,400
I swear I don't know what you're
talking about! Listen to me!

1305
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:39,600
The computer's tracking us right now!

1306
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:40,700
Take this stuff
and throw it out the window!

1307
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,700
- What are you talking about?
- You need to take your cell phone,

1308
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:46,600
your pager, your walkie, anything that
gets a signal, throw it out the window.

1309
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:05,700
It's gone off! Get down!
Power it down!

1310
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:09,100
- What the hell's going on?
- System control's locked out.

1311
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:13,600
I need a vector and a fighter now.

1312
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:16,500
Viper One, we have a positive ID
on an MQ9 Reaper.

1313
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,900
<i>Snap vector 230 to 132.</i>

1314
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,400
<i>You are authorized to go weapons hot.</i>

1315
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,100
<i>Roger, Northcom.</i>
<i>I have a visual on the Reaper.</i>

1316
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,900
<i>One to Base, One to Base!</i>
<i>Ejection has been initiated.</i>

1317
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:33,200
<i>I don't have control! I don't have...</i>

1318
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,300
There's a target list.
President, Vice President.

1319
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,100
- There's like twelve people on the list.
- Jesus.

1320
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,600
The State of the Union's in 20 minutes.

1321
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,200
The screen said
"wireless detonator activated."

1322
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:42,600
- What about the girl?
- She kept the girl alive

1323
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:43,900
- for a reason, I don't know.
- The explosive

1324
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,400
is detonated by sonic trigger.

1325
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,900
It was sent to the guy who got fried.

1326
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
He owns an instrument store.

1327
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,600
Does any of that stuff
make any sense to you?

1328
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:51,900
Rachel's kid plays the trumpet.

1329
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,300
Come on, we gotta go.

1330
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,200
Get out of the car!

1331
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:13,700
Get out of the car!

1332
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,400
FBI!

1333
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,500
Over there, that tunnel.

1334
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:38,300
Shit!

1335
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:15,200
Here. You're gonna need this.

1336
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,300
Okay, listen to me.

1337
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,800
The Library of Congress,
there's a tunnel there.

1338
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:30,600
It'll get you to the Capitol.
Find the Sergeant at Arms.

1339
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,600
Tell him you have a POTUS 111.

1340
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,000
- What?
- POTUS 111.

1341
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:37,400
- It's a threat to the President.
- I understand. POTUS 111.

1342
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:45,200
Now get out of here.
That thing's coming back.

1343
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,100
Go! Go!

1344
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,600
Okay, watch your step.

1345
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:12,300
Come on down. Here we go.
Come on out. Come on.

1346
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,500
- It's so cool!
- Come on, hurry!

1347
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,600
Guys, it's so cool! Come on, let's go.

1348
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:31,300
- Library of Congress!
- Hey, get outta here!

1349
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,400
Miss Crowley?

1350
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,100
Miss Crowley. Welcome to the Capitol.

1351
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,400
Senator McDonnell's office said
that you'd be running late.

1352
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,200
- I'll take you to your seat.
- Thank you.

1353
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,800
Aria, why am I being spared?

1354
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:00,400
<i>Our abort recommendation was ignored,</i>

1355
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:03,300
<i>triggering violent retaliations against</i>
<i>American citizens</i>

1356
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:07,300
<i>with no predictable end.</i>
<i>Regime change is the only solution.</i>

1357
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,300
<i>You will lead</i>
<i>the new command structure</i>

1358
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,800
<i>as President of the United States.</i>

1359
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,600
- Help me. Pull these out.
- What are these?

1360
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:20,400
Her memory blocks.

1361
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,800
This will slow her down,
but her central operating system

1362
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:24,000
is up on the gantry.

1363
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:27,300
<i>Warning. Please replace</i>
<i>memory blocks A through F.</i>

1364
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:30,300
It's like her brain.
Protected by liquid nitrogen.

1365
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,500
We drain it and she'll fry.

1366
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:39,700
Hey, you can't go in!

1367
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,200
Tom Morgan, FBI. JTTF.

1368
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:43,400
I have a possible POTUS 111.
Let me in the building.

1369
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:46,500
Okay, everybody! Everybody!

1370
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,900
Can I have your attention, please?

1371
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,400
Saxophones, remember shorter
on those quarter notes.

1372
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,400
And when we get to the crescendo,

1373
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:59,300
"land of the free," hold that high F.

1374
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,800
And smile.

1375
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:04,500
Okay? It's not every day
you get to play for the President!

1376
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:26,600
Here we are.
And anything else, Miss Crowley?

1377
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,100
No, thanks.

1378
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,300
Madam Speaker,
the President's Cabinet!

1379
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:06,100
POTUS 111!
There's a bomb in the building!

1380
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,100
Stop! No entry! No exceptions!

1381
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:11,300
Tom Morgan, FBI. Back up.
Give me your cuffs.

1382
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:12,800
- Give me your cuffs!
- Take it easy!

1383
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:14,300
- Give me your cuffs.
- I'm reaching for them.

1384
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,200
I'm reaching for them.

1385
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:32,100
Madam Speaker,

1386
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:38,500
the President of the United States!

1387
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:50,900
<i>Data corruption at critical risk.</i>

1388
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,300
<i>You are now in violation of</i>
<i>national security protocol.</i>

1389
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:05,500
<i>Seeking available options.</i>

1390
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,800
<i>Uploading to offsite satellite.</i>

1391
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,800
- <i>Data upload: 3%.</i>
- Bowman?

1392
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:16,100
- What is she doing?
- She's trying to back up her memory

1393
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,300
and send it somewhere else!

1394
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:21,600
- <i>5%.</i>
- Bowman!

1395
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,400
Bowman!

1396
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,900
<i>8%.</i>

1397
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:39,000
<i>Over the past three days, 19 Americans</i>

1398
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,600
<i>have lost their lives to brutal</i>
<i>acts of terror...</i>

1399
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:44,600
- Tunnel secure.
- <i>... and hate.</i>

1400
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:50,200
But I say to you tonight
that our hearts may be broken,

1401
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:53,400
but our spirit will never be broken!

1402
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,000
<i>Data upload, 17%.</i>

1403
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,600
<i>19%.</i>

1404
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:11,800
<i>Perez, Zoe, you are now classified</i>
<i>as an enemy of the state.</i>

1405
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:14,800
<i>23%.</i>

1406
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:16,600
<i>25%.</i>

1407
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:32,100
<i>27%. Operation Guillotine is in effect.</i>

1408
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,600
<i>It was nearly 200 years ago,</i>

1409
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:38,600
<i>in the War of 1812,</i>
<i>that Francis Scott Key</i>

1410
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:43,400
found himself stuck on a truce ship
during the shelling of Fort McHenry.

1411
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,900
We lost some lives then, too.

1412
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:50,900
But our flag still flew high and proud.

1413
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,400
And his admiration became our anthem.

1414
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:56,400
With us tonight is the Youth Orchestra

1415
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,800
of the Barrow School
from Hyde Park, Illinois.

1416
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:01,200
Sam.

1417
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,800
Let us stand together,

1418
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:08,200
as they raise our spirits every inch
as high as that flag

1419
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:13,000
to show that our union
is still as strong as ever.

1420
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,900
<i>Oh, say can you see</i>

1421
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:39,400
<i>by the dawn's early light</i>

1422
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:43,900
<i>What so proudly we hailed</i>

1423
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,300
<i>at the twilight's last gleaming?</i>

1424
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:53,000
<i>Whose broad stripes and bright stars...</i>

1425
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,900
Sergeant at Arms?

1426
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:01,200
Hey. Hey.

1427
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,200
Get out, get out.

1428
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:54,100
Mom!

1429
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,900
Jerry, all right, you did it!
Come on. Yeah, Jerry!

1430
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,800
<i>There are still no named suspects</i>
<i>in the attack on the Blair Tunnel</i>

1431
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:27,800
<i>and the attacks in the Capitol Building.</i>

1432
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:30,800
<i>And there is still no word on the</i>
<i>involvement of Jerry Damon Shaw.</i>

1433
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:34,200
<i>... huge assassination attempt,</i>
<i>transportation networks disrupted,</i>

1434
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:37,000
<i>no suspects identified</i>
<i>or even arrested...</i>

<i>... any idea who is responsible</i>
<i>for what may be</i>

1436
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:41,500
<i>the largest-scale</i>
<i>cyber-terror attack that's</i>

1437
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,200
<i>ever been mounted in the United States.</i>

1438
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:45,300
<i>The House and Senate</i>
<i>Intelligence Committees</i>

1439

<i>meet in closed-door session</i>

1440
01:48:46,700 --> 01:48:48,700
<i>to discuss ways to prevent this kind of</i>

1441

<i>internal security breach</i>
<i>that left nearly...</i>

1442
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:53,600
The Aria project has been
decommissioned

1443
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:57,200
and all those involved
rotated to other assignments.

1444
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,900
Mr. Secretary,
we can't just stop intelligence-gathering

1445
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,400
just because of what happened here.

1446
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:07,200
No, we can't.

1447
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:10,100
All I know is we made
a great many mistakes.

1448
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,000
And good people
paid the ultimate price for them.

1449
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:17,300
<i>And that's a debt we can't ever repay.</i>

1450
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,400
<i>But we can honor it.</i>

1451
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:25,900
<i>And we can let their sacrifice remind us</i>

1452
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,900
<i>that sometimes</i>

1453
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,700
<i>the very measures we put into place</i>
<i>to safeguard our liberty</i>

1454
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:36,500
<i>become threats to liberty itself.</i>

1455
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:02,600
- Hey, little guy.
- Jerry!

1456
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:04,800
Look at you, looking older.
How are you?

1457
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:06,200
- Good.
- Happy birthday.

1458
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:07,800
It's Rock Band! Is that for me?

1459
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:10,300
No, this is so your
mom can practice her drumming.

1460
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,900
It is for you. Happy birthday.

1461
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,900
- Wow!
- Sam, what do you say?

1462
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,500
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

1463
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:17,500
Guys, look, it's Rock Band!

1464
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,500
- Cool, let's go.
- Awesome!

1465
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:28,500
- Sorry, I was late. I was...
- Thank you

1466
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,100
for remembering.

1467
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:32,500
Yeah.

1468
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,200
I'm glad you're here.

1469
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,200
Me, too.
