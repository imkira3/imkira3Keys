When your paths crossed in Bosnia...

475

...it was to appear
that you had stumbled upon him.

476

He was paid extremely well for what
was intended to be a wild-goose chase.

Then he murdered the boy.

That was not by design.

to control the Joker...

480
00:50:09,513 --> 00:50:12,971

Always with greater goals.

This was simply an unnecessary casualty.

As penance,
i chose not to make war with you again...

in Sarajevo.
