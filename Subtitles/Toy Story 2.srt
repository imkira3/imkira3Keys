Buzz Lightyear mission log.

3
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,267
All signs point to this planet
as the location of Zurg's fortress,

4
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:27,146
but there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

5
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,956
Come to me, my prey.

6
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,294
To infinity and beyond!

7
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,808
So, we meet again,
Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.

8
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,685
Not today, Zurg!

9
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,790
-No, no, no, no.
-Oh, you almost had him.

10
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,918
-I'm never gonna defeat Zurg!
-Sure, you will, Rex.

11
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,461
In fact, you're a better Buzz than I am.

12
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,129
But look at my little arms!

13
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:01,300
I can't press the "fire" button
and jump at the same time!

14
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,386
Where is it? Where is it?

15
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,347
Woody?

16
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,727
Hang on, cowboy!

17
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,818
-Woody, are you all right?
-Yeah.

18
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:22,655
Yeah, I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your
list of things to do while I'm gone.

19
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,031
Batteries need to be changed.

20
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,033
Toys in the bottom of the chest
need to be rotated.

21
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,494
Oh, and make sure everyone
attends Mr. Spell's seminar

22
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,538
on what to do
if you or a part of you is swallowed.

23
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,289
Okay? Okay. Good. Okay.

24
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,583
Woody, you haven't found
your hat yet, have you?

25
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,169
No! And Andy's leaving
for cowboy camp any minute,

26
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,504
and I can't find it anywhere!

27
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,589
Don't worry, Woody.
In just a few hours,

28
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:45,427
you'll be sitting around a campfire with
Andy making delicious, hot "sch'moes."

29
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,180
-They're called s'mores, Buzz.
-Right. Right. Of course.

30
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,349
Has anyone found Woody's hat yet?

31
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,103
Keep looking, men.
Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching.

32
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:59,191
The lawn gnome next door says it's not
in the yard, but he'll keep lookin'.

33
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,404
It's not in Molly's room.
We've looked everywhere.

34
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,364
-I found it.
-You found my hat?

35
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,659
Your hat? No.
The missus lost her earring.

36
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,454
-Oh, my little sweet potato!
-Oh, you found it!

37
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,832
Oh, it's so nice

38
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,460
to have a big, strong spud
around the house.

39
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,046
Oh, great. That's just great.

40
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,258
This'll be the first year I miss cowboy
camp, all because of my stupid hat!

41
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,594
-Woody, look under your boot.
-Don't be silly.

42
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:30,139
-My hat is not under my boot.
-Would you just look?

43
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,309
No hat. Just the word "Andy."

44
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,352
And the boy who wrote that

45
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,814
would take you to camp
with or without your hat.

46
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,567
I'm sorry, Bo.

47
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,445
It's just that I've been
lookin' forward to this all year.

48
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,697
It's my one time with just me and Andy.

49
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,782
You're cute when you care.

50
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,953
-Bo, not in front of Buzz.
-Let him look.

51
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,166
Miss Peep, your sheep!

52
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,253
This is Al from Al's Toy Barn,

53
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,796
-and I'm sittin' on good deals.
-Whoa!

54
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,549
I think I'm feeling
a deal hatching right now.

55
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:09,511
Whoa! Let's see what we got. We got
boats for a buck, Beanies for a buck...

56
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,097
-Turn it off! Someone's gonna hear!
-Which one is off?

57
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,308
Buck, buck, buck!
And that's cheap, cheap, cheap!

58
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,434
So hurry on down...

59
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,811
For cryin' out loud, it's this one.

60
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,815
-I despise that chicken.
-Fellas! Fellas!

61
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,069
Okay, I got some good news,
and I got some bad news.

62
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,737
What news?

63
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,073
The good news is
I found your hat, Woody.

64
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,743
My hat! Slink, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

65
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,537
-Where'd you find it?
-Well, that's the bad news.

66
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,958
Oh, it's Buster!

67
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,293
Canine alert! Man your battle stations!

68
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,879
Let's move, move, move!

69
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,548
Woody! Hide! Quick!

70
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,322
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay! You found me!

71
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,701
Buster, all right.
Hey, how did he do, Hamm?

72
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:17,413
-Looks like a new record.
-Okay, boy. Sit.

73
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,957
Reach for the sky.

74
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,834
Gotcha!

75
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,962
Great job, boy.

76
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,464
Who's gonna miss me
while I'm gone, huh?

77
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,549
Who's gonna miss me?

78
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,676
Who's gonna miss me?

79
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,344
Andy, you got all your stuff?

80
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,179
Have a good weekend, everybody.
I'll see you Sunday night.

81
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,056
It's in my room.

82
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,061
Stick 'em up.

83
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,189
I guess we'll work on that later.

84
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,400
Hey, Woody.
Ready to go to cowboy camp?

85
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,778
Andy, honey, come on.
Five minutes, and we're leavin'.

86
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,780
Five minutes.

87
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,284
Help, help! Somebody help me!

88
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,661
Let her go, evil Dr Pork Chop!

89
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,871
Never!

90
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,708
You must choose, Sheriff Woody.
How shall she die?

91
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,253
Shark, or death by monkeys?

92
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,964
Choose!

93
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,300
I choose Buzz Lightyear!

94
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,719
What? That's not a choice!

95
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,305
To infinity and beyond!

96
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,851
-I'll save you, Miss Peep.
-My hero.

97
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,438
-Thanks, Buzz.
-No problem, buddy.

98
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,482
You should never tangle
with the unstoppable duo

99
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,068
of Woody and Buzz Lightyear!

100
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,820
Oh, no.

101
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,574
Andy, let's go!
Molly's already in her car seat.

102
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,119
-But, Mom, Woody's arm ripped.
-Oh, no.

103
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,915
-Maybe we can fix him on the way.
-No, just leave him.

104
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,795
I'm sorry, honey,
but you know toys don't last forever.

105
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,851
-What happened?
-Woody's been shelved.

106
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,902
Andy!

107
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:33,757
-Woody?
-Woody? Honey, are you okay?

108
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,654
Yee-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy!

109
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,449
He's back?
Hey, everybody! Andy's back!

110
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,200
He's back early from cowboy camp!

111
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,828
Places, everybody! Andy's coming!

112
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,372
Yeah!

113
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,336
Hey, Woody! Did you miss me?

114
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,673
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap.
Ride 'em, cowboy!

115
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,094
I forgot. You're broken.

116
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,473
I don't wanna play with you any more.

117
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,204
No, Andy! No. No, Andy! No!

118
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,581
Andy. Andy.

119
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,293
Bye, Woody.

120
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,213
No! No! Andy!

121
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,312
Wheezy, is that you?

122
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,606
-Hey, Woody.
-What are you doing up here?

123
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,984
I thought Mom took you
to get your squeaker fixed months ago.

124
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,403
-Andy was so upset.
-Nah.

125
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,572
She just told him that
to calm him down

126
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,616
and then put me on the shelf.

127
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,994
-Why didn't you yell for help?
-Well, I tried squeakin'.

128
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,706
But I'm still broken.
No one could hear me.

129
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,754
Besides, the dust
aggravates my condition.

130
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,719
What's the point
in prolonging the inevitable?

131
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,848
We're all just one stitch away
from here to there.

132
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,061
Yard sale? Yard sale!

133
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:55,232
Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up!
There's a yard sale outside!

134
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,359
-Yard sale?
-Sarge, emergency roll call!

135
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,444
Sir, yes, sir! Red alert!

136
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,740
All civilians fall in position now!
Single file! Let's move, move, move!

137
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:04,825
-Hamm?
-Here.

138
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,285
-Potato Head, Mr. and Mrs.?
-Here.

139
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,203
Troikas. Check,
check, check, check, check.

140
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,747
I hate yard sales!

141
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,082
Someone's coming!

142
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,755
Okay. Let's see what's up here.

143
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,774
Bye, Woody.

144
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,117
Wheezy! Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

145
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,623
Hey. Here, boy. Here, Buster!

146
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:56,585
Up here! No, no, no, no, no, no!

147
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,588
Okay, boy. To the yard sale!

148
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,506
What's goin' on? He's nuts.

149
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,633
His arm ain't that bad.

150
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,260
Don't do it, Woody! We love you!

151
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,013
Careful on the steps, now.

152
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,365
Okay, boy. Let's go.
And keep it casual.

153
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,040
Not that casual.

154
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,545
Piggy bank coming through,
coming through.

155
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,048
-Is he out there?
-There he is.

156
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,018
He's getting in the box!

157
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,312
He's sellin' himself for 25 cents!

158
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,064
Woody, you're worth more than that.

159
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,483
Hold on. Hold on. He's got something.

160
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,193
-It's Wheezy!
-Wheezy?

161
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,405
Hey, it's not suicide. It's a rescue.

162
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,245
Good boy, Buster. Hold still.
There. There you go, pal.

163
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,872
-Bless you, Woody.
-All right, now.

164
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,582
Back to Andy's room.

165
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,210
Way to go, cowboy.

166
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,047
-Golly bob howdy!
-Woody, I'm slipping!

167
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,432
Mommy... Mommy, look! Look at this!

168
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,977
-Mommy, look! It's a cowboy dolly!
-Hey, that's not her toy!

169
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,937
What's that little gal think she's doin'?

170
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,773
Mommy, Mommy, can we get it?
Please? Mommy, please?

171
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,484
Oh, honey. You don't want
that toy. It's broken.

172
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,903
There's a snake in my boot.

173
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:54,953
Original hand-painted face.
Natural-dyed, blanket-stitched vest!

174
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:59,958
Little rip. Fixable. Oh, if only you had
your hand-stitched, polyvinyl...

175
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:04,296
A hat!
I found him! I found him! I found him!

176
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,091
Buster! Quiet down!

177
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,010
-Excuse me. Can I help you?
-Yes.

178
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,304
You can help take his paws off my pal.

179
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,973
I'll give you 50 cents for all this junk.

180
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,642
-Oh, now, how did this get down here?
-Hand her the sheriff.

181
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,311
Nice and easy.

182
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,189
-$5.
-I'm sorry. It's an old family toy.

183
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,816
Nowjust walk away.

184
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,276
-Wait.
-The other way.

185
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,154
-I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
-50 bucks ain't bad.

186
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,823
-It's not for sale.
-Everything's for sale.

187
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,534
-Or trade. You like my watch?
-Sorry.

188
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,246
-He's safe. Way to go Andy's mom!
-She showed him!

189
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,665
Molly, don't touch that, sweetie.

190
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,335
Yeah. Go home, Mr. Fancy Car.

191
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,004
-Hold on.
-What's up?

192
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,798
What is it, Buzz?

193
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,884
What's happening?

194
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,010
What's he doing?

195
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,763
I can't watch!
Can someone cover my eyes?

196
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,557
-He's stealin' Woody!
-What? He can't take Woody.

197
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:58,683
It's illegal.

198
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,519
-Where's he going?
-Do something.

199
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,853
Buzz!

200
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,273
Get him, Buzz.

201
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,568
Where's the red jacket?

202
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,689
Why would someone steal Woody?

203
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,439
All right.
Let's review this one more time.

204
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,941
At precisely 8:32-ish,

205
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:33,028
Exhibit A, Woody, was kidnapped.

206
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,531
Exhibit B,
a composite sketch of the kidnapper.

207
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,869
-He didn't have a beard like that.
-Fine. Etch, give him a shave.

208
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,705
The kidnapper was bigger than that.

209
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,292
-Oh, picky, picky, picky.
-Let's just go straight to Exhibit F.

210
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,627
The kidnapper's vehicle.

211
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,503
Now, the vehicle fled the scene
in this direction.

212
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,797
Your eyes are in backwards.
It went the other way.

213
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:53,924
Hey. Put a cork in it.

214
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,301
-How do you spell FBI?
-My crime scene!

215
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,470
Oh, why don't you watch
where you're going, Godspilla?

216
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,222
-I didn't know there was a crime scene.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

217
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,892
A little quiet, please. Thank you.

218
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,397
Lazy toy brain.

219
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,611
-Lousy try, Brian.
-What are you doing, Buzz?

220
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,656
It's some sort of message
encoded on that vehicle's I.D. tag.

221
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,991
-Liz try bran.
-It's just a licence plate.

222
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,785
-It's just a jumble of letters.
-Yeah, and there are about

223
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,956
3.5 million registered cars
in the tri-county area alone.

224
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,667
Lou's thigh burn.

225
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:32,545
Oh, this can't help.
Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys.

226
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,632
Toy. Toy. Toy. Hold on!

227
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,764
-Al's Toy Barn.
-Al's Toy Barn!

228
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,435
Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit.

229
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,190
It's the chicken man!

230
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,441
That's our guy.

231
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,611
I knew there was something
I didn't like about that chicken.

232
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,697
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there.

233
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,074
And we're gonna do this commercial
in one take, do you hear me,

234
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,077
because I am in the middle
of something really important.

235
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,872
You, my little cowboy friend,

236
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,584
are gonna make me
big buck, buck, bucks.

237
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:41,990
Andy!

238
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,913
I can't believe I have to drive
all the way to work on a Saturday.

239
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,041
All the way to work!

240
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,812
What? Whoa!

241
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,651
Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop! Stop! Sit, boy!

242
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,738
Stop it! Sit, I said!

243
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,240
Whoa! Whoa.

244
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,120
Yee-haw!

245
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:32,332
It's you! It's you!
It's you! It's you! It's you!

246
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,043
-It's really you!
-What's me?

247
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,422
There's a snake in my boot.

248
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,382
-It is you!
-Please stop saying that.

249
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,010
Prospector said someday you'd come.

250
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,970
Sweet mother ofAbraham Lincoln!

251
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,516
The Prospector! He'll wanna meet ya!

252
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,567
Say "hello" to the Prospector!

253
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,613
-It... It's a box.
-He's mint in the box.

254
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,573
Never been opened.

255
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,536
Turn me around, Bullseye,
so I can see.

256
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,542
Why, the prodigal son has returned.

257
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,377
Yee-haw!

258
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,670
It's you! It's you!

259
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,464
You're here! It's you! It's you! It's you!

260
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,967
Okay. I'm officially freaked-out now.

261
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:28,054
Oh, we've waited countless years
for this day.

262
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,683
-It's good to see you, Woody.
-Listen. I don't know...

263
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:36,604
-Hey, how do you know my name?
-Everyone knows your name, Wood-y.

264
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,610
Why, you don't know
who you are, do you? Bullseye?

265
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,919
That's me.

266
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,903
Wow.

267
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,117
Holy cow.

268
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,499
Cowboy Crunchies,

269
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,127
the cereal that's sugar-frosted
and dipped in chocolate,

270
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,629
proudly presents...

271
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:46,591
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

272
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,676
There's Jessie
the yodelling cowgirl

273
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,512
Look it! That's me!

274
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:55,975
-Bullseye, he's Woody's horse
-He's a smart one

275
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,727
Pete the old Prospector

276
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,187
Has anyone seen my pick?

277
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,690
And the man himself
Of course, it's time for Sheriff Woody

278
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,984
He's the very best

279
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,278
He's the rootin'-est
tootin'-est cowboy

280
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,739
In the wiId, wiId west

281
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,534
Woody's Roundup

282
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,207
I can't find it! It doesn't seem
to be on any of these stations.

283
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,959
-Keep looking.
-You're going too slow.

284
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,961
Let me take the wheel.

285
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,712
It's too fast.

286
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,715
-How can you even tell what's on?
-I can tell.

287
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,343
Stop! Back, back, back!

288
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,388
Too late. I'm in the 40s.
Got to go 'round the horn. It's faster.

289
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,600
-Back, back! Stop!
-And look for the giant chicken!

290
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,018
Now, Etch!

291
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,231
That's where I need to go.

292
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,775
You can't go, Buzz.
You'll never make it there.

293
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,152
Woody once risked his life to save me.

294
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:52,573
I couldn't call myself his friend
if I weren't willing to do the same.

295
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,367
So who's with me?

296
00:24:54,451 --> 00:25:00,123
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

297
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,794
This is for Woody when you find him.

298
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,798
All right,

299
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,342
but I don't think it'll mean
the same coming from me.

300
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:16,431
Mr. Buzz Lightyear,
you just gotta save my pal Woody.

301
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,517
I'll do my best, son.

302
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,603
Okay, fellas. Let's roll.

303
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,777
Geronimo!

304
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,198
You'd think with
all my video game experience,

305
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,617
I'd be feeling more prepared.

306
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,414
The idea is to let go.

307
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,709
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

308
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,046
Don't talk to any toy you don't know!

309
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,882
To Al's Toy Barn and beyond!

310
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,562
They don't call this

311
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,689
the old abandoned mine
for nothin', Prospector.

312
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,524
l reckon we oughta get outta here.

313
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,403
Where's my gold?
Hold on. l'll light me a candle.

314
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,280
This sure is a fast-burnin' wick.

315
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:17,283
Blast us to smithereens!
That there's dynamite!

316
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,827
-Holy tarnation.
-l'll call for help.

317
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,750
Hey, critters, go get Sheriff Woody.
Now scurry!

318
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,294
Good job, Bullseye.

319
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,422
l reckon the new schoolhouse
is finally done.

320
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,757
What's that?

321
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,759
Jessie and Prospector are trapped
in the oId abandoned mine,

322
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,136
and Prospectorjust lit a stick
of dynamite thinkin' it was a candle,

323
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:40,264
and now they're about
to be blown to smithereens?

324
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,850
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

325
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:50,775
You're fannin' the flames, Jessie!
lt takes brains to put out that fire.

326
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,611
My biscuits are burnin'!

327
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,660
Will Woody
and Bullseye land to safety?

328
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,121
Can they reach Jessie
and Stinky Pete in time?

329
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:07,500
Tune in next week for the exciting
conclusion, "Woody's Finest Hour."

330
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,044
All right! All right! Next tape!

331
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,964
Hey, wait.
What happened? What happens next?

332
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,842
-Come on! Let's see the next episode!
-That's it.

333
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:19,846
-What?
-The show was cancelled after that.

334
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:24,559
Wait. What about the gold mine and
the cute little critters and the dynamite?

335
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,437
That was a great show!
I mean, why cancel it?

336
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,939
Two words, Sput-nik.

337
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:34,902
Once the astronauts went up, children
only wanted to play with space toys.

338
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,489
I know how that feels.
But, still, my own show.

339
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,242
-I mean, look at all this stuff!
-Didn't you know?

340
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,619
Why, you're valuable property?!

341
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,789
I wish the guys could see this.
Hey-howdy-hey. That's me.

342
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,541
I'm on a yo-yo.

343
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,963
Oh, hey. Nice teeth.
And yet still a good-lookin' guy.

344
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,635
Oh, it's a bank! Cool.

345
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,930
What do you do?
You push the hat, and out...

346
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,350
Oh, out come bubbles. Clever.

347
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,895
Oh, wow. Hey, what's this thing do?

348
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,648
I get it.

349
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,734
"There's a snake in my boot."

350
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,361
Oh, hey, Bullseye. Go long! Go long!

351
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,950
A record player!

352
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,036
I haven't seen one of these in ages.

353
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,707
Okay, now. Slow.

354
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,044
Oh, that's funny, Bullseye.

355
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,630
Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast!

356
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,467
Not bad.

357
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,302
lt's time forWoody's Roundup

358
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,304
He's the very best

359
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,724
He's the rootin'-est
tootin'-est cowboy...

360
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,061
Look at us! We're a complete set!

361
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,189
-Now it's on to the museum.
-Museum?

362
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,069
-What museum?
-THE museum.

363
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,989
We're being sold
to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo.

364
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,283
-That's in Japan!
-Japan?

365
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:07,161
No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to Japan.

366
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,580
What do you mean?

367
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:13,292
I got to get back home to
my owner, Andy. Hey, look, look. See?

368
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,629
-He still has an owner.
-Oh, my goodness.

369
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,799
No. Can't go.

370
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,426
I can't do storage again. I just can't!

371
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,263
-Jessie. Jessie.
-I won't go back in the dark!

372
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,764
What's the matter?
What's wrong with her?

373
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,767
Well, we've been in storage
for a long time

374
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,269
waiting for you.

375
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,979
-Why me?
-The museum's

376
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:37,108
only interested in the collection
if you're in it, Woody.

377
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,860
Without you, we go back into storage.

378
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,989
-It's that simple.
-It's not fair!

379
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,657
How can you do this to us?

380
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,368
Hey, look. I'm sorry,
but this is all a big mistake.

381
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,580
-You see, I was in this yard sale...
-Yard sale?

382
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:53,040
Why were you in a yard sale
if you have an owner?

383
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,043
Well, I wasn't supposed to be there.
I was trying to save another toy when...

384
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,922
Was it because you're damaged?
Did this Andy break you?

385
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:03,634
Yeah, but... No, no, no, no, no!
It was... It was an accident.

386
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,554
-I mean...
-Sounds like he really loves you.

387
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,974
It's not like that, okay?
And I'm not going to any museum!

388
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,810
Well, I'm not going back into storage!

389
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,230
Al's coming!

390
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,441
Go! Go on, Jessie.

391
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,567
Jessie, look at me.

392
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,321
I promise you'll come out of the box.
Now go! Go!

393
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,912
It's show time!

394
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,125
Oh, money, baby.
Money, money, money.

395
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,170
And now

396
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,921
the main attraction.

397
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,227
No! His arm! Where's his arm?

398
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,939
No. No, no, no, no!

399
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,734
What am I gonna do? I know. I know.

400
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,446
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Pick up the phone!

401
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,947
-Hello?
-It's me. It's Al.

402
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,199
I got an emergency.

403
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,034
-l'm busy.
-Yes, we're all busy.

404
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,912
Look. It has to be tonight.

405
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,289
All right. All right.
But first thing in the morning.

406
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,167
It's gone! I can't believe it!

407
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,212
-My arm is completely gone!
-All right. Come here. Let me see that.

408
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,214
Oh, it's just a popped seam,

409
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,423
easily repaired.

410
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,550
-You should consider yourself lucky.
-Lucky?

411
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,762
Are you shrink-wrapped?
I am missing my arm!

412
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,347
Big deal.

413
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,560
Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy

414
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:40,314
is dying to play with
a one-armed cowboy doll.

415
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,276
Why, Jessie, you know he wouldn't last
an hour on the streets in his condition.

416
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:47,905
It's a dangerous world
out there for a toy.

417
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,472
All right.
Nobody look till I get my cork back in.

418
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,851
Good work, men. Two blocks down
and only 1 9 more to go.

419
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,144
-What?
-Nineteen?

420
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,771
Are we gonna do this all night?
My parts are killing me.

421
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:21,939
Come on, fellas.

422
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:25,359
Did Woody give up when Sid
had me strapped to a rocket?

423
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,111
-No.
-No.

424
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,072
And did he give up when you threw him
out of the back of that moving van?

425
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,366
-Oh, you had to bring that up.
-No, he didn't!

426
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:37,913
We have a friend in need, and we will
not rest until he's safe in Andy's room!

427
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,832
Now let's move out!

428
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,591
And that concludes
our broadcast day.

429
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,138
Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go.

430
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,682
Come on. You don't wanna
help me. I'm the bad guy.

431
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,353
You're gonna go back in storage
because of me, remember? Just go.

432
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,523
Bullseye... All right. All right.

433
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:49,193
But you have got
to keep quiet. Come on.

434
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,661
Over here. Attaboy.

435
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,205
Okay, Bullseye. Upsy-daisy.

436
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,972
Bullseye. Cut it out.

437
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,058
Stop it.
Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it.

438
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,351
Stop it.

439
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,426
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

440
00:34:57,012 --> 00:35:00,014
No, Officer! I swear. What?

441
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,442
Get in there.
There you go. Cheap case.

442
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,319
Where is the remote?

443
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,322
Where is the remote?

444
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:21,785
Why don't I put it in the same place
every... Oh, here it is.

445
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,132
What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry
I can't help you guys out.

446
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,177
Really, I am. But you didn't have
to go and pull a stunt like that.

447
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,137
What? You think I did that?

448
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,640
Oh, right, right.
The TVjust happened to turn on,

449
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,059
and the remote magically ended up
in front of you!

450
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,354
-You calling me a liar?
-Well, if the boot fits...

451
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,648
Say that again.

452
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,984
If the boot fits.

453
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,612
Okay, cowboy.

454
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:05,829
How do you like that?
Take it back! Take it back!

455
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,832
Don't think just 'cause you're a girl,
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

456
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,585
Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once.

457
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,757
I don't know
how that television turned on,

458
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,967
but fighting about it
isn't helping anything.

459
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:22,429
-If I had both my arms...
-The fact is, you don't, Woody,

460
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,848
so I suggest
you just wait until morning.

461
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:28,602
-The cleaner will come, fix your arm...
-And then I'm outta here!

462
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,649
Oh, no, no.
Bullseye, don't take it that way.

463
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,318
-It's just that Andy...
-Andy, Andy, Andy.

464
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,946
That's all he ever talks about.

465
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,541
Hey, Buzz, can we slow down?

466
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,461
May I remind you that some of us are
carrying over $6 in change?

467
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,548
Losing health units. Must rest.

468
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,383
Is everyone present and accounted for?

469
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,759
Not quite everyone.

470
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,970
-Who's behind?
-Mine.

471
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,311
Hey, guys.
Why do the toys cross the road?

472
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,356
-Not now, Hamm.
-Oh, I love riddles. Why?

473
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:18,152
To get to the chicken
on the other side!

474
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,155
The chicken!

475
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,287
-Oh, well. We tried.
-We'll have to cross.

476
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,413
What the...

477
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,248
You're not turning me
into a mashed potato.

478
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:35,627
I may not be a smart dog,
but I know what roadkill is.

479
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,338
There must be a safe way.

480
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,928
Okay.
Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go.

481
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,857
Drop!

482
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,280
Go!

483
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,327
Drop! I said "drop"!

484
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,830
Go!

485
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,839
Drop.

486
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,307
Go.

487
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,084
That went well.

488
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:07,135
Good job, troops.
We're that much closer to Woody.

489
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,016
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

490
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,727
Is the specimen ready for cleaning?

491
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,720
So, how long is this gonna take?

492
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,638
You can't rush art.

493
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,740
Oh, no. It's closed.

494
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,909
We're not preschool toys, Slinky.
We can read.

495
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,833
Hey, Joe, you're late.

496
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,917
We've got a ton of toys to unload.

497
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,378
All right. All right.
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

498
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,547
All right. Let's go.

499
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,883
But the sign says it's closed.

500
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,765
No, no, no, no. All together. Now!

501
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,455
Whoa, Nelly! How are we going
to find Woody in this place?

502
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,334
Look for Al. We find Al,
we find Woody. Now move out!

503
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,879
-Woody?
-Woody.

504
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,782
There you go.

505
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,454
He's for display only.

506
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,998
You handle him too much,
he's not gonna last.

507
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,209
It's amazing. You're a genius.
He's just like new.

508
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,000
It's amazing. You're a genius.
He's just like new.

509
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,816
Wow.

510
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,082
I could use one of those.

511
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:21,807
You know, they make it so you can't
defeat Zurg unless you buy this book.

512
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,809
It's extortion. That's what it is.

513
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:27,062
Hey, I always thought
the golden sector was the only...

514
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,356
I thought we could search in style.

515
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:34,528
Nice going there, Hamm. So how about
letting a toy with fingers drive?

516
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,207
Am I really that fat?

517
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,799
-What are you doing?
-You're in direct violation

518
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,134
of Code 6404.5,

519
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,804
stating all Space Rangers
are to be in hyper-sleep

520
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,681
until awakened
by authorised personnel.

521
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,807
Oh, no.

522
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,227
You're breakin' ranks, Ranger.

523
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,937
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

524
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:12,774
-I've got an AWOL Space Ranger.
-Tell me I wasn't this deluded.

525
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:16,069
No back talk!
I have a laser, and I will use it.

526
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,655
Mean the laser that's a light bulb?

527
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,868
Has your mind been melded?
You could've killed me, Space Ranger.

528
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,413
Or should I say "traitor"?

529
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,332
-I don't have time for this.
-Halt!

530
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,251
I order you to halt!

531
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,259
Listen to me. Listen. Wait.

532
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,389
-We've been down this aisle already.
-We've never been down this aisle.

533
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,558
-It's pink.
-Face it. We're lost.

534
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,727
Back it up. Back it up.

535
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,691
What a great party?!

536
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,738
How low can you go?
How low can you go?

537
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,824
Excuse me, ladies.

538
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,994
Does anyone know where we might
find the Al ofAl's Toy Barn?

539
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,454
I can help.

540
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,374
I'm Tour Guide Barbie.

541
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:14,544
Please keep your hands, arms
and accessories inside the car,

542
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,379
and no flash photography.

543
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,798
-Thank you.
-I'm a married spud.

544
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:22,636
-I'm a married spud.
-Then make room for the single fellas.

545
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,889
To our right is the Hot Wheels aisle.
Developed in 1 967,

546
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,433
the original series had 1 6 cars,
including the Corvette.

547
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,727
I beg your pardon, ma'am,
but where's Al's office?

548
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,855
Please hold all questions
until the end of the tour. Thank you.

549
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,399
It says how you defeat Zurg! Look!

550
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:39,235
-Excuse me, sir.
-Get this outta here, geekosaur.

551
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,488
-Look out!
-Stop, stop, stop!

552
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,664
Turn into the spin, Barbie!

553
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,917
My source of power!

554
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,921
No! Come back! Hey!

555
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,508
Wait up! Hey! Come on! Slow down!

556
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,719
Dinosaur overboard! Slow down!

557
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,263
Remain seated, please.

558
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,104
Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not really a Space Ranger.

559
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,856
You're a toy.
We're all toys. Do you hear me?

560
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,484
Well, that should hold you
till the court martial.

561
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:23,363
Let me go! You don't realise
what you're doing!

562
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,282
And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle.

563
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:31,496
In 1 995, shortsighted retailers did not
order enough dolls to meet demand.

564
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,623
-Hey, Buzz!
-Halt! Who goes there?

565
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,292
Quit clownin' around
and get in the car!

566
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,003
Buzz, Buzz, I know how to defeat Zurg!

567
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,132
-You do?
-Come on. I'll tell you on the way.

568
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:47,721
No, no, guys! You've got the wrong
Buzz! You've got the wrong Buzz!

569
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,973
Say, where'd you get
the cool belt, Buzz?

570
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,600
Well, slotted pig,
they're standard issue.

571
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,311
No!

572
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,074
It's like printing my own money.

573
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,660
Yeah? What?

574
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:14,914
Mr. Konishi.
Yes, I have the pictures right here.

575
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:19,669
In fact, I'm in the car right now on
my way to the office to fax them to you.

576
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,672
I'm going through a tunnel!
I'm breakin' up!

577
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,509
Oh, wow! Will you look at me?
It's like I'm fresh out of the box!

578
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:30,889
Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna
have a hard time rippin' this! Hello!

579
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,016
Hi! Hello!

580
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,185
Great. Now you can go.

581
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,482
Well, what a good idea.

582
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:53,036
Woody, don't be mad at Jessie.

583
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,371
She's been through
more than you know.

584
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,916
Why not make amends
before you leave, huh?

585
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,752
It's the least you can do.

586
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:12,096
All right.
But I don't know what good it'll do.

587
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,730
Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?

588
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:25,652
Thought I'd get one last look at the
sun before I get packed away again.

589
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,072
Look, Jessie.
I know you hate me for leaving,

590
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,491
but I have to go back.

591
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,576
I'm still Andy's toy.

592
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,038
Well, if you knew him,
you'd understand. Andy's a real...

593
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:40,917
Let me guess.
Andy's a real special kid.

594
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,461
And to him, you're his buddy,
his best friend.

595
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:48,925
And when Andy plays with you,
it's like even though you're not moving,

596
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:53,012
you feel like you're alive,
because that's how he sees you.

597
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:55,598
How did you know that?

598
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,643
Because Emily was just the same.

599
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,187
She was my whole world.

600
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,777
When somebody loved me

601
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:11,281
Everything was beautiful

602
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,951
Every hour we spent together

603
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,037
Lives within my heart

604
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,166
And when she was sad

605
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:25,962
l was there to dry her tears

606
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:31,301
And when she was happy, so was l

607
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:36,723
When she loved me

608
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,104
Through the Summer and the Fall

609
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:47,442
We had each other
That was all

610
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,653
Just she and l together

611
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:54,574
Like it was meant to be

612
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,745
And when she was lonely

613
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,165
l was there to comfort her

614
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,627
And l knew that

615
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:11,007
She loved me

616
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,309
So the years went by

617
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,020
l stayed the same

618
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,857
But she began to drift away

619
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:31,986
l was left alone

620
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:35,448
Still l waited for the day

621
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,617
When she'd say

622
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:44,624
l will always love you

623
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:50,213
Lonely and forgotten

624
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,883
l never thought she'd look my way

625
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:57,345
She smiled at me and held me

626
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:01,432
Just like she used to do

627
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:05,353
Like she loved me

628
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:09,273
When she loved me

629
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,404
When somebody loved me

630
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:18,449
Everything was beautiful

631
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:22,203
Every hour we spent together

632
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:26,082
Lives within my heart

633
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:33,006
When she loved me

634
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:50,815
You never forget kids
like Emily or Andy.

635
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,903
But they forget you.

636
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:59,198
-Jessie, I didn't know.
-Just go.

637
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,515
How long will it last, Woody?
Do you really think

638
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,436
Andy is gonna take you to college
or on his honeymoon?

639
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:35,234
Andy's growing up,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

640
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,905
It's your choice, Woody.

641
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:43,117
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

642
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:48,623
You'll be adored
by children for generations.

643
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:08,017
Who am I to break up
the Roundup gang?

644
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:27,370
-Hey, Woody, are you in here?
-Nah. This one's empty too.

645
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,331
-Woody! Woody!
-Woody!

646
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,415
Pardon me, gentlemen,

647
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,918
but have either of you seen
a cowboy doll with a bad arm?

648
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,337
-Why, no, I haven't.
-Hey! He was talkin' to me!

649
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:39,132
-No! He was talkin' to me!
-Why, you...

650
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,509
You see, all along,

651
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,220
we thought the way into Zurg's fortress
was through the main gate,

652
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:49,308
but in fact the secret entrance is
to the left, hidden in the shadows.

653
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,978
To the left in the shadows. Got it.

654
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,857
-Someone's coming.
-Everyone, take cover.

655
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,401
It was a big pile-up, but I don't want
to bore you with the details.

656
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,903
Yes. Now, let me confirm
your fax number.

657
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,071
-01 1 ...
-01 1 . Wait.

658
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:04,073
That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it.

659
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,783
-It's him.
-The chicken man.

660
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,577
Funny, he doesn't look like poultry.

661
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,912
That's the kidnapper, all right.

662
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:13,666
A kidnapper!
An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one.

663
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,760
And the piéce de résistance!

664
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:28,139
I promise the collection will be
the crown jewel of your museum.

665
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,308
-It's Woody!
-Now that I have your attention,

666
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,644
imagine we added
another zero to the price, huh?

667
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:38,191
-l'll pay anything you want.
-Yes! Yes!

668
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,444
You got a deal!
I'll be on the next flight to Japan!

669
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,112
Quick.
Into the poultry man's cargo unit.

670
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:46,032
He'll lead us to Zurg.
Move, move, move!

671
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,535
Don't touch my moustache!

672
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,501
Rich, rich, rich, rich!

673
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,997
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

674
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,625
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

675
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,967
-He didn't take the bag!
-No time to lose!

676
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,186
He's ascending
in the vertical transporter.

677
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,440
All right, everyone. Hang on.
We're gonna blast through the roof.

678
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:46,402
-Buzz?
-To infinity and beyond!

679
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:53,159
What are you? Insane? We're
wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla.

680
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,245
I don't understand.

681
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,998
Somehow my fuel cells have gone dry.

682
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,559
Blast. He's on level 23.

683
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,603
How are we gonna get up there?

684
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,522
Maybe if we find some balloons,
we could float to the top.

685
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,108
Are you kidding?
I say we stack ourselves up,

686
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,694
push the intercom
and pretend we're delivering a pizza.

687
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:32,073
How about a ham sandwich
with fries and a hot dog?

688
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,115
What about me?

689
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,117
You can be the toy
that comes with the meal.

690
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,203
Troops! Over here.

691
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,794
Just like you said, lizard man.
"In the shadows to the left."

692
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,670
Okay. Let's move!

693
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,634
Mission log. Have infiltrated
enemy territory without detection

694
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,637
and are making our way
through the bowels of Zurg's fortress.

695
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,015
You know, I think that Buzz aisle
went to his head.

696
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:01,310
Oh, no. Which way do we go?

697
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,479
-This way!
-What makes you so sure?

698
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,232
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.

699
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:10,111
We've been detected. The walls!
They're closing in! Quick!

700
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,321
Help me prop up vegetable man,
or we're done for.

701
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,031
Hey! Put me down, you moron!

702
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:17,660
Guys, look! It's not the walls!
It's the elevator!

703
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:28,254
Come on. We've got no time to lose.
Everyone, grab hold!

704
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,505
What?

705
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:33,384
Buzz, why not just take the elevator?

706
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,594
They'll be expecting that.

707
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,777
Hey, Buzz! Stop!

708
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,362
Slow down!

709
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:58,367
To overnight six packages
to Japan is how much?

710
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,578
That's in yen, right?

711
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,956
Dollars?
You are deliberately taking advantage

712
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,083
of people in a hurry, you know that?

713
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:09,128
All right. I'll do it! All right. Fine.

714
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,339
I'll have the stuff in the lobby,
and you'd better be here in 1 5 minutes,

715
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:15,342
because I have a plane
to catch, do you hear me?

716
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,973
We're finally going.
Can you believe it?

717
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,184
That's custom-fitted

718
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,186
foam insulation
you'll be riding in, Bullseye.

719
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,438
First class all the way!

720
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:31,066
You know what?
I'm actually excited about this.

721
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,943
I mean it. I really am!

722
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:35,738
-And why shouldn't you be?
-Yee-haw!

723
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,073
Swing your partner do-si-do

724
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:42,578
-Look at you, dancing cowboy!
-Look! I'm doin' the box step!

725
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,174
Hey, heads up down there!

726
00:59:55,258 --> 01:00:00,179
-Whoa! Pork bellies are fallin'.
-Hey, how much farther, Buzz?

727
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,973
Halfway there.

728
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:06,644
My arms can't hold on much longer!

729
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,150
Too heavy.

730
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:14,777
What was I thinking?

731
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,820
My antigravity servos!

732
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:21,700
Hang tight, everyone.
I'm going to let go of the wall.

733
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,160
-What?
-He wouldn't.

734
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:24,954
-One...
-He would.

735
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,372
Two...

736
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,666
Three!

737
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:35,714
To infinity and beyond!

738
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,719
Approaching destination.
Reengaging gravity.

739
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,146
Area secure.

740
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,107
It's okay, troops.

741
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:57,611
The antigravity sickness will wear off
momentarily. Now let's move!

742
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:01,574
Remind me to glue his helmet shut
when we get back.

743
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,710
How 'bout givin' me
a little intro there, Jessie?

744
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:16,422
Introducing the high-ridin'-est
cowboy around...

745
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,465
You forgot "rootin'-tootin'-est"!

746
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:22,511
The high-ridin'-est, rootin'-tootin'-est
cowboy hero of all time,

747
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,638
Sheriff Woody!

748
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,276
Say, little missy, you notice
any trouble around these parts?

749
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,070
Nary a bit,
not with Sheriff Woody around.

750
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,072
Wait, wait, wait! I got it!
This is great! Okay!

751
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:44,867
The bandits got the critters tied up
in the burning barn. Now the best part!

752
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,910
Help us! The barn's on fire!

753
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:49,246
I've got ya, critters. No need to worry.

754
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:51,707
Woody saves the day again!

755
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,916
Yee-haw!

756
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:54,960
Now, where's my trusty steed Bullseye?

757
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:57,588
I have to ride off into the sunset...

758
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,965
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

759
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,057
Watch it. Wait. I'm ticklish, okay?

760
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,725
Oh, you are?

761
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,061
No, no, no. Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it.

762
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,979
No, please. No, no. Stop! Stop!

763
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,408
Mission log. Have reached
Zurg's command deck,

764
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:29,119
but no sign of him
or his wooden captive.

765
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:31,830
-Please, no!
-That's Woody!

766
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,249
This way!

767
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:39,171
Please, please, no!

768
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,757
Buzz, can you see? What's going on?

769
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,636
-Take that!
-To the left.

770
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,096
No, your left.

771
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,431
-Take it up higher.
-What's happening?

772
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,935
Oh, it's horrible.
They... They're torturing him.

773
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,437
-What are we gonna do, Buzz?
-Use your head!

774
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,482
But I don't wanna use my head!

775
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:05,447
What's going on here?

776
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,700
Buzz, guys!
Hey, how did you find me?

777
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,867
Watch yourself!

778
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,661
We're here to spring ya, Woody!

779
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:12,621
You heard of kung fu?

780
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,748
Well, get ready for pork chop.

781
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:18,001
Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes!

782
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,714
Hold it, now!
Hey, you don't understand!

783
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:22,798
These are my friends!

784
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:26,051
-Yeah, we're his friends!
-No, Rex, I mean they're my friends!

785
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,302
Hey, stop it!

786
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:30,264
Leave him alone, springy dog! Hey!

787
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,851
-Grab Woody, and let's go!
-Fellas, hold it! Buzz, put me down!

788
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,186
-Quick! To the vent!
-They're stealing him.

789
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,438
No!

790
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:39,898
Hold it right there!

791
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,650
-Buzz?
-You again?

792
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:44,653
-Thank goodness you're all right.
-Buzz, what is going on?

793
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:48,323
Hold on. I am Buzz Lightyear,
and I'm in charge of this detachment.

794
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:49,825
No, I'm Buzz Lightyear.

795
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,535
-I'm Buzz Lightyear!
-I'm Buzz Lightyear!

796
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:53,495
So, who's the real Buzz?

797
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,081
-I am!
-Don't let this impostor fool you!

798
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,793
He's been trained by Zurg himself
to mimic my every move.

799
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:07,384
Buzz!

800
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:09,094
I had a feelin' it was you.

801
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:12,514
My front end just had
to catch up with my back end.

802
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,392
Will somebody please
explain what's going on?

803
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:18,562
It's all right, Space Ranger.
It's a code 546.

804
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:21,273
-You mean it's a...
-Yes.

805
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,442
-And he's a...
-Oh, yeah.

806
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,987
Your Majesty.

807
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,948
Woody, you're in danger here.
We need to leave now.

808
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,867
Al's selling you to a toy museum

809
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,786
-in Japan!
-I know.

810
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,955
It's okay, Buzz. I actually wanna go.

811
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,457
-What?
-Are you crazy?

812
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:41,627
Look, the thing is,
I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll,

813
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,879
and these guys are my Roundup gang.

814
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:47,424
-What are you talking about?
-Woody's Roundup!

815
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:51,345
Oh, it's this great old TV show,
and I was the star. See? Now look.

816
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,972
Look! Look at me! See? That's me!

817
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,392
-This is weirdin' me out.
-Buzz, it was a national phenomenon.

818
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,228
There was all this merchandise
that got packed up.

819
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,354
You should have seen it.

820
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:03,732
There was a record player and a yo-yo.
Buzz, I was a yo-yo!

821
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:06,652
-"Was"?
-Stop this nonsense and let's go.

822
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,153
Nah, Buzz.

823
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:13,492
I can't go. I can't abandon these guys.

824
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,119
They need me to get into this museum.

825
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:19,998
Without me, they'll go back
into storage. Maybe forever!

826
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:23,710
Woody, you're not a collector's item.
You're a child's plaything.

827
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:26,255
You are a toy!

828
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,925
For how much longer? One more rip,
and Andy's done with me.

829
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,803
And what do I do then, Buzz?
You tell me.

830
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,764
Somewhere in that pad of stuffing
is a toy who taught me

831
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:39,518
that life's only worth living
if you're bein' loved by a kid.

832
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,563
And I travelled all this way
to rescue that toy

833
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,606
because I believed him.

834
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:48,151
Well, you wasted your time.

835
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,201
-Let's go, everyone.
-What about Woody?

836
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:59,496
He's not coming with us.

837
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:04,042
But... But Andy's coming home tonight.

838
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:07,713
Then we'd better make sure
we're there waiting for him.

839
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:20,475
I don't have a choice, Buzz.
This is my only chance.

840
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,977
To do what, Woody?

841
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:25,397
Watch kids from behind glass
and never be loved again?

842
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,274
Some life.

843
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:34,197
-ls everybody okay?
-Sheriff Woody!

844
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:37,910
-l knew you'd make it!
-Now, remember, deputies,

845
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,704
the real treasures are
your friends and family.

846
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:44,291
Before l go, kids, l want to share
somethin' special with you,

847
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,419
-for the times l'm not around.
-Good going, Woody!

848
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,004
I thought they'd never leave.

849
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,882
You've got a friend in me

850
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,384
You've got a friend in me

851
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,011
Woody?

852
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,137
You've got troubles

853
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,140
Well, l've got 'em too

854
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:04,186
There isn't anything
l wouldn't do for you

855
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,272
We stick together
and see it through

856
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,776
'Cause you've got a friend in me

857
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:16,698
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than l am

858
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:20,702
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe

859
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:24,373
But none of them will ever love you

860
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:29,127
The way l do
lt's me and you, boy

861
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:31,797
And as the years go by

862
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:36,051
Our friendship will never die

863
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,637
You're gonna see it's our destiny

864
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,305
What am I doing?

865
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,101
-Buzz! Wait! Wait!
-Woody, where are you going?

866
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:47,396
You're right, Prospector.
I can't stop Andy from growing up.

867
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,731
But I wouldn't miss it for the world.

868
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:52,567
-No!
-Buzz!

869
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:53,652
-Yes?
-Yes?

870
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,654
I'm coming with you!

871
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,699
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll be back in just a second.

872
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,158
Way to go, cowboy!

873
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:04,121
-Hey, you guys... Come with me.
-What?

874
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,581
Andy will play with all of us. I know it!

875
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,583
Woody, I don't know. I...

876
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:12,337
Wouldn't you give anything
just to have one more day with Emily?

877
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:16,925
Come on, Jessie. This is what
it's all about, to make a child happy.

878
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:20,178
And you know it.
Bullseye, are you with me?

879
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,764
Okay, good boy.

880
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,017
Prospector, how 'bout you?

881
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,773
-Prospector?
-You're outta your box!

882
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,152
I tried reasoning with you, Woody,

883
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:38,864
but you keep forcing me
to take extreme measures.

884
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,702
Wait a minute. You turned on the TV
last night, not Jessie.

885
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:47,539
Look, we have an eternity
to spend together in the museum.

886
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,625
Let's not start off
by pointing fingers, shall we?

887
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,753
You really are Stinky Pete, aren't you?

888
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,463
Prospector, this isn't fair.

889
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,632
"Fair"? I'll tell you what's not fair.

890
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:03,472
Spending a lifetime on a dime-store
shelf watching every other toy be sold.

891
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,474
Well, finally my waiting has paid off,

892
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:10,062
and no hand-me-down cowboy doll
is gonna mess it up for me now!

893
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:15,150
Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys!

894
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:19,362
It's too late, Woody. That silly
Buzz Lightweight can't help you.

895
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,323
His name is Buzz Lightyear.

896
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:25,202
Whatever. I've always hated
those upstart space toys.

897
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,288
It's stuck! What do we do?

898
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:29,873
Should I use my head?

899
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:33,418
It's Al!

900
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,631
Look at the time. I'm gonna be late!

901
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:40,175
Figures. I can't miss this flight!
I've gotta pack.

902
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,136
All right. Let's see.
Wallet, keys, tickets,

903
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:45,388
passport, beefjerky,
very expensive over there.

904
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,557
Shower! Oh, I can skip the shower.

905
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:50,185
I just gotta get outta here now!

906
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,481
Quick! To the elevator!

907
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,739
Hurry. I can hear it coming.

908
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:09,955
So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear,

909
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,623
for the last time.

910
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:15,627
It's Zurg! Watch out!
He's got an ion blaster!

911
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:31,226
Quick! Get on!

912
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,566
The emergency hatch! Come on!

913
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,381
-Come on! Hurry!
-But Buzz is in peril!

914
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:04,217
Buzz Buzz Buzz...

915
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:18,231
Surrender, Buzz Lightyear. I have won.

916
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:21,276
I'll never give in. You killed my father!

917
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,238
No, Buzz. I AM your father.

918
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:29,034
No!

919
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,871
Come on! Come on! Come on!

920
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,794
Buzz, you could have
defeated Zurg all along!

921
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:42,964
You just need to believe in yourself!

922
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:46,218
-Prepare to die!
-I can't look!

923
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,346
Whoa!

924
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:57,896
I did it. I finally defeated Zurg!

925
01:11:58,731 --> 01:11:59,981
Father.

926
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:09,908
Finally!

927
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,102
How are we gonna get him now?

928
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,770
Pizza, anyone?

929
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:42,023
-Go, go, go!
-I got it!

930
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:43,191
Buzz, are you coming?

931
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:46,778
No, I have a lot of
catching up to do with my dad.

932
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:52,492
Good throw, son.
That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy!

933
01:12:52,576 --> 01:12:55,578
-Oh, you're a great dad.
-Farewell.

934
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,206
Does anyone know how to drive?

935
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,667
Slink, take the pedals.
Rex, you navigate.

936
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,503
Hamm and Potato,
operate the levers and knobs.

937
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,505
Whoa.

938
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,093
-Strangers.
-From the outside.

939
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:13,054
-Oh, no.
-He's at a red light! We can catch him!

940
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,015
Maximum power, Slink!

941
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,227
It turned green! Hurry!

942
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:22,022
-Why won't it go?
-Use the Wand of Power.

943
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:32,574
-Rex, which way?
-Left! No, no! I mean right!

944
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,577
That's right! No, I mean left!
Left is right!

945
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,538
Buzz, he's turning left! He's turning left!

946
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:42,667
Oh, boy!

947
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:44,919
Whoa!

948
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,589
Oh, I seriously doubt
he's gettin' this kind of mileage.

949
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,258
Go right! To the right!
Right, right, right, right!

950
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,178
Whoa!

951
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:57,265
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

952
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

953
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:11,071
The white zone is
for immediate loading and unloading...

954
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:14,032
No parking.

955
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,120
Guys, we can't park here!
It's a white zone!

956
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:22,624
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

957
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,167
-Final boarding call...
-There he is!

958
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:26,628
...for Far East Airlines
flight 451 to Tokyo.

959
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,838
All confirmed passengers
with boarding passes

960
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,965
must board at this time.

961
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:36,012
Passenger Twitch, passenger
Leon Twitch, please pick up...

962
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:38,765
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

963
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:41,643
-Will you leave me alone?
-Someone's coming!

964
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,312
-A puppy!
-Bark, bark, bark, bark.

965
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:45,730
Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

966
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:47,857
Listen, flyboy.

967
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:50,860
The contents of that case are
worth more than you make in a year!

968
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:53,321
-You got that, sport? You be careful!
-I understand, sir.

969
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:56,157
Do you have a "fragile" sticker
or something?

970
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,034
I had a box of cookies once
that came back as crumbs!

971
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,454
The Mystic Portal!

972
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:05,417
Once we go through,
we just need to find that case.

973
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:23,351
-There's the case!
-No, there's the case!

974
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:27,105
You take that one! We'll take this one!

975
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,702
Whoa! Buzz!

976
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,621
Buzz, my back end's
goin' to Baton Rouge!

977
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,457
Slinky!

978
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:50,462
Here we come, Woody!
Woody, here we come! Woody!

979
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:52,922
Nice flash, though.

980
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,396
Okay, Woody, let's go!

981
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,357
Take that, space toy.

982
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:14,110
Hey! No one does that to my friend!

983
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:22,911
Your choice, Woody.

984
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,413
You can go to Japan together
or in pieces.

985
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:29,167
If he fixed ya once,
he can fix ya again. Now get in the box!

986
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,336
-Never!
-Fine!

987
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:39,677
-No!
-Gotcha!

988
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:42,305
Idiots! Children destroy toys!

989
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,599
You'll all be ruined, forgotten!

990
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:47,685
Spending eternity
rotting in some landfill!

991
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:52,941
Well, Stinky Pete, I think it's time you
learned the true meaning of playtime.

992
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:57,111
-Right over there, guys!
-No. No! No!

993
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:01,950
Atlantic Air flight 810
from Point Richmond

994
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,619
is now arriving at Gate 3.

995
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:07,872
Look, Barbie. A big, ugly man doll.

996
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:10,291
He needs a makeover.

997
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,712
Hi! You'll like Amy.

998
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:17,799
She's an artist!

999
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,553
Come on, hon!

1000
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:26,057
Happy trails, Prospector.

1001
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:27,892
-Buzz! Woody!
-Help us out here!

1002
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,103
Hurry!

1003
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:33,606
-Oh, no. Jessie! Come on!
-Oh, Woody!

1004
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:44,075
Jessie!

1005
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,412
Come on, Buzz.

1006
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:49,998
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

1007
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:01,926
Hey-howdy-hey! Giddyap!

1008
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:04,220
Come on, Bullseye!

1009
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,683
Buzz, give me a boost!

1010
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,611
Woody!

1011
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,729
Here's the rest!

1012
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:18,961
Excuse me, ma'am, but I believe
you're on the wrong flight.

1013
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:20,880
-Woody!
-Come on, Jess.

1014
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,840
-It's time to take you home.
-But

1015
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,051
-what ifAndy doesn't like me?
-Nonsense!

1016
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,178
Andy'll love you! Besides,

1017
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,514
-he's got a little sister.
-He does?

1018
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:32,100
-Why didn't you say so? Let's go!
-Whoa!

1019
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:39,273
Hold it! There's a couple
more bags coming from the terminal!

1020
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:41,192
Okay. On three.

1021
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,945
-One, two...
-Too late!

1022
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,905
Put 'em on the next flight!

1023
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,415
-This is bad.
-How are we gonna get outta here?

1024
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,293
Over there! Come on!

1025
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,184
-You sure about this?
-No! Let's go!

1026
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,249
Hold on, Woody!

1027
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:45,715
-What's a cowboy without his hat?
-Buzz!

1028
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:02,231
Buzz! Buzz, get behind the tyres!

1029
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:09,947
Jessie, let go of the plane!

1030
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,365
What? Are you crazy?

1031
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:14,702
Just pretend it's
the final episode of Woody's Roundup.

1032
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:18,080
But it was cancelled!
We never saw if you made it!

1033
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:20,792
Well, then, let's find out together!

1034
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:36,000
We did it! We did it! We did it!

1035
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,099
We did it! We did it! We did it!

1036
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:38,559
Nice ropin', cowboy.

1037
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:42,355
That was definitely
Woody's finest hour!

1038
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,148
Your hat, partner.

1039
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,031
Let's go home.

1040
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,164
Yee-haw!

1041
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:10,049
Hey, Woody! Woody?

1042
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,016
Oh, wow! New toys!

1043
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,018
Cool! Thanks, Mom!

1044
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,897
It's Bazooka Jane
and herjet-propelled horse!

1045
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:29,610
Woody, Buzz, that polecat Zurg
has stolen my space cows!

1046
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:41,038
Andy, come on, hon. Time to go.

1047
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:43,833
-Hey, you fixed Woody!
-Yeah.

1048
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:48,462
Glad I decided not to take him to camp.
His whole arm might have come off.

1049
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:55,678
Well, what do you know?

1050
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:57,972
Yee-haw!

1051
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,432
Oh, Bullseye,

1052
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:02,101
we're part of a family again!

1053
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,733
Ma'am, I...

1054
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,277
I wanted to say
you're a bright young woman

1055
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:13,237
with a beautiful "yarnful" of hair.

1056
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,489
"Hairful" of yarn. It's...

1057
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,658
I must go.

1058
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:21,495
Well, aren't you the sweetest
space toy I ever met?

1059
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,583
What's that? Bark, bark?

1060
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:29,503
This fella says he needs to go out
back for a little private time.

1061
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:31,589
That critter needs help!

1062
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:45,102
Hey, Rex,
I could use a hand over here, buddy.

1063
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:48,022
I don't need to play. I've lived it!

1064
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:50,274
No, no, no, no! Oh, nuts!

1065
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:52,860
Welcome to Al's Toy Barn.

1066
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:55,738
We've got the lowest prices in town.

1067
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:59,492
Everything for a buck, buck, buck.

1068
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:03,829
Well, I guess crime doesn't pay.

1069
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:07,208
Oh, Andy did a great job, huh?
Nice and strong!

1070
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,919
I like it. Makes you look tough.

1071
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,132
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

1072
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:19,178
You saved their lives? Oh, my hero!

1073
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:22,807
And they're so adorable!
Let's adopt them!

1074
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,016
Daddy!

1075
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,643
Oh, no.

1076
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,063
Wheezy, you're fixed!

1077
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:33,526
Oh, yeah. Mr. Shark looked in the toy
box and found me an extra squeaker.

1078
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:36,696
-And how do you feel?
-Oh, I feel swell.

1079
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:40,741
In fact, I think I feel a song comin' on.

1080
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:47,873
You've got a friend in me

1081
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:50,751
You've got a friend in me

1082
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:54,505
You just remember
what your old pal said

1083
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:58,259
Babe, you've got a friend in me

1084
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,886
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1085
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:04,390
Come on over.
Oh, you are such a big girl.

1086
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:06,559
Andy, you think she's ready
to drive the car yet?

1087
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:08,477
Yeah, and I can teach her.

1088
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,313
-You still worried?
-About Andy?

1089
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:15,776
-Nah. It'll be fun while it lasts.
-I'm proud of you, cowboy.

1090
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:20,489
Besides, when it all ends, I'll have old
Buzz Lightyear to keep me company

1091
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:23,200
for infinity and beyond.

1092
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:28,080
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1093
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,586
-You've got a friend in me
-Yes, you do

1094
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:37,381
-You've got a friend in me
-That's the truth

1095
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,717
You've got a friend

1096
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:44,972
ln me

1097
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:47,808
Yeah!

1098
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:50,895
-Speed.
-Marker.

1099
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,396
And action.

1100
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:03,324
Okay. A little help here, please.

1101
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,873
-What are we gonna do, Buzz?
-Use your head!

1102
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:13,417
But I don't wanna use my head!

1103
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:19,256
-Speed.
-Marker.

1104
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:20,966
Okay, and pull back.

1105
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,807
-I don't remember eating that.
-Cut.

1106
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,767
-I can't believe this.
-That's the fifth time.

1107
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:31,727
-What row is that guy in?
-Sorry.

1108
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:35,397
I had that bean burrito for lunch.
Okay, I'm all right now. Sorry.

1109
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:37,441
And action.

1110
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:42,488
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

1111
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:46,909
And if you get hungry,
here's some cheese puffs. And a key.

1112
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:49,203
I don't know what it's for,
but you never know.

1113
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:51,205
-Speed.
-Marker.

1114
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,665
And action.

1115
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,382
Could...? Should we just...?

1116
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,008
Should that just be part
of the movie now?

1117
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:05,886
He lost... He lost his string.

1118
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:11,684
And the golf ball,
if you have time for golf.

1119
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:16,647
And a plastic steak
and a rubber ducky and a yo-yo.

1120
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:18,858
-Who's behind?
-Mine.

1121
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:24,572
All right, cut. Good take.

1122
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,241
What good acting.
That was a good take.

1123
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:29,952
You're such a cute little bottom.

1124
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:32,121
Look at you. Look at you.
Look at you. Look at you.

1125
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:36,834
In fact, I think I feel a song comin' on.

1126
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:41,630
Mr. Mike, I'm so sorry.
Did I hurt your equipment?

1127
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,799
You gotta aim it right here at my flipper.

1128
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:45,467
I'm not a very good catch.

1129
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:48,137
-Okay, I'm ready for another take.
-Let's go again.

1130
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:54,351
Oh, no! Oh, no,
I think I swallowed my squeaker!

1131
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:58,981
And an extra-bouncy bouncy ball.

1132
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:02,484
And some extra teeth.
Be careful, they chatter.

1133
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:03,903
Whoa!

1134
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:06,989
-Marker.
-And action.

1135
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:17,124
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

1136
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:19,293
What? What're you laughing about?

1137
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:22,671
Real funny, Woody.

1138
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:25,215
We're losing our light.
Wipe it off and let's go again.

1139
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,760
Golly bob howdy.

1140
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:32,056
What? What's so funny? Woody!

1141
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,188
-Darn it, Woody!
-Okay, let's go again.

1142
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:42,816
And crayons, in case you get bored.

1143
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:44,860
And some blue Play-Doh.

1144
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,992
Isn't this exciting, Heimlich?
Our first day of shooting.

1145
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:54,495
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's so exciting!

1146
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:57,748
You know, I can't believe you talked
them into making A Bug's Life 2.

1147
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:00,584
Yeah, I can hardly believe it also.

1148
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:04,588
But there's a little baby tiny thing
I forgot to tell you.

1149
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:05,673
What's that, Heimlich?

1150
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:10,844
Well, it's a "2" movie,
but it's not A Bug's Life 2.

1151
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:13,472
What...? I don't understand.
What is it then?

1152
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:14,974
And action.

1153
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:19,645
-Marker.
-And action.

1154
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:21,981
Bullseye, are you with me?

1155
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,691
Okay, good boy.

1156
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:24,942
Prospector, how 'bout you?

1157
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:28,237
And so, you two are
absolutely identical?

1158
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,991
You know, I'm sure I could get you
a part in Toy Story 3.

1159
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:33,951
I'm sorry. Are we back?

1160
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,662
All right, girls.
Lovely talking with you.

1161
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:39,957
Anytime you'd like some tips on acting,
I'd be glad to chat with you.

1162
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,292
All right, off you go then.

1163
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:44,920
-Speed.
-Let me check focus.

1164
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:46,839
Did you make it
into the first Toy Story?

1165
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:50,300
In the letterbox copy, you can see
my arm grabbing Woody's ankle.

1166
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:51,385
What will you do next?

1167
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:53,762
I'm up for this villain
in a toothpaste commercial.

1168
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:55,180
Wow, that's great.

1169
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:59,184
And a dime, call me.
And monkey chow.

1170
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:00,853
Monkey chow? For what?

1171
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:03,397
Well, for the monkeys, of course.

1172
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:04,898
Come on, monkeys.

1173
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:09,319
That's it. I draw the line at monkeys.
Get my agent on the phone!

1174
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,614
-Marker.
-And action.

1175
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,241
It's your choice, Woody.

1176
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:18,704
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

1177
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:23,333
Good heavens. Was that me?

1178
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:28,213
Oh, my. I am so sorry.

1179
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:31,508
I guess that's why they call me
Stinky Pete.

1180
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:33,010
Okay, let's cut.

1181
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:35,220
We are so glad you came.

1182
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:38,098
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1183
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:40,434
Bye-bye, now. Bye. Bye-bye.

1184
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:44,396
Remember, please discard all candy
wrappers and popcorn containers

1185
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:47,649
in the nearest trash receptacle.
Thank you.

1186
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:51,195
Okay, bye-bye, now. Bye-bye. Bye.

1187
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:54,239
Okay.

1188
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:55,866
Are they all gone?

1189
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:58,952
Is everybody gone?

1190
01:30:59,037 --> 01:31:00,579
Huh?

1191
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:04,416
Good. Oh, my gosh,
my cheeks are killing me.

1192
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:08,504
I can't keep smiling like this any more.
I am exhausted.

1193
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:10,672
I think I need a break.

1194
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:12,013
A little break? Okay.

1195
01:31:13,757 --> 01:31:18,013
