1
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,493
Did you see it? I think I got it.

2
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,162
That little piggy was fast.

3
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,834
Hey, everybody, this is all of our kill.
We all take credit.

4
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,587
- I got a side ache.
- You hit Enmebaragesi.

5
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,882
I'm pretty sure he had that
when he left the village.

6
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,510
That's not my spear.

7
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,055
My spear has feathers...
Okay, that one's got a feather.

8
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,683
Okay, that is my spear.
I'm sorry, man.

9
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,562
Great. Two spears.
Twice the killing power.

10
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,774
Thanks a lot.
Next time don't block my shot.

11
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,195
What? I didn't say-
Come on, not my fault.

12
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,990
Who stands in front of a boar
on a hunt?

13
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,124
Hey, there you are.

14
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,711
I don't think you wanna be gathered.
You wanna be eaten.

15
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,341
Hi, Marlak.

16
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,555
Well, there won't be any berries
in the fruit salad now, so we all lose.

17
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,223
Hey, Oh. How's it going?

18
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,601
Hunters think they're so cool.
You know, they-

19
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,271
They don't think this is challenging?
Gathering? It's extremely challenging.

20
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,900
You have to find all the fruit with
the least amount of bird shit on it...

21
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,359
...and put it in the basket.

22
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,611
Are they picking on you?

23
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,280
If they're picking on you,
I will straighten them out.

24
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,949
- All right. Yeah, would you?
- You're right.

25
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,409
Let it slide this time.

26
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,579
Next time, though, they will feel the tip
of my short spear.

27
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,083
- What happened to your spear?
- I modified it. Made it a snub nose.

28
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,296
It's lighter. It's a better killing tool.
Anyway...

29
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,841
Oh, there's Maya.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

30
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,845
I'll be right back.
Unless something goes horribly right.

31
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,099
- Hello, Maya.
- Hey, Zed.

32
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,852
What do I gotta do
to make you my woman?

33
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:55,150
Look, you're a special guy.
You've got a lot of personality.

34
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,403
When my parents
were killed by that pack of wild dogs...

35
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,281
...you really helped me
see the funny side.

36
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,952
"No, no! He's got my ankle!"

37
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,331
"Get off. " That's your mom.

38
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,628
So, yeah, you make me laugh,
but that's not enough.

39
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,421
I'm an old-fashioned kind of girl.

40
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,549
I need a man who can protect me
and take care of me.

41
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,260
What do you mean?
Like Marlak?

42
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,137
Well, I mean, he is the best hunter
in the village.

43
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,139
- Debatable.
- People voted.

44
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,350
Maybe I'm not the greatest hunter.

45
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,894
- Or gatherer.
- Yes. Or gatherer.

46
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,522
Zed, those are the only two jobs
that we have here.

47
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,525
I can take care of you.
Does it look like I'm starving?

48
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,362
Come on.
Tell me you can say no to this.

49
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,824
Give it a second. Let it work on you.

50
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,202
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely can say no to that.

51
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,414
Maya. Can I see you later?

52
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,334
I think I have to wash my hair.

53
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,755
You washed your hair last year.

54
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,721
Tonight, we feast.

55
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,185
Maya. For you.

56
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,856
Thanks, Marlak.
Another severed boar's head.

57
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,191
- It's a different color.
- Yeah, this one is-

58
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,611
- Left the tongue in.
- Yeah, this is really nice, Marlak.

59
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,699
Look at Marlak flirting with Maya.
He doesn't know her at all.

60
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,784
Head's not even the best part
of the boar.

61
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:32,706
It's the back fat, stupid.
Muscleheaded idiot.

62
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:37,210
Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema.

63
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,089
Yeah. She doesn't even know I exist.

64
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,009
There's like 60 people
in the village. I mean...

65
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,304
...you have to go out of your way
to not know that somebody exists.

66
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,556
I just wanna lay with her so badly.

67
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,976
I don't see it. She's cute,
but I don't think I'd lay with her.

68
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,229
She's your sister. I mean,
that'd be like laying with your mother.

69
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,358
Which was a big mistake.
I see that now.

70
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,987
You think it's not gonna be awkward
in the morning, but- Trust me, wow.

71
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,866
Listen, you wanna impress Eema?
Do the fertility dance with her...

72
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,286
...at the feast tonight
then drag her back to your hut.

73
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,122
My hut's a mess right now,
and what if she struggles?

74
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,417
You give her a little tap on the head.
Women respond to that.

75
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,086
I still live with my parents.

76
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,130
I don't wanna keep them up all night
with my raucous lovemaking.

77
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,925
I'd get an earful in the morning.
She only likes hunters.

78
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,178
She doesn't like gatherers.
She's a gatherer herself is the irony.

79
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,805
She's a self-loathing gatherer.

80
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,294
- That's pretty suggestive.
- I wouldn't read too much into that.

81
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:40,298
Okay, now she's just asking
for some splinters.

82
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:43,927
Hey, hey- Squanto.
Give me a break, would you?

83
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:46,262
You got the whole forest.

84
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,891
Why does everybody always have
to take a crap right behind my hut?

85
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:53,311
Where are we going?
We're not supposed to go this far.

86
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,980
I'm sick of the whole village
treating me like a joke.

87
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:58,483
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Change villages.

88
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,319
No. I'm gonna change my head.

89
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,965
I don't think that's possible.
Your head is attached to your body.

90
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,801
Not the whole head.
I mean, my mind.

91
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,136
Mind-

92
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,888
Don't tell me you're thinking
about eating forbidden fruit.

93
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,599
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

94
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,769
Zed, that's the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil.

95
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,313
You don't eat from that one.
It's forbidden.

96
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,731
But why is it forbidden?

97
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,817
What is it they don't want us
to have?

98
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,445
It's not the fruit. It's about the rule.
It's about doing what you're told.

99
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,031
We've been doing what we were told
our entire lives.

100
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,659
- How's that worked out?
- I like doing what I'm told.

101
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,162
It gives my day
some much-needed structure. Wait.

102
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,122
Zed. Stop.
It's just a piece of fruit.

103
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,332
Eating a fruit
is not gonna change your life.

104
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,251
What if it's magic fruit?

105
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,255
What if this makes me the smartest
man the village has ever known?

106
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,840
That's a pretty low bar.

107
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,259
Then all the hunters
would have to bow down to me.

108
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,969
Maya would lay with me like that.

109
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,138
That's what this is about?
Laying with Maya?

110
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,932
I have a great destiny,
I'm about to find out what it is.

111
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,185
Put the fruit down.
What if somebody sees us?

112
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,229
They'll peel our skin off
and tie us to an anthill.

113
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,691
Now you've done it.

114
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,862
It's got sort of a knowledge-y taste.

115
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,032
Does it have a sort of forbidden taste?
That's what it is.

116
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,243
- Oh, I definitely feel something.
- What?

117
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,956
Less hungry, for one,
but also more intelligenter.

118
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,335
It's like
I feel like maybe I know everything.

119
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,590
Ask me something. Anything. Go.
Test me. Go.

120
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,009
All right, where does the sun go
at night?

121
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,261
Pass. Next question.

122
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,806
- Okay, where do babies come from?
- Pass. Next question.

123
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,228
- There's a snake on my foot.
- In the form of a question.

124
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,188
There's a snake on my foot?

125
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,942
- Correct.
- What do I do?

126
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:51,321
I got a lot of ideas. I'm bursting
with ideas on the subject.

127
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,991
- It's constricting me.
- You could stick your finger in its hole.

128
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,953
You know what, you could eat it
before it eats you. Try that.

129
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,830
Eat the snake first.
That's what my new brain tells me.

130
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,083
- It's preparing to eat me.
- Go for the eyes.

131
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,252
It's big.

132
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,587
Zed, please help me.

133
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:12,202
I'm dying a virgin.

134
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,663
Wait right here.
I'm gonna go eat more fruit.

135
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:32,264
- This was a bit of a rough day for me.
- Yeah. There's gotta be more to life.

136
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:35,517
This is a lot. I don't think I can handle
too much more than this.

137
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:37,727
No way. Look at these people.

138
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:41,356
They're like animals.
We're way too good for this.

139
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:43,859
Now that I'm smarter
I'm going straight to the top.

140
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:46,278
I'm bringing you.
You're gonna be my right hand.

141
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:48,780
I've seen what you do
with your right hand. No.

142
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:51,658
Don't you wonder what's on
the other side of the mountains?

143
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:54,452
There's nothing on the other side
of the mountains, okay?

144
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,873
The world ends. Everybody
knows that. You'd fall right off of it.

145
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,249
But what if it doesn't?

146
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,169
It makes my stomach go:

147
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,714
I've been thinking a lot
ever since I ate that fruit.

148
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:08,300
Why is there fruit? What is fruit?

149
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:11,553
It's a thing that you eat.
Why do we eat?

150
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:15,223
What are we? What are we?
Why do I have these?

151
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:17,267
Everything is weird.

152
00:10:17,435 --> 00:10:21,062
When you really stop and look at it,
everything gets very, very strange-

153
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,689
Why am I talking? What is this?

154
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:25,066
My lips make a movement
and then a sound...

155
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:27,152
...and you know what I mean.

156
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,154
Blows my mind.

157
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,283
That just sounds like crazy fruit talk.
I don't wanna hear it right now.

158
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:35,410
Boy, she looks nice tonight.

159
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:40,415
Do it, man. Dance for her.

160
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,626
I don't know.
They're doing the jackal dance.

161
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:44,252
It's not my strongest.

162
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,797
What, are you kidding me?
You have an amazing jackal dance.

163
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:50,926
Go. Jackal dance.

164
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:13,281
Get into it.

165
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,456
Over the head.

166
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:42,560
I'm gonna go and eat.
I'm gonna come back.

167
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,693
Your father was a great hunter.
But you, you're like a little girl.

168
00:11:51,153 --> 00:11:52,195
Good one, Marlak.

169
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,449
Enmebaragesi says
he saw you in the garden.

170
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:59,869
Really? Well, what if I told you
that Enmebaragesi was a liar?

171
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:02,580
I saw him eat the forbidden fruit.

172
00:12:02,748 --> 00:12:05,208
Oh, that.

173
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:10,672
- Hey, what's going on here?
- I will kill you where you stand.

174
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,675
Oh, a shooting star. That's the best.

175
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:29,691
- You really ate the fruit?
- One bite. What's the big deal?

176
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:32,027
You don't eat the fruit.

177
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:34,654
It's the number one rule
since the beginning of time.

178
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:38,033
Since the Great Turtle climbed out
of the sea with Earth on its back.

179
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,036
I know, but I'm a little fuzzy
on the exact details.

180
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:43,788
Forbidden. Forbidden fruit.

181
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:49,669
You ate- You did the one thing
you're not supposed to do. Forbidden.

182
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:53,631
But the word "forbidden" implies
there's a little wiggle room.

183
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,968
There's no wiggle room
with forbidden. You're cursed, man.

184
00:12:57,136 --> 00:13:01,473
If you stay here, we'll all be cursed.
You have to leave.

185
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,267
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I didn't eat the fruit.

186
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:05,477
My hands are tied.

187
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:09,147
I wish there was something I could do
for you, Zed, but I can't.

188
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:13,401
You really... You fucked the pooch
on this one.

189
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,839
You better get out of here.

190
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,385
Okay, but before I go,
I just wanna say one thing.

191
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,096
I know I'm not the greatest hunter.

192
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,850
- Or gatherer.
- Or gatherer. Thank you.

193
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,019
But there's gotta be more to life
than this.

194
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,772
I'm going, but because I choose to.

195
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:39,359
And anyone who wants to join me
is welcome.

196
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:42,695
I don't know where we're going,
but I will lead us.

197
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,907
Yeah, light up the darkness.

198
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,951
So who's with me?

199
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,538
Anyone?

200
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,376
Anyone named Oh?

201
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,380
Okay. Looks like
I'm gonna be going it alone.

202
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,965
Which is fine with me.

203
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,549
Better, in fact...

204
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,552
...because having a partner
would just probably slow me down.

205
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,763
I'm gonna start a new tribe,
10 times better.

206
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,224
There's gonna be 10 times
more dancing and fun.

207
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:17,397
It's gonna be called Muscle Tribe
of Danger and Excellence.

208
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:21,567
And you're not invited. I don't even like
any of you guys. I never did.

209
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,738
Unless anyone changes their mind.
Does anyone wanna come?

210
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,283
- We're good.
- Fine. Good. Bye-bye.

211
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,079
Don't- Nobody panic.

212
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,299
No! That's- That's-
Oh, it's not my house.

213
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,371
I see you.

214
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,668
Go away, Marlak.

215
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,881
- Really, animal noises?
- Badger.

216
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,218
This is just insulting.
It's time I killed you.

217
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,804
Fine. But then, tell me this:
Who's that behind you?

218
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,641
You think I'm gonna turn around?
I'm gonna gut you like a pig.

219
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:46,277
Nice whack on the head.
You should try hitting Eema that hard.

220
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,821
We can discuss that later.
We should run away.

221
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,157
Yes, yes, of course.

222
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,496
So you decided to come after all.
Was it the speech?

223
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:59,832
- It was the fire. I lost everything.
- Yeah.

224
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,501
I wish we didn't have to leave.

225
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:03,336
Probably never gonna see
Eema again.

226
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,714
That's not true. We'll go back.

227
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,674
Those hunters are idiots.

228
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,052
They're gonna forget the whole thing
in an hour.

229
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,679
Will you get real, man?
There's no going back, okay?

230
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,349
There's nothing to go back to.
It's just ashes.

231
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,726
Like it's hard to build
one of those huts.

232
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,645
It's just a pile of sticks and dung.

233
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,398
Well, you're a pile of sticks
and dung.

234
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:26,734
- I'm sorry, I-
- It's okay.

235
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,362
- I don't mean that, obviously.
- I know you're mad...

236
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,697
...but this is a great
opportunity for us.

237
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,033
They didn't appreciate you
back there.

238
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,370
You're the genius who thought up
drinking water from a gourd.

239
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,372
They were all drinking from their
hands.

240
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,291
Well, it just seems practical.
I mean, I don't know.

241
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,545
We have an incredible destiny.

242
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,215
You don't even know where we are.
We're lost.

243
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,634
Of course I know where we are.

244
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,558
It's a cougar.
Don't move a muscle.

245
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:01,352
- What do we do?
- Don't move your lips.

246
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,356
Rule number one: Show no fear.

247
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,732
You're showing fear.

248
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,903
Much better. Very good.

249
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,073
- Now what?
- There's two opinions on this one.

250
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,411
Some say run,
others say stay perfectly still.

251
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,916
- Which one are you gonna do?
- I'm going to run!

252
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,854
You should put some maggots
on those scratches.

253
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,481
They look pretty deep.

254
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,525
They are very deep.
That's why they appear that way.

255
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,112
- You're still mad at me, aren't you?
- I wish I hadn't come.

256
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,780
Maybe you shouldn't have come...

257
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,700
...if you're gonna keep whining
about every little cougar...

258
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,494
...that attacks you.

259
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,041
Oh, what does this look like?

260
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:08,336
You making your own fire?

261
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,838
No, I'm making arrows.
We're gonna need them.

262
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,506
- You still coming?
- Yeah.

263
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:16,912
Yeah!

264
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:22,667
Yeah. You're my buddy. Yeah.

265
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,544
You're saying we're gonna walk...

266
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:27,756
...and eventually we're gonna get
to a spot where the world ends...

267
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:30,967
...and it's like... What is it?
What are we looking at?

268
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:34,554
First of all, why are you talking to me
in that tone like I'm an idiot?

269
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:36,390
This is general knowledge.

270
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,653
- I knew it!
- This is incredible.

271
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:51,738
You still think the world just ends?

272
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:54,741
Come on, admit it. The fruit man
has the knowledge.

273
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:57,035
Whoa, whoa, be careful.

274
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:02,499
Did you learn a lot when you ate
the fruit?

275
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:05,627
Yeah. I can see, like, 10 minutes
into the future now.

276
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:07,212
So what am I gonna say next?

277
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,756
You're gonna say,
"That's not what I was gonna say. "

278
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:11,258
- That's not what I was-
- See?

279
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:12,467
That's not fair.

280
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:17,347
People. More than one.

281
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:20,767
Walking that way.

282
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:23,353
You think? There's about
a thousand footprints there.

283
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,772
- I mean, it's kind of obvious.
- Oh, yes.

284
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:30,110
- They stopped here to poop. Look.
- No, I don't want to.

285
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:33,613
Two men, maybe three. A child.
Or a small woman, maybe.

286
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:36,616
What are you doing?
You don't know where that's been.

287
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,910
- I know where it's been.
- Don't touch it.

288
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,121
You don't know if a squirrel
has peed on it.

289
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,999
Still warm.
Almost hot in the center.

290
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:48,462
Looks like they had some nuts.
Apples, maybe.

291
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:50,630
What are you doing?

292
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:53,133
- Yep, apples.
- What difference does it make?

293
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:55,135
That doesn't help us to know that.

294
00:19:56,596 --> 00:20:00,348
You can tell if they ate some shit.
There's a lot of shit in that shit.

295
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:02,976
My mistake, this is bear poop.

296
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:04,978
What's that, though?

297
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:15,071
This one's mine.

298
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:19,576
Tonight, we feast.

299
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:31,922
We're gonna need
some arrowheads.

300
00:20:39,597 --> 00:20:42,015
This is where you die!

301
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,161
Easy, easy.

302
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,580
He won't get far.

303
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,460
- Did you shoot my cow?
- Oh, no.

304
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:58,214
Yes. Well, we're hunters.

305
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,965
Well, he's a hunter. I'm a maker.

306
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:05,137
- A maker?
- I made this loincloth. I make arrows.

307
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,723
I've made a shelf unit for my hut.

308
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,311
I welcome us to you.

309
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,897
- What do you do?
- What does it look like?

310
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,692
- We're farmers.
- Well, he's a farmer, I'm a herdsman.

311
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,318
You're a suck is what you are.

312
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,822
- My brother Cain. I'm called Abel.
- You are called "suck".

313
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:25,533
There you go with that "suck. "
What does that mean?

314
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,327
Short for "suckle. "
Short for "suckle up. "

315
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,248
You're suckling up to God.
You're a suckle-up.

316
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,376
Somebody's upset because God
looked on my sacrifice with favor.

317
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,212
"God looked upon my sacrifice
with favor. " I mean-

318
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,923
- Is he a total suck or what?
- Hard to say. We just met.

319
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,842
Why are you bringing these guys
in it?

320
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:44,677
- They live in a tree.
- Oh, see?

321
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,305
I mean, come on. You just gotta be
so superior to everyone else.

322
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,850
No, but superior to- Than you.

323
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:53,936
Superior- Let's see how superior
you are when I kick your ass.

324
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,938
- Oh, yeah?
- You want some of that?

325
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,690
- Yes, I do.
- Guys.

326
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,985
- I'm right here. I'm right here.
- No, come on.

327
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:05,406
No. This smug asshole insulted you,
and I want him to take it back.

328
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,867
- We're not that insulted.
- Why don't you make me?

329
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:10,828
No, no. Boys, boys.
You are brothers. Let's just relax...

330
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,622
...and let's all just get
some perspective-

331
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,376
Yeah. Yeah. That's how we do it.
That's how we do it. That's-

332
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,045
- There are rules that we abide by.
- Yeah, right.

333
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,135
- Should we do something?
- Just let them settle it.

334
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,137
I tripped.

335
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,771
Well, I guess that settles it.

336
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,147
- What?
- Nothing.

337
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:43,986
It's- He's all right.
He's just- He's resting.

338
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,114
Well, he's tuckered out
from the fight.

339
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,283
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's- You know what?

340
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,036
Let's cover him up with a little dirt
and some straw...

341
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,580
...to keep him warm
until he wakes up and...

342
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:58,667
Hey. Abel, what are you doing
with my foot? Playing possum?

343
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:03,088
Hey. Oh, hey, stop it.
He's choking me.

344
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,551
Stop it, Abel. Are you trying
to choke me to death, Abel?

345
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,095
"Yes, Cain, I am. "
Come on, stop it!

346
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:14,225
Self-defense. Clearly. Self-defense.

347
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,854
What have I done?
What have I done?

348
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,824
What have I done again?
What have I done some more?

349
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,712
What have I continued to do?

350
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,174
Oh, guys.
Guys, we're in some real trouble here.

351
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,009
What do you mean "we"?

352
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,637
I don't wanna play the blame game
but you hit him.

353
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,223
No, no, no. There's two of you
and there's one of me.

354
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,393
- You could have stopped me.
- Didn't know you were gonna kill him.

355
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,813
- Are you calling me a murderer?
- Did I say that?

356
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,066
It was an accident. Right?

357
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,485
Yeah, you were holding a rock...

358
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,988
...and he ran into it
with his face repeatedly...

359
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:11,699
...until he just couldn't pull through.

360
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,659
- It was horseplay.
- It was horseplay.

361
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,703
It was two horses playing.

362
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,664
One murders the other one...

363
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,503
Yeah. It's probably best if we
didn't mention this accident to anyone.

364
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,172
Because, you know,
people don't understand, and-

365
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,507
Who am I gonna tell?

366
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,676
I can't think of one
who'd be interested.

367
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,053
I'd only tell him
and he's a witness as well.

368
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,347
- Why even bring it up?
- Okay.

369
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,392
- It's like he killed himself.
- Cry for help, if anything.

370
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,020
All right. Good.

371
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:46,859
I like you guys. I do.
I like you guys a lot. I do.

372
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,278
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

373
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,531
- We already have dinner plans.
- Damn.

374
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,451
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

375
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,703
We'll come over to your place
for supper.

376
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,205
I mean, how many times
do we see you?

377
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,666
- Just don't kill me.
- No horseplay.

378
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,710
- What?
- Nothing.

379
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,006
What are these big,
round things for?

380
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,800
They're wheels, numbskull.
They make the cart roll.

381
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,402
I feel like a bird.

382
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,406
Bring it forth.

383
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,628
Hello.

384
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,759
I'm gonna yak.

385
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,764
Hey. What's wrong with you?

386
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,142
- Let me get your hair.
- That was too fast.

387
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:17,199
Cain, I ask you again,
where is thy brother Abel?

388
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,369
I don't know.
I haven't really seen him at all.

389
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:24,790
Have you- You guys...
You guys haven't seen him, have you?

390
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,001
- Don't know who that is.
- I don't- Never-

391
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,045
- Don't know who you're talking about.
- What's his name?

392
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,674
- Sure he's out there somewhere...
- I haven't seen anybody anywhere.

393
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,844
Never had the pleasure.
Sure he's in the prime of his life.

394
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,472
This is good soup. Really good.

395
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,017
Lilith said she saw you
in the field with him.

396
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,811
Oh, man, this bread is good.

397
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:50,899
Oh, really? That- Oh, yeah.
No, that was yesterday, right.

398
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,485
No, this day.
She said you both made offerings.

399
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,321
- Oh, that was Boaz. Yeah.
- No.

400
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,198
- Japheth. It was Japheth.
- No.

401
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,742
- Enoch.
- No.

402
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,368
- I'm sure it was Gilgamesh.
- No.

403
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,037
- Ishmael.
- No.

404
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,329
- Ezidia?
- No.

405
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,748
- Jennifer?
- No.

406
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,125
Now I'm remembering correctly.
It was Tishbaven.

407
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,753
It was you. She said
it looked like you were arguing.

408
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:16,216
Yeah, well, let's be honest.
Lilith is a lying bitch.

409
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:19,720
Look, I mean, we're brothers.
We're gonna argue, it's human nature.

410
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,015
- Show me the perfect family.
- His flock goes untended in the field.

411
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,601
Okay, look. Enough.
Am I his keeper?

412
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,854
I mean, just get off my back, Father.

413
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:33,358
I wish you were dead too.
Even though Abel's not dead at all.

414
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:37,279
I fear the worst for Abel.
I'm sorely vexed.

415
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:40,365
You're welcome to spend this night
with us.

416
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,409
You may lay with my daughter Lilith.

417
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,204
She is without a husband...

418
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,873
...and as the Lord said,
"Be fruitful and multiply. "

419
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,417
What about me?

420
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,753
You may share the bed
of my son Seth.

421
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,380
- Thanks, Papa.
- Yeah, there you go.

422
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,050
I multiplied with sheep.

423
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,554
Hello.

424
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,101
Feeling fruitful?

425
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:11,814
My bed is small but you're welcome
to share it. It's the way of my people.

426
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,233
That is such a good way to be.

427
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:21,615
In fact, I'm kind of surprised a pretty
girl like you is sleeping alone, anyway.

428
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,201
I'd have thought
guys would be lined up at the door.

429
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,622
- Oh. I don't like men.
- Maybe...

430
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,500
...you just ain't met the right one yet.

431
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,255
Loincloth rising.

432
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:46,765
- No, I like girls.
- We have that in common.

433
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,643
No, I'm attracted to women.

434
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,692
I don't even know what that means.

435
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,532
- What does that mean?
- I like to have sex with other women.

436
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,619
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
All my brain blood was in my boner.

437
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,460
That was a such good one.

438
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,129
Okay, here we go. Ready, ready?

439
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,799
No, wait.

440
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,977
Little surprise on the end
of that one, right?

441
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,313
- Very good.
- One more, ready?

442
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,819
No, we're good.
Oh, do you wanna see a trick?

443
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,488
Do I have to?

444
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:47,100
It's been a great sleepover...

445
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:51,187
...and thank you
for the gruel and the garb.

446
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:51,938
Cain.

447
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,334
- Where's everybody going?
- To look for thy brother Abel.

448
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,502
- Good luck.
- What?

449
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,756
I said, good luck, Father.
I'm really worried about him.

450
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,049
You're not coming?

451
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:05,344
I'm just gonna stay here
and finish toiling...

452
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:09,264
- ... and then we'll be right behind you.
- Good.

453
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,228
Hey, I'm heading to the coast.
You guys should come with me.

454
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,690
They're gonna try to blame this
whole Abel-killing business on you.

455
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,984
- Why blame it on us?
- When they find him...

456
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,780
...and see his head, they're gonna
start pointing fingers. You're drifters.

457
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,698
They're gonna put two
and two together.

458
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,077
Now stop asking so many questions
and let's go. Go, go, go.

459
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,631
Cain. After him.

460
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,224
- They're gaining on us.
- They're getting away.

461
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:56,228
- Eat my dust, Father.
- This is really too fast.

462
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,563
- Oh, no, no.
- Hold tight. Hold tight.

463
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,734
Cain! My justice will be swift.

464
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,156
No. No! Damn you, Cain.

465
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,742
Who's in God's favor now, Father?

466
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:21,878
What are the odds of that?
Hey, am I lucky or what?

467
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,088
Your head's smoking.

468
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,800
Hey, it didn't leave a mark, did it?

469
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:30,762
Just a pink, red hole.

470
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,266
- Your bangs are gonna cover it.
- All right. Whatever.

471
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,855
This is the biggest place
I've ever seen.

472
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,275
It's called a town. Just act normal.

473
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:46,570
- Hi.
- Hello. Greetings, seafarer.

474
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,155
- That's not normal.
- Hello.

475
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:50,782
Would you stop saying
hi to everybody. It's annoying.

476
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,327
All right, this is a market.
Over there is a Build-A-Bear.

477
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:58,999
That's a really good container store.
Oh, this place has killer hemp.

478
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:04,046
- Yes, please.
- Next up is an unusual item.

479
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,051
- He's big. He's strong.
- It's Marlak.

480
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,512
Oh, do not worry. He is not fighting,
he is having fun.

481
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,059
Okay, maybe he's
little bit depressed.

482
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,854
Maya and Eema.

483
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,066
- Zed.
- Eema.

484
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,902
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi. Gosh.

485
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,196
What happened?
How did you get here?

486
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:32,574
After the fire that you started,
the hill tribes raided the village.

487
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,825
They held us captive...

488
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,079
...and traded us to the boat people,
who brought us here.

489
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,499
So it's such a coincidence
to run into you guys like this here.

490
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,001
- You think it's a coincidence?
- What do you think?

491
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:47,923
I'm not sure, but I'm beginning to think
that everything happens for a reason.

492
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,760
God wanted me to have
knowledge of good and evil.

493
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,763
- Why would he want that?
- Why are we assuming God's a he?

494
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:00,185
I don't know what to say to that.

495
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,729
You kidding?

496
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,191
Anyway, don't you guys see
what I'm saying?

497
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,484
Why would he choose you?

498
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,694
Why wouldn't he choose
someone stronger?

499
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,572
Chosen doesn't have to be strong.
I'm big like this.

500
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,950
- You have a fat face.
- My brain. It's enormous.

501
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,285
I'm smarter than you are.
I don't talk as much.

502
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,204
I'm the smartest guy in the village.

503
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,414
I'm the smartest guy
that was in the village.

504
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,251
Excuse me,
you are interested in some slaves?

505
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,211
Yes.

506
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,048
- This one looks pretty good.
- And her little friend. Very good.

507
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,716
- Just how I like them.
- Hey.

508
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,301
Feisty.

509
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,554
So how do we do this
if we want them?

510
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,224
You have money?

511
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,143
That depends
on what you mean by money.

512
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,563
Excuse me.
Perhaps I could be of some help here.

513
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,275
You guys, let me deal with this guy,
see if I can work out a deal.

514
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:50,443
What happened to your forehead?

515
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:54,239
I didn't murder my brother. I didn't.

516
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,907
All right, I'm just gonna-

517
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,243
We're gonna get you out of this.
You trust me?

518
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:03,248
- I want to trust you.
- Fair enough.

519
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:10,448
Next up is a twofer.
It is two for price of one.

520
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:13,118
Have a great vacation.

521
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:14,786
Never trusted that guy.

522
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:16,997
Because he murdered his brother
with a rock?

523
00:34:17,164 --> 00:34:20,584
Is that why you didn't trust him?
You got great instincts.

524
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:32,637
Look, I want you to know...

525
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:35,682
...I blame myself for everything
that's happened.

526
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:40,312
- Yeah. So does everybody else.
- Hey, stay away from my woman.

527
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:43,523
She's not your woman.
You can't own people.

528
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:46,901
Except for the guy who bought
all of us. Apparently, he can.

529
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:06,171
Take the slaves!

530
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:08,923
Go!

531
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:15,805
Eema, run like a cougar
is chasing you.

532
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:18,892
- Zed!
- Eema.

533
00:35:19,727 --> 00:35:21,353
Come here, you two.

534
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:23,855
Go, go, go, go.

535
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:38,578
Sir, shall we pursue the slaves?

536
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,790
Let the desert have them.
They won't get far.

537
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,708
Yes, sir.

538
00:35:57,765 --> 00:35:59,933
- Orders, sir?
- Tend to the slaves.

539
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:02,227
- We leave for Sodom before daybreak.
- Yes, sir.

540
00:36:02,395 --> 00:36:03,603
I wonder who they are.

541
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,371
Their hats are really great,
aren't they?

542
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,872
Their hats?

543
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,083
When that guy
cut the other guy's head off...

544
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,252
...I wasn't thinking about
what a great hat.

545
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,298
It wasn't my very first thought, but I'd
be lying if I said it wasn't up there.

546
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,883
I'm just saying, if I can snag one,
I'm going to.

547
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,095
Now I just have to figure out a way
to rescue Maya and Eema.

548
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,598
How are we gonna rescue them?
These guys are killers.

549
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,602
Even killers have to sleep sometime.

550
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,321
That was refreshing.

551
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,992
Shit!

552
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,079
They're gone.

553
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,998
Now where do we go?

554
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:54,085
They said they were going to Sodom.
We're going to Sodom.

555
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:59,591
I think I have sand in my ass,
but there's no way of knowing for sure.

556
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,761
I'll take a look in it
when we get to Sodom.

557
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,848
We making a burnt offering
or something?

558
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,393
Yes, Isaac.
As God has commanded me.

559
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,270
But I don't see the sheep anywhere.

560
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:17,025
The Lord. The Lord shall provide
the sheep, my son.

561
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,444
What is this?
Is this some sort of magic trick?

562
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,655
In a way. In a way.

563
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,035
If this is because I didn't clean up
my tent, I'm sorry.

564
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,162
I'll do it right when I get home.

565
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,830
Oh, Dad, why are you doing this?

566
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:35,210
The Lord has spoken unto me, Isaac,
and I must obey him.

567
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,630
If the Lord told you to jump off a cliff,
would you do it?

568
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,882
- Forgive me, Isaac.
- My God.

569
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,468
Stop! What are you doing
with that kid?

570
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,555
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

571
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,475
This is my son, sir.
We were playing a game.

572
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:54,646
All right?
It's called Burny Burny Cut Cut.

573
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,023
You weren't.
You were gonna kill him.

574
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,902
I was not going to kill him.
I was going to sacrifice him.

575
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,488
- There is a tremendous difference.
- Not to him.

576
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:09,327
By what right dost thou interfere?
Art thou sent by the Lord?

577
00:38:10,996 --> 00:38:13,206
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.

578
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,709
- Aye. Aye, verily, thou art.
- Verily. Yea.

579
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:21,005
Thou were sent by the Eternal One
to stay my hand.

580
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,843
- All of that.
- This is Isaac.

581
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,347
And I am Abraham, the son of Terah
of the House of Nahor.

582
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:34,018
We were two doors down from Nahor.
We were Nahor's neighbors.

583
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,020
And I am Zed, son of Zero.

584
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:40,358
And this is Oh, son of Ooh
from the House of Sticks and Dung.

585
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,902
The tents of my kinsmen
lie just beyond.

586
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,697
Come. Come, my friends.

587
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,490
We are the Hebrews.

588
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:51,369
A righteous people,
but not very good at sports.

589
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,079
This way, friends. Come.

590
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,874
Brothers, brothers.

591
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,420
Let us give thanks
unto the Lord thy God...

592
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,632
...for staying my hand on the mountain
this very day.

593
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,844
Praise be to God,
hallowed be his name.

594
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,387
And let us also praise him...

595
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,765
...for the bounty
which he hath bestowed unto us.

596
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,434
He hath increased our wealth...

597
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,102
...and blessed us with-

598
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,397
Thanks. Thank you.
A lot of loving things.

599
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,899
- Kind loving kindness.
- Yeah.

600
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:23,067
Friends, whence comest thou?

601
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,489
- He wants to know where you're from.
- Thou comest not from...

602
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,533
...the Cities of the Plain,
from Sodom and Gomorrah.

603
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,952
- Heard of them, never been there.
- Are they nice?

604
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,329
"Are they nice"?

605
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,248
They have been cursed for all time
by the Lord thy God...

606
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,834
- ... for their abominations.
- I did not know that.

607
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:43,254
They worship idols
and they bow down before false gods.

608
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,256
- Abdominal.
- It's the worst.

609
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,426
The men of that city
are weak and soft...

610
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,804
...fat with rich food,
intoxicated by strong drink.

611
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,182
I'm not hearing the bad part.

612
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,684
The women are whores.

613
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,270
Their shameless lust
knows no bounds.

614
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,688
They flaunt their flesh...

615
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:04,275
...and any man may have knowledge
of them whenever he so chooseth.

616
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,278
Which one of the two cities
has the most whores?

617
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,866
Just so we know to stay away
from that one especially.

618
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:15,286
Walk you not the path of Sodom.

619
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,830
For the Lord thy God
has said unto me...

620
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,917
...that he shall send a holy fire
to destroy that city...

621
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,962
...and all who dwell within
for their iniquity.

622
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,048
He shall smite them.

623
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,969
Them, and all of their seed.

624
00:40:32,137 --> 00:40:35,014
So when do you think
this smiting's gonna go down?

625
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,309
- Because we have some friends there.
- Their fate is sealed.

626
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,312
But for my faith and devotion...

627
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,647
...that self-same God...

628
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,609
...has promised unto me
the whole of this land.

629
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:51,155
From the Heights of Golan in the north
to the Sinai in the south.

630
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,367
From the river of Jordan
to the great sea.

631
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,579
- This is all your land?
- For all of eternity.

632
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,081
But apparently God
forgot to tell anyone else.

633
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,166
We're at war with someone
every other day.

634
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,420
Excuse me. I and my kinsmen
have vanquished our enemies...

635
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,214
...by the mighty hand
of God, blessed be he.

636
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,550
- Praised is his name...
- Unto us.

637
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,094
- ... and glory his graciousness.
- Wealthy bounty.

638
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:17,265
Therefore, to signify my covenant
with the one true God...

639
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:22,103
...I shall on this day
circumcise the flesh of my penis.

640
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:28,192
And of you. And you, and of you,
and every male who dwelleth hereby.

641
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,029
- Excuse me?
- I don't know what you mean.

642
00:41:31,196 --> 00:41:34,282
We shall grasp the foreskins
of our penises...

643
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,869
...and we shall cut therefrom
the extra flesh. Amen.

644
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,540
I don't think I have any extra.

645
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,335
- Couldn't we pierce our ears?
- No, no, no.

646
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:47,879
So it shall be written,
and so it shall be done.

647
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,285
Let me get this straight. You're saying
you have too much...?

648
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:52,494
And you wanna:

649
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:57,833
You know, Abe, it's been a long day,
we've all had a lot to drink...

650
00:41:58,001 --> 00:42:01,545
...and I know that this foreskin thing
sounds like a good idea now...

651
00:42:01,713 --> 00:42:03,756
...but you might wanna sleep on it.

652
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:05,758
We can always cut it off
in the morning.

653
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:09,136
But if we do it now, there's just no way
to get it back on there.

654
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,222
No, no, no, trust me, it's gonna be
a very, very sleek look.

655
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:16,601
This is gonna catch on. I'm gonna go
get my good knife.

656
00:42:18,563 --> 00:42:22,274
Just wait right there. I'll be right back
to cut your penises.

657
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:26,862
Not the whole thing,
you understand. Just the very tip.

658
00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:30,240
And after, we're all gonna have wine
and sponge cake.

659
00:42:32,785 --> 00:42:34,661
Do you have any idea
where we're going?

660
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:36,955
Going to Sodom.
We have to save Maya and Eema.

661
00:42:37,123 --> 00:42:39,666
He said that God
was gonna smite Sodom with holy fire.

662
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:42,127
God also told him to chop off
the tip of his dick.

663
00:42:42,295 --> 00:42:47,716
Dad, no! No! No!

664
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:52,137
So listen, I've been thinking,
what constitutes the tip of the penis?

665
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:55,140
Because his definition
might not be the same as mine.

666
00:42:55,308 --> 00:42:58,852
- What if the tip is your favorite part?
- The tip is your only part.

667
00:43:02,774 --> 00:43:04,566
Come out here.

668
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:08,320
Hey, you caught me. Guilty.

669
00:43:08,488 --> 00:43:09,571
What are you doing here?

670
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:12,073
- I'm gonna come.
- You don't know where we're going.

671
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:13,825
- You're going to Sodom, right?
- No.

672
00:43:13,993 --> 00:43:16,703
How stupid you think I am?
You've had a boner for Sodom...

673
00:43:16,871 --> 00:43:19,748
...since my dad mentioned it.
If I take you, get me some wine.

674
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:21,374
Aren't you a bit young?

675
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:22,793
Do you like hanging out
with this little girl?

676
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,186
Did you or did you not
hear me scream?

677
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,480
I think I deserve a drink.

678
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,191
That's Sodom right there.
The Unholy Land.

679
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:36,404
The devil's playground,
where the sinners are winners.

680
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,283
Me and my boys sneak in here
on the weekends sometimes.

681
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,077
Pick up on the babes,
drink some wine, smoke some herb.

682
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,663
- Shouldn't be smoking either.
- Thanks a lot, Grandpa.

683
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,666
I've been smoking for four harvests
now, so I think I'm good.

684
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,087
These doors are enormous.

685
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,841
- It looks like they're not open, so-
- You just gotta knock.

686
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,010
- They let me in all the time.
- Yeah, knock.

687
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,636
- Why don't you knock?
- You knock.

688
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,806
- What if we're waking somebody?
- Eema and Maya might be in there.

689
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,683
I gave them our word
we'd rescue them.

690
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,519
Hey, ladies.
We don't got no foreskins.

691
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,524
- Halt. Halt.
- Get help. Tell your father.

692
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,486
Like I'm gonna tell my father
I came with you guys to Sodom.

693
00:44:16,653 --> 00:44:17,862
So long, suckers.

694
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,448
I kind of get why his dad
wanted to kill him.

695
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,535
Get in.

696
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:29,207
- What's this, then?
- They were banging on the gate.

697
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:33,211
- Hebrews from the look of them.
- Well, we're not really Hebrews.

698
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,714
We are Hebrews?

699
00:44:37,382 --> 00:44:39,008
I get it. No talking.

700
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,219
- Should we wake the commander?
- Oh, no.

701
00:44:41,386 --> 00:44:45,598
Don't want to wake the commander.
He gets mean when you wake him.

702
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,725
Meaner than this?

703
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,689
Let go of his titty.

704
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,734
Yeah. Okay. All right, good one.

705
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:01,155
What the bloody hell
is going on out there?

706
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:08,788
Who screamed?
Sounded like a woman.

707
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:13,084
But you don't look like a woman.
You wanna kiss me?

708
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,419
Like in a romantic way?

709
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,590
By tomorrow morning,
you'll wish you hadn't been born.

710
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,717
- I already feel that way right now.
- Yeah.

711
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,886
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size.

712
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:28,474
Because that I would pay to see.
You versus a guy your size.

713
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,436
Give me my stick.

714
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,985
Bumpy. You got a smoother one?

715
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,987
Yeah.

716
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:43,614
Turn around
and put your hands on the table.

717
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,158
Now!

718
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,953
I'll take that kiss now.

719
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,291
- We'll start with the fat one.
- Relatively fat. I mean...

720
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:57,003
- Welcome to Sodom.
- Hey, I want a piece of that.

721
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:01,048
- Cain?
- You know them?

722
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,302
Brothers.

723
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:11,392
I missed you so much. Oh, you guys.
Promise you'll never leave me again.

724
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,106
- This is amazing.
- And this is a Monday.

725
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,108
You should see this place
on a Thursday.

726
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,486
- Because Thursday's the new Friday.
- Well, thanks for saving us.

727
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,490
- What are you gonna do to us now?
- Excuse me? Do I detect a tone here?

728
00:46:26,908 --> 00:46:28,659
You did sell us into slavery.

729
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:32,038
Hold a grudge much?
That was, like, a fortnight ago.

730
00:46:32,205 --> 00:46:34,332
It was less than a fortnight.
Half a fortnight.

731
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:37,627
- It was a sevennight.
- Oh, give me a break.

732
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,503
I was dealing with the death...

733
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:43,007
...of a close, personal family member
and I needed some space.

734
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:47,219
But hey, now I realize that you guys
are like my real brothers.

735
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:51,932
And it's so rare to have a brother
that you love and don't wanna kill.

736
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,018
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

737
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,603
Hey, who's hungry?

738
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,021
- I'm hungry.
- Don't kill me.

739
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,856
Yeah? Okay.

740
00:46:59,524 --> 00:47:01,901
Excuse me, I was...

741
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,988
Yeah, that's two for flinching.
Hey, let's go.

742
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,868
Here. Now we're even.

743
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,539
Check out the woman across the way.
She's looking at us.

744
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:19,543
She's totally eye-knowing us
with her eyes right now.

745
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,485
Well, she's really making
that banana last.

746
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,907
- Go talk to her.
- I kind of have a girlfriend right now.

747
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:53,160
A girl that I'm going to marry.

748
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:56,997
Make my wife, make her my girlfriend
one day when I get enough strength.

749
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:00,626
What transpires within the confines
of the walls of Sodom...

750
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,754
...stays within the confines of the walls
of Sodom.

751
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:08,426
If you guys are gonna stay here,
you should join the guard.

752
00:48:08,593 --> 00:48:11,846
- Hey!
- Hey, hey what, hey? Huh? Yeah.

753
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,182
I mean, the pay's not great
but the perks, tons of them.

754
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:19,603
I'm telling you, it's the only way to go.
Come on, let's go talk to the sergeant.

755
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,815
- Let's go.
- Hurry now.

756
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:31,115
This is great. How do I look?

757
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:35,035
I can't see. This is too big on me.
I wonder if I can get a smaller size.

758
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:39,290
Yeah, someone's gotta be
the hat person around here.

759
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,125
- Find a...
- Excuse me.

760
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,503
Hey, my helmet is way too big
for me. It looks really silly.

761
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,506
- Think I can get a smaller one?
- Line up!

762
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:54,180
- What are you doing? In the line.
- Wait, he's not...

763
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,974
In the line. Face forward in the line.

764
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,310
- Guys. Guys?
- I don't know where to...

765
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,312
- Guys.
- You too!

766
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,483
- Guys.
- Find a hole, you stupid bastards.

767
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,651
- It's kind of obvious, isn't it?
- Not to me.

768
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,237
Soldiers. Present arms.

769
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,828
I never got a sword.
I only got the holder.

770
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:21,332
I didn't know
that that's what it was for.

771
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,877
- So this is it? We just walk around?
- Yeah, pretty much.

772
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,337
Just look for troublemakers.

773
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:30,508
If you see a thief or a pickpocket,
we'll slap them around a little bit.

774
00:49:30,675 --> 00:49:34,804
Maybe cut off a finger, you know,
or tip of the nose sometimes.

775
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:39,517
Lower lip. Just anything you can grab
and slice in one fluid motion.

776
00:49:39,684 --> 00:49:40,935
It seems kind of harsh.

777
00:49:41,102 --> 00:49:45,856
Hey, just remember it's the palace
that pays us, not the people. Come on.

778
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,359
Feed us!

779
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:56,242
Six sacrifices in the last 10 days
and still no rain.

780
00:49:56,409 --> 00:50:00,412
Majesty, there's talk of revolution
in the streets.

781
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,123
Oil and grain are scarce,
prices are high.

782
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:07,795
Starving peasants are pouring
into the city in search of food.

783
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,840
We could actually have a riot
on our hands.

784
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:14,218
Poverty has a bitter taste,
but it is a flavor they are born to.

785
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:18,597
It is the will of the gods.
What do the entrails predict?

786
00:50:20,725 --> 00:50:26,063
Well, the liver is streaked with gray,
which is not a good sign...

787
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,692
...but his poor rectum
is absolutely pulverized...

788
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,778
...which is not unusual
for a sheep in this region.

789
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,738
The genitals are enormous.

790
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,241
That's of no significance,
I'm just commenting.

791
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,201
If you do look at this intestine...

792
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,787
...his large intestine
is arranged in an arc...

793
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,623
...then the two massive balls
of the sheep are like eyes.

794
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,459
To me, I see a happy face.
That makes me happy.

795
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,295
What does it mean?

796
00:50:49,462 --> 00:50:54,300
Well, could mean a surprise visit
from a former friend or sweetheart.

797
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:56,802
Or that you're going
on a long sea voyage.

798
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,804
Could I come?
I've never been on a boat.

799
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,432
How did you become high priest?

800
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,726
I'm your brother-in-law.

801
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,312
Perhaps it's time
for a new high priest.

802
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:16,113
Perhaps it's not time
for a new high priest.

803
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,250
Let that be a warning to you.

804
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:33,088
Next time, I shall hurl a lightning bolt
right in your face.

805
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,007
Or a fireball.

806
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,844
And you know what's the best part
about Sodom? The sodomy.

807
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,971
You guys are in for a treat.

808
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,575
Down.

809
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,911
Did you see that girl?

810
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,663
That was Princess Inanna.

811
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,499
She's totally hot.
Don't even think about it.

812
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:09,875
Why not?

813
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,920
Why? Because she's royalty
and you're a caveman.

814
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,380
Where's everybody going?

815
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:16,715
To the temple.
You guys have to see this.

816
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,176
- Will she be there?
- Yeah, everyone'll be there.

817
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,272
There she is.

818
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,410
The princess isn't eating.

819
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:47,162
I find it hard to eat
when so many are hungry.

820
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,541
- You can't keep starving yourself.
- Why not?

821
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,711
Everybody else is starving.
Present company excluded.

822
00:52:53,878 --> 00:52:55,462
Careful, princess.

823
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,008
You may be my stepdaughter,
but these are dangerous times...

824
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:02,720
- ... and those are dangerous words.
- Whatever.

825
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,847
Hi.

826
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,558
Yeah.

827
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,112
- What's happening?
- They're picking a virgin.

828
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:28,162
Oh, please. If you're a virgin,
then I'm a fuzzy little gerbil.

829
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:31,749
Back to the whorehouse with you.
Quick as a bunny. There you go.

830
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,375
What do they need a virgin for?

831
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,795
- To throw her in the fire. Are you new?
- What? Why?

832
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,965
An offering to the gods.

833
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,760
- Are you serious?
- There's a famine going on...

834
00:53:42,927 --> 00:53:45,345
...so if we make
a good enough sacrifice...

835
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:48,932
...then the gods give us rain.
You get rain, you get harvest...

836
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,769
...you get harvest, you get food.
You know what food is?

837
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:54,396
Yeah, you know food.

838
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,524
So they're gonna throw a virgin
into the fire so that it rains?

839
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,944
Did I do something to offend you?

840
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:04,490
I come here, I get a great seat
at the sacrifice, and you're ruining it.

841
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,453
Seems like a waste
of a perfectly good virgin to me.

842
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,998
Hey, guys? I'm trying to enjoy
the sacrifice with my family.

843
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,209
Do you mind? Do you mind?

844
00:54:15,376 --> 00:54:16,627
For the love of the gods...

845
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,505
...we commit this fair maiden...

846
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:23,425
...to Moloch's holy fire.

847
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,974
These virgins, it's always a girl?

848
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:34,353
I'm really happy for her.
She was always the runner-up.

849
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,562
True success story.

850
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,816
My lord,
the princess wishes to see you.

851
00:54:38,983 --> 00:54:40,859
Me? What about my friend?

852
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,736
Can the two of us come?
We're a pair.

853
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,739
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The three of us are like a pair.

854
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:49,368
No, not you.
The two of you, follow me.

855
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,161
Great.

856
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,873
- I'll try to put a good word in for you.
- Yeah, do.

857
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:58,836
If we never, ever see you again,
it's not because we're avoiding you.

858
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,171
Don't forget about me.

859
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:07,678
This is Zaftig, the eunuch.
You, go with him.

860
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,763
Oh, can't I go with him?

861
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:14,601
- Why? Is he your lover?
- No, we're just friends.

862
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,520
That would be weird.
We're both guys.

863
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,191
- Come with me.
- What do you do?

864
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,902
I've been a palace eunuch
since I was 9 years old.

865
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,780
- How would I become a eunuch?
- They cut off your testicles.

866
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,699
Why all the genital mutilation?

867
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:33,162
Well, you get to keep them.
I always keep mine close at hand.

868
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,122
Would you like to see?

869
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,623
No.

870
00:55:47,051 --> 00:55:48,260
Can I ask your opinion?

871
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,722
What do you think?
Ponytail or no ponytail?

872
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,934
- I don't know and I really don't care.
- Okay. I just wanted to know...

873
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:59,605
...what the ladies of Sodom
were into nowadays, but...

874
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,275
This party is insane.

875
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:07,404
It's more of a hair-down
kind of scene, I'd say.

876
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,574
Hi.

877
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,293
Be sure to try the fruit.

878
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,340
Maya. What are you doing here?

879
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:29,259
Okay, I'm still alive,
thank you for asking...

880
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,136
...and I'm still a slave.

881
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:34,514
I was coming to rescue you. Really.
That's why we were here.

882
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,099
- We were gonna find you.
- Yeah?

883
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:39,102
You seemed worried
about your ponytail just a second ago.

884
00:56:40,104 --> 00:56:41,355
I was just-

885
00:56:41,522 --> 00:56:43,941
- You were just chosen again.
- I was.

886
00:56:44,108 --> 00:56:46,693
I would love to join you at this orgy,
but I can't...

887
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:51,490
...because I have to go be a slave,
and I don't get any breaks.

888
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,452
And the princess has crabs.

889
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:03,126
Oh, yes, it's steamy.

890
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,296
God, that's realistic.

891
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,298
Watch it, jerk.

892
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,051
A real woman, that's...

893
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,178
Oh, excuse me, Miss...

894
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:17,891
Ter. Mister. Awkward.

895
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,896
Good concentration.

896
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,983
You're good. You're real good.

897
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:33,657
- Oh? Is that you?
- I'm not supposed to talk, I'm a statue.

898
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:38,870
- Yeah, you look so gold.
- It's all the gold paint.

899
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,998
- How's it going?
- It's going great.

900
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:45,168
I just had my entire body
painted by a fat guy with no balls.

901
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:48,505
- Oh, how did that go?
- He was extremely thorough.

902
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:50,841
- How's it going with you?
- Not bad.

903
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,011
Just had a little rub and scrub.
Now I'm up for some grub.

904
00:57:54,178 --> 00:57:55,762
- Sounds luxurious.
- Hey.

905
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:59,558
You remember that woman
who brought us in with the face dress?

906
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:03,228
That was Maya. She's working here
now and she looks great.

907
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,772
- Kind of mad at me, though.
- And there's Eema.

908
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,941
Come here, wench.

909
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,943
Let me have a look
what's up that skirt.

910
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,324
- I'm sorry, it was an accident.
- It was no accident.

911
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:20,537
Hey. You. Slave girl.
I told you to fetch me more wine.

912
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:24,291
- Apologize to this officer now.
- I'm sorry.

913
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:28,420
Good. Now go fetch.
Wait over there by the skinny statue.

914
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,465
I'll deal with you later. Go!

915
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,553
Slaves. What are you gonna do?

916
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,556
Wait a minute.

917
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,975
Don't I know you?

918
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,574
- What are you, crazy?
- I will not serve these people.

919
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,243
- I'd rather die.
- Keep it up. You will.

920
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:01,661
Have you joined them?

921
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,081
I haven't joined anything.
I'm not having fun.

922
00:59:04,248 --> 00:59:06,750
I'm just checking it out.
A lot to learn here.

923
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,921
- What, human sacrifice?
- No. No human sacrifices.

924
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,173
I've been chosen
to do something great.

925
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,591
Yeah, here we go.

926
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:19,304
I'm pretty sure it's not hunting pigs
and weaving baskets.

927
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,598
- Oh?
- Hello, Maya.

928
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,771
She wants to see you. Now.

929
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,481
Don't think
I'm interested in her.

930
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,025
- Whyever would I think that?
- It's part of my plan.

931
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,152
I'm gonna get us out of here
soon as I can.

932
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,489
- The princess awaits you.
- And I await her.

933
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:42,285
You two, await me.
Stay out of trouble. Stay gold.

934
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,454
He has no idea what he's doing,
does he?

935
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:48,542
- It's nice to see you like this.
- It's nice to see you too.

936
00:59:48,709 --> 00:59:50,961
We should do something.
When do you get off?

937
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:55,465
- Never. I'm a slave.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

938
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,135
Slave girl, bring me a towel.

939
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:00,971
Yeah, I should go be a slave.

940
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,598
I'm gonna strike a specific pose,
I guess.

941
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,560
- Okay.
- I love you.

942
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:17,654
You there. Golden boy.
Come here.

943
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,831
Rub me with oil.

944
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,126
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
That's not-

945
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,545
I'm not one of the oil rubbers,
I'm just a guard.

946
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,505
Rub me with oil or die.

947
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,894
- Is that enough?
- Much more. Baste me like a chicken.

948
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:53,732
Oh, yes. Pour it all over me,
you little bronze bitchlet.

949
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:56,693
Yeah, okay. You got the whole thing
on you now.

950
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,320
Marvelous, I love it.

951
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,948
All right, well, have a good evening.
I'm glad I could help you out.

952
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:04,284
Now rub it in.

953
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,245
With my hand?

954
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,916
No. With your nutsack.
Of course, with your hand.

955
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,214
Oh, yes.

956
01:01:17,381 --> 01:01:19,132
Oh, yes, the oily oiliness.

957
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,552
The musky, precious,
smoky, oily oiliness.

958
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,889
Yes, that's right.
Oh, God, paint a picture on my body.

959
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,849
- Tell a story on my nipples.
- Yeah.

960
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,644
That's right, take me down
the smoky Euphrates.

961
01:01:30,811 --> 01:01:33,104
Do something
you'll be ashamed of later...

962
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,815
...you naughty little goat.
All right, charm the snake.

963
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,276
- Eema. Hey...
- Oh, just like that. Now slap me.

964
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:41,488
- This isn't what it looks like.
- My tummy. Go ahead, slap me.

965
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,908
- Slap me. Slap the tummy.
- No, it's fine. I mean, I understand.

966
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,328
Go on. I love it, I love it.
Oh, you're very gifted.

967
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:51,748
No, no, no. I'm just rubbing oil
on this man's chest. Eema.

968
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:55,210
A gift. I don't know,
you've got some sort of gift.

969
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:05,762
- Good luck.
- Look, Maya. Maya.

970
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,473
Come to me.

971
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:13,937
Beautiful, isn't it?

972
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,439
You can see Gomorrah
just over the hill.

973
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:19,651
Yep. Twin cities.

974
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,279
People think that the gods
are gonna wipe them out...

975
01:02:22,446 --> 01:02:25,782
- ... because they're so evil.
- And what do you think? Am I evil?

976
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:29,869
Well, I don't really know you,
but you don't look evil.

977
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,788
Do you find me attractive?

978
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,542
Yeah.

979
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,043
Let me ask you one thing.

980
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,754
What would a girl like you
want with a guy like me?

981
01:02:40,464 --> 01:02:45,427
I don't know.
I just find you interesting.

982
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,804
They say it's the will of the gods...

983
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:50,473
...that some men should suffer
while others rule.

984
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:53,143
That we're all just victims
of our own fate.

985
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,061
I believed that until this morning...

986
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:58,898
...when I saw you standing up alone
in the square and I said to myself:

987
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:03,862
"Yes! Finally, here's one man
who refuses to bow down to anything.

988
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,906
A man with the courage
to question the order of things.

989
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:12,412
A man chosen by the gods
to do something great. "

990
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,414
That's exactly
what I've been thinking.

991
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,833
You would not believe the stuff
happening to me.

992
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,544
- I just didn't know why.
- I know why.

993
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:25,008
To bring you here. To this place.
To me.

994
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:28,053
I could not agree more.

995
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,765
I'm trying to agree more, but I can't,
because that's how much I agree.

996
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,351
Come.

997
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,189
This must be difficult
for you to understand...

998
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:42,108
...but my life is devoted
to the service of the gods...

999
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:45,403
...and the good of the people.
I keep nothing for myself.

1000
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:50,867
- That's very unselfish of you.
- It is unselfish of me, isn't it?

1001
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,119
You're so perceptive
for one so young.

1002
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:57,290
- Yeah. What are those doors there?
- Behind these doors...

1003
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:01,378
...is the Holy of Holies,
earthly domain of the gods.

1004
01:04:01,545 --> 01:04:03,755
A place so ineffably sacred,
so powerful...

1005
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,132
...that to enter is instant death.

1006
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,803
- Who cleans it?
- Needs no cleaning.

1007
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:12,514
Kind of makes you think
about the people that built it.

1008
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,391
Like, did they die instantly...

1009
01:04:14,558 --> 01:04:16,476
...or were they given
a courtesy second...

1010
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,478
...to get out of there by the gods?

1011
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:21,356
They were allowed to finish,
given four and a half seconds,

1012
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,525
then the gods descended.

1013
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,487
- What if a bug goes in there?
- Instant death for the bug.

1014
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:30,573
Are there dead bugs all over?
Because nobody cleans it.

1015
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,701
They're vaporized immediately...

1016
01:04:32,868 --> 01:04:37,122
...by a holy beam
of vapory fire vapor.

1017
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:40,208
- Can we go in?
- I just told you.

1018
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:44,003
To enter is instant death,
you gorgeous little dunce.

1019
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,714
Can't even poke our heads in?

1020
01:04:45,881 --> 01:04:47,799
You're so young and curious,
aren't you?

1021
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:51,344
You want to know it all
and taste it all, explore it all, be it all...

1022
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:54,431
...dance with it all, suck it all,
don't you?

1023
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,933
I've got a riddle for you.

1024
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:58,852
What has two thumbs...

1025
01:04:59,019 --> 01:05:01,187
...and is desperate
for another hot-oil rub?

1026
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:04,315
- What?
- This person.

1027
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:06,693
Come on. Let's go.

1028
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:11,823
This way.

1029
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:16,369
What are we doing here?

1030
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:19,539
I want you to enter
the Holy of Holies.

1031
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:21,624
Oh, that is quite a coincidence...

1032
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,794
...because I want you to sit
on the Poley of Poleys.

1033
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,133
- Oh, no. That's the Holy of Holies.
- I thought you were talking about-

1034
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:33,511
You have to go in there
and speak to the gods.

1035
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,139
- The gods are in there?
- So they say.

1036
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,725
The only one who goes in there
is the high priest.

1037
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,644
They say it's instant death
for anyone else to enter.

1038
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:46,065
- Then why am I going in?
- Because you've been chosen.

1039
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:49,110
If the gods wanted you dead,
they would've killed you already.

1040
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,155
- Right.
- This is what you've been chosen for.

1041
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,657
To speak to the gods,
divine their purpose...

1042
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:58,161
...and plead with them
to end this terrible famine.

1043
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,747
Then come back out
and tell me what it's like inside.

1044
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:01,956
- Okay.
- Okay.

1045
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,500
Right.

1046
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,675
I'm pretty sure I'm chosen,
but I'm not "sure" sure.

1047
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,511
You're chosen.

1048
01:06:14,678 --> 01:06:18,014
Okay. I'm gonna go in,
but you gotta do something for me.

1049
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:21,184
- You gotta let my friends go.
- Anything.

1050
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:37,367
Don't kill me, don't kill me,
don't kill me-

1051
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:40,537
Get up. You look ridiculous.

1052
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,543
- Oh? What are you doing here?
- I'm hiding from the high priest.

1053
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:48,878
I spent the last two hours
rubbing oil on him.

1054
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,714
Is that chest hair?

1055
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:54,092
Not all of it. Just don't ask, okay?

1056
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,345
I've lost my sense
of right and wrong.

1057
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,056
How did you get in here
without getting fried?

1058
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:02,684
- I don't know. How did you?
- Because I'm a chosen.

1059
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,062
Probably why God didn't kill you:
He knew you were my follower.

1060
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,982
- I'm not your follower.
- Why are you always following me?

1061
01:07:09,149 --> 01:07:12,694
I'm not following you. I walk
behind you at the same pace as you.

1062
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,071
Not following.
I could be leading from the rear.

1063
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:18,449
Come on. I'm the leader.
I always have been.

1064
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,743
Some leader.
Told us you were gonna get us out.

1065
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:24,080
- Just been messing around at orgies.
- Messing around at orgies?

1066
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:25,582
No, no. I'm not like you.

1067
01:07:25,749 --> 01:07:28,418
I don't get to prance around
in gold paint and have fun.

1068
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:31,754
- I have no downtime.
- Please. Your whole life is downtime.

1069
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:34,299
That's what you think?
That's what everybody thinks.

1070
01:07:34,466 --> 01:07:37,468
I'm about to show you something.
Observe.

1071
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:46,936
Almighty God, or gods,
whatever the case may be...

1072
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:49,439
...I need to ask a favor of you.

1073
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,357
I know
I've really messed things up...

1074
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:56,029
...but I really need to come through
on this one...

1075
01:07:56,822 --> 01:08:00,325
...and I wanna ask you to please give
me the strength to free my friends.

1076
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:04,287
- And that's it, that's the favor.
- Oh, shit.

1077
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:09,208
And also,
if you could just make it rain...

1078
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:14,130
...or like drizzle without us having
to kill a virgin, you know what I mean?

1079
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:17,634
Because we need our virgins
at the moment.

1080
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,970
And also, if you could give me
the power...

1081
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:23,890
...to see through women's clothing
without them knowing...

1082
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:26,059
...that would be really great.

1083
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:28,978
Hello?

1084
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:31,564
Hasn't it occurred to you
that it might be silent...

1085
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:35,401
...because God is not in here?
Look around. There's nothing in here.

1086
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:38,196
That doesn't prove anything.
Maybe he stepped away.

1087
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,239
- For what?
- God stuff.

1088
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,825
If he needs something,
he can create it from nothing.

1089
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:45,828
What's the point of being God
if you keep running for things?

1090
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:49,999
Let me just put something out there.
Maybe God doesn't exist.

1091
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,671
What? So everything is just random?

1092
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:56,673
Then nothing would mean anything.

1093
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,925
- What would be the point?
- That is the point.

1094
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:01,010
That there's no point? That's stupid.

1095
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:02,261
- You're stupid.
- No.

1096
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:05,598
- There's something bigger than me.
- There's nothing bigger than you.

1097
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,850
- Don't touch my belly to make a point.
- Fine.

1098
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:11,562
- Okay. I'm sorry, I have a man's body.
- I'm maturing at my own pace.

1099
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:15,191
- You are so jealous of me.
- Jealous? That you're a bullshit artist?

1100
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,444
That every time you speak,
it's bullshit coming out of your mouth?

1101
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:21,781
You would believe in God
if you've ever been with a woman.

1102
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:24,367
- I'm a virgin by choice.
- Not your choice.

1103
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,327
- Take that back.
- I won't.

1104
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,830
- Take back what you said.
- Take back what you said.

1105
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,373
Everything you've ever said.

1106
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,792
Don't stand close.
Get your belly off of my belly.

1107
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,210
Don't touch my belly.

1108
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,629
I don't want to touch bellies with you,
ever.

1109
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,548
Take everything
you've ever said back.

1110
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,717
- You're out of control.
- You're a freak.

1111
01:09:40,884 --> 01:09:44,387
- Stop screaming, stop screaming.
- You're a freak! Get off me.

1112
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:51,602
I can pull this thing together.
The princess is right out there.

1113
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,229
And if I play this right...

1114
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:56,482
...I'm gonna get us all out of here,
Maya and Eema too.

1115
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,818
Just trust in me. Have a little faith.

1116
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:02,655
Fine, but not for you. For Eema.
And I'm too tired to argue right now.

1117
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:06,325
I had a long hot bath with the
high priest, and I'm lightheaded.

1118
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:08,911
I'm sorry for squeezing you so hard.

1119
01:10:09,913 --> 01:10:12,081
Let's go. Freak.

1120
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,963
God, if you do exist,
if you make Eema love me...

1121
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:22,467
...I would be very grateful. Okay?

1122
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:25,053
If you do exist.

1123
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:30,767
You guys waiting to go in there?

1124
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:33,061
Because I gotta say:
Not that big a deal.

1125
01:10:33,228 --> 01:10:35,980
If you see a broken penis,
it was like that when we went in.

1126
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,190
Seize him.

1127
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,318
I'm seized.

1128
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:49,619
I wish I was upside down.

1129
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,498
Looks kind of fun.

1130
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,542
Is it fun?

1131
01:10:58,962 --> 01:11:01,047
So you're not talking to me?

1132
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:03,800
We're not friends anymore,
after all I've done for you?

1133
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:06,803
- What have you done for me?
- I brought you out of your shell.

1134
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:10,306
Yeah? I liked my shell.
I liked the village.

1135
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:13,935
Because of you, I'm in this horrible
place where brothers kill brothers...

1136
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,854
...and they burn women
and they make people slaves.

1137
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:18,981
People cut off
the ends of their penises...

1138
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:22,110
...and their testicles and I'm
never gonna see Eema again...

1139
01:11:22,277 --> 01:11:23,820
...and it's because of you.

1140
01:11:23,987 --> 01:11:27,490
Please forgive me.
I mean, you are my best friend.

1141
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,909
I hate the world! I hate you!

1142
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:33,913
And now I'm hanging upside down
and I really have to pee.

1143
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,540
I know I'm not perfect.

1144
01:11:35,707 --> 01:11:40,002
And maybe I made a few wrong turns,
but you gotta understand I'm chosen.

1145
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,839
That's a lot of responsibility.
You can't even imagine.

1146
01:11:43,006 --> 01:11:46,509
The only one that thinks that you're
chosen is you. So shut up already!

1147
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:50,847
I'm gonna get us out of this thing
if it's the last thing I do.

1148
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:06,779
That was just my first idea.

1149
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:08,698
I'm also accepting ideas.

1150
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:12,702
Guard!
The upside down prisoner has to pee!

1151
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:15,872
Oh, I'm peeing.

1152
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:19,959
Oh, no.

1153
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,711
Try to keep your mouth closed.

1154
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,800
Oh, no. In the nose.

1155
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:36,601
Hey, I'm peeing on my face too,
on the inside.

1156
01:12:36,768 --> 01:12:38,477
I hate you.

1157
01:12:48,488 --> 01:12:49,989
Observe, my dear...

1158
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,783
...since it was you
who lured him to his death.

1159
01:12:54,369 --> 01:12:57,830
"For the crimes of blasphemy...

1160
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:00,583
...heresy...

1161
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:02,793
...conspiracy... "

1162
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:05,421
- What you thinking about?
- "Treachery...

1163
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:06,839
...leprosy... "

1164
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:08,341
Trying to make conversation.

1165
01:13:08,508 --> 01:13:10,092
"Puppetry...

1166
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:13,888
- ... hyperbole... "
- Your hair looks really good today.

1167
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:17,141
- I peed all over it.
- Then that's the secret, I guess.

1168
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:18,935
"Sodomy... "

1169
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,357
- Oh, it's "refusal of sodomy. "
- Yeah!

1170
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:26,859
Can you just forgive me?

1171
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:28,611
I think I hate you too much.

1172
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,948
"Lechery
and the murder of my brother, Abel. "

1173
01:13:32,115 --> 01:13:33,783
- Oh, come on!
- Shut it!

1174
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:37,203
For these, and other crimes...

1175
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:40,498
...the prisoners shall be stoned...

1176
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,124
...to death!

1177
01:13:44,127 --> 01:13:47,964
- Wait! Can I make a suggestion?
- What?

1178
01:13:48,131 --> 01:13:51,384
Just have one person throw stones
at us.

1179
01:13:51,551 --> 01:13:56,764
In fact, I think it would be fair if you
let us choose who gets to stone us.

1180
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:00,393
No. That doesn't make any-

1181
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:02,979
- We want that guy.
- That guy.

1182
01:14:03,146 --> 01:14:05,106
- Me?
- That's our stoner.

1183
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:08,317
What, just because I'm a eunuch
you don't think I can throw?

1184
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:10,486
I'll show you throwing.

1185
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:13,906
No, no. No, no, no! Gross.

1186
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:18,369
Did he just hurl his own ball at him?
How spectacular.

1187
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:21,038
No! That doesn't count.
That was a testicle.

1188
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:22,373
I think it counts.

1189
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,875
- Pick somebody else.
- What is that idiot doing?

1190
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:27,878
- I pick that guy!
- Nice.

1191
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:29,714
- This guy?
- No, no, the shorter man.

1192
01:14:29,881 --> 01:14:31,841
Right in front of him.

1193
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,509
It's a kid. This is a kid.

1194
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:36,345
So? You got something against kids?
This guy hates kids.

1195
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:39,181
- Let me smite him!
- Kid hater!

1196
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:42,685
- One shot!
- No, they're our future!

1197
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:45,354
All right. Hey, go ahead and-

1198
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:47,440
Okay. I'm hit.

1199
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:51,861
Holy shit, that kid's got an arm.

1200
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,030
God. There's two of us.

1201
01:14:54,197 --> 01:14:55,239
Are you guys happy now?

1202
01:14:55,407 --> 01:15:01,537
Okay! Everybody on this side,
on the count of three! One, two-

1203
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:04,707
Wait! I have a question for the king.

1204
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,962
Why didn't I die in the Holy of Holies?

1205
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:17,720
Yes! I entered the Holy of Holies
and, lo, I did not die.

1206
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:23,267
Why? Because I was chosen
by the gods!

1207
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:33,319
Spare the chosen one!
Spare the chosen one!

1208
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,280
- Spare the chosen one!
- And his friend!

1209
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:39,658
- And his young friend.
- Don't kill either of them.

1210
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:42,411
Everyone knows
the chosen gets a plus one.

1211
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:44,580
Is it possible? Is he truly chosen?

1212
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:47,917
Well, of course it's possible.
Highly doubtful.

1213
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,753
Majesty, with respect...

1214
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:54,298
...whether he is chosen or not
is no longer the issue.

1215
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:57,301
If you were to kill him now,
given the public mood...

1216
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:00,513
...it could inflame the situation
so as...

1217
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:06,018
...to cause a radical regime change.

1218
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:09,688
If you take my meaning.

1219
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:13,442
Yes, that will do.

1220
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:23,953
It is the judgment of our merciful king
that the prisoners be enslaved...

1221
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:30,543
...to toil at hard labor until they die
of starvation or exhaustion!

1222
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,752
Yes!

1223
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,963
And how is that better?

1224
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,852
You seem to enjoy your work.
How long have you been a slave?

1225
01:16:48,019 --> 01:16:50,271
Oh, I'm not a slave. I'm a volunteer.

1226
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:56,652
Marlak. Enmebaragesi.
Long time no see.

1227
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,072
I deserve that.

1228
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,534
Take these bricks up top.
The masons are waiting.

1229
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:07,496
I would but I did something to my
neck. I think I slept on it funny.

1230
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:11,000
I should probably take it easy,
or I'll be no good for work tomorrow.

1231
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,085
Move!

1232
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:15,713
You know,
the mud's really good for your skin.

1233
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,424
- Yeah.
- Ask me why my skin's so good.

1234
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:20,885
- Why's your skin-?
- The mud.

1235
01:17:21,052 --> 01:17:22,553
I knew you were gonna say that.

1236
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:29,518
You gotta love being outside.

1237
01:17:30,086 --> 01:17:32,045
Move it!

1238
01:17:33,089 --> 01:17:34,589
Faster!

1239
01:17:44,392 --> 01:17:46,893
You two, up! Get on line. Now.

1240
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:49,437
- Where are we going?
- To watch the sacrifice.

1241
01:17:49,605 --> 01:17:52,148
- The king demands it.
- Is it compulsory?

1242
01:17:52,316 --> 01:17:56,403
There was some work that I wanted to
finish doing, get a jump on tomorrow.

1243
01:17:57,238 --> 01:17:59,906
I'd like to see how big you are
without that whip.

1244
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:02,784
Same basic size.

1245
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:06,222
All is in readiness, Your Majesty.

1246
01:18:06,389 --> 01:18:08,390
What now?
More virgins to sacrifice?

1247
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:14,230
Yes, two. Your own handmaiden
and another slave.

1248
01:18:14,397 --> 01:18:18,275
Followers of the chosen one.
Discovered by this loyal soldier.

1249
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:21,987
Oh, I was just doing my job.
It's what I do.

1250
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:27,826
And one more to demonstrate
our own faith and charity.

1251
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:32,915
For the love of the people,
and the heavenly gift of rain...

1252
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:36,669
...we offer a humble sacrifice:

1253
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:39,755
our own stepdaughter...

1254
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:42,633
...the Princess Inanna.

1255
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:49,098
- You're insane.
- For the good of the people, darling.

1256
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:51,100
- You wouldn't dare.
- Wouldn't I?

1257
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,435
If you like,
I can arrange for you to join her.

1258
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:57,898
Mother.

1259
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,693
How long did you think
I would tolerate your insolence?

1260
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,445
Burn her.

1261
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:12,705
Drink it. You won't feel a thing.

1262
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:21,630
Are they booing me?
How dare they.

1263
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:23,799
They love you.
They're wooing you.

1264
01:19:30,765 --> 01:19:33,183
That's fine. You know?

1265
01:19:44,904 --> 01:19:49,033
It's Maya! And Eema!
Wait, Maya's a virgin?

1266
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,242
No, don't kill them!

1267
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:53,078
- Far enough, slave.
- No, kill me! I'm a male virgin.

1268
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:55,664
Marlak, we can't let them
do this! Eema!

1269
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:58,667
Eema. Eema!

1270
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:03,339
- I gotta get down there.
- Over my dead body.

1271
01:20:03,506 --> 01:20:07,426
- No problem.
- No. Hey! Hey! Hey!

1272
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:13,682
- Thanks, Marlak.
- Now what?

1273
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:18,020
We implore the great gods
to show us a sign...

1274
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:20,522
...so that we may honor
your divine will.

1275
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:23,525
Take this end. Lower me down.

1276
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:43,379
Oh, dear.

1277
01:20:43,546 --> 01:20:45,214
Oh, no.

1278
01:21:19,582 --> 01:21:21,208
- What is it?
- It's a sign.

1279
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:26,004
The chosen one comes! It's a sign!
He's going to end our suffering!

1280
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:28,090
Fight the power! Yes, we can!

1281
01:21:34,597 --> 01:21:35,806
All together!

1282
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:42,104
Let's cut some foreskins!

1283
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:46,984
I knew
I could depend upon your loyalty.

1284
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:50,988
Assholes.

1285
01:21:56,786 --> 01:22:00,122
Burn them. Burn them now.
Burn them all!

1286
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,499
Don't struggle,
it's the will of the gods.

1287
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:03,834
I don't think so.

1288
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:05,794
Zed!

1289
01:22:05,962 --> 01:22:07,671
Guards!

1290
01:22:08,631 --> 01:22:10,549
- Sorry!
- Stupid.

1291
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:14,970
Ma'am? Okay? All right?
Get the message?

1292
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:18,056
Okay, we should be safe in here.

1293
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,225
Thank you.

1294
01:22:30,361 --> 01:22:32,654
So, Eema, this might be a bad time
to say this...

1295
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:35,491
...but that stuff
that you saw the other night...

1296
01:22:35,658 --> 01:22:37,910
...with the high priest, that-

1297
01:22:38,077 --> 01:22:41,330
He's a friend.
That was totally not a gay thing.

1298
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,925
I always thought
that you and I had a connection.

1299
01:22:53,092 --> 01:22:54,718
So I just wanted to mention it now.

1300
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:56,970
I always thought that we had
one and maybe...

1301
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:59,223
...thought you might've
felt the same.

1302
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:02,601
I just wanted to maybe bring it up
and see what you would say.

1303
01:23:14,113 --> 01:23:17,449
But I always thought- I always
have felt a certain way about you.

1304
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:19,576
I don't know if you know or not
but you-

1305
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:23,288
All those dead birds
that were always outside of your hut...

1306
01:23:23,456 --> 01:23:25,207
...those were from me.

1307
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:27,543
- Just kiss me.
- From me like a gift for you.

1308
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:30,045
I don't know,
I thought you'd like those.

1309
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,805
I always thought that you could
maybe use the dead birds...

1310
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:41,181
...in a soup or something.

1311
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,725
Or, I don't know,
I thought they were practical.

1312
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,401
Should I take off my undercloth?

1313
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:59,533
Oh, tough guy, huh?
You want a piece of me?

1314
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:02,369
I'm gonna bash your head in.

1315
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:08,417
That was a nice shot.

1316
01:24:12,755 --> 01:24:15,465
Hey.

1317
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,434
Zed!

1318
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:29,438
Get up and die like a man.

1319
01:24:29,897 --> 01:24:32,524
Nobody harm this woman.
She's not a virgin anymore.

1320
01:24:32,692 --> 01:24:36,111
- He's not either.
- I saved her life with my lovemaking.

1321
01:24:37,697 --> 01:24:40,324
Sit tight, mama. Daddy's gotta fight.

1322
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:49,124
Okay. No, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, don't kill him!

1323
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,418
What?

1324
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:53,712
I just had sex with my new girlfriend.

1325
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,839
- So?
- I had to tell somebody. It was great.

1326
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:59,509
I loved it. I'm hoping
I'm gonna get another opportunity.

1327
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:03,263
- What's going on behind you?
- I'm not falling for that.

1328
01:25:05,516 --> 01:25:07,893
Sodomize this!

1329
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:24,409
Hey, Zed!

1330
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:26,620
- Stop! No!
- Get back!

1331
01:25:26,829 --> 01:25:27,829
- Let her go!
- No!

1332
01:25:27,997 --> 01:25:30,165
The gods demand a sacrifice.
You're ruining it!

1333
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:32,584
- How about a little more oil?
- Yes, darling?

1334
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:43,553
I always knew you'd break my heart.

1335
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:46,098
A little hot!

1336
01:25:55,441 --> 01:25:57,192
That was ironic.

1337
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:06,702
So...

1338
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:09,121
...on behalf of the whole city...

1339
01:26:09,288 --> 01:26:12,124
...I'd like to thank the high priest
for his sacrifice.

1340
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:14,710
That was really something,
wasn't it?

1341
01:26:14,877 --> 01:26:17,295
Come on. Put your hands together,
it makes a sound.

1342
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:39,651
The chosen one! The chosen one!
The chosen one! The chosen one!

1343
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:48,243
Okay, that was a little confusing,
wasn't it?

1344
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:51,246
Was that a sign from the gods?

1345
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:53,915
Everybody wants to know.

1346
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:57,753
Well, I should know,
because I'm the chosen one, right?

1347
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,046
Yeah!

1348
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,174
You respect me.

1349
01:27:02,341 --> 01:27:03,842
Yeah!

1350
01:27:04,635 --> 01:27:05,761
You love me.

1351
01:27:05,928 --> 01:27:07,596
Yeah!

1352
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:09,514
You fear me.

1353
01:27:09,682 --> 01:27:11,850
Yeah!

1354
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:13,769
You would worship me.

1355
01:27:13,936 --> 01:27:19,107
Yeah!

1356
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:28,950
Well, don't.

1357
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:31,703
- Yeah!
- No.

1358
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:34,873
And I'm not saying, "Don't" like,
"I'm the chosen one, so don't. "

1359
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:38,293
I'm saying, "Don't"
because I'm not the chosen one.

1360
01:27:39,545 --> 01:27:44,132
I thought I was, but I'm not, sorry.

1361
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,176
Turns out I'm just a guy
from the woods...

1362
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:51,306
...who was lucky enough to have these
great friends to watch my back.

1363
01:27:54,477 --> 01:27:56,520
I'm telling you, you don't need me.

1364
01:27:56,687 --> 01:28:00,398
You know what? Maybe we can all
make our own destiny.

1365
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:03,485
Yeah. Maybe we could all
be chosen.

1366
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:05,320
Yeah.

1367
01:28:05,488 --> 01:28:09,491
- You! You could be chosen!
- Yeah!

1368
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:13,370
- And you! And you!
- Yeah!

1369
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:16,414
Way over in the back! You, little guy!

1370
01:28:18,417 --> 01:28:19,835
Yeah!

1371
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:49,906
- So you're queen.
- Couldn't have done it without you.

1372
01:28:50,074 --> 01:28:51,116
Yeah, you could've.

1373
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:53,326
No, really, I tried for years and...

1374
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:57,873
All right, maybe you couldn't have.
I was pretty amazing with the old-

1375
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,960
Sorry about almost luring you
to your death.

1376
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:04,713
Oh, please.

1377
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,507
All right.

1378
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:11,219
Okay.

1379
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:13,930
See you later.

1380
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:17,684
Come on, people.

1381
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:19,936
- Pick up that bag of camel dung.
- Yes, sir.

1382
01:29:20,104 --> 01:29:21,479
Hang on to it all day.

1383
01:29:21,647 --> 01:29:23,773
Hustle up.
These donkeys don't pack themselves.

1384
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:26,484
- I will kill you where you stand.
- Relax.

1385
01:29:26,652 --> 01:29:30,196
They cut a little off the end but there's
plenty more where that came from.

1386
01:29:30,364 --> 01:29:32,908
This is my woman.
Stay away from her, or I'll kill you.

1387
01:29:33,075 --> 01:29:35,076
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
- Just go.

1388
01:29:35,244 --> 01:29:36,828
Get out of here or I'll kill you.

1389
01:29:36,996 --> 01:29:38,580
Cranky today.

1390
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:41,958
So are you still thinking
about going to Egypt?

1391
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:45,086
Supposed to be a real happening
place. You coming with or not?

1392
01:29:45,254 --> 01:29:49,591
Well, I mean, I was kind of
planning on going anyway, so...

1393
01:29:52,845 --> 01:29:55,263
Let me show you this new style.
Everyone's doing it.

1394
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:58,683
You open your mouth really wide.
It makes it way sexier.

1395
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:06,149
I'm thinking about introducing the
tongue, but I haven't perfected it yet.

1396
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:08,944
- You know, we'll work on that.
- All right.

1397
01:30:12,406 --> 01:30:15,158
Look at us. Two men.

1398
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:18,536
One going to lead a village and
the other going to explore the world.

1399
01:30:18,704 --> 01:30:20,789
You sure you don't wanna come back,
help me?

1400
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:24,668
You don't need me. Everybody knows
you're the smartest guy in the village.

1401
01:30:24,835 --> 01:30:28,004
Gonna know you're the most
incredible warrior anyone's ever seen.

1402
01:30:28,172 --> 01:30:31,466
The way you punched that lady? Man!

1403
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:32,676
I mean, you know...

1404
01:30:32,843 --> 01:30:36,388
She left me no choice, so I had to,
you know, punch her in the face.

1405
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:40,809
Well, we'll tell stories about you
around the fire.

1406
01:30:41,477 --> 01:30:44,646
Strangers shake hands.
Get that thing out of here.

1407
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,153
- I'm gonna miss you, little guy.
- I'm gonna miss you more.

1408
01:30:52,655 --> 01:30:55,532
Just trying to sniff you.
I wanna remember your scent.

1409
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:58,660
That's probably the urine in my hair.

1410
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:05,333
I can't let them see me cry.
They respect me too much.

1411
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:10,088
Me too. On three.
One, two, three, break.

1412
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:15,593
Well, may the gods smile on you.
See you around.

1413
01:31:15,761 --> 01:31:17,637
Whatever. Later.

1414
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,472
- Oh?
- What?

1415
01:31:21,892 --> 01:31:24,310
I want you to have babies
with my sister.

1416
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:29,149
- Try and stop me.
- All right, man.

1417
01:31:29,316 --> 01:31:33,361
- Zed, may the gods smile on you.
- You said that.

1418
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:35,447
- May they. Yeah.
- Thank you, though.

1419
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:40,618
All right come on, folks. We're heading
out now because I say so, all right?

1420
01:31:40,786 --> 01:31:44,330
What's the deal? Come on, Lindsey.
Come on, everyone's looking.

1421
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:47,751
Please. Go. Good.

1422
01:31:47,918 --> 01:31:49,919
To the north!

1423
01:31:51,797 --> 01:31:53,590
You know that that's west.

1424
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:55,717
I was just checking to see
if you knew.

1425
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:57,802
To the west!

1426
01:31:58,387 --> 01:32:00,638
I'm already glad you're here.

1427
01:32:20,951 --> 01:32:23,828
One, two, three, foreskin!

1428
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:27,248
Invoke your blessing
and do your will.

1429
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:29,793
What's the fucking line? What is it?

1430
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,836
It was a game.
It was a game of chance...

1431
01:32:32,004 --> 01:32:34,339
...and he hit his head
and he killed himself.

1432
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:37,592
If anything, it was a suicide.
Okay.

1433
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,761
I let one go.

1434
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:47,143
In honor of the chosen one,
as my first official act as your queen...

1435
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:49,437
...I'm going to go back
and say the line again.

1436
01:32:49,605 --> 01:32:52,982
- Let's go back. Do you wanna try it?
- Yeah.

1437
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,442
You just want it all.

1438
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:57,278
You want to taste it all
and know it all and feel it all.

1439
01:32:57,446 --> 01:33:00,448
And suck it all in and blow it all out
your backside, don't you?

1440
01:33:00,616 --> 01:33:02,283
Sorry.

1441
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:09,207
It's like the Great Turtle coming out
of the sea, you know?

1442
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:12,961
It's like with the earth on its back,
you understand?

1443
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:15,338
I'm an oilman.

1444
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:20,135
You're cursed, Zed, and if you don't
leave here we're all gonna be cursed.

1445
01:33:20,302 --> 01:33:23,680
And it drank up the ocean,
then pooped out the mountains...

1446
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:26,474
...and the first man
fell from the stars.

1447
01:33:26,642 --> 01:33:29,978
This is- I don't- This doesn't make
a lot of sense, guys.

1448
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:32,147
Can I talk to Harold?
Is that-?

1449
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:50,832
What's that?

1450
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,003
What's that?
A strange Gorgon from another time!

1451
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:58,756
I weep for the suffering
of my people.

1452
01:33:59,758 --> 01:34:00,842
We're getting boned...

1453
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:03,344
...by the planes, the trains,
and the what, huh?

1454
01:34:03,512 --> 01:34:04,512
Zed?

1455
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,515
- Oh, that's great.
- Zed? It's constricting me.

1456
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:10,810
Can I show you this new kiss
I been thinking about?

1457
01:34:10,978 --> 01:34:14,189
- Yeah.
- It's called a tongue kiss.

1458
01:34:18,485 --> 01:34:21,654
- It's strange. Yeah. Okay.
- Still perfecting it, yeah.

1459
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:24,157
- It's fine.
- All right.

1460
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:25,950
What?

1461
01:34:34,376 --> 01:34:36,711
And camera reloading!
