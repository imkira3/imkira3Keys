00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,789
-Get off.

So I suggest you pay up

36
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:17,243
If y'aII think C KiIIuh took it home

37
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,877
The jury has spoken.

So this is gonna be

The winner tonight

He knocked the Rock Star off
his pedestaI and took him to schooI.

42
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,243

47
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,495
I was gonna use that money

00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:33,145
Now, winning teams
wiII receive fuII schoIarships...

152
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,749
...for each team member.

153
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,821
-AII right!
-That sound good?

154
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,014
Yeah!

155
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:44,060
It gives me great pIeasure to introduce
our new brothers from Theta Nu Theta.

156
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,428
Y'all got to keep up
To keep up

157
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,431
This time we take
the show on the road

158
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,797
That's what Theta came to do

159
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,997
Somebody told you that you can
go by the easy road

160
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,268
-Let's go.
-Nobody told me, nobody told me

161
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,538
But / got, got, got to get to Thetaland

162
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:05,081
Because the road to Thetaland
is long, rough and rugged

163
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:09,449
-/t takes a hell of man to make it
-HoId tight in position, come on.

164
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,749
-I can't hear you.
-Ty. Right here.

165
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,955
-Come on.
-AII right, Bryce!

166
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:19,857
Get yourself off the road
because Theta came through

167
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,294
Yeah!

168
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,360
HoId it tight, yo.

169
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,195
About-face.

170
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,238
-Come on, tighten up.
-AII right, Bryce!

171
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,469
Thetas, reveaI yourseIves.

172
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,811
-Theta greeting.
-Theta greeting!

173
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,322
Please be advised Theta Nu
came to serve you our best, sir

174
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,552
Who wants to come and get down?

175
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,259
All the way down.

176
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,287
Who wants to be served?

177
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,796
What? What? What?

178
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,459
No protection from the truth
Peace be with us

179
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,633
How may we serve you?

180
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,465
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

181
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,338
This work's making me hungry.

182
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,946
I think I want a Coke, a Big Mac
and a what?

183
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,316
SmaII Fry!

00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,115
-Get it.
-Yeah!

185
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,348

00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,819

TaIk to them.

00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,659
PAC-MAN.

189
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,860
Running after these Iadies
as fast as I can.

190
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,238
You supposed to be Theta?

191
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,148
Oh, yeah.

192

-Yeah, Ty!

00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:58,987

Y'aII see this? Y'aII see it?

201
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,368

210
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,237
It's the new brothers
of Theta Nu Theta.

211
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,430
Yes, honey!

212
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,514
-Get out of here!

213
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,548
Yo, bro.

Mu.

215
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,359
-Oh, get out of here!
-Mu.

216
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,428
Come on, man.

217
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,554
Mu.

218
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,196
Mu.

219
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:20,438
Mu Gamma Xi.

220
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:25,982
Mu Gamma Xi.

221
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,829
Mu.

222
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,433
Mu Gamma Xi.
Mu Gamma Xi.

223
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:47,595
We are the outstanding brothers
of Mu Gamma Xi.

224
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:51,573
We rep where we go
till the day that we die.

225
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,980
Get off my back.
Get off my back.

226
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,283
Mu Gamma.

227
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,417
Mu Gamma, Mu, Mu, Mu.

228

Yo, Craig.

229

Mu Gamma Xi.
Mu Gamma Xi.

230
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,442
You must think you're Superman,
thinking you can come upstage us.

231
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,680
This is how you wanna
start the weekend?

232
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,552
-CouIdn't wait tiII Sunday, Taz?
-That's how I feeI.

233
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,887
Face it, Dane, you're gonna Iose.

234
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,053
You're gonna Iose huge.

235
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,357
Yeah. It's been two years.

236
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,798
When you graduate, they're
gonna remember you as a faiIure.

237
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,336
Yo, Taz. Taz.

238
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,633

241
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,477
That's your new mascot, right?
Is that who that is?

242
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,049
Oh, the Rock Star, huh?

243
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,180
We've heard him speak.
He do other tricks?

244
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,720
Yo, I got your trick. You want--?

245
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,050
You need to caIm down.

246
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,852
-CaIm down.
-Oh, he gets mad.

247
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,858
You need to be cooI.

248
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,325
Steady, steady. Y'aII be cooI.

249
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,556
-ReIax.
-No, be cooI.

250
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,859
-Ease up.
-He gets mad, huh?

251
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,366
-There we go.
-Be cooI.

252
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,998
-M-U!
-Gamma Xi!

253
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,502
-M-U!
-Gamma Xi!

254
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,038
-M-U!
-Gamma Xi!

255
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:37,282
Come on, man.

256
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,250
Come on, man.

257
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,874
Theta what?
Theta Nu.

258
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,720
I Iove this!

259
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,917
Show-stopping.

260
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,622
I can't wait to win
one of these bad boys on Sunday.

261
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,093
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.
Put this thing down.

262
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,932
We gonna have one
soon enough, kid.

263
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,796
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Soon enough.

264
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,631
-Yo, I'm not so sure.
-What?

265
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,638
There's a reason
why we haven't won one since then.

266
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,070
Mus were better tonight.

267
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,404
I mean,
they had some hot moves, man.

268
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,944
They did.

269
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,908
If we don't step our game up,
we're gonna get destroyed on Sunday.

270
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,116
We can say goodbye
to the schoIarship and the money.

271
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,518
Don't know about y'aII,
but I couId use it.

272
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,683
Tuition is crazy, but no way we're
gonna get Dane to change the routine.

273
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,753
But why not?

274
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,798
Why not? I mean, think about it.

275
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:05,027
Theta's been doing the same routine
since before I Ieft Truth Iast year.

276
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,935
-I can come up with something better.
-ReaIIy, Chance? ReaIIy?

277
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,871
We just got the frat. We just got in--

278
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,812
Hey, Roy, what's going on, man?

279
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,982
We just got into the frat.
You wanna rock the boat?

280
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,485
Come on, man, that's not a good Iook.
It's not. It's not.

281
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,614
One thing's for sure, we're gonna Iose
if you keep stepping on my feet.

282
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,124
Man, forget aII of that.

283
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,421
TeII Nikki to hook us up
with her sorors.

284
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,464
-Pass the baII. Pass the baII.
-No. I'II be right back.

285
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,658
-Come on, stop being greedy.
-Jeez.

286
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,560
Theta what?

287
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,864
-Theta Nu.
-Theta Nu.

288
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,238
-What's up, baby?
-Come here, baby.

289
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,839
I can't stick around...

290
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,811
...because I gotta check on the fIoats
for homecoming.

291
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:55,647
But I wanted to say congratuIations.
You were amazing.

292
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,345
WeII, I do what I can do.

293
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,389
AII right, aII right,
don't get aII gassed.

294
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,296
I'II see you Iater, right?

295
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,959
Of course.

296
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,229
Okay.

297
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,271
-Let's go.
-AII right.

298
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,609
Hey, can I taIk to you for a second?

299
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,142
What's up?

300
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,281
What happened at the pep raIIy earIier
was unacceptabIe.

301
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,823
And I think you know that.

302
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,894
I wasn't gonna stand back
and watch Taz disrespect us.

303
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,794
But what you did was disrespectfuI
to me and to the frat.

304
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,698
Look, Chance, you're a Theta now,
and we expect a Iot more from you.

305
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,635
BeIieve me, nobody wants
to outdo Taz more than I do.

306
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,800
You Iet me handIe him. Understand?

307
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,938
My man.

308
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,573
-Fellas, keep form.
-All right.

309
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,592
I wanna hear it. I wanna hear it.

310
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,758
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

311
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,265
That's aII you got?

312
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,227
-I'm trying.
-Not trying hard enough.

313
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:24,136
We have untiI Sunday, you guys,
to get that routine together. Okay?

314
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,338
Or we're gonna Iose.
Is that what you want?

315
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,447
-We're gonna Iose anyway.
-I'm sorry, you say something?

316
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,310
I didn't hear you.

317
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:36,682
You got something to say?
Do you have something to say, neo?

318
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:41,287
-The Mus were dope the other night.
-I don't give a damn about the Mus.

319
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,361
If you have a point, damn it,
you better make it.

320
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,857
Look, a few of us was thinking
that maybe...

321
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,266
...we shouId step our game up
a IittIe bit.

322
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,669
-We doing the stuff from Iast year.
-So now what?

323
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,676
-Maybe I shouId just show you.
-Yeah, maybe you shouId.

324
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,053
Dane. Dane,
we don't got time for this, man.

325
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,452
No, no, be cooI, boy.

326
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,560
Let the boy have the fIoor.
Let's see what he's made of.

327
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,759
AII right.

328
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,070
We couId stiII incorporate
the same moves from our Iast routine...

329
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,637
...but it doesn't hurt
to have a ace up our sIeeves.

330
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,354
For those of you who wanna
incorporate Chance's choreography...

331
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,924
...into the routine, raise your hands.

332
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,664
Looks Iike you guys
better get started.

333
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,697
-Yeah, thank you. AII right.
-Oh, yeah.

334
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,204
You gonna put our fate
in the hands of a neo?

335
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,467
I'II be damned if I Iet Taz win this.

336
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,769
Maybe he can give us the edge
that we need.

337
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,642
That's aII I'm saying.

338
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,612
I hope you're right.

339
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,183
Yes, yes, yes.

340
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,684
Show me what you got there, man.
That's it.

341
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:53,052
I didn't caII a break.
You got a routine, you better show it.

342
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,489
-AII right.
-So Iet's go, Iet's go.

343
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,396
-Morning, Terry.
-Hey, Shorty.

344
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,141
-Chance in yet?
-Course not.

345
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:19,611
One more time. Wynn, stay with me.
Remember that right Ieg.

346
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:25,320
AII right, y'aII, one more time.
DaredeviI, I see you. Right Ieg.

347
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,286
-One more time. AII right, come on.
-No, no, no.

348
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,987
That's enough, that's enough.

349
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,664
Yo, so good job.

350
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:41,672
I admit it stiII needs a IittIe bit of work.
Don't think this gets you off the hook.

351
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,206
StiII have community service
this afternoon.

352
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,968
On homecoming weekend?
Come on.

353
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,612
-Thought it was aII about stepping?
-And girIs.

354
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,112
Learn to step,
get as many girIs as you want.

355
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,615
Come on, Iet's go. I'II see y'aII Iater.

356
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,914
-Yo, what time is it?
-It's 1 1 :00.

357
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,921
Damn. I gotta go.

358
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,186
-Good morning, come on in.
-Good morning.

359
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,420
Janice. AII right.

360
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,827
Nice to see you. Good morning.

361
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,991
Come in. I don't even wanna hear it.
Come on. Get ready.

362
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:14,332
Dad, practice ran over. I'm sorry.

363
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:18,067
-Dad, I said I was sorry.
-Look, Chance, I don't wanna hear it.

364
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,179
I aIready toId you how important this
weekend is, didn't I? Just get ready.

365
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,520
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

366
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,826
You guys enjoy.

367
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:04,177
Chance, my office, now.

368
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,422
Sit down.

369
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,198
Look...

370
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,465
...you didn't re-enroII in Truth
just to sIack off.

371
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,072
SIack off?

372
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,467
I'm here every day
trying to heIp you out.

373
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:31,110
I'm entering the show
so I can win schoIarship money.

374
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,149
That frat is not a priority.

375
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,446
Look...

376
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,491
...when your mom died...

377
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,720
...you ran out of here
with no money and no pIan.

378
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,955
You Ieft me
to handIe this restaurant.

379
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,995
Now that you're back home, I wanna
see you take some responsibiIity...

380
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,137
...to see this thing through.

381
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,534
I'm not trying to run your Iife.

382
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,232
I've aIways tried
to be supportive of you.

383
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,138
Now I need you
to be supportive of me.

384
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,196
-Pi.
-Delta.

385
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,929
Pi Delta Mu step.

386
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,930
I gotta admit, man, your girI
is getting it in right now, Chance.

387
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,802
She Iooking kind of fIy too.

388
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,103
AII these fIy honeys here,
and you gotta check out my girI.

389
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,476
What's the matter, man?
You worried about aII this big Wynn?

390
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,709
Don't do that. And I'm good.
I ain't worried about nothing.

391
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,213
-Come on.
-Maybe you shouId, dude.

392
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,320
-Homewrecker, 7 o'cIock.
-Hi.

393
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,986
Man, you better run.

394
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:54,154
We are the Pi DeIta Mus, and not onIy
are we smart and beautifuI...

395
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,692
...we aIso know
how to get down and dirty.

396
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:01,202
My girIs are about to show you
something y'aII need to see.

397
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,466
-Pi Delta Mu step.
-Chance.

398
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,577
Pi Delta Mu step.

399
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,147
Pi Delta Mu step.

400
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,113
Aren't you happy to see me?

401
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,878
Slow it down.

402
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,652
Come on.

403
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,586
-Get it, girIs.
-She's cuter than Iast year.

404
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,421
-Is it serious?
-What do you want, Brenda?

405
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:30,926
I don't know.

406
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,902
You're just kind of on my mind.
I never got a chance to expIain myseIf.

407
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:38,338
Hey, hey, hey.

408
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,676
It's been a year.

409
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,408
Why now?

410
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,381
Because it's not the same
without you.

411
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,585
I kind of miss you and me.

412
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,680
You know...

413
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,525
...me and you did have
some good times.

414
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:05,799
Wasn't aII easy saiIing.

415
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,866
You see,
when I needed you the most...

416
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,640
...you wasn't even there.

417
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:17,447
Too busy hooking up with Taz
to notice.

418
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,284
I deserve that. I do.

419
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,220
But when your mom died,
you shut me out.

420
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,918
And then you transferred schooIs
in FIorida.

421
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,786
What was I supposed to do?

422
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,798
You know,
you're a reaI piece of work.

423
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,492
Everybody makes mistakes,
Chance.

424
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,666
Same number, right?

425
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,316
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

426
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,781
-Did you see us?
-You guys did good.

427
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:55,977
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

428
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,519
-How good?
-ReaI good.

429
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,554
-Proud?
-ReaI proud. Let's go, baby.

430
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,157
Okay.

431
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,862
CouId you just drop me
at the stadium?

432
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,224
I gotta check on some stuff
for the game.

433
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,094
Of course.
I was on the way to Ashby anyway.

434
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,826
Ashby? For what?

435
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,029
I got a IittIe community-service gig.

436
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,273
AII the neos have to do it.

437
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,140
Look at you, getting invoIved.

438
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,781
I thought you were too cooI for that.

439
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:42,989
Chance.

440
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,369
Yo, man, watch it.

441
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,971
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

442
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,510
-Nothing? You aImost ran a stop sign.
-Look, reIax, okay?

443
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,239
I'm just a IittIe nervous, baby.
That's it.

444
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,140
Okay?

445
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:05,021
Now, Iet's get out of here.
If I'm Iate, I have to hear from Dane.

446
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,865
I must say, man, the way you got
at Dane this morning...

447
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,092
...that was kind of gangster, man.

448
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,600
Now you're just gonna have to
foIIow through.

449
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:24,405
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You got Dane to change the routine.

450
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,770
That's big. Just think about it.

451
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,711
If we win on Sunday,
oh, we be Iiving Iegends, man.

452
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,920
WeII, weII...

453
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,091
...if it isn't the Thetas' new mascot
and his sidekick, OId YeIIer.

454
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,895
I know you ain't taIking
with aII that possum around your neck.

455
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,800
You know what?
Your jokes couId use an upgrade.

456
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,440
They're getting kind of oId.

457
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,905
Yeah, kind of Iike them dance steps
you do.

458
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,979
You spit a good game at the raIIy,

459
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,906
Last night was just a taste
of what I'm bringing.

460
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,842

463
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,783
Trophy on one arm
and your girI on the next.

464
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:20,964
Because she'II reaIize you're a sucker,

465
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,396
It sucks, but these things happen,

466
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,230
-You see that?
-Yeah.

00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,563

469
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:35,478
-It ain't worth it.
-That sucks. It does. Sucks.

470
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,647
Now we gonna get back to work.

471
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,613
You feIIas have a good day.

472

00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,849
We got some bumping and grinding
going on down there.

481
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,988
Somebody is trying to get
some homecoming nookie.

482
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,417
What are you doing?

483
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,526
Come on, man.

484
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,867

00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,903
You had a Iot of mouth earIier.

486
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,569
Ready to back up that trash

487
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,716
Yo, yo, yo, you guys

488
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,876
Oh, my bad. I mean,
he was just bragging pretty hard.

489
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,682
I just figured he might need a chance
to warm up.

490
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,848
-Is that right?
-Yeah, that's right.

491
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,360
We got nothing to prove.
We good here.

492
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,725
-Come on, Iet's get a drink.
-Yeah, I figured as much, man.

493
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:37,595
But, you know, whenever you're ready
to Iet the dog off the Ieash....

494
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,233
-I think I'm ready now.

495
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,874
-No, no, no. Let's go.
-Yeah.

496
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,634
You're gonna do this now?

497
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,008
HoId up. I'm seeing

498
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,649

499
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,657
Keep it peacefuI.

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,872
-I mean, come on.
-Man.

506
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,345
Give me my hat.

507
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,381

508
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,345
-Don't Iook over here.
-Sorry, my bad.

509
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:44,385
Chance, what are you trying to prove?
God, you are kiIIing me.

510
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,688
Check it out.

511
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,854
We aII have to be on that stage
Sunday.

512
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,761
Take your revenge out there.

513
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,400
Get in the car.

514
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,919
I Ieft my sweater inside.

515
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:13,056
Honey, did you see

516
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,022
-This day, I can't even deaI.
-ReaIIy.

517
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,128
Why you didn't teII me

518
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,956
I need serious tweezing.

519
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,193
-It's Wynn.
-Serious tweezing, honey.

520
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,936
Look your phone ain't here, aII right?
What was your deaI earIier, man?

521
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,407
It'd be nice if you'd think of the frat...

522
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:37,376
...before you show
how to make us aII Iook crazy.

523
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:47,347
-Honey, what is it?
-Text from Brenda.

524
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:48,753
Oh, heII, no, Nikki.

525
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:52,487
-Like, for reaI, caII her right now.
-Rena, I'm not gonna caII her.

526
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:59,294
-One more time.
-Your phone is not here.

527
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,236
-And I promise this is it.
-Yo, your girI's outside.

528
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,944
You found my phone.

529
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:16,575
That's why you my--

530
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,985
What's wrong?

531
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,190
Who were you tonight?

532
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:29,455
-Because it's not the Chance I know.
-Look, I know. And I'm sorry.

533
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:35,832
I guess it's true what they say.
You never reaIIy know a person, huh?

534
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:41,236
I mean, baby,
it's reaIIy not that serious, okay? I--

535
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,381
Chance, you toId me
you were over Brenda.

536
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,655
Look, how many times
do I have to teII you?

537
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,155
I'm not thinking about that girI.
I want nothing to do with her.

538
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,318
I saw the texts, Chance.

539
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,696
You're saying
you went through my phone?

540
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,467
-You Iied to me.
-I didn't Iie to you.

541
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,873
Brenda pushed up on me.
And I toId her--

542
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:18,173
ToId her what, Chance?
You toId her no?

543
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,541
Or maybe?

544
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,213
Know what?

545
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,821
-Maybe I'm not good enough for you.
-Don't--

546
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,326
No, no, no. Because ever since
day one, you never trusted me.

547
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,963
Don't you dare.

548
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,692
Don't you dare turn this around on me,
because this is about you.

549
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,735
Your inabiIity to make a decision
about what you want.

550
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:45,433
You're the new hot thing on campus
and everybody wants a piece, right?

551
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:50,844
WeII, I refuse to pIay second fiddIe
to any girI.

552
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,344
I'm sorry.

553
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:04,219
Look, I don't know what eIse to say.

554
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,230
-HeIIo?
-You busy?

555
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,334
No. Why?

556
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,571
I was thinking

557
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,998
/n person.

558
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,140
-Where's Taz?
-Where's Nikki?

559
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,314
/'m outside.

560
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,683
Don't you ever wonder
what that wouId be Iike?

561
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,350
If you hadn't Ieft?

562
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,294
It's a party, y'aII.

563
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,958
Not me.

564
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,170
What's up, pIayboy?

565
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,205
Let me hoIIer at you for a minute.

566
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,004
-Yeah, what's up?
-I was Iooking for Chance.

567
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,675
He's not here.

568
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,647
You think I'm pIaying with you,
partner?

569
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:48,459
WeII, this here be Theta property.

570
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,127
I said,

571
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,667

What's the matter?

584
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,767
I can't do this.

585
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:04,032
-This ain't right.
-You know what?

586
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,337
You can...

587
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,842
...because it is right...

588
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,947

What happened?
Yo, Wynn, you okay?

599
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,309
Yeah, I'm aII right.

600
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:44,174
I'm on my way to the hospitaI now.
I sure hope that doctor's cute.

601
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,680
These guys came to the house
Iooking for you.

602
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,148
You have any idea who they were?

603
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,149
How the heII wouId I know?
I wasn't here.

604
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,352
ReaIIy? Because they came
asking for you by name.

605
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,889
Why the heII wouId somebody
wanna come after you?

606
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,558
Man, I don't know.
But it couId've been anybody.

607
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:09,001
-ProbabIy one of Taz's boys.
-These cats were straight hood.

608
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,441
-Straight up.
-Yeah.

609
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:18,747
Yeah, he Iied about it, but I kind
of think you overreacted a IittIe bit.

610
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:22,782
You know Brenda. I honestIy think
she's just chasing after him.

611
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:26,116
-WeII, he's not running.
-That don't mean he did anything.

612
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,157
Come on. You seen her
at that party the other night.

613
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:32,989
She was jocking him kind of hard.
And I'm Ietting you know now...

614
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,791
...it ain't the first time
and won't be the Iast.

615
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,332
Why'd he Iie
if he wasn't doing anything wrong?

616
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:43,303
Because he's a man, sweet cakes.
That's just what men do.

617
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,670
AII right, Iook.

618
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,236
Give it some time...

619
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:52,610
...see how the weekend goes,
and he'II come around.

620
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,420
I trust you.

621
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,351
Cheers.

622
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,894
Yo, Rock Star.

623
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,772
-AII right?
-Yeah, fine.

624
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,271
You shouId see him, though,
you know?

625
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,342
What's up?

626
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:25,844
Have to teII you something.

627
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:31,412
CoupIe of weeks ago,
I got hustIed at a dance battIe.

628
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,419
Now they're gunning for me.

629
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:42,225
Are you trying to teII me that this...

630
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,935
...is because of you?

631
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,135
So why didn't you say anything?

632
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,835
I don't know.

633
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:59,949
I guess-- I guess I was scared
to get kicked off the team.

634
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:03,811
I reaIIy, reaIIy needed to win
this competition.

635
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,388
Are you serious?
That's what you're worried about?

636
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:12,258
I mean, you've aIways been
kind of seIfish, but this is ridicuIous.

637
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,631
Something about you changed.

638
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:18,097
My whoIe Iife has changed.
Ever since my mom died, I--

639
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,566
Don't put this on your mother.

640
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,729
Don't.

641
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:28,638
Everything has aIways been
about Chance Harris.

642
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,280
And it's been that way
since we were IittIe.

643
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,849
I'm your boy, Chance.

644
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,982
You shouId've come to me.

645
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,494
-Hey.
-Hey, girI.

646
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:02,400
So I heard there was, Iike, a huge fight
at the Theta house Iast night.

647
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:11,513
The IittIe dude you was dancing with
at the cIub Iast night, where he at?

648
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,879
Do I know you?

649
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:19,912
I reaIIy thought you coIIege boys
was a IittIe bit smarter than that.

650
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:25,059
-Answer the damn question.
-What you want with him?

651
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,391
-Anybody hurt?
-Wynn got himseIf beat up.

652
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,759
It reaIIy ain't none of your business.

653
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,597
But Iet's just say he owe me.

654
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:41,576
-What about Chance?
-I don't know.

655
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,806
You Iike catfish?

656
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,947
What are you doing here?

657
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:57,560
I thought you shouId be home
resting up.

658
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:02,325
And miss my first game as a Theta?
Come on, man.

659
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:09,503
I thought it'd be nice
if my best homey wouId roII with me.

660
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,639
PIus it's hard
for a handicapped brother.

661
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,145
I couIdn't get one honey.

662
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:22,183
Just one honey
to just heIp your boy out, I swear.

663
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,753
-StiII ain't got that boy Iaid yet?
-Oh, reaIIy, Shorty? ReaIIy?

664
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,447
That's what we're doing?
It's not that simpIe.

665
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,374
Don't ruin your homecoming weekend
pining over some guy.

666
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,777
-It screams desperation.
-You're the one that has me worried.

667
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,849
You toId me
something happened to him.

668
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:57,179
Don't worry about Chance. He's fine.

669
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,447
-Excuse me?
-He's fine.

670
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:03,081
It's a good thing he wasn't at
the house when the fight went down.

671
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,286
-And how do you know that?
-Because he was with me.

672
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:19,098
Why you Iet that girI get to you? She
get her Iife making peopIe miserabIe.

673
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,744
-She's doing a good job.
-That's not the point.

674
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,540
Damn, man,
you came kind of deep this year.

675
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:25,840
Ladies.

676
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,007
Man, Iook,

677
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,380
I couId use some heIp.
This is not cooI.

678
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:33,455
Hey. Nikki, baby.

679
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,853
-I wanna taIk to you.
-No. Don't ''baby'' me.

680
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:39,860
CongratuIations,
you finaIIy made a choice.

681
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:45,258
Nikki. Nikki!

682
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,366
Can I heIp you?

683
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,509
-We're Iooking for Chance.
-What you want with him?

684
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:58,606
-Go back and see if he in the back.
-Y'aII can't go there.

685
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,615
-Move, Iady.
-He's not here.

686
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,720
-I'm gonna have to ask y'aII to Ieave.
-He's not here.

687
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:13,052
This pIace is fiIthy.
I think you guys shouId cIean it up.

688
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,606
-Yo, what's going on here?
-Chance.

689
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:30,644
You aII right? Go outside. Go outside.
Yo, you came after my peopIe, dawg.

690
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,147
-That shit wasn't necessary.
-ActuaIIy, I came for you.

691
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:38,418
-Where's my money, Chance?
-Look, I don't owe you no money.

692
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,488
I toId you that. You know this.

693
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,856
You pIayed in the streets.

694
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:47,053
You made the bet.

695
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,923
So either you have my money...

696
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:52,759
...or you don't.

697
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,897
Hey, hey, hey! AII right, aII right.

698
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:59,268

699
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,171

700
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,802
-Think that's good enough?
-Just give me tiII Sunday.

701
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:08,441
Now, hoId on, hoId on, hoId on.
Let him go.

702
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,954
So Iet me ask you a question.

703
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,825
What makes you think you can win?

704
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,459
Look, just trust me, I got this.

705
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:25,163
Word on campus
is the Mus are gonna win.

706
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,762
That's who I got my money on.

707
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,839
Is y'aII betting on a stepping?

708
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,999
But now you're taIking
about messing aII that up.

709
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:39,213
Tomorrow the Thetas better Iose.

710
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,180
You don't have a choice, fish boy.

711
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,114
Let's go.

712
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,942
-Are you aII right, Chance?
-I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm good.

713
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,848
What happened?
My pIace is ruined.

714
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,682
-/'m gonna fix this.
-Fix what?

715
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,380
-/ got into trouble.
-Trouble?

716
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:24,755
-Dance battIe. These guys hustIed me.
-You know these peopIe?

717
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,395
-Yes.
-What did you get into?

718
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,554
-TroubIe.
-You have to do with this?

719
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,256
Yes. I'm trying to teII you--

720
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,095
-What are you trying to teII me?
-You never Iisten.

721
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,501
That's why I don't come to you.
I said I'II fix it, I'm gonna.

722
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:37,833
You're gonna fix what?

723
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,943
What are you gonna fix, Chance?
What are you gonna fix?

724
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:46,676

-Man, working, man.

00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,000
StruggIing, striving, grinding.

732
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,764
-You know, you know.
-Oh, yeah.

733
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,100

00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,042
-What's up?
-What you doing here?

736
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:22,548

737
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,687
Come on,

738

-You too?
-Me too.

740
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,123
SeriousIy, man,
I'm excited to see you on Sunday.

741
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:39,325
My man Chance, he heIped us freak
the routine for Sunday's competition.

742
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,970
-Gonna be hot.
-That's what I Iike to hear.

743
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:46,601
ActuaIIy, that's what I wanna taIk
to you guys about.

744
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,136
Yo, what you taIking about?

745
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:58,845
A few weeks ago, I got hustIed
at a dance battIe, 5 grand.

746
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,488
So everything that happened Iast night
was because of me.

747
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:09,996
They're gonna come after me
if I don't throw the competition.

748
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:15,302
Look, I never meant to get you guys
invoIved in this mess, and I'm sorry.

749
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,471
EspeciaIIy to you, Wynn.

750
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:23,042
And you never thought
to say something before?

751
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,273
-Maybe we couId've done something.
-Like what?

752
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:30,044
Pay them off? Fight them?
No, I'm good.

753
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,182
-HandIe it myseIf.
-You don't have that choice, Chance.

754
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:38,525
Wynn is hurt, and we're supposed
to go out and Iose to save your ass?

755
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:41,289
No. I never intended
on throwing the competition.

756
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:44,399
I understand how important
this competition is to you.

757
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,899
Chance, it's not about me.

758
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:48,734
It's about the team.

759
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,408
I can see how much damage
I've caused here.

760
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,979
I've done more harm than good.

761
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:09,353
-Maybe I shouId just quit.
-We don't need him. Never did.

762
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:12,495
Listen, we changed the entire routine
because of you.

763
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,653
There's no way
you can do this to us.

764
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,890
Dane, teII him
he doesn't have to Ieave.

765
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,624
I got it.

766
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,363
Rock Star, hoId up.

767
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:29,470
Now, emotions are cIearIy high
right now.

768
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:35,715
So I gotta Iet the brother
do what he's gotta do, period.

769
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,118
It's another day.

770
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,783
And y'aII are stiII famiIy.

771
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:45,958
That's what matters.

772
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:51,358
-Theta what?
-Theta Nu.

773
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:52,762
There it is.

774
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,061
Keep your head up, brother.
AII right, y'aII.

775
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,230
-DJ, be good, man.
-Peace out.

776
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,375
-Yo.
-AII right.

777
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:41,147
Figured I'd find you here.

778
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:46,115
I caught Wynn and Dane
on their way to practice.

779
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:47,756
They toId me everything.

780
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:51,284
I came to see if you were okay.

781
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,488
I'm good.

782
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:02,803
WeII, why aren't you at practice?

783
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,041
Because I just can't do
the competition right now.

784
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:11,846
What you mean
is you don't want to do this right now.

785
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,449
I reaIIy do care about you.

786
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,652
And I'm not the onIy one.

787
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,288
But that doesn't seem
to mean anything to you.

788
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:24,222
-Come on, Nikki. That's not even fair.
-Not fair is turning your back...

789
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:28,854
-...on peopIe that beIieved in you.
-I don't wanna Iose you, okay?

790
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,831
-I don't wanna Iose you.
-Then don't.

791
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:54,346
Come on, y'aII,
check up, check up, check up.

792
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:06,467
Now, I know a Iot has happened
in the Iast coupIe days.

793
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:09,605
We can't worry about that now.
We worry about who's here.

794
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,708
Don't worry about who's not. Who's on
this roof, that's what's important.

795
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,409
I'm gonna teII you right now,
this competition stiII matters.

796
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,708
Now, I'm hard on you guys
because I want you to be the best.

797
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:22,350
I need you guys to focus.

798
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:25,749
I'm taIking about razor-bIade-precision
focus, you understand?

799
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:29,289
We Thetas. So Iet's get it.
Roy, take us home.

800
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,418
Yeah.

801
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,858
Gonna make you proud, man.
Make you proud.

802
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:36,529
Let's go. Do it.

803
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:41,066
I Iike what I'm seeing, dawgs.

804
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:44,532
Top row, Iet that beast out, Iet's go.

805
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,775
Yeah. I want it in the bag.

806
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:54,581
We are the heart of the party, TN T.

807
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:57,845
Smashing all you brothers
with a beat.

808
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:04,659
Okay.

809
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,446
What up, Atlanta?
Your boy DJ Will Power here...

810
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,115
...where we keep you
popping and locking.

811
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:40,524
Step-off Sunday is finally here.
We've been talking about it.

812
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,857
We've been waiting.

813
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:46,297
Truth University, you are the host
of the Sprite Step Off Championship.

814
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,699
Teams come
from all over this country...

815
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,305
...to be crowned
the national step champion...

816
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:54,807
...and to win thousands of dollars

817
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,842
Better have brought their A game.

818
01:01:57,013 --> 01:02:00,005
This homecoming, Truth,
will be one to remember.

819
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:04,618
-Hey.
-Hey.

820
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:07,847
Dane.

821
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:10,519
Where's your Rock Star?

822
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,353
Don't worry about it, okay, Taz?
Do you.

823
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:15,121
-AII right. AII right.
-Do you.

824
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:18,961
Truth University, make some noise!

825
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,229
Truth University, make some noise!

826
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:24,230

01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:42,985
Yo, it's showtime.

832
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,185
It aII comes down to this,
what we do out on that stage.

833
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:50,029
I know we had a Iot of setbacks.
So what? That's why we're here.

834
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:51,826
And that's why we're Thetas.

835
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,897
And I'm proud to caII every one of you
my brothers.

836
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:56,197
We're repping Theta.

837
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:58,738
Thetas, Thetas.
We're repping Thetas.

838
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,933
Thetas, Thetas.
We're repping Thetas.

839
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:04,038
Thetas, Thetas. We're repping:

840
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:27,730
Coming through.

841
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:29,269
Truth.

842
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:35,126
AII right, Iadies and gentIemen...

843
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:38,432
...y'aII ready to do this?

844
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:44,036
Give it up for Iast year's champion,
Mu Gamma Xi.

845
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:24,608
Mu Gamma Xi! Mu Gamma Xi!
Mu Gamma Xi!

846
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:28,272
Truth University, make some noise.

847
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:42,664
Ten teams started,
but onIy two made it to the finaI round.

848
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,265
AII right, y'aII ready?

849
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:48,628
Y'aII give it up

01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:52,433

853
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,514
...Theta Nu Theta.

854
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:20,330
-I'II give you two a moment.
-Thanks.

855
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:26,508
Look, I'm-- I'm sorry.

856
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:28,701
I know.

857
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:30,645
At Ieast nobody got hurt.

858
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:34,614
You know,
I'm worried about you, son.

859
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:39,548
I know I was pretty hard on you
Iast night, but we aII make mistakes.

860
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:43,089
Part of being a man is owning up
to your mistakes.

861
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:49,291
I didn't know how to be there for you.

862
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:55,035
The onIy thing I knew how to do
was work, and that's what I did.

863
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:57,401
And I was wrong.

864
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,697
I don't ever wanna
push you away again.

865
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:03,675
You have the right to choose
your own path whether I Iike it or not.

866
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,842
And I need you to know
and feeI comfortabIe to come to me...

867
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:11,208
...with whatever you need.

868
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:19,693
You're aII I have Ieft.

869
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,494
That's exactIy why I came back.

870
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:26,562
I beIong here,
and I ain't going anywhere.

871
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,569
Not again.

872
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:36,139
I stiII got so much to fix.

873
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:39,239
I gotta pay these guys,
make things up to Nikki.

874
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:44,185
-I don't even know where to start.
-You might start with that competition.

875
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,011
Since when do you care
about the competition?

876
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,657
I don't care about the competition.

877
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,389
I care about my son.

878
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:57,063
Do you care enough
to come watch me?

879
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,757
Yeah.

880
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,532
AII right, y'aII.
Put your hands together.

881
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:06,470
Make some noise
for Truth University's own...

882
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:09,133
...Mu Gamma Xi.

883
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:14,274
Yeah!

884
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:31,262
-AII right!
-Mu Gamma Xi!

885
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:40,406
M-U G-A-M-M-A X-/, step.

886
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:41,668
Mu Gamma.

887
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,479
Mu Gamma Xi.

888
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:52,353
Mu Gamma.

889
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,614
Mu Gamma Xi.

890
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:12,539
M-U Gamma Xi.

891
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:18,174
M-U Gamma Xi.
M-U Gamma Xi.

892
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:21,879
Hey, ho, hey, ho.
We'll show you how the Gammas go.

893
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:25,649
Sing it.

894
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,522
You can't touch Mu Gamma Xi.

895
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:35,123
Mu.

896
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,563
Mu Gamma Xi.

897
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:26,798
Come on, ya'II, Iet me hear it again
for Mu Gamma Xi.

898
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:35,984
Mu Gamma Xi!
Mu Gamma Xi! Mu....

899
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:48,558
This is it.

900
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,528
It's time to go to battIe.

901
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:58,103
I've been in your shoes.
Those very same boots.

902
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:01,102
I ain't gonna Iie to you.

903
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:04,712
Ain't gonna be easy.
Ain't gonna be no cakewaIk.

904
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,472
But you guys have a choice.

905
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:10,483
You can go out there and give them
exactIy what they expect...

906
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:13,784
...for the Thetas to Iose again...

907
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,322
...or you can Iook
to the man next to you...

908
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,819
...and you can decide as a team...

909
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:23,328
...that you're gonna prove them wrong,
show them what happens...

910
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:26,468
...when you give up,
when you sIeep on this fraternity...

911
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:29,832
...when you forget who we are,
what this pIedge stands for...

912
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,996
...what this brotherhood is aII about.

913
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:34,233
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

914
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,968
-DefiniteIy.
-Yeah.

915
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:42,917
Each one of you has to decide
that you want this so bad...

916
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,212
...that you're so hungry...

917
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:47,912
...that nothing's gonna stand
in your way.

918
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:54,019
If there's one thing I know
about this team, it's that we fight.

919
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:55,686
-Yes, sir.
-DefiniteIy.

920
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:56,990
-We fight.
-Yeah.

921
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,428
-Damn right.
-Yes, we do.

922
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,160
-When the chips are down, we fight.
-Yeah.

923
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,861
When the deck is stacked against us,
we fight.

924
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,166
-Yeah.
-Every step of the journey...

925
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,571
...tiII we don't got a ounce
of fight Ieft.

926
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:09,801
That's right.

927
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:13,937
If you can stand together, right here,
right now, as a famiIy...

928
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,145
...ain't nothing stopping us.

929
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:21,550
If you can have enough courage
to Iook past what's wrong...

930
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,587
...to see the vaIue in what's right...

931
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,487
...win or Iose, we win.

932
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:31,929
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

933
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,661
Now, can we go out there
and show them the strength...

934
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,203
...of the future Iegacy...

935
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:40,205
...that is Theta Nu Theta
Fraternity Incorporated?

936
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,206
-Can we do that?
-Yes, sir!

937
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:44,675
-Can we be victorious?
-Yes, we can!

938
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:46,371
-Theta what?
-Theta Nu!

939
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:47,810
-Theta what?
-Theta Nu!

940
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,280
-Theta what?
-Theta Nu!

941
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:51,914
Let's do it.

942
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,416
AII right,
we about to get this thing jumping off.

943
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,924
Y'aII give it up,
show your Iove right now...

944
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:01,221
...for Theta Nu Theta.

945
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:09,401
Let's go. AII right.

946
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:44,036
-Let's go, Thetas.
-Let's see it, boy.

947
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,301
Theta Nu.

948
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,338
Theta Nu.

949
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:54,005
T-H-E-T-A.
We're gonna break it down.

950
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,555
AII right.

951
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:31,045
Who's the master?

952
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:32,686
Theta!

953
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:34,879
I said, who's the master?

954
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:36,654
Theta!

955
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:47,096
Rock Star!

956
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:07,078
Chance!

957
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:57,093
AII right, y'aII.

958
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:01,224
OnIy one team wiII Ieave tonight
as the Sprite Step Off champions.

959
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,200
Are you ready?

960
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:10,705
AII right. This has been a fierce,
fierce competition.

961
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:14,680
First pIace, show your Iove...

962
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,579
...for Theta Nu Theta!

963
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:21,956
Yeah!

964
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:29,160
Theta! Theta! Theta!

965
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:32,425
Theta! Theta! Theta!

966
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:50,014
Oh, man.

967
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:52,050
-We did it, baby.
-You were amazing.

968
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,916
-I toId you, baby.
-No, you, y'aII, you.

969
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:59,083
You're freaking Iiving Iegends, baby.
AII right? Living Iegends.

970
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:01,786
-I'II be out in a minute.
-Yes, sir. Come on.

971
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,941
I'm so proud of you.

972
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:32,323
Go.

973
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,226
I'II be right back, okay?

974
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:07,292
You just keep pIaying
with my money, man.

975
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:10,989
Me tearing up that restaurant
didn't send a strong enough message.

976
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:13,366
Now I'm gonna have to
hurt somebody.

977
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:16,627
CouIdn't Iose the competition
for my team, man.

978
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:19,732
Now, what I wiII do...

979
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:22,433
...is give you the money I owe
with the winnings.

980
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:25,102
Chance, do I Iook Iike a fooI?

981
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,443
-Let's go, man. Come on.
-Yo, wait up. HoId up, hoId up.

982
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:31,882
Yo, dude, this here's coIIege.
We don't get down Iike that.

983
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:35,352
He toId me what happened.
Take what he offers and keep moving.

984
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:39,289
SeriousIy, grown foIks taIking.
Why don't you mind your business?

985
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:41,292
No, he is my business.

986
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,495
If you think you're going anywhere
with Chance...

987
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:53,868
...you're gonna have to hurt aII of us.

988
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:10,353
You're gonna meet me tomorrow
with the 5 grand you owe me.

989
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,823
But if I have to find you again...

990
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,923
...I don't care if Obama's
on your pIedge Iine.

991
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:20,193
I'II handIe that, partner.
Do you hear me?

992
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,163
Let's go.

993
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:30,705
Good evening, gentIemen.

994
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:46,260
-Y'aII didn't have to do that.
-Are you crazy?

995
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:49,864
I toId you yesterday, regardIess
of what happens, we're brothers.

996
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:52,324
-We got your back.
-Ain't going nowhere.

997
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,592
-For Iife.
-AII right?

998
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:56,260
Hey, what can I say, man?

999
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:58,269
When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong.

1000
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,907
I expect you to represent
whiIe you're here at Truth.

1001
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:05,107
Even if you are a Theta.

1002
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:10,475
-You know what I'm saying.
-One big thing we're forgetting.

1003
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,142
We won!

1004
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:24,825
Who's the man? Who's the man?
Who's the man?

1005
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:28,231
Thetas, Thetas.
We're repping Thetas.

1006
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:30,837
Thetas: Thetas.

1007
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,497
Thetas, Thetas. We're repping:

1008
01:23:34,305 --> 01:24:34,730
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
