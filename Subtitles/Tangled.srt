00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,158
I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.

318
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,660
"Floating lights,"
and, yes, I'm leading up to that.

Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

320
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,415
No, Mother, I'm just saying,

321
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,001
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

322
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,337
Oh, I know you're not strong enough
to handle yourself out there.

323
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,674
- But if you just...
- We're done talking about this.

00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,302
- Trust me! I know what I'm...
- Rapunzel.

325
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,929
- Oh, come on!
- Enough with the lights!

326
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:14,434
You are not leaving this tower! Ever!

327
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:24,444
(GROANS) Great. Now I'm the bad guy.

328
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,792
All I was going to say, Mother, is that...

329
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,213
I know what I want for my birthday now.

330
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,298
And what is that?

331
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,050
New paint.

332
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:51,054
The paint made from the white shells
you once brought me.

333
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:56,309
That is a very long trip, Rapunzel.
Almost three days' time.

334
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,648

than the stars.

The name's Flynn Rider.

- Rapunzel.

Gesundheit. Here's the deal.

368
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,230
I was in a situation,
gallivanting through the forest.

369
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,607
I came across your tower and...

370
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:50,983
Oh! Oh, no.

371
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,360
Where is my satchel?

372
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,863
I've hidden it.
Somewhere you'll never find it.

373
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,660
It's in that pot, isn't it?

Now it's hidden
where you'll never find it.

379
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,093
So, what do you want with my hair?
To cut it?

380
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,428
- What?
- Sell it?

381
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:22,181
No! Listen, the only thing
I want to do with your hair

382
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,600
is to get out of it, literally.

You...

384
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:28,479
Wait. You don't want my hair?

385
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,523
Why on earth would I want your hair?

386

I saw a tower, I climbed it.

- Deal?
- Look this way.

Do you know what these are?

402
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,816
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

403
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,820
Lanterns? I knew they weren't stars.

404
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,240
Well, tomorrow evening,

405
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:25,203
they will light the night sky
with these lanterns.

406
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:28,873
You will act as my guide,
take me to these lanterns,

407
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,541
and return me home safely.

408
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,962
Then, and only then,
will I return your satchel to you.

409
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,255
That is my deal.

410
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,507
Yeah.

No can do.

413
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,055
Unfortunately the kingdom and I
aren't exactly simpatico at the moment,

414
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,432
so I won't be taking you anywhere.

415
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,192
Something brought you here,
Flynn Rider.

- fate, destiny...
- A horse.

418
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,032
So I have made the decision
to trust you.

419
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,219
A horrible decision, really.

420

But trust me when I tell you this.

421
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,750
You can tear this tower apart
brick by brick,

422
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:17,588
but without my help, you will never find
your precious satchel.

and you'll give me back my satchel?

I promise.

I never, ever break that promise.
