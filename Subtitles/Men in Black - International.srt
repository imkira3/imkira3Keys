1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

3
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:35,692
God, do I hate Paris.

4
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:37,425
Not to worry.
Probably won't be

5
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:39,228
around
much longer.

6
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:03,585
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

7
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,890
I guess what...
What I'm trying to say is,

8
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:07,859
- Lisa, will you mar...?
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

9
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:11,494
We're with
Tower security.

10
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:13,562
Uh, we're
terribly sorry,

11
00:02:13,564 --> 00:02:15,465
but you're not
supposed to be here.

12
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:16,698
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

13
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,802
So? She say yes?

14
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:21,237
- I haven't asked yet.
- He hasn't asked yet.

15
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,873
Oh, well, that's
a terrible shame, isn't it?

16
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,375
Because, you see, that
blinking light back there

17
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:29,311
means there's been
a breach in Portal 2.

18
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:30,880
Which means,
in just a few minutes,

19
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:33,348
the most vile creatures
in the entire universe,

20
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,616
the Hive,
are gonna consume

21
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:37,252
every last one
of us from the inside out.

22
00:02:37,254 --> 00:02:38,257
I don't understand.

23
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:42,926
All will be explained
if you look right...

24
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:44,161
here.

25
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:47,564
The Tower was closed
for repairs.

26
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,398
Ask her
on the way down.

27
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,468
This way,
please.

28
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:53,736
Thank you.

29
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,441
Mind
the gap.

30
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:04,413
Right. Shall we?

31
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:05,584
Let's do this.

32
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:21,231
Hey, guys.

33
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,734
Who the hell
are you?

34
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:26,469
Ask her again
down on the ground.

35
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:38,982
- Whew.
- Ah, there you are.

36
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:40,850
Yeah.
All right.

37
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,618
Let's try this again,
shall we?

38
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:52,362
So, what's
the play here?

39
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:54,530
We've been
in this situation before.

40
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:56,531
We've never faced
the Hive before.

41
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,969
They've never
faced us.

42
00:03:58,203 --> 00:03:59,469
Always remember,

43
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,336
The universe has
a way of leading you

44
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:02,738
to where
you're supposed to be

45
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,906
at the moment
you're supposed to be there.

46
00:04:04,908 --> 00:04:07,609
Yeah, well, sometimes,
the universe gets it wrong.

47
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:43,913
"Let's have some action.

48
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:45,714
I want some
asses wiggling.

49
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:47,716
I want some perfection."

50
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:53,391
Get my
three-wood.

51
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:56,427
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay, okay.

52
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,629
Careful.

53
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:05,937
Oh, my God!

54
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:09,605
- Oh, my God. Baby.
- What?

55
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:10,607
Uh...

56
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:13,375
That wasn't
no animal, okay?

57
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:15,644
It was a...
It was a...

58
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:18,046
I ain't never seen
nothing like that before.

59
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:20,348
It was, like,
a creature.

60
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,752
What? Harold,
call the police.

61
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:24,986
- The who?
- The police. Call the police!

62
00:05:26,723 --> 00:05:28,423
That was fast.

63
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:30,625
Evening.
We're from Animal Control.

64
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:32,995
- You saw something?
- We haven't called yet.

65
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:35,565
Are we in danger?
Does it have rabies?

66
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,433
That wasn't a regular animal.

67
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,435
- It was like...
- The creature you saw was

68
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:42,370
an unlicensed Tarantian
from Andromeda II.

69
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:43,772
Very rare, very dangerous.

70
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:45,873
- Sorry, what?
- A Tarantian.

71
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,444
I know.
He looks cute now.

72
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,512
- Tarantian?
- But when they hit puberty,

73
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:51,049
they turn into real monsters.

74
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,791
Shh.

75
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:04,760
Don't be scared.
It's okay.

76
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:07,029
Tell me,
is there anyone else in the house?

77
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:09,401
Just our daughter.
She's sleeping.

78
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:15,070
A raccoon.
Yeah, that's your problem, folks.

79
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:17,505
Go ahead and make sure
those trash can lids

80
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:20,644
are on nice and tight,
and we were never here.

81
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:25,647
We should
go check on Molly.

82
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:28,517
We've gotta
get you out of here.

83
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:33,057
Come on.

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,632
It's okay.

85
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:47,570
I'm your friend. I'm Molly. Go on.

86
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:50,141
Molly.

87
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,177
<i>Kabla nakshulin.</i>

88
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:58,048
<i>Kabla nakshulin.</i>

89
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:03,153
Well, Molly,
you've scored excellent

90
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:05,521
or above
in every area.

91
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:08,022
Fitness,
deductive reasoning, logic,

92
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:09,658
weapons training.

93
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,928
Just one problem.

94
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,598
You didn't check a box.

95
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:18,804
For your preferred division.
Everyone has to check a box.

96
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,470
Hm.

97
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,007
Yeah, I made my own box

98
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:28,947
for the division
that has no box.

99
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:34,149
You know, the division
where they wear black suits

100
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:36,752
and deal with the guys from...

101
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:40,992
...up there.

102
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:44,659
You mean, Accounting?

103
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:45,661
No, like...

104
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:52,800
Yeah, still...

105
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:54,570
Accounting.

106
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:01,976
That should fix the glitch.

107
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:04,813
- Remember, we care.
- You're good to go.

108
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:08,584
And remember, we care.

109
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:10,786
Look for the icon marked
advanced extensions.

110
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:12,620
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Click on it.

111
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,522
<i>Which icon?
There's a bunch...</i>

112
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:17,860
- Thirteenth icon from the left.
<i>- Whose left?</i>

113
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:20,230
- Your left.
<i>- Oh, sorry.</i>

114
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,531
- <i>I got it now.</i>
- Okay, got it?

115
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,199
<i>Yeah, got it.</i>

116
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:25,935
<i>Are you still there?</i>

117
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:27,870
- <i>Hello? Help. What's going on?</i>
- Oh, no.

118
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:30,740
Nothing. Let me just run
a little diagnostic on my end,

119
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:32,908
and I will be back.
No, it won't take long.

120
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,144
Not long at all. Okay.

121
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:39,046
What the f...?

122
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:41,052
- This is perplexing.
- Is it?

123
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,219
Is it?

124
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:47,555
A-L-I-E-N-S?

125
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:49,092
I don't know why
you always insist

126
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,026
on whispering
and spelling that.

127
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:52,994
Finally decided
to show up, huh?

128
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:56,898
Oh, my God.

129
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,269
All I have to do
is figure out

130
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,238
trajectory, and I am in.

131
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,271
- I'm back. Okay, try this.
<i>- Hi.</i>

132
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:04,307
- Unplug it, plug it back in.
<i>- Okay.</i>

133
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,244
- And remember, we care.
<i>- Hello?</i>

134
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:13,616
I have to go.

135
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:17,252
Jimmy's coming back
to get the kids.

136
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:18,590
Yes.

137
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:26,695
Okay. Let's see
where you are now.

138
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,302
<i>Welcome back,
Professor Armitage.</i>

139
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:37,873
Oh, you tricky one.

140
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,311
I don't think you're
a meteor after all, are you?

141
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:44,915
Nope, I think you are
an unauthorized landing.

142
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,150
This is it.

143
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:49,854
It's all happening.

144
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:53,222
See you soon, Jimmy.

145
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:05,834
Right here, right here.

146
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,772
Right here.

147
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:10,839
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

148
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:12,742
Please keep
the meter running.

149
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:13,843
I'll pay you
extra.

150
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:14,846
What?

151
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:19,307
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, Jimmy.

152
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:21,243
What are you doing
back on Earth?

153
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:23,746
Hey, this is...?
This is Earth?

154
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:25,012
My bad, guys.
Come on.

155
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:26,415
Tell it to O back at HQ.

156
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:27,949
I want to see my kids.

157
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:29,419
Get this ship out of here.

158
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:31,889
I'll escort our
Zamporian friend back.

159
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:46,901
- Don't lose them.
- What?

160
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,073
- I'm on it. On it.
- Go, go, go. Go.

161
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:20,167
Hey,
did they bring in that Zamporian yet?

162
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:22,171
Came in a couple of
minutes ahead of you.

163
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:25,107
The guy tried to sneak in
behind a Perseid meteor shower.

164
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:27,511
Amateur hour. Am I right?

165
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:29,047
Right as rain.

166
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:32,216
Rain don't lie.

167
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:41,123
Sheesh, talk about
amateur hour.

168
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,027
Hey, you gonna
call this in, or what?

169
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:47,765
Code Black.

170
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:58,807
<i>Unauthorized visitor.</i>

171
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:01,009
<i>Lockdown protocol engaged</i>

172
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:03,513
<i>in three, two, one.</i>

173
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:11,920
All right,
who's she working for?

174
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:13,421
She claims to be
working alone.

175
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:15,324
A random civilian
simply waltzes in

176
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,995
off the high street.
I don't think so.

177
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Neuralyze her.

178
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:28,573
No, no, no. Don't.

179
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:31,073
I know what that thing is.
Please.

180
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,977
<i>Hang on. Hang on.</i>

181
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:38,046
She had
an experience.

182
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:41,349
It erased my parents' memories,
but it didn't take mine.

183
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:44,520
So my whole life,
everyone's called me crazy.

184
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:46,220
They said that
I needed therapy,

185
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:49,056
which, okay,
admittedly, I did,

186
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,959
but not for this.

187
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:53,161
Did she really hack
into the Hubble Telescope

188
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:55,964
to look at Andromeda II,
and we didn't catch her?

189
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:58,068
In the old days,
we'd have hired her.

190
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:04,406
It took me 20 years to find you,
plus or minus.

191
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,311
How many people
can say that?

192
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:10,581
I found you.

193
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,924
So you found us.
You proved you're not crazy.

194
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:24,993
You win the I'm Not Crazy
badge. Now what?

195
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:27,329
- I want in.
- We don't hire. We recruit.

196
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,633
Then I'd like
to be recruited.

197
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:33,200
I'm going to need more.

198
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:36,304
But would you mind giving me
one good reason?

199
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,174
Because I'm smart.

200
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:40,175
I'm motivated.

201
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:42,044
I look good in black.
I'm...

202
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:43,414
Boring me.

203
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:47,351
Because I have absolutely
no life whatsoever.

204
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:51,152
I have nothing.
I have no dog, no cat,

205
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:52,487
definitely no chill.

206
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:54,055
I have nothing
that I couldn't

207
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:55,324
happily walk away from,

208
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:57,359
which makes me
perfect for this job.

209
00:14:57,361 --> 00:15:00,463
Well, you're certainly
suitably tragic.

210
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:03,331
No love?
No relationships?

211
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,566
They just distract you from
what's important.

212
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:07,905
Hm, really?
And what's important?

213
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,942
The truth
of the universe.

214
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,507
I wanna know everything.

215
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,312
I wanna know
how it all works.

216
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,479
You really think
a black suit

217
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:21,016
is going to solve
all your problems?

218
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:25,121
Mmm... No,
but it looks damn good on you.

219
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:26,456
That's true.

220
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:46,275
<i>From this
moment, you will conform</i>

221
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:49,243
<i>to the identity we give you.</i>

222
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:52,716
<i>You will dress only
in MIB Special Services attire.</i>

223
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:56,484
<i>You have been trained
in the use</i>

224
00:15:56,486 --> 00:16:01,058
<i>of MIB-sanctioned technology,
vehicles and weaponry.</i>

225
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:04,493
Mm-mm.

226
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:07,065
<i>You will not
stand out in any way.</i>

227
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:14,268
<i>You are no longer
part of the system.</i>

228
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,138
<i>You do not exist.</i>

229
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,473
Check, please.

230
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,275
We are above the system.

231
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,544
Over it, beyond it.
We are them. We are they.

232
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:23,712
We are
the Men in Black.

233
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:26,047
The "Men"
in Black?

234
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:27,715
Don't.
Don't start.

235
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:29,517
I've had
the conversation.

236
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,554
They didn't seem
to be able to let it go.

237
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:33,689
It's a process.
Attachment issue, I think.

238
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:36,458
There's
your first assignment.

239
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,526
Okay.
When do I get my...?

240
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:39,940
It's called a neuralyzer.

241
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:42,730
And you don't just get it,
you earn it.

242
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:45,633
You've been accepted
for a probationary period.

243
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:48,536
Impress me, and
we'll see about the bzzz.

244
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:50,140
- Okay.
- Hm.

245
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:54,475
You're a fan of the truth,
aren't you, Agent M?

246
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:56,445
- I like it.
- Mm.

247
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:58,479
I think we may have
a problem in London.

248
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:10,795
Wow, that is smooth.

249
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:12,526
Let's keep them coming,
shall we?

250
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:13,694
Another
round.

251
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:15,296
Ah!

252
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:18,234
So can I just say how much
I'm liking this place?

253
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,201
It's formal,
but not too stuffy.

254
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:22,603
Classic, but still
kind of stylish.

255
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:25,673
Makes it a very <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>
kind of vibe.

256
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:27,308
I'm kidding.

257
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,378
Sort of.

258
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:33,547
Hoo, hoo!

259
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:35,150
Or is it
mostly just

260
00:17:35,152 --> 00:17:36,684
the lethal high-stakes
gambling?

261
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:38,353
Thank you very much.

262
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:41,122
Would you look at that?
Straight to the ace, gentlemen.

263
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:42,124
That's me again.

264
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:46,463
Let's talk business,
shall we?

265
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:49,797
I can move this stuff.

266
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,533
Who do I speak with
about getting

267
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:53,334
a lot more of it?
Because I'm in.

268
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:54,336
You're not.

269
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:57,206
You see, I have
a very strict

270
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,408
"no Men in Black"
policy.

271
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,142
Oh, God.

272
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:02,443
I don't blame you.

273
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:04,645
Who'd want those assholes
coming in here?

274
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:07,615
Men in Black. The Morons
in Black, if you ask me.

275
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:09,418
What a bunch of dicks.
Am I right?

276
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,488
All it takes is one bad apple
to spoil any environment...

277
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:18,559
Stop it, guys.

278
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:40,417
I am MIB,
you Cerulian scum.

279
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:44,687
And FYI, your little
club here sucks.

280
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:46,721
You're gonna give me
everything.

281
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:49,391
Suppliers, sellers,
your whole network.

282
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,399
Your luck run out.

283
00:18:57,401 --> 00:18:58,902
You're already dead.

284
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,573
Only one person here
has the antidote.

285
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,910
Emily, sweetheart.

286
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:19,222
Please, I'll... I'll give you
whatever you want.

287
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,793
Please.
Anything you want.

288
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:25,663
Anything I want?

289
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:12,806
<i>The express

Caught him

293
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,319
I knew that kid
was neuralyzing himself.

294
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:27,822
I told him, "Do that too much,
and you'll go blind."

295
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:29,458
Right?

296
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,959
Who could go for a nosh?

297
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:33,461
I'd like a
nice pastrami sandwich.

Yes, I am.

I'm T. High T.

Oh, yeah.
You're...

- I run this little circus.
- Yeah.

It's nice

O told me to expect
some great things.

- And great things shall you get.
- Good.

317
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,161

Oh, God.

321

00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:36,713
I got him. I got him.

323
00:25:00,596 --> 00:25:02,098
Change it, change it.

324
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:17,913
All right, buddy.

325
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:21,248
All right. Drink this.

326
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:17,807
Oh, careful.
You break it, you buy it.

327
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:24,911
Keep it. Keep it.

328
00:26:24,913 --> 00:26:25,913
On me.

329
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:28,152
We need to see
the queen.

330
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:30,251
Yes.

331
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:41,598
Uh-oh.

332
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:43,765
You have
visitors.

333
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:53,307
State your business
with the queen.

334
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:54,845
We need someone
to die.

335
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:05,886
As clearly stated in Section 6C
of the Treaty of Andromeda II,

336
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:07,354
we do not kill Jababians

337
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:09,923
nor participate
in the murder thereof.

338
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:11,861
This is nonnegotiable.

339
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:17,030
Well, it's slightly
negotiable.

340
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:32,647
Oy!

341
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:35,884
Morning.

342
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,987
I'm in the market
for a useless, old,

343
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:40,921
broken-down machine.
What do you got?

344
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:43,123
You're not gonna
get a rise out of me, H.

345
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,026
It's the Imperial
with the red tab.

346
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:46,827
Do try to keep up.

347
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:48,864
Thank you, Charlie.

348
00:27:57,641 --> 00:27:59,740
That's the old
portal depot.

349
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:02,376
Site of the First
Great Alien Migration.

350
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:05,013
Wait,
so Eiffel was an MIB agent?

351
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:06,280
One of
the first.

352
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:08,382
He helped so many
intergalactic refugees

353
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:10,218
seeking protection
here on Earth.

354
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,353
If you look closely,
you can see my grandma

355
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:13,988
and my grandpa
in that picture.

356
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,192
So beautiful.

357
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:18,395
- Here you are, dear.
- Thank you.

358
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:37,381
What's
up with that guy?

359
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:49,958
Nerlene!

360
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,461
Sorry.

361
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:53,428
He's just
so yummy.

362
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,930
- Who is he?
- H.

363
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:57,864
Only the best agent
in the building.

364
00:28:57,866 --> 00:29:00,200
He saved the world once
with nothing but his wits

365
00:29:00,202 --> 00:29:02,504
and a Series-7
De-Atomizer.

366
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:05,038
He saved
the world?

367
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,109
From what?

368
00:29:07,143 --> 00:29:08,809
The Hive.

369
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:10,311
The Hive.

370
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:12,482
Hey, Guy,
do me a favor.

371
00:29:12,715 --> 00:29:14,882
- Handle my calls.
- Oh, love to.

372
00:29:14,884 --> 00:29:16,950
Where are you
going?

373
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:18,154
To do some homework.

374
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:24,892
An awful,
terrible incident in Marrakesh.

375
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:27,428
The North Africa office
is investigating.

376
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,197
And in
other business,

377
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:32,299
H has decided to grace us
with his presence after all.

378
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:35,036
Apologies, sir. I was working
late. Morning, everyone.

379
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,104
So was I. Cleaning
your mess. Thank you.

380
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:40,040
You should've seen the mess
I was cleaning up this morning.

381
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,242
It was a totally
unsanctioned op, sir,

382
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:45,278
requiring two containment units
and a full neuralyzer squad.

383
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,015
I prefer to look at this
from a macro point of view,

384
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:49,519
not get bogged
in the details.

385
00:29:49,752 --> 00:29:52,186
The bad guy's dead,
so, you know.

386
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:54,988
Take a seat, please.
One last item.

387
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,093
A member of the
Jababian royal family

388
00:29:58,095 --> 00:30:01,194
has a layover on his way
to Centaurus A.

389
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:02,896
Vungus the Ugly.

390
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:04,167
Inherited the title.

391
00:30:05,468 --> 00:30:07,934
Believe it or not,
Vungus here

392
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:09,402
is the looker
in the crowd.

393
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:11,072
Holograms always add
10 pounds.

394
00:30:11,074 --> 00:30:13,207
Jababian society doesn't allow

395
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:15,977
for certain
indiscretions.

396
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:19,180
In short, he wants
to be shown a good time.

397
00:30:19,182 --> 00:30:22,984
We could say no,
but Jababian mining vessels

398
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:25,085
would grind us
into galactic dust.

399
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:27,921
Some irony there, sir, if you
think that we used to, uh,

400
00:30:27,923 --> 00:30:30,056
protect Earth
from the scum of the universe.

401
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:31,859
Now it seems
we're protecting scum.

402
00:30:31,861 --> 00:30:34,394
Actually, that's why it would
be right up your street.

403
00:30:34,396 --> 00:30:36,131
Your cup of tea, H.

404
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,399
I know Vungus.
He doesn't really drink tea.

405
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:39,934
He prefers vodka,
tequila,

406
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:41,604
hand sanitizer,
sometimes all at once.

407
00:30:41,837 --> 00:30:43,572
Once, we woke up
handcuffed to a horse...

408
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:45,206
- What, H?
- Pipe down.

409
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,240
Sorry.
Sincere apologies.

410
00:30:47,242 --> 00:30:48,610
You will be
his chaperone.

411
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:51,046
In fact, he specifically
asked for you.

412
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:53,180
Okay. Absolutely,
hopefully we don't end up

413
00:30:53,182 --> 00:30:54,882
handcuffed to
a horse again, heh.

414
00:30:54,884 --> 00:30:56,049
Please.

415
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:57,451
I'll have him home
by midnight.

416
00:30:57,453 --> 00:30:59,021
Good boy.
If you will.

417
00:31:00,189 --> 00:31:01,421
"Good boy.
If you will."

418
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:02,923
"Good man,"
I think he said.

419
00:31:02,925 --> 00:31:04,257
Keep Daddy
happy, yeah?

420
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:05,426
We're like this.

421
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:06,927
You look
after <i>Papi</i> so well.

422
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:08,363
You're so jealous,
aren't you?

423
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:09,497
<i>Papi's</i>
little fancy boy.

424
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:10,901
You wish
you had a <i>papi.</i>

425
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:14,936
...They came in
on transportation...

426
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:23,513
Uh, ahem.

427
00:31:25,347 --> 00:31:26,347
Hello.

428
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:30,419
Whoo! Oops.

429
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:33,988
- Sorry.
- Ahem. Hi.

430
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,056
Hey. Nope, I'm awake.
It's all right.

431
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:38,559
Just catching up
on my daily meditation.

432
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:40,361
I have been meaning
to try that.

433
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:42,162
I read that it
dramatically improves

434
00:31:42,164 --> 00:31:43,631
mitochondrial energy
production.

435
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:45,668
Yep, yep.
No, it absolutely does.

436
00:31:45,902 --> 00:31:47,938
My mitochondrial energy's
through the roof.

437
00:31:49,372 --> 00:31:52,140
- Um... Have we met before?
- No. Agent M.

438
00:31:52,142 --> 00:31:53,940
I heard you were
on the Vungus meet,

439
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:55,476
and I wanted
to offer assistance.

440
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:57,378
I'm a bit of
a Jababian wonk.

441
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,248
Language, culture,
politics, fashion.

442
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,018
Anyways, I compiled
a dossier for you to read.

443
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,121
Oh, a dossier. I love
a good dossier.

444
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:09,157
The thing is...
Ask around.

445
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,458
I work alone.
Ask anyone around here.

446
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,261
Did you know that Jababians
are claircognizant empaths,

447
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:16,096
which means
they can read your mind?

448
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:17,532
And your cards.

449
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:20,367
- Well, they do have a tell.
- What's that?

450
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:23,238
Subdermal spots on
the underside of their arms

451
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,971
- change color.
- Mm, good to know.

452
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:27,373
Thank you for your offer.
I'm good.

453
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,276
Okay. Message
understood.

454
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:31,211
I will leave you
to your...

455
00:32:31,213 --> 00:32:32,246
meditation.

456
00:32:32,248 --> 00:32:33,248
Thank you.

457
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:36,985
Oh.

458
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:39,086
Do you know
what your tell is?

459
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:41,157
You snore
when you meditate.

460
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,100
Actually, on second thought,
maybe I could use some backup.

461
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:23,030
I was thinking, for the op,
I can take the perimeter,

462
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:25,667
- and you make the approach to Vungus.
- Yes, good.

463
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:29,236
- Okay.
- The thing is, with this particular club.

464
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:31,372
everybody just wants
to do their own thing.

465
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:34,374
Aliens wanna look like humans,
humans wanna look like aliens,

466
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:36,143
so we may need
to loosen up a bit.

467
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:39,346
Maybe we lose
the tie first, yeah?

468
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:43,284
Pop a couple of buttons
and not look so stiff.

469
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:45,385
We don't want to advertise
our profession,

470
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:47,121
if you know
what I mean.

471
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:49,457
"Men in Black.
Aliens, get down!"

472
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:51,392
- I get it.
- Don't do that.

473
00:33:51,394 --> 00:33:54,263
Yeah? Good. Great. Perfect.
How about me? How do I look?

474
00:33:56,231 --> 00:33:57,731
I would just, uh.

475
00:33:57,733 --> 00:33:59,132
- Do you mind if I...?
- What?

476
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:00,334
Coming in.

477
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:02,303
It's a fine line
between club casual

478
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:03,773
and the saddest man
on Earth.

479
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:05,271
Thank you.

480
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:07,173
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah. Shall we?

481
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:08,776
I thought
that we were here.

482
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:10,577
We are.

483
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:12,345
Entrance
for special guests.

484
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:18,186
Step on it,
would you, Freddie?

485
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:19,389
You got it, H.

486
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:25,362
Hm.

487
00:34:27,063 --> 00:34:29,530
Yeah, okay.
Wasn't expecting that.

488
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:50,251
The Vungus among us!

489
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:53,320
H-Bomb!

490
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:55,188
- V-Go! V-Go!
- Yeah, yeah!

491
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,657
- Yeah!
- Woo!

492
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,760
Look at you.
You've lost weight.

493
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:00,427
What have you done
to your hair?

494
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:01,864
You changed it.
Looks fantastic.

495
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:03,866
- Oh, I...
- I barely recognize you.

496
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:07,233
Sorry. M, this
is Vungus. Vungus, M.

497
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:09,670
Hello, M.

498
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:11,472
Muah.

499
00:35:11,474 --> 00:35:13,407
So nice
to meet you.

500
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:14,844
I've heard
a lot about you.

501
00:35:15,077 --> 00:35:16,411
Highly redacted,
of course.

502
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:29,157
Such a charmer. He says...

503
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,860
he thinks
you're hot.

504
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:32,360
He thinks I'm what?
Sorry?

505
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:33,863
It's a rough translation.

506
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:35,862
Probably works better
on Ja... Jababia,

507
00:35:35,864 --> 00:35:38,834
but you know that,
since you speak fluent Jababian.

508
00:35:39,101 --> 00:35:40,700
Oh.

509
00:35:40,702 --> 00:35:43,873
Of course. I was just trying
to find the words to articulate

510
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:46,673
how incredibly eye-catching
you yourself are.

511
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,675
Well, that he is.

512
00:35:48,677 --> 00:35:50,711
M knows everything
about Jababia.

513
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:53,280
I wouldn't say "everything."
Always more to learn.

514
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:54,648
It's like
a fetish.

515
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,650
Hah, okay, that implies
something sexual.

516
00:35:56,652 --> 00:35:57,887
- It's definitely not.
- It is.

517
00:35:58,121 --> 00:35:59,554
It's always,
"Oh, Jababia this,

518
00:35:59,556 --> 00:36:01,554
Jababia that, Jababia,
Jababia, Jababia!"

519
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:02,856
Yeah, baby!

520
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:04,726
I knew you would hit it off.

521
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:06,626
Have a dance, okay?
M loves to dance.

522
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:08,762
She's a wonderful dancer.
I'll get drinks.

523
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:10,530
You're still
a vodka cranberry guy?

524
00:36:10,532 --> 00:36:11,865
You know it.

525
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:12,867
Okay. Okay.

526
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,570
M, please.

527
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:17,905
Come, sit next
to Vungus.

528
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:19,907
I promise, I don't bite.

529
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:21,943
Okay, just give me
one sec.

530
00:36:22,177 --> 00:36:23,711
Four
vodka cranberries.

531
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:25,479
It's all right.
I'll get this one.

532
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:26,780
Put it on
the company card.

533
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:28,416
Little tip,
expense everything.

534
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:29,918
Hey, quick question,
no big deal.

535
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,318
Are you pimping me out
to Vungus?

536
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,753
What? No.

537
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:36,423
What the hell would give you
that... impression?

538
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:38,691
Hello. Ha-ha-ha!

539
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:41,461
- Oh, I don't know. That?
- Oh, ahem.

540
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:42,829
Better not look at that.

541
00:36:42,831 --> 00:36:44,764
Hey, if you wanna use me
as alien bait,

542
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:46,266
just let me know next time.

543
00:36:46,268 --> 00:36:47,568
I don't like to be lied to.

544
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,436
What, like pretending
to be an expert

545
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:51,304
in something you're not?

546
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:52,940
We're in
the lying business.

547
00:36:52,942 --> 00:36:55,543
- Are we?
- Jababians are prickly.

548
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:56,876
We want them to be happy.

549
00:36:56,878 --> 00:36:59,380
So they don't destroy our planet
and everything.

550
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:00,680
That is the mission.

551
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:01,949
If you're not
down with...

552
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:03,450
I'm down
with the mission,

553
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:05,519
but I'm not fornicating
with the Jababian.

554
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:06,990
That's not what
I asked you to do.

555
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:21,903
So how long
you here for, buddy?

556
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:23,704
Vungus go home tomorrow.

557
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:25,305
Tomorrow?

558
00:37:25,307 --> 00:37:27,277
We better make it
a good one, huh?

559
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,945
I came to talk, H.
We need to speak.

560
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:33,947
Talky, shmalky.
I want to see you dance.

561
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:36,749
Come on. Come on, I know,
I know this is your jam.

562
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:38,418
Get out here. M, come on.

563
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,921
Oh, no, I'm just gonna...
I like to butt-dance.

564
00:37:57,606 --> 00:37:59,807
Hey, I need to talk
to you about something.

565
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:01,608
If it's about
that night in Beirut,

566
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,577
I deleted the photos.
Promise.

567
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:05,882
No, not Beirut.
Just...

568
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,333
- H?
- Yeah?

569
00:38:26,335 --> 00:38:27,834
- Twelve o'clock.
- You're damn right

570
00:38:27,836 --> 00:38:29,903
it is. Night is young.
Whoo-hoo!

571
00:38:29,905 --> 00:38:31,338
Listen to me, H.

572
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,039
This is serious.

573
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:35,642
You're the only one
that Vungus can trust.

574
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:37,378
Well, feeling's mutual.

575
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:46,552
What happened to you?

576
00:38:46,554 --> 00:38:48,488
Nothing.
What happened to you?

577
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,822
Why are you so
serious?

578
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:51,493
- Relax. Ow! Yeah.
- H.

579
00:39:16,684 --> 00:39:18,086
You all right, buddy?

580
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,987
What's wrong?
You don't look so good.

581
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:23,090
- You okay?
- Vungus not feel so good.

582
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:25,427
Vodka cranberry
sure pack a punch.

583
00:39:27,096 --> 00:39:29,130
Let's get his car
and get him out of here.

584
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:30,731
- Yeah. Yup.
- All right.

585
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:33,668
Okay.
Get you off to bed.

586
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,970
Let's get you in here.
All right.

587
00:39:35,972 --> 00:39:38,005
There you are, buddy.
In you go.

588
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:40,574
Watch your head. Okay.
All right.

589
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:41,876
Now, sleep it off,
okay?

590
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:43,943
I'll speak to you in
the morning. Hydrate.

591
00:39:45,414 --> 00:39:46,813
Whoo!

592
00:39:46,815 --> 00:39:48,682
- Shouldn't we call it in?
- Oh, God, no.

593
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:50,050
The paperwork
is a nightmare.

594
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:51,853
But Vungus
didn't look too good.

595
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:53,653
He didn't look
too good before, but.

596
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:55,623
Trust me,
I've seen him way worse.

597
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:56,826
This one time
in Istanbul...

598
00:40:06,034 --> 00:40:08,605
Help me.

599
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:16,911
- MIB. Freeze!
- On the ground.

600
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:17,913
- Hands up.
- Palms down.

601
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:23,485
- Palms down.
- Hands up.

602
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:27,720
Which do you want to go with?
I'm fine with either.

603
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:30,891
We've to come up with something
consistent. You want palms down?

604
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:32,492
If you don't mind.

605
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:33,797
- Palms down.
- Palms down.

606
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:37,066
Good.

607
00:40:58,086 --> 00:40:59,086
What the...?

608
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:04,825
That is not good.

609
00:41:04,827 --> 00:41:06,696
Run!

610
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:14,668
M!

611
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,135
They are coming!

612
00:41:16,137 --> 00:41:17,574
Petrol cap. Go.

613
00:41:33,956 --> 00:41:36,824
We need more firepower.
Side-view mirror.

614
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:38,894
What do you want me to do,
throw it at them?

615
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:41,463
Oh, wow.

616
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:53,809
I haven't seen that before.

617
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:57,847
I don't think
this is doing anything.

618
00:41:59,248 --> 00:42:00,248
Come on.

619
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,617
Exhaust pipe. Go!

620
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:05,688
Come on!

621
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:11,925
Now this is
more like it.

622
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:12,927
Right.

623
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:20,769
Hurry!

624
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:24,807
Go to Vungus.
I'll cover you.

625
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:33,981
H! A little help here!

626
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:36,816
No. Not H.

627
00:42:36,818 --> 00:42:38,885
He has changed.

628
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:41,021
I could feel it.

629
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,688
I have to know...

630
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:46,796
...if I can trust you.

631
00:42:52,802 --> 00:42:54,700
Now I'm pissed off.

632
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:56,905
Hide this.

633
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,807
Something is wrong
in Men in Black.

634
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:05,246
What? Vungus, what is this?

635
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:10,150
It's the only thing
that can protect you.

636
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,333
Come on!

637
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:30,037
Where's your fancy
dance moves now?

638
00:43:52,994 --> 00:43:54,896
What the...?

639
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:59,733
Keep your eyes on.
It's not safe.

640
00:43:59,735 --> 00:44:01,869
Eyes on! Eyes on!

641
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:03,070
Two targets!

642
00:44:03,072 --> 00:44:04,740
How is he?

643
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:07,644
He's gone.

644
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:17,854
Guys,
back up a little bit, all right?

645
00:44:30,298 --> 00:44:32,331
Oy!
Outdone yourself here, mate.

646
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,334
- Well done. Well done.
- Thank you.

647
00:44:34,336 --> 00:44:36,235
Fill me in.
What happened, huh?

648
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:38,171
We were attacked,
clearly, C.

649
00:44:38,173 --> 00:44:39,873
- Right.
- By I don't know what.

650
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:42,309
The suspects, they did this
with their bare hands.

651
00:44:42,311 --> 00:44:43,976
They turned solid
into liquid,

652
00:44:43,978 --> 00:44:45,711
- then back again.
- What?

653
00:44:45,713 --> 00:44:48,749
- Why's she here?
- She...

654
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:50,182
- She is
- AGENT H: She is

655
00:44:50,184 --> 00:44:52,186
Walking you
through the crime scene.

656
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:54,722
No, no. She is
a probationary agent,

657
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:57,423
so she is not here
at all, okay?

658
00:44:57,425 --> 00:45:00,193
I think you'll find
that she clearly is here

659
00:45:00,195 --> 00:45:01,327
because I can see her.

660
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:02,729
- Backing you up.
- Thank you.

661
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:04,197
A figure of speech,
but fine.

662
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:05,999
You are in
so much trouble,

663
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:09,369
oh, my God. You had one job.
You had one very simple job:

664
00:45:09,371 --> 00:45:12,171
to take some lizard slimeball
out for a few drinks.

665
00:45:12,173 --> 00:45:14,340
- That was it.
- Not a "lizard slimeball."

666
00:45:14,342 --> 00:45:16,309
- A friend of mine.
- Oh, no.

667
00:45:16,311 --> 00:45:17,878
- Yeah. Sorry about that.
- Mm.

668
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,380
He was
a reptilian slimeball,

669
00:45:19,382 --> 00:45:22,316
now dead because of you.
Who was with him when he died?

670
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:23,784
- I was.
- Who...?

671
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:26,385
Okay, good.
And did he say anything

672
00:45:26,387 --> 00:45:28,322
that might explain why
he was killed?

673
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:30,456
Anything at all?
Come on.

674
00:45:34,195 --> 00:45:35,461
No. Not a thing.

675
00:45:35,463 --> 00:45:38,231
- So just to recap...
- No point.

676
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:39,766
A high-ranking member

677
00:45:39,768 --> 00:45:42,101
of the Jababian royal family
dies on your watch,

678
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:44,403
murdered by assailants
that you can't identify,

679
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:47,007
for reasons that you
cannot begin to fathom.

680
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:48,842
- Is that about right?
- I switched off

681
00:45:48,844 --> 00:45:51,010
the moment you started
talking. I don't know.

682
00:45:51,012 --> 00:45:52,445
Why don't you bugger off.

683
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:54,113
Okay, mate. Thank you.

684
00:45:54,115 --> 00:45:55,249
- Yeah.
- I'll piss off,

685
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:56,916
- to the office.
- Where you belong.

686
00:45:56,918 --> 00:45:58,217
To have a word
with High T,

687
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:00,522
who will not save you
this time.

688
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:04,925
We'll be fine. Okay?
Don't worry.

689
00:46:04,927 --> 00:46:07,864
This is... We'll be fine.

690
00:46:09,164 --> 00:46:10,162
Yeah?

691
00:46:10,164 --> 00:46:13,066
Yes. Yes. Understood.

692
00:46:13,068 --> 00:46:14,469
Yeah... Indeed.

693
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:20,139
Yes.

694
00:46:20,141 --> 00:46:22,242
Yes. Yes.

695
00:46:22,244 --> 00:46:23,546
Thank you.

696
00:46:25,146 --> 00:46:27,280
Let me assure you,
we will deal with this

697
00:46:27,282 --> 00:46:29,885
in the strongest
possible terms.

698
00:46:32,788 --> 00:46:35,121
The Jababians
want your heads.

699
00:46:35,123 --> 00:46:38,425
Quite literally. Both heads,
sent by diplomatic pouch.

700
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:40,930
Okay, um, ahem...

701
00:46:42,297 --> 00:46:43,362
Morning, sir.

702
00:46:43,364 --> 00:46:44,998
I have the forensics report

703
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,365
that you asked for.

704
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:48,334
Thank you.

705
00:46:48,336 --> 00:46:51,104
Well, this is troubling.

706
00:46:51,106 --> 00:46:52,940
- Very troubling.
- Mm-hm.

707
00:46:52,942 --> 00:46:55,378
These are our suspects.

708
00:46:56,844 --> 00:46:59,045
A species called Dyadnum.

709
00:46:59,047 --> 00:47:03,117
From a binary star system
in the constellation Draco.

710
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,950
Draco, that's
Hive territory.

711
00:47:04,952 --> 00:47:06,389
The entire sector
fell years ago.

712
00:47:07,923 --> 00:47:10,090
The Dyads' DNA...

713
00:47:10,092 --> 00:47:12,391
- are riddled with Hive mutations.
- Mm-hm.

714
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:16,128
As we all know, the Hive
doesn't just destroy their enemies,

715
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,231
they subsume them.

716
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:19,999
Take them over from within.

717
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:22,503
Whoever these two were,
they're part of the Hive now.

718
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:25,072
Yes, but why would the Hive
send them all this way

719
00:47:25,074 --> 00:47:26,539
to kill a Jababian royal?

720
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:28,508
You knew Vungus
better than anyone.

721
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,276
Did he indicate
why he was here?

722
00:47:30,278 --> 00:47:31,878
Did he want something
from us?

723
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,615
No, he seemed
pretty normal, happy.

724
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:36,483
Sir. This whole thing
is a fiasco. It's a farrago.

725
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:38,351
And a failure
of this magnitude

726
00:47:38,353 --> 00:47:41,023
requires
immediate invokement of...

727
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,289
Article 13.

728
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:45,458
Don't be a dick.
Who says "farrago"?

729
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,994
Uh, what is Article 13?

730
00:47:47,996 --> 00:47:51,600
Immediate termination,
followed by neuralyzation.

731
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,365
- Wait a second.
- Wait.

732
00:47:53,367 --> 00:47:54,534
- No.
- Is that your answer

733
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:56,436
- to everything?
- Put that away!

734
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:58,005
- Glasses off.
- Sir, you can't.

735
00:47:58,007 --> 00:48:00,173
Give me one good reason
why not.

736
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:02,943
Um, because it's...

737
00:48:02,945 --> 00:48:04,545
what we were talking about.
Um...

738
00:48:04,547 --> 00:48:06,979
- Because...
- Because...

739
00:48:06,981 --> 00:48:09,249
if you erase us,
you will never know the truth.

740
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:11,117
- The truth.
- They're stalling.

741
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,255
- Say the word. I'll do it.
- Put it away.

742
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:16,626
M, go ahead.
Explain yourself.

743
00:48:17,592 --> 00:48:19,662
Well, sir...

744
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:22,898
if you think about it,
really think about it...

745
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:26,398
Vungus...

746
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,601
how many people really knew
that he was here?

747
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:31,237
The people in this room.

748
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:33,539
And perhaps a dozen
high-level agents.

749
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:37,043
If those were the only people
that knew where Vungus would be,

750
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:38,681
and we assume
that Vungus didn't leak

751
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:40,380
his own location
to the killers,

752
00:48:40,382 --> 00:48:43,083
doesn't that mean
that it was someone...

753
00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:44,517
inside MIB?

754
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:47,086
A mole, sir,
inside these very walls.

755
00:48:47,088 --> 00:48:49,322
Sir, they're making this up
as they go along.

756
00:48:49,324 --> 00:48:51,557
"A mole"? In the history
of the company,

757
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:54,494
- there's never been a leak.
- Something a mole would say.

758
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:56,295
- Don't be absurd.
- Classic mole talk.

759
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:57,496
Sounds like Mole 101.

760
00:48:57,498 --> 00:48:59,199
Enough.

761
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:01,101
If we've been compromised,

762
00:49:01,103 --> 00:49:03,070
it puts every citizen
on this planet,

763
00:49:03,072 --> 00:49:05,541
both human and alien,
at risk.

764
00:49:07,376 --> 00:49:09,675
- C. Track down these killers.
- Sir.

765
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:11,677
Find the killers,
we find the mole.

766
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,615
- Will do, sir.
- Dismissed.

767
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:18,320
M, it appears
you're as sharp as advertised.

768
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:21,621
Work the case with C.

769
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:24,057
Get Weapons Department
started on something

770
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:26,062
that can neutralize
these Dyads.

771
00:49:28,496 --> 00:49:29,498
Yes, sir.

772
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:36,003
Sharp indeed she is, sir.

773
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:39,072
I assume you'll want me
overseeing the case? Sort of...

774
00:49:39,074 --> 00:49:41,541
I'm finished covering
for you, H.

775
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:45,278
You need me on this case, sir.
I've dealt with the Hive before.

776
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,380
With nothing but my wits
and my Series 7...

777
00:49:47,382 --> 00:49:51,617
No. He dealt
with the Hive before.

778
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:55,121
And I don't know
where the hell he has gone!

779
00:49:55,123 --> 00:49:57,725
I actually used to think
you could lead this place.

780
00:49:57,958 --> 00:49:59,427
I was wrong about you.

781
00:50:01,028 --> 00:50:03,099
We're done here.

782
00:50:05,634 --> 00:50:07,235
That's an order.

783
00:50:09,003 --> 00:50:11,272
Look, you weren't wrong
about me, sir.

784
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:15,377
You saw something in me once.
It's still there.

785
00:50:16,677 --> 00:50:19,244
And I apologize
for letting you down.

786
00:50:19,246 --> 00:50:22,317
Give me another chance and
I'll fix this. I promise you.

787
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,260
I don't think
it's just a blade.

788
00:50:34,262 --> 00:50:36,229
Looks like it carries
some poison.

789
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:38,164
I know what
you're talking about. Wait.

790
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:39,632
Sorry, mate.
High T wants me

791
00:50:39,634 --> 00:50:42,302
- to run point on this one.
- What? I don't believe you.

792
00:50:42,304 --> 00:50:43,981
I don't like
it any better than you,

793
00:50:44,005 --> 00:50:45,807
but he kept going on
about relying on me,

794
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:48,175
needing our top agent,
that sort of thing.

795
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:50,443
I don't make the rules.
Take it up with him.

796
00:50:50,445 --> 00:50:52,278
M, he's keen for you
to shadow me.

797
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,782
"Learn from the best,"
he said.

798
00:50:54,014 --> 00:50:55,782
Little on-the-job training,
if you will.

799
00:50:55,784 --> 00:50:57,786
Hmm? Yeah?
Come on.

800
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:00,253
- Are you going or you staying?
- Yeah, I'll go.

801
00:51:00,255 --> 00:51:01,420
- Well...
- Okay.

802
00:51:01,422 --> 00:51:03,623
- Come on.
- H?

803
00:51:06,161 --> 00:51:07,163
Thanks
for that.

804
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:10,099
I'm sick of you.

805
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:13,766
Okay.

806
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:15,735
- What's the actual truth?
- You tell me.

807
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:18,271
For someone who hates lying,
that was incredible.

808
00:51:18,273 --> 00:51:19,873
- I wasn't...
- It was electric up there.

809
00:51:20,074 --> 00:51:22,409
The way we played off
each other, back and forth.

810
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:24,309
- I was riffing.
- A mole inside the MIB.

811
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:26,112
It's genius.
I wish I thought of it.

812
00:51:26,114 --> 00:51:27,479
I discovered
a possible truth.

813
00:51:27,481 --> 00:51:29,749
I mean, think about it.
It would explain a lot.

814
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:31,316
What have you got
so far?

815
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:33,485
I was about to run
a molecular deconstruction

816
00:51:33,487 --> 00:51:36,188
on the substance and
cross-reference with all toxins.

817
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,724
- Good idea.
- Just a little science.

818
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:39,293
I wouldn't do that.

819
00:51:39,295 --> 00:51:40,492
Whoo!
I know what that is.

820
00:51:40,494 --> 00:51:42,195
That killed
a 300-pound Jababian,

821
00:51:42,197 --> 00:51:44,130
so I wouldn't get
recreational with it.

822
00:51:44,132 --> 00:51:47,133
Zephos, pure grade. The wrong
amount will kill you instantly.

823
00:51:47,135 --> 00:51:49,269
Right amount will
keep you dancing shirtless

824
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:51,170
on a nightclub in Monaco
for 17 hours.

825
00:51:51,172 --> 00:51:53,706
So much information.
Always so much information.

826
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:56,608
It's what I've heard. There's
only one place in the world

827
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:58,847
where they know how to mix it.
Let's go.

828
00:52:02,516 --> 00:52:04,853
You coming?
World's not gonna save itself.

829
00:52:05,086 --> 00:52:07,454
Are you saying that you need me
to save the world?

830
00:52:07,456 --> 00:52:08,755
Uh-huh.

831
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:09,757
Thought so.

832
00:52:38,653 --> 00:52:39,885
Oh, wow.

833
00:52:39,887 --> 00:52:42,157
You'll see that a lot
around here.

834
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:45,559
It's a
Cromulian tag.

835
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:48,394
In their galaxy, a symbol
for hope or annihilation.

836
00:52:48,396 --> 00:52:50,595
There's still some debate
around what exactly.

837
00:52:50,597 --> 00:52:52,398
Actually,
it's harmony.

838
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,200
But on Earth, it means we're
entering an MIB safe haven.

839
00:52:55,202 --> 00:52:57,115
- How do you know?
- It's in the handbook.

840
00:52:57,139 --> 00:52:58,604
Don't believe
everything you read.

841
00:52:58,606 --> 00:53:01,240
- That is my job.
- And my job is what?

842
00:53:01,242 --> 00:53:02,508
Hang out here and shut up?

843
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,209
Shut up. That's your job.

844
00:53:04,211 --> 00:53:06,311
Well, look who it is. Nasr.

845
00:53:06,313 --> 00:53:08,382
You know the rules:
no visible alien tech

846
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:10,383
anywhere on the street.
Cover the bike up

847
00:53:10,385 --> 00:53:12,719
before I have to give you
a ticket.

848
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:15,354
H? It is really you?

849
00:53:15,356 --> 00:53:17,523
Of course it's me.
Who else could it be?

850
00:53:17,525 --> 00:53:18,858
- Hey, Bassam.
- Hi, H.

851
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,325
Nasr said you were dead.

852
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:21,931
What? I... I never said that.

853
00:53:22,164 --> 00:53:23,896
You did. He's lying.

854
00:53:23,898 --> 00:53:26,432
Aah! Hey! Get...

855
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:28,735
- That's...
- And why would I be dead?

856
00:53:30,871 --> 00:53:33,238
Bassam misunderstood.

857
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,941
We heard that you and Riza
had split up.

858
00:53:35,943 --> 00:53:37,543
Oh, Riza. Who's that?

859
00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:38,980
It's not important.

860
00:53:39,213 --> 00:53:40,412
Mm. Human or...?

861
00:53:40,414 --> 00:53:41,880
- Doesn't matter.
- I'm just curious

862
00:53:41,882 --> 00:53:43,849
how it works
between species, so...

863
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:45,987
Very unimportant.
Old friend of mine, so...

864
00:53:46,221 --> 00:53:48,887
Who runs the biggest criminal
syndicate in the galaxy.

865
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:51,557
Who is a very successful
businesswoman.

866
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:53,360
I love a businesswoman.

867
00:53:53,362 --> 00:53:56,396
- Why are we talking about this?
- Sad. You made a lovely couple.

868
00:53:56,398 --> 00:53:58,430
Thank you.
These things happen.

869
00:53:58,432 --> 00:54:00,867
You said, "That psycho's
gonna slit his throat."

870
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:02,004
Oh, hmm.

871
00:54:02,237 --> 00:54:03,970
Excuse us for one moment.

872
00:54:03,972 --> 00:54:06,271
Your words, not mine.
Don't you...

873
00:54:06,273 --> 00:54:08,974
You dated this person? Seems
like a conflict of interest.

874
00:54:08,976 --> 00:54:11,677
Conflict of interest for you
to know my private life.

875
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:13,313
Yeah, sure.
I'd prefer not to.

876
00:54:13,315 --> 00:54:14,947
Hey, hey,
that's enough. Listen.

877
00:54:14,949 --> 00:54:16,650
Stop beating
the hell out of him.

878
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:18,650
- Yeah.
- Keep this thing covered up.

879
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:20,286
- Absolutely. Will do.
- Thank you.

880
00:54:20,288 --> 00:54:21,720
Won't happen again.

881
00:54:21,722 --> 00:54:23,356
Nice to meet you both.

882
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:24,493
- Yes.
- Yeah.

883
00:54:30,831 --> 00:54:33,499
- What?
- Pulled this

884
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:35,735
from the surveillance
camera outside the club.

885
00:54:35,737 --> 00:54:37,936
Standing there,
making me feel uncomfortable.

886
00:54:37,938 --> 00:54:38,938
Sorry
about that.

887
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:45,378
Have you shown this to T?

888
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,313
You said everything goes
through you.

889
00:54:47,315 --> 00:54:49,347
Yes, everything does go
through me. Good.

890
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:52,019
I'll show him. Go on.

891
00:54:55,456 --> 00:54:57,393
Goodness me.

892
00:54:59,393 --> 00:55:01,029
Oh, boy.

893
00:55:11,773 --> 00:55:13,373
Here comes trouble.

894
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:14,576
I like trouble.

895
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:21,815
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

896
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:22,951
Call Riza.

897
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,755
Ah, here. This is it.

898
00:55:31,827 --> 00:55:34,059
Looks like
a couple days' worth.

899
00:55:34,061 --> 00:55:36,364
No one's been out
to collect.

900
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,440
Hello?

901
00:56:26,481 --> 00:56:30,550
One more step and I'll liquefy
your bangs, pretty boy.

902
00:56:30,552 --> 00:56:31,851
- Easy, easy.
- Okay.

903
00:56:31,853 --> 00:56:34,489
- We don't want any trouble.
- Do not move.

904
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:39,159
Hey, look at you.

905
00:56:39,393 --> 00:56:40,994
What do we call you, sport?

906
00:56:40,996 --> 00:56:42,894
"Sport" is not
what you call me.

907
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:44,164
What is it?

908
00:56:44,398 --> 00:56:46,766
- "It"? He.
- Sorry.

909
00:56:46,768 --> 00:56:48,135
Why would you call me
anything?

910
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:50,503
Pawns don't have names.
We're pawns.

911
00:56:50,505 --> 00:56:54,139
Uh, okay.
"Pawny," then.

912
00:56:54,141 --> 00:56:55,474
What happened here?

913
00:56:55,476 --> 00:56:57,876
Oh, we had the best party.

914
00:56:57,878 --> 00:57:00,546
Kanye showed up
and dropped a whole new album.

915
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:02,648
It was some of his best work.
Look around!

916
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:03,816
We got our asses kicked!

917
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,887
Aah! My queen!

918
00:57:10,123 --> 00:57:11,624
Oh, she's gone.

919
00:57:11,626 --> 00:57:13,825
I'll never serve another.
I swear it.

920
00:57:13,827 --> 00:57:15,494
I'll plunge my dagger

921
00:57:15,496 --> 00:57:18,597
into my own body, like this,
through my vital organs,

922
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,469
and then leave it
until the dark takes me.

923
00:57:22,471 --> 00:57:26,139
Hey, you're not gonna actually
go through with this, are you?

924
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:30,075
Listen. A queen's pawn
without a queen is just a pawn.

925
00:57:30,077 --> 00:57:31,644
A nothing.

926
00:57:31,646 --> 00:57:33,646
I must end my own life

927
00:57:33,648 --> 00:57:37,152
in the most painful way
possible.

928
00:57:38,887 --> 00:57:40,485
Don't stop me.

929
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:43,722
Chance of survival: zero.

930
00:57:43,724 --> 00:57:45,925
- Think we should stop him?
- Gonna do it.

931
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:47,793
Wanna see
if he goes through with it.

932
00:57:47,795 --> 00:57:49,961
- Sorry, what did you say?
- Hmm? Nothing at all.

933
00:57:49,963 --> 00:57:51,597
Know what?
I did say something.

934
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,800
- You did?
- Yeah. He's a witness.

935
00:57:53,802 --> 00:57:55,534
Excuse me.

936
00:57:55,536 --> 00:57:58,537
You know, I don't think
that she would want you to,

937
00:57:58,539 --> 00:58:01,606
you know, go through with it,
honestly.

938
00:58:01,608 --> 00:58:04,911
Who are you to know what
a queen would or wouldn't want?

939
00:58:04,913 --> 00:58:06,679
Are you a queen?

940
00:58:06,681 --> 00:58:09,182
Well, to the extent
that all women are, yes,

941
00:58:09,184 --> 00:58:11,684
but, no, no,
I'm not a queen.

942
00:58:11,686 --> 00:58:14,552
You know what she is,
though, is an agent.

943
00:58:14,554 --> 00:58:16,257
- "Agent"?
- Mm-hm.

944
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,858
- Is that a title?
- It is a title.

945
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,793
A title of great eminence
and stature.

946
00:58:20,795 --> 00:58:22,230
M here is an agent.

947
00:58:22,463 --> 00:58:24,731
An agent without a pawn,
if you see my meaning.

948
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:25,998
I never thought of this,

949
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,166
but maybe the best way
to honor the dead

950
00:58:28,168 --> 00:58:31,037
- is to go on living.
- Yes.

951
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,039
I pledge loyalty eternal to you,
Agent M.

952
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:36,175
No, no, no. I'm not
interested in a subject.

953
00:58:36,177 --> 00:58:38,778
Too late. It's done.
I already pledged the loyalty.

954
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,612
Wish you'd said
"no, no, no" before.

955
00:58:40,614 --> 00:58:41,815
Congratulations.

956
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:44,150
And if you should die
before I,

957
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:46,017
I promise
to end my own life...

958
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:48,755
"In the most painful way
possible."

959
00:58:48,757 --> 00:58:50,923
Yeah. Ha. I don't like you.

960
00:58:50,925 --> 00:58:52,657
Let's go.

961
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:53,860
My lady?

962
00:58:53,862 --> 00:58:56,965
Come on.
We'll have a fun time.

963
00:58:58,231 --> 00:58:59,601
- Fine.
- Yes!

964
00:59:01,936 --> 00:59:04,305
H, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

965
00:59:04,539 --> 00:59:06,671
- I've been wanting to tell you...
- Yeah?

966
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:09,311
- ...about it. Where is it?
- You mean this?

967
00:59:09,543 --> 00:59:11,278
- You stole it from me?
- Stole it from you?

968
00:59:11,512 --> 00:59:13,979
I recovered evidence
you stole from a crime scene.

969
00:59:13,981 --> 00:59:16,715
Vungus told me to hide it and
I couldn't trust anyone.

970
00:59:16,717 --> 00:59:18,717
You're telling me
you listened to Vungus,

971
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:21,655
you trusted Vungus instead of
your partner, a senior agent?

972
00:59:21,657 --> 00:59:22,988
- Huh?
- In a word, yes.

973
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:25,726
H, speaking of agents...

974
00:59:28,096 --> 00:59:29,097
Come on.

975
00:59:30,532 --> 00:59:31,731
Why would they be here?

976
00:59:31,733 --> 00:59:33,599
There's either an award show

977
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:35,601
we're not aware of
or we're in deep shit.

978
00:59:35,603 --> 00:59:38,070
Thank you.
I need you to close every street,

979
00:59:38,072 --> 00:59:39,304
archway and sewer now.

980
00:59:39,306 --> 00:59:41,240
Come in closer
on that body cam there.

981
00:59:41,242 --> 00:59:43,208
- A bit more.
- Could someone

982
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,845
please explain to me
what the hell is going on?

983
00:59:45,847 --> 00:59:47,313
Sir, slightly
sensitive subject.

984
00:59:47,315 --> 00:59:49,014
Thought it best
to keep it quiet.

985
00:59:49,016 --> 00:59:50,983
- A bit further in, please.
- C, a word.

986
00:59:50,985 --> 00:59:54,056
Absolutely. No one leaves
the medina, all right?

987
00:59:55,155 --> 00:59:57,289
This...
This is nonsense.

988
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:58,990
Despite
your personal feelings,

989
00:59:58,992 --> 01:00:01,362
H is one of the best agents
ever to wear this suit.

990
01:00:01,596 --> 01:00:04,063
No, he was one of the best
agents to wear this suit.

991
01:00:04,065 --> 01:00:08,036
He hasn't been the same
since the Hive. Look. Look.

992
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,938
My sources say
that Vungus stole it

993
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,907
from the Jababian War Department
Advanced Research Division

994
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:17,142
and brought it here.

995
01:00:17,144 --> 01:00:19,211
And you kept this from me?
For how long?

996
01:00:19,213 --> 01:00:21,880
- Explain yourself.
- Oh, explain myself?

997
01:00:21,882 --> 01:00:25,952
Sir, whatever that thing is,
M and H had it in your office,

998
01:00:25,954 --> 01:00:27,720
and you let them go, sir.

999
01:00:27,722 --> 01:00:29,891
With all due respect,
you let them go.

1000
01:00:37,164 --> 01:00:41,233
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

1001
01:00:41,235 --> 01:00:43,670
- And, C.
- Sir?

1002
01:00:43,672 --> 01:00:46,037
Bring them
straight to me.

1003
01:00:49,643 --> 01:00:52,010
Whatever that thing is,
Vungus died to protect it.

1004
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:54,715
He gave it to me
so it wouldn't go to them.

1005
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,686
- Yes, sir.
- H, listen to me.

1006
01:01:00,688 --> 01:01:02,155
This isn't my operation.

1007
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:04,990
<i>Get out of there.
Get safe. Then report.</i>

1008
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:06,325
M may be right.

1009
01:01:06,327 --> 01:01:08,260
You, I want sitreps
every 10 minutes.

1010
01:01:08,262 --> 01:01:11,063
There could be
a mole in the Men in Black.

1011
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,374
All right. Take this.
I'll draw them away.

1012
01:01:22,376 --> 01:01:24,943
I'll meet you
at the main square in 20.

1013
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:26,413
Go.

1014
01:01:32,653 --> 01:01:33,922
Hey, guys,
what are the odds?

1015
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:29,342
Nasr!
I need to borrow your bike.

1016
01:02:29,344 --> 01:02:31,242
As long as it is
to borrow, not steal.

1017
01:02:31,244 --> 01:02:32,345
Yes. Of course. Quick.

1018
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:33,815
- Come on.
- Bassam!

1019
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:37,753
Ooh!

1020
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,255
- Okay, accelerator, brake.
- Water.

1021
01:02:42,257 --> 01:02:44,822
- Very hot out there.
- That's very thoughtful of you.

1022
01:02:44,824 --> 01:02:46,258
This is pretty
straightforward?

1023
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,059
Yes. Very
straightforward, indeed.

1024
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:49,994
Just like riding a bike.

1025
01:02:49,996 --> 01:02:51,832
Okay, cool.

1026
01:02:58,974 --> 01:03:00,842
Sorry.

1027
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,085
Well, this is nothing
like riding a bike at all.

1028
01:03:54,996 --> 01:03:55,996
Quick, jump on!

1029
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:00,969
Hold on tight.

1030
01:04:07,007 --> 01:04:09,610
Oh, shit!

1031
01:04:11,846 --> 01:04:13,912
Hold on, Pawny!

1032
01:04:13,914 --> 01:04:16,416
Hold on!

1033
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:18,450
Wait for me!

1034
01:04:18,452 --> 01:04:20,387
Thanks!

1035
01:04:25,827 --> 01:04:28,559
Ha! I can't believe
that actually worked.

1036
01:04:28,561 --> 01:04:30,896
- Hey, H?
- Yeah?

1037
01:04:30,898 --> 01:04:32,398
Oh, right. Glasses.

1038
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,334
Hi, everyone. If you could all
look right here.

1039
01:04:35,336 --> 01:04:37,038
Just drive.

1040
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:50,985
Move! Go!

1041
01:05:08,202 --> 01:05:09,202
Oh, boy.

1042
01:05:11,873 --> 01:05:14,440
What do you think? Red button?
I think it's hyperdrive.

1043
01:05:14,442 --> 01:05:16,075
No, I think
hyperdrive is blue.

1044
01:05:16,077 --> 01:05:18,476
Sometimes you have to
trust your gut.

1045
01:05:18,478 --> 01:05:20,080
My gut, not yours!

1046
01:05:21,449 --> 01:05:24,550
Somebody press something!

1047
01:05:49,543 --> 01:05:52,344
Whoo-hoo!
Lost the tail.

1048
01:05:52,346 --> 01:05:54,112
What'd I tell you, huh?
Hyperdrive.

1049
01:05:54,114 --> 01:05:56,682
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.
- Trust your gut. Trust your gut.

1050
01:05:56,684 --> 01:05:59,083
Oh, God, I hate sand.

1051
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:01,722
The red button was awesome!

1052
01:06:01,956 --> 01:06:03,456
Let's press the red button
again.

1053
01:06:11,065 --> 01:06:13,068
Wow.

1054
01:06:14,702 --> 01:06:15,704
Hey, what's it doing?

1055
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:19,204
Moving.

1056
01:06:29,684 --> 01:06:31,016
Oh.

1057
01:06:31,018 --> 01:06:33,184
What...?
What is that thing?

1058
01:06:33,186 --> 01:06:36,454
See the core?
How it keeps emitting convective energy

1059
01:06:36,456 --> 01:06:38,691
across the interior of
the photosphere?

1060
01:06:38,693 --> 01:06:40,358
Yeah, yeah.
No, I see all of it.

1061
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,595
I see the...
The photosphere bit.

1062
01:06:42,597 --> 01:06:43,765
Okay, yeah. Shh.

1063
01:06:43,998 --> 01:06:46,465
Those are thermonuclear
explosions.

1064
01:06:46,467 --> 01:06:49,369
Wait, what? What does that mean?
Like a bomb or something?

1065
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:53,572
I think what we're looking at
is a super compressed star.

1066
01:06:53,574 --> 01:06:55,340
And by the color
temperature,

1067
01:06:55,342 --> 01:06:59,545
I'd say it's a blue giant.

1068
01:06:59,547 --> 01:07:02,280
Let's press the button.
Let's see what this does.

1069
01:07:02,282 --> 01:07:05,050
Are you suggesting we try
a weaponized star for fun?

1070
01:07:05,052 --> 01:07:07,552
Mm-hm. Well,
for science and fun.

1071
01:07:07,554 --> 01:07:09,521
The two aren't
mutually exclusive. Okay.

1072
01:07:09,523 --> 01:07:10,655
I know.

1073
01:07:10,657 --> 01:07:12,657
Yeah, there is
no better place.

1074
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:15,193
They don't call it
the Empty Quarter for nothing.

1075
01:07:15,195 --> 01:07:17,195
That's why I made
the suggestion. Go.

1076
01:07:17,197 --> 01:07:20,298
Uh, at just .001?
What do you think?

1077
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,200
Yeah. Just start off slow.

1078
01:07:22,202 --> 01:07:23,401
- Press the button.
- Okay.

1079
01:07:30,545 --> 01:07:33,345
Mm. Maybe ratchet it up
a few notches,

1080
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:34,347
a little higher...

1081
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:37,152
Whoa!

1082
01:07:42,356 --> 01:07:44,192
That was the low setting?

1083
01:07:46,092 --> 01:07:50,229
Uh, do we think anyone's gonna
notice that wasn't there before?

1084
01:08:01,442 --> 01:08:04,679
Sir, they got away.

1085
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:09,815
I believe
the appropriate phrase is...

1086
01:08:09,817 --> 01:08:11,316
you lost them.

1087
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:13,488
Well,
I put it to you, sir...

1088
01:08:14,755 --> 01:08:17,656
- ...that they had help.
- Probably.

1089
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:20,791
But I know H. Whatever
he's doing, there's a reason.

1090
01:08:20,793 --> 01:08:22,794
Why do you
keep protecting him?

1091
01:08:22,796 --> 01:08:25,667
Huh? What is it
going to take?

1092
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:29,668
I am protecting
this institution.

1093
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:30,837
From what? From me?

1094
01:08:31,072 --> 01:08:32,670
Are you questioning
my loyalty, sir?

1095
01:08:32,672 --> 01:08:34,809
At the very least,
your judgment.

1096
01:08:38,546 --> 01:08:41,716
Is there anything else,
Agent C?

1097
01:08:44,318 --> 01:08:46,552
- No, sir.
- Good.

1098
01:08:46,554 --> 01:08:48,786
Then would you
kindly leave?

1099
01:09:08,207 --> 01:09:11,544
Vungus knew how powerful
that thing was, right?

1100
01:09:11,546 --> 01:09:14,312
He knew it could destroy worlds,
and he gave it to you.

1101
01:09:14,314 --> 01:09:16,714
I don't understand.
Someone he only just met.

1102
01:09:16,716 --> 01:09:18,219
Why would he do that?

1103
01:09:19,886 --> 01:09:21,452
- I don't know.
- Hmm?

1104
01:09:21,454 --> 01:09:24,889
Maybe he trusted me.

1105
01:09:24,891 --> 01:09:27,593
I'm not gonna doubt
your general trustworthiness,

1106
01:09:27,595 --> 01:09:31,796
but, I mean, I sang
at Vungus' mother's funeral.

1107
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:33,432
Quite beautifully,
I might add.

1108
01:09:33,434 --> 01:09:35,300
We knew everything
about one another.

1109
01:09:35,302 --> 01:09:39,338
I mean, hey, I'm pretty sure
he trusted me. Heh.

1110
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:42,474
Okay, H,
if you must know...

1111
01:09:42,476 --> 01:09:44,442
he said that you'd changed.

1112
01:09:44,444 --> 01:09:47,812
I'm getting sick of hearing
this "you've changed" crap.

1113
01:09:47,814 --> 01:09:49,613
I'm the same person
I was years ago.

1114
01:09:49,615 --> 01:09:51,418
You've always been
this way?

1115
01:09:52,252 --> 01:09:53,419
What way?

1116
01:09:53,421 --> 01:09:55,286
Uh, vaguely inept.

1117
01:09:55,288 --> 01:09:57,923
Arrogant. Reckless.

1118
01:09:57,925 --> 01:10:00,593
- Did I miss anything?
- Heh. Okay, yeah. Hey, look.

1119
01:10:00,595 --> 01:10:02,593
Arrogant and reckless.
That's nice.

1120
01:10:02,595 --> 01:10:04,796
Maybe I am a few
of those things occasionally,

1121
01:10:04,798 --> 01:10:07,799
but my job is saving the planet,
and that's what I do.

1122
01:10:07,801 --> 01:10:10,468
I do a good job at it.
While that's still happening,

1123
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:12,638
the rules are:
there are no rules.

1124
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,542
- Well, that's a rule.
- Mm-hm.

1125
01:10:15,909 --> 01:10:18,910
Argh. Damn it.
All right, nobody move!

1126
01:10:18,912 --> 01:10:21,280
- Drop it, hairball!
- Nobody move.

1127
01:10:21,282 --> 01:10:23,816
- Bassam. How'd you get here?
- Feeling hydrated, H?

1128
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:26,718
Never had a bath before.

1129
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,956
- Lost 2 pounds in dirt alone.
- God, we drank from that.

1130
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:32,523
Oh, God, I thought
it tasted like a living beard.

1131
01:10:32,525 --> 01:10:33,726
Okay, um...

1132
01:10:33,728 --> 01:10:35,826
Bassam, listen,
all right, mate?

1133
01:10:35,828 --> 01:10:37,530
Uh, let's be sensible.

1134
01:10:37,532 --> 01:10:40,000
I don't think you know
what you're dealing with, so...

1135
01:10:40,234 --> 01:10:41,799
Oh, no, I definitely do.

1136
01:10:41,801 --> 01:10:44,402
Which is why she's gonna pay
so much for it.

1137
01:10:44,404 --> 01:10:46,772
- No, wait. Wait, wait!
- No, no, no!

1138
01:10:46,774 --> 01:10:49,474
Have a nice life, bozos!

1139
01:10:49,476 --> 01:10:51,278
Great job, H.

1140
01:10:58,551 --> 01:11:00,988
Pawny, can you ask her
to pass me the torque wrench?

1141
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:04,623
She has a name and a title,
and you know that.

1142
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:07,261
My lady, the jackass wants
a torque wrench.

1143
01:11:08,795 --> 01:11:11,495
Pawny, will you tell him
the sooner he restores power

1144
01:11:11,497 --> 01:11:13,799
to my drive console,
the sooner I can figure out

1145
01:11:13,801 --> 01:11:15,567
- how to program it?
- My lady says

1146
01:11:15,569 --> 01:11:18,603
you're a cloth-brained ass-clown
whose gullible idiocy

1147
01:11:18,605 --> 01:11:20,906
has threatened the very
existence of the planet.

1148
01:11:20,908 --> 01:11:23,342
You know what, she didn't
say that. All right?

1149
01:11:23,344 --> 01:11:24,910
You worst piece
on the chess board.

1150
01:11:24,912 --> 01:11:26,844
- She said that.
- Didn't say any of it.

1151
01:11:26,846 --> 01:11:29,781
Yeah, but I was thinking it.
Actually, every single word.

1152
01:11:29,783 --> 01:11:31,753
You make a really good point.
Thank you.

1153
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:39,860
If you'll tell your lady
she now has power.

1154
01:11:41,561 --> 01:11:43,829
The jackass says, my lady,
that you have power.

1155
01:11:43,831 --> 01:11:46,999
- Can you thank him?
- Really?

1156
01:11:47,001 --> 01:11:48,866
But in a cold,
kind of polite way.

1157
01:11:48,868 --> 01:11:50,769
You can even put a glare
on it.

1158
01:11:50,771 --> 01:11:52,670
Just play around with it.
I trust you.

1159
01:11:52,672 --> 01:11:55,041
My lady says thank you.

1160
01:11:57,944 --> 01:12:00,713
I know where the weapon's going
and how to get it back.

1161
01:12:00,715 --> 01:12:03,348
- My lady?
- I got this one. I'm listening.

1162
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:05,683
Bassam has only one
real buyer:

1163
01:12:05,685 --> 01:12:07,952
Riza Stavros.

1164
01:12:07,954 --> 01:12:10,789
Riza? The Riza
that you went out with?

1165
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:13,525
The intergalactic,
alien arms-dealer Riza?

1166
01:12:13,527 --> 01:12:15,360
I'm gonna hop back in
for a second.

1167
01:12:15,362 --> 01:12:18,429
You dated Riza Stavros,
the Merchant of Death?

1168
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,565
The Mother of Murder?

1169
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:22,768
- She's pretty hot.
- Okay, I didn't know

1170
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:24,836
she was an arms dealer
when we met.

1171
01:12:24,838 --> 01:12:28,109
And I was distracted
by her feminine wiles

1172
01:12:28,341 --> 01:12:30,407
and her
intoxicating beauty.

1173
01:12:30,409 --> 01:12:32,745
And besides, we weren't
interested in labels.

1174
01:12:32,747 --> 01:12:34,478
We were interested
in our hearts.

1175
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,560
If having a big, old heart
is a crime, then shoot me.

1176
01:12:37,551 --> 01:12:39,017
Not yet.

1177
01:12:39,019 --> 01:12:41,389
You'll let me know, though,
right?

1178
01:12:42,588 --> 01:12:44,091
But really?

1179
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:46,627
Your "big, old heart"?

1180
01:12:49,695 --> 01:12:52,732
- What?
- It's just...

1181
01:12:52,734 --> 01:12:55,799
Well, it...?
It's funny, is it? Hmm?

1182
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:57,870
"My big, old heart."

1183
01:12:57,872 --> 01:13:02,543
So stupid. Who talks like that?
Ha-ha-ha. Big, old doofus.

1184
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:07,381
You've never been in love,
have you?

1185
01:13:08,748 --> 01:13:10,815
I'm not making fun.
I'm genuinely asking.

1186
01:13:10,817 --> 01:13:12,953
You've never once
abandoned logic for passion?

1187
01:13:14,988 --> 01:13:18,089
What is this? The sequel to
<i>The Notebook?</i> I never saw it,

1188
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:20,759
but I assume it's a lot
of this type of nonsense.

1189
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:24,728
Heh. No, I haven't.
Passion is unstable,

1190
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:26,598
- and logic is constant.
- Is that right?

1191
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,800
Yeah. Physical attraction
is nothing more

1192
01:13:28,802 --> 01:13:30,701
than chemical reactions
in your brain.

1193
01:13:30,703 --> 01:13:34,039
Can't trust them.
They're not real.

1194
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:37,075
Isn't the whole universe
a chemical reaction?

1195
01:13:37,077 --> 01:13:40,445
Pretty sure
you can trust that.

1196
01:13:40,447 --> 01:13:42,150
Feels pretty real.

1197
01:13:44,885 --> 01:13:47,454
That's actually
kind of deep.

1198
01:13:49,989 --> 01:13:51,792
Well, that should do it.

1199
01:13:55,962 --> 01:13:57,664
Power her up.

1200
01:13:58,465 --> 01:13:59,833
Thank you.

1201
01:14:00,934 --> 01:14:03,768
Pawny. Not there.

1202
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:05,637
That's as
far as I could jump.

1203
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:07,805
I could jump higher, but it
would've been more awkward.

1204
01:14:07,807 --> 01:14:09,543
Okay, enough.

1205
01:14:11,112 --> 01:14:12,547
Here we go.

1206
01:14:15,949 --> 01:14:18,884
And look at that.

1207
01:14:18,886 --> 01:14:21,620
- Well done.
- Mm-hm.

1208
01:14:21,622 --> 01:14:23,822
I know Riza. She may be
the Merchant of Death,

1209
01:14:23,824 --> 01:14:26,558
but she does have
one weakness.

1210
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,960
Ready to be a hero,
little guy?

1211
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:29,230
Pretty open to anything.

1212
01:14:29,462 --> 01:14:31,495
Good, because
we're going to Naples.

1213
01:14:31,497 --> 01:14:34,766
Oh, to Riza's Fortified
Fortress of For Sure Death?

1214
01:15:02,496 --> 01:15:04,265
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

1215
01:15:08,002 --> 01:15:10,634
- Oh. I'm so sorry.
- Oh.

1216
01:15:10,636 --> 01:15:13,037
Can we do this another day?
I have another visitor.

1217
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:14,606
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

1218
01:15:14,608 --> 01:15:15,840
Thank you.

1219
01:15:15,842 --> 01:15:16,840
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1220
01:15:16,842 --> 01:15:18,512
- Bye.
- Bye.

1221
01:15:22,815 --> 01:15:23,982
Luca.

1222
01:15:23,984 --> 01:15:25,552
- Did you miss me?
- No.

1223
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:37,229
H.

1224
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,735
I know why you're here.

1225
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:45,937
Why are you wearing
pink trousers?

1226
01:16:01,755 --> 01:16:03,854
So how have you been?

1227
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:07,125
It's been a while, huh? That's
the tough thing about breakups,

1228
01:16:07,127 --> 01:16:11,095
is the friendships
you lose. Heh. Ahh.

1229
01:16:11,097 --> 01:16:13,165
We had some good times,
though, didn't we?

1230
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:16,902
Riza and I had
good times, I guess.

1231
01:16:16,904 --> 01:16:19,071
You just lurked
in the background a bit.

1232
01:16:28,114 --> 01:16:30,317
Wonderful, isn't she?

1233
01:16:30,551 --> 01:16:32,183
I just love

1234
01:16:32,185 --> 01:16:35,053
dumb,
beautiful creatures.

1235
01:16:41,627 --> 01:16:43,894
Well, this is familiar,
isn't it?

1236
01:16:46,766 --> 01:16:48,334
So...

1237
01:16:48,336 --> 01:16:51,068
MIB finally
showed you the door, eh?

1238
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:52,970
Showed myself out,
actually.

1239
01:16:52,972 --> 01:16:54,673
Oh.

1240
01:16:54,675 --> 01:16:56,741
Some horses are born
to roam free.

1241
01:16:56,743 --> 01:16:59,210
And others just get shot.
What are you doing here?

1242
01:16:59,212 --> 01:17:03,284
I wanted to see you.
And I brought you something.

1243
01:17:05,152 --> 01:17:06,918
I know
how you like special pets,

1244
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,754
so I brought you
a peace offering.

1245
01:17:08,756 --> 01:17:10,054
Meow,
meow.

1246
01:17:10,056 --> 01:17:12,891
Bark, woof,
et cetera, et cetera.

1247
01:17:12,893 --> 01:17:15,126
Oh, I like it.

1248
01:17:15,128 --> 01:17:19,298
He is cute in an ugly
sort of way, isn't he?

1249
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,299
The last
of his kind.

1250
01:17:21,301 --> 01:17:23,968
You always did know the way
to my heart, didn't you?

1251
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:26,972
You always knew how to make mine
beat that little bit faster.

1252
01:17:26,974 --> 01:17:30,208
Not a neuralyzer in the
world could make me forget that.

1253
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:32,009
<i>I was actually looking forward</i>

1254
01:17:32,011 --> 01:17:34,380
<i>to seeing my guns tear you
to pieces, then I saw</i>

1255
01:17:34,614 --> 01:17:38,250
that perfect little face
of yours, and...

1256
01:17:39,752 --> 01:17:40,752
I had to know.

1257
01:17:41,822 --> 01:17:42,822
Know what?

1258
01:17:44,224 --> 01:17:45,690
I want to know the truth.

1259
01:17:45,692 --> 01:17:47,893
- Mm-hm.
- Was this ever real?

1260
01:17:47,895 --> 01:17:49,396
Hmm? This?

1261
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:51,398
<i>You, me? Was it?</i>

1262
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:54,268
This'll be good.

1263
01:17:57,837 --> 01:18:00,104
Was it?

1264
01:18:00,106 --> 01:18:01,906
I knew who you were
from the start.

1265
01:18:01,908 --> 01:18:04,209
My job
was to gain your trust

1266
01:18:04,211 --> 01:18:06,410
and take you down

1267
01:18:06,412 --> 01:18:09,748
when the opportunity came.
That's the truth.

1268
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:11,982
<i>Gotta turn my
earpiece off for this.</i>

1269
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:14,119
God, shut up.

1270
01:18:14,121 --> 01:18:15,753
- What?
- No, I'm sorry.

1271
01:18:15,755 --> 01:18:18,356
It's what I say
to my heart...

1272
01:18:18,358 --> 01:18:20,258
when it's like a voice
inside my head.

1273
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:21,959
Oh, I know.

1274
01:18:21,961 --> 01:18:24,030
I couldn't fake that.

1275
01:18:25,832 --> 01:18:26,865
Thank you.

1276
01:18:26,867 --> 01:18:29,134
It's okay.

1277
01:18:29,136 --> 01:18:31,769
No, but thank you for...

1278
01:18:31,771 --> 01:18:33,204
For giving me closure.

1279
01:18:33,206 --> 01:18:36,174
We all need some...
Some closure from time to time.

1280
01:18:36,176 --> 01:18:38,479
- Get him out of here.
- What...? Wait, no. Hey.

1281
01:18:38,712 --> 01:18:40,344
Wait.
I need some closure too.

1282
01:18:40,346 --> 01:18:43,080
- What about my feelings?
- H, here's a tip for you.

1283
01:18:43,082 --> 01:18:44,949
Next time you bring
a peace offering,

1284
01:18:44,951 --> 01:18:47,285
don't make it the same day
I come into possession

1285
01:18:47,287 --> 01:18:49,287
of the most powerful weapon
ever created.

1286
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:50,988
This has nothing to do
with that.

1287
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:52,389
I didn't know
you had a weapon.

1288
01:18:52,391 --> 01:18:54,258
It's a separate thing.
A coincidence.

1289
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:57,128
Total coincidence. Didn't know
she had a weapon. Did you?

1290
01:18:58,998 --> 01:19:00,331
Take him
to the boat.

1291
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:03,104
All right.
Okay, okay, okay.

1292
01:19:08,408 --> 01:19:10,375
Fellas,
I think that went pretty well.

1293
01:19:10,377 --> 01:19:13,445
Looks like we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

1294
01:19:39,005 --> 01:19:41,039
Okay.

1295
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:42,543
Okay, okay, okay. Shh...

1296
01:19:43,943 --> 01:19:45,509
Sebastian, darling.

1297
01:19:45,511 --> 01:19:47,478
How would you like
to be able to destroy

1298
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,080
entire solar systems
without leaving your home?

1299
01:19:50,082 --> 01:19:51,884
<i>- Pawny?</i>
- Yeah, I see it.

1300
01:19:51,886 --> 01:19:53,821
Uh...

1301
01:19:55,387 --> 01:19:58,091
Oh, would you look at that.
Good to go, M.

1302
01:20:01,028 --> 01:20:03,128
Okay, Pawny,
it's all on you now.

1303
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:06,196
Okay, that kind of pressure
is not constructive.

1304
01:20:06,198 --> 01:20:09,202
It's very simple, darling.
Do you want it or not?

1305
01:20:10,436 --> 01:20:12,538
No, I only have one,
Sebastian,

1306
01:20:12,773 --> 01:20:14,108
and I won't have that
for long.

1307
01:20:15,309 --> 01:20:17,107
No, I'm gonna give you
five seconds.

1308
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:18,875
Perfectly done.

1309
01:20:18,877 --> 01:20:19,877
Whoop.

1310
01:20:22,082 --> 01:20:23,317
I'm going to call you back.

1311
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:26,116
Crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

1312
01:20:26,118 --> 01:20:27,451
Look at your little legs.

1313
01:20:27,453 --> 01:20:28,453
You are so fast.

1314
01:20:30,023 --> 01:20:31,889
Why, look at you run.

1315
01:20:34,261 --> 01:20:35,559
You're so fast!

1316
01:20:35,561 --> 01:20:37,264
Wait, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

1317
01:20:43,336 --> 01:20:46,507
Now, you don't run away again.
Oh, hello.

1318
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:51,576
Oh, and here I thought...

1319
01:20:51,578 --> 01:20:53,214
H worked alone.

1320
01:20:54,314 --> 01:20:56,981
Silly me.

1321
01:20:56,983 --> 01:20:59,250
Poor you.

1322
01:20:59,252 --> 01:21:02,120
It's been a steep
learning curve, yeah.

1323
01:21:05,257 --> 01:21:07,991
Oh, that? That's a snub-nosed
Karzig annihilator.

1324
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:11,197
Do you know what that does
to a human body?

1325
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:16,003
It boils you
from the inside out.

1326
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,137
Cute.

1327
01:21:19,271 --> 01:21:20,640
Do you know what
a Pawny does

1328
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:22,941
to sadistic
alien arms-dealers?

1329
01:21:22,943 --> 01:21:25,143
No, honey.
Tell me what a Pawny is.

1330
01:21:25,145 --> 01:21:27,348
I'm a Pawny,
you psycho!

1331
01:22:14,261 --> 01:22:16,230
Looks like
the tables have turned.

1332
01:22:18,564 --> 01:22:20,197
That was an incredible catch.

1333
01:22:56,168 --> 01:22:57,304
That felt good.

1334
01:23:06,445 --> 01:23:09,281
Don't worry. Don't worry.
It's all part of the plan.

1335
01:23:09,283 --> 01:23:11,585
Well, H, you always have been
rather delusional.

1336
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,360
Peace offering.

1337
01:23:22,362 --> 01:23:24,161
Kill them.

1338
01:23:24,163 --> 01:23:27,197
Start with him
and make it hurt.

1339
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:29,735
No! You don't have
to do this.

1340
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:33,103
Put me down,
you Tarantian thug.

1341
01:23:33,105 --> 01:23:35,040
Wait.
Did you say "Tarantian"?

1342
01:23:35,042 --> 01:23:36,777
- Yes.
- Yes, my lady, he did.

1343
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:39,611
They tend to be single-minded
when it comes to killing.

1344
01:23:39,613 --> 01:23:41,379
Brains the size
of a pistachio nut.

1345
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:42,379
Okay, shh.

1346
01:23:42,381 --> 01:23:43,683
You're not helping.

1347
01:23:46,653 --> 01:23:49,588
The creature you saw was
an unlicensed Tarantian

1348
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:51,222
from Andromeda II.

1349
01:23:51,224 --> 01:23:53,057
Tarantian?

1350
01:23:56,595 --> 01:23:58,396
I know a Tarantian.

1351
01:23:58,398 --> 01:23:59,466
I met one once.

1352
01:24:00,533 --> 01:24:01,533
I helped him.

1353
01:24:03,036 --> 01:24:04,335
<i>Kabla nakshulin.</i>

1354
01:24:06,206 --> 01:24:07,206
What?

1355
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:10,709
<i>Kabla nakshulin?</i>

1356
01:24:10,711 --> 01:24:13,111
- What she said.
- How do you know that?

1357
01:24:13,113 --> 01:24:14,481
Because he said it to me.

1358
01:24:21,587 --> 01:24:22,687
Molly?

1359
01:24:22,689 --> 01:24:24,254
Yes.

1360
01:24:24,256 --> 01:24:27,259
Molly? Are you shitting me?
Really?

1361
01:24:29,395 --> 01:24:31,495
Who's delusional now?

1362
01:24:31,497 --> 01:24:32,498
It's you?

1363
01:24:37,069 --> 01:24:38,335
You've grown.

1364
01:24:38,337 --> 01:24:40,340
I mean, me too.

1365
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:44,844
Give her the box.

1366
01:24:45,078 --> 01:24:47,477
Luca,
you can't do this.

1367
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:49,113
Haven't I been good to you?

1368
01:24:49,115 --> 01:24:52,150
I've let you kill anyone
you wanted.

1369
01:24:52,152 --> 01:24:53,284
Come on.

1370
01:24:53,286 --> 01:24:54,587
No?

1371
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:58,824
The box.

1372
01:25:03,262 --> 01:25:05,362
Thank you.

1373
01:25:05,364 --> 01:25:07,430
You changed my life,
by the way. Heh, heh.

1374
01:25:07,432 --> 01:25:09,201
Hey, uh, quickly.

1375
01:25:09,203 --> 01:25:11,738
<i>Kabla nakshulin,</i>
what does it mean?

1376
01:25:12,771 --> 01:25:14,205
It means:

1377
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:16,708
"One day,
I'll kill whoever you choose

1378
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:18,645
in the most gruesome way
imaginable."

1379
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:22,881
Or maybe we just
keep her here for a moment

1380
01:25:23,115 --> 01:25:25,817
until he and I can discuss
a plan of action.

1381
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:27,718
H? H, are you okay?

1382
01:25:29,355 --> 01:25:30,890
I'm good.

1383
01:25:32,391 --> 01:25:34,491
That was...
That was a rush.

1384
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:36,294
Yeah,
and incredibly painful.

1385
01:25:36,296 --> 01:25:37,794
- Yeah.
- Pretty sure the plan

1386
01:25:37,796 --> 01:25:39,597
went wrong in
every conceivable way.

1387
01:25:39,599 --> 01:25:40,599
Yeah, well...

1388
01:25:42,536 --> 01:25:45,471
So, uh,
it's Molly, huh?

1389
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,638
You're not supposed
to know that.

1390
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,241
Well, too late.
I know it now.

1391
01:25:50,243 --> 01:25:52,343
Guess it's only fair
that you know mine.

1392
01:25:52,345 --> 01:25:53,879
- I don't wanna know.
- I'll tell you.

1393
01:25:53,881 --> 01:25:55,379
- Okay.
- You ready?

1394
01:25:55,381 --> 01:25:56,513
Horatio.

1395
01:25:56,515 --> 01:25:58,851
- It is not.
- It's not.

1396
01:26:00,185 --> 01:26:01,320
It's Henry.

1397
01:26:02,521 --> 01:26:03,821
Yeah, you look like
a Henry.

1398
01:26:03,823 --> 01:26:06,357
- Good. It's all I've got.
- I'm Steve.

1399
01:26:06,359 --> 01:26:09,360
Steve? I thought you said
pawns didn't have names.

1400
01:26:09,362 --> 01:26:11,795
We don't.
I was just feeling left out.

1401
01:26:11,797 --> 01:26:13,498
Oh, Steve.

1402
01:26:21,541 --> 01:26:22,609
Whoa...

1403
01:26:24,243 --> 01:26:25,643
Wha...?

1404
01:26:25,645 --> 01:26:26,645
That is not cool.

1405
01:26:30,817 --> 01:26:33,351
I don't like what
the earth is doing now.

1406
01:26:33,353 --> 01:26:34,652
No, no, no.

1407
01:26:40,894 --> 01:26:42,429
<i>Kabla nakshulin!</i>

1408
01:26:45,265 --> 01:26:46,729
It was worth a try.

1409
01:26:46,731 --> 01:26:49,969
We must have the
weapon, for the Hive.

1410
01:26:50,203 --> 01:26:52,336
No. I don't know if
you've heard,

1411
01:26:52,338 --> 01:26:54,608
but we are
the Men in Black.

1412
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:58,712
The Men and Women
in Black.

1413
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,545
Nice save.

1414
01:27:02,547 --> 01:27:04,348
If you think
we'll hand this over,

1415
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:05,583
you've got
another think coming.

1416
01:27:05,585 --> 01:27:06,851
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

1417
01:27:06,853 --> 01:27:08,318
See, we protect the Earth.

1418
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,786
Everyone and everything on it.

1419
01:27:09,788 --> 01:27:11,789
So you wanna do this?
You wanna get down?

1420
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:13,460
Fine. Let's go.

1421
01:27:17,463 --> 01:27:19,597
Move, and I'll obliterate
this entire island

1422
01:27:19,599 --> 01:27:20,801
and everything on it.

1423
01:27:22,969 --> 01:27:25,969
Including us. You don't think
we should've spoken about this?

1424
01:27:25,971 --> 01:27:27,472
I just gave a whole speech.

1425
01:27:27,474 --> 01:27:28,873
Yeah, I liked the speech.

1426
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:30,976
I just thought
this would be more effective.

1427
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:32,943
You heard me.
Don't make me use it.

1428
01:27:32,945 --> 01:27:35,615
We'll do anything
to protect our world.

1429
01:27:40,286 --> 01:27:41,520
So will we.

1430
01:27:58,404 --> 01:28:01,039
Nothing in this universe
is unkillable.

1431
01:28:01,274 --> 01:28:03,607
With the proper voltage.

1432
01:28:03,609 --> 01:28:05,442
Are you both
all right?

1433
01:28:05,444 --> 01:28:07,711
Yes, sir.
Never better.

1434
01:28:07,713 --> 01:28:10,317
- Sir, how did you find us?
- Experience.

1435
01:28:11,717 --> 01:28:12,983
Riza again, H?

1436
01:28:12,985 --> 01:28:15,620
When are you
going to learn?

1437
01:28:18,024 --> 01:28:19,557
I knew
I could count on you.

1438
01:28:19,559 --> 01:28:21,491
That, in the end,
you'd pull through.

1439
01:28:21,493 --> 01:28:22,927
Thank you, sir.

1440
01:28:22,929 --> 01:28:24,661
You too, M.

1441
01:28:24,663 --> 01:28:27,000
Agent O had a feeling
about you, and she was right.

1442
01:28:32,704 --> 01:28:34,604
The universe has a way
of leading you

1443
01:28:34,606 --> 01:28:36,407
to where
you're supposed to be...

1444
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:38,845
At the moment
you're supposed to be there.

1445
01:28:41,715 --> 01:28:42,783
Let's go home.

1446
01:28:55,328 --> 01:28:57,661
Let's keep this safe,
shall we?

1447
01:28:57,663 --> 01:29:00,565
Saunder,
inform the Jababian embassy,

1448
01:29:00,567 --> 01:29:02,536
we have the weapon.

1449
01:29:06,405 --> 01:29:09,840
Quite the first assignment
for a probationary agent, M.

1450
01:29:09,842 --> 01:29:14,012
Marrakesh,
the Empty Quarter, Naples.

1451
01:29:14,014 --> 01:29:16,817
Imagine what you will accomplish
when you're one of us.

1452
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:20,884
- Yes, sir.
- Enjoy this moment, M.

1453
01:29:20,886 --> 01:29:23,356
They never last.

1454
01:29:28,595 --> 01:29:30,760
I don't know how you do
it, but you keep doing it.

1455
01:29:30,762 --> 01:29:32,796
Yeah? What's that, C?

1456
01:29:32,798 --> 01:29:33,964
Well, saving the world

1457
01:29:33,966 --> 01:29:36,633
from total destruction
twice...

1458
01:29:36,635 --> 01:29:37,735
in as many years.

1459
01:29:37,737 --> 01:29:39,103
I mean...

1460
01:29:39,105 --> 01:29:41,104
- what are the odds?
- What are the odds?

1461
01:29:44,077 --> 01:29:45,709
MIB!

1462
01:29:48,447 --> 01:29:49,850
Right.

1463
01:29:52,652 --> 01:29:53,920
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1464
01:29:59,057 --> 01:30:00,127
- Hey.
- Hey.

1465
01:30:00,359 --> 01:30:01,525
How's it going?

1466
01:30:01,527 --> 01:30:02,927
- Uh, you know.
- Cool party, huh?

1467
01:30:02,929 --> 01:30:05,095
- Yeah, great party.
- Something is wrong.

1468
01:30:05,097 --> 01:30:06,865
That's what
I was thinking.

1469
01:30:06,867 --> 01:30:09,634
I said to the Dyads we'd
do anything to save our world.

1470
01:30:09,636 --> 01:30:11,503
- They said that they would too.
- Mm-hmm.

1471
01:30:11,505 --> 01:30:14,472
Then they told us they needed
the weapon for the Hive.

1472
01:30:14,474 --> 01:30:16,473
What if we misunderstood
what that meant?

1473
01:30:16,475 --> 01:30:18,942
Maybe they needed the weapon
to use against the Hive

1474
01:30:18,944 --> 01:30:21,012
- to save their world.
- Mm-hmm.

1475
01:30:21,014 --> 01:30:23,580
Which could mean they were
never the Hive at all.

1476
01:30:23,582 --> 01:30:25,150
Uh-huh.

1477
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:28,119
But the DNA, the mutations.
High T showed us that sample.

1478
01:30:28,121 --> 01:30:30,854
All right. Let's see.

1479
01:30:30,856 --> 01:30:33,557
Agent H, bring up
the Dyad forensic report.

1480
01:30:37,697 --> 01:30:40,464
Who has the authority
to make a case file disappear?

1481
01:30:40,466 --> 01:30:41,902
Come with me.

1482
01:30:51,778 --> 01:30:55,146
And what about Naples?
How did he know we were there?

1483
01:30:55,148 --> 01:30:56,613
He was doing his job.

1484
01:30:56,615 --> 01:30:58,648
Does his job
include tracking us?

1485
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:01,787
He gave this to me as a gift.
It has a chip inside it.

1486
01:31:03,622 --> 01:31:06,490
We need to see the confiscated
Jababian weapon.

1487
01:31:06,492 --> 01:31:07,958
Not possible.

1488
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,195
Not possible? I'm the
senior agent on the case.

1489
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,562
Let's make it possible.
Where's the weapon?

1490
01:31:19,137 --> 01:31:22,039
I think he's been chasing it
the entire time.

1491
01:31:22,041 --> 01:31:23,942
High T is the mole.
He's gotta be.

1492
01:31:23,944 --> 01:31:25,876
A mole for who?
Where would he take it?

1493
01:31:25,878 --> 01:31:26,910
Paris.

1494
01:31:26,912 --> 01:31:28,978
My guess would be Paris.

1495
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:31,848
I knew all along
that something was off.

1496
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:33,584
I thought
he was covering for you,

1497
01:31:33,586 --> 01:31:34,919
but it turns out,
it was him.

1498
01:31:34,921 --> 01:31:36,521
He was hiding
his own tracks.

1499
01:31:36,523 --> 01:31:38,656
Gotta be an explanation.
M, come on.

1500
01:31:38,658 --> 01:31:40,090
- I'm coming with you.
- No, C.

1501
01:31:40,092 --> 01:31:42,826
Hey, hey. Come on, now.
This isn't about you.

1502
01:31:42,828 --> 01:31:44,230
I know. I agree.

1503
01:31:44,463 --> 01:31:46,996
Listen, if it turns out
what you're saying is true

1504
01:31:46,998 --> 01:31:48,566
and word gets out that T,

1505
01:31:48,568 --> 01:31:50,768
the most decorated agent
in MIB history,

1506
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:53,273
is a traitor,
the agency will never recover.

1507
01:31:53,506 --> 01:31:55,606
If we stop him,
no one ever has to know.

1508
01:31:55,608 --> 01:31:58,174
But what if
you can't stop him? Then what?

1509
01:32:00,011 --> 01:32:02,079
Well, then
tell them it was me.

1510
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:03,915
Tell them
I was the traitor.

1511
01:32:03,917 --> 01:32:05,752
Trust me,
the agency will believe you.

1512
01:32:08,921 --> 01:32:09,921
You.

1513
01:32:17,096 --> 01:32:19,265
Oh, that's right.
That happened.

1514
01:32:31,109 --> 01:32:32,875
That's what
I'm talking about.

1515
01:32:32,877 --> 01:32:34,111
I'm driving.

1516
01:32:34,113 --> 01:32:35,916
Uh...

1517
01:32:41,554 --> 01:32:43,254
That really
should be here.

1518
01:32:43,256 --> 01:32:44,787
Not in this country.

1519
01:32:59,037 --> 01:33:01,138
There should be
a big red button somewhere.

1520
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:03,174
Yes!
Press the red button.

1521
01:33:03,176 --> 01:33:04,176
Found it.

1522
01:33:07,881 --> 01:33:08,881
Whoa!

1523
01:33:24,162 --> 01:33:26,332
<i>H, you gotta see this.</i>

1524
01:33:26,565 --> 01:33:28,766
<i>A portal from Sector C
has been activated.</i>

1525
01:33:28,768 --> 01:33:30,034
The Hive.

1526
01:33:30,036 --> 01:33:31,837
<i>I'm sending you backup. Out.</i>

1527
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:37,308
You remember when I told you
we're in the lying business?

1528
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:38,843
Mm-hmm.

1529
01:33:38,845 --> 01:33:40,777
T said that to me
when he recruited me.

1530
01:33:40,779 --> 01:33:42,679
He said,
"We have to lie to the world,

1531
01:33:42,681 --> 01:33:44,815
which means we can never lie
to each other."

1532
01:33:44,817 --> 01:33:46,317
I just don't believe
that he has.

1533
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:48,785
But you can't always
trust your gut, H.

1534
01:33:48,787 --> 01:33:50,853
Sometimes things are
as they appear to be.

1535
01:33:50,855 --> 01:33:52,889
No, we saved the world,
for God's sakes.

1536
01:33:52,891 --> 01:33:54,691
Together,
with nothing but our wits

1537
01:33:54,693 --> 01:33:56,029
and our Series-7
De-Atomizers.

1538
01:33:57,095 --> 01:33:58,163
So I've heard.

1539
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,435
- H?
- Yeah?

1540
01:34:35,667 --> 01:34:37,768
Mind telling me
one more time?

1541
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:38,872
How'd you beat the Hive?

1542
01:34:40,073 --> 01:34:41,838
Uh, it was
three years ago.

1543
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,443
High T and I
went to face the Hive

1544
01:34:43,676 --> 01:34:47,143
with nothing but our wits and
our Series-7 De-Atomizers. Cool?

1545
01:34:47,145 --> 01:34:48,812
Yes, but how'd you do it?

1546
01:34:48,814 --> 01:34:50,281
Wait. What are you doing?

1547
01:34:50,283 --> 01:34:52,316
- I'm curious. How'd you do it?
- I told you.

1548
01:34:52,318 --> 01:34:54,418
- You didn't, though.
- I did a few times.

1549
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:57,088
Okay, High T and I went up
to face the Hive

1550
01:34:57,090 --> 01:35:00,126
with nothing but our wits
and our Series-7 De-Atomizers...

1551
01:35:06,231 --> 01:35:08,965
Am I...?
I'm repeating myself, aren't I?

1552
01:35:08,967 --> 01:35:10,867
- Over and over.
- Word for word.

1553
01:35:10,869 --> 01:35:13,771
Yeah, um... Okay,
why would I be doing that?

1554
01:35:13,773 --> 01:35:16,109
H, I don't think that you beat
the Hive that night.

1555
01:35:17,176 --> 01:35:19,112
I think you were neuralyzed.

1556
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,433
Ah. You came to say goodbye.

1557
01:35:43,435 --> 01:35:45,371
And you brought the lovely M.

1558
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:49,475
You can really feel
the history here.

1559
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:52,276
Eiffel
discovering wormholes,

1560
01:35:52,278 --> 01:35:54,812
gangways to
other civilizations,

1561
01:35:54,814 --> 01:35:57,751
the First Alien Migration.

1562
01:35:59,251 --> 01:36:02,919
And we made history here too,
didn't we, H?

1563
01:36:02,921 --> 01:36:05,923
With just our wits
and our Series-7 De-Atomizers.

1564
01:36:05,925 --> 01:36:08,259
No. We didn't.

1565
01:36:08,261 --> 01:36:11,497
The Hive wanted the most
powerful weapon in the galaxy,

1566
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:14,298
so you had Vungus bring it
to Men in Black.

1567
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:16,799
You'd wait. When it came,
you'd give it to them.

1568
01:36:16,801 --> 01:36:20,937
My dear boy, you were always
a bright one...

1569
01:36:20,939 --> 01:36:22,973
but there's no stopping this.

1570
01:36:22,975 --> 01:36:26,343
With the weapon out of the way,
every planet will fall,

1571
01:36:26,345 --> 01:36:28,178
starting with this one.

1572
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:29,882
Step away from the controls.

1573
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:33,017
You neuralyzed me.

1574
01:36:33,019 --> 01:36:36,254
Made me a hero,
the guy that saved the world.

1575
01:36:36,256 --> 01:36:38,455
Left alive to sell the lie.

1576
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,395
They wanted this.

1577
01:36:43,996 --> 01:36:45,064
You were there.

1578
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,901
You were always
like a son to me.

1579
01:36:49,903 --> 01:36:51,067
H?

1580
01:36:51,069 --> 01:36:54,071
You were always
like a son to me.

1581
01:36:54,073 --> 01:36:55,541
That's not High T anymore.

1582
01:36:55,774 --> 01:36:57,040
You were always
like a son

1583
01:36:57,042 --> 01:36:58,143
to him.

1584
01:37:14,525 --> 01:37:15,960
Shoot it! Shoot it!

1585
01:37:20,466 --> 01:37:22,299
My queen!

1586
01:37:22,301 --> 01:37:23,933
I'm coming!

1587
01:37:38,117 --> 01:37:39,950
What do we do?
What do we do?

1588
01:37:57,269 --> 01:37:58,637
I'm gonna get it back.

1589
01:37:58,871 --> 01:38:00,940
I know he's still
in there somewhere.

1590
01:38:02,274 --> 01:38:03,574
Hey!

1591
01:38:03,576 --> 01:38:06,479
Hey! I know
you're in there somewhere!

1592
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:12,383
It's me, H.

1593
01:38:12,385 --> 01:38:15,121
Remember, you wanted me
to take your place.

1594
01:38:19,425 --> 01:38:20,557
M!

1595
01:38:25,497 --> 01:38:28,098
<i>The truth of the universe.</i>

1596
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:29,569
I want to know
how it all works.

1597
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:33,638
The universe has a way
of leading you

1598
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,272
to where you're
supposed to be.

1599
01:38:37,176 --> 01:38:39,512
<i>At the moment
you're supposed to be there.</i>

1600
01:38:41,881 --> 01:38:44,584
My queen!

1601
01:38:51,122 --> 01:38:53,259
I'm not losing another queen.

1602
01:39:05,069 --> 01:39:07,572
You said
I was like a son to you.

1603
01:39:08,974 --> 01:39:11,511
You were like
a father to me.

1604
01:39:14,947 --> 01:39:15,947
H.

1605
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:36,402
Right time...

1606
01:39:37,536 --> 01:39:38,668
right place.

1607
01:40:02,994 --> 01:40:03,994
Pawny?

1608
01:40:05,264 --> 01:40:08,365
- Yeah?
- You've served your queen well.

1609
01:40:08,367 --> 01:40:10,232
Thank you, my lady.

1610
01:40:10,234 --> 01:40:12,037
It was my honor.

1611
01:40:48,774 --> 01:40:51,340
So is she as tough as they say?

1612
01:40:51,342 --> 01:40:52,778
In a word, yes.

1613
01:40:54,546 --> 01:40:57,112
- Well, you didn't screw up.
- No, ma'am.

1614
01:40:57,114 --> 01:41:00,183
Let's be honest,
there were a few bumps along the way,

1615
01:41:00,185 --> 01:41:02,318
- friction at the start...
- Let's not be honest.

1616
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:05,222
Okay. No,
we did not screw up.

1617
01:41:05,224 --> 01:41:08,558
You said there may be a problem
in London, but you knew.

1618
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,760
I hadn't trusted London branch
for some time.

1619
01:41:10,762 --> 01:41:13,265
I never understood
the reason why.

1620
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,333
T lived for
this organization.

1621
01:41:16,335 --> 01:41:19,204
He was the very best
we had to offer. He will be...

1622
01:41:23,542 --> 01:41:25,474
...missed.

1623
01:41:28,579 --> 01:41:30,613
Welcome to the circus,
Agent M.

1624
01:41:30,615 --> 01:41:33,185
You are no longer
probationary.

1625
01:41:35,554 --> 01:41:37,856
Well, there you go.
My work here is done, I...

1626
01:41:38,090 --> 01:41:39,790
- You are.
- I'm sorry, what?

1627
01:41:39,792 --> 01:41:41,827
Probationary head
of London branch.

1628
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,160
I'm sorry.
Probationary head?

1629
01:41:44,162 --> 01:41:48,165
It sounds like I got promoted
and demoted at the same time.

1630
01:41:48,167 --> 01:41:50,836
No. Try and cope.

1631
01:41:51,069 --> 01:41:53,570
Several years ago, before
all this, T mentioned to me

1632
01:41:53,572 --> 01:41:56,440
a young, up-and-coming
field agent who had certain

1633
01:41:56,442 --> 01:41:58,208
leadership qualities,
shall we say.

1634
01:41:58,210 --> 01:41:59,744
Was his faith in you
misplaced?

1635
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:02,580
No, I just think
there are

1636
01:42:02,582 --> 01:42:04,714
far more experienced
agents than myself.

1637
01:42:04,716 --> 01:42:07,317
Yeah, there are.
But you have the full support

1638
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:09,687
of our senior staff
and, by the way, Agent C.

1639
01:42:09,689 --> 01:42:11,624
Is that right?

1640
01:42:16,729 --> 01:42:19,562
- Do I take it you accept?
- Yes.

1641
01:42:19,564 --> 01:42:21,498
Good. I'll talk to
the bosses upstairs.

1642
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,232
You need to clear
your London desk

1643
01:42:23,234 --> 01:42:25,835
and report to MIB
in New York on Monday.

1644
01:42:25,837 --> 01:42:27,739
New York.

1645
01:42:29,307 --> 01:42:30,473
Thank you, Agent O.

1646
01:42:33,479 --> 01:42:34,880
Congratulations,
probie.

1647
01:42:35,113 --> 01:42:36,883
Congratulations to you too.

1648
01:42:41,487 --> 01:42:43,786
You'll want to
brief your agents.

1649
01:42:43,788 --> 01:42:45,423
Walk with me.

1650
01:42:47,592 --> 01:42:50,660
So you wanted to know
how it all works.

1651
01:42:50,662 --> 01:42:52,394
Now you do.

1652
01:42:52,396 --> 01:42:56,568
And as you will no doubt
have divined, Agent M,

1653
01:42:57,569 --> 01:42:59,472
there's a price.

1654
01:43:38,677 --> 01:43:40,376
Nope.

1655
01:43:40,378 --> 01:43:42,611
Hey there.
What are you doing?

1656
01:43:42,613 --> 01:43:43,982
I told O I had to
take care of

1657
01:43:44,216 --> 01:43:45,781
a couple things
before I went back.

1658
01:43:45,783 --> 01:43:47,483
Yeah? What,
like stealing my car?

1659
01:43:47,485 --> 01:43:49,820
No, like driving it.

1660
01:43:49,822 --> 01:43:51,620
You're on the right side,
at least.

1661
01:43:51,622 --> 01:43:52,722
I'm a quick study.

1662
01:43:52,724 --> 01:43:54,357
Give me a lift
back to London?

1663
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:55,761
Road trip.

1664
01:43:59,463 --> 01:44:01,298
Up, up, up!

1665
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:03,266
Oh, God.
Did not need that.

1666
01:44:03,268 --> 01:44:05,735
Could you zap me with
that forgetting thing, please?

1667
01:44:05,737 --> 01:44:07,470
What are you doing here,
Pawny?

1668
01:44:07,472 --> 01:44:08,974
Get used to seeing me,
pretty boy.

1669
01:44:09,207 --> 01:44:11,308
- I'm your new babysitter.
- He's my new what?

1670
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:12,843
- Babysitter.
- Queen's orders.

1671
01:44:12,845 --> 01:44:14,710
She says the chance
of your sorry ass

1672
01:44:14,712 --> 01:44:16,647
surviving without me:
Zero.

1673
01:44:16,649 --> 01:44:18,714
Okay, I did not say that...
exactly.

1674
01:44:18,716 --> 01:44:20,317
She said, "Slim to zero."

1675
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:21,584
I rounded it down to zero

1676
01:44:21,586 --> 01:44:22,988
because
I feel like it's zero.

1677
01:44:23,221 --> 01:44:24,687
Consider it a parting gift.

1678
01:44:24,689 --> 01:44:26,456
Come on.
I saved the world.

1679
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:28,991
You couldn't tell because
you were getting choked out.

1680
01:44:28,993 --> 01:44:30,794
- Do I even have a choice?
- No.

1681
01:44:30,796 --> 01:44:33,763
Yes! There we go. All right.
Where's that little red button?

1682
01:44:33,765 --> 01:44:34,930
Oh, it's right here.

1683
01:44:34,932 --> 01:44:36,299
Whoa!

1684
01:44:36,301 --> 01:44:37,800
I still don't like you.

1685
01:44:37,802 --> 01:44:38,902
I love that option.

1686
01:44:45,944 --> 01:44:48,745
This is a complicated piece
of machinery, so be careful.

1687
01:44:48,747 --> 01:44:49,946
Yeah, got it.

1688
01:44:49,948 --> 01:44:51,384
I'm gonna trust my gut.
