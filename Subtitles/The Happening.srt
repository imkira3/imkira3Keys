2
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:40,143
I forgot where I am.

3
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:41,895
You're at the place
where the killers meet

4
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,106
to decide what to do
with the crippled girl.

5
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:46,650
Oh, that's right. That's right.

6
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:56,034
Did you hear that?

7
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:00,205
That's funny.

8
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:05,669
That's weird. Those people look
like they're clawing at themselves.

9
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:08,213
Is that blood?

10
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:31,236
Claire, are you seeing this?

11
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,696
Claire.

12
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:35,365
Claire?

13
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,368
Claire?

14
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,454
What page was I on?

15
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,501
Page.

16
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:15,155
- I need an extension over here.
- Fall back. Fall back.

17
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:16,406
You kidding me?
Like another 20 feet.

18
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:19,076
Don't touch that.
That's for the drywall guys.

19
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:20,327
I told you he wouldn't do it!

20
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:21,912
So then the little guy says,

21
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,500
"You have a girlfriend named Wendy, too?
Well, I saw your thing and it said 'WY'."

22
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:31,922
The big guy says, "No, man, mine says,
'Welcome to Jamaica, have a nice day."'

23
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,224
Christ, McKenzie fell.

24
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,236
Medic, we have a major accident
at the south side of the building.

25
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,363
- We'll need an ambulance.
- Copy.

26
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,074
Jesus.

27
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:01,702
Give him some room.

28
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:07,457
- Hey!
- Somebody fell!

29
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,668
- Davis?
- Oh, my God, he just fell!

30
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:13,296
Someone fell! Over that building!

31
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:18,260
Oh, my God!

32
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,386
- Watch it.
- Oh, my God!

33
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:21,305
Watch it. Get out of there!

34
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:27,269
- Help!
- Look out!

35
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:30,605
Look out!

36
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:43,618
God in heaven.

37
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:47,331
Look, I don't know if you guys
have heard about this article

38
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:49,333
in The New York Times
about honeybees vanishing?

39
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:53,795
Well, apparently, honeybees are
disappearing all over the country.

40
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:56,173
Tens of millions of them.
Just disappearing.

41
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:59,760
There's no bodies, no sign of them.
They're just mysteriously gone.

42
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:01,928
It's scary, huh?

43
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:06,475
All right, let's hear some theories
about why this might be happening.

44
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:08,685
Nothing? Come on, guys.

45
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:12,481
- Laura.
- Disease?

46
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:15,484
Right. Could be a virus or infection.

47
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:18,445
But it's all over the country.
It's a coordinated event in 24 states.

48
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:20,947
It's a little tricky.

49
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:22,532
- Pollution?
- Could be.

50
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,035
I mean, we're just pumping
so much junk into the environment

51
00:07:25,118 --> 00:07:26,745
they're just keeling over.

52
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:29,998
But there are no bodies. Keep guessing.

53
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:31,583
Dylan.

54
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,919
Global warming.

55
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:37,839
Temperature goes up a fraction of a
degree, makes them disoriented?

56
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,132
Maybe.

57
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:43,095
Jake?

58
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:46,640
You don't have an opinion?

59
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:50,936
You're not interested
in what happened to the bees?

60
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:53,480
You should be more interested
in science, Jake.

61
00:07:53,563 --> 00:07:57,234
You know why?
Because your face is perfect.

62
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:01,071
The problem is,
your face is perfect at 15.

63
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:03,323
Now, if you were interested in science,
you would know facts

64
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:06,535
like the human nose and ears
grow a fraction of an inch each year.

65
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:08,078
So a perfect balance of features now

66
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:10,664
might not look so perfect
five years from now.

67
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:14,292
They might look downright whack
10 years from now.

68
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:18,171
Come on, buddy.
Take an interest in science.

69
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:21,341
What could be a reason
the bees have vanished?

70
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,474
An act of nature and
we'll never fully understand it.

71
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,810
Nice answer, Jake.

72
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,395
He's right.

73
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:36,523
I mean, science will come up
with some reason to put in the books,

74
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,900
but in the end, it'll be just a theory.

75
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:44,197
We will fail to acknowledge that there are
forces at work beyond our understanding.

76
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,199
To be a good scientist,

77
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:49,870
you must have a respectful awe
for the laws of nature.

78
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:51,079
Jake?

79
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:53,206
How much does the human nose
grow each year?

80
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,833
- Oh, man.
- It's minuscule, buddy, okay?

81
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,169
Don't worry about it. You're gonna
be a heartthrob your whole life.

82
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:59,463
I was just messing with you.

83
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,554
The Dark Lord.
Don't look into her eyes.

84
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:15,354
Vice Principal!
What can we do for you?

85
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:19,358
I'm afraid I have to interrupt you
for a moment, Mr. Moore.

86
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,402
Okay, guys, calm down.
I'll be right back.

87
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,947
- What is that?
- I can't believe it.

88
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,116
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

89
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:31,078
- I've never seen anything like it before.
- What's going on?

90
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,371
I don't know.

91
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:35,499
You excused all the teachers?

92
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,251
The administration makes us teach
with a foot of snow on the ground.

93
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:39,878
What is this?

94
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:43,131
- They stopped class.
- Elliot!

95
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,343
All right.

96
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:50,055
There appears to be an event happening.

97
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:54,935
Central Park was just hit by
what seems to be a terrorist attack.

98
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,353
Oh, no.

99
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:59,481
They're not clear on the scale yet.

100
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:01,817
It's some kind of
airborne chemical toxin

101
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,070
that's been released
in and around the park.

102
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:07,864
They said to watch
for warning signs.

103
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:10,909
The first stage
is confused speech.

104
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:15,622
The second stage is physical
disorientation, loss of direction.

105
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:18,500
The third stage is fatal.

106
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,878
Central Park? That's kind of odd.

107
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:26,133
I spoke with the head of schools.
He said we should dismiss the students.

108
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,137
So take your planners home
so we can get back when this is over.

109
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,889
All right? Let's do our jobs.

110
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,769
Hey, you guys still got to work on
your science projects for next week.

111
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,105
What are the rules of
scientific investigation?

112
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,650
Identify variables.
Design the experiment.

113
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:48,530
Careful observation and measurement.
Interpretation of experimental data.

114
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:51,325
Hey, guys?

115
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,121
Nothing.

116
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:04,004
Alacrity. With alacrity, please.

117
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:08,884
My mother just called my cell again.
She's hysterical. Hysterical.

118
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:13,639
I told her the probability of something
happening in Philadelphia is very low.

119
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:16,266
I mean, nobody's telling us
to leave the city, right?

120
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,811
So I threw some figures at her.
It's good to be a math teacher sometimes.

121
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:23,148
You know, people are comforted
by percentages. Didn't work.

122
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:25,484
She still wants us to get out of
the city and come out to her house.

123
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:28,153
But she said for
you and Alma to come.

124
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:29,946
Yeah, let me think
about that, okay?

125
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:32,699
Did you hear about New York?

126
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:34,368
Are you okay?

127
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:36,662
No, I mean, are you okay?

128
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:39,331
Yeah, me, too.
Listen, I want to talk about it more.

129
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:41,500
Julian's mom offered for all of us to
get out of the city and stay with her.

130
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,668
What do you think?

131
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:47,631
Yo, Chris!

132
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:51,468
I'll bring Jess and Evette
and I'll meet you at the station.

133
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,055
Listen, Julian, if Alma's acting
weird, just be cool, okay?

134
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:56,223
What's going on?

135
00:11:56,306 --> 00:12:00,268
She's acting odd.
Just don't worry about it, okay?

136
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:01,728
Odd?

137
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:05,732
Look, if she's acting like
she's distant or something...

138
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:07,484
What?

139
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:09,611
I can't say any more.

140
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,321
Is she leaving you?

141
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:15,367
I didn't say that. It's just talk, okay?
Just relax, please?

142
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:18,537
Hey.

143
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:23,375
I'm going to tell you something you
should never tell your best friend.

144
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,711
Why is everybody saying that?

145
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,046
I saw her on your wedding day.

146
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,382
Again with the wedding. What?

147
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:34,386
I walked into a waiting room by mistake,
and she was crying.

148
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:37,264
She looked up. I saw her face.

149
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:40,600
She wasn't ready to jump in, Elliot.
That's not who she is.

150
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:44,104
She's never going to jump in
when you need her, man.

151
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:48,358
So do federal, state and local
officials have a plan in place

152
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:49,484
for this type of catastrophe?

153
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:53,030
Are they utilizing all the
manpower or the money...

154
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:23,018
- Hi.
- Are you packed?

155
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,811
- Yes.
- What are they saying?

156
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:27,397
They're evacuating New York City.

157
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:31,902
Well, our brains come equipped
with a self-preservation mechanism

158
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:34,112
to stop us from harmful actions.

159
00:13:34,237 --> 00:13:38,450
This is controlled by a combination
of electrochemical signals in the brain.

160
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:42,120
The blocking of neurotransmitters
by certain toxins

161
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:46,708
has been proven to cause hallucinations,
asphyxiation and paralysis.

162
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:51,088
This new neurotoxin is basically
flipping the preservation switch,

163
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:54,174
blocking neurotransmitters
in a specific order,

164
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:58,261
causing specific self-damaging
and catastrophic effects.

165
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:00,681
Just how the toxin works
and who the terrorists are...

166
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,891
It makes you kill yourself.

167
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,771
Just when you thought there couldn't be
any more evil that could be invented.

168
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:10,148
I'll be packed in two minutes.

169
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,519
Hello?

170
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:59,406
- No need to rush.
- Sir. Thank you.

171
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:02,117
Sir, we need to check your suitcase.

172
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,662
Elliot! Elliot! Elliot!

173
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,419
This just in to the Eyewitness News
room and this is the latest development.

174
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:17,341
Autopsies on the first victims confirm
the toxin is a natural compound.

175
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:21,595
The attacks remain confined
to the New York metropolitan area.

176
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,221
This is a very,
very disturbing story...

177
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:25,724
Track three now
boarding for Harrisburg.

178
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:27,934
Hey, Jess. Where's Evette?

179
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,937
She was at a shop across town,
she got stuck in traffic.

180
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:32,731
- She's gonna take the next train.
- We'll wait.

181
00:15:32,814 --> 00:15:34,650
No, no, no. She wanted us
to get on this train with Jess.

182
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,817
She'll feel a lot safer.

183
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,944
- Where's Alma?
- Restroom.

184
00:15:40,364 --> 00:15:41,573
Hey, Julian!

185
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:44,451
Please have your tickets out and ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

186
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:45,911
I bought them.

187
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:48,038
It was like getting one
of those Cabbage Patch Dolls

188
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,748
when they first came out.

189
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:51,583
Madhouse. How are you?

190
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,919
- Good. You?
- Good.

191
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,800
- Okay, good. Why don't we all...
- I'm really glad you chose to come.

192
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:05,931
Thanks. Elliot, can I
talk to you for a second?

193
00:16:06,014 --> 00:16:07,140
Yeah.

194
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,145
Please show me your tickets,
ladies and gentlemen.

195
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,482
- You told him about our fight?
- No.

196
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,818
- Why did he say that?
- He guessed.

197
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:21,446
I love you, Elliot, but I don't like to put
my feelings out there for everyone to see.

198
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:23,615
I'm not that type of person.

199
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:26,118
Elliot, these are our problems.

200
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:30,288
I am upset.
I'm going to sit alone and cool off.

201
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:32,749
By the time we get there I'll be fine.
Is that okay?

202
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,042
Fine.

203
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,217
I'm going to get on the train.

204
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,845
We're not gonna
get to sit together anyways.

205
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:46,179
Okay.

206
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,144
Hey, babe.

207
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:54,354
- Hi, Aunt Alma.
- How you doing?

208
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,857
- Hanging in there.
- Me, too.

209
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:03,071
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

210
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:05,741
You're wrong about her.
She just needs time to figure it out.

211
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,242
Come on, don't get all sensitive.

212
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,162
- Just give her a chance.
- Okay, fine. If you don't want my help...

213
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:12,497
- I don't want your help!
- Okay. I heard it.

214
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,792
Jess, could you ask your dad
for my ticket, please?

215
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:18,920
Thank you.
I'll see you on the train, Jess.

216
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:23,008
Track 3 now boarding
all ticketed passengers.

217
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:24,468
Here we go.

218
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,679
When will Mom meet us at Grandma's?

219
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:31,767
Mommy's gonna get on the next train.
You know how she's always late.

220
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,921
- Come on. Come on. I know. I know.
- Mom.

221
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,727
- Chilly, isn't it today, Sal?
- Maybe a little.

222
00:19:23,086 --> 00:19:26,757
Hey, it's me. I'm on a train.
I just want to say something, okay?

223
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,383
You've got to stop calling me.

224
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,469
You're acting like the
Fatal Attraction guy, here.

225
00:19:30,594 --> 00:19:32,763
I feel like I'm
going to take a shower

226
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:35,974
and see your silhouette
on the shower curtain.

227
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,270
We ate tiramisu together,
that is it.

228
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:44,399
I told you that would be it.
You have got to chill out.

229
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,236
What?

230
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:51,448
When?

231
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:53,158
In Philadelphia?

232
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:57,788
- I don't know. What did you hear?
- Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

233
00:19:58,205 --> 00:19:59,331
What's the news?

234
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:02,376
Apparently Philadelphia
was just attacked.

235
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:06,755
- Oh, my God. Evette.
- Call Mommy. Call Mommy!

236
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,138
Honey!

237
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,474
Honey...
Yeah, yeah, where are you?

238
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,435
What? What?
I can't hear you.

239
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:24,690
I said I can't hear you!
Text me.

240
00:20:25,565 --> 00:20:27,859
Text me. I can't hear you!

241
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:31,488
They think it started
in Rittenhouse Square Park.

242
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:33,240
Another park?

243
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:41,540
- She got on a bus going to New Jersey.
- I want to talk to her.

244
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:44,334
I know, baby. I know. She got out.
She's headed to the town of Princeton.

245
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:46,336
I want to talk to her.

246
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,100
- Do you have a phone?
- No, I'm sorry.

247
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:04,271
- You okay?
- They say Boston got hit, too.

248
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:07,149
- Where'd you hear that?
- A friend from work. What about Evette?

249
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,192
Oh, God. She made it out on a bus.

250
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:11,862
What the hell is going on, Elliot?

251
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,158
I honestly don't know.

252
00:21:41,642 --> 00:21:42,976
Now what?

253
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:45,896
It just stopped. I don't know.

254
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,898
- Can't go nowhere.
- They're not telling us anything.

255
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,359
- Well, until we hear from...
- Sir?

256
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,943
Train service has
been discontinued.

257
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:55,364
This will be the last stop
for all passengers.

258
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,283
Hey! What do you mean?
Where are we?

259
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:01,286
Filbert, Pennsylvania.

260
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:04,581
Filbert?
Does anybody know where that is?

261
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:07,501
Why are you giving me one useless
piece of information at a time?

262
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:09,294
What's going on?

263
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:12,589
Hey, why would you just stop?
You can't just leave us here.

264
00:22:12,673 --> 00:22:16,093
Sir, we lost contact.

265
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,594
With whom?

266
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,598
Everyone.

267
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:26,645
I'm scared. I don't like it here.
I want Mom.

268
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:29,564
Don't be silly.
We're safe here, okay?

269
00:22:33,694 --> 00:22:36,822
Sorry. She whispers to us
when she gets scared.

270
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:42,869
We're so much the same, Jess.
I don't like to show my emotions, either.

271
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:45,497
She's shivering.

272
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,166
I know. I know.
She's never right without her mom.

273
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:49,376
It's okay.

274
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:51,044
They're not saying anything.

275
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:52,879
We're stuck here.

276
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,466
Is Jess okay?

277
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,302
She's not talking.

278
00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:03,181
We're in a small town, Jess.
Nothing will happen to us here.

279
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,693
Don't know what you want?

280
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,528
Then just have the grilled cheese
plain with milk, okay?

281
00:23:16,653 --> 00:23:17,738
Come on, come over here.

282
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:18,947
No, you know what?
Why don't you stay here?

283
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,825
Stay here, all right?
You can see me from over there.

284
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,993
What?
All right, you want to come with me?

285
00:23:23,076 --> 00:23:24,828
You can come with me and wait in line.
You want to do that?

286
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:27,706
Bro! Bro, I got it.
Go get the milk.

287
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:30,792
All right, yeah. Okay.

288
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:39,009
You know that everyone
gives off energy, right?

289
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,094
It's scientifically proven.

290
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,305
They got these cameras
that can record what color you are

291
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,265
when you're feeling different things.

292
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:49,811
People that are angry give off a
different color than people that are sad.

293
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,521
See this ring?

294
00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:55,525
This ring can supposedly tell you
what you're feeling.

295
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:58,528
Let's see what
you're feeling right now.

296
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:07,037
Yellow! That's cool.
That means you're about to laugh.

297
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,873
I'm not making it up.
That's what yellow means.

298
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,375
You must be about
to laugh or something.

299
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:14,503
It's probably just
about to come out.

300
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:16,129
We'll wait.

301
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:18,924
We got all day.

302
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:26,932
Oh, my God. There it is! Cool.
That ring really works. That's amazing.

303
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:30,102
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look at this.

304
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:32,354
My sister sent it to me.

305
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:35,816
It was taken an hour ago
at the Philadelphia Zoo.

306
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,476
Mother of God,
what kind of terrorists are these?

307
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:29,870
They're not sure it's terrorists now.

308
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,830
Moments ago,
in an official statement,

309
00:25:31,913 --> 00:25:34,374
the government moved away
from its initial position

310
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,501
that this was a
terrorist attack.

311
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:37,919
Authorities are now feeling,

312
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,505
by the sheer number
of incidents being reported,

313
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:45,677
that a terrorist group being responsible
is becoming less and less likely.

314
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:48,430
The event appears to be
limited to the Northeast,

315
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,642
where smaller and smaller towns
are being attacked.

316
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:52,768
Where are we?

317
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,770
The infected area now
includes most of New England,

318
00:25:54,895 --> 00:25:56,688
from Massachusetts to Maryland.

319
00:25:56,813 --> 00:25:58,023
We're dead center.

320
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:02,402
Everything okay?

321
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,000
If we stay here,
we are gonna die here.

322
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:25,092
Whatever this is, it looks like it's
not occurring about 90 miles from here.

323
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:28,345
Let's go.

324
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,935
Anyone got a car?
Can anyone give us a ride?

325
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,366
Hey!

326
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:00,127
Excuse me, sir?

327
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,503
Sir, could we get a ride, please?

328
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:03,880
We don't have any transportation.
We're stuck here.

329
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:06,425
Sir, did you hear what I said?
We don't have any transportation!

330
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:09,386
- We have a little girl with us. Please.
- Drive. Just roll up the window.

331
00:27:09,469 --> 00:27:12,264
Sir! You're not just going to...

332
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:19,521
Can you believe
how crappy people are?

333
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:26,445
There's a car.

334
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:30,741
Hi. I run a plant
nursery up the street.

335
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:33,744
We're picking up a few things from home,
then heading

336
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,705
wherever this isn't happening.

337
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,873
We have room.

338
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:39,708
- We have two others.
- That's okay.

339
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,544
Julian!

340
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,088
Is Julian okay?

341
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:55,766
We got a ride. He can fit all of us.

342
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:59,770
Elliot, I can't get Evette on
the phone or e-mail or nothing.

343
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:02,439
- How long?
- It's been about two hours.

344
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:05,400
She was on that
bus headed to Princeton.

345
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,820
There's a car over there headed
to pick up friends and family,

346
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:11,698
they said they
could squeeze one more.

347
00:28:13,617 --> 00:28:15,118
We got to go.

348
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:19,206
Look, think real carefully about this.

349
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,124
She was looking
for a birthday present for Jess.

350
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:24,878
Some kind of dollhouse.
That's why she wasn't with us.

351
00:28:24,962 --> 00:28:27,130
I'm just gonna go get her
and I want to bring her back,

352
00:28:27,214 --> 00:28:29,967
and then I'm gonna find you guys.

353
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,678
I just...
I need you to take Jess, okay?

354
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,306
She's gonna be
a lot safer with you.

355
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,517
Don't do this to me.

356
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:42,020
I'm doing my best
here not to fall down.

357
00:28:43,313 --> 00:28:46,817
I'm sure the probability of
Princeton not being hit is good.

358
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,943
Yeah.

359
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:49,861
You want me to throw some
figures and percentages at you

360
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:51,113
so we both feel better?

361
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,031
- Please.
- All right.

362
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:57,202
62% chance.
62% chance it hasn't even been hit.

363
00:28:57,327 --> 00:28:59,413
- Well, you go get her, Jules, okay?
- Of course, man, of course.

364
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:00,998
Come on.
This is all some weird event, that's all.

365
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:05,043
We're all gonna be fine.
I'm gonna find you guys real soon.

366
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:08,505
I have to go.

367
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:10,716
I got her, Julian.

368
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:14,136
Don't take my daughter's hand
unless you mean it.

369
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,893
I'm going to go get Mommy.

370
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:24,688
Hold our picture.

371
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:22,454
Take a look around.
We'll be ready in a jiffy.

372
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,140
We're packing
hot dogs for the road.

373
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:44,726
You know, hot dogs get a bad rap.

374
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,562
They've got a cool shape,
they've got protein.

375
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,690
You like hot dogs, right?

376
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:55,070
By the way,
I think I know what's causing this.

377
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,116
- You do?
- It's the plants.

378
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:01,451
They can release chemicals.

379
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:05,998
You like hot dogs, don't you?

380
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:14,673
Okay, babies, we are gonna be going,
but we will be back soon, okay?

381
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:20,762
Oh, plants react to human stimulus.
They've proved it in tests.

382
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:27,185
Did you get the mustard?

383
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:14,441
Don't look outside. Stop it!

384
00:32:14,524 --> 00:32:17,861
Stop it! Just look at me!
Just keep looking at me!

385
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,616
Close the vents.

386
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:32,084
I'm gonna give you a math riddle, okay?
And you're gonna tell me the answer.

387
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,377
What?

388
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:39,174
How much would you have if I said
I would pay you a penny on the first day

389
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,927
and then two pennies on the second,
and then four pennies on the third day

390
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:44,012
and I just kept doubling it
and I did this for a month?

391
00:32:44,137 --> 00:32:47,349
How much money would you have
at the end of the month?

392
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,811
- Ten dollars.
- No, higher. Higher, higher.

393
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:54,106
Just keep looking at me.
Just keep looking at me.

394
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:57,234
Twenty dollars?

395
00:32:57,317 --> 00:32:59,569
No, keep going. Keep going.

396
00:33:08,704 --> 00:33:12,082
Thirty. It's thirty. It's $30.

397
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:24,469
I'm gonna tell you the answer.

398
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:27,139
It's over $10 million.

399
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:30,684
You'd have over $10 million
at the end of the month.

400
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,274
You want to hear another one?

401
00:34:38,251 --> 00:34:41,338
Water contamination has surfaced
as one of the many theories

402
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:46,259
being taken seriously as to the cause
of the events in the Northeast.

403
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:48,512
We have to go through
this little community of homes.

404
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:50,681
Small town called Holcomb,
then we hit the highway.

405
00:34:50,847 --> 00:34:54,101
From there,
we're 30 miles from the state line.

406
00:34:57,145 --> 00:34:59,690
Are those dead animals up ahead?

407
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:03,902
Stop the car.

408
00:35:09,366 --> 00:35:12,077
- You don't think it's...
- I don't know.

409
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,915
You got binoculars in the back, from
when you were spying on our neighbors.

410
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,678
Can I have the map?

411
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,555
Elliot...

412
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:33,473
Don't cause a panic, okay?
Jess can hear you.

413
00:35:33,557 --> 00:35:35,892
It's bodies, isn't it?
I knew it would be bodies.

414
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,060
How could it not be bodies?

415
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:39,396
Please, give me the map.

416
00:35:51,908 --> 00:35:53,368
Well, we have to turn around.

417
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,370
There's a right turn
about a quarter of a mile back.

418
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:58,957
We're just gonna take a different route,
honey, okay?

419
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:21,647
Oh, it's the Army. We're safe!

420
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:31,698
My name is Private Auster.

421
00:36:31,782 --> 00:36:35,494
I'm stationed at West Dover Military Base,
about 10 miles back.

422
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:37,496
I think they've been affected
by whatever's happening.

423
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:39,456
I lost communication with them.

424
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:40,624
When I approached the base,

425
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:46,338
I saw military personnel
in the barbed wire, in the fence.

426
00:36:46,421 --> 00:36:47,839
So I suggest no one take that road.

427
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:49,591
There's a town
about eight miles behind us.

428
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:52,511
There were bodies on the road into town.

429
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:56,598
Cheese and crackers.

430
00:36:57,474 --> 00:37:00,519
Well, that still
leaves us two directions.

431
00:37:03,897 --> 00:37:06,900
Just stop! Stop the vehicle!

432
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,820
- What's going on?
- Is everyone all right?

433
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:11,697
We have no communication with anybody.

434
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,701
- I'll talk to them.
- Did you see anything out of the ordinary?

435
00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:19,871
Hello! Please stop!

436
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:22,541
Excuse me.

437
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:29,548
Who's Joey?

438
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,466
Oh, it's no one.

439
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:36,513
Any luck?

440
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,223
I can't get Julian
on his cell phone.

441
00:37:38,348 --> 00:37:41,518
I'm sure he'll be all right.
They'll be okay.

442
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:45,605
Has anyone seen any other people
on the roads?

443
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:48,108
Maybe he's on to something.

444
00:37:49,526 --> 00:37:53,071
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

445
00:37:53,155 --> 00:37:55,282
Why did it start in parks?

446
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:58,619
It's the same story.
About eight, nine miles back.

447
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,413
They say there's a bus in a lake.

448
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:07,252
Five miles back.
There were dozens of bodies.

449
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:16,386
Okay.

450
00:38:17,137 --> 00:38:21,975
Nobody's going anywhere.
We're gonna stay right here for a while.

451
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:33,445
There's a woman
talking to her daughter.

452
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:35,030
She's talking to her
daughter in Princeton.

453
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:37,324
Isn't that where your friend went?

454
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:38,867
Come on.

455
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,751
It's okay.
Honey, it's okay.

456
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:49,836
She's so scared.

457
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,133
You just stay in that room.
You don't open the door for nothing.

458
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:57,469
Just keep watching out the window
with the tree, baby.

459
00:38:57,552 --> 00:38:59,137
Someone will come and get you soon.

460
00:38:59,221 --> 00:39:02,516
Tell her not to go near the window
with the tree. Just tell her.

461
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:04,518
Baby, don't go near the window
with the tree.

462
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:06,228
Ask her if Princeton's been affected.

463
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:10,649
Honey, someone wants to know
if Princeton's had any problems.

464
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:16,071
She says everyone's dead outside.

465
00:39:17,114 --> 00:39:19,616
You just stay in your room.

466
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:21,910
Honey?

467
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,580
Honey, you're talking funny.
What's wrong with you?

468
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:28,333
- What do you mean? Everyone's dead?
- What?

469
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:31,962
Stacy... Stacy, you're scaring me.

470
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:35,048
I don't understand what you're saying.

471
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,301
What, baby?

472
00:39:37,426 --> 00:39:40,429
She's just not making any sense.

473
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,014
Calculus.

474
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:45,017
I see in calculus.

475
00:39:45,976 --> 00:39:47,477
Calculus.

476
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,646
- Stacy!
- Calculus.

477
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,273
Stacy!

478
00:39:53,317 --> 00:39:54,943
Stacy Ann!

479
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:56,737
Oh, my God.

480
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:03,035
- I hear wind from outside.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

481
00:40:03,118 --> 00:40:05,954
Stacy, Stacy, Stacy.

482
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:10,250
Oh, no!

483
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,310
We're going to go back to the car,
okay, Jess?

484
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,902
If we went down that road,
where would that take us?

485
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,877
I walked down a quarter mile,
it was clean.

486
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:39,881
I can't tell you what's after that,
but it was clean, no bodies, no nothing.

487
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:42,592
- Quarter mile?
- That's not enough.

488
00:41:42,676 --> 00:41:45,595
Hey, it's better than going back
the other way.

489
00:41:46,096 --> 00:41:50,475
Get a battle plan.
Everybody makes a clean break.

490
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:52,936
Elliot's resilient, isn't he?

491
00:41:55,397 --> 00:41:57,607
Yeah. He never gives up.

492
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:03,071
You know, plants have the ability
to target specific threats.

493
00:42:03,155 --> 00:42:05,782
Tobacco plants,
when attacked by Heliothis caterpillars

494
00:42:05,907 --> 00:42:10,871
will send out a chemical attracting
wasps to kill just those caterpillars.

495
00:42:10,954 --> 00:42:12,623
We don't know how plants
attain these abilities.

496
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:16,001
They just evolve very rapidly.

497
00:42:16,126 --> 00:42:20,297
Which species do you think is
doing it if you think it's true?

498
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,675
Plants have the ability to communicate
with other species of plants.

499
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:25,636
Trees can communicate with bushes,

500
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:28,805
bushes with grass
and everything in between.

501
00:42:30,766 --> 00:42:34,519
The radio says these attacks
started happening in the cities

502
00:42:34,603 --> 00:42:37,147
then went to the towns
and now the roads.

503
00:42:37,314 --> 00:42:38,857
That's right.

504
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,778
Whatever's happening is happening
to smaller and smaller populations.

505
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:44,905
So we shouldn't be on the roads, then.

506
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:49,034
The terrorists, or whatever
could be watching the roads.

507
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,499
I don't have any reason
to disagree right now.

508
00:42:57,668 --> 00:42:59,753
We are in the area of attack.

509
00:42:59,836 --> 00:43:03,340
If you can't find a way
through the area of attack

510
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:08,428
we are told to find a safe zone
within the area being attacked.

511
00:43:08,512 --> 00:43:11,098
They're attacking populations.

512
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:13,892
We need to go where there
aren't that many people.

513
00:43:14,017 --> 00:43:16,103
Where people don't travel.

514
00:43:16,186 --> 00:43:20,816
Now this is Mr. Collins.
He's a realtor that works in this area.

515
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:25,570
If we go west,
we'll hit a county called Arundell.

516
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:27,197
It's not on that map.

517
00:43:27,322 --> 00:43:32,119
It would only be on local maps. Dirt roads.
Hardly anybody lives out there.

518
00:43:32,995 --> 00:43:37,165
There's no significant population there.
That's our safe zone.

519
00:43:37,249 --> 00:43:41,920
We wait it out there till it's over.
Is everyone in agreement?

520
00:43:44,673 --> 00:43:46,300
We should go into two groups.

521
00:43:46,425 --> 00:43:48,093
Those that are
ready to go right now

522
00:43:48,218 --> 00:43:50,595
and those that need
to get things from their cars.

523
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:54,182
We need to stay in groups.
Stay together.

524
00:43:57,185 --> 00:43:59,730
We'll go soon, honey.
We'll go soon.

525
00:44:03,984 --> 00:44:05,319
Maybe we should've waited
for the rest of them,

526
00:44:05,402 --> 00:44:08,572
stayed in a big group,
like the Private said.

527
00:44:09,323 --> 00:44:11,199
Your phone's out, too?

528
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,121
What's wrong?

529
00:44:17,623 --> 00:44:19,916
Okay. I was going to tell you, okay?

530
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:22,377
There was this guy, Joey.

531
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:23,795
His name is Joey.
He's at work.

532
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:25,505
We went out and we had dessert.

533
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:28,383
I went out and I had dessert with him
when I told you I worked late.

534
00:44:28,467 --> 00:44:29,718
And I didn't work late.

535
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,637
I'm feeling really guilty
in case we're gonna die.

536
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,139
I just wanted you to know that.

537
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:37,559
You lied to me?

538
00:44:48,445 --> 00:44:51,114
- How much farther is it?
- I don't know.

539
00:45:02,626 --> 00:45:04,795
- We need to keep going forward.
- Who the hell made you boss?

540
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,715
Look, if y'all follow him, y'all gonna die.
You follow me, you're gonna live.

541
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:12,928
I'm in charge of this group!
Ain't nobody else in charge of this group!

542
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:17,474
My firearm is my friend!
It will not leave my side!

543
00:45:18,475 --> 00:45:20,102
Private Auster?

544
00:45:23,438 --> 00:45:25,732
My firearm is my friend.

545
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:03,812
Jesus.

546
00:46:08,108 --> 00:46:09,735
Oh, no.

547
00:46:09,818 --> 00:46:11,320
What, "Oh, no"?

548
00:46:15,324 --> 00:46:16,783
The toxin?

549
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:22,247
The toxin is affecting them?

550
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:24,374
Are those people killing themselves?

551
00:46:24,499 --> 00:46:26,209
You were with the Private.
What do we do?

552
00:46:26,293 --> 00:46:29,379
- We need to do something!
- Just let me think.

553
00:46:31,465 --> 00:46:33,216
- They're dying!
- I need a second.

554
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,886
They released it?
We're not near the roads.

555
00:46:36,011 --> 00:46:38,388
We can't just stand here
as uninvolved observers!

556
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:39,890
I need a second, okay.
Just give me a second!

557
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:42,184
We are not going to be
one of those assholes on the news

558
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:44,144
who watches a crime happen
and not do something!

559
00:46:44,227 --> 00:46:46,104
- We're not assholes!
- Just a second!

560
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:47,397
There were children in that group!

561
00:46:47,481 --> 00:46:50,233
- Elliot, please tell us what to do.
- I need a second, okay!

562
00:46:50,317 --> 00:46:53,570
Why can't anybody
give me a goddamn second?

563
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,238
All right, be scientific, douchebag.

564
00:46:55,322 --> 00:46:58,283
Identify the variables.
That's the two groups.

565
00:46:58,367 --> 00:47:01,411
Design an experiment.
That's what we're in.

566
00:47:01,495 --> 00:47:04,498
Careful observation and measurements.
That's what I'm trying to do.

567
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:07,501
Interpret the experimental data.
Interpret.

568
00:47:10,045 --> 00:47:12,130
What if it is the plants?

569
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:15,717
Their group was larger than ours.

570
00:47:15,801 --> 00:47:17,803
This thing has been escalating all day.

571
00:47:17,886 --> 00:47:20,681
Smaller and smaller populations
have been setting this off.

572
00:47:20,764 --> 00:47:23,100
They react to human stimulus.

573
00:47:24,476 --> 00:47:26,353
Maybe people are
setting off the plants?

574
00:47:26,436 --> 00:47:28,939
What are you saying? That guy was crazy.
We have to save them.

575
00:47:29,022 --> 00:47:31,274
They're already dead.

576
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:33,860
What if they're
targeting us as threats?

577
00:47:33,944 --> 00:47:38,115
This part of the field
may not have been set off.

578
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,993
Something in this field could be
releasing the chemical into the air

579
00:47:41,076 --> 00:47:43,996
when there's too
many of us together.

580
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:48,292
Let's just stay
ahead of the wind.

581
00:48:04,683 --> 00:48:07,102
Let's just break up into groups.

582
00:48:16,111 --> 00:48:20,282
Come on! Come on! This way!
Come on, follow me!

583
00:48:23,076 --> 00:48:27,164
I'm right here! Keep going!
I'm right behind you!

584
00:48:35,756 --> 00:48:37,424
Here it comes!

585
00:48:39,176 --> 00:48:41,470
Don't you let go of my hand.

586
00:49:33,689 --> 00:49:35,732
Nothing happened.

587
00:49:35,857 --> 00:49:38,694
It's the size of the groups,
I think.

588
00:49:38,902 --> 00:49:40,862
Could this really be happening?

589
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,118
What are your names?

590
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:48,745
- Jared.
- Josh.

591
00:49:48,912 --> 00:49:50,372
Wait, wait!

592
00:50:05,429 --> 00:50:09,391
I'm going to go see if that truck
has a map. You guys wait here.

593
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:37,669
Why aren't they looking
into nuclear power plants?

594
00:50:37,753 --> 00:50:40,130
There are 15 or more
in the Northeast alone.

595
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,591
More than anywhere else
in the United States.

596
00:50:42,674 --> 00:50:45,260
There's probably been
some leak or something.

597
00:50:45,302 --> 00:50:47,721
It's probably poisoning the air.

598
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,231
There's a house over there! Come on!

599
00:51:01,818 --> 00:51:03,278
It could have been
some terrorist booby-trap,

600
00:51:03,362 --> 00:51:05,155
someone stepped on
it out in the field.

601
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,324
Yeah, in a field
in Bumbletown, Pennsylvania.

602
00:51:07,366 --> 00:51:08,992
I don't know.

603
00:51:10,285 --> 00:51:14,164
Look, a toxin dissipates quickly in the air.
They're only potent in a certain density.

604
00:51:14,289 --> 00:51:17,834
The source had to be close to that field,
if not in the field.

605
00:51:17,918 --> 00:51:19,461
Here's one.

606
00:51:20,128 --> 00:51:25,842
Plants have the chemistry to do this.
They release co-transporters into the air.

607
00:51:26,051 --> 00:51:28,136
You think it could be plants?

608
00:51:28,178 --> 00:51:29,763
I don't know.

609
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,933
But if it is, and people are
setting it off in groups,

610
00:51:33,058 --> 00:51:36,186
we need to go to the least
populated place we can to be safe.

611
00:51:36,269 --> 00:51:39,648
We can't walk to the borders where this
isn't happening, Alma. It's too far.

612
00:51:39,731 --> 00:51:44,027
Whatever it is, terrorists,
a nuclear leak, plants,

613
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:47,531
it's probably safe to get
away from people right now.

614
00:51:47,656 --> 00:51:50,367
That must be Arundell.
It's 10 miles from here.

615
00:51:50,492 --> 00:51:53,704
Okay, this place must have a bathroom.
I'm gonna take Jess, then we can leave.

616
00:51:53,787 --> 00:51:55,163
Hurry.

617
00:52:10,721 --> 00:52:12,055
Hello?

618
00:52:13,015 --> 00:52:15,017
My name is Elliot Moore.

619
00:52:16,685 --> 00:52:19,521
I'm just going to talk
in a very positive manner.

620
00:52:19,604 --> 00:52:22,399
Giving off good vibes.

621
00:52:22,524 --> 00:52:27,321
We're just here to use the bathroom
and then we're just gonna leave.

622
00:52:27,404 --> 00:52:29,323
I hope that's okay.

623
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,333
Plastic.

624
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,669
I'm talking to a plastic plant.

625
00:52:44,254 --> 00:52:46,089
I'm still doing it.

626
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,720
You guys ready to leave?

627
00:52:51,762 --> 00:52:55,766
These people must have left in a hurry.
I mean, leaving the front door unlocked?

628
00:52:55,891 --> 00:52:57,893
Hey, everything's fake.

629
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:20,123
Why is this happening?

630
00:53:20,248 --> 00:53:22,292
I don't know for sure, Josh.

631
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:25,253
But I read this article
about the coast of Australia.

632
00:53:25,337 --> 00:53:28,966
It said they found large quantities
of a primordial bacteria.

633
00:53:29,091 --> 00:53:32,386
It hadn't been around for billions
of years, it just appeared in the water.

634
00:53:32,469 --> 00:53:36,223
It's toxic to humans, fishermen
who come in contact with it are dying.

635
00:53:36,264 --> 00:53:37,599
It feels kind of similar to that.

636
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:41,937
With the bees disappearing, I mean,
I don't know, it feels like a pattern.

637
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:44,398
The nature of events
like the one in Australia

638
00:53:44,523 --> 00:53:47,109
is that they crest and then stop.

639
00:53:47,275 --> 00:53:50,445
We just have to be
alive when it's over.

640
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:53,282
I don't believe it's nature.

641
00:53:53,323 --> 00:53:57,619
It may not be. There could be some
other explanation. I don't know.

642
00:53:59,538 --> 00:54:00,998
Let's go.

643
00:54:01,665 --> 00:54:03,166
There are people coming!

644
00:54:03,292 --> 00:54:07,212
We can't stay here. It's close to the roads.
More and more people will come here.

645
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,647
There's two groups coming together.

646
00:54:26,857 --> 00:54:29,401
There's too many of them together.

647
00:54:30,527 --> 00:54:32,154
Run. Run.

648
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,909
- Is she your kid?
- No.

649
00:55:19,034 --> 00:55:21,161
- You got kids?
- No.

650
00:55:21,244 --> 00:55:22,913
How come? You got a problem?

651
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,916
No. She wanted to wait.

652
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:27,668
Really? For what?

653
00:55:27,751 --> 00:55:30,879
Me to grow up.
Why are we talking about this?

654
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:36,426
Sweet. I used to love those.
Can I see it?

655
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,140
You need to take personal responsibility
for yourself in a relationship.

656
00:55:42,182 --> 00:55:44,768
- That'll make a difference.
- Okay. Thank you.

657
00:55:44,893 --> 00:55:47,980
Hey, that's not a toy.
It's got meaning to me.

658
00:55:49,564 --> 00:55:52,609
- Elliot! Look!
- Come on.

659
00:55:55,821 --> 00:55:56,863
Oh, wow.

660
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:04,913
... is an emergency broadcast.

661
00:56:04,997 --> 00:56:08,583
All those who are still inside
the affected area of the Northeast

662
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:12,713
are asked to proceed to the police
borders west of your state.

663
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,464
Come on.

664
00:56:14,548 --> 00:56:16,925
This is an emergency broadcast.

665
00:56:18,385 --> 00:56:20,762
... inside the affected area...

666
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:30,814
Jess needs a 10-minute rest
and some food.

667
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,616
Are you sure?
We should keep going.

668
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:43,493
I know, but she's only eight.

669
00:56:46,163 --> 00:56:47,789
What?

670
00:56:47,873 --> 00:56:50,500
If we're going to die,
I want you to know something.

671
00:56:50,584 --> 00:56:52,669
I was in the pharmacy a while ago,

672
00:56:52,753 --> 00:56:55,756
and there was a really good-looking
pharmacist behind the counter.

673
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,424
Really good-looking.

674
00:56:57,466 --> 00:57:00,010
And I went up and I asked her
where the cough syrup was.

675
00:57:00,135 --> 00:57:02,304
I didn't even have a cough.

676
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:04,598
And I almost bought it.

677
00:57:04,681 --> 00:57:08,268
And I'm talking about a completely
superfluous bottle of cough syrup.

678
00:57:08,352 --> 00:57:10,646
That's like six bucks.

679
00:57:12,147 --> 00:57:13,857
Are you joking?

680
00:57:20,948 --> 00:57:22,491
Thank you.

681
00:57:53,522 --> 00:57:57,484
- Maybe that's not a good idea.
- I told her just for a minute.

682
00:58:03,282 --> 00:58:05,033
Mr. Moore,
I think I can open this door.

683
00:58:05,075 --> 00:58:07,744
Wait. We're a gang now?
We're gonna take whatever we want?

684
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:09,705
- Come on, guys.
- Listen, nobody's home.

685
00:58:09,788 --> 00:58:11,415
We're just gonna
get some food for Jess.

686
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,959
Yeah, and it looks like nobody's
lived here for a long time anyway.

687
00:58:14,084 --> 00:58:15,919
I mean, it's all boarded up.

688
00:58:16,044 --> 00:58:18,463
Maybe we could leave some money.

689
00:58:21,883 --> 00:58:25,887
- What kind of tree is this?
- I think it's a maple.

690
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:28,765
Not so high.

691
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:31,351
Okay, Josh, open the door.

692
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,478
Wait!

693
00:58:34,396 --> 00:58:36,732
I see something.

694
00:58:36,815 --> 00:58:38,650
- There's somebody in there!
- You sure?

695
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:40,611
Yeah, I saw him move.

696
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,572
I see him!

697
00:58:45,282 --> 00:58:46,700
Let's stop.

698
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:53,498
Is there any way we could get some food?
We have a little girl.

699
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:56,084
- We just want to get her some food.
- You best leave now.

700
00:58:56,126 --> 00:58:58,128
You ain't gonna bring that
poison gas in here with you.

701
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,964
Sir, it's not poison gas.
There's none out here.

702
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:04,259
- They said to stay inside.
- We're fine right now.

703
00:59:04,384 --> 00:59:06,386
Nothing's happened out here yet.

704
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:09,681
I mean, you can see that.
Just listen to our voices.

705
00:59:09,765 --> 00:59:11,767
We're perfectly normal.

706
00:59:13,018 --> 00:59:15,270
Old black water,
keep on rolling

707
00:59:15,312 --> 00:59:18,857
Mississippi moon
Won't you keep on shining on me?

708
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:20,984
See? We're normal.

709
00:59:23,904 --> 00:59:27,199
You ain't from around here.
You'd best leave now.

710
00:59:27,324 --> 00:59:29,368
Okay. It's not worth it.

711
00:59:30,285 --> 00:59:31,620
Open the door, bitch!

712
00:59:31,703 --> 00:59:35,332
Hey, Josh, don't do that.
He didn't mean that!

713
00:59:35,374 --> 00:59:39,461
- There's more than one in there.
- Jess! Jess, come here.

714
00:59:39,503 --> 00:59:43,340
Stop it, Jess. Listen, we just want some
food for a little girl, you pussies!

715
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,801
- Jess, come here.
- Josh, stop it.

716
00:59:47,427 --> 00:59:48,971
You'd best not let that gas in here.

717
00:59:49,096 --> 00:59:52,265
Sir, the air is fine out here right now.
You don't need to worry.

718
00:59:52,349 --> 00:59:57,062
- You might be with the terrorists!
- I don't think it's terrorists, sir.

719
00:59:57,145 --> 01:00:00,107
- Josh, stop it!
- They're being crazy, Mr. Moore!

720
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:02,317
- Show your faces!
- Let the gas in...

721
01:00:02,401 --> 01:00:03,860
No!

722
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:20,210
Jared!

723
01:00:35,892 --> 01:00:38,729
We're gonna get
out of this nightmare.

724
01:00:46,737 --> 01:00:48,196
Elliot!

725
01:00:53,452 --> 01:00:57,205
We have to go.
We have to protect Jess.

726
01:00:57,873 --> 01:00:59,041
Okay?

727
01:01:03,712 --> 01:01:06,632
You've got to three
to get off our porch!

728
01:01:13,305 --> 01:01:14,806
Come here.

729
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,938
No new people have crossed
over the border for a few hours.

730
01:01:22,022 --> 01:01:25,901
It appears those residents that are still
in the affected area of the Northeast

731
01:01:25,943 --> 01:01:27,277
are trying to wait it out.

732
01:01:27,361 --> 01:01:29,696
We have Professor Kendel Wallace
of Carnegie Mellon,

733
01:01:29,738 --> 01:01:32,866
a statistician, here with us.
Professor, what can you tell us?

734
01:01:33,075 --> 01:01:36,536
Calculating by the rise in
intensity of reports of incidents

735
01:01:36,578 --> 01:01:41,333
within the affected area,
one can guess at a crude timetable.

736
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:44,836
One can see the incident
is rising in sensitivity.

737
01:01:45,128 --> 01:01:48,715
We've seen fewer and fewer people
can provoke the attacks.

738
01:01:49,299 --> 01:01:53,387
The event should be at its most
sensitive tomorrow morning.

739
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:57,307
Typically, these type of slopes
drop precipitously after cresting,

740
01:01:57,391 --> 01:02:01,645
meaning it could end suddenly,
at any moment.

741
01:02:01,728 --> 01:02:04,481
Of course,
these are only probabilities.

742
01:02:04,606 --> 01:02:05,857
There are some quiet rumblings

743
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:08,610
that the government may be
involved in the tragic events

744
01:02:08,694 --> 01:02:12,072
playing out in the Northeast.
Now, these rumors have been fuelled

745
01:02:12,114 --> 01:02:14,950
by the statements
of a confidential informant

746
01:02:15,033 --> 01:02:18,954
who claims that the CIA
has facilities in the Northeast,

747
01:02:19,037 --> 01:02:23,125
where they are testing drugs with
some similar psychotropic properties

748
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:25,919
as a defense against
chemical weapons.

749
01:02:26,003 --> 01:02:27,796
CIA and White House officials

750
01:02:27,879 --> 01:02:30,882
have declined to respond
to these accusations.

751
01:02:30,966 --> 01:02:34,261
Perimeters have been set up
all along the East Coast

752
01:02:34,303 --> 01:02:37,306
from Maryland
all the way to Massachusetts.

753
01:02:48,817 --> 01:02:51,945
This house has no power going to it.

754
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:55,198
Nobody's driven on this driveway
for a long time, either.

755
01:02:55,324 --> 01:02:57,868
Let me go. You guys stay right here.

756
01:03:28,357 --> 01:03:30,192
That's for Clement.

757
01:03:34,404 --> 01:03:36,114
He's a retriever.

758
01:03:39,326 --> 01:03:40,827
You lost?

759
01:03:42,537 --> 01:03:44,498
You must be.

760
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:47,501
There ain't nothing
around here for miles.

761
01:03:50,212 --> 01:03:52,673
Why are you eyeing my lemon drink?

762
01:03:57,094 --> 01:04:01,306
I suppose the kind thing for me
to do is to offer you supper.

763
01:04:10,691 --> 01:04:12,901
I ain't gonna ask you again.

764
01:04:30,544 --> 01:04:32,921
I hope the meal was sufficient.

765
01:04:34,715 --> 01:04:36,967
I wasn't expecting guests.

766
01:04:41,888 --> 01:04:44,224
This is a beautiful place.

767
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,146
There's a springhouse in the back.

768
01:04:50,939 --> 01:04:54,526
They used to hide people
from slave chasers back there.

769
01:04:56,612 --> 01:05:01,325
It has a speaking tube running
under the ground to the main house.

770
01:05:03,327 --> 01:05:06,955
You can hear each other
like you were in the same room.

771
01:05:11,918 --> 01:05:14,004
So, what's with you two?

772
01:05:16,006 --> 01:05:17,758
Who's chasing who?

773
01:05:18,508 --> 01:05:19,968
I'm sorry?

774
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:26,099
Ain't no time two people staring
at each other, standing still,

775
01:05:26,224 --> 01:05:29,561
love in both their eyes,
at the same time, equal.

776
01:05:31,355 --> 01:05:34,691
Truth is, someone is chasing someone.

777
01:05:36,151 --> 01:05:38,320
That's the way we's built.

778
01:05:40,072 --> 01:05:41,323
So?

779
01:05:42,324 --> 01:05:43,951
Who's chasing?

780
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:49,331
I knew that. I knew that.

781
01:05:57,881 --> 01:06:00,550
Don't touch things that aren't yours.

782
01:06:07,182 --> 01:06:09,685
- Do you have a radio, Mrs. Jones?
- No.

783
01:06:09,726 --> 01:06:12,688
I got enough to fill my time right here.

784
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:16,733
I mend my own things.
I grow my own food.

785
01:06:18,902 --> 01:06:21,321
Although I ain't got the touch.

786
01:06:22,906 --> 01:06:26,326
Gardens don't grow the way they should.
Never have.

787
01:06:27,703 --> 01:06:32,416
- How do you stay in contact with others?
- I don't.

788
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,378
How would you know if something
were to happen? Like a world event?

789
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:40,465
Mrs. Jones, something's happened
along the East Coast.

790
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:42,509
Whatever it is that
you think is so important

791
01:06:42,592 --> 01:06:45,053
that you need to tell me, don't.

792
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,266
Just keep it to yourself.

793
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:53,895
The world don't care about me.
I don't care about it.

794
01:06:58,775 --> 01:07:01,820
Suppose I have to
let you spend the night.

795
01:07:03,113 --> 01:07:05,782
Guest room's up on the left.

796
01:07:05,907 --> 01:07:07,492
Mind the steps.

797
01:07:31,016 --> 01:07:33,477
I'm scared, Elliot.

798
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,062
It's okay.

799
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:42,110
I'm sorry about everything.
That Joey thing. I was being stupid.

800
01:07:42,152 --> 01:07:44,947
You've been great taking care of Jess.

801
01:07:47,824 --> 01:07:49,993
I don't like this woman.

802
01:07:50,118 --> 01:07:54,915
There's something Exorcist-y about her.
How could she hit Jess like that?

803
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:58,627
Well, we need to stay in this house.

804
01:07:58,669 --> 01:08:01,421
You want me to protect you,
this is how we have to do it.

805
01:08:01,463 --> 01:08:03,632
Let's just deal with her.

806
01:08:21,358 --> 01:08:23,318
I hear you whispering.

807
01:08:24,236 --> 01:08:26,863
Planning on stealing something?

808
01:08:26,947 --> 01:08:28,740
No, ma'am, we're not.

809
01:08:28,824 --> 01:08:31,535
Plan on murdering me in my sleep?

810
01:08:31,576 --> 01:08:33,328
What? No!

811
01:10:07,839 --> 01:10:09,299
Mrs. Jones?

812
01:10:18,558 --> 01:10:20,060
Mrs. Jones?

813
01:10:37,536 --> 01:10:38,745
Crazy lady.

814
01:10:38,954 --> 01:10:40,831
You trying to steal my things?

815
01:10:40,914 --> 01:10:44,084
No! No, Mrs. Jones,
I actually wanted to talk with you.

816
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:48,672
- You all are gonna leave right now!
- Ma'am, you don't understand.

817
01:10:48,755 --> 01:10:51,508
There's something happening
in a few states, in this region.

818
01:10:51,591 --> 01:10:54,052
- It's not safe!
- Leave now!

819
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,697
The Lord is my shepherd.

820
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:18,827
The Lord is my shepherd.

821
01:11:19,828 --> 01:11:22,664
Mrs. Jones,
could we talk calmly for a second?

822
01:11:22,706 --> 01:11:26,084
Just hear me out.
See, I'm a teacher...

823
01:11:42,351 --> 01:11:44,061
Mrs. Jones?

824
01:11:48,231 --> 01:11:49,691
Oh, my God.

825
01:11:56,573 --> 01:11:59,284
Alma, shut the windows
and the doors!

826
01:12:03,789 --> 01:12:05,290
Alma?

827
01:12:11,088 --> 01:12:12,547
Alma?

828
01:13:34,504 --> 01:13:35,964
Alma?

829
01:13:37,674 --> 01:13:38,967
Jess?

830
01:13:42,596 --> 01:13:46,099
Hi, froggie! Hi, froggie!

831
01:14:07,037 --> 01:14:08,664
Okay, yeah. Wait.

832
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:14,670
How old do you think he is?
Is he a baby? I think he's a baby.

833
01:14:15,963 --> 01:14:19,508
He's so tiny.
I didn't know frogs could be like that.

834
01:14:19,591 --> 01:14:21,927
Oh, he got water on my shoe.

835
01:14:24,721 --> 01:14:26,056
Isn't this a cool house?

836
01:14:26,098 --> 01:14:29,851
If we had this house,
we could make it look so pretty.

837
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:36,608
Get him again. Get him again.
Hey, froggie.

838
01:14:36,692 --> 01:14:38,151
Alma?

839
01:14:39,069 --> 01:14:42,531
Good morning, Elliot.
Sounds like you're right here.

840
01:14:42,572 --> 01:14:45,701
- Close the windows and the doors, Alma.
- Why?

841
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:49,871
Mrs. Jones just died.
Close the windows.

842
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:54,710
Close the door, Jess!

843
01:15:17,899 --> 01:15:20,027
- Is everything closed?
- Yes.

844
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:37,002
- I'm sorry, Alma.
- What's going on, Elliot?

845
01:15:37,961 --> 01:15:39,713
It's happening here.

846
01:15:39,796 --> 01:15:42,841
It could be the grass and
the trees are doing this now.

847
01:15:42,924 --> 01:15:45,844
She was alone when it happened.

848
01:15:45,927 --> 01:15:49,222
Seems like they might have
gotten more sensitive.

849
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:53,602
It's too dangerous
to go outside, isn't it?

850
01:15:53,685 --> 01:15:55,103
Yes.

851
01:15:58,023 --> 01:16:00,108
This is the end, isn't it?

852
01:16:02,444 --> 01:16:04,279
I wish you were here.

853
01:16:05,322 --> 01:16:06,740
Me, too.

854
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:23,507
You remember our first date?

855
01:16:24,883 --> 01:16:26,301
You were so quiet.

856
01:16:26,426 --> 01:16:28,762
You bought me the mood ring.

857
01:16:31,682 --> 01:16:34,184
It turned purple when you wore it.

858
01:16:35,519 --> 01:16:38,855
Then you said,
"That means you're in love."

859
01:16:41,316 --> 01:16:43,735
It got you to talk, didn't it?

860
01:16:52,911 --> 01:16:54,955
Then we checked
the little paper chart,

861
01:16:55,038 --> 01:16:58,292
and it turned out that
purple meant I was horny.

862
01:16:59,334 --> 01:17:01,878
- You loved that.
- I had no idea.

863
01:17:04,339 --> 01:17:07,801
Yours was blue.
Peaceful, right?

864
01:17:08,927 --> 01:17:10,345
Right.

865
01:17:12,097 --> 01:17:13,932
What color was love?

866
01:17:18,812 --> 01:17:21,023
I don't remember.

867
01:17:21,064 --> 01:17:22,566
Me, neither.

868
01:17:31,074 --> 01:17:32,909
Elliot?

869
01:17:32,951 --> 01:17:34,077
Yeah?

870
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,955
I was just making
sure you're there.

871
01:17:44,796 --> 01:17:47,674
It's not right for it to end like this.

872
01:17:47,758 --> 01:17:50,177
If we're gonna die,
I want to be with you.

873
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:54,139
I want to be with you,
and I'm gonna come and be with you.

874
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,853
Elliot, don't!

875
01:20:27,542 --> 01:20:30,963
The event must have ended
before we went out there.

876
01:20:40,305 --> 01:20:42,265
I found the hair clip!

877
01:20:46,478 --> 01:20:50,440
You don't want to be late
for the first day schools are open.

878
01:20:51,275 --> 01:20:52,776
Oh, wait.

879
01:20:55,404 --> 01:20:57,990
I'm just gonna put this right here.

880
01:20:59,449 --> 01:21:00,867
Okay?

881
01:21:05,539 --> 01:21:09,459
- Are you okay?
- Yes, Aunt Alma. I love you.

882
01:21:10,794 --> 01:21:13,046
I love you, too. Come here.

883
01:21:24,016 --> 01:21:28,061
All right. I'll pick you up
after you're done with school, okay?

884
01:21:39,323 --> 01:21:40,782
Bye.

885
01:21:46,913 --> 01:21:48,290
As everyone knows by now,

886
01:21:48,373 --> 01:21:51,710
traces of the neurotoxin have been
found in some plants and trees.

887
01:21:51,835 --> 01:21:53,211
Now, most environmentalists feel

888
01:21:53,337 --> 01:21:57,215
that this event is like
the red tide in the ocean,

889
01:21:57,341 --> 01:22:01,720
but instead of algae killing fish,
this happened on land.

890
01:22:01,803 --> 01:22:03,347
Now, plants and trees
just can't pick up and move

891
01:22:03,472 --> 01:22:05,140
when they feel threatened,
like other species.

892
01:22:05,265 --> 01:22:09,394
They have only one option,
to rapidly evolve their chemistry.

893
01:22:09,519 --> 01:22:10,979
Well.

894
01:22:11,063 --> 01:22:15,984
Kay from Mississippi wants to know
why it started so suddenly,

895
01:22:16,068 --> 01:22:21,323
on a Tuesday at 8:33 and then ended
so suddenly at 9:27 the next morning.

896
01:22:21,406 --> 01:22:26,620
Well, Kay, to be perfectly honest,
this was an act of nature,

897
01:22:26,662 --> 01:22:29,164
and we'll never fully understand it.

898
01:22:29,247 --> 01:22:32,876
And, Doctor, there's been
a lot of speculation

899
01:22:32,918 --> 01:22:36,088
as to why this happened
in the Northeast only.

900
01:22:36,713 --> 01:22:37,881
How do you explain that?

901
01:22:37,965 --> 01:22:40,509
Well, I believe, all right,
and this is just my opinion,

902
01:22:40,592 --> 01:22:42,302
that this was a prelude, okay?

903
01:22:42,427 --> 01:22:45,722
A warning,
like the first spot of a rash.

904
01:22:45,806 --> 01:22:47,975
We have become
a threat to this planet.

905
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,060
I don't think anybody
will argue that.

906
01:22:50,102 --> 01:22:52,062
- And this is a warning.
- A warning?

907
01:22:52,187 --> 01:22:55,899
I think the skeptics would believe that
if it had occurred anywhere else.

908
01:22:55,941 --> 01:22:58,568
That's why most people
believe it was the government.

909
01:22:58,652 --> 01:23:02,698
If it had happened in one other place,
anywhere else,

910
01:23:02,739 --> 01:23:04,074
we could all believe
what you're saying.

911
01:24:41,338 --> 01:24:44,508
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.

912
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,843
Can you make Nadia's party tonight?

913
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:52,015
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.

914
01:24:58,689 --> 01:25:00,732
That frightened me.

915
01:25:04,695 --> 01:25:06,530
I should drop my bicycle off

916
01:25:06,697 --> 01:25:07,739
What?

917
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:19,835
My God...

918
01:25:20,669 --> 01:25:22,796
My
bicycle.

919
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,116
