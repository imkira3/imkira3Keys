00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,893
<i>In ages past,</i>

3
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:58,094
<i>the dragons and their crystals of power</i>

4
00:00:58,169 --> 00:01:00,262
<i>came to this barbaric land</i>

5
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:02,363
<i>through the portal from Dragon World.</i>

6
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,673
<i>The crystals brought strength and wisdom,</i>

7
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:09,905
<i>especially the great Aurathon,</i>

8
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,173
<i>the mighty crystal</i>

9
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,613
<i>with powers so vast it could only be wielded</i>

10
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:16,150
<i>by the Dragon King himself.</i>

11
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:21,313
<i>But though the dragons wanted only peace,</i>

12
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:24,722
<i>their human allies wanted war.</i>

13
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,090
<i>The kingdoms of Norvagen and Draigar</i>

14
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:29,721
<i>misused the knowledge</i>
<i>brought by the dragons,</i>

15
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:31,992
<i>and battles erupted.</i>

16
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:36,395
<i>Seeking to end the wars,</i>

17
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:39,131
<i>the Dragon King</i>
<i>made the wizard, Xenoz,</i>

18
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:42,264
<i>ambassador between the dragons</i>
<i>and the two kingdoms.</i>

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,003
<i>He was given dragon-gifts</i>
<i>and immortality.</i>

20
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:49,308
<i>And for a time, Xenoz</i>
<i>and the Dragon King</i>

21
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:51,871
<i>forced peace upon the land.</i>

22
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:55,043
<i>But peace imposed by</i>
<i>others cannot last.</i>

23
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:03,015
<i>Then came the great betrayal.</i>

24
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:05,686
<i>Evil forces arose,</i>

25
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:07,695
<i>and the Dragon Queen was slain.</i>

26
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:12,028
<i>In his anguish,</i>

27
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,862
<i>the Dragon King and many of his followers</i>

28
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:15,960
<i>returned to Dragon World,</i>

29
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:18,062
<i>closing the portal.</i>

30
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,039
<i>The great Aurathon,</i>

31
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,734
<i>the receptacle of all dragon knowledge</i>

32
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,367
<i>and the only crystal whose powers</i>

33
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,435
<i>could open the portal itself,</i>

34
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,707
<i>went with them.</i>

35
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:32,150
That's what it looked like.

36
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:35,278
'Course, no one's seen it for a thousand years.

37
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:39,050
But... but we still have dragons, Dad.

38
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:43,184
Eh? Oh, yes, Targon is
an old friend of the family,

39
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,455
so he stayed behind.

40
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:46,826
You ready?

41
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:53,499
You always tell me never to let myself

42
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:56,094
get distracted by an opponent!

43
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:58,936
Right you are, lad.

44
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:00,134
Help me up.

45
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:05,612
What else do I always say?

46
00:03:07,616 --> 00:03:09,674
Never trust a soul...

47
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,548
- except a dragon's.

48
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,679
So how many dragons are left?

49
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:18,952
Targon there is all
we Norvagen have these days.

50
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,550
Although the legend says
they may return

51
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:23,960
when the war is over,

52
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,553
I doubt it.

53
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:29,032
Not if the Draigar keep hunting them.

54
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,295
Those rotten Draigar!

55
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:39,266
I like the attitude, son,

56
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:41,776
but you swung
before you were ready.

57
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:45,281
Think, lad. Plan.

58
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:47,612
You're too impulsive.

59
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:51,881
But other than that,
an excellent practice.

60
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:54,218
I do believe you're ready.

61
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,621
For what?

62
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,092
Ah, Xenoz!

63
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:06,355
Thank you for coming.

64
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:10,562
I have a surprise for you, my boy.

65
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:26,516
We are in harmony.

66
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:29,381
Let your senses seek
the wisdom of the ancients.

67
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,216
I feel you, Father.

68
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:32,812
When you are ready...

69
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,619
you may... strike!

70
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:50,329
Your skills have grown impressive.

71
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:53,738
I have a good teacher.

72
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:54,797
Aurora!

73
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,278
Hey, no fair!

74
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:03,213
That's cheating!

75
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:06,008
That is battle, Kyra.

76
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:08,781
Norvagen do not fight by the rules.

77
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:11,687
You assumed we were
finished and we were not.

78
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:15,090
You think too much.

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,026
Sometimes a soldier
must simply act.

80
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:24,665
Don't think I'm going
to forgive you, Aurora.

81
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:27,568
Even if you are
the last dragon we have.

82
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:30,263
Oh, I think you shall.

83
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,170
After all, someone must stand against

84
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:34,675
those dragon-hunting Norvagen.

85
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:36,769
Is that not right, Xenoz?

86
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:38,404
Oh, absolutely.

87
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:41,844
I have come as you requested, King Siddari.

88
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,077
Although sometimes I wonder.

89
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,245
As the dragons vanish, the need for

90
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:49,050
a dragon ambassador
grows questionable.

91
00:05:49,123 --> 00:05:50,147
I could retire...

92
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:55,185
Looks like Aurora doesn't
like that idea, Xenoz!

93
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:57,195
How complimentary.

94
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:01,461
I understand you have
a special surprise

95
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:02,626
for your daughter?

96
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:05,431
Indeed I do.

97
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:06,732
Father!

98
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:09,603
You mean my first dragon flight?

99
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:11,800
Well, perhaps not?

100
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:16,245
As I recall, you are upset with Aurora
at the moment...

101
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:17,712
With Aurora?

102
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:18,907
No way!

103
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,085
We're best friends!
Tell him, Aurora!

104
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:26,254
Well, what do you think, Xenoz...

105
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:27,754
Great dragons, sir!

106
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:29,085
Are you sweating again?

107
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:33,853
As always, Your Highness, I find it

108
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:36,954
too warm here after
the chill of my ice palace.

109
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:40,000
But as for your daughter,
I think she is ready.

110
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:42,263
Then will you
give her your blessing?

111
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:47,265
By the powers bestowed
upon me by the dragons,

112
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,672
may these two fly together as one.

113
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,232
Can I go? Can I?

114
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,245
She's all yours, but be careful.

115
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,973
Then come on, Aurora!

116
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,572
Let's fly!

117
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:07,718
Have you ever seen Aurora accept
a rider so completely, Xenoz?

118
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,019
Xenoz?

119
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:23,766
Aye, the boy was
born for that dragon!

120
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:42,677
What?

121
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:54,954
What?

122
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:55,964
Aurora!

123
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,432
Where are you going?

124
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:58,730
Stop!

125
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:00,737
Something's wrong! Soldiers!

126
00:08:00,805 --> 00:08:02,635
To me!

127
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:06,365
No! Turn!

128
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:07,910
I said turn!

129
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:38,935
If this is the doing
of that Draigar, Siddari...

130
00:10:43,213 --> 00:10:44,202
You!

131
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,173
Stay back!

132
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,307
Norvagen!

133
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:53,054
Over here! This way!

134
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:02,654
Norvagen!

135
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,253
Draigar!

136
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,231
I knew they were behind this!

137
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,097
Attack!

138
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,567
Warriors!

139
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,952
So... it begins again.

140
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,455
You are troubled, son.

141
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,690
Yeah, you could tell?

142
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:22,629
The wind speaks your mood.

143
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:24,257
It always has.

144
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:27,201
I sometimes wonder
if it is affecting you

145
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,635
or whether you affect it.

146
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:30,035
That's absurd!

147
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:31,198
Sure it is.

148
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:34,606
And yet the wind is angry,
and so are you.

149
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:36,406
Why shouldn't I be!

150
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,609
I mean, this latest
skirmish with the Draigar

151
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:42,377
has lasted eight years!

152
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,474
That's half my life!

153
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:45,178
What's eight years

154
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:47,584
when the war itself
has lasted a thousand?

155
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:49,087
When you reach my age...

156
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:50,487
When I reach your age,

157
00:12:50,557 --> 00:12:52,115
I want peace!

158
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:53,386
And the sky...

159
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,189
I want to see the sky
filled with dragons again!

160
00:12:56,262 --> 00:12:58,127
You know the legend says they'll return

161
00:12:58,197 --> 00:12:59,596
when the war is over!

162
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,027
Wishful thinking.

163
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:06,559
This war has sapped our land,
our people, our energy.

164
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:07,605
But tomorrow's battle...

165
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:10,196
Will be the same! Again!

166
00:13:10,274 --> 00:13:12,538
Let me end this... tonight!

167
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,542
What!

168
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:15,010
Let me take Targon.

169
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:16,603
I'll come in fast and hard,

170
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,510
right into the Draigar castle itself.

171
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,946
I can capture the princess

172
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:22,541
and be gone before those
Draigar can even respond!

173
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,416
And with her as our captive,

174
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:28,047
they'll be forced to surrender on our terms!

175
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:30,352
What?

176
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:33,223
The princess is a respected fighter, son.

177
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:36,752
- She's a girl! I can do this!
- No!

178
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:41,426
Wars are won by armies,
not individuals.

179
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:45,198
Besides, we need you
for tomorrow's battle.

180
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:49,201
No.

181
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,569
This has to end.

182
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:54,613
Tonight.

183
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:11,088
I'm serious, Father!

184
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:13,151
Too many Draigar
soldiers have fallen

185
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:14,253
in this battle.

186
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,298
It's time to end it!

187
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:19,528
By sacrificing you?
No. Out of the question.

188
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:21,296
It's not a sacrifice!

189
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,266
How do you do that?

190
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:28,298
Sorry, you know I can't control it.

191
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:30,400
But this I can!

192
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:31,604
Issue a challenge!

193
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,738
The Norvagen prince against me!

194
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:34,781
One-on-one!

195
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:37,544
To end the war once and for all!

196
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:40,211
The risk is too high.

197
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:42,948
I can take him, Father!

198
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:46,047
He's a clumsy brawler. A Norvagen.

199
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:49,150
I'm the best fighter you have,
you've said so yourself.

200
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:51,696
And you can prove that
tomorrow, in battle,

201
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:53,855
with soldiers beside you.

202
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:55,796
As it should be.

203
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:00,962
What are you saying?

204
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:03,767
That you want another
thousand years of war?

205
00:15:10,646 --> 00:15:12,045
I tried, Aurora.

206
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:14,207
I didn't even mention the legend.

207
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:17,581
But I know you want your kind
to return as much as I do.

208
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,687
This has to happen.

209
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:24,383
The Norvagen and I have
to face each other,

210
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,323
I can feel it.

211
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:29,260
So if my father won't
issue the challenge...

212
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,262
Then I'll challenge the prince myself!

213
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,299
Let's go, Aurora!

214
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,198
Fly!

215
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:48,808
Remember, Targon!

216
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,471
Fast and hard!

217
00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:19,134
Something is happening.

218
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:22,402
Something... momentous.

219
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:24,466
My crystal of scrying!

220
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,624
Well, this is interesting.

221
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:50,092
The two royals.

222
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:09,943
You! Draigar!

223
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:19,424
What are you doing here?

224
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:22,927
I was coming to offer
you a challenge! One on one!

225
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:26,556
I had plans of my own,
but this'll do.

226
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,268
Go, Targon!

227
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:36,966
Aurora! Attack!

228
00:17:58,893 --> 00:18:01,361
Apparently we're in this alone.

229
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:02,793
See you on the ground?

230
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:04,626
After you.

231
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:29,509
Winner takes all?

232
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:33,919
Can't speak for my father,
but that's fine by me!

233
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:21,861
Good move. But you should have
finished me while I was down.

234
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:24,025
Wouldn't have been fair.

235
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:26,959
Whatever.

236
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,385
Fair's fair. As you said.

237
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,939
Let me know when
you're ready to start again.

238
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:23,375
Where is Prince Dev?

239
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:28,082
Sire, the lookout reported him flying
out on Targon before dawn.

240
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:32,820
Well, then. He shall miss
our triumph, hey men?

241
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:48,470
Let the wisdom of the ancients
guide our weapons!

242
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,510
And may the Norvagen
fall beneath them!

243
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:01,615
Forward, men!

244
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:04,745
For the riches of victory!

245
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:06,635
Something familiar... about this place.

246
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,939
There... there should be.

247
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,613
It's where... you and I first met...

248
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:15,740
eight years ago.

249
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:20,948
I remember... the ball
of flame... from the sky.

250
00:22:21,022 --> 00:22:22,353
Yeah.

251
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:23,650
I always...

252
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:26,352
sort of wondered where that went.

253
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:28,826
I see... it scarred your face as well.

254
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:34,464
Have you noticed... anything else?

255
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:36,057
Like what?

256
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:37,397
Unusual things.

257
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,438
Things nobody can seem to explain.

258
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:49,209
You mean...

259
00:22:50,848 --> 00:22:51,906
like that?

260
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:00,746
Or like that.

261
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,404
How do you like that, men?

262
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:25,171
My son was so eager for battle

263
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:26,802
he started without us!

264
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:36,046
Princess Kyra has joined
us for our victory!

265
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,588
Let us not disappoint her!

266
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,185
Attack all sides!

267
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,421
Target kings!

268
00:24:40,377 --> 00:24:41,605
What is this?

269
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:44,545
The Draigar hire mercenaries
to do their fighting now?

270
00:24:44,614 --> 00:24:47,377
They're not ours,
I assure you! Look!

271
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:41,442
Father!

272
00:27:23,118 --> 00:27:24,881
Kyra!

273
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:28,150
Father!

274
00:27:29,825 --> 00:27:32,691
Well, I'm sold.
These guys are not your buddies!

275
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,200
Quickly! Come with me
if you want to save your fathers!

276
00:28:02,553 --> 00:28:03,747
Targon!

277
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,082
Aurora!

278
00:28:09,493 --> 00:28:11,426
We have to go back! Now!

279
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:12,927
My dragon, my father,

280
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:15,156
Have no chance
if you don't come with me.

281
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:17,592
What were those creatures?

282
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:18,860
Vorgons.

283
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:21,027
The servants of a rogue dragon.

284
00:28:21,102 --> 00:28:23,570
They ride Nogards, swamp dragons.

285
00:28:23,638 --> 00:28:24,866
Well, they've got my father!

286
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,372
You have to go after them!

287
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,806
You have a more important
task ahead of you.

288
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,811
What's more important
than rescuing my father?

289
00:28:32,913 --> 00:28:33,902
Hang on!

290
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:54,756
This is my home,
here on Dragon Mountain.

291
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:56,595
You made this?

292
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:59,191
Yeah, he's a wizard. Duh!

293
00:29:04,774 --> 00:29:07,037
Ice is one of my
greatest powers.

294
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:09,100
A gift from the Queen Dragon.

295
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:11,669
All dragons have powers,
contained in those crystals

296
00:29:11,747 --> 00:29:14,340
they wear around their necks.

297
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,319
The site where I just found you

298
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:22,651
was once the congress
for dragons and humans.

299
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:27,826
It was there they decided
how best to use these powers.

300
00:29:27,894 --> 00:29:30,657
Each crystal has its own power.

301
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,721
This dragon's crystal, for instance,

302
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:35,460
allows me to see
into another's mind.

303
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:37,797
Looking into his
mind won't take long.

304
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,071
If it's a dragon's crystal,
how come you have it?

305
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,631
Many dragons entrusted me
with their crystals when they...

306
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:47,836
left this world.

307
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,369
As dragon ambassador,
I can use them as well.

308
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,544
Interesting.

309
00:29:58,621 --> 00:30:01,987
I see that you are concerned
about your father and Targon.

310
00:30:02,057 --> 00:30:03,285
Yeah, obviously. So can we...

311
00:30:03,358 --> 00:30:05,121
That you intended
to kidnap princess Kyra

312
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:06,785
to force an end to the war.

313
00:30:06,862 --> 00:30:09,557
Why, you cowardly creep!

314
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,896
Because you secretly long
for the war to be over,

315
00:30:13,968 --> 00:30:15,629
so that the dragons will return.

316
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:18,433
Oh...

317
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:19,904
We're wasting time.

318
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:23,340
What I need is a crystal that will
help me rescue my father.

319
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,775
There is one.

320
00:30:25,844 --> 00:30:27,243
The Aurathon.

321
00:30:27,313 --> 00:30:28,837
The Aurathon?

322
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:29,881
Of legend?

323
00:30:29,948 --> 00:30:32,382
It's powers are immense.

324
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:35,180
But right now the rogue has it.

325
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:36,447
This rogue.

326
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:39,547
You say he was the giant
fireball that knocked us

327
00:30:39,624 --> 00:30:41,614
from the sky when we were kids?

328
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:46,686
By the time I arrived
on the scene he had vanished.

329
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,925
I've been looking
for him ever since.

330
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:52,399
And you think he was behind the attack?

331
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:53,696
Not think.

332
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,031
Know.

333
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:57,071
I recognize his tactics.

334
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:59,698
But where did he come from? And why?

335
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,834
He must have stolen the Aurathon
and used it to open the portal

336
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:04,605
from Dragon World.

337
00:31:04,678 --> 00:31:07,203
But he was badly
injured in the process.

338
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:09,112
He's been in hiding ever since,

339
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:11,413
trying to heal before I find him.

340
00:31:12,118 --> 00:31:14,279
Sounds like you two have issues.

341
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:17,149
We do.

342
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:34,367
Targon is injured!

343
00:31:34,438 --> 00:31:36,428
Those ugly brutes
captured both the kings!

344
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:49,976
That a girl, Aurora.

345
00:31:50,052 --> 00:31:52,986
The warm oil will speed the healing.

346
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,084
I still don't see why
you can't come with us.

347
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,025
The rogue knows that
my strength is ice.

348
00:32:01,094 --> 00:32:03,927
He has taken refuge
in a cavern of fire.

349
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:06,465
With this and the Aurathon,

350
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:08,090
I cannot stand against him.

351
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,794
And we can?

352
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:12,201
You two are the best
warriors in your kingdoms.

353
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:15,871
Apparently that's not
what my father thinks.

354
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,168
Mine either.

355
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:18,800
Then do this!

356
00:32:18,877 --> 00:32:19,901
Prove yourselves!

357
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:21,343
I don't know.

358
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:23,437
I've fought against plenty of Draigar.

359
00:32:23,514 --> 00:32:25,948
But I've never fought
alongside one before.

360
00:32:26,016 --> 00:32:27,142
I'd rather do this alone.

361
00:32:28,218 --> 00:32:29,947
Afraid I'll show you up?

362
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,247
Now listen, stork...

363
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,845
Save it for the dragon, please.

364
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:41,789
And take these.

365
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:44,298
What are they?

366
00:32:44,366 --> 00:32:46,095
Have you ever seen what happens

367
00:32:46,168 --> 00:32:48,863
to a container full
of water in the snow?

368
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,664
Yeah.

369
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:54,500
It freezes... and explodes.

370
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:56,474
Exactly.

371
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:59,706
I have extracted that
explosive quality of ice

372
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,644
and filled these harpoons with it.

373
00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:03,609
Really?

374
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,013
Cool!

375
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,311
Guys.

376
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,512
My scrying crystal
indicates that crevice

377
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,816
is your way in.

378
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,413
You'll have to get
past the Vorgan guards.

379
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,822
No problem.

380
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,757
Huh, lets go!

381
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,920
Remember!

382
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,485
Don't try to defeat the dragon!

383
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:23,431
Just get the Aurathon and get out!

384
00:36:05,674 --> 00:36:08,006
Something about this feels bad.

385
00:36:10,145 --> 00:36:11,635
These are starting to drip.

386
00:36:11,714 --> 00:36:14,739
And I suspect we don't want
to be around when they melt.

387
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,248
Here, you get his attention.

388
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:18,945
I'll grab the Aurathon.

389
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,317
Hey, who said you're
giving the orders?

390
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,079
All right!

391
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:26,287
Where is he, anyway?

392
00:36:37,636 --> 00:36:39,661
Consider his attention gotten!

393
00:36:57,687 --> 00:36:59,154
Think fast!

394
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:04,683
One more!

395
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,523
I'm almost there!

396
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:53,166
The Aurathon!

397
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:54,862
It's not here!

398
00:37:58,006 --> 00:37:58,938
No.

399
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:01,339
But you are!

400
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,549
Where are we?

401
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,180
I am not certain, but judging from

402
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:19,052
the temperature, I can guess.

403
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:25,390
Ah, yes?

404
00:38:25,464 --> 00:38:29,524
And what does your
so-called Draigar wisdom tell you?

405
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,865
That I have been an even
bigger fool than you have!

406
00:39:13,205 --> 00:39:15,866
We... we can hear you?

407
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,407
Of course.

408
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:20,444
Humans are not the only
ones who can communicate.

409
00:39:20,512 --> 00:39:22,308
But Xenoz never
said anything about...

410
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:23,607
Xenoz!

411
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,649
That treacherous wizard's
words are nothing

412
00:39:26,717 --> 00:39:28,776
but betrayal and deceit.

413
00:39:28,852 --> 00:39:31,877
Is that why he sent you two
rather than his Vorgans?

414
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:34,017
His Vorgans?

415
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,921
He said they were yours!

416
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,986
You shall see soon enough
where their true allegiance lies.

417
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:42,427
But they have my father!

418
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:43,486
And mine!

419
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:45,465
That's why we were
after the Aurathon.

420
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:46,795
Xenoz told us...

421
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:50,666
Xenoz knew I had hidden it.

422
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:53,501
That's why he sent you
on this fool's errand.

423
00:39:53,573 --> 00:39:55,803
He knew you would be captured...

424
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,843
he hoped that I would reveal

425
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:00,175
its hiding place to you.

426
00:40:00,246 --> 00:40:01,542
Of course!

427
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:03,706
The scrying crystal!

428
00:40:03,782 --> 00:40:05,010
Blast!

429
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,347
Gortaz! Attack!

430
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:15,958
So what... what are you
going to do with us?

431
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:18,586
Nothing... here.

432
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:24,032
We're about to have company.

433
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:04,925
These guys are definitely
not your buddies.

434
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:11,299
Release us! We can help you!

435
00:41:38,131 --> 00:41:39,063
Nice work.

436
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,656
You mean, "for a Norvagen?"

437
00:41:41,735 --> 00:41:43,259
What else would I mean?

438
00:41:43,336 --> 00:41:44,267
Listen, lanky...

439
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:46,065
Stop it, both of you.

440
00:41:46,138 --> 00:41:48,402
We are approaching
a sacred place.

441
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:11,215
Here?

442
00:42:11,294 --> 00:42:12,659
Doesn't look like much.

443
00:42:12,728 --> 00:42:15,253
It is the Ring of Oroborus.

444
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:18,128
Most sacred of all
the dragon temples.

445
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,598
Impossible!

446
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:23,331
The ring of Oroborus has been
abandoned for a thousand years!

447
00:42:23,405 --> 00:42:25,531
The legends say it was magical,

448
00:42:25,606 --> 00:42:27,801
that only the Dragon King
could open it.

449
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:30,673
Indeed?

450
00:43:32,698 --> 00:43:36,963
I am the Dragon King.

451
00:43:40,505 --> 00:43:44,099
And it is time you
faced your destiny!

452
00:43:49,646 --> 00:43:52,614
You traitorous wizard!

453
00:43:52,682 --> 00:43:55,276
These are dragon bones!

454
00:43:55,351 --> 00:43:58,911
You are the one who has been
killing the remaining dragons!

455
00:43:58,987 --> 00:44:01,512
Their crystals add to my power,

456
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,787
and besides, Vorgans need to eat.

457
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,349
That is inhuman!

458
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,360
I've done worse.

459
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:14,867
Of course, the Aurathon would be
the mightiest crystal of all.

460
00:44:14,934 --> 00:44:18,028
Only Thoron knows where it is.

461
00:44:18,104 --> 00:44:20,197
But since your blasted children

462
00:44:20,273 --> 00:44:22,104
fought off my Vorgans,

463
00:44:22,174 --> 00:44:25,803
I'm having a little
trouble locating him.

464
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:29,780
Well, good for them!
Both of them!

465
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:32,645
May our children bring you
a well-deserved defeat!

466
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:34,912
Oh, shut up.

467
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:46,060
When we gave Xenoz the power
to utilize the dragon crystals,

468
00:44:46,128 --> 00:44:47,925
it was only because we felt

469
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:50,522
it would help bring
peace, shared wisdom

470
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,863
and knowledge between our worlds.

471
00:44:52,935 --> 00:44:56,233
Little did we know how
such power would corrupt him.

472
00:44:59,074 --> 00:45:01,735
<i>Xenoz conspired with Stendahl,</i>

473
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:05,267
<i>an evil dragon whose</i>
<i>power was strength,</i>

474
00:45:05,345 --> 00:45:11,442
<i>to slay my queen and</i>
<i>take her ice crystal.</i>

475
00:45:11,517 --> 00:45:14,884
<i>This was the horrific</i>
<i>sight that greeted my eyes</i>

476
00:45:14,954 --> 00:45:18,150
<i>when I arrived.</i>

477
00:45:21,827 --> 00:45:24,990
<i>In my fury, I flamed them,</i>

478
00:45:25,063 --> 00:45:28,122
<i>but it was not enough.</i>

479
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:30,827
No wonder you went
back to the Dragon World.

480
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:34,165
Stendahl was imprisoned
for a thousand years.

481
00:45:34,237 --> 00:45:37,934
But the vengeance in his
evil heart only grew.

482
00:45:38,007 --> 00:45:39,907
When he was
finally released,

483
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:43,240
his first act was
to attack me again.

484
00:45:43,312 --> 00:45:45,906
<i>He and I almost</i>
<i>destroyed each other.</i>

485
00:45:45,981 --> 00:45:48,609
<i>But in the battle,</i>
<i>the Aurathon was activated,</i>

486
00:45:48,684 --> 00:45:50,275
<i>opening the portal</i>
<i>to this world.</i>

487
00:45:50,351 --> 00:45:54,151
<i>I stopped him, but I was</i>
<i>hurled through myself.</i>

488
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:01,018
And then you
bumped into us.

489
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,584
Literally.

490
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:06,088
<i>And it was well that I did.</i>

491
00:46:09,101 --> 00:46:11,797
<i>For I learned that</i>
<i>the traitor Xenoz still lived,</i>

492
00:46:11,871 --> 00:46:13,804
<i>protected by the gift of immortality</i>

493
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:16,204
<i>we dragons bestowed upon him.</i>

494
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:19,368
<i>It was known he would</i>
<i>seek the Aurathon,</i>

495
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:22,810
<i>and I was too injured to fight him.</i>

496
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,475
<i>Into myself I absorbed the crystal,</i>

497
00:46:30,653 --> 00:46:32,848
<i>and there divided it.</i>

498
00:46:32,922 --> 00:46:35,948
<i>And thus, the great gem was hidden...</i>

499
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:38,185
<i>in two vessels,</i>

500
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,752
<i>which would soon be miles apart.</i>

501
00:46:42,931 --> 00:46:46,331
You mean the Aurathon's in us?

502
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,301
But how could you do such a thing?

503
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,930
I had little choice.

504
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:54,599
If Xenoz obtains the Aurathon,

505
00:46:54,674 --> 00:46:56,938
he can open the portal.

506
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,877
Combined with his other
crystals of power,

507
00:46:59,946 --> 00:47:03,972
no dragon or human will be
able to stand against him.

508
00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:08,109
It would mean doom
for both our worlds.

509
00:47:08,186 --> 00:47:12,714
So that explains these strange abilities of ours!

510
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,281
The Aurathon's powers are elemental.

511
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,759
Earth, wind, fire, water.

512
00:47:18,828 --> 00:47:21,922
I gave you each the ability for one,

513
00:47:21,998 --> 00:47:24,397
in the hopes it might help you survive.

514
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:27,765
It has, but we can't
really control them.

515
00:47:27,836 --> 00:47:30,771
That is the role of Oroborus!

516
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:33,602
To unlock and
focus these powers!

517
00:47:33,675 --> 00:47:34,835
Behold!

518
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:54,217
Yes!

519
00:47:54,293 --> 00:47:56,157
Now this has potential...

520
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:24,410
You need to concentrate.

521
00:48:25,988 --> 00:48:27,614
And as for you...

522
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:29,451
- relax.

523
00:48:29,523 --> 00:48:31,354
The power is part of you.

524
00:48:31,425 --> 00:48:34,258
Feel it, don't try to command it.

525
00:48:47,706 --> 00:48:50,231
So... what made you choose us?

526
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:51,900
Targon and Aurora.

527
00:48:53,478 --> 00:48:56,311
They saw in you
a unity of purpose...

528
00:48:56,381 --> 00:48:57,439
a desire for peace,

529
00:48:57,515 --> 00:49:00,915
even at the cost of yourselves.

530
00:49:08,057 --> 00:49:10,890
This is greatness...

531
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,827
a greatness that may yet
save your kingdoms.

532
00:49:25,072 --> 00:49:27,472
Or may not.

533
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:30,336
Oops.

534
00:49:42,921 --> 00:49:44,718
The Ring of Oroborus!

535
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,417
They must be within! Gortaz!

536
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:52,455
Launch your squadron.
And take these.

537
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:25,150
Aurora? What is it, girl?

538
00:50:29,428 --> 00:50:31,157
Aurora? Hey!

539
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:42,730
Ahh, that should do it, boy.

540
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,570
In a few weeks,
you'll be good as new.

541
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,604
No! Hold still!

542
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,206
You're not well yet

543
00:51:02,023 --> 00:51:03,183
No!

544
00:51:21,507 --> 00:51:24,067
I still don't see
what you're worried about.

545
00:51:24,143 --> 00:51:26,008
You've got your strength back,

546
00:51:26,078 --> 00:51:28,012
we can control our powers,

547
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,707
and Xenoz may not even
know we're here!

548
00:51:41,491 --> 00:51:43,425
Well, two out of three, ain't bad!

549
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,683
Quickly! On my back!

550
00:52:36,272 --> 00:52:37,398
I've got this!

551
00:52:41,477 --> 00:52:43,809
We have to get
out of here, now!

552
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,843
Look! It's Targon!

553
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,477
And Aurora!

554
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,717
Kill the dragons!

555
00:53:15,206 --> 00:53:16,230
Thank you!

556
00:53:16,307 --> 00:53:18,639
Thank you, both of you!

557
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,510
We'll take it from here!

558
00:53:21,578 --> 00:53:24,138
Temper your confidence.

559
00:53:24,214 --> 00:53:27,206
Xenoz is certain to have
prepared for our arrival.

560
00:53:57,777 --> 00:54:02,213
What? Your foolhardy children
think to challenge me?

561
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:04,749
Our children?

562
00:54:04,816 --> 00:54:06,181
Both of them?

563
00:54:06,251 --> 00:54:07,581
- Together!
- Together!

564
00:54:07,652 --> 00:54:10,086
What a team they'll make!

565
00:54:11,088 --> 00:54:14,546
A short-lived one, I promise you.

566
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,427
To your posts!

567
00:54:47,153 --> 00:54:49,018
Ice!

568
00:54:49,088 --> 00:54:50,555
Hear me!

569
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:54,417
Rise and do my bidding!

570
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,587
Ice dragons.

571
00:56:12,662 --> 00:56:13,719
Can you take them?

572
00:56:13,795 --> 00:56:15,626
Not with you two on my back.

573
00:56:15,697 --> 00:56:17,631
Then just get us over the castle!

574
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:19,530
We'll take it from there!

575
00:57:03,405 --> 00:57:06,101
What do ya say, Draigar,
are you ready?

576
00:57:06,175 --> 00:57:08,075
After you, Norvagen!

577
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:59,679
Feel the icy rage of
my wrath, Dragon King!

578
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:01,154
I shall...

579
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:20,805
Destroy them!

580
00:59:00,474 --> 00:59:01,907
What?

581
00:59:01,975 --> 00:59:03,806
How do you have such powers?

582
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:05,742
That's for us to know...

583
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:07,780
And you to find out!

584
00:59:12,819 --> 00:59:14,979
And find out I shall!

585
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:28,826
Now, let us see what
is in your minds...

586
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,603
Of course!

587
00:59:46,647 --> 00:59:48,774
The Aurathon!

588
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:50,283
Divided in two,

589
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:53,149
and under my nose this whole time!

590
00:59:53,221 --> 00:59:56,121
Very clever, Thoron...

591
00:59:56,189 --> 00:59:58,714
but not clever enough!

592
01:00:08,133 --> 01:00:09,794
You monster!

593
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:21,605
The Aurathon.

594
01:00:21,678 --> 01:00:24,078
Greatest of all the dragon crystals!

595
01:00:24,147 --> 01:00:25,978
And it is mine!

596
01:01:54,592 --> 01:01:55,581
Xenoz?

597
01:02:26,787 --> 01:02:29,187
My queen...

598
01:02:38,264 --> 01:02:39,754
Gortaz,

599
01:02:41,767 --> 01:02:42,699
thanks...

600
01:02:42,768 --> 01:02:44,565
for the hand...

601
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:06,613
What the?

602
01:03:06,689 --> 01:03:10,420
That's right, this is
the work of Thoron!

603
01:03:11,594 --> 01:03:14,391
The dragons gave me immortality,

604
01:03:14,462 --> 01:03:16,327
but I could not heal,

605
01:03:16,398 --> 01:03:17,387
and for this,

606
01:03:19,834 --> 01:03:22,597
I shall have my revenge!

607
01:03:25,539 --> 01:03:28,507
Let the portal to the
Dragon World be opened!

608
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:55,491
No!

609
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:56,725
Too late, Thoron!

610
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:05,906
You were a fool to let these children
retain the Aurathon!

611
01:04:05,974 --> 01:04:10,307
Now you cannot defeat me
and they are helpless!

612
01:04:10,378 --> 01:04:11,709
Are they?

613
01:04:11,779 --> 01:04:13,906
You question me?

614
01:04:13,981 --> 01:04:16,642
I, who for a thousand years

615
01:04:16,716 --> 01:04:20,152
have manipulated their
ancestors like puppets?

616
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,687
I took their dragons

617
01:04:21,755 --> 01:04:24,882
and they blamed each
other, as I intended.

618
01:04:24,957 --> 01:04:26,083
I know how they think,

619
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:28,183
I know how they feel,

620
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,023
I know what they can do.

621
01:04:30,096 --> 01:04:31,995
They are but weak humans

622
01:04:32,063 --> 01:04:34,395
and they can do nothing!

623
01:04:34,466 --> 01:04:36,229
I beg to differ, traitor.

624
01:04:36,301 --> 01:04:39,428
They are Prince Dev
and Princess Kyra

625
01:04:39,503 --> 01:04:43,030
and they have been chosen
by the dragons themselves!

626
01:04:43,974 --> 01:04:45,305
Behold!

627
01:04:59,554 --> 01:05:00,486
What?

628
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:06,086
No! Give it to me!

629
01:05:07,928 --> 01:05:09,418
You got it!

630
01:06:13,952 --> 01:06:15,010
The ice castle!

631
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:16,451
It's coming down!

632
01:06:16,521 --> 01:06:18,148
Then lets get off of here.

633
01:06:18,223 --> 01:06:19,349
Now!

634
01:06:45,479 --> 01:06:48,573
May the peace and
trust they brought us

635
01:06:48,649 --> 01:06:51,846
last a thousand years and more!

636
01:06:51,919 --> 01:06:55,615
To Prince Dev and princess Kyra!

637
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,655
Hail Princess Kyra!

638
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:16,336
Well, what are we gonna do now?

639
01:07:17,407 --> 01:07:20,103
My whole life has been
fighting the Draigar.

640
01:07:20,177 --> 01:07:21,769
Is there anything else?

641
01:07:21,845 --> 01:07:24,279
I guess that's what
we're going to find out.

642
01:07:24,348 --> 01:07:27,783
Still, Xenoz told the
truth about one thing...

643
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:29,647
Your wish
about the legend?

644
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:31,619
Laugh if you want,

645
01:07:31,687 --> 01:07:33,278
but I always dreamed that someday,

646
01:07:33,355 --> 01:07:35,448
if the dragons came back,

647
01:07:35,523 --> 01:07:38,822
this is the place
where I'd see it.

648
01:07:38,893 --> 01:07:41,190
You mean like that?

649
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:08,476
The dragons are
returning! The legend!

650
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:10,179
It's true!

651
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:11,653
To peace!

652
01:08:11,722 --> 01:08:12,915
To us!

653
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,896
To dragons forever!

654
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:48,343
This is not over!

655
01:08:49,305 --> 01:09:49,152
