3
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,266
Here he comes!

4
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,285
Hail Mary,

5
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,411
full of grace,

6
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:04,662
the Lord is with thee.

7
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,205
Blessed art thou
among women,

8
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,082
blessed is the Lord,
Jesus Christ.

9
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,589
We've been
expecting you.

10
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,924
I'm Alan Elbourne,
and I'm the one

11
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,968
that summoned you here
today for this reason...

12
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:24,474
Go on.

13
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm listening.

14
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,272
It's about my sister
Charlotte.

15
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,901
Two nights ago,
she disappeared.

16
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:37,695
She was in bed, sleeping.

17
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,905
It was the middle
of the night.

18
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,408
Several people told us they saw
a carriage outside our house.

19
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,368
The carriage...

20
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,580
belonged to Meier Link,
the vampire.

21
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,334
I organized a search party
of fifty men,

22
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,169
but it was no use.
We couldn't find them.

23
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,129
We were ambushed.

24
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,131
Hyah!

25
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,475
He took my sister
and killed my friends.

26
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:12,688
That's just a down payment.

27
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,690
You'll get the rest
when you find her...

28
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,276
$10 million.

29
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,862
But you better move fast.

30
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,239
You've got
some competition.

31
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,157
I've hired
the Markus brothers,

32
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,659
and they've got
a head start on you.

33
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,452
I don't think so.

34
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:27,495
Huh?

35
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,539
It may be too late
for her.

36
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,958
Your sister may already
have been tempted.

37
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:32,583
What then?

38
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,504
You have to get there
before that happens!

39
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,422
- What do you think we're paying you for?
- That's enough!

40
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,970
My son is emotional.
Please excuse him.

41
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,930
This has been difficult
for all of us.

42
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,723
If you knew my daughter,
you'd understand.

43
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,267
She's kind and beautiful

44
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:52,061
and her loss is more
than this old soul can bear.

45
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,981
Now I need to ask
you something.

46
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,732
If you find her changed,

47
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,026
can you see that her death
is without suffering?

48
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,528
Be kind to her, please.

49
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,697
No. No!
We can't do that!

50
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:03,614
It isn't right!

51
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,700
No, she won't
be changed.

52
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,411
- You're talking about your daughter!
- Alan, listen to me.

53
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,830
It's not easy
to ask him for this,

54
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,957
but it's something
that must be done.

55
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,918
I'm sorry.
You understand.

56
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,380
I understand
your position, but...

57
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,507
$10 million is not enough.

58
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:22,466
What?!

59
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,093
How dare you?!

60
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,096
Stop it!
Hold your fire!

61
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,347
I said stop!

62
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,772
I'll double the price.

63
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:38,900
I'll give you
20 million.

64
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:43,112
Just bring her back,
one way or the other.

65
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,064
Aah! Aah!

66
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:20,191
Did you see a carriage
go by here

67
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,068
with four horses
in front?

68
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,069
Uh-uh.

69
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,737
Let me go!

70
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,238
L-Let me go!

71
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:27,949
Aah!

72
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,158
You're lying.

73
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,214
Oh, damn.
We got company...

74
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,559
Lots of company.

75
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:46,444
Look out!

76
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,243
Oh, man.
ls everybody OK?

77
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:54,994
Yeah.

78
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:55,536
Uh-huh.

79
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,288
Do you believe that?

80
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,540
The place
is overrun with them.

81
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,917
He must've been here
already.

82
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,295
Well, come on.

83
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,925
Ready or not,
here they come.

84
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,845
It's zombie time.

85
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:15,931
Yeah!

86
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,558
Come and get it,
zombies!

87
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:19,977
Amen to that.

88
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:22,021
Leila, are you there?

89
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:23,647
It won't take long,
Grove.

90
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,232
Just stay in the tank.

91
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,365
Lock and load.

92
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:48,589
Uhh!

93
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:12,321
Yaah!

94
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,788
Not so fast, buddy.

95
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,375
And... fire.

96
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:29,338
Gotcha.

97
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,636
Rest in peace. Huh?

98
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,556
You hear that?

99
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:41,934
Sounds like a horse.

100
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,020
It's moving.
Uphill.

101
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,856
Let me try.

102
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,156
Right.

103
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,616
Right about...

104
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,034
Hmm.

105
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:04,707
Right there.

106
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:14,466
Huh?

107
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,988
Beautiful,
just beautiful.

108
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,907
I applaud you, stranger.

109
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,658
Tell me what
you're doing here.

110
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,411
If we're in the same game,
we should be friends.

111
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:43,913
Tell me your name.

112
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,082
Mine's Borgoff-
Borgoff Markus.

113
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,168
D-

114
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,967
Ah, so that's the guy-
the dunpeal hunter.

115
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,928
I've heard about him.
He's amazing.

116
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,096
Wake up, Borgoff.
He's the competition,

117
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,306
not some buddy of ours.

118
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,891
Come on,
what are we doing here?

119
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,392
We just helped him.
Think about it.

120
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,895
Yeah, he's right.
I agree with him about that.

121
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,481
We help him too much, and
he'll take all the money.

122
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,858
If it wasn't for us,
he'd be dead by now.

123
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,236
We do the work,
and he gets the reward.

124
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,905
Aw, you boys
should relax.

125
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:21,242
We just did the famous
dunpeal a little favor is all.

126
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,118
A little favor
we can't afford.

127
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,828
Hey, you ever
hear the one

128
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,413
about the owl
and the squirrel?

129
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:27,915
The squirrel
works all summer

130
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,541
storing away stuff
for the winter,

131
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,126
all kinds of
nuts and seeds.

132
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,211
He works real hard.

133
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,505
Then one day, just
before the first snow,

134
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,548
he goes outside for
one last look around,

135
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,676
when all of a sudden,
this owl swoops down

136
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:40,427
and grabs him,
carries him off.

137
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,430
"Ah, what a shame,"
says the squirrel.

138
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,515
"What's going to happen

139
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:45,766
to all
that good food?"

140
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,686
Heh heh heh heh!

141
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,482
Ha ha!

142
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,488
<i>Ah,
that's a good one.</i>

143
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,115
Yeah, hilarious.

144
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,034
You get it, you guys?

145
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,161
That stupid squirrel
is all, like-huh?

146
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,163
Leila.

147
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,957
Hey, Leila,
what's the rush?

148
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,462
What's with her?

149
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:23,804
So you're
outnumbered 4 to 1.

150
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:24,722
So what?

151
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,348
They do have
a head start,

152
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,725
but when
the sun comes up,

153
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,351
the heat
will slow 'em down.

154
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,105
Speaking of sun and heat,

155
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,857
I know I don't need
to remind you

156
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,358
of your susceptibility.

157
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,068
It's called
heat syndrome,

158
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:41,864
- and the last time you ignored it, you almost-
Don't worry.

159
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,533
I hate it
when you say that.

160
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,618
What-what are those?
Tracks?

161
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:47,494
Let me see.

162
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,457
Yes. These are definitely
their tracks.

163
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:53,917
6 hours old, I'd say.

164
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,544
OK. Uhh.

165
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,213
I'm suffocating now.

166
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,051
Hey, what was that?

167
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,011
That's funny.

168
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,804
I could've sworn
I heard something.

169
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:06,847
Quiet.

170
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,225
Sandmantas,
most likely.

171
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,563
Aah! Aah!

172
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,983
Aah!

173
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,403
Great flesh!
Sandmantas galore.

174
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,405
Talk about
your prehistoric pigeons.

175
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,367
They're filthy animals.
You know, they're just filthy.

176
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,619
Well, I guess we'd better
just turn back.

177
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,121
It's a shame, really,
'cause, you know,

178
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,582
we could've-
hey, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

179
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,709
Hey! No, no.

180
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,461
Go back, man.
Go back.

181
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,588
Come on.
You're crazy!

182
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:40,839
Come on, man.

183
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,132
Please,
let's just go back.

184
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,385
No, no!
Here we go! Oh!

185
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,931
Yaah! Not wise.

186
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,477
Yaah!

187
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:54,853
Aah!

188
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,230
Ohh!

189
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,649
All right, that's enough.

190
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,192
That was good.
OK, now, we survived that.

191
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:00,859
Could we stop?

192
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,780
Did you ever hear
the expression

193
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,781
"Too close for comfort"?

194
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,699
'Cause that was
damn uncomfortable.

195
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:24,550
What is it?

196
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,301
A resting house?

197
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,554
I didn't think anybody
had those anymore.

198
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,097
He must be in there.

199
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,516
Wow, it blends in nicely.

200
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:05,924
OK. Whoa.

201
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,259
Here we are.

202
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,430
OK, I can see 'em.

203
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,390
How many are there?

204
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,767
Two, I think-

205
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,687
- a man and a woman.
- Look out for the exit door.

206
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,439
OK. No door.

207
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,024
No door there.

208
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,233
Still no door.

209
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:24,943
No.

210
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,704
Are you sure
about that door?

211
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,879
No. No.

212
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,014
What was that?

213
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,490
She's out of her mind!

214
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,872
Door! Door!

215
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,082
You're dead!

216
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,003
Aah! Aah!

217
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,263
Uhh!

218
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:37,099
Uhh! Ohh! Uhh! Uhh!

219
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,254
I'm here
for the young woman.

220
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,383
I wouldn't recommend it,
dunpeal.

221
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,260
Taking on a vampire
at night

222
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,345
is a mission
for morons and fools.

223
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,221
Which are you?

224
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,440
She's here by
her own choice, dunpeal.

225
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,650
So unless
you're the kind of man

226
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,403
who would take a woman
against her will for the money in it-

227
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,280
and I'm sure
it's a lot-

228
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,866
I suggest you save
your sorry ass now

229
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,201
and leave us
to travel in peace.

230
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,371
I would if I could
believe you, Meier.

231
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,165
Your credibility,
however,

232
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:46,376
is less than impeccable
under the circumstances.

233
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,503
You kidnapped the girl.

234
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,089
Aah!

235
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:57,554
Meier!

236
00:18:59,014 --> 00:18:59,931
Aah!

237
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,560
Uhh!
Ow, my nose! My nose!

238
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,647
What happened?
What'd I miss?

239
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:08,982
She called out
his name.

240
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,151
It may be true,
what he said.

241
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,403
Nah,
she's just ignorant.

242
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,031
She's a child.
She doesn't know him yet.

243
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,533
She doesn't know
what he's capable of.

244
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:28,418
Ooh.

245
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,425
Oh, that poor girl.

246
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,969
She's-she's bleeding
pretty bad.

247
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,138
I mean,
she won't last long.

248
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,140
It's a shame, really...

249
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,059
To waste all
that good blood, I mean.

250
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,395
Come on, admit it.

251
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:47,813
You're tempted.

252
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,690
I mean, I know you are.

253
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,441
Uhh...

254
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:52,442
Ma.

255
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:53,777
Mmm.

256
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:55,696
Mother.

257
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,490
Wait. I was
just kidding, you know?

258
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,659
Come on, let's go.
We got work to do.

259
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,119
The money-come on,
think of the money.

260
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,375
Huh?

261
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,633
Uhh.

262
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,726
Hey, what did you
do to me?

263
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,937
I bound your wound
and stopped your bleeding.

264
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:29,938
That's all.

265
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,398
Oh, I get it.

266
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,735
You think
you can just go ahead

267
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,154
and tear off the clothes
of whoever you come across.

268
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,364
That's what you think,
isn't it, dunpeal?

269
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,951
You should go back home
and nurse your wounds.

270
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,578
What are you,
my mother?

271
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,497
You called out
for your mother before.

272
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,374
I thought you might be
needing her.

273
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:51,877
Hey!

274
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,671
Uhh. Uhh.

275
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,465
Uhh.

276
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,432
I see her.

277
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,365
When the last
vampire is extinct,

278
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,451
who will mourn
our passing?

279
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:25,786
Will she?

280
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,579
Will anyone?

281
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,961
Can anyone understand
this pain, this loneliness?

282
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,366
I told you so,
didn't I?

283
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,785
Hmm? I said
leave the girl alone.

284
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:07,911
She's trouble.

285
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:10,121
She's competition,
you know.

286
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,791
You aided and abetted
the enemy.

287
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,678
I hope this is
the right way.

288
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,137
Trust me.
I know how they think,

289
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,931
these vampires.
When they're threatened,

290
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,516
they all head
for Barbarois.

291
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:30,934
They're so predictable.

292
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,352
Barbarois, yeah.

293
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,979
I really hate that place.

294
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:36,314
It's full of lunatics
and monsters

295
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,233
and that old crazy man,
you know?

296
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,239
Does it hurt
very much, Leila?

297
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,157
Leila?

298
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:47,367
Huh?

299
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,036
Your injury-
does it hurt you?

300
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:51,580
Oh, no,
it's fine.

301
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,205
Inn-

302
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,001
Grove,
you should lie down.

303
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,794
You look tired.
You need to rest.

304
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:58,962
Don't worry
about me.

305
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:00,797
Leila...

306
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:04,050
Who dressed the wound?
Was it him?

307
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,178
You can tell me.

308
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,431
It was him, wasn't it?
The dunpeal hunter?

309
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,515
Mm-hmm.

310
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,767
Leila,
I'm warning you-

311
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,020
He-he's trouble.
He's against us.

312
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,897
I don't know
why he did that.

313
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,818
Grove, please don't
tell anyone, OK?

314
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,786
He stopped there,

315
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:33,330
but what for?

316
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,248
Let's find out.

317
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:37,417
Nolt and Kyle,
you come with me.

318
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,461
Leila, you stay in here
with Grove.

319
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:42,172
OK, is everybody ready?

320
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,506
- Always.
- Ready. Yeah.

321
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,829
Hey, Nolt,

322
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,665
see what's going on
in there, will you?

323
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,041
It may be a trap.

324
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,210
Yeah.
We'll cover you.

325
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,337
It'll be my pleasure,
gentlemen.

326
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,771
Aah!

327
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:46,403
Huh?

328
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,244
It's nothing but
a lousy piece of cloth.

329
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,162
What the hell?

330
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,415
Bastard.
Unbelievable.

331
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,667
Hey, watch out!

332
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,043
Huh?

333
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,587
So...

334
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:09,050
You dare to enter
Barbarois.

335
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:13,304
I assume it's arrogance
and not stupidity

336
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,141
that brings you here,
gentlemen.

337
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:19,102
Or perhaps
it's ignorance.

338
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:22,564
You're skillful hunters,
I can see,

339
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:25,900
but you are no match
for the Barbarois.

340
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:31,698
5,000 years of isolation
have made us invincible.

341
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,036
Aah! Uhh!

342
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,959
Huh?

343
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:43,752
What?

344
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:51,634
What the hell's going on?

345
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,599
The shadow...

346
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,062
Watch out
for the shadow.

347
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,646
What are you
talking about?

348
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,607
The shadow?
What do you mean?

349
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,319
Hey, Nolt?

350
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,331
Hey, Nolt, what the hell
happened to you, huh?

351
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,000
He-he's dead.

352
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,126
No, he's not!

353
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,545
Come on, Nolt.
Come on!

354
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,839
Snap out of it!
Come on!

355
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,343
Oh, my god!
Damn it, come on!

356
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,261
I need you!

357
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:37,931
Oh, God!

358
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,224
Oh!

359
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,491
Oh, God,
we're getting close.

360
00:26:56,866 --> 00:27:00,245
Those are the windmills
of the Barbarois.

361
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:01,788
I really wish
you'd turn back.

362
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,706
There must be
another way.

363
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:05,333
There isn't.

364
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:21,015
I am D the hunter.

365
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,560
I have business
with the Barbarois.

366
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,306
Oh, no.

367
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,566
So, I see
you have dismounted.

368
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:13,234
You have respect
for your elders.

369
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,320
That's very considerate
indeed.

370
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,243
I want you to stop
your protection

371
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,245
of Meier Link.

372
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,205
You what?

373
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:28,708
Ha ha ha. You know,
you make me laugh.

374
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,667
That's a good one.

375
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,253
I see you are
a very humorous young man.

376
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,713
And beautiful, too,
I might add.

377
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,173
Or does that make you
uncomfortable

378
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:37,550
to have an old lech
like me admire you so?

379
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,469
You take me for a fool.

380
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,638
Someone paid me
$100 million

381
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:42,972
to protect Meier Link.

382
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,057
Can you top that?

383
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:47,018
Well, you drive a hard
bargain there, old man.

384
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:49,854
What if I can?

385
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:53,816
You really are entertaining me,
Mr. Stranger.

386
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,319
I suppose you know
our reputation.

387
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,322
The Barbarois serve
the people of the night,

388
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,616
and after 5,000 years,

389
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,910
I don't think we're about
to change our stripes

390
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,702
any time soon.

391
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,204
Although,
if we did for anyone,

392
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:07,121
it would be for you.

393
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,458
I have seen
many a dunpeal,

394
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:13,211
but somebody like you,
I've never seen before.

395
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,380
That's why
it's such a pity

396
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,048
that you have to die.

397
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:19,550
I really can't let you
leave here alive,

398
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,385
now, can I?

399
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:23,054
I'm afraid you
have to die, stranger.

400
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:24,305
So sorry.

401
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:27,558
The Barbarois
are great warriors.

402
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,310
You are a warrior, too,
no doubt,

403
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,895
and although
you may kill some of us,

404
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,355
in the end,
we will prevail.

405
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:34,274
I have sworn
to protect the carriage.

406
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,317
Prepare to die.

407
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:45,660
Fool.

408
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:47,662
What's he doing
in there?

409
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,748
Borgoff,
are we ready yet?

410
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:53,543
Grove...

411
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:56,879
We have no choice.

412
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,423
We need your help
on this, Grove.

413
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,216
Think you can do it
there, man?

414
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,554
Give it to me.
I'm waiting.

415
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,599
Don't push yourself
too hard now.

416
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,767
I mean it, OK?

417
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:10,768
I want you back.

418
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,526
You know,
I really have

419
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,862
nothing against
the Barbarois personally.

420
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,323
It's a shame I'll have
to kill so many of you.

421
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,908
Indeed,
I admire your loyalty

422
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,201
and your devotion
to duty.

423
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,120
Yet I wonder
about the fairness

424
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,581
when you allow one
to fight against so many.

425
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,083
But if that
will entertain you...

426
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,711
Ohh.

427
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,004
I see.

428
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,007
Well, you make
a good argument, young man.

429
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,342
How interesting.

430
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,218
Old man...

431
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:47,096
I think the fellow
is right.

432
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,265
Please allow
the three of us

433
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,267
to entertain
our young guest here,

434
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,853
unless he thinks
that's unfair.

435
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:56,314
Three against one-
how unfair.

436
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:58,691
Three against one-
unfair.

437
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:00,109
That's enough.

438
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:03,696
You mock us with your
ridiculous antics, Benge.

439
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,406
I will not have you

440
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,116
distracting us
from the job at hand,

441
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:08,826
which is the protection
of the carriage.

442
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,204
We'll do things
my way. Huh?

443
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,587
What the devil is that?

444
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:40,024
Go for it, Grove!
Go for it!

445
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:41,734
Kill all those guys!

446
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,152
Kill every last
one of them!

447
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,241
Come on, Grove.

448
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:49,200
Hold on.

449
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,002
Get the carriage out, now!

450
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,759
Follow me, Tinkerbell.

451
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,013
I'm waiting for you.

452
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:13,766
Uhh!

453
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,602
Yaah!

454
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:37,206
Grove.

455
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,926
I've got to say this,

456
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:51,387
I admire that young
hunter's spirit,

457
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,347
although he doesn't
stand a chance

458
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:54,765
against Benge
and the others.

459
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,684
Still, it's a pity
I'll miss the show.

460
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,436
<i>Oh, well.
C'est la vie.</i>

461
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:32,220
Wake up, D.

462
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:33,930
What's wrong with you?

463
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,354
It's not fair.
It's not fair.

464
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:43,022
I'll show you
what's not fair.

465
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:45,608
Stay there
till you rot, hunter.

466
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,498
Aw, phooey, suckers.

467
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,586
Stop.
I beg you.

468
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,255
Say good night.

469
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:13,219
Kyle, did you happen to see
where that girl went?

470
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,845
Maybe she got caught
in the wheels.

471
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:15,846
Go look.

472
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:39,245
Aah!

473
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:00,558
Nice, Caroline,
very nice.

474
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,602
A little crude,
but effective.

475
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,145
They're all yours.

476
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,025
That freakin' monster.

477
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:11,193
Is everybody all right?

478
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:13,029
Yeah,
but Kyle was outside.

479
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:13,946
He was up on top.

480
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,161
Kyle. Kyle. Where the hell
are you, Kyle?

481
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,287
Down here.

482
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:22,705
You OK?

483
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:24,665
Quiet.
They're still around.

484
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,007
No.

485
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:36,719
Damn.
That idiot.

486
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,680
Well, how convenient
this is for me.

487
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,099
Come on out here
so I can finish the job.

488
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,225
Your time is up.

489
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:44,935
Come on, you cowards!

490
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:46,228
You're going to pay
for the pain

491
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,480
you caused my brother.

492
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,904
Hey,
D, are you awake?

493
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:01,243
I need your help

494
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,204
to swallow up
this spell.

495
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,208
You're a slave driver,
you know that?

496
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:27,269
Aah!

497
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,913
Hey, remember to watch out
for the shadow, huh?

498
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,582
Try and stay still.

499
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,292
Easier said
than done.

500
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,836
And keep
your mouth shut.

501
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,565
Aah! Aah! Ahh! Ahh!

502
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,191
That was close.

503
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:25,035
Waah!

504
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:30,708
Well, the tank
is full of holes.

505
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:32,960
The fuel's all gone.

506
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,712
We can't drive it
like this anyway.

507
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:35,880
What are we
going to do?

508
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:39,717
What should we do?

509
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,802
Borgoff, any idea?

510
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:46,182
How's Grove?

511
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,184
Honestly,
not too great.

512
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,602
Borgoff, wake up.

513
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:51,103
What are you thinking
about over there?

514
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,439
Oh, nothing, really.

515
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,107
I was just thinking
about the carriage.

516
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:56,859
Wonder where it is
by now.

517
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:58,527
Well hell, man,
at this point,

518
00:37:58,527 --> 00:37:59,862
it's pretty much
anybody's guess.

519
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,698
If you want my opinion,
I'd say they're either

520
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,784
setting sail
from the port of Ebral

521
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:05,785
or hiding somewhere

522
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,495
deep in the Granerj
mountain range.

523
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,330
I sure hope so.

524
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,918
Anyway, we still
have to get some fuel,

525
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:17,004
and the town of Garucia
isn't that far away from here.

526
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:19,048
Kyle, you go with Leila.

527
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,675
I'll stay here
and do the repairs.

528
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:36,816
"if you are seeking
the pathway to the stars,

529
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:40,361
"come to me. I pray
for your safe arrival

530
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,196
with all my heart."

531
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:46,116
"The pathway
to the stars..."

532
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:10,057
I don't know about
you, but I sure miss that horse.

533
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,017
What was his name?

534
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,895
Oh, the silent
treatment, huh?

535
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,606
Well, I got two words
heat syndrome.

536
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:19,984
Look. Look, I know
I'm a parasite,

537
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:21,861
but haven't I always been
a helpful parasite?

538
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,863
Now, you may not care
if you die from heat,

539
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,447
but becoming
a piece of beef jerky

540
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,116
is not a lifelong
ambition of mine.

541
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,869
Yeah, well, what's
the sound of one hand yapping?

542
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:43,591
How much?

543
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,259
Oh, no.
Keep your money.

544
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:47,052
Come on.
Just take it.

545
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:50,639
Let's go.

546
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:57,229
Leila! Oh, I see.

547
00:39:58,147 --> 00:39:59,398
It's him, isn't it?

548
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,860
Kyle, why don't you
start back without me?

549
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:05,738
There's something
I want to do here first.

550
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:10,492
Back off.

551
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:13,537
Have I told you
you're quite irresistible

552
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,205
in that sexy,
skintight getup?

553
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:17,249
No. Tell me about it.

554
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,417
I just did.

555
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:21,378
You make sure you watch
your back with that guy, Leila.

556
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:38,812
I'd like a beer.

557
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:55,371
I've just been admiring
your fancy weapon there.

558
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:59,416
Don't worry. I have no plans
to use it anytime soon.

559
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,752
That's good.
That's good,

560
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:05,631
because I have no plans
to let you keep it.

561
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:07,424
Give it up.

562
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,054
You heard me,
little girl.

563
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:15,099
Uhh!

564
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,107
Hmm. Thank you.

565
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,776
Well, here's to you,
sheriff.

566
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,277
I'd buy you
a drink, but-

567
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:29,321
Thank you,
but no, thanks.

568
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,615
Oh, OK.
I was just gonna say

569
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:32,950
you must
be awfully busy

570
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:36,370
with that new dunpeal
hunter in the town now.

571
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:38,539
What dunpeal hunter?

572
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:46,797
I'd like to buy
that horse.

573
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:52,136
$300,000.

574
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:55,014
And if you don't like
the price, go somewhere else.

575

Subtitle by anana

576
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:19,830
Freeze! Put your hands
where I can see 'em! Now!

577
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,500
Sheriff, he paid
good money for that.

578
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:30,174
What are you doing?

579
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:31,967
Take your money and go.

580
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,220
We don't want you here.

581
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,973
We don't sell to dunpeals
in this town.

582
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:39,850
Understand?

583
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,228
Understand me,
dunpeal?

584
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,065
You understand.

585
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:47,232
Wait a minute.

586
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,318
That's my horse you're
talking about there,

587
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,445
and I'll sell it
to whoever I want

588
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,405
if they can afford
the price I'm asking.

589
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:56,784
You can't do that.
We have laws against it, Polk-

590
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,203
good laws-
and for a damn good reason.

591
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,579
What laws?

592
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,082
Don't play coy,
Polk. You know as well as I,

593
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:04,750
dunpeals aren't allowed.

594
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,794
Not allowed. Right.

595
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:09,046
I remember a time
not that long ago

596
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:11,590
when we had vampires
and dunpeals both

597
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,133
around here, but...

598
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:15,636
And that's why
we have the law!

599
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:17,679
Listen to me whether
you want to hear it or not.

600
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,515
You weren't even born
when this happened.

601
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:22,017
Do yourself a favor
and listen to the story.

602
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,520
I'm going to tell you
about the time

603
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,105
when the children
were kidnapped.

604
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:29,191
There were ten children
altogether-

605
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:30,609
Yeah, I heard
about that time.

606
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:32,694
The kidnappers
turned out

607
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,530
to be vampires,
of course,

608
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,366
and so the townspeople
pooled their money

609
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:39,034
to hire
a vampire hunter.

610
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:40,619
They wanted the best.

611
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,122
And when
the hunter came,

612
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,624
he was a very strong
and quiet man,

613
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:47,709
and he did his job, too,

614
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,962
which was to return
the children safely back

615
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:51,588
into their parent's
homes.

616
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:53,215
It wasn't easy,

617
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,384
but many vampires
died by his hands

618
00:43:55,384 --> 00:43:57,302
before this job
was over with.

619
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:58,762
And when it was over

620
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:00,514
and the children
were back home,

621
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:02,307
the people
attacked the man.

622
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:05,227
They said he was a dunpeal
half-vampire himself,

623
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:06,812
so they punished him.

624
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:08,981
Can't say I blame them
for doing that.

625
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:13,235
You can't trust 'em.
That's all that's about.

626
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,237
They were right
about that part, Polk.

627
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:18,031
He did the job.

628
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,993
I see, then, I'll
have to take matters

629
00:44:20,993 --> 00:44:22,369
into my own hands.

630
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:23,328
Let him go!

631
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:25,622
And what is that?

632
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,000
What does it
look like, idiot?

633
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,209
Put down your guns!

634
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,253
Polk, you can't know
what you're doing.

635
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:32,212
Put it down.

636
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:34,214
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

637
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:37,551
You don't know!
Put it down now, you old fool!

638
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:41,722
I would much rather
be an old fool

639
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,348
than what you are,
sheriff.

640
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,186
Now, don't shoot.

641
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,522
I can tell you
I won't think twice

642
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:51,732
about using this weapon.

643
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,525
I might even enjoy it.

644
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:55,527
Get on your horse,
stranger.

645
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:56,820
Thank you.

646
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:00,741
No. It's only fitting
I thank you.

647
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:02,367
It's the least I can do.

648
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:07,122
I may be just an old
fool now, stranger,

649
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:09,750
but I could never forget
a face like yours.

650
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:11,335
And I'll never forget

651
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:12,794
what you done for me
back then.

652
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,129
That's right.

653
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,006
I was one of them kids.

654
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:23,931
And I always felt bad
about that.

655
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,809
The way you was treated.
How nobody stopped you.

656
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:30,562
Nobody thanked you.
Instead, the ignorant bastards

657
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,356
ran you
right out of our town.

658
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,358
So it's true, isn't it,

659
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:36,401
what they say
about you dunpeals?

660
00:45:37,194 --> 00:45:40,072
You don't age. Now, go.
I'm getting tired.

661
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:04,388
Where's Benge?
What's taking him so long?

662
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,057
Well, the horses
are rested now.

663
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:09,393
We better go. Come on.

664
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:16,984
Master, what is it?
May I help you, sir?

665
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:20,988
It's still light
outside, master!

666
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:23,907
What?

667
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:26,660
Leave her
alone, Machira.

668
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:27,911
Yes, sir.

669
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:32,207
She misses the sunlight.
Let her enjoy it.

670
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:18,712
I am D, a hunter.
Your father sent me.

671
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:22,341
Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

672
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:28,263
You sit in the sunlight.
You must not be changed.

673
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,350
So, why do you
stay with him?

674
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:33,477
Last night
in the carriage,

675
00:47:33,477 --> 00:47:34,561
you called out his name.

676
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:38,023
Why did you
call for him?

677
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,945
I suppose my father
has not told you

678
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,739
that I'm in love
with Meier.

679
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:47,908
You don't know
who he is.

680
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:49,826
You can't be
in love with him.

681
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:53,080
Well, I am. If you only knew
how good he's been to me.

682
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:54,998
I love him.

683
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,169
Please believe me.
No one else will.

684
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:02,714
You don't understand.

685
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:05,759
He is what he is,
Charlotte.

686
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,762
You can't change him.
He'll take you in time,

687
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:11,473
and when that happens,
I will have to kill you.

688
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:13,600
Fine. Kill me then.

689
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:16,728
I would rather die than
to go anywhere without him.

690
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,939
Don't take me back there!
I mean it!

691
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:21,191
I simply could not live
without Meier.

692
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,568
How sweet
that is. Ha!

693
00:48:25,195 --> 00:48:26,947
She loves a vampire.

694
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:30,200
So very sweet.

695
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:32,536
Idiot!

696
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:36,289
You stupid girl!
Get up! We're going!

697
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:37,707
Leave me alone!

698
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,293
You'll do what I say!

699
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:42,587
Do you have any idea
how many people have died

700
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,339
at the hands
of your beloved Meier,

701
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,715
this vampire
you want to protect?

702
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:46,258
None!

703
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:49,511
You fool! And you!

704
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,264
You stay right where
you are, my friend.

705
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:54,850
Sorry, but I really don't
want to have to share

706
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,184
any of my profits.

707
00:48:57,686 --> 00:48:59,312
You understand, don't you?

708
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:00,689
It's business.

709
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:08,780
Above you.

710
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:18,707
Aah!

711
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:41,730
What's wrong?
Tell me!

712
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:47,944
Too much sun!

713
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:56,119
I warned you about the heat,

714
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:57,787
but you don't listen!

715
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:13,136
Come on! You can't survive
unless you dig a hole!

716
00:50:13,345 --> 00:50:15,180
You need to bury yourself!

717
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,272
Oh! Ha ha ha ha!

718
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:00,267
Hurry!

719
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:39,472
Leila?
Leila, are you there?

720
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:40,974
Come in, Leila.

721
00:51:41,725 --> 00:51:42,684
Yeah, I copy.

722
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:44,561
Thank God!
Are you OK?

723
00:51:44,561 --> 00:51:45,729
What's your position?

724
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:47,772
I'm near Lake Chiffon.

725
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,441
Our game is heading
north from here.

726
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:50,775
We'll catch up.

727
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,986
Leila, do you know
what's happened

728
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:54,529
to the dunpeal hunter?

729
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,157
No. I haven't seen him.

730
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:59,034
All right.
Well, take care.

731
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:01,161
Stay in touch.
Borgoff out.

732
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,300
Ha!
The tables have turned.

733
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:31,399
Uhh!

734
00:52:42,452 --> 00:52:42,994
No!

735
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:51,878
Now, that
cleared my head.

736
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,255
I really should
return the favor,

737
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:55,715
don't you think, honey?

738
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:53,189
Don't get any ideas.

739
00:53:54,107 --> 00:53:56,276
Hey, I'm just trying
to stay dry here.

740
00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:58,945
If there was
any other place to go,

741
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:00,280
believe me, I'd be there.

742
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,906
As soon as the rain lets up,

743
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,908
I'll be gone from here
and from you.

744
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:12,917
I think I can guess
your problem.

745
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:16,463
Your family was
the victim of vampires.

746
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:19,424
You don't know what
you're talking about.

747
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,010
You don't know
anything about it.

748
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:25,513
All right.
Perhaps I don't.

749
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:29,768
This stupid thing,
it bothers me.

750
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,439
You really are a weird one,
you know that?

751
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:36,441
In spite of being
a dunpeal hunter

752
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:37,776
and all
that that entails.

753
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,653
How did you know
about my mother?

754
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:42,864
You called her name,
remember?

755
00:54:43,782 --> 00:54:45,658
She was
kidnapped by vampires.

756
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,202
My father went after her.

757
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:50,330
He was trying to rescue her,
so they killed him.

758
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:52,999
And after a while,
my mother returned,

759
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,918
but she wasn't
my mother anymore.

760
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:56,628
She'd been changed.

761
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:58,129
The people in the village

762
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:00,131
stoned her to death
while I watched.

763
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,800
After that, I left home.

764
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:03,593
I met
the Markus brothers

765
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:04,511
and joined with them.

766
00:55:04,511 --> 00:55:05,887
I wanted to be a hunter

767
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:07,847
to avenge
my parent's deaths.

768
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:10,225
I've seen many terrible
things since then-

769
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:11,559
lives destroyed,

770
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:14,020
families devastated,
hopes crushed.

771
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:17,398
Every time, it seems
a vampire is to blame.

772
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,402
I can understand why
you'd choose to do it,

773
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:24,030
but the life of a hunter's
no kind of life.

774
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:26,658
It's the only life
I'm any good for now,

775
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:27,408
and it looks like

776
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:29,202
it's the only life
you've ever known,

777
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:31,746
so I suggest
we make a pact.

778
00:55:32,288 --> 00:55:34,249
Since we're both in it
for the long haul,

779
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:37,001
whoever dies first,
the other one can come

780
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:40,171
and bring flowers to
their grave. How's that?

781
00:55:40,964 --> 00:55:43,925
It's the rain.
Makes me sentimental.

782
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:45,969
I don't know why I
should care about that.

783
00:55:45,969 --> 00:55:47,595
It's just
I love flowers,

784
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:49,556
and I don't think
I'll be getting any.

785
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:51,307
I'm all alone,
after all.

786
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,060
We have that much
in common, don't we?

787
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,104
That we're both hunters
and we're both alone?

788
00:55:56,938 --> 00:55:58,773
Oh, well.
I'm being silly.

789
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,400
It doesn't
really matter.

790
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:02,151
I'll do it.

791
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:06,155
I'll bring you flowers
if I survive this,

792
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:07,699
but I don't expect to.

793
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:10,243
Oh, stop. I didn't really
mean it when I said that.

794
00:56:10,702 --> 00:56:12,495
And anyway,
I don't really understand

795
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:14,163
why you should
keep on doing this.

796
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:19,502
Because I'm a dunpeal.

797
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:23,089
I don't get to have
a life, not like you.

798
00:56:56,331 --> 00:56:58,041
Well, with the rainstorm
last night,

799
00:56:58,041 --> 00:56:59,459
they can't
be too far away.

800
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:03,630
We're even now, dunpeal.
Understand?

801
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:15,683
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

802
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:16,851
How so?

803
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:20,605
I think I finally
figured it out, Borgoff.

804
00:57:22,023 --> 00:57:23,858
Well,
I'm sure you're right,

805
00:57:24,192 --> 00:57:26,235
if you're thinking they're
headed for the castle.

806
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,780
Yeah, that's right,
the castle-

807
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,156
the Castle of Chaythe.

808
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:32,492
What are you thinking?
We can't go in there!

809
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:34,994
It would be suicide!
It would be insane!

810
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:37,705
What are you now,
afraid of a little insanity?

811
00:57:37,705 --> 00:57:39,332
Since when
have we been sane?

812
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:42,168
We just have to get to them
before they reach the castle.

813
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,380
There's a bridge up ahead.

814
00:57:45,964 --> 00:57:48,174
That's where we
intercept the carriage.

815
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:49,842
I remember that trick

816
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:52,261
from the time we got
those vampires at Keldo.

817
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:55,515
Yeah. It worked that time,
and it can work again now.

818
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:58,476
Leila, come in.
Come in, Leila. Over.

819
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:00,228
Yeah, it's me.
l copy.

820
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:01,437
What's up?

821
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:03,022
I'm on my way.

822
00:58:30,842 --> 00:58:31,509
Uhh!

823
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:39,267
Don't move.
I'm warning you!

824
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:40,643
Try anything funny,

825
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,895
and you'll be blown
to smithereens.

826
00:58:44,272 --> 00:58:45,398
You want to try it?

827
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:47,650
I didn't think so.

828
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:50,945
We just want the girl.

829
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:00,955
Hello there!

830
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:02,832
She's still human!

831
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:06,335
Come on,
get out of there! Now!

832
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,048
Borgoff,
she won't come!

833
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:13,092
We're doing you a favor!

834
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,639
Come on!

835
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,475
I said
get out of there!

836
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:21,059
Uhh!

837
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,905
Let that be a lesson to you,
you cowardly Barbarois animal!

838
00:59:34,072 --> 00:59:34,989
Borgoff, look!

839
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:36,365
Borgoff!

840
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:36,824
What?

841
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:38,618
What the...

842
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:51,297
What, is this guy crazy?

843
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:52,882
Doesn't he know
he can't exist

844
00:59:52,882 --> 00:59:54,383
outside here
in the sunlight?

845
00:59:56,344 --> 00:59:58,930
I won't let you take her!

846
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,264
Oh, yeah?

847
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:03,518
Uhh!

848
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:05,770
Thanks a lot.

849
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,355
You're making our
job a lot easier.

850
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:08,689
Hot enough for you?

851
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:10,024
It's what
you deserve!

852
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:12,193
Uhh!

853
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:25,331
Over here,
hot stuff.

854
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:29,585
Hoo hoo!
Look at him burn!

855
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:34,966
Here, a little something
No!

856
01:00:36,217 --> 01:00:37,051
How does that feel?

857
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:38,511
Way to go,
moron.

858
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:40,555
That got him!

859
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:41,848
What's the
matter? Don't you-

860
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:45,434
Look at him!

861
01:00:46,102 --> 01:00:47,478
Hey, where
do you think-

862
01:00:47,854 --> 01:00:48,855
Why'd you let her go?

863
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:01,784
I love you.

864
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:14,547
Uhh!

865
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:22,513
I can't go on without you.

866
01:01:27,894 --> 01:01:28,603
What?!

867
01:01:34,817 --> 01:01:37,403
Borgoff, we should just
let her kill herself,

868
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:39,238
and then we can
finish him off.

869
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:40,406
What do you think
about that idea?

870
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:42,450
We get the money
if she's dead or alive.

871
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,951
Hey,
you're right! OK.

872
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:52,627
Stop it!

873
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:53,878
Uhh!

874
01:01:58,216 --> 01:01:58,925
Kyle!

875
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:01,969
I'll blow you to hell!

876
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,264
Aah!

877
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,224
What?!

878
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:11,437
No!

879
01:02:36,337 --> 01:02:38,923
I don't want you to worry
about these wounds of mine.

880
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:41,717
They will heal.

881
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:45,137
Then we shall go to the City
of Night in Distant Stars.

882
01:02:46,097 --> 01:02:47,139
When we go there,

883
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:49,558
we can be alone and
free to love each other.

884
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,813
It's true. Believe me.

885
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:56,732
We'll be there soon.

886
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:42,903
We're it now.

887
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:45,740
We're the only ones left,
Borgoff.

888
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,283
We should just give it up.

889
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:52,204
If we make it
into that castle,

890
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:54,040
none of us will
make it out alive.

891
01:03:54,332 --> 01:03:55,875
We can't quit now.

892
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,962
We owe it to Kyle and
to Nolt to keep going on.

893
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,966
Listen, Borgoff-

894
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:05,676
Shut up!
I won't hear it!

895
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:12,808
Leila,
what do you think?

896
01:04:13,476 --> 01:04:15,102
Grove, they fear us.

897
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:18,064
They fear us because
they know our reputation,

898
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:21,609
that we never give up
and we never can.

899
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:24,737
If we quit now, we might
as well quit the business,

900
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:25,821
and I can't do that.

901
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:29,325
I won't do it, till every
last one of them is gone.

902
01:04:49,095 --> 01:04:51,972
Master, do you hear?

903
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:54,225
He's coming.

904
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,102
The castle is nearby.

905
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:57,937
I'll stay here
and deal with him.

906
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:26,340
We're getting close.
The Castle of Chaythe.

907
01:05:26,841 --> 01:05:28,342
Soon we'll be
able to see it.

908
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:32,096
The home of Carmila,
the Bloody Countess.

909
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:33,556
You've heard of her.

910
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:36,851
For 5,000 years,
her rule of terror lasted,

911
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:38,477
and then that was that.

912
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:47,111
Your father,
the Vampire King, grew angry.

913
01:05:47,486 --> 01:05:49,488
He was impatient
with her vanity,

914
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:52,658
offended by her bloodlust,
her gluttony.

915
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:54,577
He grew so tired

916
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:56,662
that he killed her
while she slept,

917
01:05:56,662 --> 01:05:59,915
impaling her on his sword,
and that was it for her.

918
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:03,419
Except
she haunts the place now

919
01:06:03,419 --> 01:06:04,753
with phantoms and demons,

920
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:06,839
but you don't care
about that, do you?

921
01:06:07,548 --> 01:06:10,718
But I bet I know what really
gets to you, dunpeal, eh?

922
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:12,845
What really gets to you.

923
01:06:13,262 --> 01:06:16,223
The thought of those
two lovebirds giving birth

924
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:19,018
to another dunpeal, huh?
That's it, isn't it?

925
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:21,979
See? I know you.
I know how you think.

926
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:23,564
I know how you feel.

927
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:26,358
I know every move
that you make.

928
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:27,818
You can't -uhh!

929
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:40,766
I'm glad we could
meet at last, hunter D.

930
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,893
You are a worthy opponent.

931
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:46,397
Who hired
the Barbarois?

932
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:48,607
Who were you
working for?

933
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:52,987
Uhh! It was Carmila
who hired us,

934
01:07:52,987 --> 01:07:55,990
and as a Barbarois,
my duty has been fulfilled.

935
01:07:56,198 --> 01:07:58,242
Now I can die in peace.

936
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,251
I gather
from your letter

937
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:09,128
that you've had
a rather difficult time.

938
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:11,505
I think I can understand
what it's like.

939
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:13,632
Love is not unique
to humans, you know.

940
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:15,968
We vampires
are very susceptible.

941
01:08:16,552 --> 01:08:18,053
I hope I can be of service.

942
01:08:18,596 --> 01:08:20,264
We're very grateful,
Carmila.

943
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,937
You both
must be exhausted.

944
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:28,647
Perhaps you
should rest first.

945
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:30,190
I'm sure
that the young lady

946
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,358
would like
to freshen up.

947
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:35,362
Hmm.

948
01:08:40,743 --> 01:08:42,661
You've probably
heard rumors about me,

949
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:44,121
but I can assure you

950
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:46,582
they all stem
from jealousy and envy.

951
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:49,835
I'm not the "Bloody Carmila"
they like to portray me as.

952
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:51,920
Now, behold.

953
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:03,432
That's it.
That is the ship.

954
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:06,894
It will take you
to the City of the Night,

955
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:09,313
where you can
live peacefully at last.

956
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,690
You can be happy there.

957
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:15,235
There was a time,
many years ago,

958
01:09:15,653 --> 01:09:17,655
when every castle
had a ship like this one

959
01:09:17,905 --> 01:09:20,908
and the night sky was full
of their flashing lights.

960
01:09:22,451 --> 01:09:24,787
Those were the days
when vampires flourished

961
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:27,873
and a love like yours was not
so desperately impossible.

962
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:30,793
So different from today.

963
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:35,047
Our numbers dwindling,
hunted and alone,

964
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:37,216
we are hopelessly
misunderstood,

965
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:42,513
but you two seem
to have beaten the odds.

966
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:46,725
I'm very, very happy for you.

967
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:52,690
The ship hasn't
been used in years.

968
01:09:53,315 --> 01:09:55,359
I've no idea
if it will fly safely,

969
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:56,485
but I'm sure
that's a risk

970
01:09:56,485 --> 01:09:57,736
you're prepared to take.

971
01:09:59,905 --> 01:10:01,240
We're very grateful.

972
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:04,451
I only wish
I could go with you.

973
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:13,210
You look so beautiful.

974
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:44,575
Mmm.

975
01:10:44,992 --> 01:10:45,909
Why stop?

976
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:48,746
I want you, Meier.
I want all of you.

977
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:54,042
Why not?

978
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:57,629
You don't know what
it's like, Charlotte,

979
01:10:57,838 --> 01:11:01,258
to live forever
in darkness eternal,

980
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:03,635
forever
thirsting for blood

981
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:06,096
despite
your best intention.

982
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:08,766
I can't imagine
that life for you.

983
01:11:08,766 --> 01:11:10,142
Not for you, Charlotte.

984
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:12,352
You're so selfish, Meier.

985
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:17,566
I carry a heavy weight
on my conscience...

986
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,028
Those villagers
and the bounty hunter

987
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:21,987
and my family,

988
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:24,198
they still mourn my loss, Meier.

989
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:26,992
It wasn't
your doing, Charlotte.

990
01:11:27,534 --> 01:11:29,495
It was my fault
entirely.

991
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:32,247
Well,
then we're both to blame,

992
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:33,832
because
we can't know happiness,

993
01:11:33,832 --> 01:11:34,917
not anymore.

994
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,127
I wanted you
to be happy, Meier,

995
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:40,130
and so I abandoned my father
and my brother for you.

996
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:43,383
But their pain set the wheels
in motion for our pain,

997
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:45,302
and so on and on it goes.

998
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:50,057
All we have
is each other now,

999
01:11:50,057 --> 01:11:51,725
and I want to be
close to you.

1000
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:54,394
Without that,
we have nothing.

1001
01:11:59,024 --> 01:12:01,610
All the pain I've caused
and all the agony I feel

1002
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:02,611
is nothing now.

1003
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:05,531
And you are everything
to me, my love.

1004
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:18,085
We'll talk more on
our trip to the stars,

1005
01:12:18,085 --> 01:12:19,545
if that's all right
with you.

1006
01:12:23,674 --> 01:12:25,676
There is some
unfinished business

1007
01:12:25,676 --> 01:12:26,927
I have to attend to.

1008
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,639
Do not leave this room.
Understand?

1009
01:13:09,553 --> 01:13:10,137
D-

1010
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:23,191
Listen, Meier.

1011
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:25,444
The woman says she
wants to go back home.

1012
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:36,914
I don't believe it.

1013
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:00,938
Charlotte.

1014
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:16,745
I don't know.
Something's not right.

1015
01:14:17,788 --> 01:14:21,041
Of course, you don't
have to take my word for it.

1016
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:24,795
You can judge for yourself.

1017
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:57,369
Let's go.

1018
01:15:00,247 --> 01:15:01,164
Leila.

1019
01:15:01,373 --> 01:15:02,165
Don't go.

1020
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:05,335
Leila,
don't go in there.

1021
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:06,712
If you go in there,

1022
01:15:06,712 --> 01:15:08,130
you're never
coming back.

1023
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,424
Oh,
I'm coming back.

1024
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:13,051
No!

1025
01:15:31,111 --> 01:15:32,738
Borgoff, on headset:
Leila, check upstairs.

1026
01:15:32,738 --> 01:15:33,613
I'm on it.

1027
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:41,621
Nice hat.

1028
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:30,504
I know you hate me, D.

1029
01:16:31,088 --> 01:16:33,215
Please try and understand.

1030
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:35,467
I loved your father.

1031
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:37,844
What choice did I have?

1032
01:16:40,806 --> 01:16:41,640
Huh?!

1033
01:16:53,735 --> 01:16:54,277
Ahh!

1034
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:05,163
Nolt! Kyle! Hey!

1035
01:17:05,747 --> 01:17:06,873
I don't believe it.

1036
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:10,043
You two sure are
a sight for sore eyes.

1037
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:13,338
Ugh!

1038
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:39,531
What are
you doing? Get up.

1039
01:17:40,866 --> 01:17:41,908
Why aren't you
listening?

1040
01:17:42,242 --> 01:17:43,243
I said get up.

1041
01:17:45,537 --> 01:17:49,499
Go away. I wanna be alone.

1042
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:53,253
Get out of here!

1043
01:18:03,972 --> 01:18:05,599
Can you
forgive me, D?

1044
01:18:07,309 --> 01:18:07,809
D?

1045
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:10,937
I know it's been
lonely for you.

1046
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:13,773
I was lonely, too,

1047
01:18:14,566 --> 01:18:16,359
until you came along.

1048
01:18:17,152 --> 01:18:18,820
Did you hear, D?

1049
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:30,665
It's OK, honey.

1050
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,417
It's OK to cry.

1051
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:35,045
I know.
I know how you feel.

1052
01:18:36,922 --> 01:18:38,590
It wasn't
your fault.

1053
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:39,591
It wasn't.

1054
01:18:40,592 --> 01:18:41,843
Yes, it was!

1055
01:18:42,928 --> 01:18:43,970
<i>Let go!</i>

1056
01:18:46,932 --> 01:18:47,557
Wait!

1057
01:18:48,225 --> 01:18:48,767
Ugh.

1058
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:56,900
It's just an illusion.

1059
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,069
Carmila's playing with us.

1060
01:19:01,988 --> 01:19:03,823
Excellent. What fun.

1061
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:07,786
I haven't had
this much fun in centuries.

1062
01:19:07,786 --> 01:19:09,287
You don't mind, do you?

1063
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:12,082
It just makes things
so much more interesting.

1064
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:14,834
You're doing very well,
by the way,

1065
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:16,378
very well, indeed.

1066
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:19,172
The woman. Where
are you hiding her?

1067
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:32,394
Borgoff,
what are you doing?

1068
01:19:32,394 --> 01:19:33,895
We don't have time for this.

1069
01:19:34,354 --> 01:19:37,190
Leila, are you in love
with this dunpeal?

1070
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:38,108
Are you crazy?

1071
01:19:38,108 --> 01:19:39,401
What is wrong
with you?

1072
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:42,946
Borgoff!

1073
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:51,538
Dunpeal, drop your weapon.

1074
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:04,676
Drop it now! Grrr!

1075
01:20:04,676 --> 01:20:06,177
She took you in,
didn't she?

1076
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:10,265
Grr! She'll die!

1077
01:20:10,515 --> 01:20:12,100
I'm warning you, dunpeal.

1078
01:20:12,267 --> 01:20:13,768
Don't come any closer.

1079
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:18,898
Enough!
Now you die!

1080
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:20,108
Aaah!

1081
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:23,945
No!

1082
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,366
Aaaah!

1083
01:20:28,366 --> 01:20:29,159
Grove!

1084
01:20:29,576 --> 01:20:31,411
Grove! No!

1085
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:38,043
Lei... la...

1086
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:42,440
Look!
She's coming!

1087
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:43,858
Carmila!

1088
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:51,032
The spirit of Carmila!

1089
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:28,153
Dunpeal hunter.

1090
01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:31,781
Your mother was human,
but your father was a vampire,

1091
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:34,033
and you have betrayed
his ancient blood!

1092
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:37,036
You side with humans
against us!

1093
01:22:40,165 --> 01:22:42,500
Our people
are facing extinction,

1094
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:45,170
and you're contributing
to their demise.

1095
01:22:45,587 --> 01:22:49,632
You stalk and kill
your own ancestors, dunpeal.

1096
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:55,096
You should be ashamed!

1097
01:22:56,306 --> 01:22:58,808
Your human self
is your weaker self.

1098
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:00,810
Humans are nothing more
than livestock.

1099
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:03,021
We prey on them
as they prey on beasts.

1100
01:23:03,021 --> 01:23:04,939
This is the rule of nature!

1101
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:20,413
Your time
is coming to an end.

1102
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:22,999
Your kind
must face extinction.

1103
01:23:22,999 --> 01:23:26,085
You cannot survive.
You must die.

1104
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:28,087
That is the rule
of nature.

1105
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:31,883
Ah. Very strong words
for a dunpeal,

1106
01:23:32,217 --> 01:23:33,760
but you seem to forget

1107
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:37,597
our spirits are eternal.

1108
01:23:38,139 --> 01:23:39,724
No, Carmila.

1109
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,726
Nothing lasts forever.

1110
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:45,104
I see.

1111
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:47,190
I should have
known better

1112
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,399
than to reason
with your kind,

1113
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:49,609
dunpeal hunter.

1114
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:52,987
I guess my only option
is to use force.

1115
01:23:53,238 --> 01:23:54,822
Aaaah!

1116
01:24:26,604 --> 01:24:28,606
Aaah!

1117
01:24:31,568 --> 01:24:33,111
No!
This can't happen!

1118
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:47,375
Aaaah!

1119
01:24:50,295 --> 01:24:54,424
Aaaah!

1120
01:24:58,177 --> 01:25:01,222
Are you the son
of the Vampire King?

1121
01:25:01,222 --> 01:25:02,515
Who are you?

1122
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:04,392
Who are you,
dunpeal?

1123
01:25:09,147 --> 01:25:10,857
Such power.

1124
01:25:40,428 --> 01:25:41,888
Charlotte,
come back.

1125
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:43,890
I need you.
Please come back.

1126
01:25:48,978 --> 01:25:51,105
Mmm. Ohh.

1127
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:55,735
Darling, is that you?

1128
01:25:56,361 --> 01:25:58,613
Oh, yes.
It's me, Meier.

1129
01:25:59,405 --> 01:26:00,740
I'm so happy, Meier,

1130
01:26:01,324 --> 01:26:04,619
because we are together now,
at last.

1131
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:06,954
Together at last.

1132
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:10,958
You made me happy,
Meier.

1133
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:12,752
You let me dream.

1134
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:15,546
You let me dream of
our beautiful trip

1135
01:26:15,546 --> 01:26:16,673
to the stars.

1136
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:17,799
Our dream.

1137
01:26:18,675 --> 01:26:21,636
Our beautiful,
wonderful dream.

1138
01:26:21,928 --> 01:26:23,012
It's not a dream.

1139
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:25,807
We are going to those stars,
Charlotte.

1140
01:26:26,349 --> 01:26:28,142
Oh, my dear one.

1141
01:26:30,103 --> 01:26:31,979
You and I will
get away from here.

1142
01:26:32,397 --> 01:26:34,816
We will fly together
to the City of the Night

1143
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:37,527
where we were meant to be
free from all of this.

1144
01:26:37,527 --> 01:26:40,321
Where you can rest,
my love, finally, and be free.

1145
01:26:40,822 --> 01:26:41,698
Yes.

1146
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:45,368
Freedom... at last.

1147
01:26:58,548 --> 01:27:01,884
My precious,
precious love.

1148
01:27:07,974 --> 01:27:08,808
Let's go...

1149
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:10,935
Away from here.

1150
01:27:19,986 --> 01:27:21,571
Stop right there,
Meier.

1151
01:27:23,448 --> 01:27:24,949
I'm taking her back,

1152
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:27,118
back to her family,
who loved her.

1153
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:36,252
She knew I loved her
best of all.

1154
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:38,880
You can't understand it.

1155
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,923
You've never
loved a human.

1156
01:27:41,299 --> 01:27:43,092
I've never
killed one, either.

1157
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:47,597
You struggle to resist
this nature of ours,

1158
01:27:47,597 --> 01:27:49,724
but it can't last
forever, D.

1159
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,019
The urge for their blood
is stronger.

1160
01:27:53,603 --> 01:27:56,272
If that day comes,
then another will hunt me.

1161
01:27:56,481 --> 01:27:58,024
It's as simple as that.

1162
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:02,403
Raaaahhh!

1163
01:28:32,892 --> 01:28:35,520
What a waste,
a sad waste.

1164
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:10,555
Enough of killing.

1165
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:13,307
Enough of misery and death.

1166
01:29:14,976 --> 01:29:16,477
I've had enough.

1167
01:29:36,873 --> 01:29:38,708
I've had enough.

1168
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:40,459
Uhh!

1169
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:06,360
Why...

1170
01:30:07,695 --> 01:30:08,654
did you miss

1171
01:30:10,156 --> 01:30:11,699
my heart?

1172
01:30:26,047 --> 01:30:26,923
She's dead.

1173
01:30:27,548 --> 01:30:29,383
The ring is all I need.

1174
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:33,554
I'll take it
to her father as proof.

1175
01:31:47,461 --> 01:31:50,339
Mind giving me a ride
just as far as the next town?

1176
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:51,924
I'd appreciate it.

1177
01:31:56,721 --> 01:31:59,223
That reward money would
rightfully be mine, you know.

1178
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:01,267
But, hey, I'm generous.

1179
01:32:01,976 --> 01:32:04,145
I'll let you keep it
just this one time.

1180
01:32:38,679 --> 01:32:40,139
Where is he taking her?

1181
01:32:44,685 --> 01:32:45,770
Away from here.

1182
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,481
Away.

1183
01:32:56,113 --> 01:32:57,823
Fly. Come on!

1184
01:33:04,789 --> 01:33:05,956
You can make it.

1185
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:08,667
Come on!

1186
01:33:13,339 --> 01:33:14,340
Fly away-

1187
01:34:07,476 --> 01:34:08,352
Dearly beloved,

1188
01:34:08,352 --> 01:34:10,521
we are gathered here
in this resting place

1189
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:12,439
to bid farewell
to our sister.

1190
01:34:13,524 --> 01:34:14,692
Into your gentle arms

1191
01:34:14,692 --> 01:34:16,277
we commend
her gracious spirit.

1192
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:22,408
Take her to yourself
and give her safe haven,

1193
01:34:23,409 --> 01:34:25,077
and though
she struggled in life,

1194
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:28,038
now she knows
your blessed peace.

1195
01:34:29,123 --> 01:34:31,709
For all who question
will find answers,

1196
01:34:32,293 --> 01:34:33,419
and all who love

1197
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:38,340
will find contentment,
joy, and peace eternal.

1198
01:34:39,425 --> 01:34:42,178
For now we see
as through a glass darkly,

1199
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:46,515
but then we shall see
clearly, face to face.

1200
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:53,480
Mister.

1201
01:34:54,607 --> 01:34:55,232
Wait!

1202
01:34:56,942 --> 01:34:58,194
Mister, wait!

1203
01:34:58,652 --> 01:35:01,697
Um, excuse me, sir,

1204
01:35:01,697 --> 01:35:03,532
but I was wondering

1205
01:35:03,532 --> 01:35:05,284
if you knew
my grandmother Leila.

1206
01:35:10,748 --> 01:35:13,042
Yes, it's you, isn't it?

1207
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:15,377
My grandmother
told me about you.

1208
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:16,962
So, I'd be honored

1209
01:35:16,962 --> 01:35:18,255
if you'd come
to our house.

1210
01:35:18,255 --> 01:35:20,049
My dad
would be so happy.

1211
01:35:20,674 --> 01:35:21,383
Please?

1212
01:35:23,177 --> 01:35:25,054
I appreciate your kindness.

1213
01:35:25,387 --> 01:35:28,140
Oh, come on.
We don't live very far.

1214
01:35:32,269 --> 01:35:34,063
I just came here
to keep a promise

1215
01:35:34,063 --> 01:35:35,814
to an old friend of mine.

1216
01:35:37,524 --> 01:35:40,527
She was afraid no one
would mourn her death.

1217
01:35:40,819 --> 01:35:42,571
I'm glad she was so wrong.

1218
01:35:42,947 --> 01:35:43,530
Huh?

1219
01:35:43,948 --> 01:35:46,116
Oh. I guess I see.

1220
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:52,957
Anyway, thank you
for coming, sir.

1221
01:36:03,384 --> 01:36:04,260
Good-bye.

1222
01:36:07,012 --> 01:36:07,763
Good-bye!

1223
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:13,560
Well, that was nice.

1224
01:36:14,144 --> 01:36:16,230
You're not so bad
after all.

1225
01:36:17,898 --> 01:36:19,566
You just dress bad.

1226
01:36:37,876 --> 01:36:47,876
