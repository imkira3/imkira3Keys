<i>(boy) Sharkboy was not always
half shark, half boy.</i>

3
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:18,176
<i>He was a marine biologist -
or, at least, in training.</i>

4
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,735
<i>His father studied great white sharks</i>

5
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:26,252
<i>and called his son "Sharkboy" because of
how much he loved to care for the sharks.</i>

6
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,153
<i>He made them sushi
and had given them all names.:</i>

7
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,954
<i>Goodmilk, Peggy, Eggbat...</i>

8
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,786
<i>and Crackett.</i>

9
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,269
<i>But one day
an incredible, mysterious storm appeared.</i>

10
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,239
<i>It swept away the entire laboratory.</i>

11
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,434
Sharkboy!

12
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,570
<i>Thanks to their life rafts,
Sharkboy and his father survived.</i>

13
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,547
<i>But they survived
on different sides of the wreckage,</i>

14
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,880
<i>each floating off in a different direction.</i>

15
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,283
Sharkboy!

16
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,652
<i>Sharkboy was completely alone.</i>

17
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,483
<i>Almost completely.</i>

18
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,462
<i>But one of the sharks recognized him.</i>

19
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,329
Hey, it's Sharkboy,

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,097
Don't take a bite outta him, boys -
he's a friend,

21
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:24,710
<i>They took Sharkboy to their cave home,
where he'd be safe and dry.</i>

22
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,714
<i>His new family were sharks.</i>

23
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,521
<i>Hundreds of sharks.</i>

24
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,124
<i>The sharks raised him
as one of their own,</i>

25
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,030
<i>training him in the ways of the shark.</i>

26
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,762
You must keep moving to survive,

27
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,669
Always go forward, never back,

28
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,234
<i>To live by instinct and instinct alone.</i>

29
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:06,183
<i>Eventually he grew gills,
and sharp talons for claws.</i>

30
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,914
<i>His teeth sharpened themselves
to a point.</i>

31
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:14,016
<i>He grew fins - all sorts of fins.</i>

32
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,288
<i>But that was years ago.</i>

33
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,958
<i>I first met Sharkboy
while fishing on the dock this summer.</i>

34
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,677
<i>He seemed lost.</i>

35
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,476
- You have to get a job!
- No, l have a job!

36
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,518
<i>So I snuck him home...</i>

37
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,850
Then maybe you should just leave,

38
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,913
<i>...when my parents
were too busy to notice.</i>

39
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,458
<i>I kept him fed and in water.</i>

40
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:55,791
<i>He had been traveling the universe
in search of his father.</i>

41
00:03:55,868 --> 00:04:02,068
<i>He told me of his latest adventures
on a planet so cool it makes you drool.</i>

42
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,873
<i>He said I too
could go to Planet Drool someday.</i>

43
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,943
<i>Then one night
I was visited by a glowing light.</i>

44
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:17,581
<i>An amazing girl with purple flames for hair
and skin of molten lava rock appeared.</i>

45
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,147
<i>I called her...</i>

46
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,193
Lavagirl,

47
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,788
<i>She smiled at me,
for that seemed to be her name.</i>

48
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:28,960
<i>She told me she needed Sharkboy
to return to Planet Drool with her,</i>

49
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,663
<i>for a great crisis was developing.</i>

50
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:37,005
<i>She asked if I could go with them.
I told her, "I have school tomorrow . "</i>

51
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,876
<i>She gave me a sad look
and flamed away,</i>

52
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,415
<i>taking Sharkboy with her.</i>

53
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,780
<i>I haven't seen Sharkboy
or Lavagirl since then.</i>

54
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,448
And that's what l did this summer,

55
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,323
<i>(laughter)</i>

56
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,092
<i>(teacher) Enough!</i>

57
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:03,965
Someone is picking that up,
And it's not gonna be me!

58
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,429
We were supposed to tell true stories,

59
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,476
<i>That is a true story,</i>

60
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:15,537
- Does Lavagirl have special powers?
- There's no such thing as Lavagirl,

61
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,245
<i>She can,,,</i>

62
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,751
She can shoot lava out of her hands,

63
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,085
Cool,

64
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,888
How many people think
Max's story is true?

65
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,655
- Not true,
- Made up,

66
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,597
- Not true,
- lt's just a made-up story,

67
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,894
lf it's true, why don't you bring
Sharkboy and Lavagirl to class tomorrow?

68
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,565
They went away,
l don't know where they went,

69
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,131
Have a seat, Max,

70
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,541
Linus, you're next,

71
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,207
<i>(laughter)</i>

72
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:57,146
<i>This summer, l met a new friend,,,
who was half dork, half boy,</i>

73
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,384
l called him Dorkboy,

74
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,089
But his real name was Max,

75
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:07,997
We had him for dinner, but he stunk
so bad that we all blew chunks,

76
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,231
<i>- That's enough, Linus,
- (school bell)</i>

77
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,763
Linus, Max, stay,

78
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,537
Come on, Mr, E!

79
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,805
Class, what's my name?

80
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,076
Mr, Electricidad,

81
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,743
Mr, Electricidad, exactly,

82
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:30,949
Not Mr, Electric,
not Mr, Electrici-tha-tha-tha-tha,

83
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:36,459
Linus, you just earned a minus
for your behavior today,

84
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,761
This is a new year,
Do you think you can be friends?

85
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,095
<i>(both) No,</i>

86
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,262
Then it's been decided:
you'll be the best of friends,

87
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,206
Which means
no more picking on Max, Linus,

88
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,237
Max,

89
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:56,077
You're in the fourth grade,
There are some good kids in this class,

90
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,585
Find them, Make friends with them,

91
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:04,589
Dreaming keeps you from seeing
what's right here in front of you,

92
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:08,855
This isn't a dream,
This is the real world,

93
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,828
Lost my train of thought,

94
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,062
No dreaming, Got it,

95
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,001
l'll try harder,

96
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,232
What do you have there?

97
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,975
lt's my dream journal,

98
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,208
lt has all of my most precious dreams in it,

99
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,911
l'll never part with it
for as long as l live,

100
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,486
You're a good kid, Max,

101
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,864
Max!

102
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,958
<i>Let's be imaginary friends,</i>

103
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:53,495
<i>You can try and hang with us,,,
and we'll pretend you don't exist!</i>

104
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,201
Check it out,
Sharkboy gets shocked by electric eels,

105
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,405
and then they feed on his cooked flesh,

106
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,346
Wow, Linus,

107
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,783
<i>Your skills are,,, weak,</i>

108
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,049
<i>Ohh,,,</i>

109
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,329
l'm gonna burst your bubble, Dream Boy,

110
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,035
You're dead!

111
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,231
Get the book!

112
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,418
Give me the book,

113
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,479
Hand over the book,
or you'll visit the dream world!

114
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,607
<i>Ooh,,,</i>

00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,940

My cookies! My giant cookies!

130
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:39,494
What are you doing baking sweets? You
know what happens when he eats sugar,

131
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,631
l baked them for his class,

132
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,108
So you could make friends at school,
and now you've eaten all of them,

133
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,042
No, it was Sharkboy and Lavagirl!

134
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:51,675
Look - this one has shark bites,
and this one is singed,

<i>(mother) There's no such thing

Your mother's right, When you go to sleep

<i>But when you open 'em again, Sharkgirl

141
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,373
You can wait till you're in bed
to close your eyes, Max,

142
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,682
Kids need their dreams,

There are plenty of good opportunities,
You just need to look,

Ooh, traffic engineer!

159

Hey,

l was cleaning out my closet
and look what l found,

161
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,449
Remember Tobor?
The robot you tried to build?

162
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,155
Why were you cleaning out your closet?

163
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,459
l had to find one of these,

164

- Max, l'm walking you to school today,

So what do you say?
Wanna finish making Tobor?

167

lt won't work,

168
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,046
- Well, how do you know?
- 'Cause you told me it wouldn't,

169
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,177
l did?

170
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:48,683
l'm sorry,
l should've never said that,

171
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,389
lt's OK, You were right,

172
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,958
Dumb idea,

173
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,264
How did these happen?

174
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,807
The grass was dead anyway,

175
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,173
Why are you so morbid?

176
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,840
l just wish anything could happen
so l wouldn't have to go to school today,

177
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,315
That's not realistic, Max,

178
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:16,514
lt's bad enough your father's head
is in the clouds, but not you too, OK?

179
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,252
Just push that dream aside and move on,

180
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:25,559
Like with your dream?
The one about you and Dad and me?

181
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,758
Well, l do have a dream about us,

school's waiting,

186
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,747
Did we have to move so close to school?

187
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,719
Your father thought
we'd save money on gas,

188
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:54,191
Come right home after school today, 'cause
there's some things we need to talk about,

189

l love you,

Well, when cold air mixes with hot air,

00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,732
- Mostly trapped on Mount Neverrest,
- By Mr, Electric,

312
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,642
But Planet Drool's a place for kids
to dream and have endless fun!

313
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:11,111
<i>lt's endless fun, all right,

<i>,,,you can't get off,</i>

316
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,718
Kids aren't allowed to rest,
'cause if they rest, they sleep,

317
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,919
and if they sleep, they dream,

318
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:26,259
<i>- And if they dream,,,
- lt takes power away from Mr, Electric,</i>

319
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,993
But we're gonna stop him
with our secret weapon,

320
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,161
Shouldn't we save those kids first?

00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,053
Who knows where Mr, Electric is hiding?

00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,692
Everyone?

They're not raising their hands,
You're all upside down,

<i>- Let's get outta here!
- Everyone back in your seats!</i>

Who's Mr, Electric?

333
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:59,884
He's supposed to provide light to the
planet, but all he brings now is darkness,

334
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,051
<i>Fun has begun!</i>

00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:31,085
My home! At half its normal power,

Well, well, well,
lf it isn't Sharkboy and Lavagirl,

344
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:26,401
What are you doing halting my endless-fun
coaster and infiltrating my lair?

345
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,605
We don't need permission from you,

346
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,238
Fiery!

l don't believe we've met,
l'm Mr, Electric!

348

Why are you bringing misery to our planet?
You're supposed to be running it,

349
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:44,324
<i>(mimics) You're supposed to be running it,

- Those are my orders,
- Who ordered that?

351
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:52,162
No school, no discipline, no rules,
And, most important, no dreams,

352
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,296
Dreams can destroy you, can't they?

353
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,535
- My instincts tell me that is so,
- Really?

354
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:03,047
- That's why we have to stop you,
- You and what army?

355
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,080

But is it enough to defeat Mr, Electric?

363
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:52,419
We have our secret weapon, remember?

364
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:57,593
Did you really believe you could stop me?

365

- Show him what you're made of, Max,
- What am l supposed to do?

369
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,570
- l told you this would happen,
- l thought he would just remember,

370
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,980
Remember what?!

371
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,951
The dream, Remember the dream,

That's why l write them

Well, at least we're on
the Passage of Time,

383
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,866
Maybe it'll take us to the Dream Lair,

What's in the Dream Lair?

386
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,834
lt's where all the dreams

But they're being destroyed,

- How?
- That's what we have to find out,

389

Soon even Sharkboy and l

Great thinking, Sharkie!

394
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:43,497
We can read his dreams out loud
and turn everything back to the way it was,

395
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,469
l may even realize my true identity,

l threw it away,

We really thought
you were the answer, Max,

Don't listen to him, He's just upset
because you didn't show up

400
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,786
and make him king of the ocean,
with a giant fish army to back him up,

Look who's talking!

402

You thought you'd find a great use
for your powers and heal the planet,

Ohh!

lt was Sharkboy and Lavagirl,
But l took care of it - see?

Someone was with them?

414
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,200
Just another child afraid of
his own shadow, No threat to us,

415
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,907
l banished him to the Dream Graveyard,

416
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,543
Where old dreams lie?
He could find an ally!

l told you, every dream must be smashed,
every child captured!

You want him back,
we'll simply track him when he falls asleep,

Fool! He's the Daydreamer,

And the moment he realizes it
will be the moment of our doom!

421
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,529
Now what do you want me to do?

422
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,698
Bring me the boy
before he discovers his true powers

00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,257
Yep?

467
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,389
- lt's Tobor!
- Who?

468
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,663
Tobor! l dreamt him up when l was a kid -

469
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,762
a robot that could help me
with my homework,

470
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:19,799
l tried to build him once, Everyone
kept telling me he would never work,

471
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:23,938
So here he is - a forgotten dream
in the Dream Graveyard,

472
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,711
Maybe he can help us,

473
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,252
He's supposed to be very smart,

474
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,515
Tobor, awake!

475
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,018
Yes?

476
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,718
He works!

477
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,956
- We can ask him anything now,
- Let me, let me!

478
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,363
Tell me something about me,
l'm clueless,

479
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:46,995
Actually, you are extremely bright,

480
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,136
Am l king of the ocean, or what?

481
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,403
No, Sorry,

482
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,911
How do l save Planet Drool?

483
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,210
The answer is in your dreams,

484
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,845
You mean if l put him to sleep,
he'll dream us out of this mess?

485
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,654
No, At least, not here,

486
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:13,163
Darkness is falling, Any dream of his
would become a nightmare -

487
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,496
and you don't want those
becoming a reality,

488
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,025
<i>But if you go
to the Land of Milk and Cookies,,,</i>

489
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,264
Of course!

490
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,899
<i>,,,that's where the good dreams are,</i>

491
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,535
Where the answers are,

492
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,135
lt's perfect, Max,

493
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,579
The Land of Milk and Cookies
is a safe, sweet place,

494
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,947
You'll be able to dream easily there,

495
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,610
Can you take us?

496
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:39,281
l have no body, l can't move,

497
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,918
You can move your eyes and your mouth,

498
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:46,392
Why didn't you work back on Earth, Tobor?

499
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:51,902
Some dreams are so powerful they
become real - like Sharkboy and Lavagirl,

500
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:56,906
l, on the other hand,
am still only a dream,

501
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:57,963

503
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,139
You were taking us to the Land
of Milk and Cookies, remember?

504
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:09,949
l mean l'm literally losing

<i>(Max) That's the Train of Thought?
How do l keep it on track?</i>

506
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:18,420
With your mind, The Train of Thought
gets easily distracted,

507
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:23,695
Stay focused, and it'll speed you directly
to the Land of Milk and Cookies,

508
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,736
The rest is up to you,

Sorry l forgot about you, Tobor,

510
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,098
Are you kidding? You just saved me,

511
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,735

- We can't control it,

515
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,689
All you have to do is keep it on track,

516
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,594
How can you keep it on track

l really didn't think about it,

00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,592
No, look!

626
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,000
lt's a banana-split boat!

627
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:20,934
<i>(rumbling)</i>

628
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,199
Then let's split!

629
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,607
Ow!

630
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,973
Huh?

631
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,520
<i>(exasperated wail)</i>

632
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:50,826
Catch you later,

633
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:56,162
All dreamers must dream,

634
00:47:56,974 --> 00:48:00,603
This is great, Max,
You're starting to daydream,

635
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,976
Keep that up, and they'll never get us,

636
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,175
Why not?

637
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:11,153
Learn to dream with your eyes open,
and you won't have to be asleep to dream,

638
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:15,419
You'll be able to make anything happen
at any time,

639
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:23,797
# Row, row, row your banana-split boat
gently down the Stream of Consciousness

640
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,267
# Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

641
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,964
# Life is Max's dream

642
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,901
Sugar will give you nightmares,

643
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:36,241
- How much time do we have?
- Don't ask,

644
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:42,475
The Dream Lair's across the Ocean of lce,
We'll have to travel there by foot,

645
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:45,487
What was it you saw in your dream, Max?

646
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:50,021
<i>l saw an object shaped like,,,</i>

647
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,429
Give me something to draw with,

648
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,067
The Crystal Heart!

649
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:11,774
That's the treasure of the Land of lce!
ln the lce Castle,

650
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:15,648
lt can freeze anything - even time,

651
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:19,120
l've always dreamt
of freezing a moment in time,

652
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,817
And the lce Castle's
ruled by the lce Princess,

653
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,759
l hear she's the most beautiful girl
on the planet,

654
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,152
Ouch!

655
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:30,063
She is not! She's cold and cruel
and cares for nobody but herself,

656
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,567
She's just saying that, Max,

657
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,799
- Have you met her?
- No, But l know we don't get along,

658
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:40,104
- How do you know that?
- l'm fire, She's ice,

659
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,236
We must be enemies,

660
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,610
We need that Crystal Heart,

661
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:47,275
But l need you both to get it,

662
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,252
l just hope this isn't a trap,

663
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,719
Whoa!

664
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,893
lf we freeze time with the Crystal Heart,

665
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,692
we'll be able to make it to the Dream Lair
and save the planet,

666
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,756
That's the plan,

667
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,130
Behold the lce Castle!

668
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:11,003
Home to the Princess of the Land of lce,

669
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:15,374
- The Crystal Heart's inside the castle?
- So they say,

670
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,572
Let's go,

671
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,548
<i>(sizzling)</i>

672
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,566
lt's no use! l'll melt the bridge,

673
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,002
This place inflames me,

674
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,506
Can you cool down enough to get across?

675
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,667
l'd have to be asleep to do that,

676
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,844
Can you try sleepwalking?

677
00:50:54,985 --> 00:51:00,184
My dream is to live on Earth -
but someplace warm -

678
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,417
and that Earth will accept me,

679
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:06,225
<i>even,,, if l,,, destroy,,,</i>

680
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,262
<i>everything l,,, touch!</i>

681
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,735
No, Lavagirl! Don't sneeze!

682
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,834
Aaa-tchoo!

683
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,904
<i>Aarghh,,,</i>

684
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:30,946
Look,

685
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,989
<i>(small snore)</i>

686
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,081
She's sleeping,

687
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,774
<i>(distant barking)</i>

688
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,737
- They've found us again! Lavagirl!
- Shh!

689
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,475
lf you wake her up, she'll reheat,

690
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,315
She can make it,

691
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:13,361
Lavagirl, they're behind you!

692
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,197
<i>(growls)</i>

693
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,793
<i>(both scream)</i>

694
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,715
- Let's go, Hurry!
- Argh!

695
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,484
lt's a trap!

696
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:47,195
You can almost feel
the electricity in the air, can't you?

697
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:51,894
This is all wrong,
Someone else's dreams are in here,

698
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:54,095
Lights out!

699
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:10,016
Welcome to the Dream Lair!

700
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,987
l am the ruler of Planet Drool,

701
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:16,492
No, you're not! Max is!

702
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:20,420
<i>Max may have dreamed it originally,,,</i>

703
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,730
<i>but l am much,,, cooler,</i>

704
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,337
<i>l,,, am Minus,</i>

705
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,903
How'd you get so powerful?

706
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,138
l do a lot of reading,

707
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,942
My book of dreams!

708
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:42,246
That's why everything's so messed up -
he's changing it!

709
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,685
Electric eels,

710
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:48,482
<i>(yelps)</i>

711
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,527
Shocking, isn't it, Sharkboy?

712
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:58,467
Reminds me of the time that electrical
storm blew apart your father's laboratory,

713
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,197
- Where is my father?
- Hm,

714
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,263
Let's see,

715
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:10,109
Check the bottom of the ocean,

716
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,482
<i>And Lavagirl,,,</i>

717
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:18,544
Once l figure out
how to freeze this planet's core,

718
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,182
all of your powers will disappear,

719
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,125
Powers? What powers?

720
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:30,226
And last but least, Max,

721
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,497
You thought you could escape fear
by running away to dreamland,

722
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:38,473
But fear exists
in the one place you can never escape!

723
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,567
Your mind!

724
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,312
l will show you the true meaning of fear,

725
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,442
When darkness falls,
the rest of your dreams will be destroyed

726
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,214
and l will rule Planet Drool,

727
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,917
<i>Blah-blah-blah, threat-threat-threat,,,</i>

728
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:59,519
You must all leave now,
l have some dreaming to do,

729
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,488
Whoa!

730
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,373
lf l could just get my dream journal,

731
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,707
l could turn everything
back to the way it was,

732
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,778
My fire's dimming,

733
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,908
<i>(faint sizzling)</i>

734
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,680
l can't melt the bars,

735
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:26,722
My strength is failing me as well,

736
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:30,385
How much time do we have, Sharkboy?

737
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,863
Who cares?
We're never getting out of here,

738
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,990
<i>(happy singing)</i>

739
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,126
La La's,

740
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:42,194
<i>(bubbling and squeaking)</i>

741
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,536
They like you,

742
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,977
<i>- l don't feel distracted right now,
- (Sharkboy) l do!</i>

743
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,242
This song is driving me crazy!

744
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:56,342
Don't worry about him,
He's a cold fish,

745
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,478
l'm serious!

746
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:02,281
<i>They're singing at a frequency,,,</i>

747
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,827
<i>my highly trained ears find,,,</i>

748
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,555
disturbing!

749
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,995
Sing louder, Sing higher,

750
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:11,533
<i>(L a La's sing louder)</i>

751
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,667
You don't wanna be too close to him
when he explodes,

752
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,331
Aaargghh!

753
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,035
Shark frenzy!

754
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:35,090
Nice job channeling your anger, Sharkie,

755
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,284
Huh,

756
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,364
<i>(snores)</i>

757
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:10,150
First things first,
Transportation out of here,

Lavagirl, you have a lava bike!

760

761
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,931
l do!

762

<i>(revs)</i>

This is so exciting!

764
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:32,139
Cool it, Lavagirl,

765
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,309
Everything we need
is right here in this book,

766
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:43,583
<i>Sharkboy,,, your father really is
at the bottom of the ocean,</i>

767
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,334
He's in a submarine,

768
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,995
Looking for you!

769
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:02,073
He's over the hydrothermal vents,
Mid-Atlantic Ridge,

770
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:06,582
42 degrees west by 1 4 north,
Depth: 1 800 meters,

771
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,742
Near a snake pit!

772
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,581
l need to get back to Earth,

773
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:14,350
- What's it say about me?
- l'm not sure what this is,

774
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:17,552
l can figure it out, Maybe there's
a section on my true identity,

775
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,618
Lavagirl, no!

776
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:24,031
Oh, no, What have l done?

777
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,364
That's terrific, LG!

778
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:33,474
lt's OK, Lavagirl,
lt was an accident,

779
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,575
Why did you make me out of lava?!
Why, Max?

780
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:43,414
Just let her cool down,
She's just blowing off steam,

781
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,422
l know l can be good,

782
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,254
l can feel it,

783
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,598
But everything l touch, l destroy,

784
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:04,668
Why did you make me like that?
l have more potential,

785
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,868
l'm sure you do,

786
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:12,473
And why'd you make us a team?
We're nothing alike,

787
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:16,542
When l'm near water, l fizzle out,
When he's near heat, he shrivels,

788
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,416
We're not compatible,

789
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,082
<i>Your,,, hair's on fire,</i>

790
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,593
Yeah, it does that,

791
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,822
Thanks, Sharkie,

792
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,868
Maybe l really am evil,

793
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:41,203
So far everything else you've dreamed
has been correct,

794
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,939
Maybe l just need to learn to accept it,

795
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:49,581
That's it! Everything l've dreamt so far
has been correct,

796
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,381
The Crystal Heart!

797
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:57,051
Yeah, we were captured, but that's
'cause Minus doesn't want me to get it,

798
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,287
<i>(thunderclap)</i>

799
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,455
We have to get back to the lce Castle,

800
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:06,093
1 0 minutes left, We'll never make it!

801
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,899
<i>- We can do it!
- (both) How?</i>

802
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:13,742
You're Sharkboy and Lavagirl,
You can do anything,

803
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,218
Wake up!

804
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:25,654
What?

805
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:29,658
He escaped,
And he's getting the Crystal Heart,

806
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,887
Shut it down, Shut it all down now!

807
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:36,421
l did, lt's on a grid system,
lt takes time for the darkness to travel,

808
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:39,093
- How soon?
- Not soon enough,

809
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:41,602
- Then destroy him,
- How?

810
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:47,371
By smashing his most precious dream:
Sharkboy and Lavagirl,

811
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,963
ls that what you saw, Max?

812
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,193
Yes,

813
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:14,668
You'll have to climb the ice pillar and get it,

814
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:18,571
lt's as delicate as a snowflake,
so don't drop it,

815
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:22,008
And don't touch it with your hands either -
you'll freeze,

816
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,103
Use your claws,

817
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,786
<i>Aaarrhh,,,</i>

818
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,822
<i>Lava, can you,,,?</i>

819
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,456
Never mind,

820
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:47,330
Chew on some ice, lt'll keep you cool,

821
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:53,864
Hm,

822
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,662
Great job, Max,

823
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,010
l got it!

824
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:38,253
She's frozen solid!

825
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,208
Kneel before the lce Princess,

826
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:12,112
You tried to steal the Crystal Heart,
Why?

827
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:20,291
We believe it can freeze time,
Long enough for us to defeat Minus,

828
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:25,096
My Crystal Heart cannot help you,
Only l have the power to use it,

829
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:28,228
- Then come with us,
- She can never leave this castle,

830
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:33,799
The crystal is the only thing
that protects our kingdom,

831
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:36,538
Please, Princess,
We're running out of time,

832
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,944
Perhaps l could give it to you,

833
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:42,781
- Not without my blessing,
- Father, you're smothering me again,

834
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,352
But are you worthy to wield it?

835
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,753
Yes,

836
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,452
The crystal you stole was a decoy,

837
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:54,018
The true Crystal Heart
is somewhere in this room,

838
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:58,260
Choose the correct one,
and you may carry it before you,

839
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,062
Pick that one,

840
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,196
lt's around your neck,

841
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:10,200
- How'd you know?
- l saw it in my dream,

842
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,512
Usually, if you snooze, you lose,
With Max, you snooze, you win,

843
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,983
But be warned, Max,
if anything happens to my Crystal Heart,

844
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:28,519
my entire kingdom will be destroyed,

845
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:32,728
<i>(king) Do you, Max, take this Crystal Heart
to have and to hold,</i>

846
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:36,238
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

847
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:37,363
l do,

848
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,840
- Do you trust him with your heart?
- l do,

849
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:42,309
Do you mean what you say?

850
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:44,177
Yes,

851
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,147
l mean, l do,

852
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:50,174
The crystal will now work -
but my daughter must stay here,

853
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,312
Off with you, then!

854
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,855
Good luck,

855
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:04,199
We're almost at the Dream Lair!

856

lf we're gonna do this, we gotta do it now!

857

- How much time?
- We're out of time!

858

- lt didn't work,

867
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:38,059
How could it not work?

<i>l was trying to tell you! Whoa,,,</i>

869
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,666
Only the lce Princess can use it,

870
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:49,905
lt's not her fault
her father won't let her leave her castle,

You know - watts,

As in a measure of electrical power,

886
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:34,522
The 60-watt bulb?

887

No one special,

Wouldn't dream of it,

983
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:44,032
Don't smash people's dreams, Linus,
because you'll smash your own as well,

Everything will return

You will be able to travel to Earth

You can search for your father,
You can rule Earth's lava world,

And what am l to do,
now that you're all buddy-buddy?

1002
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:47,062
Mr, Electric can go back

Oh, really?

l am the danger of dreaming,

there's the one
who dreams up the atom bomb,

We're in the middle of Texas in August!
