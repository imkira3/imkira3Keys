1
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:03,920
The subject's name is John Kramer,

2
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,828
a 52-year-old male Caucasian.

3
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:10,799
He's seen better days.

4
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:48,604
We have a recent
rectangular transection

5
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:50,800
to the left occipital lobe.

6
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:54,036
Some kind of backdoor
brain surgery.

7
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:27,635
Let's check the stomach.

8
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,682
What the hell?

9
00:04:50,962 --> 00:04:53,795
Get homicide here, now.

10
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:03,040
Where is it?

11
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:05,804
It was in his stomach.

12
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,146
Cut it out.

13
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:44,582
Are you there, Detective?

14
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,844
If so, you are probably

15
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:49,216
the last man standing.

16
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,687
Now perhaps you will succeed

17
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:54,190
where the others have failed.

18
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:57,160
You think you will
walk away untested?

19
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:59,025
I promise

20
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,531
that my work will continue.

21
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,592
You think it's over
just because I'm dead?

22
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:06,637
It's not over.

23
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:09,265
The games have just begun.

24
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:25,315
What the fuck? What the fuck?

25
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,326
What the fuck?

26
00:06:28,393 --> 00:06:31,191
My eyes!

27
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,628
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

28
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:36,098
What the fuck is this?

29
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:47,274
Who's that?

30
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:51,113
Talk to me.
What are you doing?

31
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:53,150
Talk to me.

32
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:07,791
Talk to me.

33
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:16,765
Stop it!

34
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:19,766
Stop.

35
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,011
Stop it.

36
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,537
What are you doing to me?

37
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:56,045
What did I do?
Help!

38
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:57,479
Help!

39
00:07:57,549 --> 00:07:59,983
Who's doing this to me?

40
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:16,766
Just get away from me!

41
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:25,299
What did I do?

42
00:09:57,969 --> 00:10:01,029
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

43
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,367
Clear.

44
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:08,808
In position.
Standing by.

45
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,848
Hold right there.

46
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:14,217
I see movement.

47
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:21,150
We have a device.

48
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:22,693
You get eyes in there
before you go in.

49
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,990
Get some eyes in here.

50
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:27,031
Moving now.

51
00:10:42,914 --> 00:10:44,176
The doorway is clear.

52
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:21,146
It's Kerry!

53
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:23,585
- Rigg!
- Don't do it! We're not secure!

54
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:25,623
- Rigg, I said no!
- Kerry!

55
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,885
- Stop him!
- Do not go through that door.

56
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:30,895
Kerry!

57
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:32,930
Shit.

58
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:58,522
- Get me the coroner's office.
- Copy.

59
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:00,557
Somebody get those rats off her.

60
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,262
Let's get the light on this.

61
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:13,627
Cut her down.

62
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:15,536
You know I can't do that.

63
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:20,074
I said cut her down.

64
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:23,707
Please.

65
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:32,184
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

66
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,523
You know never to go
through an unsecured door, ever.

67
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:38,459
I thought she was still alive,

68
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:41,157
thought I could save her.

69
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,301
Did you ever think
that we would end up here

70
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,337
when we first started?

71
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:50,099
No.

72
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:52,574
I didn't see it
happening like this.

73
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,170
Why the hell do we still do it?

74
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:59,808
It's in our nature to save them.

75
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:02,580
- It's what we do.
- Right.

76
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,986
"Cherish Your Life."

77
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:07,854
- What?
- The fucking motto.

78
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:11,053
We're supposed to cherish
our lives.

79
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,687
How the hell are we
supposed to do that

80
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:14,732
when this is our life?

81
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:20,861
We chose this.

82
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:22,803
- You go home.
- Hoffman, there are two agents

83
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:25,274
- here to see you.
- Copy.

84
00:13:28,146 --> 00:13:30,341
- Detective Hoffman?
- Yes.

85
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:32,781
I'm special agent Lindsey Perez.

86
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,613
This is special agent Peter Strahm.

87
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:36,744
How can I help the FBI?

88
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:40,188
We're here about Detective Kerry.
She was our liaison.

89
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:41,987
"Open the door
and you will find me."

90
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:44,551
What?

91
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:51,394
- What's this?
- The key that came

92
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:53,369
with out last message
from Detective Kerry.

93
00:13:53,438 --> 00:13:55,929
"Open the door and you will find me"
mean anything to you?

94
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:57,634
No.

95
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:07,411
Where's the body?

96
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:10,977
The crime scene photographer's flash
picked up this bullet casing.

97
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:13,182
It was lodged between the body
and the device.

98
00:14:13,257 --> 00:14:15,225
Run it for prints.

99
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:24,496
Give us the room for a minute,
would you? Thanks.

100
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:32,675
The lock was open.

101
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:34,176
She couldn't get out.

102
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:38,147
It was constructed for her execution.
Betrayed the rules.

103
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:39,945
Not a Jigsaw trap then?

104
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:42,508
No, Amanda Young,
the accomplice...

105
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:45,317
- This wasn't done by Amanda Young.
- Excuse me?

106
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:47,653
Detective Kerry weighed
approximately 130 lbs.

107
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:49,693
Amanda Young's arrest report
has her at 107.

108
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,955
- She couldn't get her up there alone.
- John Kramer was...

109
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,497
The bedridden cancer patient?
He's brains, not brawn.

110
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:56,692
He was also an engineer.
He could have rigged pulleys...

111
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,827
Or someone else
could have helped him.

112
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:02,964
Special agent, if you're here for any
other reason than just to assist...

113
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,531
We're here to find the person
your department couldn't, Detective,

114
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,373
the one helping Jigsaw
and Amanda Young.

115
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:10,414
Excuse me.

116
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:19,413
We found a harlequin doll in your
possession. What's that about?

117
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,685
It's a toy.
The kids play with toys.

118
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,193
That's all it is.

119
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:27,356
How about the tricycle?

120
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:29,524
The tricycle is from John's youth.

121
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,660
A grown man has
a tricycle his whole life?

122
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:34,932
I'm sure you've kept things
that were important to you.

123
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:37,099
Look, Ms. Tuck,

124
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:39,143
is there any reason
we should be concerned

125
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,269
for your safety?

126
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:43,677
Perhaps you should be
more concerned for yourself.

127
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:45,716
Why don't you tell me
everything you know about John?

128
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:47,273
And let's start at the beginning.

129
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:51,014
John's life defies chronology
and linear description.

130
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:54,421
So why don't we start at the end
and work our way backwards?

131
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:56,050
I represent Ms. Tuck.

132
00:15:58,362 --> 00:16:00,091
She knows something.

133
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:02,223
I thought you were going home.

134
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,997
You have vacation time, right?
Take it.

135
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,402
Finish the remodeling,
spend some time with Tracy.

136
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:10,940
- She understands.
- Then don't take her for granted.

137
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:15,309
- Eric is still out there, man.
- Eric's been missing for six months.

138
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:18,371
Kerry was gone for four days.
I can only be as optimistic

139
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:20,917
- as the facts allow.
- Yeah, well, I'm in it till I find him.

140
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:22,782
Finding his body is not gonna
vindicate us.

141
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:24,718
Finding him alive will.

142
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,916
It's time to let go.

143
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:28,925
I want you to go home.

144
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:31,791
I'll call you later to make sure
everything is okay.

145
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,929
Who's he?

146
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:39,765
Lieutenant Rigg,
our SWAT commander.

147
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:43,204
- What's his problem?
- Everyone around him keeps dying.

148
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:06,696
What's it say?

149
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:09,824
It says, "I tried calling you
four times."

150
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,232
It says, "Dinner is in the fridge."

151
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:17,405
And at the bottom it says,
"I love you."

152
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:19,534
I need to help my mom

153
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,840
for a few days.

154
00:17:21,912 --> 00:17:23,743
Just...

155
00:17:23,814 --> 00:17:26,908
come with me, okay? Now.

156
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:28,918
I can't.

157
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:32,854
You can,

158
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:35,323
but you won't.

159
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:37,657
What you can't do

160
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:39,923
is save everyone.

161
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:50,970
Tracy.

162
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:53,636
Tracy, please listen to me.

163
00:18:06,424 --> 00:18:09,860
John Kramer owned a company called
The Urban Renewal Group.

164
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:12,020
No irony in that, huh?

165
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:14,155
What was Rigg watching?

166
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:18,133
Jill Tuck's interrogation.
She was Jigsaw's ex. It's old.

167
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:20,170
Why is a SWAT guy watching that?

168
00:18:20,237 --> 00:18:24,139
Strahm, I really think
we should tell Hoffman

169
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,142
what Detective Kerry said
in her last message.

170
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,509
She said two officers
might be in danger,

171
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,571
but until we know who,
we're not causing a panic.

172
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:34,117
If Detective Hoffman or anyone else
in this precinct is in danger,

173
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:36,016
- I think they should know it.
- Not your call.

174
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:41,789
Making any progress?

175
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:46,087
We're fine, thanks.

176
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:48,893
Hey, boss, looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital.

177
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,900
- Maybe it's...
- Thanks.

178
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:52,936
I'll check it out.

179
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:55,972
If you need me, call my cell.
Coffee machine is around the corner.

180
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,508
- A boy or a girl?
- A girl.

181
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:00,168
- I didn't know you were married.
- I'm not.

182
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:02,769
It's a short story, believe me.

183
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:26,336
Tracy.

184
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:42,947
Tracy?

185
00:21:27,992 --> 00:21:29,960
Hello, Officer Rigg.

186
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,018
Welcome to your rebirth.

187
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:33,290
Fuck.

188
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:35,662
For years you've stood by
and witnessed

189
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:37,701
as your colleagues have fallen.

190
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:40,362
You have remained untouched

191
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:42,871
while Eric Matthews
has disappeared.

192
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,966
But with your survival
came your obsession...

193
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:48,011
obsession to stop
those around you

194
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:50,137
from making the wrong choices,

195
00:21:50,214 --> 00:21:53,240
thus preventing you
from making the right ones.

196
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:55,285
You wanted to save everyone.

197
00:21:55,352 --> 00:21:57,479
Tonight I give you
the opportunity

198
00:21:57,555 --> 00:22:00,183
to face your obsession.
Look closely.

199
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:03,420
Eric Matthews is still alive.

200
00:22:03,494 --> 00:22:06,190
- Eric.
- The block of ice he stands upon

201
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:08,094
is melting.

202
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:11,225
He has but 90 minutes
to save himself.

203
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:15,295
Detective Hoffman's fate is linked
to Eric's survival.

204
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:18,535
Heed my warning,
Officer Rigg.

205
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:20,770
Their lives hang in the balance

206
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:22,812
of your obsession.

207
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,077
Will you learn how to let go
and truly save them?

208
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,414
The choice is yours.

209
00:23:03,253 --> 00:23:05,517
Don't fucking move.

210
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,335
Jesus.

211
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:23,999
Take off the mask.
Put your hands in the air.

212
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:26,440
I can't!

213
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:40,590
Officer Rigg, your first test.

214
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:43,991
The person in front of you
is in desperate need of help.

215
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:46,621
But it is not your job
to save them.

216
00:23:46,697 --> 00:23:48,597
You view this person as a victim.

217
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,657
But if you want to see what I see,

218
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:53,294
beneath the mask lies a criminal

219
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,338
undeserving of the life she leads.

220
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:04,942
Your obsession tells you
to save the victim.

221
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:09,179
I tell you to walk away.
The choice is yours.

222
00:24:10,354 --> 00:24:12,481
- Are you a cop?
- What?

223
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:14,683
- Are you a cop?
- Yeah, I'm a cop.

224
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:20,855
What is that?
What did you do?

225
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,170
- They're in the gears.
- What's in the gears?

226
00:24:32,242 --> 00:24:35,541
The combination.
Get me out.

227
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:40,139
Cut my hair. Just get me out.
Cut my hair.

228
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:41,684
- Relax, relax.
- Hurry!

229
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:45,687
Fucking cut my hair, please.

230
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:47,246
Get me out!

231
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,851
Please.
Where are you going?

232
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:54,193
Wait wait wait wait.

233
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:56,164
Wait wait.

234
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:57,291
- Shit.
- Wait!

235
00:24:58,535 --> 00:25:00,298
Stop!

236
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:02,703
Fucking let me out!

237
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:06,208
Get back here, you fucking...!

238
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:10,644
Okay, I'm sorry.
Please come back.

239
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,030
Where the hell is the combination?

240
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:34,934
Shit. Shit.

241
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:41,010
Hold on! Hold on!

242
00:25:43,947 --> 00:25:46,347
I got one.

243
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:48,782
I got one. Hold on!

244
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:51,013
- Hold on.
- Hurry!

245
00:25:53,657 --> 00:25:55,420
Oh, God.

246
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:01,123
- Yeah?
- We pulled a print off that casing.

247
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:03,166
We've got a match.

248
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:05,701
Jesus. Did you check this?

249
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:06,827
Twice.

250
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:11,440
Come on, come on, come on.

251
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:14,306
I got another one. Hold on!

252
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,110
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Hurry!

253
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:20,309
I got it. 617. 617.

254
00:26:20,384 --> 00:26:22,352
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

255
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:31,226
Go!

256
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:34,162
Shit.

257
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:36,665
Okay okay okay, listen,

258
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,860
stay here. Don't touch anything.

259
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:03,185
What the fuck?

260
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:08,431
What the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?

261
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:09,795
Drop the fucking knife!

262
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:11,732
- Please.
- Put the knife down.

263
00:27:11,802 --> 00:27:13,770
Put the knife down.

264
00:27:13,837 --> 00:27:16,431
I just saved your fucking life.

265
00:27:18,275 --> 00:27:20,709
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Drop the knife.

266
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:32,285
Hey, these prints just came in.
They're from Officer Rigg.

267
00:27:32,356 --> 00:27:33,948
- Fisk.
- Not now.

268
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:36,652
We just got a call of "shots fired"
from 23 Park Place.

269
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:39,127
That's Rigg's apartment.

270
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:48,204
Hello, Brenda.

271
00:27:48,272 --> 00:27:50,297
I want to play a game.

272
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:53,241
An officer will try to save you.

273
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,076
If he is successful,
then your game begins.

274
00:27:57,147 --> 00:27:59,615
This man will use these photos

275
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:02,311
to sentence you for your crimes.

276
00:28:02,386 --> 00:28:04,354
And the only way to stop him

277
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:06,412
is taped underneath the TV.

278
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,593
Let him save your life

279
00:28:10,661 --> 00:28:13,027
and accept your fate
to rot in prison,

280
00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:15,564
or kill him

281
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:17,862
and guarantee your freedom.

282
00:28:17,935 --> 00:28:20,301
Make your choice.

283
00:29:24,634 --> 00:29:26,602
I'll fucking kill you,

284
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,104
you fucking bitch!

285
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:26,388
Rigg!

286
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:30,161
- Rigg, you in here? Rigg!
- Go! Move move move!

287
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:34,037
Christ.

288
00:30:34,104 --> 00:30:36,072
I got one.

289
00:30:37,908 --> 00:30:39,876
I got one.

290
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,888
It's started.

291
00:30:53,557 --> 00:30:56,082
An APB has been issued for Rigg.
Everybody's looking.

292
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,185
- He has a wife. Where is she?
- We haven't located her yet.

293
00:30:59,262 --> 00:31:01,924
Strahm...

294
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:04,364
two detectives. You see this?

295
00:31:05,402 --> 00:31:07,233
Hoffman... you got a 20 on him?

296
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:08,635
Not yet.

297
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:10,263
- Hoffman.
- Calling.

298
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,433
How do you explain
Detective Matthews?

299
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:14,340
- He's alive.
- Six months.

300
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:17,539
- Jigsaw never kept anyone that long.
- No one but Amanda Young.

301
00:31:18,582 --> 00:31:20,447
You think he's been fixed?

302
00:31:20,517 --> 00:31:22,348
Why these six?

303
00:31:26,323 --> 00:31:28,985
Hoffman's a decorated lieutenant.
He doesn't fit the profile.

304
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:32,028
That's what you see.
But what does he see?

305
00:31:33,296 --> 00:31:35,491
- Rigg trying to save his two friends.
- Maybe.

306
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,999
You got names and locations
on any of these people?

307
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:39,933
- Working it.
- This is overkill.

308
00:31:40,003 --> 00:31:42,631
It's a setup to announce
Rigg is the accomplice.

309
00:31:42,706 --> 00:31:45,573
Or a setup for his alibi.
Everyone around him keeps dying.

310
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:48,372
Where is he to tell us he's innocent
or what the hell these photos

311
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:51,573
are doing in his apartment?
Look there.

312
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:55,585
Move, please.

313
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:57,847
"Four Walls Build a Home."

314
00:31:57,921 --> 00:31:59,889
What does he want us to see
on these walls?

315
00:31:59,956 --> 00:32:01,890
The victims?

316
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,722
One of these pictures
doesn't belong.

317
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:13,736
This is who we're looking for.

318
00:32:14,804 --> 00:32:17,364
Let's talk to her, now.

319
00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:24,514
Jill Tuck... where is she?

320
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:35,449
Have them turn off the air in there.

321
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:44,057
Ms. Tuck,

322
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:47,194
I'm special agent Perez.
This is special agent Strahm.

323
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,795
I'd like to apologize for pulling
you out of your place of work.

324
00:32:49,873 --> 00:32:51,465
What more do you think
I can offer you?

325
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:54,408
My 100 hours of interrogation tapes

326
00:32:54,477 --> 00:32:56,707
and the volumes of evidence
taken from my house

327
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,112
weren't enough for you
to understand John?

328
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:03,152
Actually, it's not John we want
to talk about, Ms. Tuck. It's you.

329
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,710
Me?

330
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:07,348
Why do you want to talk about me?
This isn't about me.

331
00:33:07,424 --> 00:33:10,257
So stop wasting both of our time
and get to the real reason

332
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:12,727
why you've brought me here.

333
00:33:37,954 --> 00:33:39,922
Hey, you.

334
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:48,129
Let me go!

335
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:49,927
Hey!

336
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:54,395
You hear me?

337
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:56,234
You fucking hear me,

338
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:59,104
you fucking motherfucker?

339
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:17,853
Who's my girl?

340
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:23,032
What the fuck are you looking at?

341
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,828
Huh? What the fuck...?

342
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:27,301
Hey, you!

343
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,964
Sir, sir,

344
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,065
sir, can I help you?

345
00:35:39,676 --> 00:35:41,644
Hello, Officer Rigg.
In order for you

346
00:35:41,711 --> 00:35:43,906
to fully understand my way,

347
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,438
you must...
feel what I feel.

348
00:35:47,517 --> 00:35:49,883
The photo before you is of a man

349
00:35:49,953 --> 00:35:53,252
- in desperate need of help.
- Sir?

350
00:35:53,323 --> 00:35:56,918
In the next room are the tools
to his salvation.

351
00:35:56,993 --> 00:35:59,655
His life is in your hands.

352
00:35:59,729 --> 00:36:03,062
But in the end
only he can save himself.

353
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:08,229
Be careful.
There are cameras watching...

354
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:13,271
and you must hide your identity.

355
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:16,902
Make your choice.

356
00:36:18,014 --> 00:36:20,039
- Sir?
- What the fuck's he doing?

357
00:36:20,116 --> 00:36:22,243
I don't know. You're gonna have to...
Look, look,

358
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:24,309
- you're gonna have to go.
- People are trying to sleep.

359
00:36:24,387 --> 00:36:26,821
Yeah, I know people are
trying to sleep. You're the one...

360
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,256
Yeah, you can't sleep here.
You have to go.

361
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:31,657
Yeah, well, you can't sleep
in here, okay?

362
00:36:31,728 --> 00:36:34,094
That's not a bed.
No, you've got to go.

363
00:36:34,164 --> 00:36:36,428
No, you can't use the bathroom.
Look, look, no.

364
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:37,932
You're gonna have to go.
All right...

365
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:46,165
Chance, here, girl.

366
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:53,238
Chance. Chance.

367
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:57,379
Chance.

368
00:36:58,988 --> 00:37:00,956
What are you doing?
Come on.

369
00:37:01,024 --> 00:37:02,992
Chance.

370
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:12,031
Chance, come here.
Come here.

371
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,701
What you got there, huh?
What you got?

372
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:25,145
Come here. Come here.
What do you got there?

373
00:37:33,857 --> 00:37:38,624
Okay, "Four walls build a home."

374
00:37:38,695 --> 00:37:41,926
- Care to shed any light on that?
- Light on what?

375
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:44,091
On what your photos are doing
at the crime scene.

376
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,431
"Four walls build a home"
ring any bells?

377
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:53,708
"Cherish your life"?

378
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:57,046
"Cherish your life"
is the concept

379
00:37:57,113 --> 00:37:59,081
that this whole clinic
was built on...

380
00:37:59,148 --> 00:38:01,173
cherish your life... your life.

381
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:04,118
- That's his motto.
- No, it's your motto...

382
00:38:04,187 --> 00:38:06,883
of the clinic you run.

383
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:10,255
Fuck, man.
I've been here for three fucking hours!

384
00:38:10,326 --> 00:38:12,726
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut up.

385
00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:14,558
Are you out of your fucking mind?

386
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:16,622
Hey hey.

387
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:18,599
Hey, guys, come on.
Calm down.

388
00:38:18,668 --> 00:38:20,693
Cecil!

389
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,897
Stop it, Gus.

390
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:25,270
Knock it off now, please!

391
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:31,878
You don't want to do that.

392
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:34,109
- What the fuck is your problem?
- You're my problem.

393
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:38,052
You're becoming
everybody else's too.

394
00:38:45,628 --> 00:38:49,621
How do you feel about a husband

395
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:52,224
who takes a motto
from your drug clinic,

396
00:38:52,302 --> 00:38:54,600
designed to help people,
and twists it

397
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:57,731
into some manic torture mantra?

398
00:38:57,807 --> 00:39:01,334
That part of John
has nothing to do with me.

399
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,448
Look, Ms. Tuck,
I just left a room

400
00:39:06,516 --> 00:39:08,484
with more blood on the walls
than paint.

401
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:11,384
Two officers are missing and
there's a growing pile of bodies

402
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:14,890
in their wake.
And every detail we unearth

403
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:17,620
about your Hall of Fame
psychopath husband...

404
00:39:17,694 --> 00:39:19,321
- Ex.
...points to you

405
00:39:19,395 --> 00:39:21,192
as a possible accomplice.

406
00:39:21,264 --> 00:39:24,529
I am just curious as to why.

407
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:26,626
You know, there's a lot of people
out there

408
00:39:26,703 --> 00:39:28,671
looking for answers,

409
00:39:28,738 --> 00:39:30,968
wanting to place blame
on someone.

410
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,873
That person is you.

411
00:39:33,943 --> 00:39:36,036
But you know
what the best part is?

412
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:38,342
I don't have to
convince everybody.

413
00:39:38,414 --> 00:39:40,609
Just 12 people.

414
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:46,082
Okay, tell me
about his workshop.

415
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:54,494
Stay there.
Let me get the lights.

416
00:39:58,001 --> 00:39:59,366
Wow, it's big.

417
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:02,666
This is exactly
what you've been looking for.

418
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:04,001
Nice, huh?

419
00:40:05,174 --> 00:40:06,801
Ta-da!

420
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:10,471
This is the clock?
What's so special about it?

421
00:40:10,546 --> 00:40:12,707
Except for the fact
the whole deal hung on it?

422
00:40:12,782 --> 00:40:14,682
The mechanism inside it.

423
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:16,981
It's 300 years old.

424
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:18,987
Still ticking.

425
00:40:19,055 --> 00:40:22,047
Withstood the test of time.

426
00:40:24,527 --> 00:40:27,553
Wait till you see this space.

427
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:34,701
I've got a surprise for you.

428
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:51,053
Why are you doing this?

429
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:54,790
Why?

430
00:40:58,561 --> 00:41:00,688
This was... this was a mistake.

431
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:04,199
It happened a long time ago.
And I paid for this.

432
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:06,064
Just let me...
just let me go, okay?

433
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:11,569
What's behind that door?

434
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:14,974
"One saves a life.
One takes it away."

435
00:41:17,513 --> 00:41:19,481
Try that on the door.
Try that.

436
00:41:25,154 --> 00:41:27,179
- Oh, no no.
- Get back. Get back. Get back.

437
00:41:27,256 --> 00:41:28,848
Let's go. Go.

438
00:42:02,191 --> 00:42:05,319
Eric. Jesus.

439
00:42:05,394 --> 00:42:08,158
- Help! Help me!
- Get away from there.

440
00:42:09,832 --> 00:42:12,801
What do you know about the guy on TV?
What do you know about Eric Matthews?

441
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:14,837
I don't know who that is.

442
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:19,034
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know.

443
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:25,473
What are you gonna do to me?

444
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:30,709
If you are playing this tape,
then you are one step closer

445
00:42:30,787 --> 00:42:33,915
to truly understanding
how to save a life.

446
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,788
As an officer of the law,
you find yourself torn...

447
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:38,554
- Who is that?
- Shut up.

448
00:42:38,628 --> 00:42:41,791
- Is the man before you a victim
or a perpetrator of violence?

449
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,066
You sick fuck.

450
00:42:45,134 --> 00:42:47,364
His salvation is out of your hands.

451
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:52,037
It is your choice, if you wish,

452
00:42:52,108 --> 00:42:54,076
to put it into his own.

453
00:42:54,143 --> 00:42:56,111
Once this lesson is learned,

454
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:58,170
you will find yourself
one step closer

455
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:00,807
to truly saving Eric Matthews.

456
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:03,852
Without you this man's game
cannot begin.

457
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,447
Force him into position
to face his demons

458
00:43:07,523 --> 00:43:10,515
and let him make the decision.

459
00:43:16,132 --> 00:43:19,192
Shh. Don't wake up our neighbors.

460
00:43:21,537 --> 00:43:24,631
Fuck. Is this what you do
with your spare time, huh?

461
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:25,833
No.

462
00:43:25,908 --> 00:43:28,706
Take it all, little girl.
Be a good little whore.

463
00:43:28,778 --> 00:43:31,440
Get on the fucking bed.
Get on the bed!

464
00:43:31,514 --> 00:43:33,880
Move!

465
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,510
Strap yourself in.
Strap yourself in.

466
00:43:36,586 --> 00:43:38,713
Please don't make me do this.
I know...

467
00:43:38,788 --> 00:43:40,949
I know I was wrong.
I know.

468
00:43:42,925 --> 00:43:45,052
Hurry up. Hurry up.

469
00:43:45,127 --> 00:43:47,960
Put your fucking hands up.

470
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:51,527
I don't know. I don't know.

471
00:43:51,601 --> 00:43:52,932
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

472
00:43:57,173 --> 00:44:00,233
Listen, I'm really sorry.

473
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:03,437
What does that say?
What does that say?

474
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,611
What is that?

475
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,918
- Take them.
- Why?

476
00:44:17,193 --> 00:44:19,559
Hello, lvan. As a voyeur,

477
00:44:19,629 --> 00:44:22,325
you've kept photos of those
you have victimized.

478
00:44:23,366 --> 00:44:25,334
- Let me go!
- Can you see the pain

479
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:27,369
you have brought them?

480
00:44:27,436 --> 00:44:29,631
You have torn apart their lives.

481
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:33,402
You have used your body
as an instrument of abuse.

482
00:44:33,476 --> 00:44:35,808
Now I give you the chance
to decide

483
00:44:35,878 --> 00:44:38,847
what is more important...

484
00:44:38,915 --> 00:44:42,282
your eyes which have led you
blindly astray

485
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:44,649
or your body

486
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,688
which has caused those around you

487
00:44:46,756 --> 00:44:49,156
endless suffering.

488
00:44:49,225 --> 00:44:52,285
You have been handed the tools
which can save your life.

489
00:44:52,361 --> 00:44:55,159
Decide quickly, though.
In 60 seconds

490
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:58,928
the choice will be made for you.

491
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:13,179
I can do it. One more.
I can do it.

492
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:45,147
You're gonna have to tell me
how you got

493
00:45:45,214 --> 00:45:48,650
those bruises on your hand
and your neck.

494
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:53,416
Was this an accident or did someone
do this to you on purpose?

495
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:57,619
You can stop it from happening
if you tell me the truth.

496
00:45:58,728 --> 00:46:00,992
Take a seat, please.

497
00:46:01,063 --> 00:46:02,758
I want to go home now.

498
00:46:08,104 --> 00:46:09,935
The son of a bitch is lying.

499
00:46:10,006 --> 00:46:12,839
He's done this before.
She's allowing it.

500
00:46:12,908 --> 00:46:16,400
The child's story doesn't corroborate.
What can I do?

501
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:18,913
Jane, I can't let you go home
right now, okay?

502
00:46:18,981 --> 00:46:20,744
Go back to class, honey.

503
00:46:20,816 --> 00:46:22,943
I told you, Officers,
sometimes these kids...

504
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:25,112
they just get out of control.

505
00:46:25,187 --> 00:46:27,155
- Get your hands off me!
- Hey, take it easy.

506
00:46:27,223 --> 00:46:29,020
Rigg! Rigg!

507
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:32,857
No. Get out. Get out now.

508
00:46:32,928 --> 00:46:35,123
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

509
00:46:35,197 --> 00:46:36,960
You hear me?
I will take him

510
00:46:37,033 --> 00:46:39,729
for everything he's got,
that fucking cocksucker.

511
00:46:40,836 --> 00:46:42,804
That's sweet, Ms. Tuck,

512
00:46:42,872 --> 00:46:45,773
but if you love the guy so much,
why leave him?

513
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:48,503
- He left me long before I left him.
- Okay, people break up.

514
00:46:48,577 --> 00:46:50,704
Relationships end.
It's called life.

515
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,442
I mean, he started
massacring people.

516
00:46:53,516 --> 00:46:55,984
- Gideon meant everything to him.
- Gideon? I'm sorry, who?

517
00:46:56,052 --> 00:46:59,044
Do you know anything
about the Chinese zodiac?

518
00:46:59,121 --> 00:47:01,146
Aw, Jill, no no.

519
00:47:01,223 --> 00:47:03,191
I didn't just get pregnant.

520
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:05,227
It was carefully planned.

521
00:47:05,294 --> 00:47:08,286
Everything with John was.

522
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:12,691
- Thanks.
- See you.

523
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:14,736
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. Let me get that for you.

524
00:47:14,804 --> 00:47:17,500
Thank you.

525
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:19,734
- Thanks. Have a good night.
- You too.

526
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:21,401
- Good night.
- Good night.

527
00:47:26,115 --> 00:47:28,811
Hey, honey,
you want some company?

528
00:47:28,884 --> 00:47:31,512
What are you doing?

529
00:47:31,587 --> 00:47:33,555
You know what this building is?

530
00:47:36,692 --> 00:47:38,956
It's a health clinic.

531
00:47:39,028 --> 00:47:41,929
You're a beautiful girl.
Go home.

532
00:47:48,537 --> 00:47:50,368
My jacket.
I forgot my jacket.

533
00:47:50,439 --> 00:47:52,407
- I forgot my jacket.
- Cecil, no.

534
00:47:52,475 --> 00:47:54,170
Oh, please please, Jill.
It's right there.

535
00:47:54,243 --> 00:47:57,644
Look, it's right there.
Please please. Come on.

536
00:47:58,681 --> 00:48:00,649
Thank you.

537
00:48:08,724 --> 00:48:10,692
Thanks.

538
00:48:12,528 --> 00:48:14,689
Listen to me.
I don't want to hurt you, all right?

539
00:48:14,763 --> 00:48:16,321
You're gonna open up
that fucking door.

540
00:48:16,398 --> 00:48:18,866
Open that fucking door.
Open it.

541
00:48:18,934 --> 00:48:21,232
Open it.

542
00:48:21,303 --> 00:48:24,033
Fuck!
What fucking key?

543
00:48:24,106 --> 00:48:26,233
- What key?
- That one.

544
00:48:26,308 --> 00:48:28,071
Fuck.

545
00:48:30,446 --> 00:48:32,038
Fucking stay there.

546
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:37,319
Cecil?

547
00:48:56,138 --> 00:48:59,471
Don't cry.
No no, hey, you're gonna be okay.

548
00:49:02,578 --> 00:49:04,546
Fuck.

549
00:49:17,326 --> 00:49:18,953
I need some help here.

550
00:49:19,028 --> 00:49:21,087
Orderly.

551
00:49:21,163 --> 00:49:22,892
This is my wife.
She's pregnant.

552
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:25,763
- How far along is she, sir?
- Seven months.

553
00:50:06,976 --> 00:50:09,376
All I wanted to do was help them.

554
00:50:10,646 --> 00:50:13,114
You can't help them.

555
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,218
They have to help themselves.

556
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:30,224
Okay, let's review:

557
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:32,267
Girl loves boy.
Boy loves girl.

558
00:50:32,334 --> 00:50:36,270
Boy gets girl pregnant.
Girl loses baby.

559
00:50:36,338 --> 00:50:39,535
Boy turns into a serial killer.

560
00:50:39,608 --> 00:50:42,736
Jill, I'm not buying it.

561
00:50:43,779 --> 00:50:45,906
You're gonna want
to take a look at this.

562
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:47,949
All right, she doesn't leave.

563
00:50:59,495 --> 00:51:02,259
He's been identified
as lvan Landsness.

564
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:04,356
Acquitted of rape three times.

565
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:07,459
Had to gouge out his own eyes
in order to release himself.

566
00:51:08,704 --> 00:51:11,764
How does something like this
get into a motel room undetected?

567
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,808
Piece by piece.

568
00:51:13,876 --> 00:51:15,901
The room's been rented
for the past six days

569
00:51:15,978 --> 00:51:19,277
to a lawyer named Art Blank.
Get this: He went missing two weeks ago.

570
00:51:19,348 --> 00:51:21,043
Run his name.
Get his addresses.

571
00:51:21,116 --> 00:51:24,552
Two out of five people on Officer Rigg's
apartment walls are dead.

572
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,487
Every partner
he's ever worked with... dead.

573
00:51:27,556 --> 00:51:30,855
Rigg didn't kill lvan.
Ivan made his own choice.

574
00:51:30,926 --> 00:51:32,860
Isn't that the whole Jigsaw mantra?

575
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:34,725
This wasn't about lvan.
It wasn't his test.

576
00:51:34,797 --> 00:51:37,732
It was about Rigg.

577
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,893
Look at these photos.
Tell me how you feel.

578
00:51:39,968 --> 00:51:41,765
Look at these women and tell me
how you feel.

579
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:43,828
- Angry. Enraged.
- Exactly.

580
00:51:43,906 --> 00:51:48,070
The pimp, the rapist...
Jigsaw wanted Rigg to see what he sees.

581
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:51,476
He wants him to feel what he feels.

582
00:51:51,547 --> 00:51:53,913
This wasn't about Rigg
saving his friends.

583
00:51:53,982 --> 00:51:56,746
He's being recruited.

584
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:59,788
Thanks. Art Blank's got
a bunch of properties.

585
00:51:59,855 --> 00:52:02,221
Last known address
is a couple of blocks from here.

586
00:52:08,731 --> 00:52:11,791
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

587
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,596
- Clear.
- Clear.

588
00:52:13,669 --> 00:52:15,637
Clear.

589
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:37,190
What does this mean?

590
00:52:37,259 --> 00:52:40,057
We're the two Jigsaw targets.

591
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:55,810
Fuck you.

592
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:02,917
Hey.

593
00:53:03,952 --> 00:53:06,944
Hey. Hey.

594
00:53:23,005 --> 00:53:25,803
Hey, asshole,
you jump off that block,

595
00:53:25,874 --> 00:53:27,398
you electrocute him.

596
00:53:27,476 --> 00:53:30,934
If that ice had melted more,
he'd be fried. You understand?

597
00:53:31,013 --> 00:53:32,981
Listen to him.

598
00:53:42,024 --> 00:53:44,151
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life,

599
00:53:44,226 --> 00:53:45,523
- cocksucker!
- Calm down.

600
00:53:45,594 --> 00:53:47,653
We'll get somebody to take
a look at it, all right?

601
00:53:47,729 --> 00:53:50,960
My client has a broken nose
and a fractured cheekbone.

602
00:53:51,033 --> 00:53:54,730
Administrative leave with pay
is not acceptable.

603
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:58,437
The IA investigation is underway.

604
00:53:59,842 --> 00:54:02,470
Into this precinct? Wow.
What's that gonna get me, huh?

605
00:54:02,544 --> 00:54:04,739
- The truth.
- I'll tell you what the truth is.

606
00:54:04,813 --> 00:54:07,373
The truth is,
I have an eyewitness.

607
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:10,077
The man's wife? She stands to gain
as much as he does

608
00:54:10,152 --> 00:54:12,120
if there were to be
a financial settlement,

609
00:54:12,187 --> 00:54:13,848
which is not gonna happen
because he's lying.

610
00:54:13,922 --> 00:54:15,890
He attacked Officer Rigg first.

611
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:17,926
That's according to whom?

612
00:54:17,993 --> 00:54:20,359
Me. I saw the whole thing.

613
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,623
You want to testify
before the grand jury?

614
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:26,998
I've already signed IA's affidavit.
The charges are being dismissed.

615
00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:29,299
Oh, you guys are... you're good.

616
00:54:29,371 --> 00:54:32,340
You know, you're obviously as thick
as thieves in this precinct.

617
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:34,705
But it'll come back to you.
You know that, right?

618
00:54:34,776 --> 00:54:37,472
I mean, one day someday it will.
It will come back to you.

619
00:54:45,687 --> 00:54:47,655
You understand?

620
00:54:47,723 --> 00:54:49,247
Motherfucker.

621
00:54:49,324 --> 00:54:51,554
Hey, do you understand?

622
00:54:54,663 --> 00:54:56,722
Okay.

623
00:55:01,937 --> 00:55:03,700
Motherfucker.

624
00:55:19,054 --> 00:55:21,045
You're gonna have to tell me
how you got

625
00:55:21,123 --> 00:55:24,422
those bruises on your hand
and your neck.

626
00:56:15,644 --> 00:56:17,737
Rigg! Rigg!

627
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:42,766
I did it! I won!

628
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:44,465
What the hell did you do?

629
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:46,803
L...

630
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:57,318
What's happening?

631
00:57:01,023 --> 00:57:03,685
The human body is
a fascinating organism.

632
00:57:03,759 --> 00:57:05,989
It can withstand
the most brutal injury...

633
00:57:07,029 --> 00:57:10,123
and yet repair itself miraculously.

634
00:57:10,198 --> 00:57:12,166
But you know this all too well.

635
00:57:12,234 --> 00:57:14,225
How many broken bones
have you suffered

636
00:57:14,302 --> 00:57:16,930
at the hands of your husband?

637
00:57:17,005 --> 00:57:19,735
How many flesh wounds
have you endured?

638
00:57:19,808 --> 00:57:21,070
Help!

639
00:57:21,143 --> 00:57:25,011
With time, the bruises have healed,
but your pain has not.

640
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:32,012
Today I empower you
to take control of your life.

641
00:57:32,087 --> 00:57:34,146
Can you disconnect
from the one thing

642
00:57:34,222 --> 00:57:36,986
that has brought you and others
so much pain?

643
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:39,493
With time your wounds will heal.

644
00:57:41,263 --> 00:57:43,254
His, however, will not.

645
00:57:47,736 --> 00:57:50,534
Remove the ties that bind...

646
00:57:50,605 --> 00:57:51,731
Get me out of here!

647
00:57:51,807 --> 00:57:54,037
...or bleed to death
from you inactivity.

648
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:56,077
The choice is yours.

649
00:57:56,144 --> 00:57:58,874
Okay.
Okay okay!

650
00:57:58,947 --> 00:58:00,278
Here we go.

651
00:58:04,252 --> 00:58:06,777
I'm sorry.

652
00:58:10,325 --> 00:58:13,089
Morgan, Morgan,
what the fuck are you doing?

653
00:58:45,494 --> 00:58:48,725
Help me.
Please help me. I can't do this.

654
00:58:48,797 --> 00:58:50,890
- Please help me!
- Calm down.

655
00:58:50,966 --> 00:58:53,093
No, don't go. Don't go.
Don't go. Wait for me.

656
00:58:53,168 --> 00:58:55,159
Please get me out.
Please get me out.

657
00:58:55,237 --> 00:58:57,831
Don't. Don't go. Don't leave me here.

658
00:58:57,906 --> 00:59:00,807
Help me down.

659
00:59:00,876 --> 00:59:03,845
Hello, Officer Rigg.
What have you learned thus far?

660
00:59:03,912 --> 00:59:06,244
Experience is a harsh teacher.

661
00:59:06,314 --> 00:59:08,305
First comes the test.

662
00:59:08,383 --> 00:59:11,079
Second comes the lesson.

663
00:59:11,153 --> 00:59:13,621
If you are to save as I save

664
00:59:13,688 --> 00:59:16,486
then you will see
that the person before you

665
00:59:16,558 --> 00:59:18,116
is but a student.

666
00:59:18,193 --> 00:59:20,923
So I ask you, Officer Rigg,

667
00:59:20,996 --> 00:59:22,964
has the pupil learned her lesson?

668
00:59:23,031 --> 00:59:26,467
Has she been taught
the error of her ways?

669
00:59:26,535 --> 00:59:28,230
Does she now

670
00:59:28,303 --> 00:59:30,294
- view the world differently?
- Please help.

671
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,771
Officer Rigg,
the key to this person's freedom

672
00:59:34,843 --> 00:59:37,676
lies in the palm of your hand.

673
00:59:37,746 --> 00:59:40,146
But only after she has done
her own part

674
00:59:40,215 --> 00:59:43,742
can you play your role
in her salvation.

675
00:59:43,819 --> 00:59:46,117
Once judgment has been made,
though,

676
00:59:46,188 --> 00:59:48,850
the key to finding
your next destination

677
00:59:48,924 --> 00:59:51,290
is just off the map.

678
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,453
- Who did this to you?
- I don't know.

679
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,794
Help, please.
Help, please.

680
00:59:57,866 --> 00:59:59,993
Stay still.
I'm gonna try to take this out.

681
01:00:12,214 --> 01:00:13,408
Thank you.
Thank you.

682
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:15,449
Oh, fuck.

683
01:00:16,551 --> 01:00:19,247
That's it.
"Just off the map."

684
01:00:19,321 --> 01:00:21,289
Just off the map.

685
01:00:22,557 --> 01:00:25,185
Tracy.

686
01:00:27,262 --> 01:00:28,593
"Go home."

687
01:00:31,466 --> 01:00:33,161
Where is she?

688
01:00:33,235 --> 01:00:35,931
I'm so cold. Please.

689
01:00:43,245 --> 01:00:45,213
I want to live.

690
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,118
You have to save yourself.

691
01:00:55,123 --> 01:00:56,886
Don't leave me.
Please don't leave.

692
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:58,983
Help me, please.
Don't leave.

693
01:01:03,999 --> 01:01:06,092
I want to stop playing.

694
01:01:09,905 --> 01:01:12,032
Why don't you fucking kill me?

695
01:01:12,107 --> 01:01:13,938
No.

696
01:01:16,311 --> 01:01:19,974
- Shut up!
- I don't want to play anymore.

697
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,518
"Save as I save."

698
01:01:24,586 --> 01:01:26,713
So what did he do,
free her and let him die?

699
01:01:26,788 --> 01:01:28,949
This guy didn't have a chance.
He's got rods going through

700
01:01:29,024 --> 01:01:31,720
every major artery in his body.
"Your life is in her hands."

701
01:01:31,793 --> 01:01:33,761
Rigg didn't kill this guy.
His wife did.

702
01:01:33,828 --> 01:01:36,763
She identified Officer Rigg,
said he saved her.

703
01:01:36,831 --> 01:01:38,492
- Saved?
- Yeah.

704
01:01:38,566 --> 01:01:41,126
She passed Rigg's judgment,
got fixed and got her freedom back.

705
01:01:45,473 --> 01:01:47,805
- Yeah.
- Second address?

706
01:01:50,178 --> 01:01:52,976
Really? Okay, yeah.
That's good. Good.

707
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:55,346
But I still need that address.
Text me.

708
01:01:55,417 --> 01:01:58,648
I just found out something interesting
about the three people in the traps.

709
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,121
They were all represented by a lawyer
named Art Blank.

710
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:04,420
- He got them all off?
- Yeah. But wait, it gets better.

711
01:02:04,492 --> 01:02:05,925
He's also Jill Tuck's lawyer.

712
01:02:07,295 --> 01:02:09,195
Look out!

713
01:02:13,301 --> 01:02:16,361
- The lair... where's the lair?
- Raided. It doesn't exist.

714
01:02:16,438 --> 01:02:18,998
Jigsaw wanted us to find that place.
Where's the new game being played?

715
01:02:19,074 --> 01:02:20,507
We find that place... we find Rigg.

716
01:02:20,575 --> 01:02:22,941
We got a second address.
There's a co-owner.

717
01:02:23,011 --> 01:02:24,342
- Who?
- Jill Tuck.

718
01:02:24,412 --> 01:02:27,210
- Jill Tuck? Where's the building?
- Here. This building.

719
01:03:36,384 --> 01:03:38,113
Hello, Agent Perez.

720
01:03:38,186 --> 01:03:42,020
And welcome to the world
that you have long studied.

721
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,921
Your partner Agent Strahm

722
01:03:43,992 --> 01:03:47,621
will soon take the life
of an innocent man.

723
01:03:47,695 --> 01:03:50,186
Heed my warning, Agent Perez.

724
01:03:50,265 --> 01:03:53,428
Your next move is critical.

725
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:55,469
Open the door...

726
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:00,207
What is that?

727
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,788
I got you.

728
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:19,956
Paramedics!

729
01:04:20,028 --> 01:04:21,928
Help!

730
01:04:23,298 --> 01:04:25,630
Stay with me.
Okay, come on.

731
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,668
Shallow breaths. Come on.

732
01:04:27,735 --> 01:04:29,259
Stay with me. All right.

733
01:04:29,337 --> 01:04:31,737
All right. You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

734
01:05:03,037 --> 01:05:04,868
Hey.

735
01:05:05,907 --> 01:05:07,875
Hey, you. Come here.

736
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:09,500
Look.

737
01:05:09,577 --> 01:05:12,410
Hey. Hey.

738
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,107
Come on.

739
01:05:14,182 --> 01:05:17,049
Hey. Hey.

740
01:05:18,353 --> 01:05:19,786
Fuck.

741
01:05:24,893 --> 01:05:27,054
- Stop. Stop.
- Son of a bitch!

742
01:05:27,128 --> 01:05:28,891
Fuck.

743
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,931
Stop. Fuck.

744
01:05:34,002 --> 01:05:35,799
Hey.

745
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:38,498
Listen to me. I'm not the one
you've got to worry about.

746
01:05:38,573 --> 01:05:41,371
You understand me? I'm not
the one you've got to worry about,

747
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:43,569
asshole.

748
01:05:43,645 --> 01:05:46,978
As a matter of fact,
I recommend you stay alive

749
01:05:47,048 --> 01:05:50,540
until the fucking clock
counts down.

750
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:55,621
Here's the good news:
If this other guy passes his test,

751
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:58,887
the three of us can go free.

752
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,825
Hey, look at me.

753
01:06:00,895 --> 01:06:02,726
Look at me.

754
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:05,891
If you don't stay on the block,
your partner gets electrocuted.

755
01:06:05,967 --> 01:06:08,231
Now for my final task.

756
01:06:10,205 --> 01:06:12,571
There you go.

757
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:15,608
Live or die.

758
01:06:15,677 --> 01:06:17,440
You make the choice.

759
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,214
Mrs. Perez?

760
01:06:21,282 --> 01:06:24,979
Hi. This is Peter Strahm.
I work with your daughter Lindsay.

761
01:06:25,053 --> 01:06:28,079
Yeah.
I have some bad news.

762
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,486
See that, Jill? That's a federal fucking
indictment. It's got your name on it.

763
01:07:08,563 --> 01:07:11,657
Wanna put somebody else's name on it?
You start talking to me, okay?

764
01:07:11,733 --> 01:07:13,428
What's with the doll?
What's with the tricycle?

765
01:07:13,501 --> 01:07:15,799
Who were John's business associates
before he went insane?

766
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:17,963
He wasn't the associate type.

767
01:07:19,007 --> 01:07:20,941
Where the hell is Art Blank?

768
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:23,102
Obstruction of justice.
Aiding and abetting.

769
01:07:23,177 --> 01:07:25,441
Conspirator to murder.

770
01:07:25,513 --> 01:07:26,844
Talk to me!

771
01:07:26,914 --> 01:07:29,940
In 15 minutes, more people
are gonna die, Jill... police officers.

772
01:07:30,018 --> 01:07:31,781
He's a business partner.
He's a friend.

773
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:34,048
He's the accomplice
we have been looking for

774
01:07:34,122 --> 01:07:35,851
and he is your fucking lawyer.

775
01:07:38,126 --> 01:07:41,220
You see this?
This is my partner's blood.

776
01:07:41,296 --> 01:07:43,662
She's fighting for her life right now

777
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:46,825
because of your lunatic husband.

778
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:49,631
What happened between Jigsaw
and Art Blank?

779
01:07:49,704 --> 01:07:51,672
John?

780
01:07:53,941 --> 01:07:55,909
John.

781
01:07:57,478 --> 01:07:59,446
I guess he's not here either.

782
01:07:59,514 --> 01:08:02,881
What the fuck is this place, Jill?

783
01:08:08,656 --> 01:08:10,851
- Don't be mad.
- What?

784
01:08:14,495 --> 01:08:17,020
Hey, are you all right?

785
01:08:17,098 --> 01:08:20,966
You weren't returning
my calls, buddy.

786
01:08:21,035 --> 01:08:24,835
Listen, John, l...

787
01:08:24,906 --> 01:08:26,874
I'm sorry.
I understand.

788
01:08:26,941 --> 01:08:29,842
What happened was a tragedy.

789
01:08:29,911 --> 01:08:32,539
But I gotta tell you...

790
01:08:32,613 --> 01:08:35,047
listen, John, I gotta tell you,
those buildings we're working on...

791
01:08:35,116 --> 01:08:37,084
You take 'em.
You give my share to Jill.

792
01:08:37,151 --> 01:08:40,211
That's not the way it works, John.
You see, we're partners.

793
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:42,722
Your designs will make
those buildings special.

794
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:45,258
We've got 40 families ready to move in...
40 families, John,

795
01:08:45,326 --> 01:08:47,521
low-income families.

796
01:08:47,595 --> 01:08:49,324
You can't just walk away.

797
01:08:49,397 --> 01:08:51,365
You're their savior, John.

798
01:08:51,432 --> 01:08:53,491
Get the fuck out of here.

799
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:55,763
Who are you talking to like that?
It's me, John.

800
01:08:55,837 --> 01:08:58,567
- Did you hear what I said?
- Oh, I heard you, John.

801
01:09:02,043 --> 01:09:04,011
Get the fuck...

802
01:09:06,013 --> 01:09:07,674
You heard me.

803
01:09:10,518 --> 01:09:14,215
Okay, John.
You take good care of yourself.

804
01:09:15,757 --> 01:09:18,282
Gimme a call
when you're feeling better.

805
01:09:37,111 --> 01:09:39,045
He blamed me.

806
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:41,707
I don't think he could
ever forgive me.

807
01:09:41,783 --> 01:09:44,251
In his mind
our time was over.

808
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,886
He was diagnosed with cancer
soon after that.

809
01:09:58,332 --> 01:10:00,664
Did you try to contact him again?

810
01:10:00,735 --> 01:10:02,430
I tried.

811
01:10:03,638 --> 01:10:06,106
But a different person
crawled out of the wreckage.

812
01:10:06,174 --> 01:10:08,506
Someone else survived.

813
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,872
- I asked you not to come here.
- I need to talk to you.

814
01:10:41,943 --> 01:10:43,911
John, John,

815
01:10:43,978 --> 01:10:47,175
look at this.
What is this, hmm?

816
01:10:47,248 --> 01:10:49,216
Why do you have Cecil's picture?

817
01:10:49,283 --> 01:10:51,251
What have you done to him?

818
01:10:51,319 --> 01:10:55,847
I told him not to take life
for granted.

819
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:57,891
I want to play a game.

820
01:10:57,959 --> 01:11:00,985
Your life is a lie.

821
01:11:01,062 --> 01:11:03,030
Now comes your moment of truth.

822
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:05,065
As a drug user and a hustler,

823
01:11:05,132 --> 01:11:08,465
you've played roulette
with other people's lives.

824
01:11:08,536 --> 01:11:10,731
Today you play with your own.

825
01:12:14,502 --> 01:12:16,470
Fuck.

826
01:12:21,275 --> 01:12:23,300
Fuck!

827
01:12:28,616 --> 01:12:30,584
Hey, it's you.

828
01:12:30,651 --> 01:12:32,209
You did this to me.

829
01:12:32,286 --> 01:12:35,255
No, you did this to yourself.

830
01:12:36,657 --> 01:12:39,023
Your greed took the life
of an innocent child.

831
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:42,119
Could you give me time
to explain, please?

832
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:44,790
I can't give you time.
No one can.

833
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:46,355
Time's an illusion.

834
01:12:46,434 --> 01:12:49,665
Look, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

835
01:12:49,737 --> 01:12:51,762
I forgive you, Cecil. I do.

836
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:53,636
Addiction has ruined your life.

837
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:55,403
I'm bleeding, man.

838
01:12:55,476 --> 01:12:57,944
Please just let me go.

839
01:12:58,012 --> 01:13:00,139
I could let you go.

840
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:03,115
That wouldn't serve you.

841
01:13:03,184 --> 01:13:07,211
I'll tell you what I will do, though.
I'll give you a tool

842
01:13:07,288 --> 01:13:10,257
to reclaim your life,

843
01:13:10,324 --> 01:13:13,521
to discard the vices that have
so corrupted your soul.

844
01:13:13,594 --> 01:13:15,562
I don't have a fucking soul.

845
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:17,621
Maybe you will in the next life, Cecil.

846
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:19,996
You see, things aren't sequential.

847
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:22,695
Good doesn't lead to good,
nor bad to bad.

848
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:24,465
People steal,
don't get caught,

849
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:26,506
live the good life.

850
01:13:26,574 --> 01:13:28,633
Others lie, cheat

851
01:13:28,709 --> 01:13:30,643
and get elected.

852
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:33,339
Some people stop
to help a stranded motorist

853
01:13:33,414 --> 01:13:37,111
and get taken out
by a speeding semi.

854
01:13:37,184 --> 01:13:39,550
There's no accounting for it.

855
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:42,885
How you play the cards you're dealt...
that's all that matters.

856
01:13:42,957 --> 01:13:45,289
Look at me.

857
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:47,190
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

858
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:49,923
Oh, yeah.

859
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:52,124
I understand.

860
01:13:53,467 --> 01:13:55,367
You're fucking nuts!

861
01:14:08,849 --> 01:14:11,875
Whoa! What the fuck is that?

862
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,083
It's the tool...

863
01:14:15,156 --> 01:14:17,056
the tool that's going to
save your life.

864
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:19,951
I want to play a game.

865
01:14:21,262 --> 01:14:23,787
Your life is a lie, Cecil.

866
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:27,095
Now comes your moment of truth.

867
01:14:27,168 --> 01:14:30,103
As a drug addict and a thief,

868
01:14:30,171 --> 01:14:32,332
you've preyed on the kindness
of others

869
01:14:32,406 --> 01:14:34,397
to fuel your addiction.

870
01:14:34,475 --> 01:14:36,807
Today we're bringing

871
01:14:36,877 --> 01:14:39,471
the ugliness inside you
out into the open.

872
01:14:39,547 --> 01:14:41,674
Now in order for you
to stay alive

873
01:14:41,749 --> 01:14:44,217
we have to match your face

874
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:47,083
with the ugliness of your soul.

875
01:14:48,456 --> 01:14:52,756
Just lean forward into the knives
with your face.

876
01:14:52,827 --> 01:14:55,057
Press hard enough

877
01:14:55,129 --> 01:14:58,155
and you'll release
the arm and the leg restraints

878
01:14:58,232 --> 01:15:00,666
that bind you.

879
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,726
Press hard, though.

880
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:05,900
And you'll be free.

881
01:15:05,973 --> 01:15:08,703
You sick fuck! Fuck you!

882
01:15:08,776 --> 01:15:13,713
Or you can sit idly
and bleed out on the floor.

883
01:15:14,749 --> 01:15:17,047
Live or die, Cecil.

884
01:15:17,118 --> 01:15:19,086
Make your choice.

885
01:15:28,996 --> 01:15:31,328
Fuck you, you sick fuck!

886
01:15:31,398 --> 01:15:32,956
Help!

887
01:16:24,752 --> 01:16:26,151
You're dead.

888
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:28,848
You're fucking dead.

889
01:16:30,357 --> 01:16:32,484
Fucking dead.

890
01:16:46,073 --> 01:16:48,041
What's happened to you?

891
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:53,079
What's happened to me?

892
01:16:53,147 --> 01:16:54,978
What's happened
to me?

893
01:17:03,591 --> 01:17:05,616
Now you don't come back.

894
01:17:07,194 --> 01:17:09,424
You do it for yourself
if you can't do it for me.

895
01:17:10,931 --> 01:17:12,899
I lost him too.

896
01:17:48,736 --> 01:17:51,136
"Four Walls Build a Home."

897
01:17:59,446 --> 01:18:01,710
Your son was named
after John's first building, right?

898
01:18:01,782 --> 01:18:04,080
- Yes.
- Where is it?

899
01:18:04,151 --> 01:18:06,711
Where is it?
Where is it?

900
01:18:06,787 --> 01:18:09,347
Where is it?

901
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,534
What the fuck does that mean?

902
01:19:25,099 --> 01:19:29,160
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

903
01:19:32,539 --> 01:19:34,700
You'd better hope he doesn't
come through that door.

904
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:37,869
Who? Who's coming
through the door?

905
01:19:42,383 --> 01:19:44,783
Who is it?

906
01:20:17,651 --> 01:20:19,949
Where the fuck are you?

907
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:23,683
Gideon Meat Packing,
11235 Blake Drive.

908
01:20:23,757 --> 01:20:25,725
I don't have two minutes.

909
01:21:27,221 --> 01:21:29,655
Who's coming through the door?

910
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:43,036
Fuck.

911
01:22:02,523 --> 01:22:04,616
Congratulations, Art.

912
01:22:38,492 --> 01:22:40,756
Who is it?

913
01:22:43,764 --> 01:22:46,255
Who's coming through the door?

914
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:48,893
Here he comes.

915
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:50,095
Who the fuck is it?

916
01:22:51,605 --> 01:22:54,438
Shit.

917
01:22:57,444 --> 01:22:59,241
Shit.

918
01:23:01,215 --> 01:23:03,615
Fix me, motherfucker!

919
01:23:06,053 --> 01:23:08,886
I'm standing right here.

920
01:23:10,157 --> 01:23:12,648
Your time's running out.

921
01:23:12,726 --> 01:23:14,751
Please think about
what you're doing.

922
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:22,158
Think about
what you promised me.

923
01:23:22,236 --> 01:23:23,703
Think about tomorrow.

924
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:25,738
Lynn?

925
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:30,510
Lynn! Lynn!

926
01:23:39,453 --> 01:23:41,421
Who is it?

927
01:23:50,897 --> 01:23:53,024
What is that?

928
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:56,092
This will release us
when the timer's up.

929
01:24:00,507 --> 01:24:02,873
Release me!

930
01:24:07,614 --> 01:24:09,582
Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

931
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:11,618
Live or die, Jeff.

932
01:24:11,685 --> 01:24:13,778
You've got a choice.

933
01:24:13,854 --> 01:24:15,549
I forgive you.

934
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:18,558
Jeff.

935
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:20,593
Jeff!

936
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:26,798
- Eric!
- Don't open the door!

937
01:24:26,867 --> 01:24:28,732
What the fuck?

938
01:24:31,004 --> 01:24:32,232
Shit.

939
01:25:12,379 --> 01:25:14,677
"Open the door and you will find me."

940
01:25:26,626 --> 01:25:29,424
- Let me see your fucking hands.
- Where is my daughter, you mother...?

941
01:25:31,798 --> 01:25:32,958
Fuck.

942
01:25:41,308 --> 01:25:43,435
Jesus.

943
01:25:54,588 --> 01:25:57,580
- Fuck!
- Aw, you stupid motherfucker.

944
01:25:57,657 --> 01:25:59,682
- What did you do?
- I had more time.

945
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,389
- I still had fucking time.
- Why did you open that door?

946
01:26:03,463 --> 01:26:05,158
- You fucking did this!
- No, you idiot.

947
01:26:05,232 --> 01:26:09,293
No, Jigsaw's testing you,
you fucking piece of shit.

948
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:11,963
Put your fucking hands
where I can see them!

949
01:26:12,038 --> 01:26:14,302
- Jigsaw's fucking testing you.
- Don't fucking move!

950
01:26:18,245 --> 01:26:20,042
Hello, Officer Rigg.

951
01:26:20,113 --> 01:26:22,741
If you are hearing this,
then you have reached

952
01:26:22,816 --> 01:26:25,614
Detective Matthews
and Detective Hoffman

953
01:26:25,685 --> 01:26:28,153
in under 90 minutes,

954
01:26:28,221 --> 01:26:30,314
resulting in their deaths.

955
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:32,585
The rules were clear.

956
01:26:32,659 --> 01:26:34,524
You were warned.

957
01:26:34,594 --> 01:26:36,323
- It's Kerry!
- Do not go through that door.

958
01:26:36,396 --> 01:26:39,331
You know never to go
through an unsecured door, ever.

959
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,832
Tonight you face your obsession.

960
01:26:42,903 --> 01:26:45,667
What you can't do
is save everyone.

961
01:26:45,739 --> 01:26:47,764
Will you learn how to let go?

962
01:26:48,809 --> 01:26:51,369
- Eric is still out there, man.
- It's time to let go.

963
01:26:51,445 --> 01:26:53,913
Detective Matthews has
but 90 minutes.

964
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:56,244
I recommend you stay alive

965
01:26:56,316 --> 01:26:58,409
until the fucking clock
counts down.

966
01:26:58,485 --> 01:27:00,476
They had to save themselves.

967
01:27:01,521 --> 01:27:03,318
Take 'em.

968
01:27:05,459 --> 01:27:09,088
Their salvation was
out of your hands.

969
01:27:09,162 --> 01:27:11,130
Time was on your side,

970
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:13,894
but your obsession
wouldn't let you wait.

971
01:27:13,967 --> 01:27:16,834
Instead of saving
Detective Matthews,

972
01:27:16,903 --> 01:27:18,871
you cost him his life.

973
01:27:18,939 --> 01:27:21,066
You failed your final test.

974
01:27:28,815 --> 01:27:31,841
What I don't understand is
how the hell could Jigsaw do all this?

975
01:27:31,918 --> 01:27:33,852
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

976
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,888
I'm not so sure he did.

977
01:27:42,562 --> 01:27:44,826
- This wasn't done by Amanda Young.
- Excuse me?

978
01:27:44,898 --> 01:27:46,889
- She couldn't get her up there alone.
- John Kramer was...

979
01:27:46,967 --> 01:27:48,696
He's brains, not brawn.

980
01:27:48,768 --> 01:27:51,703
We're here to find the person
helping Jigsaw and Amanda Young.

981
01:28:01,948 --> 01:28:04,178
Looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital.

982
01:28:08,255 --> 01:28:09,517
You go home.

983
01:28:12,526 --> 01:28:14,118
We chose this.

984
01:28:31,411 --> 01:28:33,379
Game over.

985
01:29:01,408 --> 01:29:03,740
You feel you now have control,
don't you?

986
01:29:05,845 --> 01:29:08,439
You think you will
walk away untested?

987
01:29:15,789 --> 01:29:19,225
I promise that my work
will continue.

988
01:29:19,292 --> 01:29:22,420
That I have ensured.

989
01:29:22,495 --> 01:29:24,827
By hearing this tape
some will assume

990
01:29:24,898 --> 01:29:26,695
that this is over.

991
01:29:26,766 --> 01:29:30,099
But I am still among you.

992
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:33,435
You think it's over
just because I am dead?

993
01:29:33,506 --> 01:29:37,306
It's not over.
The games have just begun.
