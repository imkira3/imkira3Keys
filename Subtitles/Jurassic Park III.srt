1
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,657
Better hurry.

2
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,587
Here you go, my friend.

3
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,173
Make sure you get us
as close as you can!

4
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,593
I'll give you something extra
if you make it a good trip.

5
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,053
Hey, I'm going to get
you close, my friend,

6
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,598
but not too close, eh?
You don't want to be eaten.

7
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,392
Ready, amigo?

8
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,769
Ready!

9
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,693
One, two, three!

10
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,287
Eric, heave!

11
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,135
Scared?

12
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,054
Uh-uh. This is great.

13
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,652
See anything yet?

14
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,570
No, not yet.

15
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,602
What was that?
I don't know.

16
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,525
- Hold on!
- What's happening?

17
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,776
Just hold on!

18
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,863
Make it stop!

19
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,369
What happened to them?

20
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,540
- I don't know.
- Oh, my God.

21
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,209
We're going to crash!
No, we're not.

22
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,462
I'm going to
cut this loose!

23
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,548
Let go of the rope!
We're gonna crash!

24
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,634
Move your hands!

25
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,970
Come on!

26
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,266
Here we go!

27
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,320
It's going be okay, bud.

28
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,425
Charlie, those
are herbivores.

29
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,552
They wouldn't
fight each other.

30
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,931
But these are carnivores, and they
really like fighting each other.

31
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,935
They use their teeth and their claws
to rip each other's throats out.

32
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,688
Alan, he's three.
Let's wait till he's five.

33
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,566
Right.
Sorry, Charlie.

34
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,276
- Ellie?
- Yeah?

35
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,196
It's Tom. He says he has to talk
to you about the last chapter.

36
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,448
Tell him I won't lose
the Jack Horner quote.

37
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,784
My editor thinks
he's a paleontologist.

38
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,953
Hey, Mark!

39
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,538
Hey, babe,
look who's here.

40
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,708
This is Alan.

41
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,544
Nice to meet you, Alan.

42
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,298
Daddy, this is a herbivore
and that's the dinosaur man.

43
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,175
Dinosaur man?

44
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,845
Jack, say my name.
Is my name Alan?

45
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,181
Is my name Alan?

46
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,936
He used to know me.

47
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,565
It's sad, huh?
Here you go.

48
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,236
Thanks. Mark's been working
for the State Department now.

49
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,571
What do they do, Mark?

50
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,199
International relations, mostly
treaty law, things like that.

51
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,576
Uh-oh!

52
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,537
Call of the wild one.
Here, I'll go.

53
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,249
You guys catch up.

54
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,917
Thanks, babe.

55
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,754
He's a great guy.

56
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,590
So, what are you
working on now?

57
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,175
Raptors, mostly.

58
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,511
My favorite.

59
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,847
Do you remember
the sounds they made?

60
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,516
I try not to.

61
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,394
All our theories
about raptor intelligence,

62
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,313
what they were capable of,
we weren't even close.

63
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,523
Tell me.

64
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,358
We did cranial scans
of a fossil skull

65
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:02,695
and found what looks to be a very
sophisticated resonating chamber.

66
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,864
Wait a second.
So we were right.

67
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,449
They'd the ability
to vocalize.

68
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,534
It's the key to
their social intelligence.

69
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,786
Which explains why they
could work as a team.

70
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,621
They'd coordinate
attacks so their prey

71
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,373
wouldn't know
what was going on.

72
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,875
They could
talk to each other.

73
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,085
To a degree
we never imagined.

74
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,713
Ellie, they were smart.

75
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,632
They were smarter
than dolphins or whales.

76
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,719
They were
smarter than primates.

77
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:36,645
I just wanted to say, if you ever need
help, sometimes you forget to ask.

78
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,108
So you can call me.
Anything, anytime.

79
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,235
Sure.

80
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,325
You're still the best.

81
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,577
I mean that.

82
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,830
The last of my breed.

83
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:07,551
It is through the study of the
anterior chamber in multiple specimens

84
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,762
that we can
determine the correlation

85
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,264
between the upper
palate and the larynx.

86
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,476
This lets us theorize,
theorize, mind you,

87
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,730
that the raptor was capable of
sophisticated vocalizations

88
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,983
which would have been a tremendous
evolutionary advantage.

89
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:27,530
Raptors were fierce, intelligent
and socially sophisticated.

90
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:31,367
They were able to hunt in numbers
and coordinate their efforts.

91
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,579
Were it not for the cataclysmic
events which overtook them,

92
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,916
it's entirely possible that
raptors, rather than humans,

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,461
would have become the dominant
species on this planet.

94
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,131
I hope this has
been of interest.

95
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,384
It certainly excites
us as paleontologists.

96
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,470
There is much
more to discover.

97
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:56,016
That is why we continue to need,
and ask for, your support.

98
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,064
Thank you.

99
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,118
Thank you very much,
Dr. Grant.

100
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,745
Now, does anyone
have a question?

101
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,666
Fine.

102
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,128
Does anyone have a question that
does not relate to Jurassic Park?

103
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,091
Or the incident
in San Diego

104
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,760
which I did not witness?

105
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,598
Yes, sir?

106
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,684
Your theory on raptors
is good and all,

107
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,061
but isn't all this
conjecture kind of moot?

108
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:45,524
Once the U.N. and Costa Rica and everyone
decide how to handle that second island,

109
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,402
scientists will just go in
and look for themselves.

110
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,072
Dinosaurs lived
65 million years ago.

111
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:56,327
What is left of them is
fossilized in the rocks.

112
00:08:56,411 --> 00:09:00,873
And it is in the rock that real
scientists make real discoveries.

113
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,460
What John Hammond and
InGen did at Jurassic Park

114
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,380
is create genetically
engineered theme-park monsters.

115
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,050
Nothing more
and nothing less.

116
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,386
Are you saying you wouldn't
want to get onto Isla Sorna

117
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,014
and study them if
you had the chance?

118
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,602
No force on Earth or Heaven
could get me on that island.

119
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,783
What we got here, Nashy?

120
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,702
Einhorn 20-millimeter,
gas-operated semi-automatic.

121
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,748
10-shot, magazine fed, rotating
bolt recoil-reducing muzzle brake.

122
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,500
High explosive...

123
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,384
Udesky.

124
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,552
- It's Paul Kirby.
- Just checking...

125
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,722
Yes, sir.
We're good to go here.

126
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,016
Matter of fact,
I can lock things down

127
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,310
just as soon as you
drop me that payment.

128
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:11,193
Well, that's right, two of the very
best men I could possibly find.

129
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,447
No, sir, I haven't worked
with them personally,

130
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,702
but believe me, sir, both of these
men come very highly recommended.

131
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,169
Are you all right?

132
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,879
Nothing to worry
about, sir.

133
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,549
It's gonna be
a walk in the park.

134
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,394
Billy, I don't think
I'm doing this right.

135
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,946
Let's try the toothbrush.

136
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,950
You've got to go slowly.

137
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,662
Just take
a little bit at a time.

138
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,749
I can never tell what's
rock and what's bone.

139
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,792
Technically,
it's all rock.

140
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,212
The calcium in the bones is
replaced during fossilization.

141
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,090
But you can feel
the difference. See?

142
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,259
Rough,

143
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,470
smooth.

144
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,097
Rough, smooth.

145
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,647
Dr. Grant.

146
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,775
Mr. Brennan.

147
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,194
So, how did it go?

148
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,239
Well, it's not too late to
change your major, Billy.

149
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,617
That good, huh?
Worse.

150
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,285
We'll have to
pack up in four weeks.

151
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,745
Three.

152
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,955
I had to rent
some equipment.

153
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,208
Come here.
I got to show you something.

154
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,793
You like
computers, right?

155
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,461
I like the abacus, Billy.

156
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,255
Meet the future
of paleontology.

157
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,633
It's a rapid prototyper.

158
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,761
I enter in the scanned data
from the raptor skull.

159
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,514
The computer breaks it down
into thousands of slices.

160
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:07,476
And this thing sculpts it,
one layer at a time.

161
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:09,978
It's done.

162
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,991
I give you the resonating
chamber of a Velociraptor.

163
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,202
Listen to this.

164
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,048
Wow.

165
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,009
This is brilliant, Billy.
Really, it is.

166
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,679
Sad to say, it's just
a little bit late.

167
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:47,683
Dr. Grant? Paul Kirby,
Kirby Enterprises.

168
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,811
My card.
How you doing, Billy?

169
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,857
What can I do for you,
Mr. Kirby?

170
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,069
First thing,
I'm a great admirer of yours.

171
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,239
And I have a proposition
I'd like to discuss with you.

172
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,783
Would you have dinner with
my wife and me this evening?

173
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,118
It'll be our treat.

174
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,578
That'd be great but

175
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,873
I'm tired, I've been traveling.
Maybe some other time.

176
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,417
Believe me, this will
be worth your while.

177
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,585
We'd love to.

178
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,087
Oh, terrific!
That's the spirit. Good.

179
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,714
This evening then.

180
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,433
Billy,
thank you for coming.

181
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,642
Dr. Grant,
how are you?

182
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,687
Amanda, this is
Billy and Dr. Grant.

183
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,980
Mrs. Kirby,
how are you?

184
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,565
What are you
boys drinking?

185
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,569
Ice Pick, Catfish.
Two, please, Cat.

186
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,905
We've admired
your work for years.

187
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,740
Really.
Truly inspiring.

188
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,117
Amanda and I just
love the outdoors.

189
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,412
We've been on nearly every adventure
tour they can come up with:

190
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,665
The Nile, Galápagos, K2.

191
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,503
We even have two seats reserved on the
first commercial flight to the moon.

192
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,922
For our wedding
anniversary this year,

193
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,965
we wanted to do
something really special.

194
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,468
Something...
Once in a lifetime.

195
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,055
I've chartered an airplane
to fly us over Isla Sorna.

196
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,474
And we'd like you
to be our guide.

197
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,144
There you go, guys.

198
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,733
That's a very kind offer, Mr.
Kirby, but I'm a very, very busy man.

199
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,070
I can recommend a couple of guys
who are really highly qualified...

200
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,031
No, no.
You're the best.

201
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,741
You've seen these
animals in the flesh.

202
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,826
There's no one
who comes close to you.

203
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,248
You wouldn't be able to fly low enough
to see anything of any real interest.

204
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,583
See, that's the
interesting part,

205
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,044
because we have
permission to fly low.

206
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,295
How low?

207
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,758
I'm no aviation expert, but a heck
of a lot lower than anybody else.

208
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,385
From what I understand,

209
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,637
it's pretty much
whatever we want.

210
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,014
That's hard to believe.

211
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,058
Through my
business dealings,

212
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,018
import-export,
emerging markets,

213
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,187
I've made a lot of
friends in high places.

214
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:00,023
In this case,
the Costa Rican government.

215
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,651
Dr. Grant,
you have no idea

216
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,279
how important it is
that you come along.

217
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,655
It would make
all the difference.

218
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,781
Mrs. Kirby, I...

219
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,575
And, of course,
we'd love to make

220
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,660
a contribution to
your research here.

221
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,704
So,

222
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,001
I could write all kinds of numbers
on this check, Dr. Grant.

223
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,836
Tell me,

224
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,257
what's it gonna take?

225
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,399
Even with what I pay you,
couldn't you afford a better bag?

226
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,692
No way.

227
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,694
This one's lucky.

228
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,906
Couple of years ago, some
buddies and I went hang gliding

229
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,992
off these cliffs
in New Zealand.

230
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:56,997
And this big updraft came and swept
me right against the side. Wham!

231
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,124
That does sound lucky.

232
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,336
It was this strap alone
that saved my life.

233
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,880
Got hooked on a rock
as I was falling.

234
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,717
Reverse Darwinism.
Survival of the most idiotic.

235
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,723
Alan, I want to thank you
for bringing me along.

236
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,892
The bones will still
be there when we get back.

237
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,478
That's the great thing about bones.
They never run away.

238
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,358
And truth is,
you got me into this.

239
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:29,404
And I have no intention of being
on my own with these people.

240
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,326
Don't get too excited.

241
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,244
Chances are,
we won't see a thing.

242
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,914
Your turn to be nice.

243
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,999
Wake me when we get there.

244
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,759
So how do you
know the Kirbys?

245
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,595
Through our church.

246
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,700
Alan.

247
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,785
- Alan!

248
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,288
Wake up.
We're almost there.

249
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,390
Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
Sorna, this is San Juan Approach.

250
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,642
You're flying in
restricted airspace.

251
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,936
Immediately turn
to coordinates two...

252
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,197
My God,
I had forgotten.

253
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,128
We did it, honey.
We're here.

254
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,799
Cooper!
If you see anything, yell up!

255
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,634
No, I thought
I'd keep it to myself.

256
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,762
I'm sorry. Everyone, if you
look out the left of the plane,

257
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,556
you can see a whole
herd of Brachiosaurus.

258
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,185
In fact, you can see at the front of the
group the alpha male grazing there.

259
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,313
Udesky? Nash? How about up front?
You guys see anything?

260
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,815
Nothing yet, Mr. Kirby.

261
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,819
Mrs. Kirby, look!
Out here, you'll see a group of...

262
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,072
Mr. Kirby, we have a landing strip.
You want me to put her down?

263
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,325
No! I told you, I want to circle
first, see the whole island.

264
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,202
What do you mean?
You can't land!

265
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,329
Hold on.
I can explain...

266
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,414
You cannot land on
this island!

267
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,750
It will be fine.
Don't worry, please.

268
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,961
- Are you crazy?
- Sit down!

269
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,256
Will you please sit down?

270
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,519
Billy, tell me
we didn't land.

271
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,938
Eric!

272
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,233
Ben!

273
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,610
I think they're
looking for someone.

274
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,780
Ben!

275
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,623
Dr. Grant,
are you all right?

276
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,125
I'm sorry
we had to be so rough.

277
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,793
Who hit me?

278
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,129
That would be Cooper.

279
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,006
What are they doing?

280
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,383
Setting up a perimeter
to make the place safe.

281
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,553
Trust me, on this island,
there's no such thing as safe!

282
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,513
We have to get
back on that plane!

283
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,517
Tell your wife to stop making that noise!
That is a very, very bad idea!

284
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,895
Amanda!
Ben!

285
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,440
Honey, Dr. Grant
said that's a bad idea.

286
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,941
What?

287
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,736
He says
it's a bad idea!

288
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,071
What's a bad idea?

289
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,700
What was that?

290
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,161
That's a Tyrannosaurus.

291
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,164
I don't think so.
It sounds bigger.

292
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,670
We have to leave!
We have to leave now!

293
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,173
- Get on the plane!
- What's going on?

294
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,675
Get on the plane!

295
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,513
What about the other guy?

296
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,932
Cooper's a professional.

297
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,642
He can handle himself.

298
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,144
Get on the plane! Hurry!

299
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,771
It's all right.

300
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,534
Paul, we can't...
It's all right.

301
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,786
We'll circle the island.

302
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,663
Give me a hand, Udesky!

303
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,350
Stop!
What are you doing?

304
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,810
That's Cooper!

305
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,604
Stop.

306
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,523
Come on,
get out of the way!

307
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,067
You know
I can't stop this plane.

308
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,862
Oh, my God!

309
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,908
- Fuel cut-off!
- We're going down!

310
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,227
You okay?

311
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,938
We're okay up here.

312
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,399
Everyone, just stay put.

313
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,985
San Juan Approach.
Mayday, mayday!

314
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,778
Who has the
satellite phone?

315
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,656
I do. I got it right here.

316
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:49,409
I'm not getting anything.
The radio's gone.

317
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,627
We haven't landed yet.

318
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,759
- All circuits are busy.
- Damn it! Oh, man.

319
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,262
What was that?

320
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,850
- Keep still!
- Keep still!

321
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,227
Relax. What is it? What?

322
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,356
- What is it?
- Hold it!

323
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,651
Hang on, everyone!

324
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,548
Help me!

325
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,902
Mrs. Kirby,
come back!

326
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,696
No!

327
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,489
Amanda!

328
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,204
Follow me! This way!

329
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,047
In here!

330
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,500
I think we lost him.

331
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,173
It's okay, it's dead.

332
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,844
Nobody move a muscle.

333
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,033
No, no!
Please, don't!

334
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,868
Stop, please.

335
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,788
It's time you did some
explaining, Mr. Kirby.

336
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,125
We called everyone.
We did everything we could.

337
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,335
No one would help us.

338
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,004
The Costa Rican government
said this is a no-fly zone.

339
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,507
The U.S. Embassy,
that's our U.S. Embassy,

340
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,719
told us we should accept the inevitable.
Can you believe that?

341
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,804
You let a 12-year-old
go parasailing alone?

342
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:02,889
No!

343
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,682
He wasn't alone.
He was with a friend.

344
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,559
Ben Hildebrand.

345
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,978
Paul and I divorced
over a year ago.

346
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,772
All right, why me?

347
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,483
He said we needed someone who'd
been on the island before.

348
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,736
Yes, but I did not tell
you to kidnap somebody.

349
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,781
I have never
been on this island.

350
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,241
Sure you have.
You wrote that book.

351
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:26,788
That was Isla Nublar.
This is Isla Sorna, Site B.

352
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,956
You mean there are two
islands with dinosaurs?

353
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,375
Stay out of this.

354
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,001
How long have
they been missing?

355
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,378
Eight weeks.

356
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,046
Almost eight weeks now.

357
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:40,676
Billy. We'll go back to the
plane, salvage what we can.

358
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,053
Then we make for the coast.

359
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,723
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving
this island without our son.

360
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,267
Then you can go
and look for him.

361
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,187
Or you can stick with us, as
long as you don't hold us up.

362
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,522
Either way,

363
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,983
you probably won't
get off this island alive.

364
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,747
So? What do we do?

365
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,917
We search for your son

366
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,171
in the direction
that they're going.

367
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:19,924
Excellent.

368
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,034
Sorry.

369
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,580
It's nothing you
haven't seen before, Paul.

370
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,834
How much weight
did you say you lost?

371
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,837
About 25 pounds.
I've been swimming.

372
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,883
Swimming? You hate to swim.
You don't even know how to swim.

373
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,801
I know. I learned.

374
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,887
You look good.

375
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,096
So do you.

376
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,019
How would you
classify it, Billy?

377
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,395
Well...

378
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,148
it's a super-predator.

379
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,985
A Suchomimus.

380
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,905
That snout.
No, think bigger.

381
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,491
Baryonyx?
Not with that sail.

382
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,203
Spinosaurus aegypticus.

383
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,500
I don't remember
that on InGen's list.

384
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,959
Because it wasn't
on their list.

385
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,962
And it makes you wonder
what else they were up to.

386
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,601
So, Mr. Kirby, tell me.

387
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:58,231
When you climbed K2, did you base
camp at 25,000 or 30,000 feet?

388
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,902
30,000 feet. We were
pretty close to the top.

389
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,696
You were about 1,000
feet above it, actually.

390
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,116
No, that's
a common mistake.

391
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,621
There's no such thing as
Kirby Enterprises, is there?

392
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,832
It's Kirby Paint and
Tile Plus.

393
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,126
The "Plus" stands
for bathroom fixtures.

394
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,046
We're in the Westgate Shopping
Center, Enid, Oklahoma...

395
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,549
I don't suppose that check
you wrote us is any good.

396
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,884
I will pay you
the money I owe you.

397
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,553
This is good.

398
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,099
Here we are, in the worst place in
the world, and we're not being paid!

399
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:37,270
Wait, fellas. Hold on!
I'll make this up to you.

400
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,273
If you ever do a
bathroom or a kitchen...

401
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,234
You're not really
a mercenary, are you?

402
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,735
I never said I was.

403
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,071
That's true.
What are you?

404
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:52,201
I'm like a booking agent.
One of the guys got sick and couldn't come.

405
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,412
Excuse me. Here.

406
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,165
So you run a hardware store?
Paint and tile, yeah.

407
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,668
You never can tell
about people, can you?

408
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,295
Ain't that the truth?

409
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,964
Eric!
Quiet.

410
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,340
Would you stop that?

411
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,801
Dr. Grant says this is
very dangerous territory.

412
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,346
Maybe we should split up.
We could cover twice as much.

413
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,015
Dr. Grant says
that's a bad idea.

414
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,600
Dr. Grant says this...

415
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,394
Why hire an expert if we
don't use his advice?

416
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,272
Except Dr. Grant
isn't looking for Eric.

417
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,607
He's looking
for the coast.

418
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,941
Go ahead and scream.

419
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:27,153
When that "Tricycloplots" attacks
you, don't come crying to me.

420
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,279
Don't worry about that.

421
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,489
What? What did you say?

422
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,116
What did you say?

423
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,618
Never mind!
Paul, just drop it!

424
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,871
If we split up, I'm
going with you guys.

425
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,967
Eric!

426
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,428
Mrs. Kirby!

427
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,767
Mrs. Kirby, the chances are remote
they're still in the vicinity.

428
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,608
Young adult.

429
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,153
Hey, guys!

430
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,244
That's my camera.

431
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,209
The battery's dead.

432
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,211
I've got an idea.

433
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,755
Let me have the camera.

434
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,843
Where were you
on that one, Ma?

435
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,222
Okay, dive. Dive.

436
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,975
Come on, Ma.

437
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,102
Eric.

438
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,687
Ma, you were
supposed to catch it!

439
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,815
I shot this the morning
they disappeared.

440
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,818
No, I want that.
Let me take that.

441
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,112
Come on, give me that.
Come on, baby.

442
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:55,032
- See anything yet?
- No, not yet!

443
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,660
What was that?

444
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,748
Unclip us.
There's a big clip!

445
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,458
I can't see.
I can't do it!

446
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,046
I'm going to unhook you,
all right?

447
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:11,924
One, two, three!

448
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,512
Are you okay, buddy?
I'm gonna drop myself down now.

449
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,181
The camera's still on.

450
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,062
He's alive.
I know he's alive.

451
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,939
We're gonna find him.

452
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,652
Can you fly
one of those?

453
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,362
Maybe.

454
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,531
As long as the sail is not torn.

455
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,283
Well, let's take it.

456
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,661
If we spot a plane, it might be
a good way to get attention.

457
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,455
Pull it over this way.

458
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,633
I got it, hold on!
Okay. Okay.

459
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,218
Oh, my God!

460
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,144
Okay, you're free.

461
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,732
Get her back, Mr. Kirby!

462
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,400
Amanda!

463
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,027
Wait!

464
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,581
Amanda!

465
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,133
Amanda, stop.

466
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,471
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about Ben.

467
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,935
It's not Ben, Paul.

468
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,189
It's Eric. He's out
there all by himself.

469
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,359
I know, I know.

470
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,695
Our baby is out
here all by himself.

471
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,365
Listen to me.
We'll find him.

472
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,242
I promise.

473
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,084
Paul.

474
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,589
Dr. Grant!

475
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,634
You should
come look at this!

476
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,166
Raptor.

477
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,055
We're going
to find him.

478
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,683
Are you listening to me?
We're going to find him.

479
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,518
Kid's got resources.

480
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,021
Remember what it was like
to try to ground him?

481
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,649
Where's Billy?

482
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,949
What are you doing?

483
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,784
I was photographing
the nest.

484
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,953
Don't do that again.

485
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,080
I'm sorry.

486
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,335
If I lose you, it's just
me and the damn tourists.

487
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,803
I bet you
Eric is in there.

488
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,431
Don't you think?
I'd bet my bottom dollar!

489
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,893
What do you think it is?

490
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,355
As far as I'm concerned,
it's the Four Seasons.

491
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,101
Eric!

492
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,560
Paul! Don't.

493
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,863
What the hell.

494
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:03,716
Who's got some change?
It only takes quarters.

495
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,260
I've got $1 . 10.

496
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,942
This is how you
make dinosaurs?

497
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,527
No.

498
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,697
This is how you play God.

499
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,963
This way!

500
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,469
It's locked!

501
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,724
This way, this way!
Go! Go!

502
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,907
Hey, over here!

503
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,961
Push, push!

504
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:56,972
My God.

505
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,100
He's calling for help.

506
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,060
Come on!

507
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,752
Into the herd!

508
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,365
Head for the trees!

509
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,519
Udesky.

510
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,081
Mr. Kirby!

511
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,834
Billy?

512
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:49,960
Is Alan with you?

513
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,177
Oh, my God.

514
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,887
Mr. Udesky!

515
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,392
He's dead.

516
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,854
Oh, my God.
No, he's not.

517
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,647
No, wait.
Something's not right.

518
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:11,898
We've got to help him.

519
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,817
Amanda!

520
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,449
Hold on!

521
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,583
They set a trap.

522
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,210
They actually set a trap.

523
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,468
What are you saying?

524
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:42,012
What are you looking for?

525
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,377
Wait!

526
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,686
Thanks.

527
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,813
Thanks a lot, Eric.

528
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,652
You know who I am?
Yeah.

529
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,364
Your parents are here.
They're looking for you.

530
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,283
Together?

531
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:27,909
Together.

532
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,288
That's not good.

533
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,415
They don't do
so well together.

534
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,752
You'd be surprised what people
can do when they have to.

535
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:54,853
You're Alan Grant.

536
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,148
What are you doing here?

537
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,610
Your parents

538
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,779
invited me along.

539
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,222
I read both
of your books.

540
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,517
I liked
the first one more.

541
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,810
Before you were on
the island.

542
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,647
You liked dinosaurs
back then.

543
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,858
Back then, they hadn't
tried to eat me yet.

544
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,073
When InGen cleared out, they
left a lot of stuff behind.

545
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,241
Any weapons?

546
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:52,202
No, and I just used the
last of the gas grenades.

547
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,995
And I appreciate that.

548
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,085
Be careful with that.
T-Rex.

549
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,462
It scares the
smaller ones away

550
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,965
but it attracts one really
big one with a fin.

551
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,592
This is T-Rex pee?

552
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,556
How did you get it?

553
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,349
You don't want to know.

554
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,731
Dessert?
Sure.

555
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:27,862
I have to tell you,

556
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:31,074
I'm astonished you've lasted
eight weeks on this island.

557
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,661
Is that all it's been?

558
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,582
You're alive and
that's the important thing.

559
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,960
Thanks to you, that's one
thing we have in common.

560
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,548
Did you read
Malcolm's book?

561
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:48,800
Yeah.

562
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,303
So?

563
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,388
I don't know.
I mean...

564
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,557
It was kind of preachy.

565
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,685
And too much chaos.
Everything is chaos.

566
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,521
Seemed like he
was high on himself.

567
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:06,568
That's two things
that we have in common.

568
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:14,200
Listen.

569
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,119
Compys!

570
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,395
Alan!

571
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,748
No matter how this turns
out it wasn't your fault.

572
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:05,418
Eric's always been
a strong-willed kid.

573
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:06,836
Always.

574
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:11,007
Then you throw someone like Ben
Hildebrand into the mix, and...

575
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,385
well.

576
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:15,553
Well, what?

577
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,932
All I'm saying is,
it's not your fault.

578
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,521
No.

579
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,399
If he'd been with you,
he'd be completely safe.

580
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,277
You drive five miles
under the speed limit.

581
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,281
And I've totaled
three cars in three years.

582
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,744
Well, not three. The Buick
wasn't really totaled.

583
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:44,290
I just said it was, because
I wanted to get the S. U.V.

584
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,631
I am so sorry that
you have to be here.

585
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:55,969
I'm not.

586
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,049
There's a boat,
right alongside the bank.

587
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:17,300
Looks in good shape.

588
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,510
Rescue boat?

589
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,220
No, no.

590
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,889
Just something left behind.

591
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,390
But it floats.

592
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:37,904
We stick to the plan.

593
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,156
Head for the coast.

594
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:42,075
You're not gonna
look for Dr. Grant?

595
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,868
The coast
was Alan's idea.

596
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:45,662
If he's alive,
that's where he's headed.

597
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:46,788
I agree.

598
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,248
What about Eric?

599
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,291
Eric's a smart kid.

600
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,919
He probably knows his best
chance is by the coast.

601
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:56,047
He figures the big dinosaurs are
in the center of the island.

602
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,382
Right?

603
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:00,093
Sure.

604
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,768
You know what this is?

605
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,145
It's a raptor claw.
I used to have one.

606
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:12,939
A fossil.

607
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,650
Mine is new.

608
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,654
How much of the island
did you explore?

609
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,240
I stayed pretty close
to the compound.

610
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,158
I figured if anyone
came looking for me,

611
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:25,952
that's where they'd start.

612
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:29,080
We need to get to the coast.
That was the plan.

613
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,290
Are you sure?

614
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:33,084
The closer you get to water,
the bigger things get.

615
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,753
If we can find our way
down into the canyon

616
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,506
we can follow that
river out to the coast.

617
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,134
After we find your parents.

618
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:42,802
Then what?

619
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,346
One step at a time.
Listen.

620
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,183
What?

621
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,477
That's my dad's
satellite phone!

622
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,608
Wait a minute.
How do you know?

623
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:00,403
"Kirby Paint and
Tile Plus, in Westgate!"

624
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:02,530
Dad!

625
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,671
Mum!

626
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:25,094
Mum! Dad!

627
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,890
Eric! This way!

628
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:33,811
Mum! Dad!

629
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,738
Mum, Dad!
Mum, Dad!

630
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,872
I knew it. My God.

631
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:54,916
I knew it.

632
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,711
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

633
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,838
Boy,
am I glad to see you.

634
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,882
Hey, you got my bag.

635
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:05,885
Yeah. Lucky strap.

636
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:08,763
Want me to carry it?

637
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,225
We need to
find a gap here.

638
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,562
How did you know we were here?
The phone.

639
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,856
That stupid jingle from the store.
I heard it.

640
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:21,067
My phone?
Your satellite phone.

641
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,735
Where is it?
I don't have it.

642
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,529
When did you use it last?

643
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,823
On the plane.

644
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,075
I got a call
on the plane and...

645
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,329
What?
I loaned it to Nash.

646
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,999
He must have had it
when he...

647
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:47,844
Run.

648
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,660
Alan, you want to
give me the bag back?

649
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,662
It's okay, I got it.

650
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:59,207
Please, give me the bag.

651
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,545
It's not safe.

652
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,475
Raptor eggs.

653
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,355
Did you steal raptor eggs?

654
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,030
Now it all makes sense.

655
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,700
I swear, if I'd known you were
going to end up with them...

656
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,079
It was an impulse,

657
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,455
I thought they'd
be worth a fortune.

658
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,625
Enough to fund the dig site
another 10 more years.

659
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,586
You have to believe me.
This was a stupid decision,

660
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,797
but I did it with
the best intentions.

661
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,007
"With the best intentions."

662
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,512
Some of the worst
things imaginable

663
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,973
have been done with
the best intentions.

664
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,600
You know what, Billy?

665
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:04,730
As far as I'm concerned, you're no better
than the people that built this place.

666
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,040
What are you doing?

667
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,293
Those things are after us
because of those.

668
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:28,921
Those things know
we have the eggs.

669
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:33,384
If I drop them in the river,
they'll still be after us.

670
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,845
What if they catch us
with them?

671
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,847
What if they catch us
without them?

672
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,145
There's a boat at the bottom,
just downriver.

673
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,939
We can try and make it
to the coast, at least.

674
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,163
You okay?
Yeah.

675
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,094
Let's do this one
at a time, shall we?

676
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,175
Okay, come on over!

677
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,553
One at a time!

678
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,138
All right, Eric.

679
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,348
I'm going to leave
you just for a minute.

680
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,559
And then you'll be
right behind me, okay?

681
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,768
Mum!

682
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,855
I've been alone in a water
truck for eight weeks.

683
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:54,066
I think I can manage the next
two minutes without you.

684
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:59,280
Right, we're
all together now.

685
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,849
Okay, Eric.

686
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:28,601
- Okay.
- Come on, honey!

687
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,894
Over you go.

688
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:05,054
Mum?

689
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:08,766
Oh, my God.

690
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,476
What is it?

691
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:12,812
It's a birdcage.

692
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,605
For what?

693
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,363
Dad!

694
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,572
Eric!

695
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,216
I can't see him!

696
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,268
No!

697
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,652
This way!

698
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:18,794
Billy, stop!

699
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:22,006
Billy, stop!
Don't, Billy!

700
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,235
Eric, hold on!

701
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:49,575
Eric!

702
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:03,923
Jump!

703
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:31,951
Billy!

704
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:45,923
Let go now!

705
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,512
Eric!
He's there.

706
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:48,944
There he is!
He's across the river!

707
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:50,988
Get him out of here!

708
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,159
No!
Go, Eric!

709
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:56,994
What about Billy?

710
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,260
Hang on, Billy!

711
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:23,020
Wait.

712
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,025
Get away!

713
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:55,112
There's plenty of gasoline.

714
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,198
Now we've just got to
make our way to the coast.

715
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:01,160
Work out some
sort of a signal.

716
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:05,330
Build a fire or something.
Something they can see from the air.

717
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:12,504
Dr. Grant?

718
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,300
Hey, Eric,
how are you doing?

719
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,853
I'm sorry
about Billy.

720
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,526
You know what the last thing
I said to him was?

721
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,320
I said,

722
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:39,740
"You're as bad as the people
that built this place."

723
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:45,287
Which wasn't true.
Billy was just young. That's all.

724
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:50,250
I have a theory that there
are two kinds of boys.

725
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:52,461
There are those who
want to be astronomers

726
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,005
and those who
want to be astronauts.

727
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,467
The astronomer,
or the paleontologist

728
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:02,137
gets to study
these amazing things

729
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:04,181
from a place of
complete safety.

730
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:07,017
But then you never
get to go into space.

731
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,435
Exactly.

732
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:11,897
It's the difference between
imagining and seeing.

733
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,525
To be able
to touch them.

734
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:19,279
And that's all Billy wanted.

735
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,538
Dr. Grant.

736
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:58,652
You know something,
Dr. Grant?

737
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:01,822
Billy was right.

738
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:28,932
Listen.

739
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:51,580
Find it before
it stops ringing!

740
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,582
Eric, you stay on
that boat.

741
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,754
It's here. It's here.

742
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,506
God.

743
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:09,681
I got it.

744
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,316
Hello? Hello?

745
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,945
You, too, can own a timeshare
in beautiful Guadalajara.

746
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,906
Enjoy a meal in one of
our four-star restaurants.

747
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,074
Look out!

748
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,012
Turn off the power.

749
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:51,014
You've got juice
for maybe one call.

750
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:53,350
Whatever you do, don't call the U.
S. Embassy.

751
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,268
They won't do a damn thing.

752
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:58,105
Hey, guys, come here!
Look at this!

753
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:06,238
Bonitos.

754
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:07,906
Something must
have spooked them!

755
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,575
Get the engine
going, Mr. Kirby.

756
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,584
Open the throttle!

757
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,342
Pick up.

758
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:33,849
Hello?

759
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,142
Ellie?

760
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,768
Hello?

761
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,186
Charlie!

762
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:40,772
Charlie!
Hello?

763
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:44,609
Charlie, take the phone
to Mummy now!

764
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,195
Take the phone to Mummy!

765
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,489
It's the dinosaur man!

766
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:51,283
Okay.

767
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:52,492
Listen to me, Charlie.

768
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:54,703
Charlie!

769
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,832
Are you taking the
phone to Mum? Charlie!

770
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,571
Hi, everybody!

771
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,957
It's great to be here!

772
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:43,418
Hi, there! How are you?

773
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,846
This is going to be great.

774
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,945
Who's on the phone?
The dinosaur man.

775
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:11,655
He is? Alan?

776
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,908
Look in the boxes!
Find a weapon!

777
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:23,875
Where's the phone?

778
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,585
There!
Get the phone!

779
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:36,930
Ellie, listen to me!

780
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,474
Are you on a cell phone?
I can't hear you.

781
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:42,727
The river! Site B!
The river!

782
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:46,815
Hello?

783
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,944
Dad! Dad!

784
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:15,547
Dad!

785
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,886
Paul, you jerk!

786
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:26,391
You can't leave me
like this!

787
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,729
I'm not going anywhere!

788
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:50,332
Remember when we went fishing
a couple of summers ago?

789
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:54,461
I was putting the boat in the
water and the trailer sank?

790
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:58,965
The tow truck tried to pull us
out and it got dragged in, too.

791
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:02,635
The truck driver wanted
to knock my lights out.

792
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:09,601
I miss fishing.

793
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:16,608
Mr. Kirby?

794
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:24,282
That lady you called.
Who is she?

795
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,285
How do you know
that she can help us?

796
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,371
She's the one person
I could always count on.

797
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,663
I owe her a lot.

798
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:33,708
I don't think
I ever told her that.

799
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:34,834
You should.

800
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:39,130
You hear that?

801
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,966
The ocean.

802
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,235
They want the eggs.

803
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,488
Otherwise,
we'd be dead already.

804
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:11,913
Everybody get down.
She's challenging us.

805
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,268
She thinks
you stole the eggs.

806
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:34,477
Get behind me.

807
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:57,876
Give me the eggs.

808
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:19,898
Do it, Mum.

809
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,585
No. Call for help.

810
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:28,967
That's a helicopter.

811
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:41,729
Dr. Grant?
Dr. Alan Grant?

812
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,273
Stop!

813
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:45,900
That's a very bad idea!

814
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,411
Second Squad, move!
Wow!

815
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:01,082
You have to thank her now.
She sent the Navy and the Marines.

816
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,586
God bless you, Ellie.

817
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:19,183
Dr. Grant, is this man with you?
What?

818
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:30,528
You made it.

819
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:33,281
Yeah.

820
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,867
I rescued your hat.

821
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:38,578
Dr. Grant,
we need to go now!

822
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:39,954
Oh, yeah.

823
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,459
Well, that's
the important thing.

824
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:46,127
Dr. Grant!

825
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:51,382
Can I get you to sit
here and buckle up, sir?

826
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:01,809
Sea Shadow to Dust Storm,
six souls on board.

827
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,647
Dust Storm to
Sea Shadow, roger.

828
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,944
What the hell is that?

829
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:14,822
Dr. Grant, look!

830
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,751
Where do you think
they're going?

831
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:30,672
I don't know. Maybe just looking
for new nesting grounds.

832
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,757
It's a whole
new world for them.

833
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:35,259
I dare them to nest
in Enid, Oklahoma.

834
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:43,434
Let's go home.
