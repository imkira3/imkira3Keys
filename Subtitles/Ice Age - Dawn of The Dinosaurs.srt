3
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:20,959
It's happening!

4
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:26,695
Wait up, guys!

5
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:35,557
The baby is coming! The baby
is coming! I'm having a baby.

6
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:39,260
- Code blue, code blue.
- Or pink, if it's a girl

7
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,961
Coming up baby! Coming up baby!
I'm coming, Ellie!

8
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:45,257
We got it.

9
00:03:58,184 --> 00:04:04,232
- Ellie, Ellie! Where are you? Where am I?
- Manny!

10
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,341
I told you! It was just a kick.

11
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,311
Oh... right! Right... Oh, wow!

12
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:19,211
Oh, you really gave daddy a scare!
Daddy got silly.

13
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:25,609
Daddy fall down cliff and go
boom, boom, boom. Silly daddy!

14
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:34,855
Sorry, folks. False alarm.
It was just a kick.

15
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:38,226
- Do you know who I want to kick?
- That's the third false alarm this week.

16
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:41,982
Allright show's over...
break it up, break it up!

17
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:45,839
Oh, I see someone else
who has a bun in the oven?

18
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,341
I'm not pregnant!

19
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:52,788
Too bad.
You'd make a wonderful mother.

20
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,536
Manny, I know you're excited.
I am too.

21
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,037
But you're getting a
little carried away.

22
00:04:58,074 --> 00:05:00,193
Okay, okay...

23
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:03,565
Boy, you're starting
to sound like Diego.

24
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:08,465
Wait a second... Where is Diego?

25
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:05,086
My hooves are burning, baby!
They are burning!

26
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:10,403
Oh, look at this! I got to tiptoe!
I got to tiptoe! Eat my dust, dingo!

27
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:18,016
- Huh, can I look now?
- Easy, don't freak out the baby.

28
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:22,081
The baby is fine. It's the freaked
out daddy I'm worried about.

29
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:25,278
Ah, uh, uh! No peeking.

30
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:30,319
- Voila! Playground for junior...
- Oh, wow!

31
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:41,996
It's amazing.

32
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:58,058
- Oh, Manny...
- I made it myself. Our family.

33
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:05,461
Hey why aren't I up there?

34
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,908
- You can be on ours.
- You'd fit right in.

35
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:15,367
Of course, it's still work in progress.
Few rough edges, here and there.

36
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:19,350
I don't believe it!
You're trying to baby proof nature.

37
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,727
Baby proof nature?
Get outta here.

38
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:25,690
That's ridiculous.

39
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:30,589
Manny, this is the world our baby's
gonna grow up in. You can't change that.

40
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:35,455
Of course I can, I'm the
biggest thing on earth.

41
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:41,711
Okay big daddy, I can't wait to see,
how you handle the teen years.

42
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:46,545
Come on, Sid. I don't want you
touching anything. This place is for kids.

43
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:53,115
Are you a kid?
Don't answer that.

44
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:07,085
Diego, there you are.
You missed the big surprise.

45
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:11,220
- I'll check it out later.
- Okay. See ya!

46
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:14,037
You know, I think there's
something bothering, Diego.

47
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:15,428
No, I'm sure everything's fine.

48
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:16,940
You should talk to him.

49
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:19,910
Guys don't talk to guys,
about guy problems.

50
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:25,194
- We just punch each other on the shoulders.
- That's stupid!

51
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:30,443
To a girl, but for a guy, that's
like six months of therapy.

52
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,344
Okay, Okay I'm going.

53
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:40,140
- Hey!
- Oww!

54
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:46,605
- Why'd you do that?
- I don't know.

55
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:52,824
So, listen! Ellie thinks theres
something bothering you...

56
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,910
Actually, I've been thinking, that soon,
it might be time for me to head out.

57
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:03,253
Okay. So, I'll just tell her that
you're fine. It was nothing.

58
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,443
Look, who are we kidding, Manny?
I'm losing my edge.

59
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:09,596
I'm not really built for
chaperoning playdates.

60
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:11,072
What do you talking about?

61
00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:15,071
Having a family, that's huge.
And I'm happy for you, but...

62
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:19,973
- It's your adventure, not mine.
- So, you don't want to be around my kid?

63
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,101
No, no, no... That's...
You're taking this the wrong way.

64
00:09:23,137 --> 00:09:26,820
No, go! Go find some adventure,
Mr. adventure guy!

65
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:31,444
Don't let my boring domestic life
hit you on the bottom, on your way out.

66
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:35,615
Isn't Ellie supposed to be the one
with the hormonal imbalance?

67
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:39,645
Manny, wait! No one has to leave.

68
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:42,704
- So?
- That's why guys don't talk to guys.

69
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:48,230
- Why? What happened?
- Diego's leaving.

70
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:54,540
Whoa, whoa! This should be the best
time of our lives. We're having a baby.

71
00:09:54,576 --> 00:10:00,431
- No, Sid. They're havin' a baby
- Yeah, but we're a herd. We're a family

72
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,854
Look things have changed.
Manny has other priority's now.

73
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:12,214
Face it, Sid. We had a great run,
but... now it's time to move on.

74
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:18,158
- So, it's just the two of us.
- No, Sid. It's not the two of us.

75
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:21,912
Crash and Eddie are coming with us?

76
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:26,708
Just Crash?
Just Eddie?

77
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:32,129
Goodbye, Sid!

78
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,145
Okay, calm down. Calm down.
I'm good at making friends.

79
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:51,107
I'll make my own herd.
That's what I'll do!

80
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:56,531
Hey! "Me amigo's. Que pasa?"

81
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,854
Well, at least you still got your looks.

82
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,573
Oh, great!

83
00:11:25,622 --> 00:11:29,481
Anybody here?

84
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:51,484
Hello?

85
00:11:57,427 --> 00:12:03,265
Oh, poor guys! I know what
it's like to feel abandoned.

86
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,587
Don't worry,
you're not alone anymore.

87
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:46,227
There you go.

88
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:01,712
Stay here! You take care
of your brother now.

89
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,743
Momma's coming right back.

90
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,332
Momma's coming, baby!

91
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,214
I got you.

92
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:20,948
What did I just tell you kids?

93
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:28,935
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

94
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:33,627
Bad eggs, rotten eggs!
A heart attack you almost gave me.

95
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:40,614
Oh, I'm sorry, darling!
It's just that I love you so much.

96
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,909
Hello!

97
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,548
I'd like to present, Eggbert,
Shelly and Yoko.

98
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:51,668
Sid, whatever you're doing.
It's a bad idea!

99
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:53,647
Shh! My kids will hear you.

100
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:56,777
They're not your kids, Sid.
Take them back.

101
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,227
- You're not meant to be a parent.
- Why not?

102
00:14:59,228 --> 00:15:01,639
First sign: stealing
someone else's eggs.

103
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:05,432
Second sign: one of them
almost became an omelet.

104
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:08,767
Sid, someone must be
worried sick looking for them.

105
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:11,479
No, they were underground, in ice.

106
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:16,864
If it wasn't for me they'd be...
Egg sickles.

107
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:21,384
Sid, I know what you're going through.
You're gonna have a family too someday.

108
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:28,892
You gonna meet a nice girl, with... with low
standards, no real options, or sense of smell...

109
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,480
- What Manny means to say is...
- No, I get it. I'll take them back.

110
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:39,111
You have your family and I'm
better off alone. By myself.

111
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:43,594
A fortress of solitude.

112
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:47,263
In the ice, for ever!

113
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,857
Alone, lonely loner..

114
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:53,710
- That's a lot of aloners.
- Precisely!

115
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,097
- Sid, wait.
- No, no, it's ok.

116
00:15:57,098 --> 00:16:01,739
He'll bounce back, it's one of
the advantages of being Sid.

117
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,503
Why should I take you back.
I love kids.

118
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:22,071
I'm responsible, loving, nurturing.
What do you think?

119
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:27,807
I knew you would agree.

120
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:35,420
Oh, oh, don't cry!
I'll find a dry place.

121
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:43,863
Let me just dry you off.

122
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:50,747
I don't know, being
a parents, a lot of work.

123
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,187
Maybe I'm not ready.

124
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,228
Mamma, mama, mama!

125
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:41,693
I'm a mommy.

126
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:45,030
Where's mommy?

127
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:49,304
Here I am!

128
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:53,685
There you go, nice clean faces.

129
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:12,664
I got it! I got it!

130
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:19,858
Stop it, no.

131
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,175
Hey, no biting!

132
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:32,162
I'm sorry, no, it's okay, it's okay.
Don't cry! Why you still crying?

133
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:38,209
Are you hungry? Maybe you're hungry.
I know just the thing.

134
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:49,786
...this is animal
I am your baby and this is my milk

135
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:56,147
Ahhhh!
I thought you were a female!

136
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:26,134
I'm sorry, but you can't go in.
Manny says, It's just for kids.

137
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:31,451
Wait a minute...
You are kids!

138
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:34,646
Just don't break anything!

139
00:21:34,682 --> 00:21:41,253
- The Sloth says the playground's open!
- No, wait. Not for everyone!

140
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,595
No, no. Don't touch that!

141
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:58,458
- What are they?
- Who cares? Their fun!

142
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,969
Mommy, his not sharing.

143
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,878
- Aren't you gonna do something.
- Why my kid had it first.

144
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:09,682
- Did not!
- Did to!

145
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:13,265
- What is the matter with you?
- I'm a single mother with 3 kids.

146
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:16,707
I could use a little compassion.

147
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:22,651
- No don't!
- No, don't! Stop!

148
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:29,116
- Ronald!
- Whoa! That's insane.

149
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:34,641
Stop! Stop! Stop!

150
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:43,296
- Hold on, little Johnny!
- I'm trying!

151
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:48,822
You know, experts say that you should
let the kids eat whatever they want.

152
00:22:49,343 --> 00:22:55,599
- Do you think my ankles look fat?
- Ankles. What ankles?

153
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:01,543
Ronald, where did you come from?

154
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:04,461
Oh, no!

155
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:09,260
Okay, come on! Spit him out!
If you don't spit out little Johnny,

156
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:13,326
we're leaving the playground
this instantly... One...

157
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:18,227
Two... Don't make me say "three".

158
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:23,650
- There we are! A picture of health.
- That's not little Johnny.

159
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:27,820
- Well, better than nothing.
- Madison!

160
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:31,575
- Come on, barf him up!
- Sid!

161
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:37,204
- Hello, Manny!
- Little Johnny!

162
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:43,252
Oh, wait... No! No!

163
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:46,692
Oh, I'm really sorry.

164
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:53,470
This place is totalled.

165
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:58,164
- And we didn't reck it.
- We're losing our touch bro!

166
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:03,690
The important thing is that no
one got hurt. Except for that guy.

167
00:24:03,726 --> 00:24:07,862
And, and those three... and her.

168
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:14,393
I told you to take them back, and
you kept them! Now look what they've done.

169
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:16,934
Okay granted, we do have
some discipline issues.

170
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:19,437
Eating kids is not
a discipline issue.

171
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:25,341
- But he spit them out!
- Well, that's super! Lets give him a gold star!

172
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:26,969
They don't belong here, Sid.

173
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,740
Whatever they are, wherever
you found them, take them back.

174
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:35,805
Manny, I'm not getting rid of my kids!

175
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,039
Earthquake!

176
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:43,522
It's Okay, It's okay, mamma's here!

177
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:48,632
Do earthquakes, shriek?

178
00:25:15,118 --> 00:25:21,582
- I thought those guys were extinct.
- Well then, that is one angry fossil. Sid!

179
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:25,752
Come on, inside, inside, inside.

180
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:45,044
Nobody move a muscle!

181
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:18,932
No, no, no, don't cry.

182
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:24,877
We are poor little lambs
who have lost our way.

183
00:26:24,913 --> 00:26:28,109
Baah, baaah!
Ahhhh!

184
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:43,020
- Sid! Give them to her. She's their mother.
- How do I know she's their mother?

185
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:46,931
What do you want, a birth
certificate? She's a Dinosaur!

186
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:50,736
Well I've put in the, blood,
sweat and tears to raise them.

187
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:56,784
- For a day! Give them back, you lunatic!
- Look, these are my kids!

188
00:26:57,411 --> 00:27:02,519
And you're gonna have to go
through me to get them!

189
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:10,653
- Sid!
- Help!

190
00:27:16,596 --> 00:27:22,123
- Run!
- Don't you have anything better to do?

191
00:27:22,748 --> 00:27:27,648
- Help!
- Sid?

192
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:46,940
- Sid must be down there.
- Well, his dead! Real shame.

193
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:51,803
- He will be missed.
- Oh, no, no, no! Not so fast!

194
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,523
Okay. Ellie, this is where I draw the line.
You, Crash and Eddie back to the village.

195
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,442
Yeah that's gonna happen.

196
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:03,205
Ellie! You saw that thing?
This is gonna be dangerous.

197
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:04,771
Talk to the trunk.

198
00:28:04,772 --> 00:28:09,358
Oh, great! After we save Sid,
I'm gonna kill him.

199
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,121
- Ladies first!
- Age before beauty!

200
00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:16,134
- No pain, no gain!
- What pain?

201
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:29,379
- Sid?
- Sid?

202
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:44,810
Oh, no, no, no! Not good. Not good.

203
00:28:45,122 --> 00:28:48,983
Ellie! Ellie! Wait up!

204
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:54,039
Okay look, if you feel anything,
even if it's nothing...

205
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,532
...you gotta tell me.
And we're outta here.

206
00:28:58,262 --> 00:29:03,269
We need a code word.
Yeah, something that says, "the baby's coming. "

207
00:29:03,581 --> 00:29:07,752
Hmm. How about "Aaah! The
baby's coming!" How's that?

208
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:13,382
Nah, too long. We need something
short and punchy, like, uh... "peaches"!

209
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:14,790
Peaches?

210
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:18,699
I love peaches, they're
sweet and round and fuzzy.

211
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:21,620
- Just like you.
- You think I'm round?

212
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:28,607
Uh... Round is good.
Round is foxy!

213
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:41,745
Stay close.

214
00:30:00,826 --> 00:30:06,249
- Are you guys havin' the same dream I am?
- We've been living above an entire world.

215
00:30:06,285 --> 00:30:10,733
And we didn't even know it.

216
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:35,236
Run for it! Hurry.

217
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:46,566
- Diego, what are you doing here?
- Sight seeing. Looking for Sid, same as you!

218
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:48,064
Well aren't you noble.

219
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:52,442
This is not the time guys.
We need all the help we can get!

220
00:31:02,764 --> 00:31:05,789
Never mind!

221
00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:19,412
Here, boy. Here, come on!

222
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:21,868
Are you nuts! We're
not getting on that thing!

223
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:25,495
It's either this
dinosaur, or that one!

224
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:33,943
Pregnant lady, wants a lift.
Yabba, dabba, Do!

225
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:46,768
Don't ever, yabba, dabba, do that again!

226
00:31:51,564 --> 00:31:57,716
- I feel so... puny.
- How do you think I feel?

227
00:32:08,877 --> 00:32:11,793
Ouch!

228
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:23,786
Take cover!

229
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:15,817
Dude, you're awesome!
You're like the brother I never had! Me too.

230
00:33:27,184 --> 00:33:30,833
Can we keep him?

231
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,040
- Buck.
- What?

232
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,776
The name's Buck.
Short for Buckminster.

233
00:33:37,193 --> 00:33:40,532
Long for "Buh!".

234
00:33:41,677 --> 00:33:44,910
A little dull.

235
00:33:45,015 --> 00:33:48,664
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend was taken by a dinosaur.

236
00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:54,608
Well, his dead. Welcome to my world.
Now, uh, go home.

237
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:56,396
- Off you pop!
- Not without, Sid.

238
00:33:56,432 --> 00:34:00,030
Ellie wait, maybe the
deranged hermit has a point.

239
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:03,825
Manny! We came this
far, we're gonna find him.

240
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:06,287
I got tracks.

241
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:10,039
Let's go.

242
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:16,399
If you go in there, you'll find
your friend... in the AFTER-LIFE!

243
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:21,094
How do you know, oh, great
and wisely, weasely one?

244
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:34,822
Mummy dinosaur carrying three babies,
and... some floppy green thing?

245
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:37,297
Yeah, we're friends with
the floppy green thing.

246
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:38,924
You got all that from the tracks?

247
00:34:39,237 --> 00:34:43,720
No, not really. I saw 'em come through
here earlier. She's headed for Lava Falls.

248
00:34:44,971 --> 00:34:47,646
That's where they care, for the newborns.

249
00:34:47,682 --> 00:34:51,853
To get there! You got to go
through the jungle of misery.

250
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:55,816
Across the chasm of death.

251
00:34:56,233 --> 00:35:01,134
- To the plates of wow.
- Wow!

252
00:35:01,238 --> 00:35:06,555
Okay! Good luck with the slow decadence
to madness, we're gonna go now.

253
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,519
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

254
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,803
What you... You think this is
some sort of tropical getaway?

255
00:35:13,804 --> 00:35:16,880
You can't protect your mate, mate!

256
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:20,269
What are you gonna do with
those... those flimsy tusks?

257
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,867
When you run into the Beast?

258
00:35:24,285 --> 00:35:27,723
I call him "Rudy".

259
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:34,710
Oh good. Good. I was worried it was
something intimidating, like Sheldon or Tim.

260
00:35:34,814 --> 00:35:38,046
Wait! You mean there's something
bigger than Mommy Dinosaur?

261
00:35:38,152 --> 00:35:39,193
Aye!

262
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:41,592
- Aye?
- Aye! Aye!

263
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:47,117
- He's the one that gave me this.
- Whoa! He gave you that patch?

264
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:52,541
- For free? That's so cool.
- Yeah, maybe he'll give us one too!

265
00:35:55,981 --> 00:36:00,882
Welcome to my world!

266
00:36:01,821 --> 00:36:06,357
- Abandon all hope, he who enters there!
- Alright we get it.

267
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,894
Doom and despair.
Yadda, yadda, yadda!

268
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:28,890
Sounds like a jungle of misery to me.

269
00:37:39,943 --> 00:37:44,530
- Hold on.
- Why? What's wrong? Peaches?

270
00:37:44,843 --> 00:37:50,059
- No, it's just I got a funny feeling.
- You're hungry, low blood sugar!

271
00:37:50,474 --> 00:37:53,270
- There's some fruit.
- No, Manny!

272
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:55,860
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

273
00:37:55,897 --> 00:37:58,554
This isn't exactly your playground.

274
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:01,841
Like I'm going to be afraid
of a pretty flower.

275
00:38:04,341 --> 00:38:08,409
- Bet you didn't see that coming?
- Manny?

276
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:12,682
For the record, I blame you for this.

277
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:17,168
Stop eating our friends, plant!

278
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:27,177
- That's it, I'm tearing it up, from the roots.
- Do that and it'll clamp-shut forever.

279
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,906
Alright, preggers.
Don't get your trunk in a knot.

280
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:32,161
I'll have them out of
there before they're digested.

281
00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:33,643
Digested?

282
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,572
They'll be nothing
but bones in 3 minutes.

283
00:38:35,573 --> 00:38:39,377
- Well maybe 5 for the fat one.
- I'm not fat!

284
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:41,602
I feel tingly.

285
00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:43,758
Don't say that, when you're
pressed up against me.

286
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:49,807
- Not that kind of tingly.
- I can feel it too.

287
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:53,682
- Help, someone help us!
- Hurry!

288
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:57,522
It's time to get... Buck wild.

289
00:39:06,282 --> 00:39:09,513
Who's fat now?

290
00:39:31,724 --> 00:39:34,122
No!

291
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:19,063
- Tourists.
- Puked on by a plant. Awesome!

292
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:24,485
- Say something.
- Thanks for saving us.

293
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:28,240
Will you help us find
the floppy green thing?

294
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:30,534
- That's not necessary.
- Yes, it is.

295
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:37,831
Alright, I'll help ya. But I got rules.
Rule number one:

296
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:41,796
Always listen to Buck.
Rule number two:

297
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:47,530
Stay in the middle of the trail.
Rule number three:

298
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:55,455
He who has gas, travels
at the back of the pack.

299
00:40:56,915 --> 00:41:01,816
- Come on then! Chop, chop!
- We should all have our heads examined.

300
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:08,176
That's rule number four.
Now, let's go find your friend.

301
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:30,805
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
Don't worry, we're gonna be fine.

302
00:41:30,842 --> 00:41:35,496
Please swing a little more to...

303
00:41:38,728 --> 00:41:44,048
See, she's putting us down...

304
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,530
No! I'm too young to be eaten.

305
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:55,516
Wow! Nice mucus. And I
don't care for, everyone.

306
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:12,879
Listen these things get complicated.
Maybe we can work something out.

307
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:17,518
I can have them on Sundays to Tuesdays?
Wednesdays to Fridays? Weekends!

308
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:27,632
It's okay, mommas okay!

309
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:35,348
If you eat me, it will send a bad message.

310
00:42:38,373 --> 00:42:42,336
Ha! Score one for the sloth!

311
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:49,946
And the scores all tied up.

312
00:42:53,076 --> 00:42:59,436
- Do you think the beast will find, Sid?
- Or, more importantly, us?

313
00:42:59,473 --> 00:43:05,796
Rudy? Are you joking? He's relentless.
He knows all, sees all eats all.

314
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:09,445
So, that's a "yes".

315
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:16,641
Hey, get off my lawn! Go on shoo!

316
00:43:21,022 --> 00:43:26,823
I knew that guy when he was a caterpillar.
You know, before he came out.

317
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,829
So, you're just living down here by your wits!
All on your own, no responsibilities?

318
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:33,507
Not one! It's incredible.

319
00:43:33,508 --> 00:43:38,432
No dependence, no limits,
the greatest life a single guy can have.

320
00:43:38,469 --> 00:43:41,422
Did you hear that?
This is my kind of place.

321
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:47,612
Hello? No, no. I can't really talk right now.
I'm trying to recover a dead sloth.

322
00:43:49,383 --> 00:43:54,561
Now, they're following me!
I know, they think I'm crazy.

323
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:59,810
Okay... We're going into the Chasm of Death,
I'm gonna lose you. I love you too.

324
00:44:00,123 --> 00:44:04,294
- Alright. Goodbye, goodbye, bye.
- Okay, follow me!

325
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,884
That's you in three weeks.

326
00:44:25,148 --> 00:44:30,572
- So, why do they call it the chasm of death?
- Well we tried, 'big smelly crack'.

327
00:44:30,608 --> 00:44:35,264
- But, that just made everybody giggle.
- Well now what?

328
00:44:38,183 --> 00:44:43,292
- Madam...
- She is not doing that.

329
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:46,002
Rule number one.

330
00:44:48,506 --> 00:44:52,053
Come on, mammoth.
You supposed to have a good memory.

331
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,867
Always listen to Buck.

332
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:03,069
Now! Eyes forward!
Back straight... and... uh, yes...

333
00:45:03,106 --> 00:45:05,170
Breathe in the toxic fumes
and you'll probably die.

334
00:45:05,189 --> 00:45:06,233
Toxic fumes.

335
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:11,238
- Just another day in paradise.
- Wait!

336
00:45:11,274 --> 00:45:13,428
Geronimo!

337
00:45:23,438 --> 00:45:26,931
- Ellie! You okay?
- You have to try this.

338
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:30,423
Alright now pile on
everyone, couldn't be easier.

339
00:45:35,324 --> 00:45:42,519
Don't panic! Just some, technical
difficulties. Keep holding it in boys.

340
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:52,531
- I can't take it anymore.
- He breathe it. And now I'm breathing it.

341
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,785
- Hey we're not dead.
- You sound ridiculous.

342
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:02,539
Me? You should hear you.

343
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:07,405
Alright, alright.
And one, and two...

344
00:46:07,441 --> 00:46:12,447
- Christmas, Christmas time is here...
- Are you crazy?

345
00:46:14,428 --> 00:46:16,721
It's not poison.

346
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:24,751
It's so disturbing.

347
00:46:26,419 --> 00:46:32,363
- Stop laughing, all of you!
- "Stop laughing, all of you!"

348
00:46:34,345 --> 00:46:37,889
What's rule number one?

349
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,740
They're just laughing,
what's so bad about that?

350
00:46:42,741 --> 00:46:45,398
They died laughing.

351
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:52,644
- Stop laughing!
- Do you know what's funny though?

352
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,596
We're trying to save Sid
and now we're all gonna die!

353
00:46:57,909 --> 00:47:03,228
- And I don't even like Sid.
- Who does? He's an idiot!

354
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:08,337
Thanks for getting me into this mess.
It's the most fun I've had in years.

355
00:47:08,373 --> 00:47:14,385
Thank you, for deserting the herd.
That was totally super.

356
00:47:19,597 --> 00:47:25,541
Stop that! Don't you see?
We're all gonna die.

357
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:32,111
We gotta do everything, huh?

358
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:46,187
- Sometimes I wet my bed.
- That's alright. Sometimes I wet your bed.

359
00:47:56,615 --> 00:47:59,689
I'm not sure how much
of that you could hear?

360
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:02,768
Oh, I heard all of it.

361
00:48:02,804 --> 00:48:07,459
- You wet my bed?
- That was gas talk, dude.

362
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:12,779
- Well, we better get moving.
- Aren't we forgetting something?

363
00:48:15,176 --> 00:48:17,471
I'm so lonely.

364
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:40,202
Okay. Here you go guys...
Muncher, muncher.

365
00:48:45,207 --> 00:48:47,710
What? You're not gonna
eat your vegetables?

366
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:52,715
How you going to become
big and strong dinosaurs?

367
00:48:55,738 --> 00:48:59,649
No... I raised them vegetarian.

368
00:48:59,755 --> 00:49:04,394
It's a healthier lifestyle.
I mean look at me.

369
00:49:05,228 --> 00:49:10,128
Excuse me. I'm trying to
have a conversation here.

370
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:20,973
No, no, no! That's not for us kids.
Way to feathery, and fleshy, and...

371
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:24,205
...and alive!

372
00:49:30,355 --> 00:49:35,988
No, no, no!
We do not eat live animals, period.

373
00:49:36,024 --> 00:49:40,159
Now go, fly. Be free.

374
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:45,789
Little flightless bird.

375
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,378
My bad.

376
00:49:48,587 --> 00:49:50,966
Hey, where you going?

377
00:49:51,003 --> 00:49:53,923
This is how you resolve a conflict?

378
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:56,844
No wonder you're single.

379
00:49:59,346 --> 00:50:02,161
Oh, come on!
Am I talking to myself here?

380
00:50:02,187 --> 00:50:04,663
I say they're vegetarian.
You say "Grrr".

381
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:07,131
I say "Can we talk about this?".
You say "Grrr".

382
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,877
- I don't call that communication.
- Grrr!

383
00:50:09,914 --> 00:50:13,005
See? That's your answer to everything.

384
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:20,303
Grrr!

385
00:50:25,203 --> 00:50:30,314
What are you afraid of?
You're the biggest thing on Earth.

386
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:34,694
Aren't you?

387
00:50:47,102 --> 00:50:51,899
- They'll never survive. It's dangerous by day.
- But it's even worse at night.

388
00:50:51,935 --> 00:50:56,870
- Plus the guide is a lunatic!
- What? You mean Buck? Oh, he's whacko.

389
00:50:56,907 --> 00:50:58,235
I am not.

390
00:50:58,246 --> 00:51:00,397
- Totally bonkers!
- And his feet smell.

391
00:51:00,409 --> 00:51:01,804
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

392
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:04,100
Oh, you little...

393
00:51:04,725 --> 00:51:09,692
- He's strangling his own foot.
- Shouldn't we get moving?

394
00:51:09,729 --> 00:51:14,630
- And give Rudy a midnight snack? Not likely.
- The skulls right, take a load of mammals.

395
00:51:15,047 --> 00:51:21,720
We'll camp here. Now, who's hungry?
I am. You don't need the calories!

396
00:51:25,268 --> 00:51:31,106
There I was... My back
against the wall. No way out.

397
00:51:31,211 --> 00:51:40,178
Perched on a razor's edge of oblivion.
Staring into the eye, of the great white beast.

398
00:52:41,178 --> 00:52:46,808
- Were you killed?
- Sadly, yes. But I lived.

399
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:53,690
Never had I felt so alive, than
when I was so close... To death.

400
00:52:53,726 --> 00:52:56,089
Just before, Rudy could
suck me down his gullet.

401
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:01,197
I grabbed hold of that, roast pink fleshy thing
that dangles at the back of the throat.

402
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:09,191
I hung on to that sucker,
and I swung back and forth, back and forth.

403
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:17,882
Back... and forth and back. Until finally
I let go and shot right out of his mouth.

404
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:22,888
I may have lost an eye that day.
But I got this.

405
00:53:22,924 --> 00:53:25,874
Rudy's tooth...

406
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:31,594
It's like the old saying: "An eye for
a tooth". A nose for a chin. A butt for a"...

407
00:53:31,629 --> 00:53:35,866
It's an old saying. But
uh, it's not a very good one.

408
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:37,278
You are super-weasel.

409
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,446
- Ultra-weasel.
- Diesel-weasel.

410
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:47,355
What? He is.

411
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:51,354
Now let me tell you about the time I used
to sharpen, clam-shell to turn a T-Rex.

412
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,274
- Into a T-Rachel
- Yes, master.

413
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:57,507
Wow, that's enough
fairy-tales for one night.

414
00:53:57,508 --> 00:54:01,989
- Come on, Ellie. You should rest now...
- Pff.. Life at the party.

415
00:54:02,092 --> 00:54:05,347
Alright, you guys get some
shut-eye, I'll keep watch.

416
00:54:05,348 --> 00:54:07,516
Don't worry, Buck, we got this.

417
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:13,462
- Night time is possum time.
- Yeah, we own the night, baby.

418
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:29,205
Good night, Rudy.

419
00:54:40,779 --> 00:54:43,490
Wait, wait. What about me?

420
00:54:57,984 --> 00:55:05,492
Sleep well, kids. We have a busy
day tomorrow. Forging, Hunting...

421
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:11,225
Missing my friends.
Probably are not missing me.

422
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:15,814
What...

423
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:29,266
You're a real softie, you know that?

424
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:52,831
Manny?

425
00:55:56,586 --> 00:56:00,339
Crash? Eddie?

426
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:05,657
Manny?

427
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:26,722
What's going on? Are you okay?

428
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:31,065
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to keep you safe, and

429
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:34,505
Now you're in the most
dangerous place in the world.

430
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:40,433
This isn't your fault. It's bigger than
both of us. We have to get, Sid.

431
00:56:40,469 --> 00:56:46,324
Yeah, but If I had been a better friend
to him... we wouldn't be here.

432
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,426
Better friend?
Are you plucking my whiskers?

433
00:56:48,463 --> 00:56:53,415
You risked your life, your mate,
and your baby to save your buddy!

434
00:56:53,937 --> 00:56:58,734
Not the best husband or father,
but... a damn good friend.

435
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,084
Everybody stop!

436
00:58:19,232 --> 00:58:22,568
I smell something.

437
00:58:25,591 --> 00:58:29,659
Hmm, it smells like
a buzzard's butt fell off.

438
00:58:30,284 --> 00:58:32,683
- And then got sprayed on by a bunch of skunks.
- That's, Sid.

439
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:36,750
Mammal's, we have ourselves a crime scene.

440
00:58:39,774 --> 00:58:44,571
Half eaten carcass! Hunk of... Oh, no!

441
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:46,866
Broccoli!

442
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:48,300
Here's what I think happened:

443
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:52,286
Dinosaur attacked Sid, Sid fights back
with piece of broccoli.

444
00:58:52,806 --> 00:58:57,188
- Leaving dinosaur, a vegetable.
- Are you nuts?

445
00:58:57,394 --> 00:59:00,001
Sid's not violent,
or co-ordinated.

446
00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:04,175
- Yeah, and where's the dinosaur?
- Alright, alright. Good point.

447
00:59:04,382 --> 00:59:05,738
Theory two:

448
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:10,915
Sid's eating broccoli. Dinosaur eats Sid.
Dinosaur steps on broccoli.

449
00:59:10,952 --> 00:59:15,539
- Leaving broccoli, a vegetable.
- Buck, when exactly did you lose your mind?

450
00:59:15,644 --> 00:59:20,544
Umm... 3 months ago. I woke up
one morning married to a pineapple.

451
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,674
An ugly pineapple.

452
00:59:24,092 --> 00:59:25,497
But I loved her.

453
00:59:25,498 --> 00:59:29,721
Uh, Buck! I think you
missed a little clue over here.

454
00:59:31,182 --> 00:59:38,690
Your friend might be alive.
But not for long. Rudy's closing in.

455
00:59:38,691 --> 00:59:39,799
Wow...

456
00:59:39,836 --> 00:59:45,467
You got it. The plates of, wow.
Or whatever's left of them.

457
01:00:54,392 --> 01:00:59,397
Single file everyone.
Head for, Lava Falls.

458
01:01:11,388 --> 01:01:16,133
- What's that sound?
- It's the wind. It's speaking to us.

459
01:01:16,169 --> 01:01:20,877
- What's it saying?
- I don't know. I don't speak "wind".

460
01:01:28,906 --> 01:01:30,286
Ellie?

461
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:34,432
I'm fine, don't worry about me.
I'm just taking my...

462
01:01:37,141 --> 01:01:39,227
Ellie! Whoa!

463
01:01:40,688 --> 01:01:45,380
- Manny!
- Get to the ledge!

464
01:01:59,771 --> 01:02:04,740
- Ellie!
- Ellie, where are you?

465
01:02:04,776 --> 01:02:12,074
- It's okay, I'm up here.
- Hang on, Ellie. We'll be right there.

466
01:02:32,406 --> 01:02:35,745
Wait! Sloth down!

467
01:02:38,457 --> 01:02:45,651
Wait... Time out. Hold up.
Jeez, you guys are getting fast.

468
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:53,575
It's not so bad down here.
Nice weather, friendly neighbours.

469
01:02:59,727 --> 01:03:02,542
Hi, neighbour!

470
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:07,861
- Rudy...
- Rudy!

471
01:03:08,382 --> 01:03:10,572
- Never heard that kind of dino before.
- That's Sid.

472
01:03:10,597 --> 01:03:12,135
We'll have to move fast.

473
01:03:12,761 --> 01:03:14,748
Manny, pineapples!

474
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,729
- Pineapples?
- She gets cravings.

475
01:03:17,765 --> 01:03:22,459
- Pomegranates, grapefruits, nectarines.
- She's ordering a fruit cocktail.

476
01:03:23,188 --> 01:03:30,765
- Come on, think. Peaches!
- Peaches? Peaches!

477
01:03:30,801 --> 01:03:34,554
The baby!
What, what, what now!

478
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:38,101
- This not good.
- The baby is coming!

479
01:03:38,138 --> 01:03:42,810
- Can you try to hold it in!
- Can somebody slap him for me?

480
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:47,450
- Just sit tight, we're coming!
- There's only one thing to do.

481
01:03:47,486 --> 01:03:49,082
Opossums, you're with me.

482
01:03:49,094 --> 01:03:51,515
Manny, you take care of Ellie,
until we get back.

483
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:54,328
What? No, you can't leave now.
She's off the trail.

484
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:55,254
What about rule number 2?

485
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:58,956
Rule number 5 says, you can ignore
rule number 2, if there's a female involved.

486
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:03,750
Or possibly a cute dog. I just
make up these rules as I go along.

487
01:04:03,751 --> 01:04:05,211
Yeah, but, but, but...
She's... You have to!

488
01:04:05,732 --> 01:04:13,553
- Manny, it's alright. I got your back.
- Now you're talking. Come on, lads!

489
01:04:16,576 --> 01:04:21,129
- Take care of our sister, Mr.
- No pressure.

490
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:23,875
What does that mean, "I've got your back"?
I'd rather they cover the front.

491
01:04:24,397 --> 01:04:26,640
That's where all the
good stuff is, isn't it?

492
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:28,257
We gotta move!

493
01:04:33,156 --> 01:04:38,265
Okay! Alright. It's okay.
Daddy's, daddy's coming.

494
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:42,229
I gotta say sweet heart,
you really got timing...

495
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,941
Go away! Go away! Shoo!
Afraid of danger! Afraid of danger!

496
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:22,686
Don't worry, it's just lava. Deadly,

497
01:05:22,723 --> 01:05:25,918
Violent lava!

498
01:05:41,142 --> 01:05:44,061
- Boys, are you ready for adventure?
- Yes, sir!

499
01:05:44,165 --> 01:05:46,354
- For danger?
- Yes, sir!

500
01:05:46,355 --> 01:05:51,257
- For death!
- Uh, can you repeat the question?

501
01:06:02,101 --> 01:06:04,396
That's right. Come on!

502
01:06:06,794 --> 01:06:11,903
- Have you ever flown one of these before?
- No, first time actually.

503
01:06:18,995 --> 01:06:20,975
There she is.

504
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,956
- Ellie!
- Manny!

505
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,847
I need to get to her.

506
01:06:28,899 --> 01:06:32,133
Listen, I'll protect, Ellie.
You stop those guys.

507
01:06:32,169 --> 01:06:37,554
Manny, if they reach her, it'll
be to late. You have to trust me.

508
01:06:40,161 --> 01:06:42,871
Alright, let's do it.

509
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,037
My paws are burning, baby!
They burning!

510
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,121
I gotta tiptoe, tiptoe, tiptoe...

511
01:07:23,434 --> 01:07:30,175
- Excuse me, twinkle toes. Giving birth here.
- Oh, right. Sorry! You're okay?

512
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,548
Am I okay? Do you know
anything about child birth?

513
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,885
No, not really, but Manny's coming..

514
01:07:43,456 --> 01:07:49,608
- Diego, I'm scared! Can I hold your paw?
- Yeah, of course...

515
01:07:49,644 --> 01:07:54,820
Just go with the pain.
It's just a contraction.

516
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,974
- Look! He's right there.
- Roger!

517
01:08:09,984 --> 01:08:12,823
- No, Sid.
- I know. Roger!

518
01:08:12,859 --> 01:08:16,720
How about we get Sid first,
and then go back for Roger.

519
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:19,117
Oh, never mind.

520
01:08:29,754 --> 01:08:31,944
Oh, Buck.

521
01:08:46,541 --> 01:08:52,901
- Wait, wait! Sid's that way!
- Tell that to them.

522
01:08:54,151 --> 01:08:56,656
Bring it on, you chicken headed freaks!

523
01:09:14,694 --> 01:09:19,179
Don't worry about a thing.
You're doing fine.

524
01:09:19,216 --> 01:09:23,974
It's going great.
Ah, excuse me.

525
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:29,256
- Just keep breathing.
- Diego!

526
01:09:29,293 --> 01:09:32,630
Just breathe, that's the important thing.

527
01:09:40,138 --> 01:09:42,638
Grab that ammo.

528
01:09:45,455 --> 01:09:48,687
- Bogey at 3 o'clock.
- Fire!

529
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:00,680
This is awesome!

530
01:10:02,659 --> 01:10:05,058
Light it up!

531
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:07,980
- Yeah!
- Hasta la vista, birdie!

532
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:22,473
Let's get our...

533
01:10:23,409 --> 01:10:29,770
Mayday! Mayday!
We're losing altitude! Hold these.

534
01:10:31,647 --> 01:10:37,278
- That tastes like fish.
- Okay. That's just weird.

535
01:10:37,591 --> 01:10:40,198
- I love you, bro!
- I know!

536
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,796
Snap out of it, come on! Pull!

537
01:10:54,258 --> 01:10:58,134
This is the end of Sid, the sloth.

538
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,519
- Help!
- No, Sid. It's me.

539
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:09,709
- And me!
- And me!

540
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:13,671
I don't want to panic anybody,
but who's flying this thing?

541
01:11:26,496 --> 01:11:29,208
No, no, wait, my kids!

542
01:11:31,919 --> 01:11:35,464
I never even got to say goodbye.

543
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:42,712
- You can do it. Push! Push!
- I can't do it.

544
01:11:42,713 --> 01:11:44,329
Just one more big push.

545
01:11:44,849 --> 01:11:51,000
You have no idea what I'm going through.
Okay forget I said that. Let's do this together.

546
01:12:00,801 --> 01:12:06,171
I liked you guys better,
when you were extinct.

547
01:12:06,381 --> 01:12:10,082
Oh, I'm getting dizzy.

548
01:12:12,168 --> 01:12:16,443
Manny. Come on buddy.
I think we're getting close.

549
01:12:51,271 --> 01:12:58,324
She's perfect.
I think we should call her, Ellie.

550
01:12:58,361 --> 01:13:03,130
- Little, Ellie...
- I've got a better name... Peaches.

551
01:13:03,131 --> 01:13:04,721
Peaches?

552
01:13:04,757 --> 01:13:11,813
Why not? She's sweet, and round,
and covered with furs.

553
01:13:12,543 --> 01:13:15,046
I love it.

554
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,716
I saw that, tough guy.

555
01:13:18,718 --> 01:13:20,781
No, no, that last dino
caught my eye with a claw and...

556
01:13:20,886 --> 01:13:28,185
- Alright, so I'm not made of stone.
- Incoming!

557
01:13:28,221 --> 01:13:30,268
It's Sid!

558
01:13:34,127 --> 01:13:35,327
Oh, it's a boy!

559
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:38,507
- That's its tail.
- It's a girl.

560
01:13:38,924 --> 01:13:42,939
Hi, sweetheart!
It's uncle Sid... Yes, it is.

561
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:46,534
Oh, you're so beautiful.
Oh, she is...

562
01:13:46,639 --> 01:13:50,497
She looks just like her mother.
Thank goodness!

563
01:13:50,602 --> 01:13:53,521
Oh, no offence, Manny. No offence.
You're beautiful on the inside.

564
01:13:53,939 --> 01:13:55,921
It's good to have you back, Sid.

565
01:13:56,025 --> 01:14:01,656
Never thought I would say
this, but... I missed you, buddy.

566
01:14:04,365 --> 01:14:10,520
Now I wish my kids were here.
You could have been friends.

567
01:14:10,557 --> 01:14:12,709
Ellie!

568
01:14:15,419 --> 01:14:21,153
- I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
- I didn't.

569
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,285
I forgot what it was like
to be part of a family.

570
01:14:27,286 --> 01:14:31,164
What about you? Ever
thought about having kids?

571
01:14:33,874 --> 01:14:38,465
Alright, mammal's. Let's get you home.

572
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:08,139
This is it, mammal's. Right where
you started. This was fun.

573
01:16:08,176 --> 01:16:12,726
- We could make it a regular thing.
- I don't know about that.

574
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:18,842
Right, Right. Yes cos' of all
the uh, mortal peril. Of-Course.

575
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:23,779
- Oh, well, the Buck stops here!
- We couldn't have done it without you.

576
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:28,787
Well obviously. But, good
times just the same...

577
01:16:29,203 --> 01:16:32,539
We're not alone, are we?

578
01:16:35,668 --> 01:16:38,066
Hello, Rudy!

579
01:16:46,094 --> 01:16:48,598
Run!

580
01:16:54,228 --> 01:16:59,441
Over here you colossal, fossil!
Looking for something?

581
01:17:01,108 --> 01:17:06,530
Why don't you come and
get it? To the cave! Go!

582
01:17:07,783 --> 01:17:12,266
- Stay with the baby.
- We'll be fine. Go!

583
01:17:18,314 --> 01:17:20,505
Wuss!

584
01:17:32,182 --> 01:17:34,372
Pop, goes the weasel!

585
01:17:45,113 --> 01:17:48,971
Shoo, shoo! Come on! Move!

586
01:17:50,326 --> 01:17:53,348
Diego... Catch!

587
01:18:03,569 --> 01:18:07,688
Through the hole, over the valley.
One more loop...

588
01:18:07,794 --> 01:18:09,931
Come on, lads! Heev!

589
01:18:23,695 --> 01:18:27,866
Better luck next time, snowflake.
This isn't gonna hold him long. Let's go!

590
01:18:28,075 --> 01:18:30,577
Hold up, guys!

591
01:18:52,265 --> 01:18:54,872
Way to go, Mom-Zilla!

592
01:19:26,258 --> 01:19:30,949
Come here, kids. Well let me tell you
something. You're where you belong now.

593
01:19:30,986 --> 01:19:36,373
And I'm sure you're gonna grow
up to be giant, horrifying dinosaurs.

594
01:19:36,409 --> 01:19:38,875
Just like your mother.

595
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:43,010
Momma...

596
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:46,695
...take good care of our kids.

597
01:20:13,284 --> 01:20:16,153
- You were a good parent, Sid.
- Thanks!

598
01:20:16,189 --> 01:20:19,020
- Can I baby-sit for you?
- Not a chance.

599
01:20:19,542 --> 01:20:23,295
- Oh, come on! I work cheap.
- Alright. I'll think about it.

600
01:20:23,817 --> 01:20:27,778
- Yes!
- Never happened.

601
01:20:30,804 --> 01:20:35,600
- He's gone. What am I supposed to do now?
- That's easy.

602
01:20:36,018 --> 01:20:41,440
- Come with us.
- You mean... up there?

603
01:20:42,274 --> 01:20:47,763
I never thought of going back. I've been
down here so long, it feels like up to me.

604
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,055
I'm not sure I can fit-in
up there anymore.

605
01:20:51,056 --> 01:20:55,934
So, look at us.
We look like a normal herd to you?

606
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:58,123
Ouch!

607
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:25,756
So long, big guy!

608
01:21:36,704 --> 01:21:40,042
That's our queue. Come on, Peaches.

609
01:21:40,459 --> 01:21:42,648
He's alive.

610
01:21:43,586 --> 01:21:45,880
Buck...

611
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:50,155
- I... I gotta...
- Yeah...

612
01:21:50,468 --> 01:21:55,681
Besides this world should
really stay down here.

613
01:21:56,098 --> 01:22:01,210
- Take care of 'em, tiger.
- "Always listen to, Buck. "

614
01:22:01,246 --> 01:22:03,711
We're almost out.

615
01:22:33,012 --> 01:22:38,015
- Is everybody okay?
- Where's Buck?

616
01:22:39,268 --> 01:22:43,819
Don't worry.
He's where he wants to be.

617
01:22:43,855 --> 01:22:45,649
Is he going to be okay?

618
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:48,339
Are you kidding?
Nothing can kill that weasel.

619
01:22:48,376 --> 01:22:51,676
It's Rudy I'm worried about.

620
01:23:02,001 --> 01:23:08,673
I know this baby thing isn't for you.
But whatever you decide to do...

621
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:13,329
I'm not leaving, buddy.
Life of adventure... It's right here.

622
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:16,995
Well, I got a whole speech here.
I've been working on it.

623
01:23:16,996 --> 01:23:19,414
How can I show
you that I'm strong and...

624
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:23,376
...sensitive? Noble, yet caring?

625
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:26,398
Thanks!

626
01:23:40,164 --> 01:23:44,232
Ah, they grow so fast, huh?
Look at my kids.

627
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,359
Seems they were born one
day and then gone the next.

628
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:51,740
- They were, Sid.
- Yeah, it was a lot of work.

629
01:24:03,103 --> 01:24:07,692
It's right, sweetheart.
Welcome to the Ice Age.
