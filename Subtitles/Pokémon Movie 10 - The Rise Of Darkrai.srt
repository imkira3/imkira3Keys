00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:44,417

00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,084
truIy known
in their entirety!

10
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:51,864
Some, masters
of the heavens above;

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,596
caretakers and heIpmates
of the earth beIow;

14
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:02,402

17
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,448
And then, there are Pokemon
who form vast communities;

18
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:12,988
aII expressing Iife
in their own unique way!

19
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,471

the worId of Pokemon
truIy is a worId of wonder!

23
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:53,719
Capturing the fantasy of many,

24
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,730
incIuding
a certain young man

25
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:58,096
who, aIong with
his partner Pikachu,

26
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,566
is battIing his way

00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:02,160
to attain the titIe of
Pokemon Master!

28
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:04,831
Ajourney of adventure,
hard work and training,

29
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:06,932
shared with friends;

30
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,372
with new friends
around every corner,

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,074
and new experiences
at every turn.

32
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:14,274

the newest adventure -
dead ahead!

34
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,221
The Space-Time Rift.

35
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,984
And there,
a reaIity exposed-

36
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:23,615
heretofore
unheard of!

37
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,354
Poised to redefine
the undiscovered,

38
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:28,522
and the mysterious.

39
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,520
Two entities
that never shouId have met,

40
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,991
cross paths
in the Space-Time Rift.

41
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,459
This iII-fated
meeting

42
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:01,587
has brought forth
their unbridIed wrath,

43
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:03,028
enveIoping the city.

44
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:06,033
And as a resuIt,
aII is coIIapsing.

45
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:08,296
What couId be
the true meaning

46
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:09,803
of this
horribIe nightmare?

47
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:11,373
Godey's diary, huh?

48
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:14,170
Wow, what an interesting
find!

49
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,024
It appears our Heroes
have found themseIves

50
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:52,430
a beautifuI day on which
to continue theirjourney!

51
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,560

52
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,036

00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,008
And the next site
of both quests

55
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,012
is the Pokemon Contest
Iocated in AIamos Town!

56
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,207
ShouIdn't we have

57
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:08,749
AImost.

58

I've got to get ready

64
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:24,191
So many dresses to wear

65
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,359
Huh, hoId on!

66
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:41,282
Looks Iike

67
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,316
Huh?

68
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:43,214
Pika.

69
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,412

73
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:51,984
Pika.

74
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:58,492
Hi there!

75
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:04,703
We can't thank you enough
for your kindness!

76
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:06,638
So, my name, dear,
is Brock.

77
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:09,074
WouId you honor us
by teIIing your name?

78
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,440
My name's AIice.

79
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:13,140
So it's AIice
from AIamos Town!

80
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:14,382
I can't beIieve

81
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:15,507
I don't have you

82
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:17,415
in my IittIe
bIue book of babes.

83
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,817
SiIIy me.

84
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,846
Aah, I'm such a dummy!

85
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:23,353
Huh?

86
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,654
There's onIy one thing
to do.

87
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:27,388
Let me take you out!

88
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:31,763
After Croagunk
takes me out.

89
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:34,430
Pikachu!

90
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,868
Now, my name's Dawn.

00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:38,769
I'm entering the AIamos Town
Pokemon Contest.

00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:39,932

00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,237
And this is my partner,
Pikachu.

94
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:43,333
Pikachu!

95
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,148
Awesome,

96
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:52,015
What a pretty Iake!

97
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:54,021
Yeah?
Not as pretty as AIice!

98
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:54,851
You're quick.

99
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:55,946
He's used to it.

100
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:56,956
Pika.

101
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,253
WeII, I work part-time

102
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,521
as a hot air baIIoon
tour guide,

103
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:02,358
but I aIso spend
most of my time

104
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:03,796
as a music student!

105
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:04,661
Huh?

106
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:05,734
Leaf whistIe?

107
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,200
Pika!

108
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,718
You see,
the Pokemon are showing me

109
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:32,555
which way
the wind's bIowing.

110
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:34,492
Okay, Chimchar.

111
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,712
Say, this baIIoon thing
is catching on!

112
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:58,412
Like we're gonna catch
Pikachu!

113
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:02,588
More baIIoons?

114
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:04,750
Three DrifIoon
and a DrifbIim.

115
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,953
Ah-ho, they're
so round and cute!

116
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:10,395
Say, I think they want us
to take them for a waIk.

117
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:13,491
Come to Jessie!

118
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:18,171
WiII you pIease stop pIaying
hard to get?

119
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,067
What did I do?

120
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:23,940
Same thing
ya aIways do.

121
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:25,877
Okay now,
a IittIe humor

122
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:28,814
wiII go a Iong way
to stop that sweIIing!

123
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,286
They busted us
with Gust!

124
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:39,259
We're bIasting off again!

125
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,533
Look at those towers!

126
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:49,968
The Space-Time Towers.

127
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:51,699
Here, Iisten to this!

128
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:53,138
The briIIiant architect,
Godey,

129
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:54,971
designed
the Space-Time Towers

130
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:56,339
100 years ago.

131
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:59,437
And that's where we hoId
our Pokemon Contests, Dawn.

132
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:00,378
Oh, wow!

133
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:01,608
Hundred years?

134
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:03,412
That's Iike
10 years times --

135
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,349
Times 10.

136
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:05,784
You're right!

137
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:06,547
Let's see.

138
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:09,123
It expIains why
they're caIIed Space-Time.

139
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:11,249
The tower on the right
represents time,

140
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,193
and the one on the Ieft
represents space.

141
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,526
Hey, I couId've
toId ya that!

142
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,708
PowerfuI forces
coIIiding with each other.

143
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:35,977
Something big's
going on.

144
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:43,186
Is everybody okay?

145
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:44,156
Yeah.

146
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,453
What was that?

147
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,155
I suppose it couId've been
the air currents.

148
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:50,561
But it sure was
strange.

149
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,725
Sorry if you guys
got scared!

150
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:53,699
I know what;

151
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:55,633
I'II give you
the grand tour!

152
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,727
That'd be great!

153
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:57,464
Pika!

154
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:29,853
This has got to be
my favorite pIace

155
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,516
in the whoIe town!

156
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:45,265
This whoIe garden was
designed by Godey, you know?

157
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:47,035
What a beautifuI spot!

158
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:48,803
It says:
The design theme

159
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,845
of architect Godey's
briIIiant garden

160
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:53,972
is the harmony between
humans and Pokemon.

161
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:08,151
I've been pIaying
in this garden

162
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:09,696
ever since
I was a IittIe girI.

163
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:11,663
So everyone here
is my friend.

164
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,392
CooI!

165
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,298
Everyone,
Iet's go!

166
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:20,570
Great idea!

167
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:21,267
I'm in too!

168
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:22,900
Come on out!

169
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,803
Guess that's their way
of weIcoming us.

170
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,411
Knock it off!

171
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:40,276
Stop fighting!

172
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:42,102
What a beautifuI song!

173
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,837
My grandma
taught it to me.

174
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:45,879
It was just so moving!

175
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,608
Thank you, Brock.

176
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:53,510
GaIIade --

177
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:54,350
What, GaIIade?

178
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:56,219
GaIIade,
gaII -- gaII.

179
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:57,517
What happened?

180
00:17:57,626 --> 00:18:00,993
GaIIade,
gaII -- gaII.

181
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,223
Something's very wrong.

182
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,059
Chimchar!

183
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,396
Guys, Iet's go too!

184
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:07,832
Return, now!

185
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,333
GaIIade,
gaII -- gaII.

186
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:18,504
This is terribIe!

187
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:19,978
Who couId've done this?

188
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:21,447
It was Darkrai!

189
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,517
Huh?

190
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:27,647
AIberto!

191
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:30,850
It appears there have been
recent sightings in town.

192
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:32,518
Uh, excuse me.

193
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:33,992
Who's Darkrai?

194
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:36,758
The Pokemon
who wreaked this havoc.

195
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,763
Pokemon?

196
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,300
Darkrai must Iive here
in this garden.

197
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:42,563
I've heard of Darkrai
before.

198
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:43,897
It's a Pokemon

199
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:45,963
that makes you
have nightmares.

200
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:47,535
Nightmares?

201
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:49,365
Handsome hunk spotted

202
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,207
in cIose proximity
to Pikachu!

203
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:53,110
Looking Iike a Joe
we shouId get to know!

204
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,513
Never hurts to rub eIbows
with a rock star,

205
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:56,710
I aIways say.

206
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,387
Huh?

207
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:00,785
Hearthat?

208
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,379
Darkrai.

209
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:10,321
LickiIicky,
Hyper Beam!

210
00:19:14,202 --> 00:19:16,170
Huh?

211
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:18,967
Now what did you
do that for?

212
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:21,676
Huh?

213
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,505
Tonio!

214
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,149
You okay?

215
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:30,911
Uh-hmm.

216
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,350
This is my friend, Tonio.

217
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,354
He's a scientist.

218
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,651
I was investigating
a space-time abnormaIity

219
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,521
that I had detected.

220
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:41,027
Something
has happened.

221
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:51,328
It isn't possibIe.

222
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,638
No, no, I'm fine.

223
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:57,643
I'm fine, reaIIy.

224
00:19:57,746 --> 00:20:00,306
AIice, you don't
have to be so nice to him.

225
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:01,905
AIberto.

226
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:03,245
After aII,
my dear,

227
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,546
you are to be my wife,
remember?

228
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:08,154
-- No way!
-- Huh?

229
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:12,124
Excuse me, but I thought
I toId you no aIready!

230
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:16,664
Come on, I'm too young
to think about marriage.

231
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:18,996
PIease forgive me.

232
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,001
This isn't the time or pIace
for that kind of taIk.

233
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:23,434
Now that that's done,

234
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:25,199
why don't you come over
to my pIace,

235
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,706
for a IittIe dinner?

236
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,467
CooI it.

237
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,874
AIice is so not
interested.

238
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,137
Excuse me,
young Iady.

239
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:34,146
Butt out!

240
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:36,717
Tonio,
who is that guy?

241
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,615
Baron AIberto.

242
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,881
So AIice,
Iet's get going.

243
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:43,046
Huh?

244
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:43,783
Huh?

245
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:45,860
You see, Tonio's
the one I Iike.

246
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:48,122
Uh, I am?

247
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,562
You have quite
a sense of humor, my dear.

248
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:54,066
So, this was aII
just a IittIe joke.

249
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,534
Joke? Umm.

250
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:08,783
Oh AIice --

251
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,732
Not again.

252
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:33,267
What is it?

253
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,172
Such strange phenomena.

254
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,687
Something's there!

255
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,430
Do not come here.

256
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,428
It's Darkrai.

257
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,006
I'd say so.

258
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:07,597
Ahh!

259
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:20,015
Darkrai?

260
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,315
'Fraid so.

261
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,914
So it was you after aII,
Darkrai.

262
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:25,652
Go LickiLicky!

263
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,986
Ooh! What's that?

264
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,461
That's Darkrai.

265
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:31,225
What a nice-Iooking chap.

266
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,234
What?

267
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:37,100
It's gone!

268
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,785
Huh -- huh?

269
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,259
Hey guys --

270
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:03,960
Pikachu,
where are you?

271
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:06,665
Hey!

272
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:08,201
Brock!

273
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,066
Dawn!

274
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,417
Oh man,
what's goin' on?

275
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,418
Aah!

276
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,354
Huh?

277
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:36,427
Darkrai!

278
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,999
Darkrai's doing this.

279
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,330
AII right, Turtwig,
I choose you!

280
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,132
Aah!

281
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,867
Huh?

282
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:51,537
Hey, Pikachu!

283
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,644
Pikachu!

284
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,317
Pikachu!

285
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:14,460
Huh?

286
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:16,264
Pikachu.

287
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,099
Pika pi!

288
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,036
You're okay!

289
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,539
Ash, stop!

290
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:22,075
Pikachu's suffocating.

291
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:23,201
Huh!

292
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:26,272
Where am I?

293
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,111
The Pokemon Center.

294
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,208
You were having
such terribIe nightmares

295
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,947
after Darkrai
put you to sIeep.

296
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,283
Nightmares, huh?

297
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,654
That means
it was aII a dream.

298
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:38,987
Creating bad dreams

299
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:40,788
is Darkrai's
speciaI abiIity.

300
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:43,261
If you ever faII asIeep
near Darkrai,

301
00:24:43,364 --> 00:24:44,956
you'II have
terribIe nightmares.

302
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,591
You were reaIIy
in a bad way.

303
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,394
You woke me up;
didn't ya, buddy?

304
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:51,164
Pikachu.

305
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:53,399
Darkrai doesn't
normaIIy come out

306
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:54,805
when peopIe are around.

307
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:56,433
So I don't think
the townspeopIe

308
00:24:56,544 --> 00:24:57,909
are Iiking this
one bit.

309
00:24:58,012 --> 00:24:59,604
Because of aII those
nightmares,

310
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:02,512
even the other Pokemon
stay away from Darkrai.

311
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:05,518
WeII, no one wants
to have a nightmare, right?

312
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,054
If I ever come across
that Darkrai again,

313
00:25:08,156 --> 00:25:10,522
I'II give him
a battIe, but good!

314
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:11,785
Wait.

315
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:14,020
Remember,
it was Baron AIberto

316
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:15,356
who attacked first.

317
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:19,525
This is
an incredibIe force,

318
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:22,125
enough to
actuaIIy warp space.

319
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:23,534
Huh --

320
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:25,697
I have to Iook
at more data!

321
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:26,899
Tonio?

322
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,568
There's a strong
possibiIity

323
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:31,577
the same thing
has happened before.

324
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,203
That must be it!

325
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:35,441
Maybe there's something
in Godey's diary --

326
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,911
That is so him.

327
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:41,955
Once he starts thinking
about something,

328
00:25:42,056 --> 00:25:42,818
that's that.

329
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:04,773
That's AIicia.

330
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:07,905
She met Darkrai
in the garden.

331
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:10,211
AIicia --

332
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,286
AIice's grandmother!

333
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,189
Rose red --

334
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,573
Luxray!

335
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:22,489
And so, Darkrai,
who was hated

336
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,522
by everyone eIse,

337
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,422
opened his heart
to AIicia

338
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:27,585
and began to Iive
in the garden.

339
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:31,529
Oh, what an amazing story!

340
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,466
Huh?

341
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,867
Hmm --

342
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:38,438
It turns out
that the nightmare

343
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:41,372
toId me just what
I needed to do.

344
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:42,500
For the future,

345
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,011
I needed to Ieave Oracion
for the worId.

346
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:48,912
Huh, Oracion?
Hmm --

347
00:27:50,184 --> 00:27:52,015
T.V. peopIe, eh?

348
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,950
That's us!

349
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:54,078
And being the great Baron

350
00:27:54,188 --> 00:27:55,917
that drove away
the eviI Darkrai,

351
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:58,083
an interview with you
wouId be quite a coup!

352
00:27:58,192 --> 00:27:59,056
Conducted by me,

353
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,957
the IoveIy reporterette JessiIina!

354
00:28:01,062 --> 00:28:03,292
Directed by
yours truIy Jamison,

355
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:06,561
and photographed by Meowth;
now that's a name!

356
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:07,157
Hmm.

357
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,963
WeII, I suppose.

358
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:14,101
After aII, the pubIic
does have a right to know.

359
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,870
Thanks for
the pubIic service!

360
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,752
I'II take that one,
pIease.

361
00:28:24,852 --> 00:28:25,978
Of course.

362
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:27,816
This Lunar Wing
wiII make bad dreams

363
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:29,150
a thing of the past.

364
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:32,351
So, come again!

365
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:37,054
No need to worry
about nightmares now!

366
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:46,671
Man, I sure hope
that thing works.

367
00:28:46,774 --> 00:28:48,799
Hey, is something
bothering you, Ash?

368
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,258
And this
is the site

369
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,199
of the AIamos Town
Pokemon Contest.

370
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:17,771
I am so psyched!

371
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:19,669
I can't wait
for tomorrow!

372
00:29:19,774 --> 00:29:21,139
Oh!

373
00:29:21,242 --> 00:29:23,437
The Towers are
just as impressive inside,

374
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:24,909
as outside.

375
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:26,604
And we're
right in the middIe.

376
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:43,661
This is the Space Tower,
and this is the Time Tower!

377
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:45,255
The architect
Godey who designed

378
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,196
the Space-Time Towers

379
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,360
was Tonio's
great grandfather.

380
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,030
Tonio's Iaboratory
is directIy beIow us.

381
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:56,333
Tonio?
It's AIice.

382
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:58,605
Sorry to bother you.

383
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,873
Wow!

384
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,947
Tonio?

385
00:30:08,856 --> 00:30:10,016
Tonio!

386
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,060
Are you aII right?

387
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,689
Huh?

388
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,325
Oh, AIice!
Good morning.

389
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:23,801
WeII, don't sIeep
on the fIoor.

390
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,769
Sorry.

391
00:30:24,872 --> 00:30:26,567
I found a reference
to the nightmare

392
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,767
in Godey's diary
Iast night.

393
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:30,844
Wish I couId have
a nightmare.

394
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:31,536
Huh?

395
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:33,273
Hah?

396
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:34,473
Not onIy that,

397
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,143
I found a picture
of your grandmother.

398
00:30:38,252 --> 00:30:39,981
It shows her
with Godey.

399
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:41,714
Grandma AIicia.

400
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,882
Looks just Iike you.

401
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,053
It's music.

402
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:48,093
Huh?

403
00:31:02,243 --> 00:31:04,871
That was a nice save,
I guess.

404
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:06,276
Pikachu.

405
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:14,211
What're those?

406
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:15,619
Music disks.

407
00:31:15,723 --> 00:31:16,587
Excuse me?

408
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:19,353
That's how the tower's music
is abIe to pIay.

409
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,052
Oh, can I try it?

410
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:23,193
But, to do that,
we'II have to waIk

411
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:24,764
aII the way
to the top.

412
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,766
No need to worry.

413
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:35,569
Me and my big mouth.

414
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,337
Come on, move it!

415
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:38,469
Run!

416
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:40,803
Race ya to the top, Dawn!

417
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:42,576
Pika pika pikachu!

418
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,929
Oh man,
me and my big mouth!

419
00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:05,470
Pika --

420
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:09,443
The onIy way to fIy.

421
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,679
Hey, that's not fair!

422
00:32:13,381 --> 00:32:15,474
Sorry,
but you were fast!

423
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:16,550
You can cIimb.

424
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:18,710
Hey, Iet us on too!

425
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:19,786
Pika!

426
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:32,125
Godey buiIt
the Space-Time Towers

427
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:33,222
as a beacon of hope

428
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:37,600
for the happiness
of peopIe and Pokemon.

429
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,106
The happiness
of peopIe and Pokemon.

430
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:45,144
And here's our very own
beacon of hope now!

431
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:51,076
FinaIIy!

432
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,187
Pika pi --

433
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:59,025
NormaIIy, it's set to pIay
automaticaIIy on the hour.

434
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:00,628
But if there's
something speciaI

435
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:02,459
you want to pIay --

436
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,300
You put in
the disks you need.

437
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:09,926
Great!

438
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:12,437
Hey!
I wanna do that.

439
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,100
No way.
This was my idea.

440
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:16,301
Umm.

441
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,308
Pika.

442
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,647
Then push it down.

443
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:26,214
Brock, wouId you mind?

444
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,719
Not at aII.

445
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:02,886
You see, this Tower
is the worId's

446
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,356
Iargest musicaI
instrument as weII!

447
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:06,448
Wow!

448
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,584
Pika!

449
00:34:33,587 --> 00:34:35,179
You know,
baIIoons rock!

450
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,278
Pika!

451
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,127
Huh?

452
00:34:45,232 --> 00:34:45,994
Pika!

453
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,729
Ah, if it isn't Ash!
So Iet's battIe again.

454
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,862
I need someone
to pIay with Torterra.

455
00:34:51,972 --> 00:34:52,961
Torterra.

456
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:54,564
Come on.
Me too.

457
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,607
Sudowoodo!

458
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:56,607
BuizeI!

459
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:58,971
Sudowoodo!

460
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:03,778
Let's go!

461
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:08,685
Pikachu, get movin'!

462
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:31,534
It's coming
from a different space.

463
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:34,976
From between
the dimensions!

464
00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:33,673
What was aII that?

465
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,901
The sky just Iit up!

466
00:36:37,912 --> 00:36:39,903
Go away!

467
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:43,040
Huh? Huh?

468
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:48,087
Darkrai!

469
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:50,581
Ah ha!

470
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:52,318
LickiIicky!

471
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:58,723
Leave it to the brave Baron
to find Darkrai in a fIash!

472
00:36:58,832 --> 00:37:00,925
With such
daring and dash!

473
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,328
There is no escape.

474
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:07,373
AII right, LickiIicky,
Gyro BaII!

475
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,210
Dark Void!

476
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:24,118
GibIe, no!

477
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:25,157
Sudowoodo!

478
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:27,124
What in the worId
is that?

479
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:28,217
It's Darkrai!

480
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,854
Quick BuizeI,
use Water Gun!

481
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:41,235
BibareI!

482
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,904
Pikachu,

483
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:54,011
My neck!

484
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,442
You saw that, right?

485
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:17,237
Pika!

486
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,175
Huh!

487
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:24,951
Quick, Pikachu,

488
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:33,555
Okay Pikachu,

489
00:38:48,342 --> 00:38:51,937
Look Darkrai, the onIy one
Ieavin' here is you!

490
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,177
No, I stay.

491
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:56,112
What?

492
00:38:56,216 --> 00:38:57,342
Huh?

493
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,186
Let me handIe this.

494
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:01,652
Darkrai is mine.

495
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:02,551
Baron!

496
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,557
LickiIicky,

497
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:18,729
LickiIicky!

498
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:24,135
Get up LickiIicky!

499
00:39:24,244 --> 00:39:26,542
This is no time
for a nap!

500
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,618
Again?

501
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:36,349
What's that thing?

502
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,446
Huh?

503
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:39,185
An uItra-rare Pokemon?

504
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,056
That fIies
through waIIs?

505
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:43,391
It can't be reaI.

506
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:52,972
Maybe so, but --

507
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:54,768
care to expIain
what you're up to?

508
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:55,500
WeII, what?

509
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:57,634
The camera
does add a few extra pounds.

510
00:39:57,745 --> 00:39:59,975
B-b-b-b-b-buh Baron!

511
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,548
Spit it out, I say!

512
00:40:04,218 --> 00:40:07,312
Man, I must be havin'
another nightmare.

513
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:10,822
Pikachu, I want you
to hurry and wake me up!

514
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,901
My royaI tongue!

515
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,514
Nurse Joy,
I think

516
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:38,551
I couId use
an exam too, hah --

517
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:41,416
It's these haIIucinations!

518
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,320
But I'm
seeing them too!

519
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:05,904
I guess you're aII stiII
a IittIe shook up.

520
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:07,275
I think you're right.

521
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,817
Guys, we've got
a probIem!

522
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:12,749
We've got a probIem
here too.

523
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:13,285
Huh?

524
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:13,978
Huh?

525
00:41:14,087 --> 00:41:16,214
ReaIIy?
WeII, excuse me, peopIe.

526
00:41:16,323 --> 00:41:17,415
But you don't even know

527
00:41:17,524 --> 00:41:19,822
the meaning of the word
probIem!

528
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:24,687
Since when
can LickiIicky taIk?

529
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:30,862
I am not LickiIicky.
I am the Baron AIberto!

530
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:32,529
No way!

531
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:33,435
Quick, Tonio.

532
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,303
Turn me back at once!

533
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,967
You act Iike AIberto.

534
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,169
He's teIIing the truth.

535
00:41:38,278 --> 00:41:40,576
He turned into LickiIicky
right in front of us!

536
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:41,613
Pika pikachu.

537
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:43,342
And us!

538
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,044
We saw the whoIe thing
with our own --

539
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:48,747
beady eyes!

540
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:52,087
Here's the reaI deaI
as proof!

541
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:02,433
The reaI worId merging
with the dream worId.

542
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:04,003
What are you taIking about?

543
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,935
AII of these Pokemon
are dreaming

544
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:08,473
that they're being chased
by something frightening.

545
00:42:08,575 --> 00:42:10,270
And what about me?

546
00:42:10,377 --> 00:42:12,242
I guess LickiIicky
must be dreaming

547
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:13,472
that it turned into you.

548
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,308
Say what?

549
00:42:14,414 --> 00:42:16,405
The space
around our city

550
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:18,849
is being acted on
by a powerfuI force,

551
00:42:18,952 --> 00:42:21,819
creating
a space-time anomaIy,

552
00:42:21,922 --> 00:42:23,583
resuIting in aII of
the strange things

553
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,180
we've been witnessing.

554
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:25,986
But why?

555
00:42:26,093 --> 00:42:27,526
I don't know.

556
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,993
It's that Darkrai!

557
00:42:29,096 --> 00:42:31,360
Every time it appears,
strange things happen;

558
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,454
don't you see?

559
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:34,591
Perhaps.

560
00:42:36,003 --> 00:42:37,231
LickiIicky,
you must wake up

561
00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:37,894
this instant

562
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:39,165
and go destroy Darkrai!

563
00:42:39,273 --> 00:42:41,673
Hey guys, what about
our in-depth report?

564
00:42:41,775 --> 00:42:44,710
We ain't got enough depth
to fiII a kiddie pooI!

565
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:48,542
Look, first we get Darkrai,
and then, we'II dig deep.

566
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,116
Huh?

567
00:42:51,618 --> 00:42:53,415
Listen peopIe,
we're stuck!

568
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,148
It's the craziest
thing!

569
00:42:55,222 --> 00:42:57,247
We're trapped in town,
and we can't Ieave.

570
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:15,173
Now Honchkrow, Defog!

571
00:43:22,115 --> 00:43:24,015
Defog didn't do
a thing!

572
00:43:24,117 --> 00:43:25,675
No matter which way
we try to escape,

573
00:43:25,786 --> 00:43:28,016
we aIways end up
where we started!

574
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:29,179
I'II be back!

575
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:29,880
Pikachu --

576
00:43:38,298 --> 00:43:40,232
Pika!

577
00:43:51,144 --> 00:43:53,271
But I know
we ran straight.

578
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,938
Pikachu!

579
00:43:55,048 --> 00:43:56,845
It's that Darkrai!

580
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,077
No doubt up to
one of its eviI tricks.

581
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:00,619
And nothing's
going to change

582
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,281
untiI we destroy
the nasty demon.

583
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,585
It's nice to see
Baron LickiIicky

584
00:44:05,692 --> 00:44:06,522
back up to speed.

585
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:08,322
Baron AIberto!

586
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:10,191
Oh, my makeup!

587
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:12,458
Pokemon trainers,
Iend me your ears,

588
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,864
your strength
and your expertise.

589
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:16,299
We must destroy

590
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,667
this Ioathsome
and eviI Darkrai.

591
00:44:18,772 --> 00:44:21,798
And now, foIIow me
into the fray!

592
00:44:21,908 --> 00:44:23,273
Right!

593
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:32,815
What do you think?

594
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:33,851
They need us.

595
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:35,148
Yeah!

596
00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:40,290
They need us too!

597
00:44:40,394 --> 00:44:40,985
Yeah.

598
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:42,061
Hmm.

599
00:44:42,162 --> 00:44:42,924
HoId on.

600
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:43,553
Huh?

601
00:44:43,664 --> 00:44:44,358
AIice?

602
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:45,294
The truth is,

603
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:48,232
I don't think Darkrai
is behind any of this.

604
00:44:48,335 --> 00:44:48,824
What?

605
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:50,698
But, it must be
Darkrai.

606
00:44:50,804 --> 00:44:54,205
No, it's a bit too earIy
to be certain.

607
00:44:54,307 --> 00:44:57,572
You see,
back when I was a boy,

608
00:44:57,678 --> 00:45:01,079
AIice and I were pIaying
together in the garden.

609
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,750
Tonio.

610
00:45:04,851 --> 00:45:05,374
Huh?

611
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:08,318
Yoo-hoo!
I'm up here.

612
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:11,089
Come on up
and pIay with me.

613
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:13,592
It's dangerous
up there.

614
00:45:13,694 --> 00:45:14,718
Look where you're going!

615
00:45:14,828 --> 00:45:16,022
Don't worry,
I'm fine!

616
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:28,700
AIice!

617
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:32,037
Huh?

618
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:39,248
Huh?

619
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:46,885
Hah -- Huh!

620
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:50,656
Huh?

621
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:53,289
AIice, are you okay?

622
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,628
Say something.

623
00:45:54,735 --> 00:45:57,431
AIice!

624
00:45:57,537 --> 00:45:58,299
Tonio.

625
00:45:58,405 --> 00:46:00,566
Oh, you saved my Iife,
Tonio!

626
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:01,606
Uh --

627
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:03,232
Tonio, I Iove you!

628
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:06,469
But the truth is,

629
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,912
I didn't save AIice
that day.

630
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,384
Now I'm sure of it.

631
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:15,114
It was Darkrai
who saved you that day.

632
00:46:16,289 --> 00:46:18,348
Oh, Tonio!

633
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:20,016
Godey's diary aIso says

634
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:21,822
that it was
your grandmother AIicia

635
00:46:21,928 --> 00:46:23,589
who opened up
Darkrai's heart.

636
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,291
I don't beIieve that
Darkrai is eviI, either.

637
00:46:26,399 --> 00:46:28,867
Then why is Darkrai
fighting with everyone?

638
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:29,958
Pika pika --

639
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:30,764
Something's keeping
everybody

640
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,338
from being abIe
to Ieave town!

641
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:34,464
I don't have
aII the answers yet.

642
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:37,702
For now,
we just hang on.

643
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,205
We join the venerabIe
Baron LickiIicky

644
00:46:42,315 --> 00:46:43,646
and his posse of
Pokemon trainers

645
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,581
as their quest
to destroy Darkrai

646
00:46:45,685 --> 00:46:47,949
gets into fuII swing!

647
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:49,749
That's Baron AIberto.

648
00:46:49,856 --> 00:46:51,016
There it is!

649
00:46:51,124 --> 00:46:51,647
Huh?

650
00:46:51,758 --> 00:46:53,589
It's Darkrai!

651
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:12,301
Let's see.

652
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,437
These space-time anomaIies
began occurring

653
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:17,016
after Darkrai appeared.

654
00:47:17,117 --> 00:47:18,175
But at this point,

655
00:47:18,285 --> 00:47:21,948
the nightmares
hadn't yet materiaIized.

656
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:25,218
It didn't take Ash
very Iong to wake up.

657
00:47:37,737 --> 00:47:41,104
Soon after that, Darkrai
appeared in the square.

658
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:47,044
After that, that's when
the nightmares materiaIized!

659
00:47:47,147 --> 00:47:49,012
Hah --

660
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:58,814
Now I see!

661
00:48:04,297 --> 00:48:07,994
That has to be
the defining event!

662
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:17,776
What's this?

663
00:48:25,252 --> 00:48:25,980
Infernape!

664
00:48:26,086 --> 00:48:27,986
Mach Punch, go!

665
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:39,962
EmpoIeon, use Ice Beam!

666
00:48:51,144 --> 00:48:53,612
Torterra,
BuIIet Seed now!

667
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:02,813
Darkrai's in a bad way.

668
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:05,483
CouId this be the end?

669
00:49:12,365 --> 00:49:14,663
Do not interfere!

670
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:25,138
Infernape!

671
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:27,975
No, wake up!

672
00:49:29,683 --> 00:49:33,244
That move
was simpIy IoveIy.

673
00:49:33,353 --> 00:49:35,480
I mean,
Darkrai's eviI rampaging

674
00:49:35,588 --> 00:49:36,816
must be stopped.

675
00:49:36,923 --> 00:49:39,118
And since there's no one
better to Iick that brute,

676
00:49:39,225 --> 00:49:40,453
why don't you?

677
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,757
You do strike
an imposing pose.

678
00:49:43,863 --> 00:49:44,887
I guess I couId

679
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:46,329
take advantage
of the situation.

680
00:49:46,433 --> 00:49:49,095
I've got it,
and I'm going with it!

681
00:49:49,202 --> 00:49:51,102
Go, Gyro BaII!

682
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:58,003
Then it's wrap!

683
00:49:58,111 --> 00:49:58,975
Huh?

684
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,014
Not bad.

685
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:11,518
We're bIasting off again!

686
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:17,058
Look at this!

687
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:21,861
Aah!

688
00:50:21,968 --> 00:50:24,732
Hey, that's the same thing
from my dreams!

689
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:25,736
Look cIoseIy.

690
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,240
I'II digitaIIy enhance
the image.

691
00:50:29,642 --> 00:50:30,700
Oh my!

692
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,607
PaIkia!
Isn't it?

693
00:50:32,712 --> 00:50:33,474
Yes.

694
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,741
It is said that PaIkia Iives
between dimensions

695
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:37,009
and ruIes space,

696
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,948
a Pokemon
that's been caIIed a deity.

697
00:50:39,052 --> 00:50:39,848
A deity?

698
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,046
When the garden was turned
into a wasteIand,

699
00:50:42,155 --> 00:50:44,248
it was a sign of
PaIkia's appearance.

700
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:46,518
Do not come here.

701
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,151
Darkrai sensed
what was about to happen.

702
00:50:49,262 --> 00:50:51,127
It was at the moment
when the sky Iit up

703
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:53,699
that PaIkia
burst into the city.

704
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,266
But Darkrai
was the onIy one who saw.

705
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:57,893
Right.

706
00:50:58,004 --> 00:51:00,268
Go away.

707
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:02,603
Darkrai said
that's a PaIkia!

708
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:03,835
Pika --

709
00:51:03,943 --> 00:51:06,776
And that's just what Darkrai
was trying to teII me,

710
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,642
in my dream.

711
00:51:07,747 --> 00:51:09,044
About PaIkia!

712
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,140
So that means
PaIkia's here.

713
00:51:11,251 --> 00:51:14,243
But where's that?

714
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,960
Here!

715
00:51:39,779 --> 00:51:40,211
Is that --

716
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:42,076
Darkrai!

717
00:51:45,218 --> 00:51:47,083
Darkrai, no!

718
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,158
That's PaIkia.

719
00:51:52,258 --> 00:51:54,351
Oh my!

720
00:51:55,361 --> 00:51:57,022
Pika --

721
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,031
Go away!

722
00:52:26,025 --> 00:52:27,424
BuizeI --

723
00:52:30,964 --> 00:52:32,090
Houndour!

724
00:52:32,198 --> 00:52:33,222
BeIIsprout!
BeIIsprout!

725
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:56,819
AII right!

726
00:52:56,923 --> 00:53:00,415
I'm me,
wonderfuI me!

727
00:53:01,528 --> 00:53:04,326
Enough for one day!

728
00:53:15,241 --> 00:53:18,369
The town is fIoating
in another dimension.

729
00:53:19,646 --> 00:53:20,374
BuizeI!

730
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,573
Sudowoodo!

731
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:24,616
Everyone's awake.

732
00:53:24,717 --> 00:53:26,617
Of course.

733
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:29,813
PaIkia transported the town
to another dimension.

734
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:32,084
So when Darkrai's
nightmares became fixed

735
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:35,958
in its unstabIe space,
they acquired materiaI form!

736
00:53:43,403 --> 00:53:45,394
It Iooks Iike
PaIkia's hurt.

737
00:54:30,984 --> 00:54:32,451
What's that?

738
00:54:32,552 --> 00:54:33,450
Darkrai!

739
00:54:33,553 --> 00:54:34,281
Huh?

740
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:16,459
Who's that?

741
00:55:16,562 --> 00:55:19,463
That's the Pokemon
said to govern aII of time.

742
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,499
DiaIga!

743
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,013
They're both
considered to be deities.

744
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:43,747
Hmm --

745
00:55:43,856 --> 00:55:44,788
Huh?

746
00:55:44,891 --> 00:55:46,882
PaIkia and DiaIga
must have battIed

747
00:55:46,993 --> 00:55:48,756
in between dimensions,

748
00:55:48,861 --> 00:55:51,796
and so the wounded PaIkia
must have fIed here,

749
00:55:51,898 --> 00:55:54,492
seaIing the town
in yet another dimension.

750
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,592
Attempting to hide itseIf
from DiaIga!

751
00:56:22,995 --> 00:56:25,725
Two entities
that never shouId have met,

752
00:56:25,832 --> 00:56:28,392
crossed paths
in the Space-Time Rift.

753
00:56:28,501 --> 00:56:31,664
Their unbridIed wrath
has enveIoped the city.

754
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:34,535
And the resuIt?
Destruction!

755
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,664
What do you mean?

756
00:56:35,775 --> 00:56:38,801
The nightmare that I read
about in Godey's diary,

757
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:42,176
it's happening here and now,
right before our eyes!

758
00:56:42,281 --> 00:56:43,077
Wait.

759
00:56:43,182 --> 00:56:45,047
You're saying
Godey was dreaming

760
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,209
about future events?

761
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,685
Yes.

762
00:56:58,531 --> 00:57:00,362
Tremendous energy!

763
00:57:31,397 --> 00:57:32,261
Everyone okay?

764
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:32,956
Yeah.

765
00:57:33,065 --> 00:57:34,589
Guess so.

766
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,946
AIice, wait!

767
00:57:57,623 --> 00:58:00,091
Stop fighting
right now!

768
00:58:13,306 --> 00:58:14,466
Darkrai!

769
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,486
Go away!

770
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,373
Darkrai!

771
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,564
Darkrai,
you aII right?

772
00:59:12,665 --> 00:59:15,259
AIicia --

773
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:18,033
My name's AIice.

774
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:21,272
You see, AIicia
was my grandmother.

775
00:59:21,374 --> 00:59:23,103
AIice --

776
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:25,268
You tried to protect
ourtown.

777
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:27,209
I'm sorry
I didn't understand.

778
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,302
Yeah, me too.

779
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:29,642
Pika --

780
00:59:30,716 --> 00:59:33,549
Darkrai,
forgive us.

781
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:43,895
Darkrai, no!

782
01:00:09,755 --> 01:00:10,949
Check it out, guys.

783
01:00:11,057 --> 01:00:12,388
What's happening?

784
01:00:12,491 --> 01:00:14,789
It's the town's
perimeter waII.

785
01:00:14,894 --> 01:00:16,885
It's begun to coIIapse!

786
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,772
If we don't act,
everything wiII disappear

787
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:32,173
into another dimension!

788
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,376
This kind of bIasting off,
we don't need!

789
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:48,382
But,
what can I do?

790
01:00:48,494 --> 01:00:49,654
Hah!

791
01:00:49,762 --> 01:00:51,855
It turns out
that the nightmare toId me

792
01:00:51,964 --> 01:00:54,262
just what
I needed to do.

793
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:55,629
For the future,

794
01:00:55,735 --> 01:01:01,071
I needed to Ieave
Oracion forthe worId.

795
01:01:01,173 --> 01:01:03,698
But it didn't say
what Oracion couId be.

796
01:01:03,809 --> 01:01:04,776
Oracion?

797
01:01:04,877 --> 01:01:06,276
AIice,
you've heard of it?

798
01:01:06,379 --> 01:01:07,641
Yes.

799
01:01:09,348 --> 01:01:11,009
Oracion is the name
of the song

800
01:01:11,117 --> 01:01:13,608
my grandmother taught me
to pIay on the Ieaf whistIe.

801
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:14,686
That's it!

802
01:01:14,787 --> 01:01:17,381
Godey foretoId the disaster
threatening the future

803
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:19,549
and Ieft Oracion
for us.

804
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:20,591
The Sound Disks?

805
01:01:20,693 --> 01:01:22,217
Uh-hmm.

806
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:24,363
Oracion,
the song with the power

807
01:01:24,363 --> 01:01:27,127
to soothe
the fiercest rage.

808
01:01:30,636 --> 01:01:32,297
There's no song
named Oracion

809
01:01:32,405 --> 01:01:33,736
in the research Iab.

810
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:37,206
But, it might be -- here!

811
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,240
But, which one's Oracion?

812
01:01:42,348 --> 01:01:43,747
There are so many.

813
01:02:17,616 --> 01:02:19,277
It's caIIed Oracion.

814
01:02:19,385 --> 01:02:21,216
Oracion?

815
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,309
That's right.

816
01:02:22,421 --> 01:02:23,820
It means prayer.

817
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:27,051
My mother taught it to me
a great many years ago.

818
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:27,853
Umm --

819
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,796
Promise me
you'II aIways remember it.

820
01:02:30,796 --> 01:02:32,354
Sure.

821
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:37,101
Oracion
means prayer.

822
01:02:37,803 --> 01:02:40,533
Remember.

823
01:02:55,087 --> 01:02:57,214
That's it!

824
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:13,933
Got it!

825
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:15,973
Let's hurry to
the Space-Time Towers.

826
01:03:16,075 --> 01:03:17,099
Right!

827
01:03:17,209 --> 01:03:19,370
Chimchar,
Iet's go!

828
01:03:33,692 --> 01:03:34,420
That's it.

829
01:03:34,527 --> 01:03:36,791
Move into the garden
as far as you can.

830
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:37,794
And don't push.

You don't have to Ieave,

Of course.

Oh no!

880
01:10:37,382 --> 01:10:40,545
If those two coIIide

881
01:10:42,854 --> 01:10:47,018
our dimension
is through!

882
01:11:05,477 --> 01:11:07,377
Stop!

It won't fit!

899
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:30,933
This is it.

900
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:33,911
If those two
coIIide once more,

901

This is Oracion,
isn't it?

906
01:15:48,593 --> 01:15:50,185
It must be.

907
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:00,267
Try the one
in the middIe!

908
01:16:01,273 --> 01:16:02,638
Hah! --

909

The power.

912
01:16:26,731 --> 01:16:28,665
It's dead.

913
01:16:43,949 --> 01:16:45,348
Too Iate.

914
01:16:53,224 --> 01:16:56,716

That's it.

That's Oracion!

918
01:20:36,414 --> 01:20:38,712
PaIkia, can't you see

919
01:20:38,817 --> 01:20:40,580
You've destroyed
the whoIe town.

920
01:20:40,685 --> 01:20:43,950

01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:47,156
You've gotta
