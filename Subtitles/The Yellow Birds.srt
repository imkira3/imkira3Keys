<i>The war tried
to kill us in the spring.</i>

4
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,386
<i>And the summer.</i>

5
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,724
<i>It tried to kill us every day.</i>

6
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:08,324
<i>It didn't explain itself.</i>

7
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:10,494
<i>It didn't tell us why
it brought us there</i>

8
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,231
<i>or what it wanted.</i>

9
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:14,898
<i>It just took.</i>

10
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:23,373
<i>It killed some of us before
we knew we were dead.</i>

11
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,309
<i>Pretty soon it was hard
to tell who was alive</i>

12
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,447
<i>and who was just a ghost.</i>

13
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:32,318
<i>We lost Murph
somewhere in there.</i>

14
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,918
<i>Not really sure when.</i>

15
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,891
<i>Even before we lost
him, he was gone.</i>

16
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,697
<i>I wish the truth were different
than what I remembered.</i>

17
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:49,836
<i>I wish I could find an
order that made sense.</i>

18
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,375
Conceal and carry, baby.

19
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:00,280
Conceal and carry.

20
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,280
It's gonna take courage
to win this war.

21
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:05,315
Definitely.

22
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:16,459
She's into you, Murph.

23
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:17,496
Nah.

24
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:21,700
- You like her?
- No.

25
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,872
Go dance with her.

26
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:28,473
I can't.

27
00:03:29,974 --> 00:03:31,340
Whatever.

28
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:32,542
I'm not a good dancer.

29
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:34,043
So just dance.

30
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:35,281
Hi!

31
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,282
Hi! Where you going?

32
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:41,451
Hi, sorry.

33
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,387
He'll get to it.
He's shy.

34
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,588
Yeah.

35
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,322
You're embarrassing me.

36
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:47,858
You're embarrassing
yourself, dude.

37
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,858
Come on.

38
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,026
Come on!

39
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:51,394
Yeah, baby.

40
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:52,461
Fucking move!

41
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:54,430
Now move! Move!

42
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:55,598
- Incoming!
- Move!

43
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,966
Fucking move, go!

44
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:02,508
Oh, shit!

45
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:04,907
All right, let's go!

46
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:09,348
Guys, guys...

47
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:19,891
That was pretty close, huh?

48
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:26,396
<i>Yellow
bird on a window sill.</i>

49
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:29,765
<i>Yellow
bird on a window sill.</i>

50
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:33,437
<i>Pretty little
beak and a pretty little tail.</i>

51
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,704
<i>Pretty little beak</i>

52
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:36,776
<i>and a pretty little tail.</i>

53
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:48,587
<i>Check your racks.</i>

54
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,457
<i>There you go, Morgan!</i>

55
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,623
Hey, man.

56
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,093
You from Virginia?

57
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,526
I'm from Richmond.

58
00:04:57,528 --> 00:04:58,527
Well, just outside Richmond.

59
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,498
My name's Murphy.

60
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,769
Yeah, I know.

61
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,402
Oh, yeah.

62
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:07,937
Somebody told me
you're from Virginia.

63
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,038
Really?

64
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,076
Then why'd you ask?

65
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,642
Privates.

66
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:13,713
Get your asses up here.

67
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,983
Now, you boys seriously
need to unfuck yourselves.

68
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,385
You hear me?

69
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,422
None of you people get it.

70
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,055
Now, Murphy, show me something.

71
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,760
<i>Firing mine, rapidly
quick.</i>

72
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,107
Your turn, Private.

73
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:43,842
Murphy.

74
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:47,577
How tall are you?

75
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,745
5'7".

76
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:50,147
5'7" what?

77
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,014
- Just 5'7".
- 5'7", Sergeant.

78
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:54,651
5'7", Sergeant, sir.

79
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:56,586
You fast?

80
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:57,957
Yes, Sergeant.

81
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,892
All right, little man.

82
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,093
When the time comes I need
somebody to run for me,

83
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:05,127
I'm gonna ask you.

84
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:06,596
Till then, I want you to get
in Bartle here's back pocket

85
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:07,930
and I want you to stay there.

86
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,031
Understand?

87
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,800
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:10,802 --> 00:06:12,536
Get your shit, get
a rack near Bartle.

89
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,070
- You got that, Bartle?
- What, sir?

90
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:17,440
You got a new
girlfriend to keep you company.

91
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:19,209
<i>Then I
crushed his pretty yellow head.</i>

92
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,980
- Is that your mom?
- Huh?

93
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,813
Oh, yeah.

94
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:25,815
You jumped right
in, didn't you?

95
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:27,784
Into what?

96
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:28,819
This.

97
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,553
Oh, yeah.

98
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:31,654
Well, it's just
something I'm getting

99
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:33,623
under my belt, you know?

100
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,125
My dad was in the Marines
before he went to college.

101
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:37,860
I don't know if he, like
wanted me to join up

102
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:40,130
- or anything, but...
- Mm-hm.

103
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:41,998
I guess I just wanted
to do something good

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,668
before I do whatever
else it is I'm gonna do.

105
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,772
I think I'm gonna go to UVA
after this and study history.

106
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:49,841
History of what?

107
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:54,043
I don't know.
I just like history.

108
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:55,447
What about you?

109
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,949
Uhh, I almost
went to school.

110
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,019
But then...

111
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,752
I didn't.

112
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:05,057
I just wound up
fucking around and...

113
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,759
And not really doing
much of anything.

114
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,760
So why'd you join up?

115
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:13,262
Thing to do. I don't
know if it felt like

116
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:15,731
a good thing, but...

117
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,733
It felt like a thing.

118
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,574
Is it too late to, I
don't know, take it back?

119
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:27,043
- Come home?
- Ma.

120
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:28,644
Ma, it's done.

121
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,514
It's done. Okay?

122
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,149
Okay.
Let's just have a nice talk.

123
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:37,086
- Which base is it, again? Can I come see you?
- I don't know.

124
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:39,154
I don't know if they let us
have visitors at the base,

125
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:41,690
so I gotta find out.

126
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:44,995
- Well, I'd love to come.
- Yeah.

127
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,632
Oh, and your friends
have been asking after you.

128
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,534
Especially that uh...

129
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,670
What's-her-name? You know,
the one I never liked?

130
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:54,603
Hey, man, look.

131
00:07:54,605 --> 00:07:55,704
It's just me.

132
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:56,906
Come check this out.

133
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:57,973
I gotta go, Ma.

134
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:59,743
I'll write, okay?

135
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,644
Okay, we'll...

136
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,600
Hey, Sarge, you
got an extra razor?

137
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,769
You don't got your own?

138
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,939
I never needed one before.

139
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:30,543
So how come you need one now?

140
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:35,878
I think I wanna shave my head.

141
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,980
Go get some clippers before
you waste one of my razors.

142
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:39,184
That's
what I told him.

143
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,852
You seriously
never shaved before?

144
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:44,186
No, sir.

145
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:45,988
How old are you?

146
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,123
18.

147
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,892
Just turned last week.

148
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:50,060
And you?

149
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,094
20.

150
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,131
Fuck.

151
00:08:57,702 --> 00:09:00,539
Look, you guys are
my guys, right?

152
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,107
I ain't supposed to be
telling anyone this,

153
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:06,743
but our AO just came down
this morning from on high.

154
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:08,844
We're gonna be shipping out.

155
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:11,680
All right, you guys are gonna
be seeing some shit real soon.

156
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:13,382
It's gonna be a goat-fuck.

157
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:14,653
A what?

158
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,287
A goat-fuck.

159
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:21,023
So starting now, you guys have
to promise to do what I say.

160
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:22,858
Yeah,
sure thing, Sarge.

161
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,026
No, fuck that.

162
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:25,195
Don't give me that shit.

163
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,097
No sure thing this time.

164
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,031
Promise you'll do what I
say every fucking time.

165
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,166
- Yes, sir, we'll do what you say.
- I promise.

166
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:32,669
All right now. Look, there's
some folks who go to this war

167
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,936
and never pull a trigger.

168
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:36,006
That ain't gonna be you guys.

169
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,873
They're gonna kill the
fuck out of some of us.

170
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,709
We're gonna kill the
fuck out of some of them.

171
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:41,246
That's just the
way it's gonna go.

172
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,315
Now listen, you stick with
me, you do what I say,

173
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,651
I'll take care of you.

174
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,687
All right?

175
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,254
Yes, sir.

176
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:53,358
I always
take care of my guys.

177
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:05,705
Hey, Bartle?

178
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:12,175
Why do you think Sarge
treats us like he does?

179
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:13,843
Like what?

180
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,978
You know, like...

181
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,082
Like special.

182
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,818
It's not special, it's just...

183
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
He knows he can count on us.

184
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:26,257
How's he know a
thing like that?

185
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:31,261
Look, man, we're
gonna be fine.

186
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,729
Okay?

187
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:36,334
We just gotta watch each
other's backs, that's all.

188
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,002
Yeah, I got your back.

189
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:41,970
Okay, good.

190
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:43,906
Now go to fucking sleep
or I'm gonna kick the shit

191
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:44,943
out of you.

192
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:56,920
Shit,
Bartle, you okay?

193
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,320
Yeah, I'm good.

194
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:00,025
- Were you asleep?
- No.

195
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:03,862
Roger that. I'm coming up.

196
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,766
Third Platoon, on your feet!

197
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,205
Off and on, people,
we're going up.

198
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,977
Come on, let's move!

199
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:22,011
Move!

200
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:38,962
<i>We need eyes on that
second floor window, now!</i>

201
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,230
Move!

202
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:45,437
<i>Second floor! Second floor!</i>

203
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,517
- Come on, boy,
- I have incoming! Get down!

204
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,461
<i>Everybody clear?</i>

205
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:15,531
<i>Get him out of here!</i>

206
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,404
- You up?
- <i>We need more 2-40's!</i>

207
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,439
Let's kill these Hajji fucks!

208
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:27,009
Come on, fuck you!

209
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,023
Fuck you!

210
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:42,992
Ah!

211
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:43,993
Fuck you!

212
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,300
Come on.

213
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,434
Come on, come on.

214
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,569
No, no, no, no, no.

215
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,103
Sid, come on!

216
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:55,103
Come on.

217
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:56,906
Come on.

218
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:04,214
You didn't think you'd make
it that far, did you, buddy?

219
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,224
Oh, we
got a vehicle, Sarge!

220
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:16,261
One o'clock.

221
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,927
Come on, you fucks!

222
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,400
Wait.

223
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:25,401
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

224
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:28,371
It's a woman.

225
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:30,940
Wait, it's a fucking woman!

226
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,044
Hold off!

227
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:43,889
<i>Clear!</i>

228
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:55,498
Shit.

229
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,066
That bitch just got murdered.

230
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:27,930
Hey, Bartle!

231
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:28,967
Bartle.

232
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:32,904
Hey, come over here.

233
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,073
Hey, man, come over here.

234
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:39,074
Meet my parents.
My mom and dad.

235
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:41,109
- Brandon Bartle.
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

236
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:43,212
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

237
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:45,147
Proud of you, boys.
Very proud of you.

238
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:47,116
Did Murph tell you
I was in your shoes?

239
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:49,017
Yes, sir.

240
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,619
Well, it's very brave
what you guys are doing.

241
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:52,588
- Yes, sir.
- Where are you sitting?

242
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,690
- Oh, no, I'm just grabbing...
- Is your family here?

243
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:57,326
Uh, no, my mom had
to work tonight, so...

244
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:58,962
Well, then, sit with us.

245
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,463
Sit down this instant.

246
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:02,999
- Yeah, take a seat, man.
- Come on.

247
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:07,170
I just think this is so
nice that they do this

248
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,339
for the families,
don't you think?

249
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:12,208
- Yeah.
- Yes, ma'am.

250
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,276
So, you and Daniel,
will you be bunking

251
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:16,278
over there together, too?

252
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,449
Uh, I don't know what the
situation will be actually

253
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,017
when we get over there, but
it'd be great to stick together.

254
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,518
Yeah.

255
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,454
Mm, well, you
should, because my boy

256
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:29,157
will be getting more care
packages than anyone here.

257
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,127
I can promise you that.

258
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,095
So, if you need anything,
I just want you to know

259
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:35,297
you can write to me and
I'll send it right over.

260
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:37,199
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

261
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:38,570
- Okay?
- Okay.

262
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,575
Oh, hi.

263
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:47,776
It was so nice to
finally meet you.

264
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:49,579
Nice to meet you, too.

265
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:50,780
So he's doing a good job?

266
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:53,049
Yes, ma'am, very good.

267
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:55,184
That's so good.
Thanks for looking out for him.

268
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:56,752
You bet.
We look out for each other.

269
00:15:56,754 --> 00:15:57,990
Yeah.

270
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:01,590
Brandon...

271
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:03,261
Promise me you'll take
care of him over there?

272
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:06,628
Yeah, of course.

273
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,636
And listen, God forbid
something were to happen and...

274
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:16,439
But if it does, I really
would like to hear that

275
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:17,743
from you first.

276
00:16:19,744 --> 00:16:21,676
Sure.

277
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:23,115
You bet, ma'am.

278
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:25,815
Okay.

279
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:27,086
Thank you.

280
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:31,186
Okay, be safe, okay?

281
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:32,220
I will.

282
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:33,289
You too.

283
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,326
Yeah.

284
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,625
How many times we been
through that orchard, sir?

285
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:44,326
Writing a history
book, Corporal?

286
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:46,796
- No, sir.
- <i>Then quit counting.</i>

287
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,634
What is this?

288
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:51,702
A letter?

289
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:55,371
- Hey, give it back.
- Oh, it's from Mama.

290
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:56,873
- Come on, Bartle, give it back.
- "Dear Daniel..."

291
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,574
It's so weird she
calls you Daniel.

292
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:00,375
"We just got home.

293
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:03,513
"Your dad took me out
for Valentine's Day.

294
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,680
"It was nice, but don't worry,

295
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:09,852
"he knows you're
my real Valentine."

296
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:10,886
Is that supposed to
be for me, though?

297
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,555
Because I think

298
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:13,555
- I'm her real Valentine.
- Asshole.

299
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:14,724
You wish.

300
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:23,602
Some people ain't
cut out for this shit.

301
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:27,370
What,
do you mean Murph?

302
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,572
No, sir, Murph's
got his shit together.

303
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:30,672
Murph's solid.

304
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,480
Lieutenant Bellington.

305
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:39,715
Carry
on, Lieutenant.

306
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:40,949
How's the war, gentlemen?

307
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:42,218
Sir...

308
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,286
You tell me.

309
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:45,857
Your mic's on, so
whenever you're ready, sir.

310
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,294
Gentlemen, this
is the final push.

311
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,795
We're gonna drop
fire in this rat hole

312
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:55,765
for the next two
hours until dawn.

313
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,400
We'll still be shredding
those palm trees

314
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,238
when you get to them.

315
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:02,438
We'll take this city.

316
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,209
Once we do, the insurgency
will die on the vine.

317
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:10,345
I know not all of you read the
Bible, but those that do...

318
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:15,218
You know, this is the land
where Jonah was buried,

319
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,321
where he begged God's
justice to come.

320
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,921
And we are...

321
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:22,557
We are that justice.

322
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,830
Right now, as of this moment...

323
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:31,901
This is the most important
day of your lives.

324
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,840
You really think this is
the most important thing

325
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,307
you'll ever do?

326
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,546
I don't know.

327
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:44,779
<i>You really think
this is the most important</i>

328
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:45,817
<i>day of your life?</i>

329
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:51,621
I fucking hope not.

330
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,926
<i>You have anybody
waiting for you back home?</i>

331
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:22,684
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

332
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:23,919
What? What?

333
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:25,755
I have a leg cramp.

334
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:26,792
Okay.

335
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:30,058
You okay?

336
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,295
I'm good.

337
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:37,799
Tess, Tess, Tess,
Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess...

338
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:39,869
Stop that.

339
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,804
Tess, Tess, Tess,
Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess...

340
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:42,938
Shut up!

341
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,073
What?

342
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:45,507
I hate that.

343
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:46,976
You hate your name?

344
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:49,378
I hate
when you do that.

345
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,578
You know,
if I say it enough,

346
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,780
it stops meaning anything.

347
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:54,583
All I've got left is you.

348
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:56,584
Same thing with your name.

349
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:59,322
No, I got syllables.

350
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:03,625
Mm, Bartle, Bartle, Bartle,
Bartle, Bartle, Bartle,

351
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:05,763
Bartle, Bartle, Bartle...

352
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,444
<i>"He changes rivers
into wilderness</i>

353
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:25,113
<i>"and springs of water
into thirsty ground,</i>

354
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,615
<i>"fruitful land into salt waste,</i>

355
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:30,719
<i>"because of the wickedness
of those who dwell in it."</i>

356
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:32,587
Look at the ground.

357
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:36,491
Salt the ground, the
earth will bear no fruit.

358
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:39,394
There'll be nothing to eat.

359
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,529
These people will be no more.

360
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:45,034
Their spirits will not
come back to haunt us.

361
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:47,072
What you doing, Sarge?

362
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:54,445
It's from Judges.

363
00:21:55,613 --> 00:21:57,680
I will not see their eyes.

364
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,481
I will not see their bodies.

365
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,653
I will not feel their flesh.

366
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,524
What the fuck is Judges, man?

367
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:11,797
Dude, I think Sarge
is losing his shit.

368
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:44,920
One o'clock, one o'clock,
one o'fucking clock!

369
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:46,622
Get down, move!

370
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:49,658
I fell asleep.

371
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,059
I fucking fell asleep!

372
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:55,032
<i>Watch your right!</i>

373
00:23:57,868 --> 00:23:58,936
Let's go.

374
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:14,084
The windows.
Eyes on the windows.

375
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:28,130
Two shooters.

376
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:29,532
Top windows.

377
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:36,872
I got him!

378
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:37,873
Shit.

379
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:38,873
Goddamn.

380
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,241
One shooter.

381
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:51,186
You got him?

382
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:52,187
Hold on.

383
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:54,757
You see him?

384
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,324
Wait, shut up.

385
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:57,692
Wait.

386
00:24:57,694 --> 00:24:58,693
Wait.

387
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:00,865
Fuck!

388
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,565
Shit!

389
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:04,603
Sarge!

390
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:07,769
Where are you hit?

391
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:09,270
Medic!

392
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:11,006
- Where are you hit?
- I don't know.

393
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:12,574
- We need a medic!
- Cover!

394
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:13,575
Sarge!

395
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:14,613
Shit!

396
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,680
Hey, move, that's it.

397
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:21,016
Let's get this off.
Come on.

398
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:22,051
You're
doing good, man.

399
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,588
You're good.

400
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,789
Come on, take it easy.

401
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:28,990
All right.

402
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:30,225
All right, now look at me.

403
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:31,360
Oh, fuck.

404
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:32,594
Yes.

405
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:33,632
Fuck!

406
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,006
Come on, buddy.

407
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:45,644
Vasquez, come on.

408
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:47,843
Oh, shit.

409
00:25:59,222 --> 00:26:00,823
Oh, shit.

410
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:04,293
Medic!

411
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:05,393
Ah, fuck.

412
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:06,764
But he's dead.

413
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,701
Well, you can't
leave him here.

414
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:21,876
What you looking at, Private?

415
00:26:21,878 --> 00:26:24,779
I thought he was
gonna say something.

416
00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:26,914
Well, they usually don't.

417
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:32,890
This one guy said something
once just before he went.

418
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:38,192
What'd he say?

419
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:41,930
He just grabbed my
hand and he goes...

420
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:45,703
"Hey, man, check if
I shit my pants."

421
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:49,708
That's it?

422
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,341
Yeah, that's it.

423
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:04,186
Yeah.

424
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:05,223
Come on.

425
00:27:07,357 --> 00:27:09,424
First squad, move out!

426
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,981
Man, I feel fucking
crazy right now.

427
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:35,883
You know, I was just
happy it wasn't me,

428
00:27:35,885 --> 00:27:37,952
that's the first
thing I thought.

429
00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:39,888
That's fucking crazy, isn't it?

430
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,423
No, man, what's crazy
is not thinking that shit.

431
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:43,662
You know?

432
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,207
Third
platoon, on your feet!

433
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,310
We're moving!

434
00:29:36,472 --> 00:29:37,873
Thank you.

435
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,810
Oh, no, no, it's on me.

436
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:43,213
You just got back?

437
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:50,488
How was it out there?

438
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:42,671
Brandon!

439
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:44,640
Where were you?

440
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,341
I was waiting.

441
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:49,443
Let me look at you.

442
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:50,444
Are you in one piece?

443
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:51,947
Yeah.

444
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,951
No, I'm fine, I'm just tired.

445
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:00,521
Okay.

446
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:03,357
Okay, Ma.

447
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:05,964
Ah!

448
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:29,084
Ms. Bartle?

449
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:30,619
Is Brandon home?

450
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:33,287
- He's out.
- Oh, that's too bad.

451
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:36,324
Any idea where?
I know the area pretty well.

452
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:39,161
Listen, whatever you're selling,
mister, we don't want any.

453
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,129
- No, pardon, uh...
- You had him all ready.

454
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:43,265
You don't get to take him
again, you understand?

455
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:46,267
Oh, I'm not a recruiter or
anything like that, Ms. Bartle.

456
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:48,103
I'm one of the good guys.

457
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:49,671
Says who?

458
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:51,305
I'm just following
up on a few things

459
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:53,443
from Brandon's last post.

460
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:56,311
I have a few questions for him.

461
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:58,212
It's routine, more or less.

462
00:31:58,214 --> 00:32:00,449
Well, he's not here.

463
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:01,482
Yeah, you said that.

464
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:03,517
Mm-hm.

465
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,089
Would you mind if I
ask you a few things?

466
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:12,096
Has your son ever mentioned
the name Daniel Murphy?

467
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,198
Garrett Sterling, perhaps?

468
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,766
We haven't talked much.

469
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:19,267
Hm.

470
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:21,236
Right.

471
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:23,471
Well...

472
00:32:23,473 --> 00:32:25,175
When you do see Brandon, will
you give him this for me?

473
00:32:30,646 --> 00:32:32,082
Thank you, ma'am.

474
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:37,451
And what'd you
people do to him?

475
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,621
He won't get out of bed.
He don't care about nothing.

476
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:42,324
It's like he doesn't know
where he is half the time.

477
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:44,659
- I understand.
- Do you?!

478
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:46,661
You got kids?!

479
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:47,966
About half a million.

480
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,501
That's not even
counting reserves.

481
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:53,503
Yeah?

482
00:32:55,138 --> 00:32:57,507
Well, I've just got the one.

483
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,754
Thanks, Ma.

484
00:33:13,323 --> 00:33:15,426
CID, what is that?

485
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:19,463
Criminal
Investigation Division.

486
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,832
Jesus.

487
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:26,104
What happened over there?

488
00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:38,680
Yeah, I'm trying

489
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:41,115
to reach Staff
Sergeant Sterling.

490
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:46,755
Right, yeah.

491
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,763
No, no, no, I'm
just a friend of him,

492
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:56,363
just served with him,
I was just wondering

493
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:57,665
what he's up to, is all.

494
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,069
No, I can...

495
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:01,268
Yeah, thank you.

496
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,440
No, I...

497
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,109
I might call back sometime.

498
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,146
Yeah, thanks.

499
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,297
The moon looks different here.

500
00:34:36,706 --> 00:34:38,175
Not like home.

501
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:41,478
Fuck home.

502
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:44,545
Keep thinking about
home, you end up there

503
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:45,649
with a flag shoved up your ass.

504
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,849
Jesus Christ, get your mind out

505
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:50,452
of your girlfriend's
pussy, Bartle.

506
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:52,354
Don't have a
girlfriend, Sarge.

507
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,822
Yeah, sure you do,

508
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,258
or you wouldn't
say it like that.

509
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,626
I don't, or at least
I don't think I do.

510
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:02,229
She's going to school, so I
figured the best thing was...

511
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:04,166
Well, you know.

512
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,666
She
dropped you then?

513
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:07,869
What?

514
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:09,371
No.

515
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,704
I'd kill the bitch.

516
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:16,311
What the heck you
cackling about, Murphy?

517
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:18,215
Everything's just
so goddamn funny, sir.

518
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,525
Bran?

519
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:31,461
Bran?

520
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,764
Bran.

521
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,168
Phone for you.

522
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:39,333
Who?

523
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:40,737
It's Tess.

524
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,572
I'm not here.

525
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,805
She and Luke and
the gang are going

526
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:45,907
to the river on the weekend.

527
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:47,876
They want you to go.

528
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:49,344
Okay.

529
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:50,878
What should I tell her then?

530
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,481
That
I'll call her back.

531
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:56,584
So should I tell
her you're not coming?

532
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:59,653
Just tell her
whatever you want.

533
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:02,557
Hey.
Your friends wanna see you.

534
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:05,492
I'm not the one
who told them I was back, Ma.

535
00:36:05,494 --> 00:36:06,728
It's not like it's
a secret, honey.

536
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,630
Everyone knows you're home.

537
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:10,432
It'll be good for you.

538
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,601
Ma, please, just get
the fuck out of my room.

539
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,637
Okay?

540
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:25,947
- What the fuck?!
- Get up!

541
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:27,382
- What the fuck are you doing?!
- You don't get to stay

542
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:28,749
in bed for another month!

543
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:30,485
- Fuck!
- I can't take this.

544
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:32,354
Who the fuck are you?!

545
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,554
Talk to me!

546
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:35,757
Listen to me.

547
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:39,494
Let me fucking sleep, okay?!

548
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:40,530
Okay?!

549
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:08,322
What's up, hero?

550
00:37:08,324 --> 00:37:09,724
Same old, same old?

551
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:10,958
Yup.

<i>This is Anderson.</i>

<i>Then
what are you doing?</i>

574
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:21,496

00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,430
<i>So why
don't you come in?</i>

576
00:38:23,432 --> 00:38:25,999
<i>You tell us your side
of things, Sergeant.</i>

577
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,802
Ah, shit, sir. I
think we both know I ain't

nobody's sergeant no more.

We're still at work, people.

580
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:13,471
Keep the channel clear.

581
00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:18,675
Come on, LT,
it's driving music.

582
00:41:21,177 --> 00:41:23,311
That's cold, sir.

583
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:24,778
<i>Hey, I'm
taking requests.</i>

584
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,847
<i>What you wanna hear, sir?</i>

585
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:29,717
You're requesting
to get your ass sent home.

586

<i>You're
gonna send us home</i>

587
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:32,686
for playing music, sir?

588
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:33,755
Personally, I wouldn't waste...

589
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:36,824
Fuck!

590
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:37,825
Stop, stop, here.

591
00:41:41,697 --> 00:41:42,996
Come on, let's move!

592
00:41:45,034 --> 00:41:46,233
My 12, on the roof!

593
00:42:01,784 --> 00:42:02,819
Oh, shit!

594
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,787
No!

<i>Man is down!</i>

00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:47,161
You're doing great,
just stay still.

00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:48,197
You okay?

598
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:50,800
Lay back for me.

599
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,170
Lay back for me.

600
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:57,574
Just lay back.

601
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,081
Ooh, it's almost over.

602
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,117
Good.

603
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,089
Okay.

604
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,693
Okay, you're almost done.

605
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,234
Hey.

606
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:26,336
Hey, calm down.

607
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,204
Breathe, just breathe.

608
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:34,909
You're okay,
soldier, you're okay.

609
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:42,983
We got Woodward.

610
00:43:42,985 --> 00:43:44,754
Yes, sir.

611
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:47,688
We got Scotts.

612
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,725
Scotts?!

613
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:52,059
Murphy!

614
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:54,028
Murphy!

615
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,197
Private Murphy!

616
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:58,066
- Murphy, no Murphy?
- Just to come on back.

617
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:13,947
And as John did for Jesus...

618
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:15,916
Let us wash it
away, wash it away.

619
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:19,454
For unless you are born of
the water and the Spirit,

620
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:23,023
you cannot enter
the kingdom of God.

621
00:44:23,025 --> 00:44:25,159
Private Whitaker, do you
take the Lord Jesus Christ

622
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:26,360
as your savior?

623
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:28,195
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

624
00:44:28,197 --> 00:44:29,963
Then I baptize you in
the name of the Father

625
00:44:29,965 --> 00:44:31,432
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

626
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:32,867
Amen, amen.

627
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:34,836
Amen!

628
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:56,324
Hey, Bartle.

629
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,358
Hey, man.

630
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,959
Where you been?

631
00:44:58,961 --> 00:45:00,197
I've been here.

632
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,197
Your mom wrote.

633
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:04,233
Thanks.

634
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,173
You okay, man?

635
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:16,346
Yeah.

636
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:21,414
You looking at that girl?

637
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:24,922
For how long?

638
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:28,356
I've been coming
up here every day.

639
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,023
Mm!

640
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:31,291
Every day?

641
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:33,427
She know you're stalking her?

642
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:34,528
Probably.

643
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:38,800
You talk to her yet?

644
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:39,934
No.

645
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:40,971
I just watch.

646
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:45,405
See how she talks to them
on the way in like that?

647
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:48,008
She always does that.

648
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,543
Yeah? Just get yourself
like a fucking

649
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:51,311
whooping cough or something

650
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:53,280
and get her to take
another look at you.

651
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,282
Hey, what's it called
when the doctor

652
00:45:55,284 --> 00:45:58,952
makes you take your pants
down and asks you to cough?

653
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:00,588
You know what I mean?

654
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,925
Fuck, dude, they could
send you home maybe.

655
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,001
They should just bomb
this place off the face

656
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:15,336
of the earth.

657
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:18,139
I hate it so much.

658
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:20,844
Yeah. Some fucking garden
of Eden, right?

659
00:46:22,878 --> 00:46:26,884
I'm never gonna tell anybody
I was here when I get back.

660
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,117
When I get back, I just...

661
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,588
I'm gonna get a place to myself.

662
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:38,092
I'm not gonna go no place
and not talk to anybody.

663
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:42,499
Wake up every morning
and go run, eat right...

664
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,336
And let my fucking
hair grow back out.

665
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:54,575
I might show up, and
if somebody says,

666
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:56,177
"Hey, Murph, didn't
you used to be

667
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:58,012
"in the Army or something?"

668
00:46:58,014 --> 00:47:02,316
And I'll just say, "That
was something I did

669
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:04,651
"for a little while."

670
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:05,887
Or maybe I won't even say that.

671
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:06,923
Maybe...

672
00:47:13,028 --> 00:47:15,965
I don't want this
to be a part of me.

673
00:47:32,481 --> 00:47:34,048
All right, dude, let's
fucking get outta here.

674
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,048
Come on.

675
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,284
Come on.

676
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,450
I'm gonna stay here, man.

677
00:47:37,452 --> 00:47:38,653
No, come on, there...

678
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,387
Dude, let's go, seriously.

679
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:42,188
Come on.

680
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,472
Murph!

681
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:45,422
Murph!

682
00:49:43,378 --> 00:49:44,612
Oh.

683
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:45,648
Is...

684
00:49:47,115 --> 00:49:49,617
Are you Brandon's mom?

685
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:50,653
Amy, right?

686
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:54,121
And who are you?

687
00:49:54,123 --> 00:49:55,322
Maureen.

688
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:57,226
My name's Maureen Murphy.

689
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:01,097
My son served with your son.

690
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,130
Did he?

691
00:50:03,132 --> 00:50:05,099
Mm-hm.

692
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:08,769
Let me ask you, did your
boy come back an asshole, too?

693
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:11,008
He didn't come back.

694
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:15,675
- Oh, oh, my God.
- He's missing.

695
00:50:15,677 --> 00:50:17,380
They don't know yet.

696
00:50:18,547 --> 00:50:19,813
I am so sorry.

697
00:50:19,815 --> 00:50:21,148
Here.

698
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,416
Why don't you come in?

699
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:24,452
Thank you.

700
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,353
Is there
something I can get you?

701
00:50:26,355 --> 00:50:28,222
No, I'm fine.

702
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:29,490
I just wanna talk to Brandon.

703
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:30,627
It'd be nice to see him again.

704
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,360
You met him before?

705
00:50:34,362 --> 00:50:35,628
Once, yeah, I did.

706
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:38,134
There was a party at the base.

707
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:45,206
Well, I don't know when
Bran's gonna be home.

708
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,441
Well, would you mind
if I just wait a while?

709
00:50:48,443 --> 00:50:50,411
I just have some...

710
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:52,782
I wanna ask him some things.

711
00:50:54,182 --> 00:50:56,052
I just wanna know what happened.

712
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:01,688
These people, they're
not telling me anything,

713
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,559
and I'm just sorting
it all out myself.

714
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:10,563
You know, I don't know how
somebody just goes missing.

715
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:12,398
I just don't.

716
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,135
And I just wanna know if was...

717
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:17,804
- Oh, my, I'm so sorry!
- I'll get that, it's okay.

718
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:18,805
Please, will you...

719
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:20,240
Oh, gosh!

720
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:22,278
Oh, oh, okay, hold on.

721
00:51:26,248 --> 00:51:27,680
Oh, God.

722
00:51:27,682 --> 00:51:29,782
Here.

723
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:32,489
I'm just a mess, I'm just...

724
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:39,695
I really just wish
I didn't let him go.

725
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:44,264
I know. Come here.

726
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:45,301
I know.

727
00:52:04,253 --> 00:52:05,351
Ooh!

728
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:07,223
Send it down.

729
00:53:36,445 --> 00:53:37,647
Shit!

730
00:54:02,471 --> 00:54:04,737
Jesus! Set him down.

731
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:05,938
- No, I don't know.
- Bartle!

732
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,807
Hey, Bartle!

733
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:09,909
No, we just pulled
him out of the water.

734
00:54:09,911 --> 00:54:11,077
- Come on, buddy!
- Off the road. By the underpass.

735
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:12,545
Wake up, buddy!

736
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:14,347
I think he's waking up now.

737
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:16,516
He's up.

738
00:54:16,518 --> 00:54:17,918
You all right?

739
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,820
Yeah, no, I'm good.

740
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:22,692
- Come on.
- I'm good.

741
00:54:26,594 --> 00:54:28,494
We heard a noise.

742
00:54:28,496 --> 00:54:30,532
So we ran over.

743
00:54:31,634 --> 00:54:32,633
It was Brandon Bartle.

744
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:39,576
Bartle.

745
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:43,379
Bartle.

746
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:14,311
Try to
keep it together, buddy.

747
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:21,048
<i>People just
like to say stuff.</i>

748
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,150
My friend told me
something the other day.

749
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:26,619
She said, "Maureen, you gotta
find your truth in all this."

750
00:55:26,621 --> 00:55:28,755
Your truth.

751
00:55:28,757 --> 00:55:29,822
What the hell does that mean?

752
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:31,624
<i>"Your truth"?</i>

753
00:55:31,626 --> 00:55:33,459
<i>Like mine's
different than yours,</i>

754
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:35,795
<i>or you got one and
I've got another?</i>

755
00:55:35,797 --> 00:55:41,467
<i>I was watching this show
the other day, about birds.</i>

756
00:55:41,469 --> 00:55:45,072
<i>They always said that if
you touch a baby bird,</i>

757
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:47,007
<i>the mother'll, you
know, smell you on it</i>

758
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:49,175
<i>and then she wouldn't
take her baby back.</i>

759
00:55:49,177 --> 00:55:50,778
<i>Turns out it isn't true.</i>

760
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,613
<i>Birds can't even smell, really.</i>

761
00:55:53,615 --> 00:55:55,985
<i>Besides, that's her babies.</i>

762
00:55:58,853 --> 00:56:01,921
<i>Where they get these
stupid ideas, I don't know.</i>

763
00:56:03,826 --> 00:56:04,894
Bran?

764
00:56:27,782 --> 00:56:29,883
<i>Let us wash it
away, wash it away,</i>

765
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:32,552
<i>for unless you are born of
the water and the Spirit,</i>

766
00:56:32,554 --> 00:56:34,921
<i>you cannot enter
the kingdom of God.</i>

767
00:57:00,248 --> 00:57:01,517
The usual?

768
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,619
Yeah, yeah.

769
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:10,958
- Hey.
- Hey.

770
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,958
How you doing?

771
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,959
Good. You?

772
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:14,927
Yeah.

773
00:57:14,929 --> 00:57:17,764
Good, you've got like a
back room back there, right?

774
00:57:17,766 --> 00:57:19,766
Yeah, why?

775
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:21,034
I could really use the
place to crash for the night.

776
00:57:21,036 --> 00:57:22,070
Yeah.

777
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:27,444
Really?

778
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:29,675
Yeah, I mean, it's just
fucking for one night, you know?

779
00:57:29,677 --> 00:57:31,612
No, man, I can't...

780
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,679
You fuck, I've...

781
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:34,014
Come on!

782
00:57:34,016 --> 00:57:35,552
- Private.
- Fuck!

783
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:39,586
Hands where I can see them.

784
00:57:39,588 --> 00:57:42,588
I'm Captain Anderson, CID.

785
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:44,624
I've been looking for you.

786
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:45,661
Easy now.

787
00:57:47,896 --> 00:57:49,164
Are you armed?

788
00:57:50,164 --> 00:57:51,264
No.

789
00:57:51,266 --> 00:57:53,766
Sober?

790
00:57:53,768 --> 00:57:55,571
Wishing I wasn't, sir.

791
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,775
Is that what the Army doctors
prescribed before you left?

792
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:03,577
Disappear from sight?

793
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:05,045
Drink yourself
into a black hole?

794
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:06,914
Yeah.

795
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,017
As I recall, that's pretty
much what they said.

796
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:13,689
You ready to take a
ride to the base with me?

797
00:58:18,726 --> 00:58:20,195
It's time, son.

798
00:58:30,905 --> 00:58:33,041
Who do you think you're
helping by keeping quiet?

799
00:58:36,177 --> 00:58:37,614
Sterling?

800
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:42,014
Why don't you ask Sterling?

801
00:58:42,016 --> 00:58:44,952
Sergeant
Sterling's gone.

802
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,686
Gone?

803
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:48,625
He took himself
out of the game.

804
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:53,659
It's just you now.

805
00:59:12,114 --> 00:59:13,213
Fuck!

806
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,163
Okay, so, where are you?

807
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:30,363
<i>A stockade.</i>

808
00:59:30,365 --> 00:59:31,634
<i>Army jail.</i>

809
00:59:33,068 --> 00:59:34,137
Well...

810
00:59:35,737 --> 00:59:38,104
Are they gonna
let you come home?

811
00:59:38,106 --> 00:59:39,338
I think
this is gonna be home

812
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:41,041
for me for a while, Ma.

813
00:59:41,043 --> 00:59:44,614
Oh, God, Bran.

814
00:59:45,914 --> 00:59:48,280
Ma, I need you to know...

815
00:59:48,282 --> 00:59:50,316
<i>You don't have to
say you're sorry, okay?</i>

816
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:51,788
I know you are.

817
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:54,920
Or that it's gonna be okay.

818
00:59:54,922 --> 00:59:56,389
Or you wish things
were different.

819
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:58,291
You don't have to
say any of that.

820
00:59:58,293 --> 01:00:01,862
And I know you love me
the same way I love you,

821
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:05,264
<i>so you don't have to
say any of that, either.</i>

822
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:06,800
I know, Ma.

823
01:00:06,802 --> 01:00:08,200
I know.

824
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:09,237
Well...

825
01:00:11,739 --> 01:00:14,441
Are you gonna let me
visit you this time?

826
01:00:16,811 --> 01:00:17,846
Sure, Ma.

827
01:00:23,952 --> 01:00:26,186
All right. I gotta...

828
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:27,454
I gotta go, Ma.

829
01:00:27,456 --> 01:00:28,691
<i>Bye.</i>

830
01:00:31,994 --> 01:00:33,994
Thanks for that.

831
01:00:33,996 --> 01:00:37,197
They have an old saying
about situations like this.

832
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:39,766
I don't know. What's that?

833
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:43,202
You're only as
sick as your secrets.

834
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:48,974
They've got an old saying
about everything, don't they?

835
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:51,013
Just about.

836
01:01:14,068 --> 01:01:15,103
Help me.

837
01:01:22,244 --> 01:01:24,047
What just happened?

838
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:29,849
Murph!

839
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:31,517
Murph, listen to me!

840
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,755
On here!

841
01:01:56,077 --> 01:01:57,112
Hurry.

842
01:02:07,789 --> 01:02:10,893
Hey, we
need help over here!

843
01:02:57,105 --> 01:02:58,905
Bartle.

844
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:00,409
Your visitor's here.

845
01:03:15,123 --> 01:03:16,958
Hi, Brandon.

846
01:03:18,226 --> 01:03:20,195
Mrs. Murphy.

847
01:03:27,501 --> 01:03:29,137
You look so thin.

848
01:03:36,577 --> 01:03:40,546
They said that you only
wanted to talk to me.

849
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:41,918
Is that right?

850
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:46,121
Yeah.

851
01:03:48,023 --> 01:03:49,258
Why?

852
01:03:54,429 --> 01:03:58,367
You said you wanted to
hear it from me first.

853
01:04:05,206 --> 01:04:06,241
Here I am.

854
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,948
The day Murph, uh...

855
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:29,028
We were on a morning patrol
a few days after the...

856
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:32,168
Camp got attacked
by mortar fire.

857
01:04:34,001 --> 01:04:35,971
Murph was in bad shape.

858
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:41,441
We all were, but they
sent us back out anyway.

859
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:43,409
<i>I guess they didn't want
it to look like we got hurt</i>

860
01:04:43,411 --> 01:04:44,980
<i>as bad as we did.</i>

861
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,286
<i>Murph was with us, but...</i>

862
01:04:51,552 --> 01:04:54,022
<i>He wouldn't talk to anybody.</i>

863
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:12,304
Halt.

864
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:13,642
Hold up!

865
01:05:25,586 --> 01:05:27,355
All right, pull back.

866
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:32,694
LT.

867
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,166
That what I think it is?

868
01:05:41,168 --> 01:05:42,237
Yeah, maybe.

869
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:46,438
Fuck.

870
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,309
Goddamn Hajji motherfuckers!

871
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,476
So we need to move?

872
01:05:50,478 --> 01:05:52,347
Motherfucking animals.

873
01:05:56,217 --> 01:05:57,420
Murph.

874
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,758
Murph, what's up, you think?

875
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,228
Move back, move the vics
back! Move the vics back!

876
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,264
Move back!

877
01:06:11,099 --> 01:06:12,635
Savior Six, this
is Three Agile, over.

878
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:19,371
I need a EOD team
to my location.

879
01:06:19,373 --> 01:06:20,472
<i>All the way!</i>

880
01:06:20,474 --> 01:06:21,807
Sarge, what is it?

881
01:06:21,809 --> 01:06:23,078
Body bomb.

882
01:06:26,514 --> 01:06:29,182
All right, listen up!

883
01:06:29,184 --> 01:06:31,217
EOD's on the way.

884
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:33,153
I want a clean sweep.

885
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,186
No surprises.

886
01:06:46,134 --> 01:06:47,702
Clear. Two coming out.

887
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:58,505
All right, come on.

888
01:07:58,507 --> 01:07:59,708
Let's go, bud.

889
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:03,510
Hey.

890
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:04,547
Let's go.

891
01:08:09,217 --> 01:08:11,554
You can see her, too, right?

892
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,595
Yeah, I see her.

893
01:08:23,597 --> 01:08:24,763
Come on.

894
01:08:24,765 --> 01:08:26,801
We're all clear in here.

895
01:08:28,869 --> 01:08:30,305
Let's go. Grab your weapon.

896
01:08:36,578 --> 01:08:38,781
<i>Savior
Six, this is Three Agile, over.</i>

897
01:08:43,284 --> 01:08:45,184
<i>Savior Three, pull
back, pull back.</i>

898
01:08:45,186 --> 01:08:47,222
<i>Meet the vics at the
intersection, over.</i>

899
01:08:50,692 --> 01:08:52,795
<i>Stand by to copy, over.</i>

900
01:09:01,302 --> 01:09:02,835
<i>Hang
tight, we are almost there.</i>

901
01:09:02,837 --> 01:09:04,303
Copy that.

902
01:09:04,305 --> 01:09:05,370
Get safe, people.

903
01:09:05,372 --> 01:09:07,507
We making a hole!

904
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:09,808
<i>All Savior Three elements,
pull back to the hard ball.</i>

905
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:12,312
<i>I say again, pull back
to the hard ball, over.</i>

906
01:09:21,756 --> 01:09:24,627
<i>I'll do the countdown.</i>

907
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:29,495
Yo, whoa, whoa, where's Murph?

908
01:09:29,497 --> 01:09:30,562
Where's Murph?

909
01:09:30,564 --> 01:09:32,232
I don't know.

910
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,366
Francazino,
where's Murph?

911
01:09:34,368 --> 01:09:35,367
<i>In five,</i>

912
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:36,869
four, three...

913
01:09:36,871 --> 01:09:38,338
Murph!

914
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,472
<i>Two,</i>

915
01:09:39,474 --> 01:09:40,505
<i>one.</i>

916
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:48,848
Murphy!

917
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:49,885
Murphy!

918
01:09:51,586 --> 01:09:54,590
Private Murphy,
speak the fuck up!

919
01:09:57,559 --> 01:09:58,691
Hey.

920
01:09:58,693 --> 01:10:00,326
Hey, where's your boy?

921
01:10:00,328 --> 01:10:02,794
I don't know.
I don't know, sir.

922
01:10:02,796 --> 01:10:04,731
Well, when's the last
time you saw him?

923
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,465
When we were checking
that building back there.

924
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:07,567
Jesus.

925
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:09,369
What was he doing?

926
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,503
I don't know, he was
fucking hanging back,

927
01:10:10,505 --> 01:10:11,907
but we left together.

928
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:16,541
Ah, fuck.

929
01:10:16,543 --> 01:10:17,579
Yeah.

930
01:10:18,813 --> 01:10:20,479
We lost Murphy.

931
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:22,714
I'm gonna take a
team, go look for him.

932
01:10:22,716 --> 01:10:25,751
<i>Take off and sweep every
building east to west.</i>

933
01:10:30,057 --> 01:10:31,460
He was
sitting right here.

934
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:47,810
Hey.

935
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:50,309
Hey.

936
01:10:50,311 --> 01:10:51,510
What?

937
01:10:51,512 --> 01:10:52,911
He say anything to you?

938
01:10:52,913 --> 01:10:54,414
Anything funny?

939
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,815
No.

940
01:10:55,817 --> 01:10:57,252
- Look at me, anything?
- No.

941
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,521
Over here!

942
01:11:15,737 --> 01:11:16,872
That don't mean shit.

943
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:19,972
Christ, a drop of
blood in this city

944
01:11:19,974 --> 01:11:21,377
don't mean a
motherfucking thing.

945
01:11:24,912 --> 01:11:26,447
So what do we do now, Sarge?

946
01:11:28,682 --> 01:11:29,848
Let's get going.

947
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:31,552
Sun'll be down soon.

948
01:11:35,756 --> 01:11:38,493
<i>We searched for
I don't know how many hours.</i>

949
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,461
<i>Second Platoon
formed a perimeter</i>

950
01:11:42,463 --> 01:11:44,129
<i>in case some dude nabbed him</i>

951
01:11:44,131 --> 01:11:46,933
<i>and was trying to
get him out of town.</i>

952
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:48,968
<i>The rest of us worked
our way through the city,</i>

953
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,405
<i>block by block.</i>

954
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,138
<i>Our squad took point.</i>

955
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:03,383
Sarge.

956
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:04,420
Hold up!

957
01:12:09,123 --> 01:12:10,992
She was out earlier.

958
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:13,593
You sure?

959
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:14,630
Yeah.

960
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,475
What's up?

961
01:13:01,743 --> 01:13:03,843
Alpha, sweep left.

962
01:13:03,845 --> 01:13:06,044
Bravo, 360 perimeter, hold here.

963
01:13:06,046 --> 01:13:07,847
<i>The
woman told Sterling</i>

964
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:09,749
<i>that she'd seen an
American walking</i>

965
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:12,218
<i>toward the edge of the city.</i>

966
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,619
<i>Alone.</i>

967
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:15,588
<i>With no shoes on.</i>

968
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:17,156
Bartle, with me.

969
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:19,528
<i>He looked lost, she said.</i>

970
01:13:21,061 --> 01:13:22,762
<i>Sergeant knew it
had to be Murph,</i>

971
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:25,164
<i>but he didn't tell anybody.</i>

972
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:27,098
<i>Whatever we were gonna find,</i>

973
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,000
<i>Sterling didn't
want any witnesses.</i>

974
01:13:29,002 --> 01:13:31,970
<i>He wanted it just to be us.</i>

975
01:13:31,972 --> 01:13:33,841
<i>In our report, we, um...</i>

976
01:13:35,777 --> 01:13:37,143
<i>We wrote that we returned
to base that night</i>

977
01:13:37,145 --> 01:13:39,014
<i>without finding Murph.</i>

978
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,520
But that's not true.

979
01:13:47,488 --> 01:13:48,523
No, ma'am.

980
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:50,525
It wasn't.

981
01:14:09,644 --> 01:14:10,913
Hey.

982
01:14:39,573 --> 01:14:42,040
What's he saying?

983
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:43,709
He said he saw a boy.

984
01:14:43,711 --> 01:14:45,210
What boy? Murph?

985
01:14:45,212 --> 01:14:47,546
That's all he
said, he saw a boy.

986
01:14:47,548 --> 01:14:48,583
Where?

987
01:14:50,184 --> 01:14:51,954
He's gonna show us.

988
01:15:27,354 --> 01:15:29,021
Something ain't right, Sarge.

989
01:15:29,023 --> 01:15:31,293
This feels like
a fucking set-up.

990
01:15:34,228 --> 01:15:35,727
Ah, fuck it.

991
01:15:35,729 --> 01:15:37,632
One way to find out.

992
01:16:58,912 --> 01:17:00,615
Help me get him out.

993
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:12,827
Oh!

994
01:17:13,927 --> 01:17:15,730
Fuck!

995
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:22,671
Motherfuckers tried
to castrate him.

996
01:17:41,389 --> 01:17:42,757
I'm so sorry.

997
01:17:53,266 --> 01:17:55,134
<i>Best I can tell,
Murph slipped away</i>

998
01:17:55,136 --> 01:17:57,773
<i>as soon as we stepped outside.</i>

999
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:02,775
<i>Who knows what he was thinking?</i>

1000
01:18:02,777 --> 01:18:05,212
<i>If he was even thinking at all.</i>

1001
01:18:40,448 --> 01:18:41,483
Oh, God!

1002
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,752
Who the fuck did that?

1003
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,954
Goddamn it.

1004
01:18:50,891 --> 01:18:52,827
What do we do with him?

1005
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,034
We do what we came here to do.

1006
01:19:02,036 --> 01:19:04,005
Fuck, we take him back.

1007
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:07,074
No.

1008
01:19:08,275 --> 01:19:10,342
We can't take him back.

1009
01:19:10,344 --> 01:19:11,747
Not like this.

1010
01:19:13,113 --> 01:19:15,246
Like what don't matter.

1011
01:19:15,248 --> 01:19:16,885
We got a job to do.

1012
01:19:18,085 --> 01:19:20,020
Look at him.

1013
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:24,924
I did.

1014
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:26,558
Look at him.

1015
01:19:29,596 --> 01:19:30,831
Ah, fuck.

1016
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:45,076
All right, fine.

1017
01:19:45,078 --> 01:19:46,148
What, then?

1018
01:19:48,082 --> 01:19:50,115
I don't know.

1019
01:19:50,117 --> 01:19:51,418
Let me think.

1020
01:20:11,872 --> 01:20:12,907
Fuck.

1021
01:20:15,141 --> 01:20:19,245
You go get the Hajji with the
cart, bring him over here.

1022
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:21,082
Go fucking get the
Hajji with the cart.

1023
01:20:26,052 --> 01:20:29,021
Anyone hears about this...

1024
01:20:29,023 --> 01:20:31,656
We need to fix it like
it never happened.

1025
01:20:31,658 --> 01:20:33,228
Understand?

1026
01:20:43,404 --> 01:20:45,540
<i>"Fix it like
it never happened."</i>

1027
01:20:47,507 --> 01:20:50,177
<i>That's what Murph wanted
more than anything.</i>

1028
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:56,915
<i>Getting separated,
wandering off...</i>

1029
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:58,953
<i>None of that was an accident.</i>

1030
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:04,690
<i>Murph was looking for
a way to disappear.</i>

1031
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:06,962
<i>And he finally found one.</i>

1032
01:21:10,497 --> 01:21:12,533
<i>I didn't wanna take
that away from him.</i>

1033
01:21:14,601 --> 01:21:18,974
<i>I figured if Murph couldn't
forget, then maybe...</i>

1034
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,040
<i>Maybe he could be forgotten.</i>

1035
01:23:34,742 --> 01:23:37,342
Like it never happened.

1036
01:24:13,814 --> 01:24:17,318
You didn't think that
I would wanna see my son?

1037
01:24:23,157 --> 01:24:24,659
Not like he was.

1038
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:27,162
I...

1039
01:24:30,296 --> 01:24:33,233
I didn't want you to remember
him the way that I do.

1040
01:24:37,203 --> 01:24:39,407
That's not your
decision to make.

1041
01:25:06,332 --> 01:25:09,601
This is probably gonna
seem silly now, but...

1042
01:25:09,603 --> 01:25:10,835
Will you...

1043
01:25:10,837 --> 01:25:12,336
Yeah.

1044
01:25:12,338 --> 01:25:13,638
Just tell me where it happened

1045
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,741
just so I kind of have an idea?

1046
01:25:16,743 --> 01:25:19,447
No, that's not silly at all.

1047
01:25:24,284 --> 01:25:26,451
We found him here.

1048
01:25:26,453 --> 01:25:28,387
Right about...

1049
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:29,888
Here.

1050
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:32,660
And we carried him
to the water here.

1051
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:37,398
And then we just let him go.

1052
01:25:39,365 --> 01:25:42,334
Right about here it
opens up into the gulf,

1053
01:25:42,336 --> 01:25:45,539
and I guess that's
where he stopped.

1054
01:25:53,346 --> 01:25:55,382
Or kept going, you know.

1055
01:25:57,685 --> 01:26:00,384
There's nothing to
stop you out there, no.

1056
01:26:00,386 --> 01:26:03,921
Nothing to get in your way
when you look out at it all.

1057
01:26:03,923 --> 01:26:06,325
No trees, just...

1058
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:10,461
Sky and water, and
after a while you...

1059
01:26:10,463 --> 01:26:13,268
Can't tell one from the other.

1060
01:26:14,534 --> 01:26:18,402
There's nothing to shield you.

1061
01:26:18,404 --> 01:26:22,509
There's nothing to keep you
from just taking it all in.

1062
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:28,582
That's where he is now.

1063
01:26:32,552 --> 01:26:34,620
Somewhere.

1064
01:26:57,377 --> 01:26:58,412
Ma'am?

1065
01:27:01,814 --> 01:27:04,451
Was he ever happy over there?

1066
01:27:07,453 --> 01:27:08,722
Sure.

1067
01:27:11,524 --> 01:27:13,527
Why don't you
tell me about that?

1068
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:19,266
Well...

1069
01:27:23,337 --> 01:27:26,470
There was this girl he liked.

1070
01:27:26,472 --> 01:27:28,607
And, um...

1071
01:27:28,609 --> 01:27:30,308
I don't know if she
ever even knew his name,

1072
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:32,779
but he liked her.

1073
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:39,550
One time, this wasn't that
long ago, there was a party.

1074
01:27:39,552 --> 01:27:42,420
It was a Christmas party.

1075
01:27:42,422 --> 01:27:43,757
And, um...

1076
01:27:44,925 --> 01:27:47,459
And that girl was there...

1077
01:27:47,461 --> 01:27:54,433
And he was too shy
to go dance with her.

1078
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:57,501
And I kept trying to get
him to go talk to her.

1079
01:27:57,503 --> 01:28:00,472
He kept saying, "No, no, no."

1080
01:28:00,474 --> 01:28:01,676
And...

1081
01:28:04,978 --> 01:28:08,446
And then she came up to him.

1082
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:12,386
And she made him get out
there and start moving.

1083
01:28:14,654 --> 01:28:17,455
And he wasn't that good.

1084
01:28:18,992 --> 01:28:22,561
But he wasn't that bad, either.

1085
01:28:22,563 --> 01:28:25,432
And he was laughing
and smiling...

1086
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:28,866
And having a real good time.

1087
01:28:31,505 --> 01:28:35,042
And I just watched
and I could tell...

1088
01:28:37,043 --> 01:28:39,012
He was real happy then.

1089
01:28:45,519 --> 01:28:48,152
That's
what I remember.
