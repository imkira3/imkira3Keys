1
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:24,542
Fight!

2
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,750
This is definitely the wickedest thing
I ever hear in my life!

3
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:45,375
# Can't nobody do it like I do it

4
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,542
# When I do it, dawg, I do it

5
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:51,667
# Break it down, put your back into it
Y'all ain't ready for the shit I'm doin'

6
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,083
- # Get up, get up
- # How'd you change the sound?

7
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,208
# Took the other one I had,
swapped it out

8
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,250
# Kept somethin' in the background

9
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,708
# You know the song
Do it with the background

10
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,042
# Show off that body you got

11
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,125
# You got the dance flo' so hot

12
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,208
# You workin' that, you trickin' that

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,500
# You trickin' that shit like a plot

14
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,708
# Show off that body you got

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,833
# You got the dance flo' so hot

16
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:16,042
# You workin' that, you trickin' that

17
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,208
# You trickin' that shit like a plot

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,875
This is definitely the wickedest thing
I ever hear in my life!

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,208
# Get up, get up, get up

20
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:31,333
# OK, get up, get up

21
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:35,250
# You can do what you do
and do it well

22
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,250
# Can't nobody do it like I do it

23
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,666
# Do it, break it down

24
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,333
# Get up

25
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:51,875
# I'm goin' five on the Richter scale
The highest number you can roll is 12

26
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:55,041
- # Shorty, shake it like a...
- # Show off that body you got

27
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,208
# You got the dance flo' so hot

28
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,375
# You workin' that, you trickin' that

00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,916
# You got the dance flo' so hot

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
# You workin' that, you trickin' that

33
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,583
# You trickin' that shit like a plot

34
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,041
Whoo-ee!

35
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,208
Yo, Mac. Mac. Mac.

36
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,625
- What?
- Hey, man, you wanna do a lap?

37
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,125
Does it look like I need to do a lap?

38
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,875
- Just go.
- Man, this party's wack.

39
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:55,083
- Who is this guy?
- This is my little brother Skinny.

40
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,583
None other than.

41
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,791
- So, uh, how you doin'?
- Hey, man, what you doin'?

42
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:04,458
- Why don't I come back a little later?
- What? No, no...

43
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,166
You must have
the recessive genes in the family.

44
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,541
Recessive what?
Girls here is just stuck up, that's all.

45
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:14,000
- Is that what it is, Skinny?
- Let's bounce. Where's Tyler?

46
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,375
Where you think he at?

47
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,625
Yeah! Whoo!

48
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,250
- What you doin' with my girl?
- PJ, we're dancin'.

49
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:03,208
- Shut up, you bitch.
- I didn't see your name on her, man.

50
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,708
Hey, come on, PJ!

51
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,708
- Yeah, check him out!
- White boy's whoopin' on PJ!

52
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,666
Get off him!

53
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,250
- Better rethink your strategy.
- A'ight, man, you got it.

54
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,916
Come on, Tyler, let's go.
Skinny, let's go.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,291
Tyler, let's go, man.
Skinny, come on, man.

56
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,333
- Get off me!
- Go, man.

57
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,333
Why you pushin' me so much?

58
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,000
- Tyler, move!
- Stop pushin'.

59
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,708
You just wanna be Rocky.

60
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,208
- I started nothin'.
- You always finishin' it.

61
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,041
- Wanna pull guns? I'll show you mine.
- Shut up, man.

62
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:49,083
Do you feel like because you a white boy,
you got to overcompensate sometimes?

63
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,083
Wow! Wow!

64
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:56,666
- You got me all figured out, Montel.
- I may be Montel, but you Jerry Springer.

65
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,083
Yo, yo, check this out.

66
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,458
- You Montel, you Jerry Springer and I'm...
- Jenny Jones.

67
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,916
Nah. Nah, nah. Nah, man.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,708
- He's like Ellen.
- Except Ellen get more chicks.

69
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:06,874
Aah-ha-ha!

70
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,749
Hey, shut up.

71
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:15,874
I can't believe you fought PJ, man.
Hold up. That's PJ.

72
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,083
Man...

73
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,541
- What is he doin'?
- Skinny, what are you...

74
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,499
What the hell you think you doin'? Am I
the only one not tryin' to get us killed?

75
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,708
I ain't afraid of him.

76
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,624
You waited till the car got around
the corner before you threw something.

77
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,749
- That's real brave.
- I ain't afraid of nobody.

78
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,874
I ain't afraid of you
and I'm definitely not afraid of you.

79
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:42,208
- I'll throw something at you.
- That's how you miss.

80
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:45,999
Stand still, then.

81
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:48,374
- Where was it?
- There.

82
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,958
Oh...

83
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,291
Hey, yo, come on, man!
I know this place.

84
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:56,333
It's that school.

85
00:05:56,416 --> 00:06:00,083
- This don't look like no school.
- It is a school. I'll show you.

86
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,666
Skinny!

87
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,791
- He's your brother. You go get him.
- Come on.

88
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:09,583
- I ain't goin' in there.
- Come on.

89
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,666
Damn!

90
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:19,499
Watch yourself.
Come on, man.

91
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,708
Shh, shh, shh.

92
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:24,999
- This looks like a museum.
- It's not a museum.

93
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:28,416
Ty, man, quit playin', man.

94
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:32,291
Look. Skinny's right.
This is a school.

95
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:34,124
- Arts school.
- I told you.

96
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,458
- Who goes here, then?
- Look like some stuck-up rich folks.

97
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,291
Look at these dudes.

98
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:42,999
All sweet with the shirts all tight
like they spray-painted 'em on.

99
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,041
Yeah.

100
00:06:44,124 --> 00:06:46,874
It do show off their muscles
pretty nice, though.

101
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,916
- No, I'm just...
- No, no. Don't touch me.

102
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:53,124
- Mac. I'm just...
- Don't touch me.

103
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,916
I'm just sayin'
they in good shape is all.

104
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,041
- We need to get you a girl fast.
- I got girls. I just don't show 'em to ya.

105
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:02,249
- Why?
- Y'all are gonna try and take 'em.

106
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,249
- What you talkin' about?
- Check this out!

107
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,583
- Look at this place.
- We got nothin' like this in our school.

108
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:15,708
That's 'cause our school's broke.
Hey, yo, wait up.

109
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,499
These rich kids get everything.

110
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,333
What is this, man?
Seems like a playground to me.

111
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,291
# Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro

112
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:27,916
Look at this stuff.

113
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,541
Let's bounce, man.

114
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:35,166
- Skinny, what are you...?
- It was a accident.

115
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:40,208
Skinny, don't worry.
These rich kids can afford this. Look. Ha!

116
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:47,541
Look, look.

117
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:49,124
# Oh-wah...

118
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,666
- Hey, heads up!
- Whoa!

119
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:54,708
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

120
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,541
# La la la-la

121
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,124
I challenge you.

122
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,499
I win!

123
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,916
- It's a rumble.
- Aah!

124
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,333
Oof!

125
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,416
That ain't funny, man.

126
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:13,041
Look out! Whoa!

127
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,166
Hey, yo, yo, watch out!

128
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,874
Ha-ha!

129
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,333
- Having fun?
- Get off me!

130
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,041
Party's over.
You're comin' with me.

131
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:34,374
- I didn't do nothin', man. Get off...
- Go, go, go, man.

132
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,624
Yo, Ty!

133
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:40,707
Man, just go. Go!

134
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,624
- Very noble.
- Shut up, rent-a-cop!

135
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:54,207
Breaking and entering, vandalism
of the Maryland School of the Arts.

136
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:57,999
- You a student there?
- No.

137
00:08:58,082 --> 00:09:03,207
You've been in this courtroom several
times. Where are your foster parents?

138
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:07,207
- Can you answer me with a sentence?
- My foster mom's trying to get off work.

139
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:08,582
OK, Mr. Gage, look.

140
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:12,541
This is the way we play the game here.
You break it, you buy it.

141
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:16,499
200 hours of community service to be
performed at the scene of the offense -

142
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:18,499
the Maryland School of the Arts.

143
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,624
Whatever.

144
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:33,041
I got here as fast as I could.

145
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,916
We're back.

146
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:51,999
- What'd he get?
- 200 hours community service.

147
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:54,416
Won't make it.
He's never stayed with anything.

148
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:57,707
Why do you care?
You get your check every month.

149
00:09:57,749 --> 00:09:59,624
- Kids, wash up.
- What did you say?

150
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:05,832
Wait, slow down. You're makin' Bill dizzy
and he's not even drunk yet.

151
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:10,207
Guys, come on. Let's just have a nice
dinner before I have to go back to work.

152
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:12,582
I'm not hungry.

153
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,082
Hey, shut up!
I'm trying to watch this!

154
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,207
# Dress the hater,
no mask, only cape

155
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,957
# I ain't pressed for paper,
thug investigators

156
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,874
# I'm cooler than a 'frigerator,
sweeter than...

157
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:34,249
Are you going to prison?

158
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,499
How many times
do I have to tell you to knock?

159
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:39,916
That's where my dad is, at the supermax.
He liked it better at Jessup.

160
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,957
No, Camille,
I'm not goin' to prison.

161
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:47,332
But they are gonna have to take me
to prison if you don't start knocking.

162
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,374
Get outta here.

163
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:25,082
Excuse me.

164
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,499
I need that new arrangement.

165
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:44,540
I see. We were hoping to link the
fund-raiser to the fall showcase. Mm-hm.

166
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:48,374
So we absolutely
can't do it on a Friday?

167
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:50,124
I'm Tyler Gage.
I'm here to...

168
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,040
Come in, Mr. Gage.
Take a seat.

169
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:56,499
We'll just have to move the event till March
and hope the Pratts come through.

170
00:12:56,582 --> 00:12:58,290
Thanks, Denise.

171
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,165
Well, I see that you're
overwhelmed with remorse.

172
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:15,665
You have no idea of the consequences
of your actions, do you?

173
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:18,124
Yeah. 200 hours.

174
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:21,124
Actually, there's a little more to it.

175
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:24,332
Most of our students
are here on scholarship.

176
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:27,207
The cost of repairing
the damage that you did

177
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,082
is roughly the equivalent
of one student's tuition.

178
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:33,707
Do you understand
what that means?

179
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:37,374
You just cost someone their future.

180
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,915
Sorry.

181
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:44,832
Look, I'm just here to do my hours.

182
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:52,540
It says here that your school day
finishes at two.

183
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:57,582
Per the court's order, you're to report here
and stay until 5:30.

184
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:00,707
Now, if you'll follow me, Mr. Gage,

185
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,749
I have someone who is
very eager to meet you.

186
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:15,499
- Mr. McCaffrey.
- Director Gordon.

187
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:19,999
This is Tyler Gage,
your new intern.

188
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:22,624
I'd like a daily report
on his activities.

189
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:25,374
Great. Here you go.

190
00:14:31,707 --> 00:14:34,124
And stop
and bring it around front

191
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:38,624
and one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

192
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:43,332
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, go!

193
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:48,249
One, two, three, four
and five, six, seven. And up!

194
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:51,332
And now up!

195
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:59,874
Um, hello.
Who is that?

196
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:04,040
Come on, he is fine.

197
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:05,707
Don't you have a boyfriend?

198
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,374
Yes, and my boyfriend would
appreciate my good taste. Thank you.

199
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:15,249
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

200
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,540
And a-one, two and three and four.

201
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,415
Good, Nora. Six, seven.

202
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:24,040
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

203
00:15:24,082 --> 00:15:28,665
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

204
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:30,624
And one, two, three, four...

205
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:32,873
- Hey.
- Hey.

206
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:36,748
And a-one, two, three,
four and five, six, seven.

207
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:42,040
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

208
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:45,082
Good class, you guys.
Good job.

209
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:50,957
- So I'll see you at rehearsal, OK, Andrew?
- You got it.

210
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,707
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

211
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:02,623
- Walk you to your next class?
- I just gotta stop by my locker.

212
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:04,373
- All right.
- How are you?

213
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:07,915
- Good. How was class?
- It was good.

214
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:10,998
Guys, is that our new janitor?

215
00:16:11,082 --> 00:16:14,248
He's not a janitor.
That's the guy who trashed the theater.

216
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:15,957
Really?

217
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,332
Ooh.

218
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:19,832
I love a man in a uniform.

219
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:30,498
Hey.

220
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:34,040
You with the garbage-man jumpsuit.
How about a wash and wax?

221
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:37,457
Cool out.
I know that car belongs to somebody.

222
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,498
We'll leave it here
for you to drive over to Omar's.

223
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,373
And make sure he pays
for the last car we brought him.

224
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:44,415
Whassup, man?

225
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:48,415
Man, look at this thing.
I think it's got plastic spinners.

226
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:51,498
What's up with the girls here?

227
00:16:51,582 --> 00:16:54,790
Damn. They look like the girls
from the "Candy Shop" videos.

228
00:16:54,873 --> 00:16:57,998
They might look like 'em,
but they don't dance like 'em.

229
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:00,498
Oh, yeah? So, you been
workin' 'em out?

230
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:03,748
I been workin' 'em out.
I been givin' 'em something like...

231
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:06,123
Whassup?
That's what you showed 'em?

232
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:11,623
Hey, yo.

233
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:12,915
- OK.
- Whoo!

234
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:16,040
- That's whassup?
- And what they do?

235
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:18,248
Be like twinkle-toes.

236
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:20,248
Aah! Ha-ha!

237
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:27,165
What'd you do after that?

238
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:31,415
Can you please stop thinking about
the senior showcase for one second?

239
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:35,957
- It's not just that. It's everything...
- Nora. Nora! Look.

240
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,915
Got a track for the showcase. It's the same
tempo, same rhythm as the track you got,

241
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:44,915
but I really believe this'll take
your routine to the next level.

242
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,707
- Next level?
- Yeah.

243
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,082
- Thanks a lot, Miles.
- Nora, listen, wait.

244
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:55,457
- Not that it's not already at the next level...
- Quit while you're ahead. Stop.

245
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,207
I need you to stop and take a breath.
You're startin' to make me nervous.

246
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:02,207
- I know. I'm just stressed.
- You need a break.

247
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,915
Colin's playin' Saturday night.
You haven't been there forever.

248
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:09,082
- Hold on. Who's Colin?
- Lucy's older boyfriend.

249
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:12,540
- He's sophisticated. A real man.
- Sophisticated? Real man?

250
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:16,915
His butt's gonna be surrounded
by a lot of real men when he goes to jail.

251
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:19,915
How long have you had your license -
six months, seven?

252
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,790
I am very mature for my age.
Thank you.

253
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:26,832
That's great.
That's so perfect for the witness stand.

254
00:18:30,873 --> 00:18:33,207
# You can get with this
or you can get with that

255
00:18:33,248 --> 00:18:36,165
# I think you'll go with this,
'cause this is kinda phat

256
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,332
# Engine, Engine Number 9

257
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:40,873
# On the New York Transit Line

258
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:42,998
# If my train goes off the track

259
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:45,290
# Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up

260
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,790
# Back on the scene,
crispy and clean

261
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:50,457
# You can try, but don't
'cause you can't intervene

262
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,998
# We be the outcast
down for the settle

263
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:55,165
# One play rock,
one play the pebble

264
00:18:55,248 --> 00:19:00,040
# Open the door, you best believe
we're slidin' through it swift... ly

265
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:03,373
# Niftily,
we can make it hip to be

266
00:19:03,415 --> 00:19:05,748
# What we are
'cause what we be

267
00:19:05,831 --> 00:19:09,248
# Be the epitome,
doo da dippity

268
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,873
# So now I dwell
just to say you're plainer

269
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:14,248
# Hold your cup
'cause I got the container

270
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:16,498
# Pass the plate up,

271
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:19,040
# Black Sheep get played

272
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:20,831
# Never the traitor...

273
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:23,040
When are you gonna
stop changin' her music?

274
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:25,873
- I'm just tryin' to help her.
- Nora, come on.

275
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,540
Just go. Just go.

276
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:30,040
Please, come on.

277
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:37,415
Hey, man, what you doin'?

278
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,956
- Come on, man.
- They got that.

279
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,873
- Tired of gettin' dogged on yet?
- Oh, yeah. Let's go.

280
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:45,915
Whassup?

281
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:47,331
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

282
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,665
- Bounce!
- Throw that, Tyler!

283
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:52,706
Ha!

284
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:54,665
A'ight.

285
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:56,581
Pick 'em up,
pick 'em up.

286
00:19:56,665 --> 00:19:58,540
Come on, man.
Come on.

287
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,748
Hey, man,
put me down.

288
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:02,915
- Come on, man.
- Ah-ha-ha!

289
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:04,790
- Get off me!
- You playin', baby?

290
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,665
- Go!
- Mac. Mac.

291
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:13,581
Got him. Got him! Get him.

292
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:15,706
Ohh!

293
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:17,165
Whoo!

294
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:20,331
- Put my money here, baby.
- Hey, baby. Nice game.

295
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:27,623
That's wonderful, Jack.
Congratulations.

296
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:30,540
- You're late.
- Not really.

297
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:34,540
You're so eager to get to work
you're sprinting off to the supply closet?

298
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:37,831
It's 15 minutes.
Don't I get a grace period or something?

299
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:43,998
You've neither earned one, nor are you
entitled. But you can stay 15 minutes later.

300
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:55,206
Andrew, oh, my God.
What happened?

301
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,290
Came down on my ankle wrong
in class today.

302
00:20:57,373 --> 00:21:00,206
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. It's just a sprain.

303
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,790
Doctor says I have to stay off of it.
I'm really sorry.

304
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:06,790
- For what? It's not your fault.
- I know, Nora.

305
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:09,623
It's just that the showcase
means a lot to both of us.

306
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:12,915
Maybe you could find someone
to rehearse with in the meantime.

307
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:15,748
I should be back before you know it.

308
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,248
Yeah. Um...

309
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,790
Don't worry about it.
I'll be OK.

310
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:23,123
All right.
Cool. I'll see you later.

311
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:25,165
OK.

312
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,123
- What's up, man?
- 'Sup?

313
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:32,789
- Hey, where you from?
- I grew up in McCulloh Homes.

314
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:33,914
Oh, word.

315
00:22:33,956 --> 00:22:37,581
That's where my boy Mac is from.
He lives over at Heritage now, though.

316
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:38,623
Oh, yeah?

317
00:22:38,706 --> 00:22:41,456
I don't live over there no more.
I live with my aunt now.

318
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:43,831
I'll check you a little later, all right?

319
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:45,289
- A'ight.
- A'ight.

320
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:46,414
Later.

321
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:50,581
He only has a bad sprain. I need someone
to rehearse with until he gets better.

322
00:22:50,623 --> 00:22:53,873
You know all the stuff
I have going on with the labels.

323
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,998
How come Miles
can find the time to help me?

324
00:22:56,081 --> 00:23:00,456
No offense to Miles, but he's not involved
in every aspect of the music as I am.

325
00:23:00,498 --> 00:23:05,956
Look, all I need is somebody, Brett,
to rehearse with just for a couple of weeks.

326
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:09,414
I wanna help you. You know I do.
I'm just so close with my music,

327
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:12,373
I gotta give it everything I have right now.

328
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:15,748
Look, you're gonna do great.
You always do.

329
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:17,789
Yeah.

330
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:19,914
All right, sweetie.

331
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:43,623
Thank you guys so much
for coming to the audition.

332
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:45,748
- Ready?
- No!

333
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:48,956
Sorry. I'm not ready yet.

334
00:23:58,123 --> 00:23:59,331
Thank you.

335
00:24:03,123 --> 00:24:04,123
Next?

336
00:24:05,873 --> 00:24:08,206
Like this.

337
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:10,206
Jump. See?

338
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:12,706
- It's not that hard. OK?
- Yeah.

339
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:14,956
Hold me. Great.

340
00:24:23,623 --> 00:24:24,581
No.

341
00:24:29,164 --> 00:24:31,248
Thank you.

342
00:24:32,164 --> 00:24:33,914
No! Oh!

343
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:37,123
- Oh!
- I got it.

344
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:39,998
- You did it.
- No, no, no...

345
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:42,956
Thank you. Thanks.

346
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,414
I'll do it.

347
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:04,331
Do what?

348
00:25:04,414 --> 00:25:08,914
I don't know.
Whatever y'all were tryin' to do out here.

349
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:12,081
You wanna lift me?
Are you kidding?

350
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:15,998
Does it look like I'm kiddin'?

351
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:20,831
OK, I get it. You're not gonna use me
to get out of cleaning the windows,

352
00:25:20,914 --> 00:25:22,956
even if you were capable of dancing.

353
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,456
OK. I'm not trying to get out of anything
and I know you saw me the other day.

354
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:34,414
Thank you,
but I can find someone else.

355
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:37,373
OK.

356
00:25:37,456 --> 00:25:39,956
I was just tryin' to help.

357
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:44,581
OK, wait.

358
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,039
Catch me.

359
00:25:59,623 --> 00:26:00,998
Now what?

360
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:02,581
Um, um...

361
00:26:02,664 --> 00:26:04,164
Put me down.

362
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:06,539
No. What about
choreographing a solo?

363
00:26:06,622 --> 00:26:09,581
I don't have time to work out a solo.
Not a good one, anyway.

364
00:26:09,664 --> 00:26:11,872
Have you talked to the sophomores?

365
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:15,039
I've auditioned a bunch of them.
None of them can handle it.

366
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:19,247
My dance has a lot of lifts in it
and you know how hard the...

367
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:23,956
- I can't believe there's no one else.
- None who have the time.

368
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,664
And you say that he can dance?

369
00:26:26,747 --> 00:26:30,122
- He's adequate.
- Adequate?

370
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:33,664
See, that's my concern.
He's not taking this seriously.

371
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:36,122
Look, I'm sorry.

372
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:41,247
It's just you all be talkin' about dancin'
like it's rocket science or something.

373
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:44,414
It's just for a couple of weeks
until Andrew gets better.

374
00:26:44,497 --> 00:26:46,581
Yeah.

375
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:50,206
This would be your risk, Nora.

376
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:52,581
It's your senior piece.

377
00:26:52,622 --> 00:26:54,914
I know.

378
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:57,622
Don't make me regret my decision.

379
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:03,164
2:30 tomorrow.
Bring your tights.

380
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,122
Tights? Wait, what?

381
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:08,706
Aah!

382
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:10,831
I'm gonna beat you.

383
00:27:12,372 --> 00:27:15,122
Anything interesting
happen in school today?

384
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:16,289
Malcolm, enough.

385
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:17,456
No.

386
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,581
Sit down. Thank you.

387
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:22,247
Eat.

388
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:27,914
Mm...

389
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:31,289
Anything special at school today?

390
00:27:31,372 --> 00:27:33,497
I found a rehearsal partner,

391
00:27:33,581 --> 00:27:37,956
so now I won't miss a beat
when Andrew gets back.

392
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:43,372
Your applications arrived from Cornell
and Brown. I put them on your bed.

393
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:47,081
Remember our deal, Nora.
If you don't get a job from the showcase,

394
00:27:47,122 --> 00:27:50,164
you go to school in the fall.

395
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:53,414
OK.

396
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:18,247
I'm not late.

397
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:21,581
You're not dressed, either.
You can change in the bathroom.

398
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,122
Done.

399
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:31,414
- I asked you to bring tights.
- Do I look like I own tights?

400
00:28:31,456 --> 00:28:34,414
- Shoes?
- Move better with 'em on.

401
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:37,039
Afraid you might slip and fall?

402
00:28:43,331 --> 00:28:46,622
- How you wanna do this?
- I'll start with a combination.

403
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,706
OK.

404
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:57,164
Step, knee, step, fan,

405
00:28:57,247 --> 00:29:01,622
step, turn, ball change, contract.

406
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:06,289
- OK?
- Mm-hm.

407
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:08,997
I'll take it slow.

408
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,872
And... step, knee,

409
00:29:11,956 --> 00:29:14,581
step, fan, and...

410
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:17,164
- You got that?
- Yeah.

411
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:19,081
So, from the fan...

412
00:29:19,122 --> 00:29:22,706
turn, ball change, contract.

413
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:27,456
OK. Um...

414
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:29,456
Let's do it again.

415
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:33,914
Five, six, seven, eight. Step, knee...

416
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,372
Oh. My bad.

417
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,747
No. Uh, so... Go.

418
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:42,289
Step, knee, fan...

419
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,789
Wow.

420
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:48,247
He looks like the real deal.

421
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:52,247
- Take a break. Grab a coffee with me.
- I can't. I have a lot to do.

422
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:54,497
- That's for damn sure.
- Brett...

423
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,080
- I'm sorry. You got a problem?
- No. No, I'm all about rehabilitation.

424
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,955
- We could discuss this outside.
- Why do you think you're so tough?

425
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,580
- Why don't you test me?
- OK, stop.

426
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:08,539
Brett, everything's OK, all right?

427
00:30:08,622 --> 00:30:10,539
I'll meet you later.

428
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,497
- OK.
- OK.

429
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:29,080
- What?
- Again.

430
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:30,622
And...

431
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,455
Yo, Omar!

432
00:30:45,497 --> 00:30:47,914
Your boys are here, man!

433
00:30:53,122 --> 00:30:55,372
O, look what we got for you, man.

434
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,622
Let's go, baby.

435
00:31:00,622 --> 00:31:03,539
- I heard you havin' a party on Friday.
- Mm-hm.

436
00:31:03,622 --> 00:31:06,747
- Yeah, you know we up in there.
- Uh-uh.

437
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:10,455
You dudes is froze out,
especially after what happened last time.

438
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:13,955
- What you mean, we froze out?
- I ain't start that. That was PJ.

439
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,205
That ain't even right.

440
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:18,747
We can take this car to Stuckey's.
Probably get more money, too.

441
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:21,247
I'm sorry. Yeah.

442
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:24,330
You could take this car to Stuckey's.

443
00:31:24,414 --> 00:31:30,289
You know something, Mac? You young
dudes ain't got no respect. No loyalty.

444
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,789
Why don't you bring me a Escalade or
something to get back in my good graces?

445
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:37,039
- We just got you this car.
- An Escalade.

446
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:39,705
- We'll get you an Escalade.
- What did you say?

447
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:42,914
- Nothin', man.
- Yeah, nothing.

448
00:31:42,955 --> 00:31:45,080
So, can I still come to the party?

449
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:48,122
- Skinny, come on!
- He ain't say nothin' about me.

450
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:52,414
He said y'all couldn't go to the party.
He didn't say nothin' about Skinny.

451
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:54,080
Will you shut up?

452
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:58,747
Ready? Down, up, step, turn.

453
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:01,622
- Piqué and...
- What the hell is a piqué?

454
00:32:02,205 --> 00:32:04,205
This is a piqué.

455
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:08,455
We do the turn
and land face to face, OK?

456
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:10,080
- I get it...
- Do it again.

457
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:11,955
- It's just...
- What?

458
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:16,164
It's just stiff.
This whole thing is stiff. It's boring.

459
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,414
Boring?

460
00:32:18,455 --> 00:32:21,997
Don't look at me like I'm stupid.
I know you know what I'm sayin'.

461
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:26,247
Fine. Well, that's the way it is, so...

462
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,997
Fine.

463
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:30,455
Ready? And...

464
00:32:30,497 --> 00:32:31,914
Down, up...

465
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:36,080
step, turn, piqué, and...

466
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,455
- Like this?
- Um...

467
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,455
OK, I am starving.

468
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,872
Tyler's just here until Andrew's back.

469
00:32:46,955 --> 00:32:50,414
And why is this the first time
I'm hearin' about it?

470
00:32:52,455 --> 00:32:54,039
We still have work to do.

471
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:56,039
Wait. I can't watch?
Is he that bad...?

472
00:32:56,122 --> 00:32:58,747
- Goodbye.
- You can tell me!

473
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,413
OK.

474
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,038
OK, um...

475
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:12,747
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

476
00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:14,788
OK.

477
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,955
Can you come to the club
and hear me sing with Colin on Saturday?

478
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:21,955
Ooh, maybe you can bring Tyler.

479
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:24,080
Can you stop talking
about how hot he is?

480
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:29,122
OK, Brett's not around, so why do you
keep denying the obvious? It's so obvious.

481
00:33:29,163 --> 00:33:32,372
OK, fine. Tyler's good looking,
but he's annoying.

482
00:33:32,455 --> 00:33:36,247
See? Your guard's up,
and that must mean that you like him.

483
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:39,247
- You couldn't be more wrong.
- Ooh!

484
00:33:39,288 --> 00:33:40,830
And defensive, too.

485
00:33:40,913 --> 00:33:44,913
You know, that must mean that you,
um... really, really like him.

486
00:33:46,622 --> 00:33:49,080
I'm just sayin'.

487
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:51,747
Look. Miles sent me another MP3.

488
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,955
Ugh.

489
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,830
Better listen to it now. He'll call
in five minutes, askin' what you think.

490
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:00,455
You've been gettin' on
Miles' case a lot lately.

491
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,288
Because he's irritating.

492
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:03,372
Ooh.

493
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:08,080
- Defensive. What does that mean again?
- Just listen to the track, OK?

494
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:14,830
Hm.

495
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,955
It's good.

496
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:20,788
Whatever.

497
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:23,288
# Whoa-oa-oa

498
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,913
# Step, step, step up
Step, step, step up

499
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:29,872
- This.
- This is better.

500
00:34:29,955 --> 00:34:32,663
# You step up,
I'll step up, boy

501
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:35,413
# 'Cause I'm tryin'
to be with you forever...

502
00:34:35,455 --> 00:34:37,872
# No matter what we go through

503
00:34:37,955 --> 00:34:40,288
# You step up,
I'll step up, too

504
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,622
# It don't matter what the haters say
Long as you are my boo

505
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:46,872
# No matter how hard it gets

506
00:34:46,955 --> 00:34:48,955
# This love will have no regrets

507
00:34:49,038 --> 00:34:52,747
# As long as when we steppin'
on the dance floor, it's me and you

508
00:34:52,788 --> 00:34:54,913
# The rhythm of the beat,
that's my heart

509
00:34:54,955 --> 00:34:57,288
# Cupid shot me
with an arrow from the start

510
00:34:57,372 --> 00:34:59,622
# It's your love
that's got me trapped

511
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:01,747
# Every time I try to leave,
you bring me back

512
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:05,663
# So much water,
at times I've cried a river...

513
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:09,122
I'm so serious.
If you don't stop laughing...

514
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:11,122
OK, no!

515
00:35:12,622 --> 00:35:14,247
- Are you serious?
- Ready?

516
00:35:14,288 --> 00:35:17,080
# You step up,
I'll step up, too...

517
00:35:18,622 --> 00:35:21,163
Whatever.

518
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:22,872
I'm sorry.

519
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,955
# This love will have no regrets

520
00:35:25,038 --> 00:35:29,080
# As long as when we steppin'
on the dance floor, it's me and you

521
00:35:29,122 --> 00:35:32,080
# When I step into place,
I feel my feet

522
00:35:32,122 --> 00:35:34,455
# Lifting from under me

523
00:35:34,538 --> 00:35:39,205
# You grab my hands,
spin me around and right before I fall

524
00:35:39,288 --> 00:35:41,163
# You catch me and you say

525
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:45,038
# Just look into my eyes
and we will make another day

526
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:49,580
# Boy, no matter what we go through,
this love will have no regrets...

527
00:35:49,622 --> 00:35:50,622
What next?

528
00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:52,747
Six, seven, eight.

529
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:58,538
Piqué and grab...

530
00:35:58,622 --> 00:36:00,080
# No...

531
00:36:00,622 --> 00:36:02,705
# Boy, no matter...

532
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:03,788
Turn, down.

533
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,288
# You step up,
I'll step up, too

534
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,580
# It don't matter
what the haters say

535
00:36:08,622 --> 00:36:10,580
# Long as you are my boo

536
00:36:10,622 --> 00:36:13,247
# As long as when we steppin'
on the dance floor

537
00:36:13,288 --> 00:36:15,913
# It's me and you

538
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:29,747
Lena got Cap'n Crunch.

539
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:33,621
Peanut butter Cap'n Crunch.
Told you she likes us.

540
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:37,413
- Camille, would you get outta here?
- Fine.

541
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:40,455
- It's not my fault!
- It is your fault...

542
00:36:40,538 --> 00:36:42,746
Camille, come here for a second.

543
00:36:42,788 --> 00:36:44,871
Shut up.

544
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,621
You gonna give me a little bit of that?

545
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,038
One bite.

546
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:54,121
One. One bite.

547
00:36:55,788 --> 00:36:57,205
Hurry up.

548
00:36:57,288 --> 00:37:00,080
That was the biggest bite I've ever seen.

549
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:02,496
Get your own.

550
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:06,955
I spit on that spoon.
Yeah, now you give it back.

551
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:08,455
What... What is this?

552
00:37:08,538 --> 00:37:11,163
- That's a sliding scale.
- What does that mean?

553
00:37:11,246 --> 00:37:14,371
That means I scored more points than you,
so I get more money.

554
00:37:14,455 --> 00:37:15,413
No, no, no.

555
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:18,705
What about my assists?
I was droppin' dimes today.

556
00:37:18,788 --> 00:37:21,121
- You tripped over your own shoes.
- Twice.

557
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:24,871
You rolled out of the second one.
You played it off cool.

558
00:37:24,955 --> 00:37:28,288
- You better give me some more money.
- What?

559
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,538
It's getting late.
I gotta bounce.

560
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:34,246
- Wait, hold on. We'll give you a ride.
- Yo, let me do it this time.

561
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,830
- Skinny, you the lookout.
- Why can't I do it this time?

562
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,455
- Can you do it?
- Yeah.

563
00:37:41,746 --> 00:37:43,538
Let him do it, then.

564
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:46,080
You know what?

565
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:48,580
Here you go, tough guy.

566
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:51,496
See that car right there?
Go get 'em.

567
00:37:56,663 --> 00:37:59,621
- That car has got an alarm on it.
- I know.

568
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,246
He failed.

569
00:38:19,955 --> 00:38:22,663
Yo, I told you that alarm
was gonna go off.

570
00:38:22,746 --> 00:38:25,413
Wait a minute.
Y'all set me up?

571
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,371
Hold up. I got us one.

572
00:38:29,455 --> 00:38:32,621
You shoulda saw your face.

573
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:34,080
Tsk.

574
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,830
# Can't say I ever felt the way I felt

575
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:58,538
- # When we were makin'...
- # Love

576
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:01,330
# Can't stand the thought
that you were mine, but now you're...

577
00:39:01,413 --> 00:39:02,913
# For the takin'

578
00:39:02,955 --> 00:39:06,205
# I realize that we were one,
but now we're two

579
00:39:06,288 --> 00:39:11,496
# You traded us for something
just to pass the time, babe

580
00:39:12,705 --> 00:39:15,621
- That was good. Play it back, Miles?
- I like that.

581
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:19,746
Nora.

582
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,580
Yo, look who's here.

583
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:23,246
Sorry, bro.
Closed studio.

584
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,121
Yeah, OK, "bro".

585
00:39:25,205 --> 00:39:29,288
- You're an hour late.
- Yeah. My bad. I got caught up.

586
00:39:29,371 --> 00:39:30,538
For an hour?

587
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:34,080
Yeah. I had things I had to do.
I'm sorry. Can't we rehearse now?

588
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,580
No. There's other dancers
in the studio now. We can't.

589
00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:40,621
Why you gettin' mad at me?
I'm here every single day.

590
00:39:40,705 --> 00:39:43,246
- I said I'm sorry.
- Sorry's not gonna cut it.

591
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,580
Yeah, we're workin' here, man.
Some of us take this seriously.

592
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:52,288
Mm-hm.

593
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:31,954
- Where were you?
- Where was I when?

594
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,371
When we were supposed
to be rehearsing?

595
00:40:34,454 --> 00:40:38,121
I don't think the rehearsing thing
is gonna work out for me.

596
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:42,329
- What the hell does that mean?
- That means I'm out.

597
00:40:42,413 --> 00:40:47,454
What?! Are you kidding me? You just quit
without even talking to me about it?

598
00:40:47,538 --> 00:40:49,913
Yeah, sorry.

599
00:40:49,954 --> 00:40:52,329
Look, I gotta get back to work.

600
00:40:52,413 --> 00:40:56,621
I can't believe this. I can't believe
I trusted you. That was so stupid.

601
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,913
People make stupid decisions every day.

602
00:40:59,954 --> 00:41:03,788
Besides, it didn't look
like you needed me, anyway.

603
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:22,079
Mac, get your feet off the table.

604
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:24,246
Marcus, get your feet off my table.

605
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:27,579
- Told you, boy.
- Mom!

606
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:31,788
Don't leave this house. I don't wanna
hear about you getting into trouble.

607
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:34,621
- We ain't goin' nowhere, Mom.
- That's right.

608
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:38,121
I'll be back home in time
to make y'all's breakfast.

609
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,704
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Mrs. Carter.

610
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:44,413
Ah, man.

611
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,371
Look, look, weak crossover.

612
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:57,288
- You think you're as good as these guys?
- Please.

613
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:59,163
Why don't you try out?

614
00:41:59,246 --> 00:42:00,663
- For the And1 team?
- Mm-hm.

615
00:42:00,746 --> 00:42:05,579
- Why would I need to do that for?
- You should play for the school team.

616
00:42:05,621 --> 00:42:06,913
The school team?

617
00:42:06,954 --> 00:42:11,246
- Yeah, right. They suck. Never.
- Maybe they wouldn't suck if you played.

618
00:42:11,288 --> 00:42:13,288
Is this part of your community service?

619
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:17,913
What you gonna say next? "This is your
brain on drugs"? Man, forget with that.

620
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:24,163
- I'm just sayin'...
- All right, man. Just drop it.

621
00:42:25,454 --> 00:42:30,288
Don't see you out tryin' to do nothin'.
You quit everything you start. You know it.

622
00:42:34,038 --> 00:42:38,288
- That's me right there.
- Put it in slow motion, too.

623
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:41,371
Oh, baby...

624
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:48,788
Nora?

625
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:52,663
Where have you been?
It's getting late.

626
00:42:52,746 --> 00:42:54,329
Where do you think, Mom?

627
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:57,288
You've been rehearsing a lot.
What about your schoolwork?

628
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:01,913
Rehearsing is the most important part of
my schoolwork. It's kind of the whole point.

629
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,038
Sweetie, I just don't think that dancing...

630
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:07,246
Dancing is what?
What do you know about it?

631
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:10,163
When was the last time
you saw me dance?

632
00:43:10,246 --> 00:43:12,913
That's not fair.

633
00:43:12,954 --> 00:43:15,746
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

634
00:43:15,788 --> 00:43:18,954
The guy I've rehearsed with
for the showcase quit today.

635
00:43:19,038 --> 00:43:21,663
So basically, I'm screwed.

636
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:26,079
You might get your dream after all.

637
00:43:27,663 --> 00:43:30,204
You gotta come to rehearsal.

638
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:35,412
Nora.

639
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:38,829
Wait a minute.
Can you hold on a second?

640
00:43:38,912 --> 00:43:42,121
Look, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about yesterday.

641
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:47,871
- You don't feel like mopping floors today?
- Look, can you just give me a break?

642
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:52,537
Do you have any idea how important this
showcase is? Who's going to be there?

643
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:55,579
- I don't know. People?
- People?

644
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:59,954
Important people from every
major dance company in the country.

645
00:43:59,996 --> 00:44:03,787
Without this showcase,
I have nothing. I go nowhere.

646
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:08,787
OK. All right, I get it.
I know all about havin' nothin'. It sucks.

647
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:11,329
- It does.
- So are we gonna go back to doin' this?

648
00:44:11,412 --> 00:44:12,912
- No.
- No?

649
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:17,079
- I don't trust you.
- What do I gotta do to prove it to you?

650
00:44:17,912 --> 00:44:20,454
Look, I'll do anything.

651
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:23,871
Anything?

652
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:29,371
And up and grand plié
all the way to the ground.

653
00:44:29,454 --> 00:44:34,787
Back up and reach your arm up high.
Touch the sky.

654
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:39,829
Down forward, touch your toes.
And back up.

655
00:44:41,954 --> 00:44:43,579
Shh!

656
00:44:44,037 --> 00:44:47,329
And pointe and second.

657
00:44:47,412 --> 00:44:50,079
And plié...

658
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:52,246
Good. Plié...

659
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:54,287
Shh!

660
00:44:54,746 --> 00:44:57,121
I thought she was gonna
slap me in my face.

661
00:44:58,037 --> 00:44:59,996
Well, this is me.

662
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,079
OK. Why are you teachin' ballet class?
It doesn't look like you need a job.

663
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:08,746
Oh, you know, it just puts off
coming home a little longer.

664
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:11,246
It couldn't be that bad.

665
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:14,454
My mom doesn't get
the whole dancing thing.

666
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:17,454
- What about your dad?
- He died a couple years ago.

667
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:21,871
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK.

668
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:24,704
He was the one
who always encouraged me.

669
00:45:24,787 --> 00:45:27,746
Driving me to rehearsals,
watching all my routines.

670
00:45:28,412 --> 00:45:30,079
Sounds like a cool dude.

671
00:45:31,787 --> 00:45:35,621
- Thanks for walking me home.
- All right. Later.

672
00:45:35,662 --> 00:45:37,746
Bye.

673
00:45:39,162 --> 00:45:42,954
Pickup game tomorrow at the courts.
Them cats want a rematch. You down?

674
00:45:43,037 --> 00:45:47,912
I can't make that. I got community service
every day this week, man.

675
00:45:49,871 --> 00:45:52,412
Hey, put that away.
What are you doin'?

676
00:45:53,162 --> 00:45:56,787
Whassup between you and Lucy?
Look like she's kind of feeling you.

677
00:45:56,871 --> 00:45:59,579
- I don't know about that.
- What, you scared?

678
00:45:59,621 --> 00:46:02,287
Luce, Colin is too old for you.
What are you doing?

679
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:04,287
- It was so...
- Cheesy?

680
00:46:04,371 --> 00:46:07,037
Romantic, OK?
It was romantic...

681
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:12,204
- Why isn't Nora using this?
- Nora's old-school, man.

682
00:46:12,287 --> 00:46:17,079
I ain't talkin' Sugarhill Gang.
I'm talkin' 'bout Vivaldi old-school. For real.

683
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:21,454
You should let her listen to it.
Hey, Nora. I want you to hear somethin'.

684
00:46:21,537 --> 00:46:25,079
- Don't start.
- You guys seem to be gettin' along well.

685
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:28,496
- He's my partner.
- Ah, he's just your partner.

686
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:30,787
And too many things.

687
00:46:32,037 --> 00:46:36,371
Miles got... What's that, violin?
Some kids to play violin on the track.

688
00:46:36,454 --> 00:46:39,412
Finally working with people
that can play instruments.

689
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:43,621
I can play, all right.
I just prefer to play with myself.

690
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:44,954
Whoa. What?

691
00:46:45,787 --> 00:46:49,579
- He makes it too easy.
- No, not play with...

692
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:51,037
Just listen.

693
00:46:59,204 --> 00:47:01,245
I like it.

694
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:04,870
I really like it. It's good.

695
00:47:04,954 --> 00:47:08,870
Told you, dawg.
Hey, I was thinkin', um...

696
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:11,870
You know that turn
where we have our legs behind us?

697
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:15,412
Thinkin', you know,
what if I went down,

698
00:47:15,495 --> 00:47:18,079
and then we, like,
change levels, like?

699
00:47:18,162 --> 00:47:20,537
I just... I don't mean to be out of line...

700
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,954
No, no. It's cool.

701
00:47:23,537 --> 00:47:25,954
I like it.
Let's try it. Ready?

702
00:47:25,995 --> 00:47:28,120
Five, six, seven, eight.

703
00:47:28,204 --> 00:47:32,079
One, two, three, four.

704
00:47:32,454 --> 00:47:34,954
- That's actually really good.
- Cool.

705
00:47:34,995 --> 00:47:37,495
I think we should do it.

706
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:40,454
Let's try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.

707
00:47:43,954 --> 00:47:46,870
I guess I'll just see you tomorrow, then.

708
00:47:46,954 --> 00:47:49,037
- OK.
- All right.

709
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,745
You need a ride?

710
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,204
Um...

711
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:57,287
You ever even been out to Hampden?

712
00:47:57,912 --> 00:48:00,329
No, but there's a place I go near there.

713
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,162
I'm serious.
Where are you takin' me?

714
00:48:10,245 --> 00:48:12,870
Hold on.
I'm about to show you.

715
00:48:12,954 --> 00:48:15,662
Hold it. Is this...
Is this where you kill me?

716
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:17,329
Funny.

717
00:48:23,662 --> 00:48:25,495
This is it.

718
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,745
Yeah. I mean...

719
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:38,204
I got a view just like this,
you know, from my balcony.

720
00:48:38,287 --> 00:48:41,745
- You do?
- No.

721
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:47,037
- How did you find this place?
- I been comin' here since I was a kid.

722
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,287
My dad was an executive
at one of the shipping companies.

723
00:48:51,787 --> 00:48:54,245
This is where
I imagined my whole routine.

724
00:48:54,287 --> 00:48:56,704
I don't know how you do it.

725
00:48:56,787 --> 00:49:01,579
How you think about
how two people are gonna move and...

726
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:05,662
I don't know, every detail.
I couldn't do that.

727
00:49:05,745 --> 00:49:09,120
- You've been doing it.
- It's not the same thing, though.

728
00:49:09,204 --> 00:49:11,454
That's how it starts.

729
00:49:12,454 --> 00:49:15,579
I always saw this routine
with a bunch of other dancers.

730
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,454
What do you mean?

731
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:22,579
Well, if I had enough dancers,
I could have them all starting in unison

732
00:49:22,662 --> 00:49:24,787
and then slowly
breaking out in a canon.

733
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,037
Whoa, what's...

734
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,787
- What's a canon?
- You know, like "Row Your Boat"?

735
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:36,620
OK, I'll show you. You know
that phrase with the turn and lift?

736
00:49:37,162 --> 00:49:39,537
They all have turn and lifts.

737
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:44,787
All right, what, in the middle section?
Yeah, I know it.

738
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:48,120
Instead of doing it together,
you're gonna go first.

739
00:49:49,745 --> 00:49:51,537
- Come on.
- All right.

740
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:54,579
OK, go on "one".

741
00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:56,662
Five, six, seven, eight.

742
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:59,329
- # When I'm with you
- # When I'm with you

743
00:49:59,412 --> 00:50:02,287
# You know you make my days

744
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:05,204
# So beautiful

745
00:50:05,287 --> 00:50:08,662
# With your different ways

746
00:50:08,745 --> 00:50:11,620
- # You make me lighter
- # Yeah

747
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:14,745
- # I'm movin' with the wind
- # Movin' with the wind

748
00:50:14,787 --> 00:50:19,412
# Love, you know what you've got for me,
I've got for you, too

749
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:21,662
# We can't pretend

750
00:50:21,745 --> 00:50:24,329
# Give me another chance to breathe in

751
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:27,454
# You got all the things I need and

752
00:50:27,537 --> 00:50:30,620
# Together, we're just so complete

753
00:50:30,703 --> 00:50:33,745
# You must be the reason I'm alive

754
00:50:33,787 --> 00:50:35,370
# Give me another chance...

755
00:50:35,453 --> 00:50:36,995
Um...

756
00:50:37,078 --> 00:50:39,912
# You got all the things I need and

757
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,453
# Together, we're just so complete...

758
00:50:42,495 --> 00:50:45,328
Um... I, um...

759
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:49,912
If you saw it with a bunch of dancers,
you should do it with a bunch of dancers.

760
00:50:49,995 --> 00:50:52,370
Where would I find these dancers?

761
00:50:52,453 --> 00:50:56,537
You go to a school bustin' with
kids in tights. Take your pick.

762
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:01,078
The only ones left are sophomores
and freshmen. They're not good enough.

763
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,245
How do you know
if they're good enough or not?

764
00:51:04,287 --> 00:51:07,120
You didn't know I was good enough.

765
00:51:07,203 --> 00:51:09,370
Well, who says you are?

766
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,620
All right...

767
00:51:17,662 --> 00:51:19,287
Uh-huh.

768
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,078
I'm being kept in the ninth grade.

769
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,370
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

770
00:51:25,453 --> 00:51:28,620
- Let's go. You ready?
- I can't. I'm late for my hours.

771
00:51:28,703 --> 00:51:31,120
- What about our game?
- I'll do it tomorrow.

772
00:51:31,162 --> 00:51:33,787
You said that yesterday.

773
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,912
Yo, I'm gonna catch y'all later.

774
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:39,662
Now I'm gettin' pissed.

775
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,245
How many did you say you needed?

776
00:52:13,328 --> 00:52:15,620
Thanks, Miles.

777
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,703
So, um, that's basically
what we have so far.

778
00:52:21,287 --> 00:52:23,912
Congratulations.

779
00:52:23,953 --> 00:52:26,203
You've really expanded your range.

780
00:52:26,703 --> 00:52:29,453
I thought your original piece was good,

781
00:52:29,537 --> 00:52:31,578
but this...

782
00:52:31,662 --> 00:52:34,787
This is very risky, Nora.

783
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:39,037
But it may pay off. What made you
decide to change your piece?

784
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,078
- Actually, a lot of this is Tyler.
- Nah, it's all you.

785
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:47,078
OK, fine. He gave me some of his moves
and I gave him ballet lessons.

786
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,745
You've studied ballet?

787
00:52:49,787 --> 00:52:53,412
He's actually pretty good.
He could be a student here.

788
00:52:53,453 --> 00:52:57,787
Unfortunately, our school year has
already begun, but keep up the good work.

789
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,245
Mm, Miles. Miles!

790
00:53:08,328 --> 00:53:11,953
- Lucy, not right now.
- What's wrong? Miles.

791
00:53:12,037 --> 00:53:15,245
Miles, what's wrong?
I heard you guys got signed.

792
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:18,203
- You heard wrong.
- Everybody says Brett got signed...

793
00:53:18,287 --> 00:53:21,953
- Brett signed without me.
- How'd he get signed without you?

794
00:53:22,037 --> 00:53:24,703
According to him,
the label says he's the only talent.

795
00:53:24,787 --> 00:53:28,370
They wanna put him out as a solo artist
to work with other producers.

796
00:53:28,453 --> 00:53:30,412
- Oh, my God...
- You know what?

797
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,578
I knew Brett had an ego.
I knew he did.

798
00:53:32,662 --> 00:53:36,412
But, damn, I thought he would sit me down
and tell me like a man.

799
00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:45,620
I knew it.

800
00:53:51,078 --> 00:53:52,412
Hey, baby.

801
00:53:52,453 --> 00:53:54,828
Is that why you flew
to New York last week?

802
00:53:54,912 --> 00:53:56,120
Nora, calm down.

803
00:53:56,203 --> 00:54:02,078
You ditched Miles? After all the work you
did together, you dump him just like that?

804
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,828
You haven't heard my side of the story.

805
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:09,411
You don't have time to tell your girlfriend.
I have to find out through everyone else.

806
00:54:09,495 --> 00:54:13,370
Nora, come on. I'm sorry.
I didn't expect it to happen like this.

807
00:54:13,453 --> 00:54:17,203
It's just happening. All right?
Like we always talked about.

808
00:54:17,286 --> 00:54:20,120
We never talked about
stepping on our friends.

809
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:23,453
When you're handed your dream,
you take it. You don't ask questions.

810
00:54:23,536 --> 00:54:25,453
- I would.
- You think you would.

811
00:54:25,536 --> 00:54:27,953
But you don't know
until it's right in front of you.

812
00:54:28,036 --> 00:54:30,786
Seriously, would you
have walked away?

813
00:54:31,953 --> 00:54:34,453
I don't know...

814
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,661
but I'm walking away now.

815
00:54:36,745 --> 00:54:39,036
- You're breaking up with me?
- Yes.

816
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,245
This isn't about me or Miles or any of that.
It's about Tyler, isn't it?

817
00:54:43,286 --> 00:54:45,453
No, it's about me, Brett.

818
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:47,870
Fine.

819
00:54:47,953 --> 00:54:51,578
Remember, that loser's
headed nowhere fast and you know it.

820
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,245
Miss Gordon...
I mean, Director Gordon?

821
00:55:04,328 --> 00:55:07,078
Can I help you, Tyler?

822
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,328
Um...

823
00:55:08,411 --> 00:55:11,661
There's something
that I kinda wanted to, um...

824
00:55:14,953 --> 00:55:18,411
- It's probably stupid.
- Then perhaps it can wait.

825
00:55:18,453 --> 00:55:21,786
You know how me and Nora
have been working together?

826
00:55:21,828 --> 00:55:27,745
It's been... kinda making me think lately
that... maybe I'd like to come here.

827
00:55:29,453 --> 00:55:34,036
- You want to apply to the school?
- Yeah. Kids transfer, don't they?

828
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:39,453
I was kinda hopin' maybe I could
finish out my school year here.

829
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:45,286
It's not that you don't have talent, Tyler.

830
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:49,036
But a lot of kids have talent.
It takes so much more than that.

831
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,620
This is a grueling program. My students
work themselves into the ground every day

832
00:55:53,703 --> 00:55:58,536
just to get a fraction closer to their goals.
We're tough as hell on them in here,

833
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,911
because we know what they're
going to face out there.

834
00:56:01,953 --> 00:56:04,786
Only kids that make it
are the ones prepared to fight.

835
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,786
Yeah, I understand that.

836
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:11,578
I'm not sure that you do,
not for something real.

837
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,828
And I've already seen you
give up once already.

838
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:18,911
- That's not gonna happen again.
- Saying the words doesn't make it so.

839
00:56:18,995 --> 00:56:20,953
Then tell me what I gotta do.

840
00:56:20,995 --> 00:56:24,495
I can't.
You have to show me.

841
00:56:24,578 --> 00:56:28,995
Show me that you want it,
really want it.

842
00:56:29,078 --> 00:56:32,953
You do that,
then we can talk.

843
00:56:35,286 --> 00:56:39,120
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a 3:00.

844
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,745
Unh...

845
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:53,536
# Whoo-oo-oo

846
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,078
# Whoo-oo-oo

847
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,620
# I got this girl

848
00:56:57,661 --> 00:57:01,870
# And she's the only thing
that can drive me insane...

849
00:57:03,828 --> 00:57:06,953
Come on, man.
Will you snap out of it?

850
00:57:07,036 --> 00:57:10,745
All right, look, way I look at it,
Brett did you a favor.

851
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:13,286
Your beats are hotter
than what he can do with 'em.

852
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:16,786
# It's a crime to admit
that she ain't ten times legit

853
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:19,120
# My friend,
she's hotter than shh...

854
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:21,370
# Her sun is shinin' on me

855
00:57:21,453 --> 00:57:24,495
# Anybody that got somethin' so fine

856
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:27,245
# Now's the time to acknowledge

857
00:57:27,328 --> 00:57:30,161
# Ohh, ooh...

858
00:57:30,286 --> 00:57:34,036
- Come on, man.
- I gotta sit up here and watch this Colin?

859
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:37,828
Did we come here for him?
I thought we came here for Lucy.

860
00:57:37,911 --> 00:57:42,369
Is that who you been looking at?
He is kinda hot, in that weird way...

861
00:57:42,453 --> 00:57:44,286
Shut up, man. Shut up.

862
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:49,453
# I got it made in the sun, baby

863
00:57:49,494 --> 00:57:53,828
# Made in the sun, sugar
Made in the sun, honey

864
00:57:57,453 --> 00:58:00,578
# Oh, baby

865
00:58:04,828 --> 00:58:07,953
Thank you. We're gonna take a break.
Be back in five.

866
00:58:08,036 --> 00:58:09,578
Sounds great, fellas.

867
00:58:13,036 --> 00:58:14,911
I gotta get up outta here, man.

868
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:17,953
Hey, guys.
Have you met my boyfriend?

869
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,703
Hey, man. I'm Colin.

870
00:58:19,786 --> 00:58:21,911
Tyler. Nice to meet you, man.

871
00:58:21,994 --> 00:58:23,744
- This is Miles.
- What's up, man?

872
00:58:23,828 --> 00:58:27,578
Miles. This is the guy
you told me about.

873
00:58:28,244 --> 00:58:30,953
She said you played.
Got a set up if you wanna join us.

874
00:58:31,036 --> 00:58:36,078
- Oh, no. I left my G4 at home, man.
- It's in his bag.

875
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:37,953
Yeah?

876
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:41,286
Come on, man,
we're set up. Ready, Luce?

877
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:44,911
Dude think he slick trying to use
that reverse-psychology shit.

878
00:58:44,953 --> 00:58:47,619
- He seems kinda cool.
- That's part of his whole game.

879
00:58:47,703 --> 00:58:49,453
Man, just go play.

880
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:51,536
- How are you?
- OK.

881
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:04,286
- Hey.
- Hey.

882
00:59:04,328 --> 00:59:06,036
I didn't think you'd come...

883
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:08,744
- That's exactly why I wanted to come.
- Yeah?

884
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:11,744
- What are you doing here?
- Miles needed a wingman.

885
00:59:12,828 --> 00:59:14,078
Oh.

886
00:59:14,161 --> 00:59:17,119
What's he doing up there?

887
00:59:17,161 --> 00:59:19,744
Trying to be the bigger man.

888
00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:22,078
OK.

889
00:59:22,703 --> 00:59:25,369
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

890
00:59:25,453 --> 00:59:27,286
Is everybody ready?
Let's do this.

891
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,911
# Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

892
00:59:34,953 --> 00:59:38,078
# Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah...

893
00:59:38,161 --> 00:59:39,911
# Yeah...

894
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:41,744
I didn't know she could sing.

895
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:45,119
In her words, she majors in dance
because she can already sing.

896
00:59:45,203 --> 00:59:50,578
# On the weekend, on the weekend
On the weekend, on the weekend

897
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:51,744
Kill it, Miles.

898
00:59:52,786 --> 00:59:55,536
# Back again, hit the lights,
let the party begin...

899
00:59:55,619 --> 01:00:00,369
- So, are you gonna ask me to dance?
- Didn't know you can dance without tights.

900
01:00:00,453 --> 01:00:02,953
# And I think
I'm ready to go, hot...

901
01:00:03,036 --> 01:00:05,203
You don't know
what you got yourself into.

902
01:00:05,286 --> 01:00:07,619
# Everyone in line
and they're payin' a lot

903
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:09,703
# Drop a Ben,
them drinks are rich

904
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:13,536
# But the music is free
You want it, you love it

905
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:15,703
# You need it,
you know you gotta have it

906
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:18,411
# The music is playin'...

907
01:00:18,453 --> 01:00:19,786
What is that?

908
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:24,411
# This is for the girls comin' from NYC
I'm feelin' you like you's family

909
01:00:24,453 --> 01:00:27,703
# And everybody down
from L.A. to D.C.

910
01:00:27,786 --> 01:00:29,453
Whoo!

911
01:00:29,536 --> 01:00:31,536
Come on.

912
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:32,953
# Turn the volume up 3db

913
01:00:33,036 --> 01:00:35,494
# Get on the dance floor
where the music is free

914
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:38,161
# Slip on until the dawn's gone with me

915
01:00:38,244 --> 01:00:40,661
# Slip on until the dawn's gone with me

916
01:00:40,744 --> 01:00:42,578
# While the music is free

917
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:46,078
- # Slip on until the dawn's gone with me
- # On the weekend...

918
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:50,286
Now all my ladies,
over to the front.

919
01:00:50,369 --> 01:00:52,494
Show 'em what you got.

920
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:59,911
# Ooh, hoo-ooh

921
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:02,577
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh

922
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:04,577
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh

923
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,911
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, oo-ooh

924
01:01:06,952 --> 01:01:08,577
Fellas...

925
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:10,077
move like that.

926
01:01:12,786 --> 01:01:14,786
# Uh...

927
01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:28,952
# Uh-huh, uh-huh

928
01:01:29,036 --> 01:01:32,036
# Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

929
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:34,411
- # I like that
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh

930
01:01:34,452 --> 01:01:36,869
- # Can all my ladies say
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh

931
01:01:36,952 --> 01:01:38,994
- # All the fellas say
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh

932
01:01:39,077 --> 01:01:41,077
- # Everybody say
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh

933
01:01:41,161 --> 01:01:43,244
- # Come dance with me
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh

934
01:01:43,286 --> 01:01:45,411
# And the story goes just like this

935
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,619
# We pack 'em in till the morning,
there'll be no lettin' off

936
01:01:48,702 --> 01:01:50,702
# Dollars droppin' onto the tabletop

937
01:01:50,786 --> 01:01:53,161
# You can shake your thing
and there ain't no cost

938
01:01:53,244 --> 01:01:57,286
- # This is for the girls comin' from NYC
- # I'm feelin' you like you's family

939
01:01:57,369 --> 01:02:01,786
- # And everybody down from L.A. to D.C.
- # Rockin' to the same old-school beat

940
01:02:01,869 --> 01:02:04,661
# This is for the kids
in the clubs and the street

941
01:02:04,744 --> 01:02:06,036
# Turn the volume up 3db

942
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:09,077
# Get on the dance floor
where the music is free

943
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,036
# Slip on until the dawn's
gone with me

944
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:15,202
- # This is for the girls comin' from NYC
- # I'm feelin' you like you's family

945
01:02:15,286 --> 01:02:19,786
- # And everybody down from L.A. to D.C.
- # Rockin' to the same old-school beat

946
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:22,536
# This is for the kids
in the clubs and the street

947
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:24,161
# Turn the volume up 3db

948
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:26,744
# Get on the dance floor
where the music is free

949
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:29,411
# Slip on until the dawn's gone with me

950
01:02:29,452 --> 01:02:31,827
# Slip on until the dawn's gone with me

951
01:02:31,911 --> 01:02:33,411
# While the music is free

952
01:02:33,494 --> 01:02:35,286
# Slip on until the dawn's gone with me

953
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:37,744
# On the weekend,
on the weekend, yeah

954
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,452
Come here, baby.

955
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:56,244
Oh!

956
01:02:56,286 --> 01:02:59,369
I swear, I have never seen
that many people here before.

957
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:03,077
Get used to it.
That was great.

958
01:03:04,452 --> 01:03:07,577
Come on, you guys.
Let's take a walk by the water.

959
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:10,952
- Come on, let's walk.
- Let them go. Let them go.

960
01:03:18,452 --> 01:03:22,577
- You're gonna make me say it, aren't you?
- Make you say what?

961
01:03:24,036 --> 01:03:27,161
- I know I been hatin' on Colin.
- Mm, yeah.

962
01:03:27,244 --> 01:03:29,411
But...

963
01:03:29,452 --> 01:03:33,119
He was good.
He was real good.

964
01:03:33,202 --> 01:03:35,869
For someone who's so sophisticated.

965
01:03:35,952 --> 01:03:38,494
Why you always gotta play?

966
01:03:40,327 --> 01:03:42,577
You were, um...

967
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:44,619
pretty good yourself.

968
01:03:44,702 --> 01:03:48,452
Miles, a little bit.
Just... Yeah, just a little.

969
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:50,952
I try to do what I do.

970
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:05,702
Um...

971
01:04:06,786 --> 01:04:07,869
Um...

972
01:04:07,952 --> 01:04:10,286
Don't worry about it.

973
01:04:10,327 --> 01:04:12,286
- Lucy...
- I gotta go.

974
01:04:12,327 --> 01:04:15,202
I'm gonna go check our sound levels.

975
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:24,411
That place is crazy.
Is it always like that?

976
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,619
Yes.

977
01:04:26,702 --> 01:04:31,910
But tonight, Miles and Lucy
were on a whole other level.

978
01:04:31,994 --> 01:04:34,327
You weren't so bad yourself.

979
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:37,494
Y'all know exactly what you want.

980
01:04:37,577 --> 01:04:41,160
Well, what about you?
What do you want?

981
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,535
I don't know. Nothin'.

982
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:44,952
Come on.

983
01:04:45,035 --> 01:04:48,577
What about when you were a kid?
All kids want something.

984
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:50,285
I don't know.

985
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:55,952
For me, it's just...
better not to want anything.

986
01:04:56,035 --> 01:05:00,452
That way, if it goes away
or... doesn't happen,

987
01:05:01,827 --> 01:05:04,410
you know,
it just doesn't matter.

988
01:05:05,994 --> 01:05:09,577
But you want something now, right?

989
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:13,577
Like... maybe to go to MSA?

990
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:18,077
There's a lot of things

991
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:20,869
that I want now
that I didn't used to.

992
01:05:20,952 --> 01:05:26,327
I even catch myself every once in a while
actually thinking I can have 'em.

993
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:56,410
Please don't kick me out.
I brought you orange juice.

994
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:59,577
Bill and Lena went out.
You're baby-sitting.

995
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:01,119
Thank you.

996
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:05,910
- Why are you always so tired lately?
- 'Cause I been working a lot.

997
01:06:05,952 --> 01:06:09,744
- Doin' what?
- Why do you ask so many questions?

998
01:06:09,785 --> 01:06:13,619
Never mind. Don't answer that.
Just go get Malcolm's shoes on.

999
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,369
All right.

1000
01:06:15,452 --> 01:06:18,327
Oh, throw it.

1001
01:06:18,994 --> 01:06:20,452
Got it. You almost got it.

1002
01:06:20,535 --> 01:06:23,452
Dancing? You can't dance.

1003
01:06:23,494 --> 01:06:26,410
Who can't dance?
You never seen me dance.

1004
01:06:27,202 --> 01:06:28,910
Then do somethin'.

1005
01:06:28,952 --> 01:06:32,577
Do somethin'?
What you want me to do?

1006
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:35,827
What you want me to do?
Huh? Huh?

1007
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,452
- OK, it was fine. It was OK.
- OK.

1008
01:06:42,327 --> 01:06:44,285
- What was that?
- Throw it.

1009
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:46,452
- Where'd you learn that?
- Nothing.

1010
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:50,827
I'm not throwing anything
until you show me what that was.

1011
01:06:51,952 --> 01:06:55,535
Yeah, all right.
I get you with the little...

1012
01:06:57,452 --> 01:06:58,702
All right.

1013
01:06:58,785 --> 01:07:01,244
You can do that,
you can do this.

1014
01:07:03,994 --> 01:07:05,327
OK.

1015
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:07,619
Hah, hah. What?

1016
01:07:07,702 --> 01:07:10,494
- I love it. All right. So after that...
- Yeah?

1017
01:07:10,577 --> 01:07:12,785
Hit, hit...

1018
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:16,910
OK, let's try it all.

1019
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:18,577
- You got the whole thing?
- Yeah.

1020
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:22,327
OK, all right. On "go".
One, two, three, go, all right?

1021
01:07:23,035 --> 01:07:26,702
One, two, three, go.

1022
01:07:26,785 --> 01:07:27,827
What?

1023
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:28,994
Hit, hit...

1024
01:07:31,744 --> 01:07:32,910
Hey.

1025
01:07:32,994 --> 01:07:36,577
Can you do "running man"?
You don't know about that.

1026
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:40,035
- Malcolm, can you do the "running man"?
- Yeah!

1027
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:42,244
Oh, yeah. What's up?

1028
01:07:42,285 --> 01:07:45,452
- Here we go. He's doing it one-handed.
- Oh, oh.

1029
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:48,452
Whee.

1030
01:07:48,535 --> 01:07:50,285
Whoo!

1031
01:09:13,118 --> 01:09:14,535
This is you?

1032
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:16,868
Don't be mean.
I was a chubby kid.

1033
01:09:19,952 --> 01:09:23,327
What are you saying? If I was
like that now, you wouldn't like me?

1034
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:26,243
No, I could deal
with the chubbiness.

1035
01:09:26,285 --> 01:09:29,868
But if you were missing those front teeth,
I couldn't work with that.

1036
01:09:29,952 --> 01:09:33,243
Thank you very much.

1037
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:38,077
I was thinking we should talk to
Director Gordon about using the showcase

1038
01:09:38,118 --> 01:09:40,743
as your audition to get into the school.

1039
01:09:42,993 --> 01:09:46,202
I don't know.
Do you think she'd go for that?

1040
01:09:46,285 --> 01:09:49,077
It's about going after what you want, right?

1041
01:09:59,785 --> 01:10:02,243
Mom. Um, hey.

1042
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,952
I-I didn't know you were home already.

1043
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:08,118
This is Tyler,
my rehearsal partner.

1044
01:10:08,202 --> 01:10:12,410
Nice to meet you, Ms. Clark.
You have a beautiful home here.

1045
01:10:12,452 --> 01:10:15,827
Thank you.
We certainly like it.

1046
01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:22,410
I should probably get going, anyway.
Thanks for showing me those pictures.

1047
01:10:22,493 --> 01:10:23,868
Yeah.

1048
01:10:23,952 --> 01:10:26,410
It was nice to meet you.

1049
01:10:38,952 --> 01:10:43,368
A'ight, here we go.
Ready? One, two, three, go.

1050
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:45,785
- Hey.
- Hey.

1051
01:10:45,868 --> 01:10:48,077
- What's up?
- Um...

1052
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:52,285
Look, about the other night -
you didn't tell anybody, did you?

1053
01:10:52,368 --> 01:10:54,285
Nah. Uh-uh.

1054
01:10:56,493 --> 01:11:00,577
You know, 'cause it's just
musicians, whatever.

1055
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:03,160
You ain't got nothin' to explain to me.

1056
01:11:03,243 --> 01:11:06,743
What's wrong?
Why you talking to me like that?

1057
01:11:06,785 --> 01:11:10,535
If you wanna be with someone
who doesn't appreciate what he's got,

1058
01:11:10,618 --> 01:11:14,077
that's 100% your business.

1059
01:11:14,452 --> 01:11:19,160
I just thought you'd be smart enough
to know you deserve better.

1060
01:11:21,952 --> 01:11:24,160
Excuse me.

1061
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:34,410
Ready back there? All right.
I wanna hit it hard. All right.

1062
01:11:34,451 --> 01:11:39,701
Smooth it out even more than that.
Just want it to look pretty. All right, go.

1063
01:11:39,785 --> 01:11:41,743
- Wait, hold up.
- Mac?

1064
01:11:41,785 --> 01:11:45,243
Tell me I'm not seeing this, Ty.

1065
01:11:46,118 --> 01:11:48,451
Mac.

1066
01:11:49,576 --> 01:11:52,701
Hold on, Mac.
Yo, wait up a second.

1067
01:11:54,285 --> 01:11:55,910
What you doin', man?

1068
01:11:55,951 --> 01:12:00,285
What is that, Riverdancin'?
You gettin' down with your Irish roots now?

1069
01:12:00,368 --> 01:12:02,285
- It's not like that.
- Like what?

1070
01:12:02,368 --> 01:12:06,993
- It's part of my community service.
- How is dancin' community service?

1071
01:12:08,535 --> 01:12:09,618
It's complicated.

1072
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:12,493
- Explain to me. I ain't that stupid.
- Fine...

1073
01:12:12,576 --> 01:12:15,451
You were s'posed to meet me
at the courts two hours ago.

1074
01:12:15,493 --> 01:12:19,451
I come over here and I see you
blowin' me off for this? This?

1075
01:12:19,493 --> 01:12:24,118
You ain't been hangin' or callin' 'cause you
leapin' around with a bunch of rich kids?

1076
01:12:24,201 --> 01:12:27,701
They're not all rich.
It's not like that.

1077
01:12:27,785 --> 01:12:30,326
All right, Mac, hold on.
There's this girl.

1078
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:34,826
She asked me to rehearse with her
for this showcase thing. That's all.

1079
01:12:41,326 --> 01:12:45,243
So you messin' around
with our friendship for a girl?

1080
01:12:45,285 --> 01:12:48,118
So it's like that?

1081
01:12:49,326 --> 01:12:52,576
- That's a relief, Ty.
- Come on, man.

1082
01:13:17,785 --> 01:13:19,576
That's great.

1083
01:13:19,618 --> 01:13:21,618
- Hey, Tyler.
- Hey.

1084
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,618
What, are you back?

1085
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:27,743
Yeah. Feelin' a lot better.
Thanks for fillin' in for me.

1086
01:13:28,993 --> 01:13:31,285
- Can you give us a sec?
- Sure.

1087
01:13:41,118 --> 01:13:42,076
Hey, guys.

1088
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,785
- Hey. Good?
- Definitely.

1089
01:13:48,785 --> 01:13:52,160
I didn't think he was coming back.
He hasn't even been here.

1090
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:57,076
I don't know what to do.

1091
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,243
So he's back.

1092
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:02,826
Where does that leave me?

1093
01:14:03,535 --> 01:14:08,243
- You don't have to say anything.
- Wait. What does that mean?

1094
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:13,743
I can't believe I bought into this bullshit.
You're really gonna turn your back on me?

1095
01:14:13,785 --> 01:14:18,285
That's not what I'm doing, Tyler.
Andrew is a student here. He's a senior...

1096
01:14:18,368 --> 01:14:21,826
You're just like Brett.
You use people then you dump 'em.

1097
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:26,035
Why are you making it sound like that?
It's not the same situation. You know it.

1098
01:14:26,118 --> 01:14:30,535
So how is it not?!
Have I just been filling in for Andrew?

1099
01:14:30,618 --> 01:14:32,410
That's not fair.

1100
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,618
I'm out.

1101
01:14:36,701 --> 01:14:38,535
Tyler. Tyler, wait.

1102
01:14:38,618 --> 01:14:43,451
Gimme a second to figure this out.

1103
01:14:48,785 --> 01:14:52,493
# Ooh

1104
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:56,993
# Ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh

1105
01:14:58,743 --> 01:15:01,284
# Oh

1106
01:15:01,368 --> 01:15:05,534
# Softly as a child

1107
01:15:05,618 --> 01:15:08,826
# Born in natural rain

1108
01:15:11,284 --> 01:15:14,409
# I predict the seasons

1109
01:15:14,451 --> 01:15:17,284
# To go unchanged

1110
01:15:17,368 --> 01:15:20,243
# Sometimes in life

1111
01:15:21,576 --> 01:15:25,951
# Don't go off runnin'
from what's new

1112
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:30,451
# I became somebody

1113
01:15:30,534 --> 01:15:33,659
# Through lovin' you

1114
01:15:33,743 --> 01:15:37,326
# Warm was the sun

1115
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:43,368
# That covered my body so

1116
01:15:43,451 --> 01:15:46,534
# Reminded me of you...

1117
01:15:46,618 --> 01:15:48,618
Hello.

1118
01:15:48,701 --> 01:15:50,868
Hi. Is Tyler there?

1119
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:52,451
May I ask who's calling?

1120
01:15:52,534 --> 01:15:54,576
It's Nora.

1121
01:15:55,076 --> 01:15:56,993
Nora?

1122
01:15:59,243 --> 01:16:01,909
No, he's not here.

1123
01:16:02,618 --> 01:16:04,784
Yeah, um,
just tell him I called.

1124
01:16:05,201 --> 01:16:06,201
OK.

1125
01:16:06,284 --> 01:16:10,909
# Oh, I became somebody

1126
01:16:10,993 --> 01:16:12,951
# Oh

1127
01:16:13,034 --> 01:16:14,993
# Oh-oh

1128
01:16:15,076 --> 01:16:20,243
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

1129
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:22,909
That's it. Ball, change, up.

1130
01:16:22,951 --> 01:16:25,576
To the left, to the right. Heads up.

1131
01:16:25,618 --> 01:16:28,243
Inside, up.

1132
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:29,993
Easy, knee.

1133
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:34,118
Look up.

1134
01:16:34,201 --> 01:16:36,243
Up, play right.

1135
01:16:38,909 --> 01:16:41,118
All right, thanks.

1136
01:16:41,951 --> 01:16:44,118
Five, six, seven, eight.

1137
01:16:44,201 --> 01:16:46,284
One and two, three, four. Up.

1138
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:47,826
Aah.

1139
01:16:47,909 --> 01:16:51,118
- Andrew, are you all right?
- I don't know.

1140
01:16:51,201 --> 01:16:52,576
Oh.

1141
01:16:52,618 --> 01:16:54,743
OK, try walking on it.

1142
01:16:57,951 --> 01:17:00,993
- I can't do this, Nora.
- What?

1143
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:04,243
You and I both know
I can't pull this routine off.

1144
01:17:14,951 --> 01:17:17,534
Here, Mom.

1145
01:17:17,618 --> 01:17:19,576
Nora...

1146
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:27,034
- Bet you can't make the shot.
- Bet you I can.

1147
01:17:27,118 --> 01:17:29,284
- Whatever.
- Yeah, right, whatever.

1148
01:17:29,368 --> 01:17:31,576
Let me do it.

1149
01:17:31,659 --> 01:17:33,743
You suck, man.

1150
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:38,451
Hey, yo, Ty.

1151
01:17:39,493 --> 01:17:41,076
- Man, what's up?
- What's up?

1152
01:17:41,118 --> 01:17:44,076
- Where you been, man?
- You know, around.

1153
01:17:45,576 --> 01:17:49,076
Gimme my ball back.
Ain't you gonna be late for ballerina class?

1154
01:17:49,118 --> 01:17:51,909
No, man.
I'm through with that.

1155
01:17:51,993 --> 01:17:55,826
- So what happened with that girl?
- Nothin'.

1156
01:17:56,284 --> 01:18:01,243
- Nothin'? I'm supposed to believe you?
- Yeah, man, you are.

1157
01:18:02,743 --> 01:18:05,159
I dunno.
Man that turns his back on his boy...

1158
01:18:05,243 --> 01:18:07,701
Deserves a second chance.

1159
01:18:08,118 --> 01:18:10,409
Right?

1160
01:18:10,451 --> 01:18:12,243
Come on, Mac.

1161
01:18:15,868 --> 01:18:18,034
Party tomorrow night at Omar's, man.

1162
01:18:18,118 --> 01:18:19,534
Ha-ha-ha.

1163
01:18:19,618 --> 01:18:21,951
That's my man.

1164
01:18:21,993 --> 01:18:23,243
Uh-oh.

1165
01:18:23,326 --> 01:18:25,034
And boogie...

1166
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:28,326
Got it, got it, got it.

1167
01:18:29,951 --> 01:18:32,284
Come on, man.

1168
01:18:38,326 --> 01:18:40,451
Mom?

1169
01:18:40,534 --> 01:18:42,242
Are you OK?

1170
01:18:42,326 --> 01:18:47,284
Do you know even when you were a baby
you danced better than you could walk?

1171
01:18:47,367 --> 01:18:50,201
It was all you ever wanted to do.

1172
01:18:50,284 --> 01:18:56,159
I remember the look on your face the day
we took you to your first dance class.

1173
01:18:56,242 --> 01:18:58,242
You do?

1174
01:19:03,034 --> 01:19:08,742
I never expected that dancing would still
bring you such joy after all these years.

1175
01:19:09,992 --> 01:19:15,742
Seeing you up there on the stage
so happy - it used to make me happy.

1176
01:19:17,826 --> 01:19:21,451
- I guess I forgot about that.
- Mom, it's OK.

1177
01:19:21,534 --> 01:19:27,617
I am so excited
to see you dance in your showcase.

1178
01:19:27,701 --> 01:19:29,617
Oh. Mom...

1179
01:19:29,659 --> 01:19:31,951
I don't even have a partner anymore.

1180
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:34,867
Tyler's not doing it and Andrew's out.

1181
01:19:34,951 --> 01:19:36,659
Baby...

1182
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:40,492
You can do this.

1183
01:19:40,576 --> 01:19:43,867
You've been doing this
by yourself your whole life.

1184
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:45,409
Come here.

1185
01:19:46,576 --> 01:19:49,534
You are gonna be great.

1186
01:19:49,617 --> 01:19:51,742
Thanks, Mom.

1187
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:58,451
- I'm still gonna win.
- We'll see.

1188
01:20:00,117 --> 01:20:01,576
That's why I'm beating you.

1189
01:20:01,659 --> 01:20:04,242
Yeah, a'ight, whatever.
I'm gonna come back.

1190
01:20:04,326 --> 01:20:08,284
- What y'all up to tonight?
- We goin' to Omar's to watch movies.

1191
01:20:08,367 --> 01:20:09,576
Yeah.

1192
01:20:09,659 --> 01:20:14,242
I know all about your movies.
You stayin' here, you understand?

1193
01:20:14,284 --> 01:20:16,867
What?! Ma... I got to go last time.

1194
01:20:16,951 --> 01:20:20,326
Yeah, I know, and that's why
you staying here tonight.

1195
01:20:20,951 --> 01:20:23,284
You boys make sure
my baby don't go nowhere.

1196
01:20:23,367 --> 01:20:24,951
- All right, Ma.
- Yes, ma'am.

1197
01:20:26,951 --> 01:20:29,784
- I'll tuck you in before we leave.
- Shut up.

1198
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:31,409
# Let's go!

1199
01:20:34,034 --> 01:20:37,076
All these girls and he don't wanna dance.

1200
01:20:40,867 --> 01:20:42,492
Huh? Huh?

1201
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:49,742
Yo, yo, here's the man.

1202
01:20:50,451 --> 01:20:52,576
What's up, T?

1203
01:20:52,617 --> 01:20:54,242
- What's goin' on, man?
- Nada.

1204
01:20:54,284 --> 01:20:56,784
I'm good. So this
your man's spot right here?

1205
01:20:56,826 --> 01:20:58,159
Yeah, man.

1206
01:20:58,242 --> 01:20:59,534
It's tight.

1207
01:20:59,617 --> 01:21:00,867
Yeah, right.

1208
01:21:00,951 --> 01:21:03,242
So, I don't know,
what's been goin' on?

1209
01:21:03,742 --> 01:21:06,576
Everything cool.
Nora's good.

1210
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:07,742
Yeah?

1211
01:21:07,784 --> 01:21:10,534
- Andrew quit, though.
- What you mean, he quit?

1212
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:13,576
He got hurt.
He can't dance with her anymore.

1213
01:21:14,992 --> 01:21:17,701
Damn.

1214
01:21:17,784 --> 01:21:20,284
- I don't know. Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.

1215
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:24,784
Why don't you stop the bullshit? I bet you
been mopin' around as much as she has.

1216
01:21:24,867 --> 01:21:28,576
- She been mopin'?
- I ain't sayin' nothin', man.

1217
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:31,117
- Did you see a tear?
- Nah.

1218
01:21:31,617 --> 01:21:32,992
Mopin'.

1219
01:21:33,076 --> 01:21:35,367
Shut up. Let me
introduce you to somebody.

1220
01:21:35,451 --> 01:21:37,576
- All right, my man C.
- What's up?

1221
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:40,409
My boy Mac.
Mac, this is Miles. Miles, Mac.

1222
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:07,659
I started tearin' up like a little girl tellin'
them that I go to the School of the Arts.

1223
01:22:07,742 --> 01:22:10,784
- Wait, hold up. You go to MSA?
- Yeah.

1224
01:22:10,867 --> 01:22:12,784
- That's how you know each other?
- Yeah.

1225
01:22:12,825 --> 01:22:14,784
Yeah, exactly.

1226
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:18,159
You don't look like
no art-school cat to me.

1227
01:22:18,242 --> 01:22:20,909
What's an art-school cat
supposed to look like?

1228
01:22:20,992 --> 01:22:25,742
Miles Davis, Tupac, Mobb Deep -
those cats went to art school.

1229
01:22:26,367 --> 01:22:30,200
- I'm just sayin'...
- You know what? Just shut up.

1230
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:34,909
Yo, what's up, playas?
Yo, yo, yo, what's up? How y'all doin'?

1231
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:39,450
- Skinny, what are you doin' here?
- The same thing you doin' here.

1232
01:22:39,492 --> 01:22:42,575
- Let's go. Out the door. No.
- What are you talkin' about?

1233
01:22:42,617 --> 01:22:44,700
Hey, move, man, move.

1234
01:22:44,784 --> 01:22:47,409
Let me be here, man.
What's wrong with you?

1235
01:22:47,492 --> 01:22:49,784
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on, man.

1236
01:22:49,867 --> 01:22:53,909
Here. Matter of fact, here.
Here's some bus money. Go home.

1237
01:22:53,992 --> 01:22:56,950
Why I gotta leave?
What you talkin' about?

1238
01:22:56,992 --> 01:22:59,867
- Your mom'll kill us if she finds you here.
- Go home.

1239
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:02,450
Man, let me in.

1240
01:23:03,367 --> 01:23:04,575
Shh...

1241
01:23:04,617 --> 01:23:07,117
Man, I'm lookin' all sexy for no reason.

1242
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,284
What y'all laughin' at, man?

1243
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:13,284
- What up, Skinny?
- Don't touch me.

1244
01:23:14,284 --> 01:23:17,617
- I'll be back. Watch the car.
- Be right here, PJ.

1245
01:23:26,659 --> 01:23:29,242
Kick me out the party.

1246
01:23:38,659 --> 01:23:41,075
Hey, yo, get me a 40.

1247
01:23:41,117 --> 01:23:44,242
- What you got in the bag?
- My music, you know.

1248
01:23:45,992 --> 01:23:47,825
Do somethin', then.

1249
01:23:47,909 --> 01:23:50,284
- You want me to show 'em somethin'?
- Put it down.

1250
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:53,284
It's nothin', it's nothin'.

1251
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:57,575
- DJ, can I get up on your table real quick?
- Yeah, you cool.

1252
01:23:57,617 --> 01:23:58,659
Watch this.

1253
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:15,742
You're supposed to be
watching the car.

1254
01:24:21,284 --> 01:24:22,909
Told you to watch the car, man.

1255
01:24:25,117 --> 01:24:27,034
Come get me.

1256
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:34,909
# Take the swing, here's your chance
You got nothin' to lose, make your stand

1257
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:37,450
# The clock is tickin'
and time ain't waitin'

1258
01:24:37,534 --> 01:24:40,284
# When ya all alone,
that's what you're facin'...

1259
01:25:09,742 --> 01:25:11,909
- You see what your brother's doing?
- Who?

1260
01:25:11,992 --> 01:25:13,950
Your little brother, man. Come on.

1261
01:25:14,034 --> 01:25:16,784
That boy don't listen, man.

1262
01:25:20,117 --> 01:25:21,617
What's he doin'?

1263
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,409
Yo, Mac, Ty,
bring some girls out here.

1264
01:25:24,492 --> 01:25:25,700
That's PJ's truck.

1265
01:25:25,784 --> 01:25:29,283
- Skinny, get out of that truck.
- Man, why?

1266
01:25:29,367 --> 01:25:31,700
- I said get out.
- Let's go get him.

1267
01:25:32,367 --> 01:25:33,533
Man...

1268
01:25:43,283 --> 01:25:44,283
Skinny.

1269
01:25:50,283 --> 01:25:52,700
Oh, no, no, no, man.

1270
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:55,408
Yo, Skinny, Skinny.

1271
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:58,533
Say something, say something.
Talk. Talk to me.

1272
01:25:58,617 --> 01:26:00,575
Yo, call somebody, man!
Do somethin'.

1273
01:26:00,617 --> 01:26:02,700
Call 911!

1274
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:05,450
Get up, get up.
Get up, man, get up!

1275
01:27:31,867 --> 01:27:33,242
Hey.

1276
01:27:34,117 --> 01:27:36,117
Hey.

1277
01:27:39,075 --> 01:27:41,742
How long you been out here?

1278
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:44,242
I don't know.

1279
01:27:46,492 --> 01:27:47,783
How's your mom?

1280
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:53,575
She spoke to me
for the first time today.

1281
01:27:58,617 --> 01:28:03,325
- You know they got PJ, right?
- That's not gonna bring Skinny back.

1282
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:10,867
- This ain't your fault.
- That don't bring him back either.

1283
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:13,158
I hate seeing you beat yourself up.

1284
01:28:13,242 --> 01:28:18,283
I'm beating myself up? We been
beating ourselves up way before Skinny...

1285
01:28:24,783 --> 01:28:27,117
Skinny's dead.

1286
01:28:27,158 --> 01:28:29,033
He's gone.

1287
01:28:29,117 --> 01:28:31,408
My little brother's gone.

1288
01:28:32,658 --> 01:28:34,617
And that's on me, Ty.

1289
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,408
I know that.

1290
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:39,408
I ain't stupid.

1291
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:42,867
All the partying,
stealing cars, messin' around.

1292
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:45,075
You don't think I know
it's a bunch of bull?

1293
01:28:45,117 --> 01:28:48,200
- We're doing the best we can.
- You really believe that?

1294
01:28:48,283 --> 01:28:51,117
You really think this is the best we can be?

1295
01:28:52,783 --> 01:28:54,075
No.

1296
01:28:55,867 --> 01:28:57,991
I wanna be better.

1297
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:00,241
I wanna do better.

1298
01:29:03,783 --> 01:29:05,533
You're right.

1299
01:29:05,616 --> 01:29:10,241
We gotta do it for my moms, for Skinny.

1300
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:18,158
For Skinny.

1301
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,283
Can you do me a favor?

1302
01:29:38,366 --> 01:29:40,283
Yeah.

1303
01:29:40,325 --> 01:29:43,200
Will you come somewhere with me?

1304
01:29:50,283 --> 01:29:52,241
Have a good show tonight.

1305
01:29:54,116 --> 01:29:56,741
Hey, Miles. Hey.

1306
01:29:56,825 --> 01:29:58,408
What's up?

1307
01:29:58,491 --> 01:30:01,741
- Have you heard from Tyler at all?
- Nah, nah.

1308
01:30:01,825 --> 01:30:03,575
How's Nora?

1309
01:30:03,616 --> 01:30:06,908
- She's good.
- That's cool.

1310
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:08,450
That's cool.

1311
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:17,616
- What was that all about?
- Thanks, I guess, for...

1312
01:30:17,658 --> 01:30:19,575
Hey, guys.

1313
01:30:19,616 --> 01:30:20,741
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

1314
01:30:20,825 --> 01:30:23,408
- Miles, you ready?
- Oh, yeah, you know it.

1315
01:30:23,491 --> 01:30:25,616
Great. See ya there.

1316
01:30:29,491 --> 01:30:32,908
Luce, have a good show tonight.

1317
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:34,491
You too.

1318
01:30:56,616 --> 01:31:00,616
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to this very special evening.

1319
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:04,908
The senior showcase is a highlight of our
year at the Maryland School of the Arts.

1320
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,741
Ten minutes, everyone.

1321
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:13,033
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1322
01:31:13,116 --> 01:31:15,158
Gimme some. Come on.

1323
01:31:22,575 --> 01:31:25,075
- Hey, yo, thanks, man.
- Will you go?

1324
01:31:47,408 --> 01:31:48,408
Nora.

1325
01:31:48,491 --> 01:31:51,450
- What are you doing here?
- Before you say anything...

1326
01:31:51,533 --> 01:31:52,741
Shh!

1327
01:31:52,783 --> 01:31:55,950
I don't know where to start. I just...

1328
01:31:56,033 --> 01:31:59,366
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
walked out on you like that.

1329
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:02,575
- Tyler, this is not the time.
- Please let me get this out.

1330
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:07,283
I've made every wrong decision
I could possibly have made.

1331
01:32:07,366 --> 01:32:09,491
I'm doing this without a partner.

1332
01:32:09,575 --> 01:32:12,866
That's enough.
Nora, check your dancers.

1333
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:16,741
Tyler, I don't think
you realize how important this is.

1334
01:32:16,825 --> 01:32:20,408
I do realize how important this is.
That's exactly why I'm here.

1335
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:23,616
You said if I want something,
I gotta fight for it. Right?

1336
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:27,908
That's what I'm doing. I'm fighting for
something real for the first time in my life.

1337
01:32:27,949 --> 01:32:31,574
I can't do this right now.
This is everything I've worked for.

1338
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:36,241
I know and I'm sorry. I wanted you
to do this the way you imagined it.

1339
01:32:37,908 --> 01:32:39,158
That's it.

1340
01:32:41,283 --> 01:32:43,491
I can't.

1341
01:32:43,574 --> 01:32:44,991
It's too late.

1342
01:32:49,699 --> 01:32:52,408
OK.

1343
01:32:52,449 --> 01:32:53,783
Um...

1344
01:32:53,866 --> 01:32:55,908
Good luck.

1345
01:33:01,699 --> 01:33:04,324
Tyler.

1346
01:33:09,616 --> 01:33:11,741
Do you remember the steps?

1347
01:33:11,783 --> 01:33:15,408
Couldn't forget 'em
even if I wanted to.

1348
01:33:17,949 --> 01:33:21,741
OK, everyone, we're back
to the old dance with Tyler.

1349
01:33:21,783 --> 01:33:25,033
Yeah!

1350
01:33:25,116 --> 01:33:27,491
OK, let's go.

1351
01:33:29,574 --> 01:33:31,908
This is the girl
I was telling you about.

1352
01:33:31,949 --> 01:33:33,949
OK.

1353
01:33:39,408 --> 01:33:41,158
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1354
01:34:18,574 --> 01:34:19,533
# Ah

1355
01:34:19,616 --> 01:34:21,616
# I see you, give it to me

1356
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:24,116
# Stop playin', ah

1357
01:34:24,199 --> 01:34:26,449
# I see you, give it to me

1358
01:34:26,533 --> 01:34:27,949
# Stop playin'

1359
01:35:47,616 --> 01:35:50,408
# Let's get it goin', unh

1360
01:35:51,824 --> 01:35:53,491
# Whoo, yeah

1361
01:35:53,574 --> 01:35:55,241
# Let's get it goin' now

1362
01:35:55,324 --> 01:35:56,532
# Unh

1363
01:35:56,616 --> 01:35:58,241
# Yeah, unh

1364
01:35:58,324 --> 01:35:59,991
# A little louder now

1365
01:36:00,074 --> 01:36:03,199
# Come on, yeah, unh

1366
01:36:03,282 --> 01:36:04,907
# Let's get it poppin' now

1367
01:36:04,991 --> 01:36:07,324
# Yeah, come on

1368
01:36:07,407 --> 01:36:08,616
# Unh, unh

1369
01:36:08,699 --> 01:36:09,741
# Let's go

1370
01:36:09,824 --> 01:36:12,074
# I see you, give it to me

1371
01:36:12,116 --> 01:36:14,782
# Stop playin', ah

1372
01:36:14,866 --> 01:36:16,574
# I see you, give it to me

1373
01:36:16,657 --> 01:36:19,616
# Stop playin', ah

1374
01:36:19,657 --> 01:36:21,616
# I see you, give it to me

1375
01:36:21,699 --> 01:36:24,407
# Stop playin', ah

1376
01:36:24,449 --> 01:36:26,532
# I see you, give it to me

1377
01:36:26,616 --> 01:36:29,157
# Stop playin', ah

1378
01:36:29,241 --> 01:36:31,532
# I see you, give it to me

1379
01:36:31,616 --> 01:36:33,407
# Stop playin', ah

1380
01:36:33,491 --> 01:36:36,074
# I see you, give it to me

1381
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:38,032
# Stop playin', ah

1382

Bravo!

1388
01:37:07,366 --> 01:37:09,407
You were so good.

1389
01:37:12,949 --> 01:37:14,616
That's right.

1390
01:37:35,282 --> 01:37:38,157
Hey, that was good stuff
out there. Worked it.

1391
01:37:38,241 --> 01:37:40,241
That was all pretty good.

1392
01:37:40,324 --> 01:37:41,699
You seen me dance before.

1393
01:37:41,782 --> 01:37:45,282
But not like that. I ain't
never seen you do nothing like that.

1394
01:37:45,366 --> 01:37:47,907
- That was her right there.
- That's her?

1395
01:37:47,991 --> 01:37:50,866
And over here,
this is Nora Clark.

1396
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:54,366
- Wow, you were wonderful.
- Thank you so much.

1397
01:37:54,449 --> 01:37:59,741
I'd like to discuss with you the possibility
of joining our company after graduation.

1398
01:37:59,782 --> 01:38:01,699
- I would love that.
- Yeah, me too.

1399
01:38:01,782 --> 01:38:04,241
She's everything you said she'd be.

1400
01:38:04,324 --> 01:38:07,782
Who's the male lead?

1401
01:38:07,824 --> 01:38:10,782
This is Tyler Gage.

1402
01:38:10,824 --> 01:38:13,074
He's a transfer.

1403
01:38:13,157 --> 01:38:14,282
Oh, my God.

1404
01:38:14,366 --> 01:38:15,366
Wait, a what?

1405
01:38:15,449 --> 01:38:18,616
- Don't forget to send me your transcripts.
- Yes, ma'am.

1406
01:38:18,699 --> 01:38:21,116
- Very well done.
- We'll see you Monday.

1407
01:38:23,282 --> 01:38:25,491
We'll see you on Monday.

1408
01:38:25,574 --> 01:38:27,449
- Congrats, man.
- Appreciate it.

1409
01:38:27,532 --> 01:38:30,241
Let you do your thing.
I'll meet you at the car.

1410
01:38:31,949 --> 01:38:35,824
- You know what that means, right?
- No. What's that mean?

1411
01:38:35,907 --> 01:38:39,574
- You're gonna have to get some tights.
- Done.
