00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,705
<i>Deep in the Wuyi Mountains,
there laid a mysterious well</i>

3
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,369
<i>which contained a powerful form of
chi known as the Golden Nectar.</i>

4
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,744
<i>Lord Pi,
a renegade monk, learned</i>

5
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,751
<i>whoever controlled the Golden
Nectar could gain immortality.</i>

6
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,818
<i>So he pursued the prize
with a savage onslaught.</i>

7
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,195
<i>The monks, who had protected the
source of chi for centuries,</i>

8
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,161
<i>were not strong enough.</i>

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,029
<i>But the Abbott,
a man of peace,
was prepared for war.</i>

10
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,233
<i>The Gemini Killers.</i>

11
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,740
<i>They delivered both
the element of surprise</i>

12
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,573
<i>And the extreme force needed
to vanquish this dark enemy.</i>

13
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:16,044
<i>Lord Pi had finally
overplayed his cosmic hand.</i>

14
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,520
<i>That was 10 years ago.</i>

15
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,222
<i>Now, legend has it
that the ghost of Lord Pi</i>

16
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,127
<i>still haunts these
remote mountains,</i>

17
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,699
<i>stealing chi from any
source he could find.</i>

18
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,606
<i>They say Lord Buddha
laughs at the world,</i>

19
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,612
<i>and I'm sure
he's laughing down at me.</i>

20
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:46,378
<i>After leaving Jungle Village,
I decided to return
back to the monks.</i>

21
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,822
<i>My challenge would
be to find peace,</i>

22
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,328
<i>reawaken my chi</i>

23
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,294
<i>and atone for my sins.</i>

24
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,728
<i>Maybe this Golden Nectar
at the Wuyi mountain</i>

25
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,136
<i>could help build
me a new future.</i>

26
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,935
<i>Lord knows I need it.</i>

27
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:16,506
<i>But even though you may try
to leave your past behind,</i>

28
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:17,673
<i>in the end,</i>

29
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,613
<i>it always finds you.</i>

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,353
Whoever you are,
I don't have no
quarrel with you.

31
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,155
Oh, but you do.

32
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,556
You murdered my brother,
Silver Lion.

33
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,120
I should have recognized
the stupid hairstyle.

34
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,185
Kill him.

35
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,653
Look.

36
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,495
Look what he has
done to my daughter.

37
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,305
What has this evil
spirit done to my angel?

38
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:39,680
How many more will the ghost of
Lord Pi take before we stop him?

39
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,545
You...

40
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,951
You are the mayor
of this town!

41
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,890
It's your responsibility
to protect our children!

42
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,053
Master Ho! You didn't
protect her either.

43
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,661
Such a pretty little thing.

44
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,792
What a waste.

45
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,705
Your grieving time's over.

46
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,341
Get back to my mine before
my silver turns to dust.

47
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,211
Okay, everybody.
Let's carry on.

48
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,221
If we want Master Ho's
full cooperation

49
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,155
in catching this
perverted demon,

50
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,387
we must show him
our dedication.

51
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,825
I hear you all think the
tools I provide are inadequate.

52
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:40,335
You bastard maggots
of whoring mongrel dogs.

53
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,303
Do you think this
is fit for the job?

54
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,569
Do you think
this is a good tool?

55
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,407
Well, let's see!
No!

56
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:57,419
Who here thinks this
is not a good tool?

57
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,957
A bad craftsman
blames his tools.

58
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,265
All of you miners are
under contract to me!

59
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,929
When you are in this mine,
you belong to me.

60
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,466
If you're not convinced,

61
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,211
I'll have the heads
of the five

62
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,338
slowest miners today.

63
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,147
Hey! Back to work!
Back to work, now!

64
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:46,893
Stay back.

65
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,631
What are you all
standing here for, huh?

66
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,197
Get back to work!

67
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,400
All of you!
Back to work.

68
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,307
Will you trust me?
This is not the time.

69
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,301
You.

70
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,311
Outside with me.

71
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,174
Now!

72
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,313
Go!

73
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,255
The Beetle Clan
are killing our men!

74
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,866
We must stand up for ourselves.

75
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,203
<i>We may not have the right
weapons, but we are ready.</i>

76
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,339
I ask you, Li Kung,

77
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,567
when do we take
the fight to these bastards?

78
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,406
We must remain composed

79
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,538
and only make our move
when everything is in place.

80
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,181
Patience is
the key to victory.

81
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,516
You've been preaching
patience for many months now.

82
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,112
Where has that gotten us?

83
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,020
Are you questioning
my leadership?

84
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,094
Come on, let's go.
It's getting late.

85
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,630
So, who among
you has a complaint tonight?

86
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,635
Step forward and
challenge your opponent.

87
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,238
From the shadows
you attack me?

88
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,146
Master Ho will
challenge any of you

89
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,813
to step in the ring
and fight me with honor.

90
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,024
I'll take all of you on.

91
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,257
Who among you wants
to take on Master Ho?

92
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,276
Fools.

93
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,774
Show me your face.

94
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,112
I came here for you,
Master Ho.

95
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,282
Let me tell you
how this will end.

96
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,991
I've been hanged once.

97
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,457
I've been bullwhipped twice.

98
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:32,501
I've been shot at eight times.

99
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,974
I've been dragged
behind horses 15 times.

100
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,570
An overzealous whore in Manchukuo
chewed off my left testicle

101
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,672
before I cut off her head

102
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,717
and had my way with her.

103
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,519
It takes more than
bad intent to kill me.

104
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,584
The stars must align.

105
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,698
The birds must swim.

106
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,596
The fish must fly,

107
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,170
before I will die.

108
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,602
You see, gentlemen,

109
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:18,205
you just walked
into a windstorm

110
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,217
of flying elephant shit.

111
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,185
Attack!

112
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,858
No!

113
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,398
Stop it!

114
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,705
No!

115
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,756
You feeling brave today, Kung?

116
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,584
You keep your
gaze on your boots

117
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,423
or you'll end up
like my friend here.

118
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,289
Keep on walking.

119
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,494
Someday, I'll shove
my shovel down his gullet.

120
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,628
You keep your nose
on the grindstone, brother.

121
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,503
He's itching
for a fight today.

122
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,854
A girl is dead!

123
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,156
They found another
girl near the village!

124
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,163
A girl is dead!

125
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,371
What's going on in here?

126
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,634
Get back to work!

127
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,541
Unless you want to
join your dead friend!

128
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,476
The ghost of Lord Pi
has killed another girl.

129
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,912
Why can't you stop him?

130
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:35,042
I'll kick your teeth in
if I hadn't done it already!

131
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,382
A girl is dead
and you threaten us?

132
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,753
You dare talking
back to me, my monkeys?

133
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,416
Li Guang! Li Guang!

134
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:45,087
Never, ever
lay hands on me again.

135
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:53,327
Get back to work.
All of you.

136
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:00,502
Duyan will resolve
this issue with you later.

137
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,739
You know how.

138
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,180
You all know
the rules and the law.

139
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,189
I hate this hole.

140
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,362
Almost as much as you.

141
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,929
Work!

142
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,876
I don't need
you defending me.

143
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,142
Next time, just mind
your own business.

144
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:42,242
Li Guang,
you are my younger brother.

145
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,083
But your temper often

146
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,486
gets the best of you.

147
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,916
While you stood there
and did nothing for us!

148
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,097
Master Ho, I need to talk to
you about the murdered girls.

149
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,868
Can you do nothing?

150
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:43,604
If you have a grievance,
take it up with the mayor.

151
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,650
Master Ho, you must
protect this village!

152
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,980
Kung!

153
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,716
Look who saved your day.

154
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,954
Get this pathetic, ignorant
insect out of my sight.

155
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,983
Come.

156
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,180
We will all come together.

157
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,582
The villagers
want justice.

158
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,159
Not just for
the murdered girls,

159
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,717
but they're killing
miners as well.

160
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,318
Two more yesterday.

161
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,887
I will appeal to Master Ho.

162
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,397
Words are not enough, Mayor.

163
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,899
Yes, I understand.

164
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,825
I'll take care
of it, trust me.

165
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,739
Kung, rumor has it
that your brother

166
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,037
is going to challenge Duyan

167
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,203
at the fight court tonight.

168
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,042
I'm concerned for his safety.

169
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,880
Li Guang can take
care of himself.

170
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,753
Duyan is not a small man.

171
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,120
If he crushes him,
and I suspect he will,

172
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,693
what will be
the miner response?

173
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,888
These are the Honor
Fights, Mayor.

174
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:09,365
So whatever the outcome,
our people will accept it.

175
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,365
If you get Li Guang
to apologize,

176
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,961
to sacrifice a week's wages...

177
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,473
My brother is a very,
very proud man.

178
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,270
He would never apologize.

179
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,747
So be it.

180
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,312
I understand your fear.

181
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,318
But Mayor Zhang
has promised me

182
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,082
that Master Ho
and his Beetle Clan

183
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,681
is doing everything they
can to find the murderer.

184
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,426
But what if it is
the ghost of Lord Pi?

185
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,363
How will they protect us?

186
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,697
How will you protect us?

187
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,432
Enough with this
superstitious nonsense.

188
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,212
Well, maybe it is Ho himself?
Ever think of that?

189
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,943
We all know of his insatiable
lust for the young flesh.

190
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,884
Innocence.

191
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,688
I will get to the bottom
of this, I promise you.

192
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:48,888
Right.

193
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,373
Where are you going?

194
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,035
To the tavern.

195
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,010
You're going to the duel.

196
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,878
Everyone is talking about it.

197
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,047
Please don't have him fight.

198
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,177
He has made up
his mind, Ah Ni.

199
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,415
It will kill him
if he doesn't fight.

200
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,358
Well, at least someone in this
family is willing to take a stand.

201
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:18,655
Innocence!

202
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,095
I will be back
before midnight.

203
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,356
Evil spirits, go away.

204
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,061
<i>My name is Li Guang.</i>

205
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,695
I represent my venerable
home village of Tsai Fu.

206
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:00,898
Today, one of your guards
displayed unwarranted cruelty

207
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,405
toward my fellow worker

208
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,138
and must be taught humility.

209
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,642
Yes.

210
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,915
But your actions insulted
the entire Beetle Clan!

211
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:25,790
Therefore, you must face Shou.

212
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:09,131
Fighters, prepare to battle.

213
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,118
Come on, Li Guang!

214
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,657
Come on, Li Guang!
Get in there!

215
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,545
Come on, now. Come on.

216
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:49,635
Yeah!

217
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:02,921
Come on, Li Guang! Come on!

218
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,150
Watch out.

219
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,596
Come on, Li Guang!

220
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,588
That's right! You did it!

221
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,439
Cheers.
Cheers.

222
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,142
Yeah.
Yeah.

223
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,742
It was a thing of beauty.

224
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:41,183
I can't remember
the last time that a miner

225
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,918
saw such a victory!

226
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,484
It won't be the last!

227
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,324
It's time we stood
up to these bullies!

228
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,364
Stand up! Yes! Yes!

229
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,455
Yeah.

230
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:50,923
Right, Kung?

231
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,168
You got it, two more.

232
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,671
All right, everyone.
Enough for one night.

233
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,832
Time to go home to your wives.

234
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:03,311
Kung.
Leave it to you, Li Kung,
to spoil all the fun.

235
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,370
Let's go.

236
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,541
We got work in the morning.

237
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,378
Same old Kung.

238
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,017
That's...

239
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,614
What else could?

240
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,057
Next time.

241
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,621
All right, take a drink.

242
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,360
Let's get out of this place.

243
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:28,299
Congratulations, brother.
You deserved to win.

244
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:32,632
But watch your back. They're
gonna be looking for payback.

245
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,311
We can take on these thugs.
You and me.

246
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,474
Li Guang.

247
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,989
You can't forget
your past forever, Kung.

248
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,226
You're drunk.

249
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,322
Go home.

250
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,700
Sleep it off.

251
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,031
Li Guang. Li Guang.

252
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,660
Are you okay?
Hang on, okay?

253
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,760
Wait! Wait!
I'll get someone.

254
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,636
Come help me.
Come on.

255
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,410
Good morning, Bing.

256
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,640
Ah, beetles.

257
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,186
Hey.
My favorite.

258
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,119
Your favorite?

259
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,419
It was my favorite
when I was young, too.

260
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,618
Really?

261
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,627
Yes. Long time ago.

262
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:38,000
But you must remember
something more important.

263
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,501
What?
Chi.

264
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:43,596
Chi is an energy
that encompasses us all.

265
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,869
And can I ever see it?

266
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,602
Well, no,

267
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:52,012
but that's what makes the
power of believing so strong.

268
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,617
What's going on?

269
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,392
What is it?

270
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,857
Come here.

271
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,730
Look what we
found in the river.

272
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,573
<i>No, no, no.</i>

273
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,370
The answer is no.

274
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:23,139
He could be a criminal,
he could be a killer, or worse.

275
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,306
He has to go.

276
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,077
But, Father,
he's in no condition.

277
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,482
If we move him,
he could die.

278
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,884
Well, you should
have thought about it

279
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:32,421
before you brought
him into my home.

280
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,423
But, Father, look.

281
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,687
Could it be him?

282
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,087
Maybe.

283
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,928
But with those battle wounds,
he is likely in trouble.

284
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,002
And more trouble,
I don't need.

285
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,864
What, you're taking
her side, too?

286
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,341
I haven't spoken a word.

287
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,344
Well, you don't have to.

288
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:59,047
Pity the man who lives
in a house full of women.

289
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,520
All right. But first
sign of trouble, he's gone.
You understand?

290
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,851
Come up.

291
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,290
The entire Beetle Clan
was humiliated

292
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,664
by your pathetic
performance last night.

293
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,997
You will need to
learn how to get

294
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,299
these cockroaches
on their knees.

295
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,169
Ah.

296
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,339
Daddy Ho's home.

297
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:46,783
Come, let me smell your
rosebud and pluck your petal.

298
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,627
Anyone see Li Guang today?

299
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:58,967
No. But we could sure use
his strong back right now.

300
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,633
Kung!

301
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:12,910
What is that?

302
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,210
What in hell's name?

303
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,580
Come on. Let me see.

304
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,210
Take a look.

305
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,221
What do you see?

306
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,159
It's a parallel corridor.

307
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,698
Beautiful.

308
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,185
Kung!

309
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,764
This vein is rich in silver!

310
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,033
Look at this!

311
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,655
Then we have to
come back and explore it.

312
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:16,770
For now, we keep all this
to ourselves, all right?

313
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,028
Let's get back
and plug it up.

314
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:19,977
Come on.

315
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,383
We're coming back.
Make some room.

316
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:28,289
This is between
us, got it?

317
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,654
Like a secret!

318
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,728
Okay. Plug it up
before someone sees it.

319
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,160
Yes, boss.

320
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,795
<i>No! No!</i>

321
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,901
<i>There she is.
You can't run from us, girl.</i>

322
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,410
<i>Come out, come out,
wherever you are.</i>

323
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,118
It's all right.

324
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,587
You're safe here.

325
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,459
Here.

326
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,800
Easy.

327
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,109
Where am I?

328
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,615
Jiangxi province.
Outskirts of Tsai Fu.

329
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,512
Near the Wu Chi temple.

330
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,647
Not many know
of this place.

331
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,450
Does anyone else
know that I'm here?

332
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,689
We took great care to
preserve your privacy.

333
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,860
Are you in some
kind of trouble?

334
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:44,460
Perhaps.

335
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,699
We know who you are.

336
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,305
Your legend
precedes you,
Blacksmith.

337
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,041
They call you the
"Man With the Iron Fists."

338
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,576
Meet my only daughter,
Innocence.

339
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,643
My name is Li Kung.

340
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,152
And that is my wife, Ah Ni.

341
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,322
My name is Thaddeus.

342
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,387
You fight for
the side of good men?

343
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:11,722
What I did in my past,

344
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,092
and what I do in my future
are two different things.

345
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,829
I no longer have
desire to fight.

346
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,562
I'm on a quest
for inner peace.

347
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,934
Well, you came to
the wrong town for that.

348
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:23,836
I have to move you
to a safer place.

349
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,703
Master Ho,
the man who owns the mines,

350
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,176
rules this town.

351
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,507
He is a ruthless man.

352
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,078
And if he knows of
your special gift,

353
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,207
he might have
other designs for you.

354
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,552
Innocence is in
charge of your care.

355
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,522
Although she is young,
but she is a gifted healer.

356
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,026
She and her friend
saved you from the river.

357
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:57,438
I wanna thank you
for saving my life.

358
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,811
I've arranged
for Cha Pow and Bolo

359
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,116
to move Thaddeus
to the old blacksmith shop.

360
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,588
We'll take care
of it, don't worry.

361
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,751
So no one has
seen my brother yet?

362
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,318
Too much celebrating,
I'm sure.

363
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,724
Oh, and be careful.

364
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,766
The walls have eyes
and ears in this town.

365
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,063
In the meantime,
I will look for my brother.

366
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,733
And you be careful.

367
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,638
Who was he?

368
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,138
The last blacksmith.

369
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,444
I guess his
customers wasn't satisfied.

370
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,788
You can rest
here for now.

371
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:23,957
There's water
and some food.

372
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:28,698
Also, Li Kung said he'll
stop by to visit you soon.

373
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:32,132
In the meantime, he wanted
you to take a look at these.

374
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,722
The silver mines.

375
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:58,192
It seems like everyone in
the whole town works there.

376
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,160
Anyone with an able body.

377
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,090
The old men and the women,

378
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:06,192
they help run the village,
lake care of the children.

379
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,496
But those that
try to run away,

380
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,508
they end up hanging on the
stakes at the edge of town.

381
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,405
We may be from
different countries,

382
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:20,381
but we got a lot more in
common than you think, Bolo.

383
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,008
I like to chop the rocks.

384
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,245
I know you do, Cha Pow.

385
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,786
It makes me happy.
Yeah.

386
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,186
But it makes me sad
when the girls die.

387
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,688
What is he
babbling about?

388
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,428
There's been a few
murders recently.

389
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,556
Young women.

390
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,698
Their bodies just shriveled
up like dried fruits.

391
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,074
They say it's evil spirits.

392
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,701
But I know it's
the ghost of Lord Pi.

393
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,940
It's like they're
voided of...

394
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,378
Chi.

395
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:14,895
Yes. Yes.
Play with each other.
Make each other wet.

396
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:17,803
Giggle, laugh, enjoy.

397
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,672
I have three rules
I will tell you now.

398
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:21,903
The first rule,

399
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,010
if you bite me,
I'll rip out your teeth.

400
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:28,141
If you talk to me,
I'll rip out your tongue.

401
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,449
If you look at another man,
I'll rip out your eyes.

402
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:34,750
But aside from this,

403
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,316
I'll give you the finest food
and the finest wine,

404
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,259
and we will have a fine time.

405
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,758
Now, play with each other.

406
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,794
Master Ho.

407
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:48,860
Duyan.

408
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,997
Everything has
been taken care of.

409
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,336
He won't be causing
any more trouble.

410
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,026
This is madness.

411
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,297
No one has ever
been down there before.

412
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,467
Well, Master Ho ordered that we
explore the cave floor below.

413
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,135
He wants to leave
no stone unturned.

414
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,736
Boss, I got a bad
feeling about this.

415
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:34,339
What if a dragon's clown there?
I don't like dragons.

416
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,316
Then I drown him like a rat.

417
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,581
I don't like rats either.

418
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,383
We're supposed
to keep you safe.

419
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,552
Let me go down instead.

420
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,252
I wouldn't ask my men to do
something I wouldn't do myself.

421
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,596
Let's go.
Let's.

422
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,052
Li Guang.

423
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:56,893
Li Guang.

424
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,580
I'm sorry, Li Guang.

425
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,628
Hey, you!
Over there! Back to work!

426
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,601
What's the problem, Kung?

427
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,440
Was your brother
not careful?

428
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:43,278
I made a vow to
always protect my family,

429
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:45,945
including my brother.

430
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,308
Having failed at this,

431
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:53,482
I now have no choice
but to honor his legacy
and demand justice.

432
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,986
Cease!

433
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,629
For you, he's family.

434
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,029
For me,
he's another dead miner.

435
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,628
And if any of you other miners
decide to lose your way,

436
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:11,902
there will be more accidents.

437
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:14,637
Get used to it.

438
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,739
<i>He was a good man.</i>

439
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,720
A proud man.

440
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,387
He won fair and square.

441
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,393
And now he's dead.

442
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,229
That's not right.

443
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,060
It could have
been an accident.

444
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,571
No sign of foul play.

445
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,835
Your words spill out
like dung from a cow, Zhang.

446
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,377
He was my brother!

447
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,680
You tell your boss
I'm not letting this one go.

448
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:59,917
You're in no position
to demand anything, Kung.

449
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:02,082
We must keep
our wits about us.

450
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,451
We don't want to feel the
full force of Ho's wrath...

451
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,963
I have always been
willing to stay in my place

452
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:12,557
and do Ho's bidding,
as long as it
protected my family,

453
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,192
but now?

454
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,701
I know, I know.

455
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,972
It doesn't seem right.

456
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,400
But I have to warn you,

457
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,141
Ho is not happy you've been
stirring rebellion in the mines.

458
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:28,717
Watch your back.

459
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:54,471
<i>So, Mr. Kung, tell me.</i>

460
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,068
<i>These tools?</i>

461
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,149
What's the story?

462
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:03,980
I hope you didn't
find me presumptuous.

463
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:07,750
But I wanted to get your
professional opinion on these.

464
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,619
Well, they're made of the
cheapest pig iron I've ever seen.

465
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,354
And if the goal is
to get as much silver

466
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,090
out of the mines as
quickly as possible,

467
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:17,827
you'll never
reach your quota.

468
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,333
So you understand
my problem.

469
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:22,760
Can you help us?

470
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:25,767
I can fill your
pockets with silver.

471
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,102
That won't be necessary.

472
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,471
I'm in your debt.

473
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:31,605
After all,
you did save my life.

474
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:34,473
That was my daughter's doing.

475
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,319
Me? I would have
thrown you out.

476
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,556
Well, so much for
southern hospitality.

477
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,496
We are desperate people,
Thaddeus.

478
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:57,463
I need to liberate us from
the ruthless Beetle Clan.

479
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,308
And when that fight comes,

480
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,044
my people need a way
to protect themselves.

481
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:05,243
I know you forge
the best weapons.

482
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,674
Will you make them for us?

483
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,543
Mr. Kung,
with all due respect,

484
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:15,650
I've made many devices
that killed many men.

485
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:17,987
Even my hands
have become weapons.

486
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:20,860
I'm on a path to Buddha.

487
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,932
And making weapons
is not on that path.

488
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,835
Doesn't Lord Buddha
protect the weak

489
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,598
and punish evil?

490
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:40,080
I'll fix your tools for you,
then be on my way.

491
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:44,016
How you use them
is up to you.

492
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:44,335
That's very kind of you.

493
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:45,836
It's nothing.

494
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:49,010
My bandages,

495
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,278
did you wrap them?

496
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,353
My father did
the dressing.

497
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,794
Your father seems
like a good man.

498
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,654
He's a very gentle
and kind man.

499
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,323
Sometimes I think too kind.

500
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:12,638
I wish he was more like you.

501
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:19,370
Brave.

502
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,604
Strong.

503
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,982
You shouldn't take
kindness for a weakness.

504
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,214
Sometimes it takes more courage
not to fight than to fight.

505
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,948
My best friend,
Chow-Li, was murdered,

506
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:32,817
and then my uncle.

507
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:36,458
My father did nothing.

508
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:39,128
I'm sure he has his reasons.

509
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,302
Well, someone
has to do something.

510
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,797
We can't just wait
for Master Ho to act.

511
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:05,817
We, Beetle Clan,

512
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:08,930
challenge Li Kung to a duel.

513
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,936
I have no fight
with any of you.

514
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:28,115
So I humbly decline
your challenge.

515
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:33,177
Kung.

516
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,185
You cowardly dog.

517
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:41,060
You vile clown.

518
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,865
Is it that easy for you
to disrespect your village,

519
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,296
your family,

520
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:50,561
forget about your dead,
rotting brother?

521
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,903
You know, the guards
tell me that your daughter

522
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:03,112
is quite the budding rose.

523
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:06,988
I, Li Kung,

524
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:10,222
of Tsai Fu Village,
accept your challenge...

525
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,223
Yes! Yes!

526
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,892
...in honor of
my brother, Li Guang.

527
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:22,828
And don't ever, ever
mention my daughter again.

528
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,301
Kung! Be careful!

529
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:24,129
<i>We can take on
these thugs. You and me.</i>

530
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:28,629
<i>You can't forget
your past forever, Kung.</i>

531
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,264
Yeah!

532
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,942
He did it! We won! Yeah!

533
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,505
Yeah!

534
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:28,218
Cha Pow!

535
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,692
Cha Pow, I need
your muscles inside.

536
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:33,763
Uh, I think I'm supposed
to watch the door.

537
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:38,369
Let him guard the door.

538
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,239
The beauty of iron lies
in its ability to adapt.

539
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:53,449
It offers quick results
and fast change.

540
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,062
You've got a knack
for this, Cha Pow.

541
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,990
Metal is strong, like me.

542
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,510
You are no ordinary miner.

543
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,843
You are much
more than that.

544
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:28,746
Your abilities in the ring
gave you away last night.

545
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,587
You belong to the
Praying Mantis Clan,
don't you?

546
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:35,123
Look, Kung,

547
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,263
I don't like Ho
any more than you do,

548
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:39,590
but I answer to
that monster directly.

549
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:42,433
And you have
a target on your back.

550
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:44,962
Anything else?

551
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,277
Go back to
representing the miners.

552
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:54,939
And let me work on
Ho for concessions.

553
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,777
But be forewarned,

554
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:59,512
don't push Ho.

555
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,188
Ho can make things
difficult for you and me.

556
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:05,192
And your family.

557
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:10,989
You may answer to Ho,
but I don't.

558
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:13,624
Not to you,
not to anyone.

559
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:15,793
Not any longer.

560
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,638
Kung.

561
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,800
I am not the enemy, Kung.

562
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:24,702
Kung!

563
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,242
Boss.

564
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,083
Boss. You must come
to the duel tonight.

565
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:14,747
Too much work to be
done here, Cha Pow.

566
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,089
What's so special
about tonight anyway?

567
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:21,593
Li Kung is going to
challenge Master Ho.

568
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:23,754
Foolish.

569
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,427
Cha Pow.

570
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,162
Yes, boss?

571
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:36,500
A gift. For you.

572
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:39,536
For all your hard work.

573
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:51,315
Cha Pow!

574
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:52,783
Cha Pow, Let's go!

575
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,493
Li Kung is waiting.

576
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,552
Come on.

577
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:56,957
Thank you.

578
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:06,133
What's this? Come here...

579
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:08,298
Boss!

580
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,469
You're bleeding!

581
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:16,899
Let's try to bandage
this up, when we...

582
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:18,244
When we get there.

583
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:03,960
You all know me as Li Kung.

584
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,367
Master Ho,

585
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,432
you have committed crimes
against the people

586
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:10,869
of Tsai Fu Village.

587
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,265
You have overseen corruption.

588
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:18,536
You have condoned
abuse and murder.

589
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:24,484
And tonight, your
reign of terror will end.

590
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:32,258
Come on!

591
00:57:32,316 --> 00:57:33,488
Take him down!

592
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,755
We won't take anymore!

593
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,286
I,

594
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,559
Li Kung, of Tsai Fu Village,

595
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:41,100
challenge you to a duel.

596
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,930
I accept Kung's
pathetic challenge.

597
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,260
We fight.

598
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,778
Come on,
Li Kung! Yeah!

599
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,618
Let the fight begin!

600
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:40,951
Come on!

601
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,161
Come on!

602
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:24,233
Come on!
Come on! Yeah!

603
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:38,268
Come on!

604
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,271
Yeah!

605
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:02,496
You don't bring a knife

606
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,761
to a sword fight.

607
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,805
One of your guards stabbed Li
Kung on the way to the arena!

608
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:09,099
You betrayed us again!

609
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,002
You got something
to say, Bolo?

610
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:15,612
You step forward and take
this lowly maggot’s place.

611
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,345
And you, old man!

612
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,942
You still got
some fight in you?

613
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:20,977
I got this.

614
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,032
What else you got?

615
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,532
I got him.

616
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,673
Arrest these traitors.

617
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:48,678
Hang them in the morning

618
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,878
so the whole village
can witness their execution.

619
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:54,649
Anyone else want
to join them?

620
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:59,684
You get to hang with
a mine dog, blackie.

621
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,022
I'm here like
a frog on a string.

622
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:08,833
Worthless.

623
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,434
Never thought I'd miss
all-American stock and chains.

624
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,734
It's hard for me to accept
that your arrival here

625
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,608
is a mere coincidence,
Thaddeus.

626
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:22,744
I simply was trying
to make it to the Wu Chi
temple to redeem myself.

627
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,680
They say at the temple,
there's a spring,

628
01:02:27,544 --> 01:02:28,784
a well of some sort,

629
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,086
with a concentrated
level of chi.

630
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:33,248
They call it
the Golden Nectar.

631
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:37,263
They say with this chi,
a man can reach immortality.

632
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:39,859
Me?

633
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,395
I'm just trying to
replenish my soul.

634
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,238
Well, in the mines,

635
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:48,039
<i>they found a water source.</i>

636
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:50,734
<i>Must be below the temple.</i>

637
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:56,912
Ho never wanted the silver.

638
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:58,875
He wants the water!

639
01:03:26,603 --> 01:03:27,604
Mayor Zhang!

640
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:30,912
Guess my arms still work.

641
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:37,489
Zhang, you saved our lives.

642
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:42,761
Up till now,
you and I have been partners
in the business of this town.

643
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:46,029
But tonight,
you became my friend.

644
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,798
If only I could show an ounce
of your bravery, Kung.

645
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:55,636
But it's hard to be great
man like you, with no legs.

646
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,336
If only I could
join your fight.

647
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:02,647
- Brother Kung's right.
- You saved our lives.

648
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:06,874
And to liberate this town,
it's gonna take all
the help we can get.

649
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,979
I can make you legs, Mayor.

650
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:11,717
And you can join the fight.

651
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,390
I am grateful for
the sentiment, but...

652
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:16,219
But how?

653
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:19,159
I could forge you legs.
The way I forged these arms.

654
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:24,901
I never have dreamed
of such a thing.

655
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:29,308
With legs,
I can stand with you all

656
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:32,135
and rid this town
of the Beetle Clan,

657
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:33,879
once and for all.

658
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,312
That's only half
of our problem.

659
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:38,986
That water
source in the mines.

660
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,017
We gotta get moving before
they find out we escaped.

661
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:47,488
Bolo, you get the miners ready
for battle by the break of dawn.

662
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:50,557
Cha Pow, you get
whatever Thaddeus needs.
Okay.

663
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,655
I'll meet everyone back
in front of the mines.

664
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:55,158
Thaddeus.

665
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:56,997
Brother Kung.

666
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,360
This is not for the
faint at heart.

667
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:22,756
You will be in pain.

668
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:24,691
I mean, a lot of pain.

669
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:28,392
When I lost my legs,
I lost everything,

670
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,032
even my chance
to have a family.

671
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,772
Well, I promise you
I'll help you walk again.

672
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:38,110
I'm not
touching anything else.

673
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,114
Cha Pow, increase the fire.

674
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,274
Legs.

675
01:05:58,822 --> 01:06:00,062
Thought I'd lost you.

676
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:01,157
Father.

677
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:04,428
You can't get rid
of me that easy.

678
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,407
It's time we stand up
and take back our lives.

679
01:06:30,854 --> 01:06:31,855
Are you ready?

680
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:36,701
I've been dreaming for
this moment way too long.

681
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:40,137
<i>Chi is a universal life force,</i>

682
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:41,770
<i>flowing through all matter,</i>

683
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:43,634
<i>organic and inorganic,</i>

684
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,204
but when one is able
to control this chi,

685
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:49,111
he can use it to
activate inanimate objects.

686
01:06:58,781 --> 01:06:59,782
Are you ready?

687
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:01,317
Gag him.

688
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:22,044
Okay, come on.

689
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:52,543
You have my eternal
gratitude, Blacksmith.

690
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:54,704
Let's get you walking.

691
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,379
You're standing!

692
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,293
Easy. Easy, my friend.

693
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,865
The journey of a thousand miles
starts with a single step.

694
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:49,829
What is your purpose here?

695
01:08:50,827 --> 01:08:52,067
I am Li Kung,

696
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:55,408
a simple worker
from Yin Silver Mine,
near Tsai Fu Village.

697
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,672
What business have you here?

698
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:00,572
I believe your sacred water
source is in danger, Abbott.

699
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:10,617
It's the mine.

700
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:20,200
<i>What we thought was
a mining operation for silver</i>

701
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:23,267
<i>turned out to be a mining
operation for your sacred wafer.</i>

702
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:27,538
<i>Master Ho is an evil man,</i>

703
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:29,709
<i>an indiscriminate killer.</i>

704
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:32,469
<i>He's trying to steal the Golden
Nectar our from under you.</i>

705
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,441
Who is he

706
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:39,284
to walk along a path where even
the mightiest have failed?

707
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:43,380
<i>Once, a truly powerful warrior</i>

708
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:47,387
<i>tried to steal the Golden
Nectar for his evil purposes.</i>

709
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,564
<i>But he was defeated.</i>

710
01:09:54,157 --> 01:09:57,331
<i>Being of royal blood,
we could not kill him.</i>

711
01:09:58,161 --> 01:10:01,404
<i>But we made sure
he was never a threat again.</i>

712
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:07,905
So now we must join forces
to protect the Golden Nectar.

713
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:12,678
Leave me alone!

714
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:16,979
Good.

715
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:30,035
My chi isn't enough.

716
01:10:31,027 --> 01:10:32,227
You must have patience, Mayor.

717
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,330
These things take time.

718
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:39,078
We don't have time.

719
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,111
Let him go.

720
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:51,956
He's right.
We don't have time.

721
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:12,071
Stop! Look at that!

722
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,942
Look. Do you see that?

723
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,579
What's that light?

724
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:22,723
The Golden Nectar
has reached the mountain!

725
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,480
One hundred men,
to the village.

726
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:30,831
The rest of you,
follow me to the falls.

727
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,565
Ah! Here you are.

728
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,674
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

729
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:44,433
And this

730
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,305
should look familiar
to you, slave boy.

731
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:50,051
You worthless Beetles
are about to get squashed.

732
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:51,340
Take him!

733
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:06,162
Kung!

734
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,100
Mayor!

735
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:13,511
What are you doing?

736
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:15,580
That is not your mayor!

737
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,440
That is Lord Pi.

738
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:23,278
You traitor!

739
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,848
Lord Pi!
I spared your life,

740
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:29,693
but I made sure you will
never walk or fight again.

741
01:16:31,387 --> 01:16:33,389
My legs have returned.

742
01:16:33,556 --> 01:16:37,766
And I will conquer these
lands once and for all.

743
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,238
You have followed
a misguided path, Pi.

744
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,306
Because of
your black friend

745
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,377
and the Golden Nectar,

746
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:49,373
the power of chi has fortified the
way of the Scorpion within me.

747
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:51,550
Not if I stop you first.

748
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,610
Bring the girl!

749
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:56,712
Father!

750
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:58,547
Innocence!

751
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:02,058
You touch her, I'll kill you!

752
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,392
Not if I kill you first.

753
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:05,087
You coward!

754
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:07,056
Pi!

755
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:10,097
I gave you the Golden Nectar
and I gave you the girls.

756
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:12,667
I'll take Kung.

757
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,138
He's all yours!

758
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:24,343
And you are mine.

759
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:10,886
Innocence!

760
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:30,539
Innocence.

761
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:34,311
No!

762
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:48,201
Thaddeus! Help!

763
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:14,918
No!

764
01:22:58,073 --> 01:23:00,644
I'm here. It's all right.
It's all right.

765
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,681
Innocence!

766
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:07,185
She's alive!

767
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:04,841
Well, brother Kung,
the winds of change
are upon you now.

768
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:06,979
Brother Thaddeus,

769
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:09,819
if fate indeed is
the master planner,

770
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:12,988
then may it smile
upon your journey.

771
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:16,022
And may fate cause
our path to cross again,

772
01:24:17,853 --> 01:24:18,854
brother Kung.

773
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:04,471
<i>So Cha Pow, he got a new job</i>

774
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,046
<i>and a new set of teeth.</i>

775
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:10,445
<i>The Abbott and the monks,</i>

776
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:13,286
<i>they continue to protect
the source of Golden Nectar</i>

777
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,556
<i>with the help of the miners.</i>

778
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,986
<i>Brother Kung,
he became mayor
of the village.</i>

779
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:26,725
<i>He took control of the mining
operations which brought great wealth</i>

780
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:29,268
<i>and happiness to the
long-suffering people of Tsai Fu.</i>

781
01:25:30,559 --> 01:25:33,233
<i>And me,
my journey begins again.</i>

782
01:25:33,762 --> 01:25:37,141
<i>You know, the Chinese say,
"Where there's iron,
there's rust. "</i>

783
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:41,311
<i>Yet rust only arrives
when the iron is not in use.</i>

784
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:46,185
<i>I may not find peace
in this strange land,
but I will find usefulness.</i>

785
01:25:53,849 --> 01:25:57,092
<i>You know,
it's funny how a man can be
a deposed wretch in one land</i>

786
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:58,821
<i>and a hero in another.</i>

787
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:01,499
<i>I guess that's just
the way of the Tao.</i>

788
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:02,591
So be it.

788
01:26:03,305 --> 01:27:03,268
