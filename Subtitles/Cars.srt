00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:41,495
OK... Here we go. Focus.

3
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,935
Speed. I am speed.

4
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:49,375
One winner, 42 losers.

5
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:52,005
I eat losers for breakfast.

6
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:55,545
Breakfast.

7
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:57,715
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

8
00:00:57,785 --> 00:01:01,485
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

9
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:05,425
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

10
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:07,085
I am lightning!

11
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,525
Hey, Lightning! You ready?

12
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:15,335
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

13
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:54,705
Ka-chow!

14
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,885
Get your antenna balls here!

15
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:52,625
Go, Lightnin'!

16
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:56,695
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick.

17
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:12,205
Uh!

18
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:25,535
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

19
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:29,225
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

20
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:32,295
<i>We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.</i>

21
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,395
<i>Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.</i>

22
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:38,075
<i>If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!</i>

23
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:39,205
<i>Right, Darrell.</i>

24
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,905
<i>Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,</i>

25
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:44,075
<i>heading into the final race
of the season.</i>

26
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:48,915
<i>And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.</i>

27
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,685
<i>Does The King, Strip Weathers,</i>

28
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:53,155
<i>have one more victory in him
before retirement?</i>

29
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:55,825
<i>He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!</i>

30
00:03:55,895 --> 00:03:58,095
<i>Can he win them one last Piston Cup?</i>

31
00:03:58,165 --> 00:04:01,535
<i>And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.</i>

32
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:04,125
<i>He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.</i>

33
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:06,365
<i>Chick thought
this was his year.</i>

34
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:09,205
<i>His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.</i>

35
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:13,335
<i>But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!</i>

36
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:16,045
<i>You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.</i>

37
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:18,745
<i>The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.</i>

38
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,315
<i>But everyone knows him now.</i>

39
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,445
<i>Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?</i>

40
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,115
<i>The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!</i>

41
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:30,065
<i>Three cars, one champion!</i>

42
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:43,735
No you don't.

43
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,435
Hey!

44
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:57,325
What a ride!

45
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:00,925
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

46
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:06,565
I love you, Lightning!

47
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:09,295
Dinoco is all mine.

48
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,305
Trouble, turn three!

49
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,605
- Get through that, McQueen.
- Huge crash behind the leaders!

50
00:05:36,495 --> 00:05:39,365
Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

51
00:05:39,435 --> 00:05:42,265
There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

52
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:43,565
Not in one piece, that is.

53
00:05:58,185 --> 00:05:59,885
Yeah!

54
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:01,925
Lightning! Oh!

55
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:06,295
Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

56
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,825
A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

57
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,025
Yeah! Ka-chow!

58
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:14,365
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

59
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:17,405
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!

60
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:19,705
While everyone
heads into the pits,

61
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:21,535
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

62
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,605
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

63
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,815
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

64
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:33,825
- McQueen made it!
- What?

65
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:34,945
He's not pitting!

66
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:38,155
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

67
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:39,985
McQueen's not going into the pits!

68
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:43,625
The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

69
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,995
- Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

70
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:48,295
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

71
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,775
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

72
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,245
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

73
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:14,225
Come on, come on, come on!

74
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:24,695
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

75
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:27,465
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- What?

76
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:29,665
You need tires, you idiot!

77
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:32,985
Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

78
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:34,485
Right. No tires again.

79
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:37,245
That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

80
00:07:37,315 --> 00:07:40,985
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

81
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:53,325
This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

82
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:56,265
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

83
00:07:56,335 --> 00:07:58,635
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

84
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:07,345
Checkered flag, here I come!

85
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:09,405
No! McQueen's blown a tire!

86
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:12,215
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

87
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:14,845
You fool!

88
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:18,695
McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

89
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,255
Go, go, go!

90
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:31,165
He's lost another tire!

91
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:34,475
- King and Chick come up fast!
- They're entering turn three!

92
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:36,405
Come on.

93
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:40,505
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

94
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:44,105
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

95
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:52,455
The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

96
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,595
Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

97
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:01,465
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

98
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:02,905
Lightning!

99
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:06,195
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

100
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:09,735
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

101
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,835
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

102
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:25,555
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

103
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,825
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

104
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:30,435
<i>We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.</i>

105
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:32,965
<i>McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.</i>

106
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:34,025
<i>Tell me about it!</i>

107
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,765
<i>Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?</i>

108
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:40,275
<i>Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.</i>

109
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:44,245
<i>I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?</i>

110
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:46,245
<i>I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.</i>

111
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:48,445
<i>- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?</i>

112
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:50,675
<i>No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.</i>

113
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,185
<i>What? Oh, yeah, right.</i>

114
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:54,315
<i>That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.</i>

115
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,015
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

116
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,785
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

117
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,555
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

118
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,615
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

119
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:06,295
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

120
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:10,425
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

121
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:12,205
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

122
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:16,035
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

123
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:20,075
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

124
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:21,805
Oh, whatever.

125
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:23,905
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

126
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:27,285
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

127
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:29,585
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

128
00:10:29,655 --> 00:10:32,185
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

129
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,925
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

130
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:39,555
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

131
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:41,465
In your dreams, Thunder.

132
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,635
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

133
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:47,535
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

134
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,405
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

135
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:51,915
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

136
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,675
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

137
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:55,215
Right in the lens.

138
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:57,545
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

139
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,915
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

140
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:10,685
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

141
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:11,755
Thank you, King.

142
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:14,595
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

143
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:16,035
It's the least I could do.

144
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:19,335
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

145
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:22,205
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

146
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:23,975
Kch-i-ka-chow!

147
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:26,705
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.

148
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:30,045
We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!

149
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:32,605
I love being me.

150
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:35,785
- OK, girls, that's it.
- We love you, Lightning!

151
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:40,595
Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.

152
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:42,225
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

153
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:44,095
You got more talent in one lug nut

154
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:46,725
than a lot of cars has got
in their whole body.

155
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:49,395
- Really? Oh, that...
- But you're stupid.

156
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,035
- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

157
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:55,205
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

158
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:58,305
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,

159
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,675
and you let them
do their job, like they should.

160
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:04,475
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.

161
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:06,455
Yeah...

162
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,755
Ka-chow! Ka-pow!

163
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,545
Oh, Lightning!

164
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:41,825
If you figure that out
you just gonna be OK.

165
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:45,515
Oh, yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.

166
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:47,025
Thank you, Mr. The King.

167
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:49,185
Ladies and gentlemen,

168
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:51,495
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...

169
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:55,265
A rookie
has won the Piston Cup.

170
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:56,725
Yes!

171
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:59,735
...we have a three-way tie.

172
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,445
Hey,
that must be really embarrassing.

173
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:12,175
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

174
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:16,655
Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race

175
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:20,955
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

176
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:24,465
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!

177
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:28,225
Hey, first one to
California gets Dinoco all to himself.

178
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:31,275
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!

179
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:37,775
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

180
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:40,975
Yep! All right! Got it!

181
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:44,505
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself."

182
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:47,215
Oh, we'll see
who gets there first, Chick.

183
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,385
Huh?

184
00:13:48,455 --> 00:13:51,785
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

185
00:13:51,855 --> 00:13:54,725
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

186
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:56,995
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

187
00:13:57,065 --> 00:13:59,055
Gotta make your personal appearance.

188
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:01,695
No. No! No, no, no, no!

189
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:04,235
<i>Yes, yes, yes!
Lightning McQueen here.</i>

190
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:07,935
<i>And I use Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!</i>

191
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:11,705
<i>Nothing soothes a rusty bumper
like Rust-eze.</i>

192
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:14,545
<i>Wow! Look at that shine!</i>

193
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:18,345
<i>Use Rust-eze and you too
can look like me!</i>

194
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:19,685
<i>Ka-chow!</i>

195
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:24,945
I met this car from Swampscott.

196
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:28,085
He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

197
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:31,025
You could see his dirty undercarriage.

198
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:35,335
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.

199
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:38,805
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

200
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,775
Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

201
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:45,805
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.

202
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,315
But remember,
all that salt and grime...

203
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:50,355
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

204
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:52,385
Hey, look! There he is!

205
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:54,425
Our almost champ!

206
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:56,155
Get your rear end in here.

207
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:58,245
Lightning McQueen,
you are wicked fast!

208
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,485
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!

209
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:02,625
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!

210
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,525
Yes, I know.

211
00:15:04,595 --> 00:15:06,155
"Fred." Fred, thank you.

212
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,825
He knows my name.
He knows my name!

213
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:10,865
Looking good, Freddie!

214
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:13,405
Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!

215
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,995
We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.

216
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:18,105
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

217
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:20,515
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

218
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:23,575
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

219
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,645
because the track is always lit.

220
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,915
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

221
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:37,595
- Ladies and gentlemen,
- Lightning McQueen!

222
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,505
Free Bird!

223
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,905
You know, the Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment team

224
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:47,835
ran a great race today.

225
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:50,575
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

226
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:52,835
And an insane
amount of luck,

227
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:57,445
...you too, can look like me.
Ka-chow.

228
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,555
- Hey, kid.
- We love ya.

229
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,095
And we're looking forward
to another great year.

230
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:05,455
Just like this year!

231
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,325
Not on your life.

232
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:13,125
- Don't drive like my brother!
- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!

233
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,195
<i>California, here we come!</i>

234
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:18,965
Dinoco, here we come!

235
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:12,715
Oh... oh... uh,
I needed this. Hello?

236
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:16,385
<i>Is this Lightning McQueen,
the world's fastest racing machine?</i>

237
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:18,585
Is this Harv,
the world's greatest agent?

238
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:21,425
<i>And it is such an honor
to be your agent</i>

239
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:24,525
<i>that it almost hurts me to take
ten percent of your winnings.</i>

240
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:29,695
<i>Merchandising. And ancillary rights in
perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!</i>

241
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,265
<i>I didn't see it,
but I heard you were great.</i>

242
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,465
Thanks, Harv.

243
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:37,205
<i>Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets
for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.</i>

244
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:39,975
<i>I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.</i>

245
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:43,175
<i>- You let Harv rock it for you, baby.
- Right. Friends.</i>

246
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,185
Yes, there's...

247
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:48,715
<i>OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.</i>

248
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:51,915
<i>So many you can't even narrow it down.
Hey, when you get to town,</i>

249
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:54,155
<i>you better make time
for your best friend!</i>

250
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:56,385
<i>Break bread
with your mishpocheh here!</i>

251
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:58,525
That'd be great!
We should totally...

252
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,365
<i>OK, I gotta jump, kid.
Let me know how it goes. I'm out.</i>

253
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:07,695
What? A minivan?

254
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,475
<i>Come on, you're in the slow lane.</i>

255
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:11,875
<i>This is Lightning McQueen
you're hauling here.</i>

256
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:14,475
Just stopping off
for a quick breather, kid.

257
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:16,985
<i>- Old Mack needs a rest.
- Absolutely not.</i>

258
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:20,785
<i>We're driving all night till we
get to California. We agreed to it.</i>

259
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:25,055
All night? May I remind you
federal DOT regs state...

260
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,185
<i>Come on, I need to get there
before Chick and hang with Dinoco.</i>

261
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:30,355
All those sleeping trucks.

262
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,165
<i>Hey, kid,
I don't know if I can make it.</i>

263
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:34,665
Oh, sure you can, Mack.

264
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:37,065
Look, it'll be easy.
I'll stay up with you.

265
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,005
<i>- All night?
- All night long.</i>

266
00:19:57,755 --> 00:20:00,425
Uh!

267
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:45,025
Ah-choo!

268
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:01,125
- Hey, yo, D.J.
- What up?

269
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:04,215
We got ourselves a nodder.

270
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:14,105
Pretty music.

271
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:17,565
Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man.

272
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:20,135
- Right back at ya!
- Yeah!

273
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:23,305
- Oops! I missed.
- You going on vacation?

274
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:46,065
- Oh, no, Snot Rod...
- He's gonna blow!

275
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:48,965
Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

276
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:50,335
Gesundheit!

277
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,505
One should never drive while drowsy.

278
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:10,015
Uh! Ah!

279
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,495
Mack!

280
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:22,735
Mack!

281
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:29,935
Mack!

282
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,845
Hey, Mack! Mack!

283
00:22:34,945 --> 00:22:36,505
Mack!

284
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:39,105
Mack, wait for me!

285
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:48,925
Mack!

286
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:11,575
Mack! Mack!

287
00:23:14,285 --> 00:23:16,225
Mack! Mack...

288
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,755
...wait up! Mack.

289
00:23:19,995 --> 00:23:21,755
Mack! Mack!

290
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:24,025
What? You're not Mack.

291
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:28,865
Mack? I ain't no Mack!
I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

292
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:31,865
Turn on your lights, you moron!

293
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,975
Mack... The Interstate!

294
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,525
Huh?

295
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:56,465
Not in my town, you don't.

296
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,565
Oh, no.

297
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,195
Oh, maybe he can help me!

298
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:07,535
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?

299
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:10,975
I haven't gone this fast in years.

300
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:13,875
I'm gonna
blow a gasket or somethin'.

301
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:16,275
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

302
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:18,045
What in the blue blazes?

303
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:19,645
Crazy hot-rodder.

304
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:25,245
I'm telling you, man,
every third blink is slower.

305
00:25:29,755 --> 00:25:32,415
The sixties weren't good to you,
were they?

306
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:45,035
What? That's not the Interstate!

307
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:46,975
Ah! Oh!

308
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,335
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

309
00:25:54,445 --> 00:25:55,775
No, no, no, no, no, no!

310
00:25:57,185 --> 00:25:58,275
Ow!

311
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:03,515
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?

312
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:05,655
- Incoming!
- Whoa, man.

313
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:07,055
- No!
- Hey!

314
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:09,395
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

315
00:26:10,365 --> 00:26:11,625
My tires!

316
00:26:57,275 --> 00:27:00,505
Fly away, Stanley. Be free!

317
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,625
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.

318
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:19,795
<i>We're live at the Los Angeles
International Speedway</i>

319
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:22,395
<i>as the first competitor,
Lightning McQueen,</i>

320
00:27:22,465 --> 00:27:24,765
<i>is arriving at the track.</i>

321
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:26,775
<i>Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?</i>

322
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,005
<i>What's your strategy?</i>

323
00:27:30,045 --> 00:27:32,735
<i>What? Did I forget
to wipe my mud flaps?</i>

324
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,645
<i>McQueen's driver arrived in California,
but McQueen was missing.</i>

325
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:41,675
<i>- McQueen was reported missing.
...to race an unprecedented...</i>

326
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:44,315
<i>Sponsor stated
they have no idea where he is.</i>

327
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,755
I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate
to see anything bad happen to him.

328
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:55,025
<i>I don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!</i>

329
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:58,195
<i>Lightning McQueen
must be found at all costs!</i>

330
00:27:58,275 --> 00:28:02,235
<i>They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?</i>

331
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,375
Oh, boy.

332
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,505
Where am I?

333
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,175
- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!
- Ah!

334
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:14,375
Boy, I was wonderin'
when you was gonna wake up.

335
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:17,155
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

336
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:20,125
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?

337
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:25,155
- What's going on here? Please!
- You're funny.

338
00:28:25,235 --> 00:28:28,295
I like you already. My name's Mater.

339
00:28:29,805 --> 00:28:30,795
Mater?

340
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,805
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

341
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:37,135
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

342
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,195
Uh...

343
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:41,675
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

344
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:42,775
What?

345
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:47,615
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

346
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,955
Where are you? Shoot!

347
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:51,585
You're in Radiator Springs.

348
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:55,055
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.

349
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:57,995
Oh, great. Just great!

350
00:28:58,065 --> 00:29:02,595
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

351
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:06,465
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

352
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:09,505
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

353
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:12,305
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

354
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,605
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

355
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:16,205
- Cool!
- Mater!

356
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:19,155
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

357
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,705
To not to.

358
00:29:20,785 --> 00:29:25,225
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

359
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:27,385
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

360
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,325
"Later, Mater."
That's funny!

361
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:31,585
Ah!

362
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:35,365
The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!

363
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:38,965
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

364
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:41,435
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

365
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:42,535
- Fascist!
- Commie!

366
00:29:42,605 --> 00:29:45,305
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

367
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,145
I gotta get to California, pronto.

368
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:48,375
Where's your lawyer?

369
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:51,715
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

370
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:56,915
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

371
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,985
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

372
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,695
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

373
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:06,525
All rise! The Honorable
Doc Hudson presiding.

374
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:07,995
Show-off.

375
00:30:08,065 --> 00:30:11,405
May Doc have mercy on your soul.

376
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:12,665
All right,

377
00:30:12,735 --> 00:30:15,865
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

378
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:17,845
I want his hood on a platter!

379
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:20,575
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

380
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:24,415
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

381
00:30:24,485 --> 00:30:28,145
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

382
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:29,745
I'm...

383
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:33,655
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

384
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:37,095
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

385
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,825
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

386
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:41,165
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

387
00:30:41,235 --> 00:30:42,705
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

388
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:47,735
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

389
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,275
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

390
00:30:50,345 --> 00:30:52,775
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

391
00:30:52,845 --> 00:30:54,785
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

392
00:30:54,845 --> 00:30:58,015
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

393
00:30:58,085 --> 00:31:01,645
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

394
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:03,685
- What the...? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

395
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:06,815
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

396
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:10,485
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

397
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:12,225
Agh! Ow!

398
00:31:12,295 --> 00:31:14,695
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

399
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:16,795
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

400
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,635
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

401
00:31:20,705 --> 00:31:23,305
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

402
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:27,075
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

403
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,145
Ka-ching!

404
00:31:29,215 --> 00:31:30,305
Ah!

405
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,385
I'll keep that in mind.

406
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:34,955
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

407
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:37,625
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

408
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,345
You know her?

409
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:42,395
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

410
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:43,455
What?

411
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:47,625
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

412
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:51,535
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

413
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:53,265
What do you want, Sally?

414
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:56,705
Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

415
00:31:56,775 --> 00:31:59,935
No. I know his type. Racecar.

416
00:32:00,015 --> 00:32:02,075
That's the last thing this town needs.

417
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:06,645
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

418
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:10,655
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

419
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:12,155
Here she goes again.

420
00:32:12,225 --> 00:32:14,925
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

421
00:32:14,995 --> 00:32:18,625
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

422
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:22,495
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

423
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,565
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

424
00:32:25,635 --> 00:32:26,795
Ignore him.

425
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:30,245
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

426
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,645
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

427
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:35,515
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

428
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:37,075
And if no one can get to you?

429
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:41,485
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

430
00:32:41,555 --> 00:32:44,385
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

431
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:47,855
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

432
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:51,455
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

433
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:55,025
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

434
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:58,225
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

435
00:32:58,305 --> 00:33:00,865
- Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

436
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,775
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

437
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:07,075
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

438
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:09,375
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

439
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,475
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

440
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:12,545
Oh, he can do it.

441
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,415
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

442
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:16,955
Fix the road!

443
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:20,585
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

444
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:25,195
Order in the court!

445
00:33:25,965 --> 00:33:28,735
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

446
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:30,795
- Yeah!
- No!

447
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,205
Nice ruling.

448
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:36,435
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

449
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:40,375
That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

450
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,275
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

451
00:33:42,345 --> 00:33:44,975
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

452
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:47,715
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

453
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:53,885
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

454
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,025
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

455
00:33:57,095 --> 00:33:59,825
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

456
00:33:59,895 --> 00:34:02,235
What? This place is crazy!

457
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:04,465
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

458
00:34:04,535 --> 00:34:07,525
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

459
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:08,595
What?

460
00:34:08,675 --> 00:34:12,235
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

461
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:13,905
You gotta be kidding me.

462
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,645
You start there where the road begins.

463
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:20,005
You finish down there
where the road ends.

464
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:24,255
Holy shoot!

465
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:27,195
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

466
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:30,825
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

467
00:34:30,895 --> 00:34:32,055
Five days?

468
00:34:32,135 --> 00:34:35,065
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

469
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:38,105
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

470
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:40,665
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

471
00:34:48,745 --> 00:34:50,975
Freedom!

472
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:59,815
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

473
00:35:00,595 --> 00:35:03,895
...and then...
then took the boot off.

474
00:35:05,365 --> 00:35:07,765
Whoo-hoo!

475
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:12,495
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

476
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:16,445
California, here I come! Yeah!

477
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:20,805
Oh, feel that wind.

478
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:22,835
Yes!

479
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:26,045
No. No, no, no.

480
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:28,655
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

481
00:35:28,725 --> 00:35:30,715
How can I be outta gas?

482
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,745
Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

483
00:35:34,825 --> 00:35:37,165
But how did,
how did... you...?

484
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,565
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

485
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:42,535
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

486
00:35:50,945 --> 00:35:53,345
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

487
00:35:53,415 --> 00:35:54,505
Hey, Sheriff.

488
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,845
<i>- Why here?
- Sono sempre stati qui.</i>

489
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:59,405
<i>- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.</i>

490
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:01,355
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

491
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:04,255
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

492
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:07,155
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

493
00:36:07,225 --> 00:36:09,955
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

494
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:12,935
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

495
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:16,365
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

496
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:18,665
That's why we made him the judge.

497
00:36:18,835 --> 00:36:23,005
<i>Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>

498
00:36:23,075 --> 00:36:24,445
Now, I'm not one to brag

499
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,815
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

500
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:29,305
Oh!

501
00:36:29,385 --> 00:36:32,215
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

502
00:36:32,285 --> 00:36:34,085
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

503
00:36:34,155 --> 00:36:36,415
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

504
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:41,185
No, no, no!

505
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,595
That won't be necessary.

506
00:36:44,665 --> 00:36:47,965
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

507
00:36:48,035 --> 00:36:50,665
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

508
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:54,095
Where's he goin'?

509
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:57,615
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

510
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:59,205
I shouldn't put up with this.

511
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:02,145
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

512
00:37:02,215 --> 00:37:05,245
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

513
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,715
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

514
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:11,415
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

515
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:15,485
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

516
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:17,865
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

517
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,025
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

518
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:22,095
I must scream it to the world!

519
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:26,405
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

520
00:37:26,475 --> 00:37:28,965
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

521
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:32,015
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

522
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:35,715
- What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

523
00:37:40,585 --> 00:37:43,145
Is that what I think it is?

524
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:45,985
Customers.

525
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,515
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

526
00:37:49,595 --> 00:37:50,965
- OK!
- Customers?

527
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,865
Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

528
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:56,495
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

529
00:37:56,565 --> 00:38:00,095
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

530
00:38:00,175 --> 00:38:02,835
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

531
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:07,315
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

532
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,045
- Honey, please.
- Hello.

533
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:13,085
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

534
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:15,415
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

535
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:16,515
How can we help you?

536
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:20,655
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

537
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:23,955
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

538
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,465
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

539
00:38:26,535 --> 00:38:29,365
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

540
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:32,495
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

541
00:38:32,575 --> 00:38:36,635
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

542
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,405
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

543
00:38:38,475 --> 00:38:41,675
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

544
00:38:41,745 --> 00:38:45,085
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

545
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:47,485
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

546
00:38:47,555 --> 00:38:49,885
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

547
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:53,115
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

548
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:56,925
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

549
00:38:56,995 --> 00:39:00,455
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

550
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:04,465
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

551
00:39:04,535 --> 00:39:05,695
No we just topped off.

552
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:09,645
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

553
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:12,175
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

554
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:15,575
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

555
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,815
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

556
00:39:18,885 --> 00:39:21,185
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

557
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:22,585
Maybe ghost flames!

558
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:25,215
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

559
00:39:25,295 --> 00:39:29,195
Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

560
00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:32,285
OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

561
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:33,855
Ow!

562
00:39:33,935 --> 00:39:37,135
A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

563
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,465
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

564
00:39:39,535 --> 00:39:43,035
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

565
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:46,705
OK! Yes. You bet.

566
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:49,045
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

567
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:52,205
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

568
00:39:52,285 --> 00:39:54,445
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

569
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,185
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:39:57,255 --> 00:39:58,725
No, not really. But listen.

571
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:02,425
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

572
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:05,025
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

573
00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:08,935
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

574
00:40:09,905 --> 00:40:12,165
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

575
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:16,105
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

576
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:19,335
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

577
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:21,505
I'm becoming one of them!

578
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:25,515
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

579
00:40:25,585 --> 00:40:27,345
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

580
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,285
<i>We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>

581
00:40:30,355 --> 00:40:33,085
<i>- That's good.
...after a Piston Cup update.</i>

582
00:40:33,155 --> 00:40:37,065
<i>Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>

583
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:40,585
<i>and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.</i>

584
00:40:40,665 --> 00:40:43,835
<i>It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.</i>

585
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:47,665
<i>You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.</i>

586
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,905
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

587
00:40:57,985 --> 00:40:58,975
Ha-ha!

588
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:03,815
Yeah!

589
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:17,765
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

590
00:41:18,235 --> 00:41:20,065
Oh!

591
00:41:20,135 --> 00:41:21,505
Let me get this straight.

592
00:41:21,575 --> 00:41:24,505
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

593
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:28,305
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

594
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,475
I got a road to finish.

595
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:43,725
- He's done!
- Done?

596
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,165
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

597
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:51,435
Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

598
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:54,375
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

599
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:58,635
Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

600
00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:00,805
Oh!

601
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,845
It rides purty smooth.

602
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:08,545
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

603
00:42:08,655 --> 00:42:12,145
Oh!

604
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:14,515
Red.

605
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:18,465
Who do you think you are?

606
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:21,835
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

607
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:25,335
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

608
00:42:25,405 --> 00:42:27,875
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

609
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:31,565
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

610
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:33,135
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

611
00:42:33,215 --> 00:42:37,445
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

612
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:41,315
- What?
- Me and you. That a joke?

613
00:42:41,385 --> 00:42:43,755
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

614
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:46,515
If I win, you do the road my way.

615
00:42:46,595 --> 00:42:48,115
Doc, what're you doin'?

616
00:42:48,495 --> 00:42:50,325
I don't mean to be rude here,

617
00:42:50,395 --> 00:42:54,125
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

618
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,725
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

619
00:42:56,805 --> 00:43:01,465
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

620
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,735
Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

621
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:10,305
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

622
00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:13,315
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

623
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:15,915
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

624
00:43:15,985 --> 00:43:21,115
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

625
00:43:21,195 --> 00:43:22,955
and no lollygaggin'.

626
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:24,585
Speed. I'm speed.

627
00:43:24,665 --> 00:43:27,225
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

628
00:43:28,465 --> 00:43:33,265
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

629
00:43:33,335 --> 00:43:35,865
- Peet stop!
- Uh...

630
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:38,805
The race is only one lap, guys.

631
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:41,365
<i>Uno lappo! Don't need any help.</i>

632
00:43:41,445 --> 00:43:45,285
<i>- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.</i>

633
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:50,455
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

634
00:43:50,555 --> 00:43:52,545
Gentlemen...

635
00:43:53,195 --> 00:43:56,025
...start your engines!

636
00:44:02,805 --> 00:44:05,165
<i>- Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.</i>

637
00:44:05,235 --> 00:44:08,335
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

638
00:44:08,705 --> 00:44:10,005
Luigi?

639
00:44:10,075 --> 00:44:13,275
On your mark, get set...

640
00:44:13,345 --> 00:44:15,575
<i>Uno for the money,
due for the show,</i>

641
00:44:15,645 --> 00:44:21,345
<i>tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!</i>

642
00:44:29,825 --> 00:44:31,165
Huh?

643
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:34,325
Doc... the flag means go.

644
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,735
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

645
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:40,535
Doc, what are you doing, man?

646
00:44:40,605 --> 00:44:44,165
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

647
00:44:44,245 --> 00:44:47,375
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

648
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:50,215
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

649
00:44:51,915 --> 00:44:53,355
You got your tow cable?

650
00:44:53,415 --> 00:44:55,615
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

651
00:44:55,685 --> 00:44:57,985
Oh, just in case.

652
00:45:06,535 --> 00:45:08,725
Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

653
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:10,535
No, no, no, no, no!

654
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:13,075
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

655
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:16,105
- Ow!
- Bad trip, man.

656
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:25,275
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

657
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,715
I'm confused.

658
00:45:27,785 --> 00:45:29,885
You drive like you fix roads.

659
00:45:29,955 --> 00:45:33,155
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

660
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:38,795
Ah!

661
00:45:39,535 --> 00:45:42,505
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

662
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:45,695
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

663
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:50,745
I can make a little turn on dirt.

664
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:52,245
You think?

665
00:45:52,315 --> 00:45:56,775
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

666
00:45:56,845 --> 00:45:59,315
<i>Hey, ése!
You need a new paint job, man!</i>

667
00:45:59,385 --> 00:46:02,355
- No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

668
00:46:02,425 --> 00:46:04,785
- That freak juice?
- Pass.

669
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:09,315
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

670
00:46:09,395 --> 00:46:10,985
Nah, not me, Flo.

671
00:46:11,065 --> 00:46:13,535
I'm on one of them there special diets.

672
00:46:13,595 --> 00:46:18,195
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

673
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:21,035
"You race like you fix roads."

674
00:46:21,105 --> 00:46:25,875
I'll show him.
I will show him!

675
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:38,555
Oh, great! I hate it!

676
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:42,255
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- Music. Sweet music.

677
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:46,025
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

678
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:48,825
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

679
00:46:48,905 --> 00:46:51,925
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

680
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:58,275
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

681
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:12,385
Wow.

682
00:47:12,725 --> 00:47:14,425
Mornin', Sally!

683
00:47:14,495 --> 00:47:19,695
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

684
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:21,795
Yes! Uh, amazing!

685
00:47:22,265 --> 00:47:25,895
Whoa-ho! Yeah!

686
00:47:25,975 --> 00:47:30,165
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

687
00:47:30,245 --> 00:47:32,805
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

688
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:37,005
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

689
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:39,275
<i>E bellissima! It's beautiful!</i>

690
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:43,085
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

691
00:47:44,025 --> 00:47:45,325
Boy, I tell you what.

692
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:48,225
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

693
00:47:48,295 --> 00:47:49,955
Doc, look at this!

694
00:47:50,095 --> 00:47:52,965
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

695
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:56,525
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

696
00:47:56,605 --> 00:47:59,575
Guido, look at Luigi!

697
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:01,905
<i>This is fantastico!</i>

698
00:48:01,975 --> 00:48:05,435
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

699
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:09,815
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

700
00:48:10,485 --> 00:48:13,175
That crazy old devil woman.

701
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:17,055
Oh!

702
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,955
She's right!

703
00:48:19,025 --> 00:48:20,585
- Ah!
- Guido!

704
00:48:20,655 --> 00:48:24,425
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

705
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:29,495
Well, now... where the heck is he?

706
00:48:35,845 --> 00:48:38,575
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

707
00:48:38,645 --> 00:48:42,015
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

708
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,445
and asked me if he could
come down here.

709
00:48:44,515 --> 00:48:46,915
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

710
00:48:46,985 --> 00:48:49,815
No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

711
00:48:50,285 --> 00:48:52,815
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

712
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:58,985
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

713
00:48:59,065 --> 00:49:00,465
I'll keep an eye on him.

714
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:04,435
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

715
00:49:18,815 --> 00:49:21,285
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

716
00:49:21,355 --> 00:49:24,085
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

717
00:49:24,155 --> 00:49:27,485
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

718
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:31,055
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

719
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,195
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

720
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:37,365
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

721
00:49:37,435 --> 00:49:39,095
I'll put it simple.

722
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:43,335
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

723
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:49,815
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

724
00:49:49,885 --> 00:49:51,675
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

725
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:55,345
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

726
00:49:58,155 --> 00:50:01,555
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

727
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:11,135
Turn right to go left.

728
00:50:12,405 --> 00:50:14,395
Hmm...

729
00:50:14,475 --> 00:50:15,535
Whoa!

730
00:50:16,905 --> 00:50:19,345
Oh!

731
00:50:19,815 --> 00:50:23,775
Ow! Oh, that...

732
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,715
Ow!

733
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:33,425
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

734
00:50:33,495 --> 00:50:36,585
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

735
00:50:36,665 --> 00:50:40,065
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

736
00:50:40,135 --> 00:50:44,065
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

737
00:50:50,945 --> 00:50:54,505
<i>- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?</i>

738
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:58,945
<i>- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>

739
00:51:01,555 --> 00:51:03,545
Oh, Lord.

740
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:05,245
Mater!

741
00:51:05,325 --> 00:51:07,485
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

742
00:51:07,555 --> 00:51:10,855
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

743
00:51:10,925 --> 00:51:13,765
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

744
00:51:13,835 --> 00:51:16,305
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

745
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:19,065
Oh...

746
00:51:19,135 --> 00:51:21,805
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

747
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:24,435
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

748
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:27,775
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

749
00:51:27,845 --> 00:51:30,145
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

750
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:32,245
You make-a such a nice new road.

751
00:51:32,315 --> 00:51:34,985
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

752
00:51:35,055 --> 00:51:36,645
Even though you not a Ferrari.

753
00:51:36,725 --> 00:51:40,815
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

754
00:51:40,895 --> 00:51:44,765
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

755
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:48,355
I like your style, eh?

756
00:51:48,435 --> 00:51:51,995
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

757
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:55,525
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

758
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:57,265
Oh, would you look at that?

759
00:51:57,345 --> 00:51:59,475
Ramone, Ramone!

760
00:51:59,545 --> 00:52:01,635
Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

761
00:52:01,715 --> 00:52:04,705
No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

762
00:52:04,785 --> 00:52:08,415
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

763
00:52:08,485 --> 00:52:13,185
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

764
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,125
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

765
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:18,685
Ah!

766
00:52:18,765 --> 00:52:20,895
Stop! Let me...

767
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,135
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

768
00:52:25,205 --> 00:52:27,225
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

769
00:52:27,305 --> 00:52:30,635
Stop, stop! That's cold!

770
00:52:30,705 --> 00:52:33,205
Help! Please! Stop!

771
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,645
Thanks, Red.

772
00:52:37,885 --> 00:52:39,145
What was that for?

773
00:52:39,215 --> 00:52:41,345
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

774
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:42,915
If you do, you gotta be clean.

775
00:52:42,985 --> 00:52:45,515
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

776
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:47,325
What, I...? I don't get it.

777
00:52:47,395 --> 00:52:49,985
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

778
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:53,295
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

779
00:52:53,365 --> 00:52:57,995
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

780
00:52:58,075 --> 00:53:01,935
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

781
00:53:02,005 --> 00:53:04,405
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

782
00:53:04,475 --> 00:53:07,745
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

783
00:53:07,815 --> 00:53:11,015
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- It's newly refurbished.

784
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:14,545
Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

785
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:18,755
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

786
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:22,195
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

787
00:53:23,695 --> 00:53:25,925
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

788
00:53:26,895 --> 00:53:29,365
Cone number one, if you want.

789
00:53:30,465 --> 00:53:32,835
Oh...

790
00:53:33,975 --> 00:53:37,705
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

791
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:40,875
Oh...
That's just a... Oh!

792
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:46,785
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

793
00:53:46,855 --> 00:53:49,485
Gonna... Yeah.

794
00:53:54,225 --> 00:53:56,825
You know, I knew this girl Doreen.

795
00:53:56,895 --> 00:53:58,385
Good-lookin' girl.

796
00:53:58,465 --> 00:54:01,765
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

797
00:54:01,835 --> 00:54:05,325
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

798
00:54:06,435 --> 00:54:08,905
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

799
00:54:08,975 --> 00:54:13,105
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

800
00:54:13,175 --> 00:54:17,345
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

801
00:54:17,415 --> 00:54:20,975
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

802
00:54:21,055 --> 00:54:23,355
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

803
00:54:23,425 --> 00:54:25,185
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

804
00:54:25,255 --> 00:54:28,245
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

805
00:54:28,325 --> 00:54:30,655
I can handle anything.

806
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:35,565
- I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it!

807
00:54:35,835 --> 00:54:39,365
- Tractor-tippin's fun.
- This is ridiculous.

808
00:54:39,435 --> 00:54:41,875
All right, listen.

809
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,935
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

810
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,845
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

811
00:54:48,845 --> 00:54:50,815
Mater!

812
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:52,315
Wait, Mater!

813
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:55,455
OK, here's what you do.

814
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:58,925
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

815
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,485
And they do the rest. Watch this.

816
00:55:08,535 --> 00:55:10,365
Oh!

817
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:15,635
Oh... Oh! Oh...

818
00:55:22,545 --> 00:55:25,675
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

819
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:29,555
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

820
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:32,215
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

821
00:55:35,195 --> 00:55:37,785
Oh!

822
00:55:37,865 --> 00:55:41,455
Oh! Oh...

823
00:55:44,505 --> 00:55:48,495
I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

824
00:55:48,575 --> 00:55:50,335
Oh, your turn, bud.

825
00:55:50,405 --> 00:55:52,805
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

826
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:55,105
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

827
00:55:56,245 --> 00:55:59,645
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

828
00:56:50,555 --> 00:56:51,955
That's Frank.

829
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:14,205
Run!

830
00:57:14,275 --> 00:57:16,275
Here he comes, look out!

831
00:57:17,285 --> 00:57:18,905
Whoa!

832
00:57:23,085 --> 00:57:24,885
Run! He's gonna get ya!

833
00:57:44,245 --> 00:57:45,335
Oh! Customers!

834
00:57:46,275 --> 00:57:48,045
Oh!

835
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:51,445
Ah, no, no, no.

836
00:57:51,515 --> 00:57:53,245
Oof! Oh!

837
00:57:54,785 --> 00:57:57,685
Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

838
00:57:57,755 --> 00:58:01,245
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

839
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:05,625
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

840
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,635
Oh, yeah... yeah.

841
00:58:07,695 --> 00:58:10,795
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

842
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:14,065
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

843
00:58:14,135 --> 00:58:15,125
Oh...

844
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:20,475
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

845
00:58:20,545 --> 00:58:24,815
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

846
00:58:24,885 --> 00:58:28,785
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

847
00:58:28,855 --> 00:58:31,585
Where, where?

848
00:58:31,655 --> 00:58:34,255
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

849
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:36,485
- Yes, you do.
- No way.

850
00:58:36,565 --> 00:58:37,755
- Way.
- Come on, look...

851
00:58:37,825 --> 00:58:40,265
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

852
00:58:40,335 --> 00:58:41,955
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

853
00:58:42,035 --> 00:58:43,895
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

854
00:58:43,965 --> 00:58:45,995
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

855
00:58:46,075 --> 00:58:47,595
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

856
00:58:47,675 --> 00:58:49,665
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

857
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:53,045
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

858
00:58:53,115 --> 00:58:58,015
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

859
00:58:58,085 --> 00:59:01,215
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

860
00:59:01,285 --> 00:59:03,945
What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

861
00:59:04,025 --> 00:59:05,425
Mater? Mater!

862
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:09,095
Mater!

863
00:59:20,235 --> 00:59:21,675
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

864
00:59:27,115 --> 00:59:28,445
Oof!

865
00:59:28,515 --> 00:59:31,915
Yee-hee!

866
00:59:32,385 --> 00:59:34,245
He's nuts.

867
00:59:36,085 --> 00:59:37,785
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

868
00:59:40,595 --> 00:59:42,325
Just need to know where I've been.

869
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:45,525
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

870
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:49,595
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

871
00:59:49,665 --> 00:59:52,895
Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

872
00:59:52,975 --> 00:59:56,495
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

873
00:59:58,005 --> 01:00:01,745
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

874
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:04,145
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

875
01:00:04,215 --> 01:00:07,245
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

876
01:00:07,315 --> 01:00:10,885
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

877
01:00:10,955 --> 01:00:12,615
with private helicopters.

878
01:00:12,695 --> 01:00:15,955
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

879
01:00:16,025 --> 01:00:18,155
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

880
01:00:19,965 --> 01:00:23,595
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

881
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:26,835
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

882
01:00:27,175 --> 01:00:31,875
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

883
01:00:31,945 --> 01:00:36,535
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

884
01:00:36,615 --> 01:00:39,415
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

885
01:00:39,485 --> 01:00:41,245
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

886
01:00:41,485 --> 01:00:45,285
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!

887
01:00:45,355 --> 01:00:47,185
In what?

888
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:50,025
My best friend.

889
01:00:56,465 --> 01:00:58,195
See you tomorrow, buddy!

890
01:00:58,275 --> 01:01:01,725
<i>McQueen and Sally
parked beneath a tree,</i>

891
01:01:01,805 --> 01:01:05,475
<i>K- i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!</i>

892
01:01:08,315 --> 01:01:10,905
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

893
01:01:14,855 --> 01:01:18,185
Number one. Number one...
Ah, number one!

894
01:01:19,195 --> 01:01:21,685
- Ah, this is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.

895
01:01:23,265 --> 01:01:25,885
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.

896
01:01:25,965 --> 01:01:28,095
I scared myself
scaring you scaring me.

897
01:01:28,165 --> 01:01:31,265
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared.
- No, of course not. No.

898
01:01:31,335 --> 01:01:34,065
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

899
01:01:34,135 --> 01:01:36,865
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

900
01:01:36,945 --> 01:01:38,935
Something about a helicopter ride.

901
01:01:39,415 --> 01:01:42,175
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

902
01:01:42,245 --> 01:01:44,145
- Did you mean it?
- What?

903
01:01:44,215 --> 01:01:46,245
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

904
01:01:46,315 --> 01:01:49,345
First things first. I gotta
get outta here and make the race.

905
01:01:49,425 --> 01:01:51,415
Uh-huh.

906
01:01:51,485 --> 01:01:54,685
You know... Mater trusts you.

907
01:01:56,065 --> 01:01:58,425
Yeah, OK.

908
01:01:58,495 --> 01:02:01,195
- Did you mean that?
- What?

909
01:02:01,265 --> 01:02:06,895
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

910
01:02:06,975 --> 01:02:09,635
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.

911
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:13,205
Yeah, OK. G'night.

912
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:16,805
Oh...

913
01:02:16,885 --> 01:02:19,075
Hey, thank you.

914
01:02:21,385 --> 01:02:23,045
What did you just say?

915
01:02:23,755 --> 01:02:25,955
You know,
thanks for lettin' me stay here.

916
01:02:26,025 --> 01:02:29,895
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.

917
01:02:29,965 --> 01:02:33,525
- Newly refurbished, right?
- Yeah.

918
01:02:34,435 --> 01:02:36,955
- G'night.
- Good night.

919
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:42,665
Hmm.

920
01:02:58,155 --> 01:03:01,175
Will you turn
that disrespectful junk off?

921
01:03:01,255 --> 01:03:05,085
Respect the classics, man.
It's Hendrix!

922
01:03:16,105 --> 01:03:17,595
Ah!

923
01:03:24,015 --> 01:03:25,135
No!

924
01:03:31,315 --> 01:03:34,615
No!

925
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:36,425
I gotta get outta here!

926
01:03:36,895 --> 01:03:39,825
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

927
01:03:39,895 --> 01:03:43,155
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Get a good peek, city boy?

928
01:03:43,235 --> 01:03:46,725
I just need my
daily gas ration from the Sheriff.

929
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:48,925
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.

930
01:03:49,005 --> 01:03:51,665
I've been trying
to get outta here for three days!

931
01:03:51,735 --> 01:03:54,235
Hope you enjoyed the show!

932
01:04:07,825 --> 01:04:09,615
Whoa, Doc.

933
01:04:09,695 --> 01:04:13,425
Time to clean out the garage, buddy,
come on.

934
01:04:29,275 --> 01:04:31,105
What?

935
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:35,015
He has a Piston Cup?

936
01:04:42,085 --> 01:04:43,855
Oh, my gosh.

937
01:04:45,225 --> 01:04:47,255
Three Piston Cups?

938
01:04:59,575 --> 01:05:01,565
Sign says stay out.

939
01:05:02,415 --> 01:05:05,005
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...

940
01:05:05,075 --> 01:05:08,175
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

941
01:05:08,245 --> 01:05:11,275
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

942
01:05:11,355 --> 01:05:13,875
Of course. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

943
01:05:13,955 --> 01:05:15,685
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

944
01:05:15,755 --> 01:05:19,415
You used to hold the record for most
wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

945
01:05:19,495 --> 01:05:22,225
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
- I tried that.

946
01:05:22,295 --> 01:05:25,025
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!

947
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:28,535
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

948
01:05:33,775 --> 01:05:39,075
You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPM's, man.

949
01:05:39,145 --> 01:05:40,945
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

950
01:05:41,015 --> 01:05:44,245
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
Whoo! That's your color!

951
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:48,045
- Yellow, baby.
- Mmm. You smokin' hot!

952
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:49,185
There he is.

953
01:05:49,255 --> 01:05:52,245
Oh, my gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

954
01:05:55,495 --> 01:05:58,265
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

955
01:05:58,335 --> 01:06:00,925
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

956
01:06:01,005 --> 01:06:03,265
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

957
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:06,635
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

958
01:06:06,705 --> 01:06:08,765
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

959
01:06:08,845 --> 01:06:12,435
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

960
01:06:12,515 --> 01:06:16,385
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

961
01:06:16,455 --> 01:06:18,785
I think the heat's
startin' to get to the boy!

962
01:06:18,855 --> 01:06:20,985
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

963
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,455
I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.

964
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:26,285
- Are you sick, buddy?
- You are lookin' peaked.

965
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:28,125
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

966
01:06:30,435 --> 01:06:33,955
- Hey! What are you doin'?
- It's OK. You can trust me, right?

967
01:06:34,035 --> 01:06:36,735
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

968
01:06:37,675 --> 01:06:40,005
Hmm... I trust him.

969
01:06:40,975 --> 01:06:43,275
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?

970
01:06:43,345 --> 01:06:44,645
Yeah, a drive.

971
01:06:44,715 --> 01:06:47,845
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

972
01:06:47,915 --> 01:06:50,615
Ah... No. No, we don't.

973
01:07:13,105 --> 01:07:16,945
Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?

974
01:07:22,755 --> 01:07:23,945
Mm-hm!

975
01:07:24,015 --> 01:07:27,475
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

976
01:07:27,555 --> 01:07:29,985
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

977
01:07:31,025 --> 01:07:32,995
That's so too much!

978
01:07:35,025 --> 01:07:37,495
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

979
01:07:37,565 --> 01:07:39,555
I don't know.

980
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,425
Whoa! Yes.

981
01:08:03,255 --> 01:08:04,885
Oh! Ah-ha-ha!

982
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:08,625
Bleah!

983
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,615
Oh!

984
01:09:34,885 --> 01:09:38,615
Wow. What is this place?

985
01:09:39,325 --> 01:09:40,685
Wheel Well.

986
01:09:40,755 --> 01:09:44,015
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.

987
01:09:48,665 --> 01:09:50,395
This place?

988
01:09:54,005 --> 01:09:56,065
Yeah, imagine.

989
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,465
Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

990
01:10:02,815 --> 01:10:04,365
You know, I don't get you.

991
01:10:04,445 --> 01:10:07,675
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

992
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,945
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

993
01:10:10,015 --> 01:10:14,185
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

994
01:10:14,255 --> 01:10:17,815
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

995
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:21,295
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

996
01:10:22,065 --> 01:10:24,695
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

997
01:10:24,765 --> 01:10:26,525
And you know what?

998
01:10:26,605 --> 01:10:30,225
It never felt... happy.

999
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:34,965
Yeah. I mean... really?

1000
01:10:35,045 --> 01:10:36,775
Yeah. So I left California.

1001
01:10:36,845 --> 01:10:40,145
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

1002
01:10:40,885 --> 01:10:43,675
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

1003
01:10:43,755 --> 01:10:46,745
Well, they all did. And I never left.

1004
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:49,715
Yeah. You know, I understand.

1005
01:10:49,795 --> 01:10:52,625
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

1006
01:10:52,695 --> 01:10:56,425
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

1007
01:10:57,395 --> 01:11:00,855
I fell in love.

1008
01:11:00,935 --> 01:11:04,595
- Oh.
- Yep.

1009
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:08,235
- Corvette?
- No.

1010
01:11:13,785 --> 01:11:16,545
I fell in love with this.

1011
01:11:28,565 --> 01:11:32,295
Whoa. Look at that.

1012
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:35,495
Look, they're drivin' right by.

1013
01:11:35,565 --> 01:11:37,765
They don't even know
what they're missing!

1014
01:11:38,775 --> 01:11:41,105
Well,
it didn't used to be that way.

1015
01:11:42,575 --> 01:11:43,905
Oh, yeah?

1016
01:11:43,975 --> 01:11:47,885
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

1017
01:11:49,015 --> 01:11:50,005
Really?

1018
01:11:50,085 --> 01:11:52,785
Yeah. Back then,

1019
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:55,725
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

1020
01:11:56,995 --> 01:11:58,325
How do you mean?

1021
01:11:58,395 --> 01:12:01,795
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

1022
01:12:01,865 --> 01:12:06,065
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

1023
01:12:07,565 --> 01:12:09,555
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?

1024
01:12:11,475 --> 01:12:14,275
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

1025
01:12:14,345 --> 01:12:16,905
They drove on it to have a great time.

1026
01:12:50,915 --> 01:12:53,315
Well, what happened?

1027
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:56,835
The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.

1028
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:26,595
How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

1029
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:29,475
Oh, I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

1030
01:14:29,545 --> 01:14:33,205
But one of these days we'll
find a way to get it back on the map.

1031
01:14:33,285 --> 01:14:36,945
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

1032
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:38,845
I had a great time.

1033
01:14:38,915 --> 01:14:41,645
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.

1034
01:14:42,285 --> 01:14:44,455
You're welcome.

1035
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:53,095
Hey, listen, listen!

1036
01:14:53,165 --> 01:14:56,265
If anybody asks you,
we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

1037
01:14:56,335 --> 01:14:58,425
Wha... what?

1038
01:15:13,755 --> 01:15:15,815
Oh, man, the paint's still wet!

1039
01:15:26,435 --> 01:15:28,295
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the store!

1040
01:15:28,365 --> 01:15:31,965
Hey! Don't eat the radial!
Here, take-a the snow tires.

1041
01:15:32,035 --> 01:15:34,335
- Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

1042
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:37,435
Then where did all these
gol-durn tractors come from?

1043
01:15:37,675 --> 01:15:40,015
- Whoa, boy!
- Hey! Hey, guys!

1044
01:15:40,085 --> 01:15:42,045
There's one goin' this way.

1045
01:15:43,015 --> 01:15:45,215
I got it.

1046
01:15:48,725 --> 01:15:51,025
Come here, little tractor,
come here.

1047
01:15:51,095 --> 01:15:53,355
Yeah, that's a good tractor.

1048
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:54,795
No, no, no, no, come here.

1049
01:15:54,865 --> 01:15:56,225
What are you doing?

1050
01:15:56,295 --> 01:15:58,995
You're not supposed to go
wandering off all...

1051
01:15:59,295 --> 01:16:01,665
...alone.

1052
01:16:12,045 --> 01:16:16,275
What are you doin'
with those old racin' tires?

1053
01:16:22,955 --> 01:16:25,255
Come on, Doc, drive.

1054
01:17:43,135 --> 01:17:44,935
Ah... Yeah.

1055
01:17:45,005 --> 01:17:46,665
- Wow.
- Huh?

1056
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,335
You're amazing!

1057
01:17:50,315 --> 01:17:52,575
What are you doin'?

1058
01:17:52,645 --> 01:17:54,345
Doc, wait!

1059
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,655
Giddup right in there!
Come on, Rusty.

1060
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:06,755
Doc, hold it!
Seriously, your driving's incredible!

1061
01:18:06,825 --> 01:18:10,125
- Wonderful. Now, go away.
- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!

1062
01:18:10,195 --> 01:18:12,025
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.

1063
01:18:12,095 --> 01:18:15,095
I'm a racecar,
you're a much older racecar,

1064
01:18:15,165 --> 01:18:17,155
but under the hood
you and I are the same.

1065
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:20,295
We are not the same!
Understand? Now, get out.

1066
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:23,305
How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?

1067
01:18:25,175 --> 01:18:27,645
You think I quit?

1068
01:18:40,225 --> 01:18:41,925
Right.

1069
01:18:42,565 --> 01:18:45,195
Your big wreck in '54.

1070
01:18:45,935 --> 01:18:48,235
They quit on me.

1071
01:18:48,305 --> 01:18:51,865
When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.

1072
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:54,835
You know what they said?
"You're history."

1073
01:18:54,905 --> 01:18:57,965
Moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line.

1074
01:19:00,815 --> 01:19:03,045
There was a lot left in me.

1075
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:06,775
I never got a chance to show 'em.

1076
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:12,315
I keep that to remind me
never to go back.

1077
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:16,655
I just never expected that
that world would...

1078
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,925
...would find me here.

1079
01:19:20,035 --> 01:19:22,625
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
- Oh, yeah?

1080
01:19:22,705 --> 01:19:23,695
No, I'm not.

1081
01:19:23,775 --> 01:19:27,605
When is the last time you cared about
something except yourself, hot rod?

1082
01:19:27,675 --> 01:19:32,275
You name me one time
and I will take it all back.

1083
01:19:34,115 --> 01:19:37,105
Uh-huh. I didn't think so.

1084
01:19:37,515 --> 01:19:41,285
These are good folk around here,
who care about one another.

1085
01:19:41,925 --> 01:19:45,055
I don't want 'em depending
on someone they can't count on.

1086
01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:47,655
Oh, like you?
You've been here how long

1087
01:19:47,725 --> 01:19:49,955
and your friends
don't even know who you are?

1088
01:19:50,635 --> 01:19:52,685
Who's caring about only himself?

1089
01:19:52,765 --> 01:19:55,565
Just finish that road
and get outta here!

1090
01:20:09,715 --> 01:20:12,415
Will you turn that
disrespectful junk off?

1091
01:20:12,485 --> 01:20:14,925
Respect the classics, man.

1092
01:20:24,665 --> 01:20:27,465
Ah...

1093
01:20:41,385 --> 01:20:42,745
He's done.

1094
01:20:42,815 --> 01:20:46,045
He must've finished it
while we was all sleepin'.

1095
01:20:46,115 --> 01:20:48,345
Good riddance.

1096
01:20:56,225 --> 01:20:57,665
He's gone?

1097
01:20:57,735 --> 01:21:00,755
Well, we wouldn't want him
to miss that race of his.

1098
01:21:06,205 --> 01:21:10,545
- Oh, dude, are you crying?
- No! I'm happy!

1099
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:13,575
I don't have to watch him
every second of the day anymore!

1100
01:21:13,645 --> 01:21:14,845
I'm glad he's gone!

1101
01:21:21,455 --> 01:21:23,255
What's wrong with Red?

1102
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:26,725
Oh, he's just sad
'cause you left town

1103
01:21:26,795 --> 01:21:29,725
and went to your big race to win
the Piston Cup

1104
01:21:29,795 --> 01:21:32,665
that you've always dreamed about
your whole life

1105
01:21:32,735 --> 01:21:38,265
and get that big ol' sponsor and that
fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.

1106
01:21:42,905 --> 01:21:45,205
Wait a minute!

1107
01:21:46,615 --> 01:21:49,445
I knowed you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1108
01:21:49,515 --> 01:21:52,245
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.

1109
01:21:52,315 --> 01:21:55,985
Don't worry. I'll give you
a police escort, and we'll make up time.

1110
01:21:56,055 --> 01:21:57,215
Thank you, Sheriff.

1111
01:21:57,295 --> 01:21:59,415
But you know I can't go just yet.

1112
01:21:59,495 --> 01:22:00,985
Well, why not?

1113
01:22:01,065 --> 01:22:03,895
I'm not sure these tires...

1114
01:22:03,965 --> 01:22:06,865
...can get me to California.
- Peet stop?

1115
01:22:06,935 --> 01:22:10,195
Yeah, does anybody know
what time Luigi's opens?

1116
01:22:10,275 --> 01:22:11,605
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

1117
01:22:11,645 --> 01:22:13,435
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

1118
01:22:13,645 --> 01:22:16,235
<i>Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!</i>

1119
01:22:16,305 --> 01:22:20,405
- Would you look at that!
- Our first customer in years!

1120
01:22:20,485 --> 01:22:24,075
I am filled with tears of ecstasy,

1121
01:22:24,155 --> 01:22:28,015
for this is the most glorious day
of my life!

1122
01:22:28,085 --> 01:22:32,085
All right, Luigi, give me
the best set of blackwalls you've got.

1123
01:22:32,295 --> 01:22:33,525
No! No, no, no.

1124
01:22:33,595 --> 01:22:36,965
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.

1125
01:22:38,095 --> 01:22:42,465
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.

1126
01:22:42,535 --> 01:22:44,005
But-a this...

1127
01:22:44,305 --> 01:22:46,135
Whitewall tires!

1128
01:22:46,205 --> 01:22:51,375
They say, "Look at me!
Here I am! Love me."

1129
01:22:51,445 --> 01:22:53,245
All right, you're the expert.

1130
01:22:53,315 --> 01:22:56,245
Don't forget the spare.

1131
01:22:56,315 --> 01:22:59,145
<i>- Perfetto. Guido!
- Peet stop!</i>

1132
01:23:10,535 --> 01:23:13,465
What did Luigi tell you, eh?

1133
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:16,995
Wow, you were right.
Better than a Ferrari, huh?

1134
01:23:17,775 --> 01:23:18,935
Eh... No.

1135
01:23:22,805 --> 01:23:26,405
Wow! This organic fuel is great!
Why haven't I heard about it before?

1136
01:23:26,475 --> 01:23:28,475
It's a conspiracy, man!

1137
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,015
The oil companies got a grip
on the government!

1138
01:23:31,085 --> 01:23:34,315
They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

1139
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:36,515
OK, I'll take a case.

1140
01:23:51,575 --> 01:23:53,035
Ow! Eh!

1141
01:24:01,885 --> 01:24:03,505
Ah... Yeah.

1142
01:24:04,055 --> 01:24:05,575
Ka-chow.

1143
01:24:06,455 --> 01:24:09,425
- Here she comes!
- Places, everybody. Hurry!

1144
01:24:09,485 --> 01:24:11,215
Act natural.

1145
01:24:11,295 --> 01:24:12,625
<i>- Hi, Sally.
- Buon giorno!</i>

1146
01:24:12,695 --> 01:24:14,525
All right, what's goin' on?

1147
01:24:14,595 --> 01:24:16,755
Ladies and gentlecars,

1148
01:24:16,835 --> 01:24:20,765
please welcome
the new Lightning McQueen!

1149
01:24:21,405 --> 01:24:23,395
Pow! What do you think?

1150
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,665
Radiator Springs
looks pretty good on me.

1151
01:24:25,735 --> 01:24:27,535
I'll say.

1152
01:24:27,605 --> 01:24:30,805
Ka-chow.

1153
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:33,405
You're gonna fit right in
in California.

1154
01:24:34,285 --> 01:24:37,405
My goodness. It looks like
you've helped everybody in town.

1155
01:24:37,485 --> 01:24:39,315
Yeah, everybody except one.

1156
01:24:40,555 --> 01:24:45,545
- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What'd he say?

1157
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:48,655
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?

1158
01:24:48,725 --> 01:24:50,925
Now, what was I
supposed to do after that?

1159
01:25:14,925 --> 01:25:17,715
They fixed their neon!

1160
01:25:25,135 --> 01:25:30,125
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby!

1161
01:25:34,445 --> 01:25:37,775
Just like in its heyday, right?

1162
01:25:37,845 --> 01:25:41,215
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1163
01:26:08,645 --> 01:26:10,075
Shall we cruise?

1164
01:26:10,145 --> 01:26:12,475
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1165
01:26:12,545 --> 01:26:14,015
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1166
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:18,415
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1167
01:26:18,485 --> 01:26:21,355
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1168
01:26:21,425 --> 01:26:24,785
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!

1169
01:26:31,265 --> 01:26:35,635
...and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1170
01:26:35,705 --> 01:26:40,035
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1171
01:26:40,105 --> 01:26:43,505
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."

1172
01:26:45,675 --> 01:26:48,675
Oh!

1173
01:26:53,015 --> 01:26:55,145
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1174
01:26:55,225 --> 01:26:57,515
Good evenin', you two.

1175
01:27:00,025 --> 01:27:05,255
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

1176
01:27:09,365 --> 01:27:13,165
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1177
01:27:13,235 --> 01:27:18,905
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1178
01:27:18,975 --> 01:27:21,575
Not that. That.

1179
01:27:21,645 --> 01:27:21,715
Customers?

1180
01:27:21,745 --> 01:27:24,045
Customers?

1181
01:27:24,115 --> 01:27:26,775
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1182
01:27:26,855 --> 01:27:29,015
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1183
01:27:30,155 --> 01:27:32,755
It's the ghostlight!

1184
01:27:32,825 --> 01:27:35,415
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1185
01:27:36,295 --> 01:27:37,765
McQueen, over here!

1186
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:40,595
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1187
01:27:40,665 --> 01:27:42,795
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1188
01:27:42,865 --> 01:27:45,595
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

1189
01:27:45,675 --> 01:27:46,665
Stickers!

1190
01:27:46,735 --> 01:27:48,905
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1191
01:27:48,975 --> 01:27:51,445
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1192
01:27:51,515 --> 01:27:54,705
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

1193
01:27:54,785 --> 01:27:56,375
Sally! Sally!

1194
01:27:56,445 --> 01:27:58,505
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1195
01:27:58,585 --> 01:28:00,315
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1196
01:28:00,385 --> 01:28:02,785
Come on, give us some bolt!

1197
01:28:02,855 --> 01:28:07,345
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1198
01:28:07,425 --> 01:28:10,795
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1199
01:28:10,865 --> 01:28:14,735
You are a sight
for sore headlights!

1200
01:28:14,805 --> 01:28:17,535
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1201
01:28:17,605 --> 01:28:19,465
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1202
01:28:19,535 --> 01:28:22,135
<i>Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?</i>

1203
01:28:22,205 --> 01:28:24,735
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1204
01:28:26,345 --> 01:28:29,285
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1205
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:32,615
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1206
01:28:32,915 --> 01:28:34,945
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1207
01:28:35,885 --> 01:28:36,875
- Harv?
- Come on!

1208
01:28:36,955 --> 01:28:39,655
<i>- Kid, I'm over here!
- How you doin', buddy?</i>

1209
01:28:39,725 --> 01:28:42,385
<i>My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!</i>

1210
01:28:42,465 --> 01:28:44,655
<i>- How do you think I'm doing?
- I can explain.</i>

1211
01:28:44,735 --> 01:28:49,135
<i>I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!</i>

1212
01:28:49,205 --> 01:28:52,265
<i>You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?</i>

1213
01:28:52,335 --> 01:28:54,805
<i>That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.</i>

1214
01:28:54,875 --> 01:28:57,175
<i>Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.</i>

1215
01:28:57,245 --> 01:28:59,765
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1216
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:03,045
<i>- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.</i>

1217
01:29:03,115 --> 01:29:04,315
<i>Playtime is over, pal.</i>

1218
01:29:04,385 --> 01:29:08,215
<i>While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.</i>

1219
01:29:08,285 --> 01:29:09,985
<i>- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!</i>

1220
01:29:10,055 --> 01:29:13,685
<i>Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.</i>

1221
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,925
<i>- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?</i>

1222
01:29:15,995 --> 01:29:19,625
<i>You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!</i>

1223
01:29:19,695 --> 01:29:22,965
<i>- Hey, that's my bit!
- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!</i>

1224
01:29:23,035 --> 01:29:27,025
<i>Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?</i>

1225
01:29:27,105 --> 01:29:28,835
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1226
01:29:29,005 --> 01:29:30,705
<i>No, wait. Where are you goin'?</i>

1227
01:29:30,775 --> 01:29:34,045
<i>Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?</i>

1228
01:29:38,185 --> 01:29:40,985
Sally, I... I want you to...

1229
01:29:41,625 --> 01:29:44,715
Look, I wish...

1230
01:29:46,195 --> 01:29:49,055
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1231
01:29:51,235 --> 01:29:56,425
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1232
01:29:59,575 --> 01:30:02,765
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1233
01:30:02,845 --> 01:30:06,075
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1234
01:30:06,145 --> 01:30:08,875
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1235
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:11,175
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1236
01:30:13,555 --> 01:30:16,575
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1237
01:30:16,655 --> 01:30:18,745
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1238
01:30:18,825 --> 01:30:22,055
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1239
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:24,225
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1240
01:30:30,065 --> 01:30:32,835
<i>- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?</i>

1241
01:30:32,905 --> 01:30:35,275
<i>- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!</i>

1242
01:30:35,345 --> 01:30:38,035
<i>You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.</i>

1243
01:30:38,115 --> 01:30:40,405
<i>You don't belong there, anyway.</i>

1244
01:30:40,485 --> 01:30:43,475
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1245
01:30:46,285 --> 01:30:48,515
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1246
01:30:55,665 --> 01:30:58,025
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1247
01:30:58,095 --> 01:31:00,495
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1248
01:31:08,975 --> 01:31:12,705
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1249
01:31:13,345 --> 01:31:16,475
Best for everyone or best for you?

1250
01:31:32,965 --> 01:31:35,765
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1251
01:32:35,325 --> 01:32:38,665
Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1252
01:32:38,735 --> 01:32:41,025
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1253
01:32:41,105 --> 01:32:43,335
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1254
01:32:43,405 --> 01:32:45,875
There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1255
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:48,495
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1256
01:32:48,575 --> 01:32:52,905
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1257
01:32:52,975 --> 01:32:55,535
The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1258
01:32:55,615 --> 01:32:58,945
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1259
01:32:59,015 --> 01:33:02,245
I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1260
01:33:02,325 --> 01:33:06,315
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1261
01:33:06,395 --> 01:33:08,725
In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1262
01:33:08,795 --> 01:33:12,895
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

1263
01:33:12,965 --> 01:33:15,595
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1264
01:33:15,665 --> 01:33:19,765
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1265
01:33:19,835 --> 01:33:22,935
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1266
01:33:23,005 --> 01:33:23,995
He's hot!

1267
01:33:24,075 --> 01:33:26,735
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1268
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:29,905
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1269
01:33:29,985 --> 01:33:32,505
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1270
01:33:32,585 --> 01:33:35,525
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1271
01:33:35,585 --> 01:33:38,355
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1272
01:33:38,425 --> 01:33:41,555
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1273
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:46,585
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1274
01:33:46,665 --> 01:33:50,565
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1275
01:33:50,635 --> 01:33:51,895
Sorry, pal.

1276
01:33:51,975 --> 01:33:56,235
OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1277
01:33:57,005 --> 01:33:59,805
I am speed.

1278
01:34:01,545 --> 01:34:02,745
Victory.

1279
01:34:02,815 --> 01:34:04,945
One winner, two losers.

1280
01:34:07,055 --> 01:34:12,585
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1281
01:34:17,765 --> 01:34:19,355
Lightnin'! You ready?

1282
01:34:19,435 --> 01:34:22,125
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1283
01:34:35,485 --> 01:34:38,315
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1284
01:34:38,385 --> 01:34:40,975
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1285
01:34:41,055 --> 01:34:43,455
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1286
01:34:43,525 --> 01:34:45,885
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1287
01:35:03,175 --> 01:35:04,575
Uh-oh

1288
01:35:15,455 --> 01:35:18,425
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1289
01:35:18,595 --> 01:35:20,825
And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1290
01:35:20,895 --> 01:35:24,025
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1291
01:35:24,095 --> 01:35:26,495
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1292
01:35:26,565 --> 01:35:29,625
Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1293
01:35:30,775 --> 01:35:33,895
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1294
01:35:35,205 --> 01:35:37,535
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1295
01:35:37,615 --> 01:35:40,515
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1296
01:35:40,575 --> 01:35:43,575
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1297
01:35:43,645 --> 01:35:46,815
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1298
01:35:53,655 --> 01:35:55,715
Agh! Shoot!

1299
01:35:55,795 --> 01:35:58,925
Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1300
01:36:05,205 --> 01:36:06,765
Come on, you can do it!

1301
01:36:06,835 --> 01:36:08,865
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1302
01:36:10,075 --> 01:36:13,275
Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1303
01:36:13,345 --> 01:36:16,575
McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1304
01:36:18,755 --> 01:36:20,915
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1305
01:36:20,985 --> 01:36:23,385
Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1306
01:36:23,455 --> 01:36:25,185
He lost momentum,

1307
01:36:25,255 --> 01:36:27,555
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1308
01:36:36,965 --> 01:36:39,025
McQueen spins out in the infield!

1309
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:45,605
Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1310
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:49,205
McQueen just doesn't have it today.

1311
01:36:50,385 --> 01:36:54,445
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1312
01:36:54,525 --> 01:36:55,955
I don't think I...

1313
01:36:56,025 --> 01:36:58,755
I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1314
01:36:58,995 --> 01:37:00,515
Doc?

1315
01:37:03,195 --> 01:37:05,825
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1316
01:37:05,895 --> 01:37:09,665
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1317
01:37:09,735 --> 01:37:11,635
You said you'd never come back.

1318
01:37:11,705 --> 01:37:15,295
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1319
01:37:15,375 --> 01:37:18,275
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1320
01:37:22,245 --> 01:37:25,745
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1321
01:37:25,815 --> 01:37:29,085
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1322
01:37:29,155 --> 01:37:31,145
Now, get back out there!

1323
01:37:33,395 --> 01:37:36,365
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1324
01:37:36,425 --> 01:37:38,725
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1325
01:37:38,795 --> 01:37:41,965
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1326
01:37:42,035 --> 01:37:43,725
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1327
01:37:43,805 --> 01:37:47,205
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1328
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:00,815
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1329
01:38:00,885 --> 01:38:04,655
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1330
01:38:04,725 --> 01:38:07,355
It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1331
01:38:07,425 --> 01:38:09,825
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1332
01:38:09,895 --> 01:38:12,595
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1333
01:38:12,665 --> 01:38:15,995
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1334
01:38:20,635 --> 01:38:22,665
<i>Wow, this is history
in the making.</i>

1335
01:38:22,745 --> 01:38:25,645
<i>Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!</i>

1336
01:38:25,715 --> 01:38:27,115
Hey, Doc!

1337
01:38:27,175 --> 01:38:31,345
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1338
01:38:36,255 --> 01:38:40,055
- McQueen passes on the inside!
- He's nearly a lap down.

1339
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:43,025
Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1340
01:38:43,095 --> 01:38:45,995
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1341
01:38:46,065 --> 01:38:47,655
<i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>

1342
01:38:47,735 --> 01:38:50,635
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1343
01:38:50,705 --> 01:38:54,135
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1344
01:38:55,305 --> 01:38:57,905
<i>Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>

1345
01:38:57,975 --> 01:39:01,145
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1346
01:39:15,595 --> 01:39:18,395
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1347
01:39:19,965 --> 01:39:21,225
What do you think of this?

1348
01:39:21,305 --> 01:39:23,465
Yeah, that's it, kid.

1349
01:39:26,775 --> 01:39:28,065
What?

1350
01:39:28,145 --> 01:39:29,935
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1351
01:39:31,715 --> 01:39:35,975
- I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1352
01:39:36,045 --> 01:39:39,015
What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1353
01:39:39,085 --> 01:39:40,915
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1354
01:39:40,985 --> 01:39:44,145
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1355
01:39:47,795 --> 01:39:50,995
Look at that boy go out there!

1356
01:39:56,705 --> 01:39:59,005
Oh!

1357
01:39:59,935 --> 01:40:01,495
No, you don't.

1358
01:40:04,575 --> 01:40:06,565
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1359
01:40:06,645 --> 01:40:10,085
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1360
01:40:10,145 --> 01:40:13,445
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1361
01:40:15,385 --> 01:40:17,515
We gotta get him
back out there fast

1362
01:40:17,585 --> 01:40:20,525
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1363
01:40:20,595 --> 01:40:22,755
Guido! It's time.

1364
01:40:27,035 --> 01:40:30,125
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1365
01:40:39,245 --> 01:40:40,675
I don't believe it!

1366
01:40:40,745 --> 01:40:42,445
That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1367
01:40:42,515 --> 01:40:45,075
It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1368
01:40:45,155 --> 01:40:46,845
It's gonna be close.

1369
01:40:48,525 --> 01:40:50,985
Yeah, baby!

1370
01:40:51,055 --> 01:40:52,425
<i>He's back in!</i>

1371
01:40:53,755 --> 01:40:54,745
Peet stop.

1372
01:40:56,195 --> 01:40:58,125
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1373
01:41:13,415 --> 01:41:16,475
This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1374
01:41:16,545 --> 01:41:18,915
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1375
01:41:18,985 --> 01:41:22,515
A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1376
01:41:22,585 --> 01:41:23,855
This is it, kiddo.

1377
01:41:23,925 --> 01:41:26,415
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1378
01:41:26,495 --> 01:41:28,925
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1379
01:41:28,995 --> 01:41:30,395
Go!

1380
01:41:33,095 --> 01:41:34,225
We'll see about that!

1381
01:41:35,735 --> 01:41:37,295
McQueen's going inside!

1382
01:41:40,275 --> 01:41:43,295
- Chick and King are loose!
- I think McQueen's out!

1383
01:41:53,985 --> 01:41:56,455
- McQueen saved it!
- He's back on the track!

1384
01:41:56,855 --> 01:41:59,515
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1385
01:42:00,595 --> 01:42:04,225
Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...

1386
01:42:05,795 --> 01:42:08,795
Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1387
01:42:08,865 --> 01:42:10,965
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1388
01:42:12,475 --> 01:42:16,275
I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1389
01:42:26,615 --> 01:42:28,515
Oh, no!

1390
01:42:47,035 --> 01:42:49,235
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1391
01:42:49,305 --> 01:42:53,035
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1392
01:42:54,345 --> 01:42:56,475
What's he up to, Doc?

1393
01:43:06,855 --> 01:43:08,225
What are you doin', kid?

1394
01:43:08,295 --> 01:43:11,525
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1395
01:43:14,705 --> 01:43:17,695
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1396
01:43:17,765 --> 01:43:21,365
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1397
01:43:21,445 --> 01:43:23,495
It's just an empty cup.

1398
01:43:25,615 --> 01:43:28,175
Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1399
01:43:28,245 --> 01:43:31,915
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

1400
01:43:31,985 --> 01:43:34,285
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1401
01:43:34,355 --> 01:43:37,045
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1402
01:43:37,125 --> 01:43:39,385
That's what I call racin'.

1403
01:43:55,345 --> 01:43:58,405
<i>- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!</i>

1404
01:43:58,475 --> 01:44:01,075
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1405
01:44:01,145 --> 01:44:05,675
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1406
01:44:07,715 --> 01:44:11,155
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1407
01:44:11,225 --> 01:44:12,625
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1408
01:44:12,695 --> 01:44:15,665
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1409
01:44:15,725 --> 01:44:18,855
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1410
01:44:18,935 --> 01:44:21,165
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1411
01:44:21,235 --> 01:44:24,825
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1412
01:44:24,905 --> 01:44:28,205
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1413
01:44:28,275 --> 01:44:29,745
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1414
01:44:29,905 --> 01:44:31,435
- Boo!
- Boo!

1415
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:34,605
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1416
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:36,775
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1417
01:44:42,685 --> 01:44:45,175
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1418
01:44:47,595 --> 01:44:50,025
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1419
01:44:50,095 --> 01:44:52,085
You're The King! Yeah!

1420
01:45:02,505 --> 01:45:05,965
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1421
01:45:09,185 --> 01:45:11,805
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1422
01:45:12,015 --> 01:45:13,675
Thanks, Doc.

1423
01:45:14,825 --> 01:45:16,155
Hey, Lightnin'.

1424
01:45:16,225 --> 01:45:18,885
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1425
01:45:19,795 --> 01:45:22,815
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1426
01:45:22,895 --> 01:45:25,655
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1427
01:45:30,365 --> 01:45:31,835
But I didn't win.

1428
01:45:31,905 --> 01:45:35,565
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1429
01:45:35,645 --> 01:45:38,335
He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1430
01:45:38,415 --> 01:45:42,575
buzzards used to circle the car!

1431
01:45:42,645 --> 01:45:44,375
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1432
01:45:44,445 --> 01:45:48,185
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1433
01:45:49,725 --> 01:45:51,455
I'm gonna stick with them.

1434
01:45:51,525 --> 01:45:54,585
Well, I sure can respect that.

1435
01:45:54,665 --> 01:45:55,825
Still, you know,

1436
01:45:55,895 --> 01:45:59,765
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1437
01:45:59,835 --> 01:46:02,355
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1438
01:46:03,835 --> 01:46:06,825
Actually, there is one thing.

1439
01:46:07,535 --> 01:46:09,765
Whoo-hoo!

1440
01:46:09,845 --> 01:46:13,705
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

1441
01:46:18,215 --> 01:46:21,205
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1442
01:46:24,855 --> 01:46:27,155
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1443
01:46:30,295 --> 01:46:33,735
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1444
01:46:33,795 --> 01:46:34,785
to get tires.

1445
01:46:34,865 --> 01:46:39,065
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1446
01:46:39,135 --> 01:46:44,335
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1447
01:46:44,405 --> 01:46:46,705
A real Ferrari!

1448
01:46:46,775 --> 01:46:48,905
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1449
01:46:48,985 --> 01:46:52,435
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

1450
01:46:53,755 --> 01:46:57,315
<i>Wow.
Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.</i>

1451
01:46:57,385 --> 01:46:59,725
<i>Mi dicono che siete fantastici.</i>

1452
01:47:16,005 --> 01:47:17,535
Just passin' through?

1453
01:47:17,605 --> 01:47:19,905
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

1454
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:23,245
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

1455
01:47:23,315 --> 01:47:27,085
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1456
01:47:27,155 --> 01:47:29,625
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

1457
01:47:29,685 --> 01:47:32,525
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

1458
01:47:32,595 --> 01:47:35,085
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1459
01:47:35,165 --> 01:47:39,295
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

1460
01:47:39,365 --> 01:47:41,525
blah, blah, blah.

1461
01:47:41,935 --> 01:47:44,925
<i>McQueen and Sally
parked beneath the tree,</i>

1462
01:47:45,005 --> 01:47:49,635
<i>K- i-s-s... uh... i- n-t!</i>

1463
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:51,975
Great timing, Mater!

1464
01:47:52,045 --> 01:47:56,035
Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!

1465
01:47:56,115 --> 01:47:58,545
He's my best friend.
What're you gonna do?

1466
01:47:58,615 --> 01:48:01,555
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1467
01:48:01,625 --> 01:48:04,315
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

1468
01:48:04,385 --> 01:48:06,985
Hmm... Nah.

1469
01:48:08,725 --> 01:48:10,965
Yeah! Ka-chow!

1470
01:49:16,025 --> 01:49:20,025
Ah-choo!

1471
01:49:22,835 --> 01:49:25,825
All right, everybody
please keep together now.

1472
01:49:25,905 --> 01:49:30,675
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.

1473
01:49:30,745 --> 01:49:33,715
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

1474
01:49:33,775 --> 01:49:37,835
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1475
01:49:37,915 --> 01:49:41,375
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

1476
01:49:41,455 --> 01:49:45,255
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.

1477
01:49:48,595 --> 01:49:51,755
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Yeah!

1478
01:49:51,825 --> 01:49:54,355
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

1479
01:49:54,435 --> 01:49:57,495
Not today, old man.
I know all your tricks.

1480
01:50:01,775 --> 01:50:03,705
Doc! Doc!

1481
01:50:04,005 --> 01:50:05,475
Whoo-ah!

1482
01:50:05,945 --> 01:50:08,135
Not all my tricks, rookie!

1483
01:50:24,765 --> 01:50:28,255
Attention!
Kiss the pavement goodbye.

1484
01:50:28,335 --> 01:50:31,765
When I'm finished, you'll have mud
in places you didn't know you had!

1485
01:50:31,835 --> 01:50:35,675
- Yo, I've never been off-road!
- Well, that's gonna change right now!

1486
01:50:35,945 --> 01:50:38,845
About face!
Drop and give me 20 miles!

1487
01:50:38,905 --> 01:50:40,905
Go! Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1488
01:50:40,975 --> 01:50:43,815
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!

1489
01:50:46,455 --> 01:50:48,445
Huh? Look at this!

1490
01:50:48,515 --> 01:50:50,685
It's my hood! It's my hood!

1491
01:50:50,755 --> 01:50:53,845
I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!

1492
01:50:54,455 --> 01:50:58,415
Well, it fits perfectly.
How do I look? Ah-choo!

1493
01:51:04,105 --> 01:51:05,365
Oh, dang.

1494
01:51:10,545 --> 01:51:14,065
<i>You are a toy car!</i>

1495
01:51:14,145 --> 01:51:18,915
<i>You are a sad, strange little wagon
and you have my pity. Farewell.</i>

1496
01:51:19,315 --> 01:51:22,045
<i>Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, you loony!</i>

1497
01:51:22,115 --> 01:51:25,815
<i>Hey, I hate to break up the road rally,
guys, but they're here!</i>

1498
01:51:25,895 --> 01:51:28,255
<i>Birthday guests at three o'clock!</i>

1499
01:51:28,325 --> 01:51:31,655
Oh, man! Whoever does
the voice of that piggy truck,

1500
01:51:31,725 --> 01:51:34,285
I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!

1501
01:51:34,835 --> 01:51:39,035
<i>We're banished, genius! Stuck here
in this wasteland without chains!</i>

1502
01:51:39,105 --> 01:51:42,865
<i>But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble!
She needs our help!</i>

1503
01:51:42,945 --> 01:51:47,205
<i>- You're still not listening!
- Ah!</i>

1504
01:51:47,275 --> 01:51:50,905
<i>Welcome to the Himalayas!
Snow cone?</i>

1505
01:51:51,215 --> 01:51:54,915
Oh, that Abominable Snowplow
is quite the comic thespian!

1506
01:51:55,455 --> 01:51:57,445
<i>Just get in there.
Go! Go, go, go!</i>

1507
01:51:57,525 --> 01:51:58,925
<i>Circus cars?</i>

1508
01:51:58,985 --> 01:52:01,455
<i>How can you be circus cars?</i>

1509
01:52:01,525 --> 01:52:04,055
<i>These are the lousiest
circus cars in the world,</i>

1510
01:52:04,125 --> 01:52:06,115
<i>and they're gonna make me rich!</i>

1511
01:52:06,195 --> 01:52:07,325
Wait a minute here.

1512
01:52:07,395 --> 01:52:09,865
They're just usin' the same actor
over and over.

1513
01:52:09,935 --> 01:52:12,495
What kind of a cut-rate production
