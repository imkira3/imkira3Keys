2
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:41,665
What are you doing there, fella?

3
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,129
I just cut these...

4
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:51,258
You better come along with us.

5
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:12,197
Taking it off here, Boss?

6
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,698
Yeah, take it off, Dragline.

7
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:26,049
- Wiping it off here, Boss?
- All right, Koko, wipe it off.

8
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:28,259
Drinking it up here, Boss?

9
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,511
All right, drink it up, Gambler.

10
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:32,883
Hey, Rabbitt, water him down.

11
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:47,364
- All right, break it up!
- Yes, sir!

12
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:05,415
You eyeballing there, Society?

13
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,216
Checking my yo-yo, Boss.

14
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:20,516
Drag, new-meat bus.

15
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:29,447
Bunch. Must be half a dozen new-meat.

16
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:35,406
- No more than five, for a cold drink.
- You're on.

17
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:39,117
Babalugats, got a bet here.

18
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:17,070
All right, you men get lined up here.

19
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:20,822
Dog Boy, shut them dogs up.

20
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:23,538
They just smell new-meat, that's all, Boss.

21
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:32,300
What did they bring us today?

22
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,051
Come on, Blue.

23
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:42,603
"Gibson, 507. Manslaughter."

24
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,349
Good for a two spot.

25
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:46,849
It was an accident.
I've never been in trouble before.

26
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,223
You call the Captain, "Captain."

27
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,732
"Edgar Potter, 302 and resisting arrest."

28
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:54,064
"One year."

29
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:56,649
I was trying to keep in out of the rain.

30
00:04:57,745 --> 00:05:00,497
Get the wax out of your ears.
You call the Captain, "Captain."

31
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:01,613
Yes, sir.

32
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,581
And you call the rest of us "Boss,"
you hear?

33
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:04,747
Yes, Boss.

34
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:08,205
This man is going to make us
proud of him, Mr. Hunnicutt.

35
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:11,298
"Raymond Pratt."

36
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:12,964
Yes, Captain.

37
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:15,626
"Breaking, entering, and assault."

38
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:17,680
Five spot.

39
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:19,219
And a seaman.

40
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:22,846
Suspect that should come in real handy
around here, Captain.

41
00:05:22,937 --> 00:05:24,182
Maybe.

42
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:26,015
"Lucas Jackson."

43
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:27,352
Here, Captain.

44
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:31,391
"Maliciously destroying municipal
property while under the influence."

45
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,231
What was that?

46
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:37,612
Cutting the heads off of parking meters,
Captain.

47
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,204
We ain't never had one of them before.

48
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,662
Where do you think
that's going to get you?

49
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:47,621
I guess you could say
I wasn't thinking, Captain.

50
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:52,341
It says here that you did real good
in the war.

51
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:55,960
A Silver Star, Bronze Star,
couple of Purple Hearts...

52
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:59,965
Sergeant. Then come out
the same way you went in.

53
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:01,678
Buck Private.

54
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:04,807
Like I was just passing time, Captain.

55
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:09,606
Well, you got yourself some time now.
"Two years."

56
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,605
Well, hell, that ain't much.

57
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:15,530
We got a couple of men here
doing 20 spot.

58
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:18,106
We got one that's got all of it.

59
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:22,198
We got all kinds,
and you're going to fit in real good.

60
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:25,873
Of course, in case you get rabbit
in your blood...

61
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:30,537
and you decide to take off for home,
you get a bonus of some time...

62
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,880
and a set of leg chains to keep you
slowed down just a little bit.

63
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:37,881
For your own good, you'll learn the rules.

64
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:41,630
It's all up to you.

65
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:47,434
Now, I can be a good guy
or I can be one real mean son of a bitch.

66
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:55,106
It's all up to you.

67
00:06:55,988 --> 00:06:57,732
All right, let's move it.

68
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,833
One at a time. Move it!

69
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:29,807
Them clothes got laundry numbers
on them.

70
00:07:29,897 --> 00:07:32,815
You remember your number and always
wear the ones that has your number.

71
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,940
Any man forgets his number
spends a night in the box.

72
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:37,234
These here spoons you keep with you.

73
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:39,528
Any man loses his spoon
spends a night in the box.

74
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:41,774
There's no playing grab-ass
or fighting in the building.

75
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:44,904
You got a grudge against another man,
you fight him Saturday afternoon.

76
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:48,281
Any man playing grab-ass or fighting
in the building spends a night in the box.

77
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:51,790
First bell's at five minutes of 8:00
when you will get in your bunk.

78
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:53,253
Last bell is at 8:00.

79
00:07:53,337 --> 00:07:56,208
Any man not in his bunk at 8:00
spends the night in the box.

80
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:58,375
There is no smoking
in the prone position in bed.

81
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:01,137
To smoke you must have both legs
over the side of your bunk.

82
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,343
Any man caught smoking
in the prone position in bed...

83
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,091
spends a night in the box.

84
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:06,262
You get two sheets.

85
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,639
Every Saturday, you put the clean sheet
on the top...

86
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:09,807
the top sheet on the bottom...

87
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:11,687
the bottom sheet you turn in
to the laundry boy.

88
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:14,346
Any man turns in the wrong sheet
spends a night in the box.

89
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,731
No one'll sit on the bunks
with dirty pants on.

90
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:20,153
Any man with dirty pants on sitting on
the bunk spends a night in the box.

91
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,359
Any man don't bring back his empty
pop bottle spends a night in the box.

92
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:26,701
Any man loud talking
spends a night in the box.

93
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:29,243
You got questions, you come to me.

94
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:33,617
I'm Carr, the floor walker.
I'm responsible for order in here.

95
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:36,246
Any man don't keep order
spends a night in...

96
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:37,619
The box.

97
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:41,676
I hope you ain't going to be a hard case.

98
00:08:51,395 --> 00:08:54,017
Ain't but four. What did I tell you?
You owe me a cold drink.

99
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:55,731
I owe you. I owe you.

100
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,727
Move it.

101
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:04,653
Hey, any of you guys from Connecticut?

102
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:07,692
Forget it.

103
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,406
Wash them up!

104
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,249
Wash them up!

105
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:14,709
Move!

106
00:09:21,884 --> 00:09:26,178
Well, what are you still doing here?
Get at them beans! Move!

107
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:40,186
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven.

108
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,648
Next time you stay out of my place.

109
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:46,028
You try that again and I'll bounce you
all over the floor.

110
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,109
Well, man, I didn't know
it was your special seat.

111
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:49,994
You don't take another man's seat, man.

112
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,739
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything...

113
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:55,531
You better mind you manners, boy.
You're acting like a hillbilly tramp.

114
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:57,666
"Tramp." There you go, beauty.

115
00:09:57,837 --> 00:10:00,458
Hey, yeah, man,
you got your bull-gang name now.

116
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:03,335
Yeah, well, it ain't no worse
than some I been called.

117
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:04,588
When I was in the Navy...

118
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:05,957
All you new-meats...

119
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,758
you're going to have to shape up
fast and hard for this gang.

120
00:10:08,848 --> 00:10:10,176
We got rules here.

121
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:11,345
In order to learn them...

122
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:14,221
you gotta do more work
with your ears than with your mouth.

123
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:18,105
Somebody say something?

124
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,230
No, I didn't say nothing, Boss.

125
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:22,438
What have we got there?

126
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:24,070
Got a Lucas Jackson.

127
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:28,568
You don't have a name here
until Dragline gives you one.

128
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:33,370
Maybe we ought to call it "No-Ears."
You don't listen much, do you, boy?

129
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:35,283
I ain't heard that much worth listening to.

130
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:38,909
Just a lot of guys laying down
a lot of rules and regulations.

131
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,624
New-meat looks like a poker player, Drag.

132
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:44,375
Yeah, come on. Bet that eight.

133
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,127
Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me none.

134
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:47,878
I know you got $5 pocket money.

135
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,802
That would buy you a whole fistful
of cards. You in or out?

136
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:53,428
Out.

137
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:58,681
All right, come on.
It's a nickel to you, Drag. Let's go.

138
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,732
- Come on, Drag.
- Dime.

139
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:07,394
First bell.

140
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,495
All right, break it up.

141
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,245
How'd you get that scar?

142
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:20,450
What scar?

143
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:23,703
Last bell.

144
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:25,085
Last bell.

145
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:57,742
Fifty, Boss.

146
00:11:57,832 --> 00:11:59,492
Right, Carr. Fifty.

147
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:12,385
Getting up here, Carr?

148
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:14,345
Hey, now.

149
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:31,693
- Twenty-eight.
- Twenty-nine.

150
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:33,027
- Thirty.
- Thirty-one.

151
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:35,110

152
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:37,444
- Thirty-four.

153
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:21,914
- Twenty-one.
- Twenty-two.

154
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,410
- Twenty-three.
- Twenty-four.

155
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,699
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-six.

156
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:26,122
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-eight.

157
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:27,955
- Twenty-nine.
- Thirty.

158
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,039
- Thirty-one.
- Thirty-two.

159
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:32,041
- Thirty-three.
- Thirty-four.

160
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:34,341
- Thirty-five.
- Thirty-six.

161
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:38,758
Get out of my eyeballing seat,
you new-meat dummy.

162
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:13,589
I'm a salesman. I used to drive
these roads all the time.

163
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:16,838
Drag, it's going to be
one hot mother today.

164
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:21,134
Yeah, I reckon the bear's going
to be walking the road today.

165
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:23,383
Then I'm lucky I got me a broom.

166
00:14:23,477 --> 00:14:28,056
I work on top, real cush job. I would
hate to be down in that ditch today.

167
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:29,643
We work in a ditch?

168
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:32,230
What's the matter with you?

169
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:36,068
All your big-time driving around,
you ain't never seen a chain gang before?

170
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:39,572
I ain't used to hard work, neither.
I always tried to avoid it.

171
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:42,193
I ain't exactly crazy about it, myself.

172
00:14:42,454 --> 00:14:45,574
Well, man, it's going to be
one tough day to learn on.

173
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:50,080
Now, Koko, why don't you give
one of these new-meat a break...

174
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:51,831
and let him use your broom today?

175
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:55,256
Oh, hell, Society,
I ain't going down in that ditch.

176
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:58,711
Well, I sure would appreciate it.
I ain't in too good a shape right now.

177
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:01,473
Hey, Koko, you really
going to sell your job?

178
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:03,301
Well, Drag, I may have to.

179
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:06,393
Maybe that Lucas War Hero
would give you your price.

180
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:08,471
I'll give you 50 cents.

181
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:12,893
50 cents for a sweet job like that?
That's worth at least a buck.

182
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:14,230
I'll make it a dollar.

183
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,695
Dollar's a deal.

184
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:22,198
Where'd you get that about "war hero"?

185
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,195
A little birdie told me.

186
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,203
Tearing the heads off of... What was it?

187
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,784
Gumball machines?

188
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,990
What kind of thing is that
for a grown man?

189
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:36,421
You know how it is. Small town.
Not much to do in the evening.

190
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:40,716
Mostly, was just settling an old score.

191
00:15:56,987 --> 00:15:59,657
Boss, I made this arrangement
with this man to take his broom.

192
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,020
Get to work.

193
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:07,614
- You don't understand, I made this deal.
- Get moving.

194
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:09,657
But I made this arrangement.

195
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,540
Get to work.

196
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:37,850
Better take it easy.
You won't last two hours.

197
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,698
Taking it off here, Boss?

198
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:44,740
Yeah, Dragline, take it off there.

199
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:48,030
- Taking it off here, Boss?
- Yeah, take it off there.

200
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:50,664
Drinking it up here, Boss?

201
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:07,886
Man bear-clawed here, Boss!

202
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,070
All right, men.

203
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,868
Let's eat them beans!

204
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:51,931
Cold drink he don't make it.

205
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:55,224
You on.

206
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:57,390
Hey, Babalugats, got a bet here.

207
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:25,833
- Boss, drinking it up here?
- All right.

208
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:32,137
Who's that?

209
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:34,428
That's Godfrey.

210
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:36,472
The walking boss.

211
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:50,737
Don't he ever talk?

212
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,164
Think he just said something.

213
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:35,861
You owe that fella a cold drink.

214
00:19:51,597 --> 00:19:52,711
All right!

215
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:55,381
You, Gibson, step out.

216
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:59,682
Boss Paul says you wasn't
happy with your job.

217
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:02,060
That you was complaining.

218
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:05,066
Well, we're going to give you
a chance to think about it.

219
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:06,314
All right.

220
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:07,778
Let's go.

221
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:18,074
Get them clothes off.

222
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:17,594
First bell.

223
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:25,227
Plumb busted out. Look like the hard road
finally got to Mr. Lucas War Hero.

224
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,813
I'll be back at it in the morning.
Just need a little nap.

225
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:31,816
Man, I never thought they'd put him
in the box on his first day.

226
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:34,064
It was only supposed to be a joke.

227
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:36,534
There ain't no brooms.

228
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:39,703
Well, can't expect to learn everything
the first day.

229
00:21:40,414 --> 00:21:42,987
May have taught him
a very valuable lesson.

230
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:47,588
You guys sure give him all night
to think about it.

231
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:50,707
We can't help it if he's square. Huh, Drag?

232
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,128
Of course not. He ain't in the box
because of the joke played on him.

233
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:58,051
He back-sassed a free man.

234
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:02,050
They got their rules and we ain't got
nothing to do with that.

235
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:06,220
Probably happen to him sooner
or later anyway, complainer like him.

236
00:22:06,565 --> 00:22:09,768
He's gotta learn the rules,
same as anybody else.

237
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,278
Yeah, them poor old bosses need
all the help they can get.

238
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:16,691
You trying to say something?

239
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:23,911
Last bell!

240
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:26,291
Last bell!

241
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:30,081
One of these days I'm gonna have to
flap me up some dust with it.

242
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:32,211
Forty-nine and one in the box, Boss.

243
00:22:32,424 --> 00:22:35,875
Right, Carr, 49 and one in the box.

244
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:10,285
Putting them on here, Boss?

245
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:13,381
You see that, you see that?

246
00:23:13,465 --> 00:23:14,793
I got eyes, don't I?

247
00:23:14,883 --> 00:23:18,169
How am I not going to see something
that look like that?

248
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:24,088
Man, oh, man, look at that. Look at that!

249
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:34,980
- Wiping it off here, Boss?
- Wipe it off.

250
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:46,412
- Taking them off here, Boss?
- All right, take it off.

251
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:48,740
Damn things is blocking the scenery.

252
00:23:51,962 --> 00:23:55,128
Oh, man, I'm dying. I'm dying!

253
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:04,009
Nice broad.

254
00:24:06,393 --> 00:24:08,053
Great set.

255
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:19,530
Lucille, baby.

256
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:32,915
Oh, man, I'm dying! I'm dying!

257
00:24:36,423 --> 00:24:40,255
She ain't got nothing but one safety pin
holding that thing on!

258
00:24:42,262 --> 00:24:44,753
Come on, safety pin, pop!

259
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:49,435
Come on, baby, pop!

260
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:53,684
Hey, Lord...

261
00:24:53,774 --> 00:24:57,818
whatever I done, don't strike me blind
for another couple of minutes.

262
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:01,023
My Lucille.

263
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:06,027
Your Lucille, boy. Where did you get that?

264
00:25:06,286 --> 00:25:08,195
That's Lucille, you mullet-head.

265
00:25:08,288 --> 00:25:11,739
Anything so innocent, and built like that...

266
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,873
just gotta be named Lucille.

267
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:18,661
Rub it, baby. Clean that car.

268
00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:20,749
Rub, rub...

269
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,488
She doesn't know what she's doing.

270
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:55,573
Oh, boy, she knows exactly
what she's doing.

271
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:58,788
She's driving us crazy,
and loving every minute of it!

272
00:25:59,172 --> 00:26:01,924
Shut your mouth about my Lucille.

273
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:18,396
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

274
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:21,188
<i>And on his farm he had a pig</i>

275
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:30,316
Will you shut up, Babalugats?

276
00:26:30,412 --> 00:26:32,036
Why don't you leave him alone?
He's happy.

277
00:26:32,122 --> 00:26:33,320
Because he's a damn moron!

278
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:35,621
Why don't you shut your mouth?

279
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:29,083
- Getting up here, Carr?
- Okay, now.

280
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:34,593
- Getting up, Carr?
- Yeah.

281
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:42,023
Getting up here, Carr?

282
00:27:42,108 --> 00:27:44,979
No. Go up.

283
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,837
Oh, man, that little Lucille.

284
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:10,796
She was really a big lot of little gal,
wasn't she?

285
00:28:13,056 --> 00:28:17,184
Did you see how she was just about
popping out of the top of that dress?

286
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:19,477
Come on, Drag, cut it out.

287
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,724
And down below...

288
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:25,483
man, that thing didn't reach
no higher than...

289
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:32,233
She's liable to catch cold
running around like that.

290
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:36,990
It was stretched so tight
across her bottom...

291
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,742
I do believe I saw one of them seams
bust loose.

292
00:28:42,544 --> 00:28:44,536
And the opening got wider...

293
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:49,586
and wider and wider.

294
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:50,956
Forget it, man.

295
00:28:52,887 --> 00:28:54,880
What do you mean, "forget it"?

296
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,886
Stop beating it into the ground.
You ain't doing nobody no good.

297
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:04,732
Okay, new-meat. You get some sleep.

298
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:09,276
And save your strength,
'cause you're going to need it.

299
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:12,728
Tomorrow.

300
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:48,606
Hit him! Hit him!

301
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:07,874
Hey, go get him.

302
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:10,038
- Nice shot, Drag.
- Stay away from him.

303
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:15,464
He's still got a chance.

304
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:26,848
It's a big one.

305
00:30:33,905 --> 00:30:35,483
Come on, Lucas!

306
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,119
Why don't you just stay down, Luke?

307
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,119
He's just going to knock you down again,
buddy.

308
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:51,121
It's not your fault. He's just too big.

309
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:53,456
Let him hit you in the nose
and get some blood flowing.

310
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,626
Maybe the bosses will stop it
before he kills you.

311
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:57,213
I don't want to frighten him.

312
00:30:57,303 --> 00:30:58,846
Stay down, Luke.

313
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:05,009
Stay down, Luke. He's gonna kill you.

314
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:48,425
Stay down!

315
00:32:06,456 --> 00:32:08,947
Somebody ought to stop this thing.

316
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:51,827
Stay down.

317
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,871
You're beat!

318
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:57,502
You're going to have to kill me.

319
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,119
All right, pot's right. Here we go.

320
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:13,949
King gets a three, queen, deuce,
seven, pair of savannahs right here.

321
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:17,493
Deuce gets a four. No help.
Three gets a big ace.

322
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:18,785
Bet to the savannahs.

323
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,208
Pewter.

324
00:34:23,468 --> 00:34:24,713
I call.

325
00:34:36,147 --> 00:34:37,345
Kick a buck.

326
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,018
A dollar?

327
00:34:41,736 --> 00:34:43,645
One time.

328
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:45,649
All right, I call.

329
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:49,069
Hell, if I catch, I'm gonna burn you. I call.

330
00:34:49,243 --> 00:34:52,197
King, three, you got a four,
queen, deuce, gets a five...

331
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,032
and a pair of sevens gets a john.

332
00:34:54,123 --> 00:34:57,788
And the big ace gets... slop in the face.

333
00:34:58,753 --> 00:35:00,959
Okay, you still do the talking.

334
00:35:01,964 --> 00:35:03,163
Pewter again.

335
00:35:03,674 --> 00:35:04,837
I call.

336
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:09,506
Kick a buck.

337
00:35:11,974 --> 00:35:13,682
- What you got?
- Pair of sevens.

338
00:35:13,768 --> 00:35:17,137
I can see that, mullet-head.
What have you got in the hole?

339
00:35:19,273 --> 00:35:21,599
He ain't got nothing showing.
Raise his head off.

340
00:35:21,692 --> 00:35:22,807
He's been betting...

341
00:35:22,902 --> 00:35:25,060
All right, then you just call it.

342
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:26,901
I call.

343
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:29,065
You've got to see it, Gambler.

344
00:35:29,158 --> 00:35:31,198
I can't. I can't catch a damn thing...

345
00:35:31,285 --> 00:35:34,239
I'm snake-bit. I can't catch. I fold.

346
00:35:34,872 --> 00:35:38,787
King, four, three. You got a nine.
Nothing visible.

347
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:41,754
Pair of sevens and a jack gets a six.

348
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,044
Savannas, you is still a better man.

349
00:35:45,925 --> 00:35:47,384
Pewter.

350
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,837
Kick a buck.

351
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:54,884
Kick him back a buck!

352
00:35:54,976 --> 00:35:57,549
I'll see your buck and back a buck.

353
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:00,803
Kick a buck.

354
00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:02,013
Damn!

355
00:36:02,108 --> 00:36:03,650
Don't look at me, mullet-head.

356
00:36:05,486 --> 00:36:06,565
Come on.

357
00:36:06,654 --> 00:36:10,153
What're you going to do,
play like a coconut? You got to call him.

358
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:13,408
I know he's got a pair of kings.
You don't have to stuff them up my nose.

359
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:15,202
Well, you still got to call him, anyway.

360
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:17,245
You gotta look at them.

361
00:36:17,331 --> 00:36:19,822
The man's got kings. Get your tail out.

362
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:28,380
You want to see them? Right there.
One, two, three, four, five.

363
00:36:31,846 --> 00:36:34,088
Nothing. A handful of nothing.

364
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:36,933
You stupid mullet-head,
he beat you with nothing.

365
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:41,146
Just like today when he kept
coming back at me... with nothing.

366
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:48,852
Sometimes nothing
can be a real cool hand.

367
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:53,189
Move over.

368
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:56,192
I'm going to sit in here, next to my boy.

369
00:36:58,372 --> 00:37:00,080
Cool Hand Luke.

370
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:04,745
Deal.

371
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,753
I'm in this next one.

372
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:26,097
Hey, Loudmouth!

373
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:30,110
Come on, get out there.
Your mama's waiting for you.

374
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:34,198
She never leaves me alone!

375
00:37:34,742 --> 00:37:36,735
Be glad you got somebody, kid.

376
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:39,366
Luke, visitor for you.

377
00:37:52,593 --> 00:37:54,752
- Son.
- Come on, Ma.

378
00:37:54,845 --> 00:37:57,419
<i>Just a closer walk with Thee</i>

379
00:38:00,393 --> 00:38:05,304
<i>Grant it, Jesus, is my plea</i>

380
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:13,484
<i>Daily walkin' close to Thee</i>

381
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:16,564
- Coming out here, Boss?
- Come on out, Luke.

382
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:20,401
<i>Let it be, dear Lord</i>

383
00:38:20,496 --> 00:38:22,868
<i>Let it be</i>

384
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:30,953
<i>Through the days of toil that's near</i>

385
00:38:32,967 --> 00:38:38,127
<i>If I fall, dear Lord, who cares?</i>

386
00:38:42,143 --> 00:38:47,303
<i>Who but Thee my burden shares?</i>

387
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:53,107
<i>None but Thee, dear Lord</i>

388
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:55,769
<i>None but Thee</i>

389
00:39:08,169 --> 00:39:09,580
How did you find me?

390
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,624
That Helen...

391
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:15,206
she sent your things along with a note...

392
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:19,381
and then John here,
he wrote to the police.

393
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,517
Move around here, Boss?

394
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:32,933
Well, Arletta, I've got to stay here.

395
00:39:36,614 --> 00:39:39,021
I always hoped to see you well-fixed...

396
00:39:39,992 --> 00:39:43,657
have me a crop of grandkids
to fuss around with.

397
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:47,448
I'd like to oblige you, Arletta, but...

398
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:50,958
right off, I just don't know
where to put my hands on them.

399
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,464
You know, sometimes...

400
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,969
I wish people was like dogs, Luke.

401
00:40:01,472 --> 00:40:04,923
Comes a time, a day like, when...

402
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:10,062
the bitch just don't recognize
the pups no more, so...

403
00:40:11,482 --> 00:40:16,274
she don't have no hopes,
nor love, to give her pain.

404
00:40:19,073 --> 00:40:20,900
She just don't give a damn.

405
00:40:25,996 --> 00:40:27,788
They letting you smoke here?

406
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:29,617
Smoking up here, Boss?

407
00:40:38,008 --> 00:40:40,048
You've done your best, Arletta.

408
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:45,257
What I've done with myself
is my own problem.

409
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:49,181
Oh, no, it ain't, Luke. You ain't alone.

410
00:40:49,729 --> 00:40:52,054
Everywhere you go, I'm with you.

411
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:54,560
And John, too.

412
00:40:57,361 --> 00:40:59,935
You never thought maybe
that's a heavy load?

413
00:41:02,074 --> 00:41:06,238
Why, we always thought you
were strong enough to carry it.

414
00:41:08,247 --> 00:41:09,575
Was we wrong?

415
00:41:09,832 --> 00:41:11,077
I don't know.

416
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:15,253
Well, things are just never the way...

417
00:41:15,337 --> 00:41:16,713
they seem, Arletta, you know that.

418
00:41:16,797 --> 00:41:18,624
A man's gotta go his own way.

419
00:41:18,716 --> 00:41:20,507
Guess, I've just got to...

420
00:41:22,094 --> 00:41:24,217
got to love you and let go.

421
00:41:26,515 --> 00:41:27,796
I guess.

422
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:34,310
I ain't asking what you're going to do
when you get out, because...

423
00:41:34,398 --> 00:41:36,438
I'll be dead and it don't matter.

424
00:41:40,571 --> 00:41:42,445
You never did want to live forever.

425
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:44,987
I mean, it wasn't such a hell of a life.

426
00:41:45,785 --> 00:41:49,236
I had me some high old times.

427
00:41:49,914 --> 00:41:51,538
Your old man, Luke...

428
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:55,119
he wasn't much good
for sticking around...

429
00:41:55,211 --> 00:41:57,915
but, damn it, he made me laugh.

430
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:04,751
I would have liked to have known him,
the way you talk about him.

431
00:42:15,189 --> 00:42:17,098
He'd have broke you up.

432
00:42:30,204 --> 00:42:32,113
- Luke?
- Yeah, Mamma?

433
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:35,661
What went wrong?

434
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:38,705
- Nothing. Everything's cool as can be.
- No.

435
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,000
Arletta, I tried.

436
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:45,499
I mean, to...

437
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:50,341
live always free and above board
like you, but...

438
00:42:50,975 --> 00:42:54,308
I don't know, I just can't seem
to find no elbow room.

439
00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:00,724
You always had good jobs.

440
00:43:01,902 --> 00:43:04,987
And that girl in Kentucky...

441
00:43:05,072 --> 00:43:08,904
Oh. I'd taken a shine to her.

442
00:43:08,993 --> 00:43:12,611
She sure took off
with that convertible fella.

443
00:43:12,705 --> 00:43:14,247
Well, why not?

444
00:43:15,165 --> 00:43:19,958
Idea of marrying got you all,
all bollixed up.

445
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,298
Trying to be respectable.

446
00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:29,089
You was boring the hell out of all of us.

447
00:43:38,856 --> 00:43:40,516
I'm leaving the place to John.

448
00:43:40,608 --> 00:43:42,434
That's good. He earned it.

449
00:43:42,776 --> 00:43:44,686
Ain't nothing to do with it.

450
00:43:48,115 --> 00:43:49,942
I just never give John...

451
00:43:52,202 --> 00:43:55,120
the kind of, you know,
feeling that I give you.

452
00:43:55,205 --> 00:43:59,037
So, I'm going to pay him back now.

453
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:03,499
Don't feel you have to say anything.

454
00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:08,959
The way it is, you see...

455
00:44:14,183 --> 00:44:18,809
sometimes you just
have a feeling for a child...

456
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:22,309
or else you don't.

457
00:44:23,817 --> 00:44:25,810
With John, I just didn't.

458
00:44:32,242 --> 00:44:33,785
I gotta go, Arletta.

459
00:44:35,746 --> 00:44:38,581
Laugh it up, kid. You, you'll make out.

460
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:52,882
Uncle Luke, why can't you have chains?

461
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:56,674
John-Boy, let me tell you something.

462
00:44:56,767 --> 00:45:00,599
You know, them chains ain't medals.
You get them for making mistakes.

463
00:45:01,397 --> 00:45:05,441
And you make a bad enough mistake,
then you've got to deal with the Man.

464
00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:07,317
He is one rough old boy.

465
00:45:07,528 --> 00:45:08,690
Okay?

466
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:24,202
So long, Arletta. Take care.

467
00:45:24,878 --> 00:45:26,289
You know it, kid.

468
00:45:30,843 --> 00:45:33,381
Now there ain't nothing to come back for.

469
00:45:39,977 --> 00:45:45,137
<i>Just a closer walk with Thee</i>

470
00:45:48,152 --> 00:45:53,312
<i>Grant it, Jesus, is my plea</i>

471
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,320
<i>Daily walking close to Thee</i>

472
00:46:04,126 --> 00:46:08,076
<i>Let it be, dear Lord</i>

473
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:12,121
<i>Let it be</i>

474
00:46:13,302 --> 00:46:18,462
<i>Through the days of toil that's near</i>

475
00:46:20,642 --> 00:46:25,803
<i>If I fall, dear Lord, who cares?</i>

476
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:32,183
<i>Who but Thee</i>

477
00:46:32,279 --> 00:46:36,656
<i>My burden shares?</i>

478
00:46:36,742 --> 00:46:40,656
<i>None but Thee, dear Lord</i>

479
00:46:40,746 --> 00:46:44,957
<i>None but Thee</i>

480
00:47:05,312 --> 00:47:06,806
All right.

481
00:47:08,524 --> 00:47:10,682
This gang's been doing so good...

482
00:47:12,069 --> 00:47:15,153
the Captain decided
to give you something special.

483
00:47:16,865 --> 00:47:20,317
You've got yourselves
a whole road of tarring to do.

484
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:24,572
And I want to see you roll it.

485
00:47:30,337 --> 00:47:31,915
Pick up your shovels.

486
00:47:32,422 --> 00:47:34,082
Get with it. Move!

487
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:39,670
The bear's sure going to be walking
the road today.

488
00:47:39,763 --> 00:47:41,008
What's the deal?

489
00:47:41,098 --> 00:47:45,511
Man, you think you been working hard?
This mother's going to break your back.

490
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,885
Let's roll! Let's see those shovels!

491
00:48:30,856 --> 00:48:32,813
All right, roll it!

492
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,562
I'm gonna twist my arm off
if this heat don't kill me first. Right, Boss.

493
00:48:45,746 --> 00:48:48,118
Hey, buddy, slow down.

494
00:48:48,665 --> 00:48:50,373
That's a long road.

495
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:56,120
Well, the Man wants speed,
let's just give it to him.

496
00:48:56,506 --> 00:49:00,635
Cram it in and break it off. Go hard.

497
00:49:02,387 --> 00:49:04,131
What are we racing for?

498
00:49:05,182 --> 00:49:08,183
Wants speed, let's give it to him.

499
00:49:08,769 --> 00:49:11,935
Use that shovel like it was your spoon.
Shag it, man.

500
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:27,911
The Man, boy, get the Man!

501
00:49:28,038 --> 00:49:30,031
Moving it up here, Boss?

502
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:11,783
Now you tell me, Rabbitt,
what's going on here?

503
00:50:12,165 --> 00:50:15,534
I don't know, Boss.
I think they're all bear-clawed.

504
00:50:22,342 --> 00:50:25,094
They don't know whether to smile,
spit, or swallow.

505
00:50:25,178 --> 00:50:28,630
Well, they've never seen
a bull gang before.

506
00:51:43,757 --> 00:51:45,299
Where'd the road go?

507
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:49,010
That's it. That's the end of it.

508
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:51,338
Man, there's still daylight.

509
00:51:51,598 --> 00:51:53,176
About two hours left.

510
00:51:54,935 --> 00:51:56,393
What do we do now?

511
00:51:57,771 --> 00:51:58,934
Nothing.

512
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:03,438
Oh, Luke, you wild, beautiful thing!

513
00:52:04,277 --> 00:52:06,603
You crazy handful of nothing!

514
00:52:27,717 --> 00:52:30,090
"As Carol pressed her lips to him...

515
00:52:30,178 --> 00:52:34,472
"his right hand started a slow
descent down her silken body.

516
00:52:35,308 --> 00:52:38,927
"Desire and fear, temptation and terror...

517
00:52:39,354 --> 00:52:43,518
"yearning and horror warred
within her beautiful young body."

518
00:52:45,861 --> 00:52:47,770
They have to close those things,
or we'll drown...

519
00:52:47,863 --> 00:52:50,567
but it sure is suffocating in here.

520
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:52,533
Talk about drowning.

521
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:55,035
When I was in the Navy...

522
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,074
I was on submarine duty once,
and when you get down there...

523
00:52:58,165 --> 00:53:01,450
Will you tell your story walking?
It's too hot.

524
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:13,753
Did you see my skinny little boy
chow tonight?

525
00:53:13,847 --> 00:53:16,005
He's matching you plate for plate.

526
00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:19,552
I wasn't feeling good.
I think I got an ulcer or something.

527
00:53:20,687 --> 00:53:23,854
He had a bigger spoon.
Made you look like yours had a hole in it.

528
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,221
Come on, Clarence.

529
00:53:25,317 --> 00:53:27,855
What do you mean, "Clarence"?
You calling me a liar?

530
00:53:27,944 --> 00:53:29,107
No, not a liar.

531
00:53:29,196 --> 00:53:33,110
You just have a common and
likeable tendency toward exaggeration.

532
00:53:35,702 --> 00:53:38,869
That there's the champion hog-gutter
of this camp.

533
00:53:39,706 --> 00:53:42,244
Hell, I've seen him eat
ten chocolate bars...

534
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:45,169
and seven cold drinks in 15 minutes.

535
00:53:46,213 --> 00:53:50,460
He can eat busted bottles and rusty nails,
any damn thing.

536
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:54,714
If you be so kind to let me cut off
your Yankee head, he'll even eat that.

537
00:53:56,223 --> 00:53:57,681
I can eat 50 eggs.

538
00:54:02,562 --> 00:54:04,140
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

539
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:05,808
You just said he could eat anything.

540
00:54:05,899 --> 00:54:07,144
You ever eat 50 eggs?

541
00:54:07,234 --> 00:54:09,310
Nobody ever ate 50 eggs.

542
00:54:09,402 --> 00:54:11,644
Hey, Babalugats! We got a bet here.

543
00:54:11,988 --> 00:54:14,906
My boy says he can eat 50 eggs,
he can eat 50 eggs.

544
00:54:14,991 --> 00:54:16,616
Yeah, but in how long?

545
00:54:17,786 --> 00:54:18,984
In an hour.

546
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:21,321
Well, I believe I'll take part of that wager.

547
00:54:21,414 --> 00:54:22,743
$2. Right here. I'm going to Koko.

548
00:54:22,832 --> 00:54:24,375
Come on now, let's talk some money.

549
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:26,368
All right, $20. Anything.

550
00:54:26,461 --> 00:54:28,786
The syndicate will cover any kind of bet
you want to make.

551
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,959
Koko, get some paper.

552
00:54:30,048 --> 00:54:33,499
Drag, 50 eggs got to weigh
a good 6 pounds.

553
00:54:33,593 --> 00:54:36,428
Man's gut can't hold that.
They'll swell up and bust him open.

554
00:54:36,513 --> 00:54:37,544
You gonna kill him.

555
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:40,593
All right, get your money up. Now,
Gambler, Dynamite, come on, get it up.

556
00:54:40,684 --> 00:54:43,803
Coconut-head's going to take all the
money. Come on, Loudmouth, get it up.

557
00:54:43,895 --> 00:54:45,722
Wait just a minute, now.
How's he gonna eat them?

558
00:54:45,814 --> 00:54:48,352
Boiled for 15 minutes.
Eat the whole thing in an hour.

559
00:54:48,441 --> 00:54:50,897
One rule. No throwing up.

560
00:54:50,986 --> 00:54:53,477
He throws up, you forfeit everything.

561
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,698
Now when was the last time
you ever saw my boy throw up?

562
00:54:56,783 --> 00:54:59,321
Now shut your mouth
and give your money to Koko.

563
00:54:59,411 --> 00:55:02,162
Come on, now. Right over here.

564
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:08,158
Luke, what did you have to say 50 for?

565
00:55:08,461 --> 00:55:11,830
Why couldn't you say 35 or 39?

566
00:55:11,923 --> 00:55:13,916
It seemed a nice round number.

567
00:55:14,134 --> 00:55:17,669
That's money you're talking about.
What's the matter with you?

568
00:55:17,804 --> 00:55:21,173
Yeah, well, it'll be something to do.

569
00:55:26,938 --> 00:55:29,097
- Ten!
- Ten, right!

570
00:55:32,777 --> 00:55:34,272
What did I do?

571
00:55:36,323 --> 00:55:38,481
I stole and I told lies.

572
00:55:39,284 --> 00:55:40,564
Keep your left up.

573
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,827
- But I love my neighbor.
- And his wife.

574
00:55:44,164 --> 00:55:45,907
He'll never make it.

575
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,405
Wait a second.

576
00:55:48,501 --> 00:55:52,250
What we've got to do is stretch
that little old belly of yours.

577
00:55:52,339 --> 00:55:53,418
Do it, man.

578
00:55:53,506 --> 00:55:56,875
Get all this stuff out of the way
of them eggs coming down.

579
00:55:56,968 --> 00:55:58,166
What do you think?

580
00:55:59,012 --> 00:56:02,760
We've got to get it all in fighting shape,
like a barrage balloon.

581
00:56:07,103 --> 00:56:08,681
Ready?

582
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,474
And go!

583
00:56:21,368 --> 00:56:25,235
Hey, Boss, man needs a brown bomber
and a dose of salts.

584
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,737
Nobody said nothing about that.

585
00:56:32,337 --> 00:56:33,879
You can't do that!

586
00:56:36,383 --> 00:56:39,253
- I want my money back.
- No money back.

587
00:56:50,271 --> 00:56:52,976
Twenty of those pills still won't
make any difference. Go ahead.

588
00:56:53,066 --> 00:56:55,023
What are you worried about?
He can't do it.

589
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,272
Do we get our money?

590
00:56:56,361 --> 00:56:57,855
What's he doing?

591
00:57:33,732 --> 00:57:35,808
Here comes his eggs.

592
00:57:36,443 --> 00:57:39,728
All right, stand back, you pedestrians.
This ain't no automobile accident.

593
00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:40,900
Is that all 50 of them?

594
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:43,740
Move over, losers.
I got money riding on it.

595
00:57:45,744 --> 00:57:47,024
All right, I've got it figured out.

596
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,536
If he eats an egg a minute,
he's got 10 minutes left to swallow them.

597
00:57:50,623 --> 00:57:53,577
Hey, I was just sent $5 from a rodeo outfit.

598
00:57:53,668 --> 00:57:55,661
- What for? Well, you gonna bet it?
- Last bull I fell off of.

599
00:57:55,754 --> 00:57:58,873
- Hey, you're peeling his eggs!
- That's right, Mr. Alibi.

600
00:57:58,965 --> 00:58:01,337
He peels his eggs himself.
That's understood.

601
00:58:01,426 --> 00:58:04,178
Now you may be just great
at hanging paper around the big city...

602
00:58:04,262 --> 00:58:05,507
and passing bad checks...

603
00:58:05,597 --> 00:58:07,839
but us country boys
ain't entirely brainless.

604
00:58:07,932 --> 00:58:10,933
When it comes to the law,
nothing is understood.

605
00:58:11,144 --> 00:58:13,433
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

606
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:16,439
Who made what law
about peeling the eggs?

607
00:58:16,524 --> 00:58:19,691
I'm his trainer.
I'm the syndicate covering all bets.

608
00:58:19,778 --> 00:58:22,613
And I'm his official egg-peeler.
That's the law.

609
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,949
Just wait till the hour starts, that's all.

610
00:58:30,038 --> 00:58:32,244
I was banking on the fact
that he had to peel them.

611
00:58:32,332 --> 00:58:33,577
First it was the salt...

612
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:35,876
What's going on?

613
00:58:40,882 --> 00:58:42,257
All right.

614
00:58:45,637 --> 00:58:47,047
You ready, champ?

615
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:53,681
Ready?

616
00:58:55,438 --> 00:58:56,601
Go!

617
00:58:57,732 --> 00:58:58,763
One...

618
00:59:00,068 --> 00:59:01,230
two...

619
00:59:01,736 --> 00:59:03,065
three...

620
00:59:03,154 --> 00:59:06,321
Man, he's going to lose a finger
eating eggs like that.

621
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:15,946
Twenty-four...

622
00:59:21,714 --> 00:59:22,794
twenty-five...

623
00:59:22,882 --> 00:59:24,376
Slow down a little.

624
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,174
Twenty-six...

625
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:35,060
Forget it, he's wasting time.

626
00:59:35,144 --> 00:59:37,636
What's the exercise,
is that part of the rules?

627
00:59:38,523 --> 00:59:40,562
You better forget about it.

628
00:59:53,705 --> 00:59:54,867
Thirty-two.

629
00:59:59,752 --> 01:00:01,875
Still got 18 more to go...

630
01:00:02,005 --> 01:00:03,084
What's wrong?

631
01:00:03,172 --> 01:00:05,046
- I think he's gonna throw up!
- Oh, no.

632
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:06,757
- That's it.
- He's finished.

633
01:00:06,843 --> 01:00:08,670
- Come on, Luke!
- Eighteen to go.

634
01:00:08,761 --> 01:00:09,793
Hey, you'll feel better.

635
01:00:10,847 --> 01:00:12,092
He's finished.

636
01:00:21,566 --> 01:00:24,436
Just like a ripe watermelon
that's about to bust itself open.

637
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:27,196
Your boy's done for, Drag.
I'm putting in my last penny.

638
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,815
- It don't look good, Drag.
- Man's gut can't hold more than that.

639
01:00:40,585 --> 01:00:44,333
- He's all right, he's all right.
- He's going to make himself sick.

640
01:00:49,594 --> 01:00:52,132
- He's all right.
- Attaboy.

641
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:58,183
I give you a dollar, he don't eat all 50 eggs,
I get $2 back.

642
01:00:58,269 --> 01:01:00,262
Fixer, you is a sweet old boy.

643
01:01:00,605 --> 01:01:04,223
You better take that dollar and buy
yourself a new spark plug or something.

644
01:01:04,317 --> 01:01:06,855
But as long as you done took a stand...

645
01:01:06,945 --> 01:01:10,111
why don't you put some money where
your mouth is and not no measly buck!

646
01:01:10,198 --> 01:01:11,906
Well, all I got is $3.75, Drag.

647
01:01:11,991 --> 01:01:13,272
That's a bet, Koko.

648
01:01:13,368 --> 01:01:16,819
All right, now, the rest of you,
I want to hear from some big-money men.

649
01:01:16,913 --> 01:01:18,537
Where's all the high rollers?

650
01:01:18,623 --> 01:01:22,952
I believe you've got it all, Dragline.
Every cent in camp is riding.

651
01:01:33,429 --> 01:01:34,971
Thirty-three.

652
01:01:36,516 --> 01:01:38,592
- What's the time?
- Come on, baby.

653
01:01:39,018 --> 01:01:41,426
Twenty-four minutes to go.

654
01:01:41,813 --> 01:01:45,810
Just let that little old belly sag
and enjoy itself.

655
01:01:46,693 --> 01:01:48,151
Thirty-nine.

656
01:01:48,444 --> 01:01:50,236
Going down into the cage.

657
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:53,315
Twenty-four minutes. He'll never make it.

658
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:00,027
Forty-one.

659
01:02:00,331 --> 01:02:05,040
Stay loose, buddy. Just nine more
between you and everlasting glory.

660
01:02:05,128 --> 01:02:06,326
Is he eating them, Alibi?

661
01:02:06,421 --> 01:02:09,125
He's chewing. Look at that.

662
01:02:09,215 --> 01:02:12,299
They're pigeon eggs, that's all.
Fish eggs, practically.

663
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:13,790
How much more time, Carr?

664
01:02:13,886 --> 01:02:15,678
Six minutes to go, Stevie.

665
01:02:16,764 --> 01:02:18,342
Chew, chew, chew!

666
01:02:18,433 --> 01:02:19,547
You're helping him chew now!

667
01:02:19,642 --> 01:02:21,267
I'm not.

668
01:02:23,229 --> 01:02:25,554
- Forty-two.
- He's not spitting them out.

669
01:02:26,899 --> 01:02:28,773
Tiny, tiny egg.

670
01:02:34,866 --> 01:02:36,360
Two minutes to time!

671
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:46,115
Forty-four.

672
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:49,377
All right, now,
get mad at them damned eggs.

673
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:50,787
Eat them down, boy.

674
01:02:50,882 --> 01:02:51,913
Chew on it.

675
01:02:52,008 --> 01:02:53,170
Gnaw on it.

676
01:02:59,015 --> 01:03:00,295
Thirty seconds.

677
01:03:01,017 --> 01:03:02,511
You got the last one.

678
01:03:02,602 --> 01:03:05,472
Stuff it down in there. Get it in.

679
01:03:05,563 --> 01:03:09,264
That's the last one in there now, baby.
Chew. Chew.

680
01:03:09,442 --> 01:03:11,435
He's got to swallow it all
before the time's up.

681
01:03:11,527 --> 01:03:14,731
Ten, nine, eight...

682
01:03:14,822 --> 01:03:17,823
seven, six, five...

683
01:03:18,451 --> 01:03:21,368
four, three, two...

684
01:03:21,454 --> 01:03:23,826
one, zero!

685
01:03:26,584 --> 01:03:28,956
Hold it! He didn't swallow the last.

686
01:03:29,045 --> 01:03:32,295
You think so? Just take a look here.

687
01:03:32,381 --> 01:03:33,876
Open that mouth.

688
01:03:50,108 --> 01:03:52,100
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

689
01:04:11,212 --> 01:04:13,169
Snake in the grass here, Boss!

690
01:04:13,256 --> 01:04:14,666
Get it.

691
01:04:14,757 --> 01:04:16,038
Get it!

692
01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:22,466
Pick it up here, Boss?

693
01:04:32,817 --> 01:04:33,932
Hey, Boss?

694
01:04:34,652 --> 01:04:36,395
Forgot your walking stick.

695
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:50,374
Man, you sure can shoot.

696
01:04:58,509 --> 01:05:01,759
You've gone too far when
you mess with the Man With No Eyes.

697
01:05:01,846 --> 01:05:03,221
You'll be out of here in a little bit.

698
01:05:03,306 --> 01:05:05,547
Why don't you take it a little easy?

699
01:05:25,203 --> 01:05:27,907
All right, everybody in the trucks.

700
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:39,464
Boy, look at him go! Bam! Bam!

701
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:43,548
Just knock it off, Luke!
You can't talk about him that way.

702
01:05:44,222 --> 01:05:46,428
You still believe in
that big bearded boss up there?

703
01:05:46,515 --> 01:05:47,760
You think he's watching us?

704
01:05:47,892 --> 01:05:49,220
Get in here!

705
01:05:49,602 --> 01:05:51,061
Aren't you scared?

706
01:05:52,063 --> 01:05:53,687
Aren't you scared of dying?

707
01:05:53,773 --> 01:05:56,857
Dying? Boy, he can have this
little life anytime he wants to.

708
01:05:56,943 --> 01:05:58,852
You hear that? You hear it?

709
01:05:59,904 --> 01:06:03,273
Come on! You're welcome to it, old timer.

710
01:06:03,908 --> 01:06:05,699
Let me know you're up there. Come on.

711
01:06:05,785 --> 01:06:09,070
Love me, hate me, kill me, anything.
Just let me know it.

712
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:15,660
Just standing in the rain...

713
01:06:16,212 --> 01:06:17,208
talking to myself.

714
01:06:22,635 --> 01:06:26,549
Blind Dick is paying back three
and borrowing five.

715
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:27,754
Next.

716
01:06:27,932 --> 01:06:29,177
You borrowing or paying back?

717
01:06:29,267 --> 01:06:30,677
Borrowing.

718
01:06:30,768 --> 01:06:34,517
Well, Mr. Cool Hand here is the soft heart
in our loan department.

719
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:36,939
I just need five, Luke.

720
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:42,184
I knew you could really eat all them eggs.

721
01:06:42,488 --> 01:06:44,066
Yeah, well, I didn't.

722
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:50,285
That's my darling Luke.
He grins like a baby...

723
01:06:50,955 --> 01:06:53,362
but he bites like a gator. Next.

724
01:06:53,457 --> 01:06:54,952
I believe I still owe the 30.

725
01:06:55,042 --> 01:06:57,664
I don't suppose you'd care to take a check?

726
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:02,121
Luke.

727
01:07:05,636 --> 01:07:06,834
Sorry.

728
01:07:26,324 --> 01:07:27,782
His mother's dead.

729
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:23,995
<i>I don't care if it rains or freezes</i>

730
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:28,383
<i>As long as I got my plastic Jesus</i>

731
01:08:28,469 --> 01:08:33,047
<i>Sitting on the dashboard of my car</i>

732
01:08:36,894 --> 01:08:41,058
<i>Comes in colors pink and pleasant</i>

733
01:08:41,148 --> 01:08:44,813
<i>Glows in the dark 'cause it's iridescent</i>

734
01:08:45,403 --> 01:08:47,894
<i>Take it with you</i>

735
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,075
<i>When you travel far</i>

736
01:08:55,246 --> 01:08:59,326
<i>Get yourself a sweet Madonna</i>

737
01:08:59,417 --> 01:09:02,916
<i>Dressed in rhinestone sitting on</i>

738
01:09:03,754 --> 01:09:08,712
<i>A pedestal of abalone shell</i>

739
01:09:11,262 --> 01:09:15,722
<i>Going 90, I ain't scary</i>

740
01:09:15,808 --> 01:09:19,675
<i>'Cause I got the Virgin Mary</i>

741
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,763
<i>Assuring me</i>

742
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,275
<i>That I won't go to hell</i>

743
01:09:31,949 --> 01:09:34,903
<i>Get yourself a sweet Madonna</i>

744
01:09:34,994 --> 01:09:37,995
<i>Dressed in rhinestone sitting on</i>

745
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,991
<i>A pedestal of abalone shell</i>

746
01:09:44,462 --> 01:09:47,297
<i>Going 90, I ain't scary</i>

747
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:50,002
<i>'Cause I got the Virgin Mary</i>

748
01:09:50,092 --> 01:09:51,551
<i>Assuring me</i>

749
01:09:51,635 --> 01:09:54,885
<i>That I won't go to hell</i>

750
01:10:14,992 --> 01:10:16,320
Luke, fall out.

751
01:10:25,878 --> 01:10:28,583
When a man's mother dies...

752
01:10:28,672 --> 01:10:32,966
and he gets to thinking about
her funeral and paying respects...

753
01:10:33,511 --> 01:10:36,844
before he knows it, his mind ain't right.

754
01:10:37,806 --> 01:10:40,476
He's got rabbit in his blood and he runs.

755
01:10:41,685 --> 01:10:44,307
We're keeping you off the road for a while.

756
01:10:51,195 --> 01:10:53,816
I'm going to say a prayer
for your ma, Luke.

757
01:11:34,405 --> 01:11:38,948
Sorry, Luke, I'm just doing my job.
You've got to appreciate that.

758
01:11:41,245 --> 01:11:43,950
Calling it your job
don't make it right, Boss.

759
01:11:53,757 --> 01:11:55,216
Twenty-one.

760
01:11:55,676 --> 01:11:56,839
- Twenty-two.
- Twenty-three.

761
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,920
- Twenty-four.
- Twenty-five.

762
01:11:59,179 --> 01:12:02,216
- Twenty-six.
- Twenty-seven.

763
01:12:02,308 --> 01:12:04,181
- Twenty-eight.
- Twenty-nine.

764
01:12:04,268 --> 01:12:05,892
- Thirty.
- Thirty-one.

765
01:12:08,606 --> 01:12:12,140
- Moving it up here, Boss?
- Move it up.

766
01:12:37,551 --> 01:12:38,796
Four.

767
01:12:39,637 --> 01:12:40,668
Five.

768
01:12:42,056 --> 01:12:43,466
- Six.
- Seven.

769
01:12:43,557 --> 01:12:44,968
- Eight.
- Nine.

770
01:12:45,893 --> 01:12:47,007
- Ten.
- Eleven.

771
01:12:47,102 --> 01:12:48,561
- Twelve.
- Thirteen.

772
01:13:05,162 --> 01:13:08,246
Your ma's in the ground now,
God rest her soul.

773
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:11,706
You best forget about it, Luke.

774
01:13:12,503 --> 01:13:15,836
Got a day and a half lay-in.
Tomorrow's a holiday.

775
01:14:08,392 --> 01:14:11,097
- Happy Fourth of July!
- Same to you!

776
01:14:56,482 --> 01:14:59,981
Break it up. Come on, you had your fun.

777
01:15:00,068 --> 01:15:02,986
First bell! Move it, Stevie.

778
01:15:03,947 --> 01:15:06,438
Hey, Carr. Come here.

779
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:11,026
What have you got,
another one of them dirty books, Drag?

780
01:15:11,121 --> 01:15:14,953
Do yourself a favor. Read this part
that Koko underlined for me.

781
01:15:17,795 --> 01:15:21,128
"She moved her head another inch
while he reached up...

782
01:15:22,132 --> 01:15:24,837
"and put his left hand on Carol's...

783
01:15:25,636 --> 01:15:27,961
"As Carol pressed her..."

784
01:15:28,055 --> 01:15:30,047
Oh, I can't stand it!

785
01:15:32,142 --> 01:15:34,633
You're just coming to
the interesting part now.

786
01:15:34,728 --> 01:15:36,270
Yeah, go ahead.

787
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:50,864
- I can't hear you.
- "Her trembling body...

788
01:15:50,953 --> 01:15:53,989
"shivered under his..."

789
01:15:54,706 --> 01:15:56,995
All right!

790
01:15:57,668 --> 01:16:00,503
Last bell. Last bell.

791
01:16:02,714 --> 01:16:04,541
- Move it.
- Hey, Carr.

792
01:16:05,008 --> 01:16:06,800
What's that noise outside?

793
01:16:10,889 --> 01:16:12,597
Man on the fence, Boss!

794
01:16:18,272 --> 01:16:20,015
Hit him!

795
01:16:25,237 --> 01:16:26,945
Wait a minute! Damn it!

796
01:16:27,072 --> 01:16:29,645
Blue, come back here! Damn it!

797
01:16:34,663 --> 01:16:37,997
Forty-eight, Boss.
One in the box and one in the bush.

798
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:41,458
Forty-eight. One in the box
and one in the bush.

799
01:17:04,902 --> 01:17:06,728
Oh, listen to Blue sing!

800
01:17:07,905 --> 01:17:11,487
He's onto him, he says. He's got him.

801
01:17:11,575 --> 01:17:13,532
Hell, that dog's running around in circles.

802
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:15,077
No, he's onto him.

803
01:17:15,495 --> 01:17:18,615
Captain says for us to wait
till the patrol gets here.

804
01:17:18,707 --> 01:17:20,498
Should've waited for me to get him out.

805
01:17:20,584 --> 01:17:22,576
Loose like that he can run him crazy.

806
01:17:22,669 --> 01:17:25,836
Didn't even have enough sense
to run from the road like everybody else.

807
01:17:25,923 --> 01:17:28,710
Oh, I'm beat. This ain't my job nohow.

808
01:18:28,151 --> 01:18:29,943
Your dogs are crazy.

809
01:18:30,028 --> 01:18:31,570
He's crossed it.

810
01:18:31,655 --> 01:18:34,609
He's smarter than I thought. Let's go!

811
01:21:12,691 --> 01:21:14,066
He made it!

812
01:21:16,611 --> 01:21:17,809
Look, Captain!

813
01:21:18,947 --> 01:21:20,738
Look what he done to Blue.

814
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:23,065
He's dead.

815
01:21:26,246 --> 01:21:28,239
He run himself plumb to death.

816
01:21:57,861 --> 01:21:59,652
Mr. Hunnicutt.

817
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:04,649
Get in line facing the Captain.

818
01:22:48,411 --> 01:22:52,326
You're going to get used to wearing
them chains after a while, Luke...

819
01:22:52,415 --> 01:22:55,452
but you'll never stop listening
to them clinking.

820
01:22:56,544 --> 01:23:00,044
'Cause they're going to remind you
of what I've been saying...

821
01:23:01,216 --> 01:23:02,793
for your own good.

822
01:23:03,426 --> 01:23:06,096
Wish you'd stop being so good
to me, Captain.

823
01:23:10,016 --> 01:23:12,721
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

824
01:23:13,478 --> 01:23:14,641
Never!

825
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:16,058
Never!

826
01:23:23,029 --> 01:23:25,699
What we've got here is...

827
01:23:26,574 --> 01:23:29,030
failure to communicate.

828
01:23:29,911 --> 01:23:33,446
Some men you just can't reach.

829
01:23:34,082 --> 01:23:38,744
So you get what we had here last week,
which is the way he wants it.

830
01:23:39,254 --> 01:23:40,962
Well, he gets it.

831
01:23:43,591 --> 01:23:47,292
I don't like it anymore than you men.

832
01:23:56,146 --> 01:23:58,518
Well, lookie here.

833
01:23:59,482 --> 01:24:01,107
I knew they'd get you.

834
01:24:01,484 --> 01:24:03,442
Them chains and a bonus
of a couple of years...

835
01:24:03,528 --> 01:24:06,363
Your running days are over forever, boy.

836
01:24:06,906 --> 01:24:09,528
Hell, I'd like to see you try to run again.

837
01:24:10,118 --> 01:24:13,867
You know, you getting so you smell
so bad, I can track you myself.

838
01:24:15,498 --> 01:24:18,914
Yeah, well, that ought to be easy
for a genuine son of a bitch.

839
01:24:31,306 --> 01:24:32,930
Tell us what happened.
How far did you get?

840
01:24:33,016 --> 01:24:34,724
Shut up and let him eat.

841
01:24:35,143 --> 01:24:36,851
About a mile and a half.

842
01:24:39,647 --> 01:24:41,058
This supermarket parking lot.

843
01:24:41,149 --> 01:24:43,391
Found a car with keys in the ignition.

844
01:24:43,485 --> 01:24:46,854
Hit this red light and this police car
slides up alongside.

845
01:24:49,532 --> 01:24:51,110
Then what did you do?

846
01:24:51,826 --> 01:24:53,902
Waited for that light to change.

847
01:24:55,038 --> 01:24:58,241
This cop kept looking over, wondering
what somebody that looks like me...

848
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:01,916
dressed in state issue,
was doing driving a shiny new buggy.

849
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,707
So what did he do?

850
01:25:06,049 --> 01:25:08,718
He leaned over and said, "Hey!"

851
01:25:09,844 --> 01:25:12,170
Topflight police work,
that's all there is to it.

852
01:25:12,263 --> 01:25:14,589
Fella's probably a lieutenant by now.

853
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:24,560
Now, we're just gonna lay low
and build time.

854
01:25:24,943 --> 01:25:27,694
Before you know it,
the heat's going to be off of you.

855
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:31,397
Everything will be right back where it was.
Right, sweet buddy?

856
01:25:44,087 --> 01:25:46,792
I hear tell you don't believe
in no God, Luke.

857
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:50,675
I was wondering how come a nice,
clean-cut young fellow like you...

858
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,967
gets to be put on the hard road.

859
01:25:54,097 --> 01:25:55,674
Now I reckon I knows.

860
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:01,050
I've been on the road gang
almost 22 years.

861
01:26:01,771 --> 01:26:04,856
In all that time,
I ain't never killed no white man...

862
01:26:05,733 --> 01:26:07,810
but I ain't afraid to because...

863
01:26:07,902 --> 01:26:11,022
Excuse me, Boss, don't mean to interrupt.
Caught short here.

864
01:26:11,114 --> 01:26:13,237
It's all right. It's okay.

865
01:26:13,908 --> 01:26:16,482
You just go on out there
behind them trees.

866
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:19,402
A man's gotta have his privacy sometime.

867
01:26:19,998 --> 01:26:23,283
You just keep shaking that bush
so we know you're there.

868
01:26:23,376 --> 01:26:25,369
Just keep shaking that bush.

869
01:26:25,628 --> 01:26:27,004
Yes, Boss.

870
01:26:53,656 --> 01:26:56,112
Shaking it up here, Boss!

871
01:26:59,162 --> 01:27:01,154
Still shaking it, Boss.

872
01:27:04,459 --> 01:27:06,167
I'm shaking it, Boss.

873
01:27:27,649 --> 01:27:28,847
Damn!

874
01:27:30,318 --> 01:27:32,061
He's gone. Get the dogs.

875
01:28:31,629 --> 01:28:33,337
What you got them on for?

876
01:28:33,423 --> 01:28:35,665
How do you take your pants off?

877
01:28:36,801 --> 01:28:39,553
Best way is to get rid of them leg irons...

878
01:28:40,555 --> 01:28:41,800
but you ain't strong enough.

879
01:28:41,889 --> 01:28:43,597
Strong enough for what?

880
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,102
Hell, you couldn't heft an axe.

881
01:28:47,186 --> 01:28:48,467
Can, too.

882
01:28:48,563 --> 01:28:49,642
- I bet you can't.
- Can, too.

883
01:28:49,731 --> 01:28:51,474
- Bet you can't.
- Can, too.

884
01:28:53,901 --> 01:28:56,108
Well, then go get it, man.

885
01:29:02,243 --> 01:29:03,406
What's your name, boy?

886
01:29:03,494 --> 01:29:04,526
Ben.

887
01:29:05,913 --> 01:29:09,033
Aren't you going to take
those stripes off your pants?

888
01:29:09,792 --> 01:29:11,203
You know it, kid.

889
01:29:26,059 --> 01:29:28,182
- You want to see something real funny?
- Yeah?

890
01:29:28,269 --> 01:29:30,428
Well, you go on in there and you get me...

891
01:29:30,521 --> 01:29:33,855
chili powder, pepper, curry and the like.
A lot of it, all right?

892
01:29:52,794 --> 01:29:55,119
You'd better let me handle that, son.

893
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:29,407
Here they are.

894
01:30:30,123 --> 01:30:31,237
Thank you, son.

895
01:30:31,332 --> 01:30:33,159
What's the matter with him?

896
01:30:33,334 --> 01:30:34,828
He'll be all right.

897
01:30:39,507 --> 01:30:41,215
Hey, boy.

898
01:30:41,509 --> 01:30:44,296
Now listen. You're going to have
some fun. You hear that?

899
01:30:44,387 --> 01:30:47,139
Well, you remember how them dogs do
when they come through here...

900
01:30:47,223 --> 01:30:49,892
so you can tell me
about it someday, okay?

901
01:32:04,425 --> 01:32:06,797
My wife hasn't written me for a month.

902
01:32:09,263 --> 01:32:11,090
She's probably sick again.

903
01:32:15,895 --> 01:32:17,140
Drag...

904
01:32:17,897 --> 01:32:19,688
magazine for you.

905
01:32:21,943 --> 01:32:23,900
- Carr, you got anything?
- Magazines.

906
01:32:23,986 --> 01:32:27,106
Hey, Koko, who's sending me magazines?

907
01:32:29,826 --> 01:32:31,533
Don't know. It's from Atlanta.

908
01:32:31,619 --> 01:32:32,947
My uncle!

909
01:32:33,454 --> 01:32:37,452
Ain't heard from him in eight years
and now he's sending me magazines!

910
01:32:38,292 --> 01:32:39,952
He must have gone crazy!

911
01:32:44,799 --> 01:32:46,044
Look at that!

912
01:32:46,175 --> 01:32:48,583
- That's Luke?
- Look at that, two of them.

913
01:32:51,305 --> 01:32:53,013
What's the writing say?

914
01:32:53,641 --> 01:32:55,550
What's that writing say?

915
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:59,094
"Dear boys: Playing it cool. Luke."

916
01:32:59,814 --> 01:33:01,356
Let me take a look. Come here.

917
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,018
Hey, pass it around.

918
01:33:05,236 --> 01:33:07,229
They must be 6 feet tall.

919
01:33:11,242 --> 01:33:12,701
Give it back there.

920
01:33:14,161 --> 01:33:15,490
Look at that!

921
01:33:15,663 --> 01:33:17,821
My baby! We're in here
digging and dying...

922
01:33:17,915 --> 01:33:20,371
he's out there living and flying.

923
01:33:48,654 --> 01:33:50,398
Koko, will you stop that?

924
01:33:51,032 --> 01:33:52,941
Why don't you try making me?

925
01:34:04,253 --> 01:34:07,954
- Hey, Drag? Let me see the picture.
- What for?

926
01:34:08,049 --> 01:34:10,125
Come on, Drag, let us see the picture.

927
01:34:10,217 --> 01:34:12,294
No, you're just a kid.
What you know about it?

928
01:34:12,386 --> 01:34:14,794
You don't want to see that dirty picture.

929
01:34:14,889 --> 01:34:17,344
Luke and them broads and all that booze.

930
01:34:17,433 --> 01:34:18,548
Come on, let me take a look.

931
01:34:18,643 --> 01:34:21,216
It would go to your coconut head.
You're liable to get ideas...

932
01:34:21,312 --> 01:34:22,391
and pass right out.

933
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,808
Come on, Drag, be a buddy.

934
01:34:23,898 --> 01:34:27,231
Now, what you figure it's worth?
A peek at that there picture?

935
01:34:27,318 --> 01:34:29,809
A quick look now.
I'm not talking about no memorizing job.

936
01:34:29,904 --> 01:34:31,066
Cold drink.

937
01:34:31,405 --> 01:34:33,647
A cold... One cold drink...

938
01:34:33,741 --> 01:34:37,240
to feast your starving, fishy,
little eyes on the picture?

939
01:34:37,411 --> 01:34:39,618
A true vision of paradise itself...

940
01:34:39,705 --> 01:34:43,454
with two of the angels right there
frisking around with my boy?

941
01:34:44,794 --> 01:34:46,288
Okay, it's a deal.

942
01:34:46,379 --> 01:34:48,502
One cold drink, in advance.

943
01:35:03,104 --> 01:35:05,013
One chilly bottle
right in my hot little hand.

944
01:35:05,106 --> 01:35:07,941
That goes for the rest
of you mullet-heads, too.

945
01:35:08,401 --> 01:35:09,776
Let me see.

946
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,271
Did you pay?

947
01:35:15,282 --> 01:35:17,240
Coming in there, Wickerman.

948
01:35:45,813 --> 01:35:49,811
You run one time,
you get yourself a set of chains.

949
01:35:50,401 --> 01:35:53,355
You run twice, you get yourself two sets.

950
01:35:53,988 --> 01:35:55,779
You ain't going to need no third set...

951
01:35:55,865 --> 01:35:58,616
because you're going to get
your mind right.

952
01:35:59,201 --> 01:36:01,360
And I mean "right."

953
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,073
Take a good look at Luke.

954
01:36:07,501 --> 01:36:08,782
Cool Hand Luke.

955
01:36:18,471 --> 01:36:20,380
- Easy, easy!
- Let him breathe!

956
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:25,175
Oh, my poor baby.
They done you real good.

957
01:36:25,269 --> 01:36:27,677
I don't know if you're going
to have them girls chasing you.

958
01:36:27,772 --> 01:36:28,970
I'll get some aspirin.

959
01:36:29,065 --> 01:36:31,223
- He should have a doctor.
- Ain't you ever gonna learn?

960
01:36:31,317 --> 01:36:33,356
They ain't gonna let no doctor see
what they've done.

961
01:36:33,444 --> 01:36:34,819
Some ice should take that swelling down.

962
01:36:34,904 --> 01:36:38,107
Get your razor. We'll clean up
some of these cuts on his head.

963
01:36:38,199 --> 01:36:40,440
How you feeling, buddy? How you feeling?

964
01:36:40,534 --> 01:36:42,029
Maybe he can't hear you.

965
01:36:42,119 --> 01:36:44,871
Somebody ought to give him
something cold to drink.

966
01:36:44,955 --> 01:36:47,826
- That's my baby.
- Now he's going to be all right.

967
01:36:49,210 --> 01:36:52,579
Hey, Luke, look, we got the picture
you sent us. Look there.

968
01:36:57,176 --> 01:36:59,382
You really can pick them, Luke.

969
01:36:59,470 --> 01:37:02,139
Come on, tell us. What were they like?

970
01:37:02,223 --> 01:37:04,096
Can't you wait until he stops bleeding?

971
01:37:04,183 --> 01:37:06,970
- Why don't you go back to your knitting?
- Knock it off, you guys.

972
01:37:07,061 --> 01:37:09,303
Picture's a phony. Cost me a week's pay.

973
01:37:09,396 --> 01:37:10,974
What do you mean, a phony?

974
01:37:11,065 --> 01:37:12,144
What you talking about, man?

975
01:37:12,233 --> 01:37:14,688
We see them two women
right here in the picture.

976
01:37:14,777 --> 01:37:16,983
Did you have them both at once?
I mean, together?

977
01:37:17,071 --> 01:37:20,404
Picture's a phony.
I had it made up for you guys.

978
01:37:20,533 --> 01:37:22,821
What do you mean? We saw it all!

979
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:24,073
You was having a big time, man.

980
01:37:24,161 --> 01:37:25,324
You had it made!

981
01:37:25,412 --> 01:37:27,904
Nothing. Made nothing, had nothing.

982
01:37:28,457 --> 01:37:30,616
Couple of towns, couple of bosses.

983
01:37:31,085 --> 01:37:33,492
I laughed out loud once, he turned me in.

984
01:37:33,587 --> 01:37:34,619
But I got it here!

985
01:37:34,713 --> 01:37:38,663
Oh, come on! Stop beating it!

986
01:37:39,593 --> 01:37:41,301
Get out there yourselves!

987
01:37:42,596 --> 01:37:46,297
Stop feeding off me! Get out of here!

988
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,759
Can't breathe. Give me some air!

989
01:37:55,442 --> 01:37:57,400
Well, he ain't himself, can't you see that?

990
01:37:57,486 --> 01:38:00,404
He's all beat up.
He don't know what he's saying.

991
01:38:01,615 --> 01:38:03,857
All right, come on, break it up.

992
01:38:03,993 --> 01:38:05,403
Now, straighten out that bench.

993
01:38:27,975 --> 01:38:29,434
You was eyeballing.

994
01:38:29,518 --> 01:38:32,638
Can't get your mind on them weeds
if you're eyeballing.

995
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:35,399
You don't need reasons to kick me, Boss.

996
01:38:40,487 --> 01:38:43,607
First bell. Move it.

997
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,902
He'll never make it.

998
01:38:49,997 --> 01:38:51,824
What are you talking about?

999
01:39:02,927 --> 01:39:06,794
That old box will collapse and fall apart
before Luke calls it quits.

1000
01:39:06,889 --> 01:39:09,095
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.

1001
01:39:09,183 --> 01:39:11,341
Well, I don't see no sign of guts in you.

1002
01:39:11,435 --> 01:39:14,270
No. No chains, either.

1003
01:39:14,355 --> 01:39:16,643
Big deal paperhanger,
passing two-bit checks.

1004
01:39:16,732 --> 01:39:20,267
You haven't had much luck playing
follow-the-leader, have you?

1005
01:39:21,987 --> 01:39:25,605
All right! Last bell!

1006
01:39:26,033 --> 01:39:28,654
You want to spend the night
in the box, too?

1007
01:39:32,998 --> 01:39:37,292
Well, here's our champion hog-gut.
Ain't ate for four days.

1008
01:39:37,378 --> 01:39:40,497
You're going to need a little extra.
Got plenty for you.

1009
01:39:40,589 --> 01:39:41,870
Now you know the rules.

1010
01:39:41,966 --> 01:39:44,457
Got to clean your plate
or go back in the box. Right, Boss?

1011
01:39:44,551 --> 01:39:45,796
That's enough, Dog Boy.

1012
01:39:45,886 --> 01:39:48,045
Oh, man used to free-world food
has got a big appetite.

1013
01:39:48,138 --> 01:39:51,092
We're going to stretch that
hog-belly right out, huh?

1014
01:41:08,594 --> 01:41:09,625
One.

1015
01:41:10,929 --> 01:41:12,589
- Two.
- Three.

1016
01:41:12,681 --> 01:41:14,757
- Four.
- Five.

1017
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:16,392
- Six.
- Seven.

1018
01:41:16,477 --> 01:41:18,600
Well, you made the week, boy.

1019
01:41:19,313 --> 01:41:22,764
Now you got a day-and-a-half
to rest up for old Monday.

1020
01:41:23,233 --> 01:41:24,396
Luke!

1021
01:41:52,346 --> 01:41:54,837
That ditch is Boss Keen's ditch.

1022
01:41:55,516 --> 01:41:58,007
I told him that dirt in it is your dirt.

1023
01:41:58,685 --> 01:42:00,927
What's your dirt doing in his ditch?

1024
01:42:02,189 --> 01:42:03,683
I don't know, Boss.

1025
01:42:04,525 --> 01:42:07,194
You better get in there and get it out, boy.

1026
01:42:22,543 --> 01:42:24,452
<i>Well, you wake up in the morning</i>

1027
01:42:24,545 --> 01:42:26,786
<i>Hear the ding dong ring</i>

1028
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,588
<i>You go a-marching to the table</i>

1029
01:42:28,882 --> 01:42:30,958
<i>See the same damn thing</i>

1030
01:42:31,051 --> 01:42:32,843
<i>Well, it's on the table</i>

1031
01:42:33,095 --> 01:42:35,301
<i>A knife, a fork and a pan</i>

1032
01:42:35,389 --> 01:42:37,013
<i>Say anything about it</i>

1033
01:42:37,266 --> 01:42:39,342
<i>You get in trouble with the man</i>

1034
01:42:39,435 --> 01:42:41,308
<i>You get in trouble with the man</i>

1035
01:42:41,395 --> 01:42:43,186
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

1036
01:42:43,689 --> 01:42:45,480
<i>Shine a light on me</i>

1037
01:42:45,732 --> 01:42:47,606
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

1038
01:42:47,776 --> 01:42:50,446
<i>Shine her ever-loving light on me</i>

1039
01:42:51,738 --> 01:42:53,530
<i>If you ever go to Houston</i>

1040
01:42:53,907 --> 01:42:55,318
<i>Boy, you better walk right</i>

1041
01:42:55,409 --> 01:42:57,947
<i>And you better not stagger</i>

1042
01:42:58,036 --> 01:43:00,076
<i>And you better not fight</i>

1043
01:43:00,164 --> 01:43:02,489
<i>'Cause the sheriff's gonna arrest you</i>

1044
01:43:02,583 --> 01:43:04,908
Luke, what do you think you're doing?

1045
01:43:07,254 --> 01:43:10,290
Just getting my dirt
out of Boss Keen's ditch, Boss.

1046
01:43:10,424 --> 01:43:13,508
I'll be damned if you're going
to put your dirt in my yard.

1047
01:43:13,594 --> 01:43:15,420
You hear me?

1048
01:43:15,512 --> 01:43:17,469
Now let's get it out of there.

1049
01:43:19,016 --> 01:43:21,092
<i>If you ever go to Houston</i>

1050
01:43:21,185 --> 01:43:23,224
<i>Boy, you better walk right</i>

1051
01:43:23,312 --> 01:43:25,185
<i>And you better not stagger</i>

1052
01:43:25,272 --> 01:43:27,478
<i>And you better not fight</i>

1053
01:43:27,566 --> 01:43:29,226
<i>'Cause the sheriff's gonna arrest you</i>

1054
01:43:29,318 --> 01:43:31,310
<i>They're gonna take you down</i>

1055
01:43:31,403 --> 01:43:33,526
<i>Say anything about it</i>

1056
01:43:33,614 --> 01:43:35,855
<i>You're penitentiary-bound</i>

1057
01:43:35,949 --> 01:43:37,693
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

1058
01:43:37,784 --> 01:43:39,777
<i>Shine a light on me</i>

1059
01:44:00,474 --> 01:44:04,057
I told you to get your dirt out
of Boss Keen's ditch, didn't I?

1060
01:44:07,564 --> 01:44:08,727
Yeah, Boss.

1061
01:44:09,024 --> 01:44:10,933
Then how come it ain't out?

1062
01:44:17,491 --> 01:44:19,318
I don't know, Boss.

1063
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:21,320
You don't know.

1064
01:44:44,851 --> 01:44:46,678
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1065
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:50,104
<i>Gonna keep my body down</i>

1066
01:44:50,857 --> 01:44:53,183
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1067
01:44:53,527 --> 01:44:56,528
<i>Gonna hold my body down</i>

1068
01:44:58,865 --> 01:45:02,946
<i>Keep your mind on me above</i>

1069
01:45:03,036 --> 01:45:06,370
<i>Keep your heart full of love</i>

1070
01:45:06,999 --> 01:45:09,537
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1071
01:45:09,626 --> 01:45:13,126
<i>Gonna hold my body down</i>

1072
01:45:14,006 --> 01:45:16,378
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1073
01:45:16,466 --> 01:45:19,633
<i>Gonna hold my body down</i>

1074
01:45:51,918 --> 01:45:54,125
What's all this dirt doing in here?

1075
01:46:01,136 --> 01:46:03,129
I don't know.

1076
01:46:14,107 --> 01:46:16,314
<i>When I was a little bitty baby</i>

1077
01:46:16,401 --> 01:46:19,023
<i>My mamma used to rock me in my cradle</i>

1078
01:46:19,112 --> 01:46:22,612
<i>In them old cotton fields back home</i>

1079
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:25,692
<i>It was down in Louisiana</i>

1080
01:46:25,786 --> 01:46:27,244
Don't, Boss.

1081
01:46:27,329 --> 01:46:28,704
Get to work.

1082
01:46:29,623 --> 01:46:31,865
Don't, Boss. Don't hit me anymore.

1083
01:46:34,795 --> 01:46:37,167
For God's sake, don't hit me anymore.

1084
01:46:37,464 --> 01:46:41,758
What was that you said?
What was that name you used, Luke?

1085
01:46:43,261 --> 01:46:44,542
Oh, God!

1086
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:47,920
Oh, God!

1087
01:46:53,146 --> 01:46:56,017
Oh, God, I pray to God
you don't hit me anymore.

1088
01:46:58,985 --> 01:47:02,319
I'll do anything you say,
but I can't take anymore.

1089
01:47:03,115 --> 01:47:06,069
- You got your mind right, Luke?
- Yeah...

1090
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:09,829
I got it right.

1091
01:47:13,041 --> 01:47:15,248
Oh, I got it right, Boss.

1092
01:47:23,009 --> 01:47:25,002
Suppose you was to backslide on us?

1093
01:47:25,095 --> 01:47:27,088
Oh, no, I won't, Boss.

1094
01:47:27,848 --> 01:47:30,006
Suppose you was to back-sass?

1095
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:33,102
Oh, no, I won't. I won't.
I got my mind right.

1096
01:47:41,361 --> 01:47:43,769
You try to run again,
we're going to kill you.

1097
01:47:43,864 --> 01:47:45,572
I won't, I won't, Boss.

1098
01:47:52,038 --> 01:47:56,368
Go get cleaned up and get yourself
some sleep. Suspect you need it.

1099
01:47:58,879 --> 01:48:00,207
Come on, son.

1100
01:48:02,048 --> 01:48:03,756
Come on up out of there.

1101
01:48:38,251 --> 01:48:40,327
Coming in, Boss.

1102
01:49:07,113 --> 01:49:08,656
I got my mind right.

1103
01:49:44,818 --> 01:49:46,063
Where are you?

1104
01:49:47,821 --> 01:49:49,529
Where are you now?

1105
01:50:36,536 --> 01:50:40,486
- All right. Smoke it up.
- Yes, sir.

1106
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,538
Luke, water them down.

1107
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:46,951
Yes, Boss.

1108
01:51:09,069 --> 01:51:11,061
Luke! Fetch the rifle.

1109
01:52:01,413 --> 01:52:03,489
You got him, Boss. You got him.

1110
01:52:03,957 --> 01:52:05,416
Go fetch it, Luke.

1111
01:52:25,979 --> 01:52:29,099
There he is, Boss.
Deader than hell, but won't let go.

1112
01:52:39,325 --> 01:52:41,947
You cut that up for our lunch, Luke.

1113
01:52:42,912 --> 01:52:44,739
Yes, sir, Boss Paul.

1114
01:53:31,211 --> 01:53:33,702
He took the keys off of Dog Boy's truck.

1115
01:53:34,839 --> 01:53:36,666
He got the keys here, too.

1116
01:53:52,899 --> 01:53:56,066
"I'm shaking it here, Boss. I'm shaking it."

1117
01:54:02,242 --> 01:54:03,902
That's my baby, Luke.

1118
01:54:07,413 --> 01:54:10,580
"Don't hit me, Boss. Don't hit me.

1119
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:15,416
"I'll do whatever you say.
Only don't hit me."

1120
01:54:15,505 --> 01:54:18,126
You are an original, that's what you are.

1121
01:54:18,216 --> 01:54:20,885
Those mullet-heads didn't even know
you were fooling them.

1122
01:54:22,679 --> 01:54:26,178
Fooling them? You can't fool them
about something like that.

1123
01:54:26,266 --> 01:54:27,511
They broke me.

1124
01:54:28,935 --> 01:54:32,269
But they didn't get my mind right.
Not with no stick. No, sir.

1125
01:54:33,148 --> 01:54:36,232
All that time you were planning
on running again.

1126
01:54:36,526 --> 01:54:39,147
I've never planned anything in my life.

1127
01:55:05,305 --> 01:55:08,389
That's just a little old farm road.
Clean as a whistle.

1128
01:55:08,474 --> 01:55:12,175
I worked it a couple times.
We're home free. Come on.

1129
01:55:12,270 --> 01:55:13,550
We ain't going nowhere.

1130
01:55:13,646 --> 01:55:15,639
Now, what are you talking about, Luke?

1131
01:55:15,732 --> 01:55:18,567
We're going by my house
and we're going to have a big meal.

1132
01:55:18,651 --> 01:55:23,194
Then, I'm going to show you a couple of
farm girls that really knows what fun...

1133
01:55:24,324 --> 01:55:26,233
And then we're going to get Koko
out of there.

1134
01:55:26,326 --> 01:55:28,995
And then the terrible trio
going to be complete again.

1135
01:55:29,078 --> 01:55:32,862
Man, this old free world
ain't going to know which ear to stand on.

1136
01:55:33,416 --> 01:55:36,702
Yeah, well, you and Koko
can handle it without me.

1137
01:55:37,712 --> 01:55:39,705
What you mean, Luke?

1138
01:55:40,173 --> 01:55:42,249
I've done enough world-shaking
for a while.

1139
01:55:42,342 --> 01:55:45,508
You do the rest of it for me.
Send me a postcard about it.

1140
01:55:45,595 --> 01:55:47,588
- But, Luke...
- Take it easy, Drag.

1141
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:49,590
Where are you going?

1142
01:55:49,682 --> 01:55:50,927
Just on my own.

1143
01:55:52,352 --> 01:55:55,269
But what am I going to do, all by myself?

1144
01:55:57,523 --> 01:56:01,272
Man, if I hadn't lost my head.
I only had a couple of years to do.

1145
01:56:02,195 --> 01:56:05,528
But when I saw you tearing down the road
in that truck...

1146
01:56:08,701 --> 01:56:10,445
Well, you're right, Luke.

1147
01:56:11,704 --> 01:56:13,364
We ought to split up.

1148
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:18,536
And then, and then it will be safer
for the both of us.

1149
01:56:23,049 --> 01:56:26,500
Just the same,
you're a good old boy, Luke.

1150
01:56:29,472 --> 01:56:30,800
You take care!

1151
01:56:33,893 --> 01:56:35,553
You hear?

1152
01:57:27,989 --> 01:57:29,317
Anybody here?

1153
01:57:44,839 --> 01:57:46,915
Hey, old man. You home tonight?

1154
01:57:52,096 --> 01:57:55,596
Can you spare a minute?
It's about time we had a little talk.

1155
01:57:59,687 --> 01:58:01,846
I know I'm a pretty evil fellow...

1156
01:58:02,231 --> 01:58:06,063
killed people in the war and got drunk...

1157
01:58:06,402 --> 01:58:08,858
and chewed up municipal property
and the like.

1158
01:58:08,946 --> 01:58:10,939
I know I got no call to ask for much...

1159
01:58:11,032 --> 01:58:15,528
but even so, you've got to admit,
you ain't dealt me no cards in a long time.

1160
01:58:16,788 --> 01:58:20,951
It's beginning to look like you got
things fixed so I can't never win out.

1161
01:58:21,959 --> 01:58:23,999
Inside, outside, all of them...

1162
01:58:24,962 --> 01:58:28,248
rules and regulations and bosses.

1163
01:58:28,341 --> 01:58:30,168
You made me like I am.

1164
01:58:30,676 --> 01:58:33,084
Now just where am I supposed to fit in?

1165
01:58:35,890 --> 01:58:38,725
Old man, I gotta tell you.

1166
01:58:40,436 --> 01:58:42,844
I started out pretty strong and fast...

1167
01:58:47,568 --> 01:58:49,775
but it's beginning to get to me.

1168
01:58:52,031 --> 01:58:53,442
When does it end?

1169
01:58:55,243 --> 01:58:57,282
What do you got in mind for me?

1170
01:58:57,954 --> 01:58:59,448
What do I do now?

1171
01:59:04,085 --> 01:59:05,460
All right.

1172
01:59:14,595 --> 01:59:16,090
On my knees, asking.

1173
01:59:28,776 --> 01:59:30,685
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1174
01:59:32,905 --> 01:59:35,277
I guess I'm pretty tough to deal with, huh?

1175
01:59:36,409 --> 01:59:37,903
A hard case.

1176
01:59:41,456 --> 01:59:43,163
I guess I gotta find my own way.

1177
01:59:56,512 --> 01:59:57,543
Luke!

1178
02:00:08,274 --> 02:00:10,231
Is that your answer, old man?

1179
02:00:12,487 --> 02:00:14,563
I guess you're a hard case, too.

1180
02:00:19,827 --> 02:00:21,820
Luke, you all right?

1181
02:00:23,956 --> 02:00:27,954
They got us, boy. They're out there,
thicker than flies.

1182
02:00:28,336 --> 02:00:30,661
Bosses, dogs, sheriffs...

1183
02:00:30,755 --> 02:00:33,921
more guns than I've ever seen in my life.
You ain't got a chance.

1184
02:00:34,008 --> 02:00:36,760
They caught up with me
right after we split up.

1185
02:00:37,428 --> 02:00:40,927
And they was aiming to kill you.
But I fixed that.

1186
02:00:41,516 --> 02:00:44,682
I got them to promise
if you give up peaceful...

1187
02:00:45,436 --> 02:00:48,188
they ain't even going
to whip you this time.

1188
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:51,812
They're even going to give us
our same bunks back?

1189
02:00:52,652 --> 02:00:54,478
Sure, why not?

1190
02:00:54,570 --> 02:00:58,734
We've only been gone a couple of hours.
They're reasonable men.

1191
02:01:03,329 --> 02:01:04,704
Yeah, well.

1192
02:01:07,875 --> 02:01:09,702
You've got to listen to me.

1193
02:01:11,045 --> 02:01:14,379
All you've got to do is give up...

1194
02:01:14,799 --> 02:01:16,258
nice and quiet.

1195
02:01:17,718 --> 02:01:19,545
Just play it cool.

1196
02:01:22,348 --> 02:01:24,056
Yeah, like I always do?

1197
02:01:24,684 --> 02:01:26,890
Yeah, just play it...

1198
02:01:33,025 --> 02:01:34,685
What're you doing?

1199
02:01:54,839 --> 02:01:58,623
"What we got here
is a failure to communicate."

1200
02:02:42,345 --> 02:02:43,507
Go get him.

1201
02:03:20,466 --> 02:03:23,965
You hang on in there, Luke. You hang on.

1202
02:03:25,888 --> 02:03:28,723
There's going to be
some world-shaking, Luke.

1203
02:03:29,975 --> 02:03:32,182
We're going to send you a postcard.

1204
02:03:33,521 --> 02:03:36,272
You follow me and I'll radio
the emergency clinic to open up.

1205
02:03:36,357 --> 02:03:38,599
I'm taking him to the prison hospital.

1206
02:03:38,693 --> 02:03:40,436
But that's an hour away. He won't make it.

1207
02:03:40,528 --> 02:03:43,101
Get out of the way. He's ours.

1208
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:30,407
They took him right down that road.

1209
02:04:30,536 --> 02:04:33,241
- What'd he look like, Drag?
- Yeah, Drag, what did he look like?

1210
02:04:33,330 --> 02:04:35,489
Did he have his eyes open or closed?

1211
02:04:35,583 --> 02:04:38,121
- He was smiling.
- Smiling?

1212
02:04:39,754 --> 02:04:44,914
<i>That's right. You know,</i>
<i>that Luke smile of his?</i>

1213
02:04:45,134 --> 02:04:47,707
<i>He had it on his face right to the very end.</i>

1214
02:04:47,928 --> 02:04:49,209
<i>Hell, if they didn't know it before...</i>

1215
02:04:49,305 --> 02:04:53,302
<i>they could tell right then</i>
<i>that they weren't ever going to beat him.</i>

1216
02:04:53,768 --> 02:04:55,677
<i>That old Luke smile.</i>

1217
02:04:57,813 --> 02:05:02,890
<i>Oh, Luke. He was some boy.</i>
<i>Cool Hand Luke, hell!</i>

1218
02:05:03,903 --> 02:05:06,228
<i>He's a natural born world-shaker!</i>

1219
02:06:30,739 --> 02:06:31,819
English

1220
