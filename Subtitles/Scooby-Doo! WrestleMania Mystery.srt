Welcome to WWE City.

3
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,715
Take the next exit because
it's just that good.

4
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,617
I'm The Miz, and I'm awesome.

5
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,052
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

6
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,020
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

7
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,789
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

8
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,490
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

9
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,859
Who's awesome? I am... uhh!

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,033
Kane, you're back.

11
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:13,171
I thought we'd never see you again
after you lost that last match.

12
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,177
Not that I agreed with the decision.

13
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,248
Not the face. Not the face.
Not the face.

14
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,985
Welcome to WWE City.

15
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:33,024
Take the next exit because
it's just that good.

16
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,128
Whoa!

17
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,664
Oof!

18
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:47,939
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
You keep on going, Kane.

19
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,075
You're lucky! You got
off easy this time.

20
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,016
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

21
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,685
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

22
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,757
Who's awesome...

23
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,665
Who's in there?
Is that you, Kane?

24
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,235
Come on. Come on out and get some.

25
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,382
Uhh!

26
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,457
Uhh!

27
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,125
That all you got, Yogi?

28
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:46,164
Uhh! Uhh!

29
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,101
My... my face!

30
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:55,473
Welcome to WWE City.

31
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:59,544
Take the next exit because
it's just that good.

32
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,279
Good.

33
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:10,788
Really?

34
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:17,962
Ahh! No! No!

35
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,305
Unnecessary roughness.

36

Animation

37
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:23,654
Look out. John Cena is the
doctor of Thundernomics.

38
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,324
Ha ha ha.

39
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:29,193
He can't see me.

40
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,095
You can't see me at all.

41
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,564
Like, no one can touch John Cena.

42
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,900
Sin Cara can.

43
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:40,037
Scooby Dooby-doo!

44
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:45,276
1, 2, 3.

45
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,845
Sin Cara wins it.

46
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,514
Way to go, Scooby-Doo, old buddy.

47
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,917
Booyah. Dooby-doo.

48
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,186
Congratulations.

49
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,356
You just beat the game on
the hardest level ever...

50
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,360
double triple beatdown extreme.

51
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,529
But can you complete
the victory dance?

52
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,335
Oh, yeah.
It's all yours, pal. You earned it.

53
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:50,541
Perfect score!

54
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,309
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!

55
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:59,016
Hello there. I'm Vince McMahon,
chairman and CEO of WWE.

56
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,719
Mr. McMahon.

57
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,021
We're not worthy.

58
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,023
Because you beat the
game on this level

59
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:10,561
and executed a perfect score on the
victory dance, you win a special prize.

60
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,329
We did?

61
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,666
You've won an all-expense
paid trip to WWE City.

62
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:20,671
Come revel in a place
dedicated to everything WWE.

63
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,274
It'll be a week of
fun and excitement,

64
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:28,312
culminating in ringside seats
at Wrestlemania. Don't miss it.

65
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,981
Report to training camp in WWE City

66
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,452
as soon as possible with this game disc
as proof of your win to claim your prize.

67
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,353
Like, Wrestlemania.
Ha ha ha!

68
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,689
You gotta be kidding me.
Think of it.

69
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,724
The fun.
The fans.

70
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,226
The food!

71
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,096
We gotta go, old pal.
Like, we just gotta go.

72
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:50,801
We gotta go.
Like, we just gotta go.

73
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:55,906
It's the ultimate slamtastic
life-affirming experience of a lifetime.

74
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,441
It's Wrestlemania.

75
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,743
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,980
Uh, I don't know, guys. It's not
something we're really into.

77
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,649
And I have a lot of
reading to catch up on.

78
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,019
Uh, no, thank you.
Like, come on, guys.

79
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,656
Scoob and I never ask for anything.
Like, I can't count how many times

80
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,427
the two of us were bait to catch
some crazy mask-wearing villain.

81
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,695
Yeah.

82
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,030
I got the photos to prove it.

83
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:25,536
Take a good look, people.
Exhibit "A." Like, here's the time

84
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,440
you guys made us dress like giant tools
to catch the monstrous mechanic.

85
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,343
Or as ducks to catch
the horrific huntsman.

86
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:37,381
Or when we had to be the cow to catch the
crazed cowgirl from beyond the grave.

87
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,783
Scooby-Doo almost got milked.

88
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,753
It was so humiliating.

89
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:47,558
And the Piéce De Résistance,

90
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,727
the time we posed
as señor Pepe Jose

91
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,063
and the dancing hairless
Chihuahua Don Pero

92
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,800
to catch the ghastly
Gordito of Guadalajara.

93
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:00,771
Yeah, the hair didn't even
grow back in some places.

94
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,240
Scooby was naked.
Look at him.

95
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,843
Just look at him!
No, no. Ok.

96
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,679
We get it.
You win, Shaggy.

97
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,882
Win? Wait, what?

98
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,818
I was actually thinking
about taking a trip anyway

99
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,089
to try out my new allodium
Q-36 digital SLR camera

100
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,991
and optical stabilizer zoom lens.

101
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,894
Maybe I can snap some
action-packed pictures.

102
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,529
And this will give
me an opportunity

103
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:29,233
to explore the parallels between
the modern world of WWE

104
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,201
vs. Ancient warrior customs.

105
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,004
Besides, it beats another
weekend with grandpa Dinkley

106
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,574
and his mysterious odor problem.

107
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:41,445
Scooby-Doo almost got milked.

108
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,481
The hair didn't even grow back

109
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,850
in some places.

110
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:51,522
Ok, we'll go to Wrestlemania.

111
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,690
Whoo-hoo!

112
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,693
WWE City, here we come.

113
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,128
Oh, boy.

114
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,231
Hee hee hee!

115
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:30,361
Here comes the flying huna
caruna off the top ropes.

116
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,797
Ha ha ha!

117
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,901
And it's countered by Scooby's
patented corkscrew counter crunch.

118
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:42,139
Um, exactly how many more
play-by-play Scooby snack attacks

119
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,608
will we have to endure
before WWE City?

120
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,410
Like, we brought everything we had.

121
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,445
Scooby and I need to
keep our energy up

122
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,448
so we can cheer like
crazy at the main event.

123
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,685
There's so many boxes
I can't even see the luggage.

124
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,088
Luggage?
You didn't pack the luggage?

125
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,289
Ruh-roh.

126
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,825
Of all the food-induced,
insane things

127
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,928
you two have done, this
absolutely takes the cake.

128
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,631
Mmm. Cake.

129
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,334
I mean it.
Like, what's the big deal?

130
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,704
We all wear the same outfits
every single day anyway.

131
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,707
Well, you gotta admit it,
he does have a point.

132
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,976
Hmph.

133
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,411
Hey, look.

134
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:24,915
Like, WWE City, next exit.

135
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:27,818
Hold the phone!

136
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:51,909
Looks like we're stuck.

137
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,977
There's a car coming.

138
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,913
Maybe they can help.

139
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:00,951
Well, now, this ain't a
good place for a breakdown.

140
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:04,121
Can we help you kids out?

141
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,757
John Cena.

142
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,659
Whoa.

143
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:12,162
Ok. Looks like you kids
ran into some trouble.

144
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,165
This ain't safe, champ.
We gotta keep moving.

145
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,967
Calm down, cookie.

146
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,770
I'm just saying that it's
dangerous out here at night,

147
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,739
what with the bear trouble and all.

148
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,607
That's why Ruben,
my nephew here,

149
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,777
and I have been following the
superstars on their jogs.

150
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,680
Hi.

151
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:33,283
Well, these kids aren't going
anywhere while their van is stuck.

152
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,818
This shouldn't take long.

153
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,355
Uh, what's he gonna do,
lift the van out of the ditch?

154
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,508
Scooby! Shaggy!

155
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:07,484
Cool.

156
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,521
I didn't know WWE
superstars were so hot.

157
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,823
Strong! I mean strong.

158
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:21,165
Grr!

159
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:26,904
Scooby, no!

160
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,038
Come back!

161
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,240
Scooby! Scooby!

162
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,376
Scoob, stop!

163
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,986
Aah!

164
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,966
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

165
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,840
Zoinks!

166
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,909
A mo... a mo... monster!

167
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,879
Monster? Where?
Where?

168
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,417
Oh, scoob!
Ha ha ha!

169
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,419
You had me worried, pal.

170
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,287
It's me.
It's you.

171
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,525
Yikes!

172
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,932
What are you two doing in my woods?

173
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,501
Um, leaving.

174
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,737
Cool down a bit, Bayard.

175
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:37,674
The dog and the long haired
fella didn't mean to trespass.

176
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:41,011
They're just fans come for the WWE.

177
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,113
They all come for that.

178
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:47,951
And the more they come, the
hungrier they make the beast.

179
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,553
The beast?

180
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:54,191
The beast called WWE City.

181
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:59,530
Every day it eats up more
and more of our land.

182
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,498
But not for long,

183
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,635
'cause there's a storm a-coming,

184
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:09,273
and we're gonna watch it
blow you all out of here

185
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,977
like dead leaves.

186
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:23,153
Now, get off my property.

187
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,961
Oh, don't let old Bayard spook you.

188
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,230
He's not what you
call a people person.

189
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,132
Still, it's not right.

190
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:39,069
Can I make it up to you by offering you
some VIP seats at our live event tonight?

191
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,005
Would you be interested?
Would we?

192
00:15:57,755 --> 00:16:01,491
Ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:05,595
welcome to WWE.

194
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,197
Uhh!

195
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:53,777
Ahh!

196
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,515
Uhh!

197
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:25,075
Like, pinch me,
I think I'm dreaming.

198
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,209
Ow!

199
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,078
I'm not dreaming.

200
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,049
Boy, what an exciting tag team
match we have here tonight.

201
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,785
The big show and Alberto del Rio

202
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:39,056
are up against sin
Cara and John Cena.

203
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,559
And Cena wastes no time
delivering an elbow to big show.

204
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,761
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

205
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,330
Big show with a chop.

206
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,533
And del Rio blindsides Cena.

207
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:53,070
That was a dirty move.
And I think the ref agrees.

208
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,672
Oh, my goodness, Sin Cara's up.

209
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,675
And he delivers high-flying
justice to del Rio.

210
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,043
Whoo-hoo!
Heh heh heh!

211
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,312
And it looks like the end for Cena.

212
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:05,282
But somehow Cena reverses.
He's got big show up.

213
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,652
Oh, no!
Look out!

214
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:15,092
That was my favorite table.
Del Rio's up.

215
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,795
But he walks right into
Cena's sidewalk slam.

216
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:23,733
And the crowd goes wild.
But wait, big show's back.

217
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,771
With a picnic table?
Where did he get a picnic table?

218
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,606
Oh, the humanity.

219
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,676
I don't see anything in the rules
about the use of furniture.

220
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,711
It's a show, Velma.

221
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,714
It's Sin Cara to the rescue
with a tilt-a-whirl.

222
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,683
And it's a takedown
of the big show.

223
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,151
Oh!

224
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,185
Whoo-hoo!

225
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,720
W!
W!

226
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,856
Best move ever.

227
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,157
Cena gathers his...

228
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,226
Well, I can't say I'm bored.

229
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,095
And here it comes.
You can't see me.

230
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:55,232
Cena's vintage 5 knuckle shuffle.

231
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,803
Let's go, Cena!
Let's go, Cena!

232
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,507
Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Yay!

233
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:08,678
With incredible strength, Cena
takes big show to the top ropes.

234
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,115
An avalanche.
Attitude adjustment.

235
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,250
Into the cover.

236
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,085
1, 2, 3!

237
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,353
It's over!

238
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,822
Cena for the win.

239
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,857
Cena for the win.

240
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,727
Yeah! Yeah, man!

241
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,862
Amazing, dude!

242
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:29,232
Tonight's tag team winners,

243
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:33,771
John Cena and Sin Cara.

244
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,742
Oh, Cena! My gosh,
you're wonderful.

245
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:46,416
Welcome, fans.

246
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:52,589
You should be excited because
I'm about to lay on you

247
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,691
something very heavy...

248
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:59,095
our very own WWE championship belt.

249
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:09,506
Ahh.

250
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,208
Yes, it's solid gold,

251
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,244
encrusted with priceless
gems and jewels,

252
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:18,815
but any WWE superstar will tell
you it's not about the glitter.

253
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,819
The championship belt
represents honor, respect,

254
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,355
hard work, dedication,

255
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,458
the very soul of WWE.

256
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:35,899
As you know, ever since Kane's WWE
championship match was overturned,

257
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,469
this championship belt
has been held vacant.

258
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:43,840
And so it shall remain until
a true champion rises up

259
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,842
and proves themself worthy

260
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:50,714
this weekend in the main
event at Wrestlemania.

261
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:59,456
Did you know that a
golden ceremonial prize

262
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,592
was customary at ancient games
for thousands of years?

263
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,661
No, Velma.
Thank you.

264
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:10,767
Oh, it's a text from John Cena, thanking
me personally for all the cheering.

265
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,102
That's a keeper.

266
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,837
When did you give Cena
your phone number?

267
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,707
Oh, when I gave him my email, my
home address, and my scarf size.

268
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:22,445
Hey, why don't you crazy kids join
us at the training camp tonight?

269
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,381
It's something to see.

270
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,183
WWE training camp?

271
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:42,399
How'd you like sin
Cara's convertible?

272
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,036
Like, it's a real muscle machine.

273
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:56,579
Here we are, guys.

274
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,149
WWE's rock yard,

275
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,285
where the pros train for greatness.

276
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,589
Ahh!

277
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:17,600
Uhh!

278
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:21,971
Look!

279
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,007
It's sergeant slaughter.

280
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,943
Like, Zowie!
There's Jerry "The King" Lawler.

281
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,112
And Jimmy hart.

282
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:34,984
Here at camp, we even have
our own 24-hour restaurant.

283
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,619
It's like home.

284
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,622
More like paradise.
Ha ha ha!

285
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,391
Is that the championship belt?

286
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,094
That's right, carved
into the Mountain.

287
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:48,698
A prize set in stone and the
dream of every superstar.

288
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,570
Mr. Sin Cara, could
we stop for a second?

289
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:03,380
Uhh!

290
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:05,648
Uhh!

291
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:09,786
Sweet.

292
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,789
Way to go, Ruben.
That was a nice job.

293
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:17,694
Yeah, nice move, Ruby.
Yeah, funktastic, baby.

294
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:23,199
Like, wow, I didn't know your
nephew dude was a superstar.

295
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,969
That's what he'd like to think.

296
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,671
I'd better get you all
settled into your cabins.

297
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,507
Up ahead on the left, Sin Cara.

298
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:43,219
I can't believe Shaggy and Scooby
left all our luggage behind.

299
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,422
Now all I have are
these two scarves.

300
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,824
Which do you think John
would like better?

301
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,192
Seriously?

302
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,860
Seriously.
Be honest.

303
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,496
The one on the right.

304
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,398
My thoughts exactly.

305
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,734
I don't understand, Uncle cookie.

306
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,270
It's just not fair.

307
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:04,974
You know I'm good.
I know you know I'm good.

308
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,577
Why won't you help me get into WWE?

309
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,613
Somebody's got to put
some sense into you.

310
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,583
Do you think I built this brace
because it looks good?

311
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,654
All it takes is one accident
to put you out of contention.

312
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,657
Maybe I'll be luckier. Maybe not.

313
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,158
You have to be practical.

314
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,061
You should keep going to
your computer classes.

315
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:29,466
Computers, that's the ticket, Ruby.

316
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:37,173
Poor Ruben.

317
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,176
I feel sorry for him.
It's understandable.

318
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:44,747
Ruben represents the heroic male aspiring
to the stature of decorated warrior.

319
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,885
His journey is relatable, and therefore
appealing to a wide audience.

320
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,620
Velma, has it ever occurred to you

321
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,858
that maybe WWE isn't something
you can scientifically explain?

322
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,092
Don't be silly, Daphne.

323
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,462
Science and logic
explain everything.

324
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:07,370
Hey, like, the most
awesome thing about WWE?

325
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,973
You get all the food you can eat.

326
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,542
Yeah. All the food.

327
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,245
Big day tomorrow.
Cookie said we get to see

328
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,946
some superstars training.

329
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:20,116
I want to grab some
wicked action shots.

330
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:25,755
Come on, lights out, you two.
Okie doke, Fred.

331
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,490
Sweet dreams, Scoob.

332
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:31,694
You, too, "Raggy".

333
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,463
All the food.

334
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,697
Food.

335
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,766
All the food.

336
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,069
Food, food, food, food,
food, food, food, food.

337
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,473
Food, food, food, food,
food, food, food, food.

338
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:49,112
Huh?

339
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,550
Huh?

340
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:00,223
Huh?

341
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:12,302
Ladies and gentlemen,

342
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:18,341
let's get ready to Scooby-Doo!

343
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:22,412
You want to take me on?
Bring it.

344
00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:30,253
Ahh!

345
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,428
Ahh!

346
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,972
Uhh.

347
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,662
Oh, yeah?

348
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:16,232
Prepare to become a Scooby snack.

349
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:23,840
Scoob.

350
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,642
Scooby-Doo.

351
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,943
Hmm?

352
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:30,947
Like, dude, what are you
doing with that bear?

353
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,548
Hmm?

354
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,185
Aah!

355
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,257
Zoinks!

356
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,437
Really?

357
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,005
Aah!

358
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,073
Uhh!

359
00:28:05,082 --> 00:28:06,082
Ooh!

360
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,885
Aah!

361
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,222
Back off, ugly.

362
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:21,764
Time to call your mama.

363
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,200
Aah! Ooh!

364
00:28:25,736 --> 00:28:27,570
Aah!

365
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:31,107
Uhh!

366
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:34,110
Not funky.

367
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,682
Shaggy! Scooby!
Are you ok?

368
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:18,921
Ghost... Ghost bear.

369
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,523
Then it's true.

370
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,493
What's true, cookie?
The legend.

371
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,995
The monster has returned
from the grave.

372
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:30,934
Vicious, the ghost bear has
come to challenge us all.

373
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,802
Oh.

374
00:29:34,271 --> 00:29:39,008
Well, gang, sounds like we have
another mystery on our hands?

375
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,262
Assault, battery, property damage.

376
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,632
Ghost bear!
What the heck is going on?

377
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,669
And what are you kids
doing in WWE City anyway?

378
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,806
We won a contest.
We won a contest.

379
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:15,111
Don't look at me, Richards.
You sent out that memo.

380
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:18,047
The victory dance contest.

381
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,883
Oh, that's right.
That wasn't my idea.

382
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,920
Boys over in marketing
or game development.

383
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,221
One of those.

384
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,658
Who can keep things straight with
all these bear attacks going on?

385
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,326
There have been others?

386
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,363
Indeed. Several.
All of them inside our buildings.

387
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:38,434
The creature trashed the kitchen and
totally obliterated our video game studio.

388
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:42,371
And as quickly as it
appears, it disappears.

389
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:45,107
I'm telling you, it's the ghost.

390
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,510
An evil from beyond the grave.

391
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,916
Let's try to remain calm here.

392
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,552
We don't want to jump to
any crazy conclusions.

393
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,921
Mr. McMahon.
Mr. McMahon.

394
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,089
Like, in the flesh.

395
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:03,092
I can't believe I'm actually
face to face with Vinnie Mac.

396
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,394
The boss.
The higher power.

397
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,430
The Mac attack.
The Mac daddy.

398
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,965
Daddy Mac.

399
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:13,102
Yes. Ahem. Thanks for that
trip down memory Lane.

400
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,604
Let me cut to the chase.

401
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,606
I've been doing a little
research on you kids.

402
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,641
You're some kind of
mystery solvers.

403
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:22,712
We could really use your help here.

404
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,414
Gee, Mr. McMahon, we'd be glad to.

405
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:28,317
My main concern is the
championship belt.

406
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,052
Not only is it worth a fortune,

407
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,389
but Wrestlemania wouldn't
be the same without it.

408
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:38,427
Excuse me, sir, but we don't need these
kids meddling in security matters.

409
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:42,031
I promise the championship
belt is well guarded 24/7

410
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,501
with a state-of-the-art electronic
laser trip wire alarm system.

411
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,036
There's no way the
bear could get to it

412
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,938
without tripping a beam
and setting off an alarm

413
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,208
that would bring in half my
security men within seconds.

414
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,178
I understand, Richards, but it couldn't
hurt to have these kids lend a hand.

415
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,947
It's what we do.

416
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:05,087
You mind if I help?
Um... great idea, John.

417
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,125
Awesome. Because I think there's
someone you should talk to.

418
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:25,541
Sin Cara?

419
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,611
He knows the legend of the
bear better than anyone.

420
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,213
Like, why is he hanging
out on the roof?

421
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:33,883
Sin Cara has a flair for drama.

422
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:41,157
Ahh.
Ahh.

423
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,528
But does he even talk?
He doesn't have to.

424
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,165
Luckily, I speak masked luchador.

425
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,567
I'll translate as best I can.

426
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,275
The legend of the ghost
bear begins 100 years ago

427
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,345
when a monstrous bear was
part of a traveling show.

428
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,679
They named him vicious.

429
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,081
And for good reason.

430
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,451
The creature had a mean streak
a mile wide and twice as ugly.

431
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,453
It'd never been beaten, ever.

432
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,189
Till it met...

433
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,992
Sin Cara Grande,

434
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,395
Sin Cara's great great
great grandfather.

435
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,465
He challenged the bear
on this very spot

436
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,234
long before there was
ever a WWE City.

437
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,272
The battle between man
and bear was epic.

438
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,878
The bear was a horrible,
unstoppable beast.

439
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:45,121
But when the match was over, it
was the man standing victorious.

440
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,595
The bear could not
contain its anger.

441
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:01,170
He unleashed his rage on the town.

442
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:04,173
Many lives would have
been lost that day

443
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:08,477
had it not been for the brave
luchador Sin Cara Grande.

444
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,219
While saving those innocent
townfolk, he was injured.

445
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:23,459
Sin Cara Grande would
never wrestle again.

446
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,894
And the bear?

447
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,197
It escaped into the woods, disappearing
into a cave north of town,

448
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,767
never to be seen again.
Until now.

449
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:34,904
Sin Cara believes the
spirit of the beast

450
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,173
has been stirred by
Wrestlemania itself,

451
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:41,710
which is why the monster has risen
from the grave to have its revenge.

452
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,780
But fear not.

453
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,116
It is now Sin Cara's honor and duty

454
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,819
to continue his great great
great grandfather's legacy

455
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,322
and protect WWE City at any cost.

456
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:56,392
Wow.
That's amazing, dude.

457
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,342
I have half a mind to
go out in the woods,

458
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:17,079
find that bear, and
rip its head off.

459
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,683
I don't know, Triple H,
he's awfully tough.

460
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,585
I think we should stick together.

461
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,688
What do you think, Miz?

462
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,090
Stick together.

463
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:35,564
I can't believe you two are still
hungry after the meal we had.

464
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,566
This is just a late night snack.

465
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,369
Right, Scoob?
Right. Helps us sleep.

466
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:43,339
Man, if you guys' muscles were
as big as your appetites,

467
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,342
you'd both be superstars.

468
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:55,317
Like, Fredster, don't you want
to join the Pizzapalooza?

469
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,519
Eh, no, thanks.

470
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,755
I thought I'd patrol with the guards,
maybe get a picture of the ghost bear.

471
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,124
I'll lock the door after me.

472
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:06,428
Like, to keep the bear out?
To keep Scooby in.

473
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,397
Good idea.

474
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:12,468
Like, don't worry, Freddy, the faster
we eat... the faster we fall asleep.

475
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:22,338
Ahh!

476
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,009
Yah!

477
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:34,717
Like, is something wrong,
Ms. Richards?

478
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,719
Indeed, there is.

479
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,756
The WWE championship
belt has been stolen.

480
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:46,061
And we know who did it.

481
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:50,499
Your dog.
Uh, but that's ridiculous.

482
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,068
Scooby-Doo's been in
here with me all night.

483
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,970
Isn't that right, old pal?

484
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,572
That's right.

485
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,574
Oh?

486
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,442
I saw that.

487
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,678
Uh-uh, nothing to see here.

488
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,513
Just me in bed.

489
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:13,689
You, sir... uh, dog, are a thief.

490
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,558
But, Ms. Richards, Scooby
couldn't have taken the belt.

491
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,927
He's never stolen anything
in his whole life.

492
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,829
Yeah, never.

493
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,865
I have proof right here.

494
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,502
Last night's security footage.
Take a look.

495
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,413
Ooh. Uhh.

496
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:59,268
I... I... I did steal it.

497
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,237
Say it ain't true, Scooby-Doo.

498
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,747
Hold on a second.

499
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,817
Is there something
strange about Scooby?

500
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,087
You really want us to answer that?

501
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:28,864
Yep, this is the
championship belt all right.

502
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,533
I'd know it anywhere.

503
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,136
Take it.

504
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,306
And we'll be taking the
thief with us as well.

505
00:39:38,408 --> 00:39:42,478
No! Don't let them take me, "Raggy".

506
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,113
No!

507
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,815
I won't, pal.
Hang on.

508
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,051
Don't let them take me, Raggy.

509
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,152
I'm innocent.

510
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,954
Jinkies! That's it.

511
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,389
Come on, we've got to work fast

512
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,324
if we're going to save Scooby.

513
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:07,503
All right, kids.

514
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,304
What's going on here?

515
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,507
Thanks for coming, Mr. McMahon.

516
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,308
We've asked you all
here to show you

517
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,511
that our Scooby isn't a thief.

518
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:19,081
He's just a pawn.
Allow me.

519
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:25,454
Here's the security video of
Scooby as he was taking the belt.

520
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:29,057
And here's the video file of Scooby
doing his winning victory dance

521
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,393
from the memory card of
Shaggy's video game.

522
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:34,963
Yeah, that's a funkadactal move.

523
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,933
Is there a point to any of this?

524
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,669
Watch as we slow down
the victory dance.

525
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:49,178
It's the same movement.

526
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,714
Scooby was programmed with
a post-hypnotic suggestion

527
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,417
to steal the championship belt.

528
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,687
Like, that's why he's been sleep
walking since he got here.

529
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:02,324
Ohh. Yeah.

530
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:07,196
And just how did the dog get
this post-hypnotic programming?

531
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,698
My guess is from the
video game itself.

532
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,200
May I?

533
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:16,572
I'm connecting Shaggy's
WWE video game file

534
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,274
to the tron screen.

535
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:33,055
See, someone highlighted
every move with light flashes.

536
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:35,157
Flashes which could have planted

537
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,726
a post-hypnotic suggestion
in Scooby's brain.

538
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:42,565
Yeah, there's a plant in my brain.

539
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,900
Nice hacks, Ruben.

540
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,002
That's my nephew.

541
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,338
He's a computer genius.

542
00:41:51,474 --> 00:41:55,511
Listen, kids, as compelling
as this theory might be,

543
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,713
I'm still a guy that likes
to look at the facts.

544
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,982
And the fact is, he stole it.

545
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,618
And he's going to jail for it.

546
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,721
Jail?

547
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:09,925
And it was your video game, so you're
going with him... as his accomplice.

548
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,594
Accomplice? I'm no accomplice!

549
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,863
I'm not even sure
I know what that means!

550
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,367
Miss Richards, isn't there something
we can do to prevent that?

551
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,103
No!
Actually, yes there is.

552
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:24,172
Whatever it is...
We'll do it.

553
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:27,843
WWE City law states that
anyone accused of a crime

554
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:31,547
can compete in the ring for a
chance to win their freedom.

555
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,051
I have the power to
give you that chance.

556
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:41,590
But I have only one competitor
left who is looking for a match.

557
00:42:54,137 --> 00:42:56,405
Kane!
Kane!

558
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:00,375
I want another shot at the title.

559
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:05,147
Looks like I'll have to go
through you two to get it.

560
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:08,483
I accept the challenge.

561
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:13,655
Like, you know, Scoob, I hear
prison food isn't that bad.

562
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,223
No!

563
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:18,093
You want a chance to prove
your innocence in the ring.

564
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,229
They accept the challenge,
Mr. McMahon.

565
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,970
Miss Richards, release these
two so they can prepare.

566
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,105
Unless they can prove
their innocence,

567
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,041
their match with Kane will
kick off Wrestlemania

568
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:36,745
tomorrow night.

569
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:58,567
Like, Velma, are you crazy?!

570
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:01,303
Yeah! We can't fight Kane.

571
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,338
Look, guys,
pull yourselves together.

572
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,775
I need you to buy us some time if
we're going to solve this mystery,

573
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,543
and clear Scooby's name.

574
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:11,246
I don't know, Velma,
we only have until tomorrow

575
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,248
before Shaggy and
Scooby get slaughtered.

576
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,884
Hello! Thanks, Fred.

577
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,553
They're going to need a
whole lot longer than a day

578
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,589
to learn how to
compete in the ring.

579
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,991
Could you help them, cookie?
Please?

580
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,961
Yeah, yeah, please, please, please!

581
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,896
Oh-ho-ho, please, cookie!

582
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:31,366
Eh, well, maybe I can
train 'em enough

583
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,735
so they might survive...

584
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,270
Ooh!

585
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,806
For a few minutes.

586
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,677
Aj, you want to help me here?

587
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,680
Sure, cookie.

588
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,515
Hi, boys.

589
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,684
I heard you could use
some practice sessions.

590
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:53,255
Wouldn't want those itty
bitty whiskers to get bent.

591
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,723
Like, Scooby-Doo,

592
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,959
you know, this may not
be so bad after all.

593
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:01,530
Aahh!

594
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,467
Never underestimate a diva.

595
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:12,134
You ok, Ruben?
No, I'm not ok.

596
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,636
I don't understand why my
Uncle is willing to train

597
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:16,705
Shaggy and Scooby and not me.

598
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:20,976
Just because he never won a
championship doesn't mean I can't.

599
00:46:23,045 --> 00:46:25,280
Sorry.

600
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,882
See, it's just because all my life,

601
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,951
I've dreamed of being
a WWE superstar.

602
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,421
I've even come up with my own name...
The Bone Bender.

603
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:35,757
I got an outfit I made out
of spandex and bones.

604
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,859
Real bones I ordered
off the Internet.

605
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,161
Want to see?

606
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:42,664
Well, maybe later.
Daphne?

607
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:46,067
You got to hide us!

608
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:49,704
Aj's like Kane, with lipstick!

609
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:52,374
Hey, gang, we got maps
of the whole area.

610
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:56,178
And I found the perfect place to start
looking for clues about the ghost bear.

611
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,214
Scooby, Shaggy.

612
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,616
Where you boys hiding?

613
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:06,121
Like, what are we waiting for?
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

614
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,800
Like, wouldn't it be
better to clear our names

615
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:21,736
than to go, you know, bear hunting?

616
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,939
That's just it, Shaggy.
I can't help thinking

617
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:27,742
that whoever framed Scooby is somehow
connected to the ghost bear.

618
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:31,112
Keep it down.
We don't want to attract Bayard.

619
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,815
You mean the hillbilly
with the thieving raccoon?

620
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,553
Yeah. Their cave is
right on his property.

621
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:49,731
Can't say I didn't warn 'em.

622
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:55,637
Zoinks!

623
00:47:57,807 --> 00:48:00,375
Aroo?
Run!

624
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:11,920
Run!

625
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,623
Scoob!

626
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:24,299
Aah!

627
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,334
Whoo-hoo-hoo-ah!

628
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:37,245
Oh! Ooh, hoo, whoa-ho!

629
00:48:45,554 --> 00:48:50,225
Aah!
Huh?!

630
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:11,046
Like, that was amazing!

631
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,248
Cen-amazing!

632
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,483
How'd you know where we were?

633
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,819
Daphne texted me.
Mmm.

634
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,587
Naturally.

635
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,022
What's going on?

636
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:24,025
Hillbilly hospitality.
We should keep moving.

637
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:27,462
Come on, I'll explain on the way.

638
00:49:39,075 --> 00:49:41,343
This is it, guys.

639
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:44,245
Bear cave.

640
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:48,083
Come on, follow me.

641
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,652
Now, that's rich.

642
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,655
Those dummies just
walked into a trap

643
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:58,259
that's better than
any I could make.

644
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,354
Bet you that was the original bear.

645
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,490
He doesn't look so vicious now.

646
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,992
How long do you think
he's been there?

647
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:34,029
Who cares, as long
as he stays there.

648
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,197
Yeah!

649
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:01,589
Like, man, what is
this crazy place?

650
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:04,859
My guess? The lair
of the ghost bear.

651
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:09,965
Like, he has a lot of junk
for a ghost... or a bear.

652
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,900
Not junk.

653
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,468
Clues!

654
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,669
What are those?

655
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:16,271
Books on hypnotism.

656
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:19,474
Hypnotic techniques and
subliminal hypnosis.

657
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:22,677
Jackpot!
Ohh!

658
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,979
I think we just found our
first piece of evidence

659
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,916
to get you guys off
the hook with Kane.

660
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,784
Evidence! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

661
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:32,287
We love evidence.

662
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:35,523
Mwah!
Hey, gang.

663
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,292
Check this out.

664
00:51:40,262 --> 00:51:42,730
Schematics for EMP.

665
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:45,366
What's an EMP?

666
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,735
What's a schematic?

667
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:51,106
An EMP is an electromagnetic pulse.

668
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,109
It's a device that can destroy
electronics within its range.

669
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,278
Urghh!

670
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,115
Look what I found.

671
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:04,319
This calendar has the date for
Wrestlemania circled in red.

672
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:08,089
R.I.P. WWE.

673
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:10,758
Fred!

674
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,327
Evidence photos, Velma.

675
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:15,230
Can't have an investigation
without evidence photos.

676
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:20,034
So someone thinks they're going to
knock the lights out on Wrestlemania?

677
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,370
Not on my watch!

678
00:52:26,408 --> 00:52:27,542
John!

679
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,711
Gh-gh-ghost bear!

680
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,252
Run!

681
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,092
Yikes!

682
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:03,912
Ohh!

683
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:06,748
Whoa!

684
00:53:09,418 --> 00:53:11,052
Ohhh!

685
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:14,289
Ah-ah-aaah!

686
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:04,973
Huh?!

687
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:14,649
We're right back where we started!

688
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,451
Jinkies!

689
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,653
And so's the ghost bear!

690
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,298
Where are the boys?!

691
00:55:20,115 --> 00:55:22,583
We got to get the evidence!

692
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:26,154
Don't worry, Shaggy.
I still have the photos.

693
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,355
Yeah!

694
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,725
No!

695
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,394
Yoinks!
Ahh!

696
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:40,868
Guys, hold on to something.

697
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:50,411
Aah... ohh?

698
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,415
Ohh!

699
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,754
Ah. Huh?

700
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,925
Boom!

701
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,534
Epic!

702
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,070
Ah, enough already!

703
00:56:25,948 --> 00:56:29,117
Hey! Over there!

704
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,052
Huh?

705
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:43,231
Hey! What do you know?

706
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:48,236
The caves are connected directly to
the storm drains under WWE City.

707
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:52,206
Giving that ghost bear
full access at any time.

708
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:05,086
So you see, Richards,
that's how the ghost bear

709
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,221
gets in and out of so
many places so quickly.

710
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:10,591
And we have reason to believe that
whoever's behind these bear attacks,

711
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,462
has planted an EMP device
right here in the stadium.

712
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:17,799
He could shut down the whole place
right in the middle of Wrestlemania.

713
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:21,836
We shouldn't take any risks.
We'll have to cancel the show.

714
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,038
We can't cancel Wrestlemania!

715
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,807
That's like canceling Christmas.

716
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,575
Not to mention my career.

717
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:31,045
Besides, what could anyone gain
but shutting off the lights?

718
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:34,248
Not only the lights,
but the TV cameras, too.

719
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,950
There'd be no show.

720
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,819
People would panic
in the pitch black.

721
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:40,021
They'd get hurt!

722
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,059
You're right, Sin Cara.

723
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,895
It would tarnish the
entire legacy of WWE.

724
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:49,464
Listen. I'll have my men

725
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,033
guard the stadium's
generators 24/7.

726
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:54,902
They'll check every square inch of
the building right before the show.

727
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,572
No one's going to get away
with anything under my watch.

728
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:01,676
One way or another,
Wrestlemania goes on.

729
00:58:02,978 --> 00:58:05,980
If the object of the EMP
is to create chaos,

730
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:09,484
you can bet that ghost bear is not
going to be far away when it happens.

731
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,487
I think we all know
what we need to do.

732
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,121
Run away?

733
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:17,725
Nope. We've got to turn
Wrestlemania into a trap.

734
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,527
A big bear trap.

735
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,430
Whatever you plan,
Fred, count me in.

736
00:58:24,399 --> 00:58:27,702
Come on, then.
We don't have much time.

737
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:51,526
Ladies and gentlemen,

738
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:56,364
announcing a new match
for tonight's event.

739
00:58:56,366 --> 00:59:03,771
Kane vs. Skinny man and dead meat.

740
00:59:09,077 --> 00:59:12,413
Like, do you think maybe the
gang has solved the mystery yet?

741
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:15,316
Because there's no mysteries
to where we're going.

742
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,952
Yeah. To the hospital.

743
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,987
No. The morgue!

744
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,757
Come on, guys, you got
to have confidence.

745
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,459
You have to get up there
and give it your all!

746
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:28,696
If you don't hold back; If you
battle with your heart and soul,

747
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,531
if you give everything you've got,

748
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:34,669
then you'll not only survive
this, you could win!

749
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:54,121
Nice knowin' ya.

750
00:59:55,691 --> 00:59:59,260
Hey, uh...
Break a leg, you two.

751
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,496
Ooh! If we're lucky.

752
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,098
Whoo-hoo!

753
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,302
Let the games begin!
Bring on the pain train!

754
01:00:16,778 --> 01:00:17,945
Whoo!

755
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:21,515
This is going to be great!
Yeah!

756
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:24,151
So awesome!

757
01:00:27,956 --> 01:00:30,925
Everybody in position?

758
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:33,160
Check.

759
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,229
Check.

760
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,765
Sin Cara's ready.

761
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:43,571
And so am I.
Triple H?

762
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,241
Ready out here.

763
01:00:57,886 --> 01:01:01,622
Welcome to Wrestlemania!

764
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,962
Allow me to show you
why we're all here...

765
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,764
Bring it up.

766
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:13,868
The WWE championship belt.

767
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:25,946
The superstar who wins
tonight's main event

768
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:30,451
will be the new WWE champion.

769
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:33,788
Jinkies! That's it. Fred,

770
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,924
I know where the electromagnetic
pulse device is.

771
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,696
Tonight's first match
is a big one, folks.

772
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:46,267
We have the newcomers,
skinny man and dead meat.

773
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:53,808
Ohh!
Ohh!

774
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,151
They'll be facing the
meanest competitor

775
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:06,320
in and out of the ring.

776
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:10,324
Back for revenge, determined
to destroy anyone

777
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,427
between him and the title.

778
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,731
I give you the big, red monster.

779
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,734
Kane!

780
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,614
This is a last man standing match.

781
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:35,983
The superstar who's unable
to answer a ten count

782
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:40,988
after being knocked down
is declared the loser.

783
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,261
Come on, Scoob, we got...

784
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,730
we got to keep it together!

785
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:51,932
Oh... oh... k!

786
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:59,039
After Kane is finished with
skinny man and dead meat,

787
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:03,344
we'll be scraping them off
the mat with a spatula.

788
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,517
And there's the bell.

789
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:11,919
Kane explodes across the ring.

790
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:15,990
Oh! There goes any
chance for a fair match.

791
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,227
Skinny man and dead meat...

792
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:23,164
slam into the big red monster.

793
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:28,603
Certainly that blow can
only increase Kane's fury.

794
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,571
Ohh!

795
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:36,343
Miss Richards, you have to open the
safe and check the championship belt!

796
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:41,248
Are you crazy? Look, I checked the entire
stadium for your electro-whatumacalit.

797
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,251
It's not here!
It's right there.

798
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,120
Impossible.

799
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:49,824
If only I had a magnet to prove it.

800
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:57,765
Wow! Where did you get that?

801
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:00,267
Luchadores... always
ready for anything.

802
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:03,838
Ok. Miss Richards,
this magnet will prove

803
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,407
that your championship
belt isn't gold.

804
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:09,376
Because if it sticks...

805
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:12,913
Then it's made of
iron and it's a fake.

806
01:04:15,183 --> 01:04:19,086
Caught in the clenches of Kane,
the newcomers are done for.

807
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:20,821
Whoa!

808
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:23,224
The bounce out of the ring
offers skinny man and dead meat

809
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,893
a chance for escape...
but look at this!

810
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:28,395
Kane has just taken the
match under the ring.

811
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,698
It's bedlam down below!

812
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:38,105
Huh?!
Ahh!

813
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,843
Not again!

814
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:45,746
Somebody get me another
desk out here, please.

815
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:47,448
Ha ha!

816
01:04:57,792 --> 01:05:00,794
Jinkies! The EMP is
about to go off.

817
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:02,663
We'll never get it far enough away.

818
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:05,499
The arena power generator
is right below us.

819
01:05:10,305 --> 01:05:13,474
I've got to warn everyone.

820
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,410
I have an idea.

821
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:22,850
Hold this and let go when I say.

822
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:26,120
Right... Ok.

823
01:05:37,332 --> 01:05:39,166
Now!

824
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:40,634
Eeh!

825
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,940
That wasn't supposed to happen.

826
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:58,018
Huh? Whoa!

827
01:06:08,763 --> 01:06:11,332
Huh? What's going on?
What happened?

828
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,867
What happened to the TV?!

829
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:16,837
Oh, man, this is awful!

830
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,506
Who turned out the lights?

831
01:06:33,555 --> 01:06:36,457
Ok, guys, it's here.

832
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,595
The fans are starting to panic.

833
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:44,865
Plan B. Here we go.

834
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:20,367
Whoo-hoo! Nice throw!

835
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:24,004
We can see!
Let there be light!

836
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:26,473
Funkadelic.

837
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,142
Part of the show?

838
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,677
That was just part of the show!
I was worried.

839
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,614
I'm fine now.
I'm ok!

840
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,683
Scooby! You can do it.

841
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,519
You know all the right moves.

842
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,154
I do?
Yeah!

843
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,923
From the video game.
I trust the massive power

844
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,692
of your superstar-tastic
dance moves.

845
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:49,263
Just pretend you're playing
the video game.

846
01:07:53,268 --> 01:07:55,636
I can do this.

847
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,371
I can do this!

848
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:13,220
That a boy, Scoob!

849
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:15,089
Huh?!

850
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:58,599
Ghost bear sighted.

851
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,901
Good. He's here.

852
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:04,805
Just like we thought he'd be.
The lights are starting to go.

853
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,241
Don't worry... Fred's on it.

854
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:09,076
Triple H.

855
01:09:11,546 --> 01:09:14,114
Ok, guys,

856
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:16,383
hit the generators.

857
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,382
Huh?

858
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:53,520
After a mysterious blackout,
we're somehow back on the air.

859
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,356
Hey! Dead meat's not dead yet.

860
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,692
Wow, look at that doggy move.

861
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,527
Go, dead meat!

862
01:10:08,536 --> 01:10:10,404
Freddy, go!

863
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,306
Plan C.

864
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:25,919
Hey, smokey!

865
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:28,255
Where's the fire?

866
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:32,492
Prepare to face the wrath
of the bone bender!

867
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:52,746
Is that a bear?!

868
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:55,249
Like, zoinks!

869
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,751
Is that Ruben?

870
01:11:04,092 --> 01:11:06,260
Ruben, no!

871
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:12,733
Whoa-oh-oh!

872
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,401
Ohhh!

873
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:19,640
I don't believe it, folks.

874
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:23,977
Kane has been flattened, and a new
competitor has entered the ring.

875
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:28,382
But wait! Someone has
activated the cage.

876
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:31,485
Sin Cara and John Cena
are leaping into the ring.

877
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:34,554
It's a cage match!

878
01:11:41,429 --> 01:11:43,230
Like, we're all doomed!

879
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:46,900
Don't worry, Shaggy.
I'll protect you.

880
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:50,537
The mysterious new competitor

881
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:53,440
attacks the bear from behind,
creating a distraction

882
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,109
for Cena to make a move.

883
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:59,079
But this powerful creature
turns the tables on them both.

884
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:03,517
Now Sin Cara stands alone.

885
01:12:05,953 --> 01:12:08,322
The fearless luchador attacks.

886
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,291
He glides around the
bear like lightning.

887
01:12:17,165 --> 01:12:19,633
The bear can't even touch Sin Cara.

888
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:23,603
Ladies and gentlemen, I haven't seen
moves like this in the ring before.

889
01:12:25,373 --> 01:12:28,709
Sin Cara delivers a
stunning blow to the bear

890
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:31,578
while John Cena
recovers on the mat.

891
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:35,449
He's going after the bear.
Cena is lifting the bear

892
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:37,451
over his head.

893
01:12:41,422 --> 01:12:43,890
And the bear is down.

894
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:47,861
Yeah!
Yay!

895
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,030
Yes!

896
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:53,567
What's that, bear, what's that?

897
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:56,203
You can't see me!

898
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:01,375
Ladies and gentlemen, here it is.

899
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:05,479
Cena's vintage five
knuckle shuffle.

900
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,921
It's lights out for
this big, bad bear.

901
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:16,923
This match is over.

902
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:19,259
Yay! Yay!

903
01:13:23,865 --> 01:13:28,535
Cena and Sin Cara going
for a tandem pin.

904
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,473
Impossible!

905
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:35,675
Huh?

906
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,521
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

907
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:51,024
Scooby-Doo, where are you?!

908
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:53,393
This looks bad for skinny man.

909
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:56,463
But wait, what is dead meat up to?

910
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,905
Dead meat has revived Kane.

911
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:08,975
The big, red monster has risen.

912
01:14:18,653 --> 01:14:21,855
Never before have we seen
a stand-off like this.

913
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:25,392
It's monster vs. Monster inside
the cage at Wrestlemania.

914
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:27,627
Who will survive this
supernatural match-up?

915
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:32,365
Who will be victorious in
this paranormal pandemonium?

916
01:14:37,371 --> 01:14:40,707
Kane drives the bear back
with a stunning blow.

917
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:43,276
The bear hits the mat.
Kane pins down its leg.

918
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:46,246
A new competitor,
John Cena and Sin Cara

919
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:50,350
pile onto the powerful creature,
but they can barely hold it down.

920
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,554
Scooby-Doo, it's up to you!

921
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:57,357
Only dead meat can
tip the balance now.

922
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:01,695
Can he do it?

923
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,864
Can dead meat save the day?

924
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:15,075
Scooby Doobie Doo!

925
01:15:18,713 --> 01:15:22,249
Dead meat just delivered a
gut-wrenching belly bomb

926
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:25,252
and flattened the ring
and exploded the cage!

927
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,654
The dust is clearing now.

928
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:32,526
The bear is out cold.

929
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,728
Dead meat wins it!

930
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,366
Whoo!

931
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,834
Dead meat!

932
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:43,036
That bear is toast!

933
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:57,784
You ok, Velm?

934
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:01,454
This... Is... Awesome!

935
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:05,358
Whoo-hoo!

936
01:16:19,307 --> 01:16:23,109
Now let's see who this
ghost bear really is.

937
01:16:26,714 --> 01:16:29,416
Cookie?!
Cookie?!

938
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:32,552
Cookie?!
Uncle cookie!

939
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:34,020
Why?

940
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:36,222
WWE is your life.

941
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:38,291
WWE was his life,

942
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,760
but sadly, your Uncle cookie
never got the glory...

943
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,996
And his injury put him
out of the spotlight.

944
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:44,531
Permanently.

945
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,766
He started to truly resent WWE

946
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:50,804
because he knew he could never be the
champion he always dreamed of being.

947
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:53,607
That resentment grew into
hatred over the years,

948
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,309
as he trained others to
be what he could not.

949
01:16:56,311 --> 01:17:00,180
That's when he developed
his plan for revenge.

950
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:01,881
But that wouldn't be enough.

951
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:05,151
He needed a pawn to steal
the championship belt.

952
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:09,389
That's when he devised the idea
of hacking into a video game

953
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:12,559
and placing post-hypnotic
suggestions into it.

954
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,494
That game would become
part of a contest,

955
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:18,798
which cookie set up with fake
emails he sent throughout WWE.

956
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,736
That's why he used the bear to
attack your video game studio.

957
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,638
To cover his tracks.

958
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,240
The contest assured that
only the most skilled pawn

959
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:30,176
would arrive at WWE City
to aid in the theft.

960
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:35,215
Cookie then used flashing lights to activate
Scooby's post-hypnotic programming.

961
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:39,252
When cookie identified the belt in
Scooby's bed as the championship belt,

962
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:42,088
he was lying.
He'd already switched them.

963
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:47,027
With Scooby taking the blame, cookie was
free to carry out his ultimate plan.

964
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:49,696
Which was to turn out the lights,
and with the help of the bear,

965
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:52,766
create so much panic and injury...

966
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:59,005
That Wrestlemania would be completely
ruined and WWE would never recover.

967
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:02,108
But thanks to Fred here, we got
the lights back on pretty quick.

968
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,643
Good work!

969
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:06,312
Ah, um, thanks.

970
01:18:08,849 --> 01:18:12,552
And the real championship
belt, where is it now?

971
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:15,188
Elementary, my dear Mr. McMahon.

972
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,890
Cookie's wearing it.

973
01:18:22,897 --> 01:18:24,831
Sorry, cookie.

974
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:28,368
But the championship belt isn't
for cheaters, it's for champions.

975
01:18:36,744 --> 01:18:39,412
Good call, hiring these kids, sir.

976
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:41,147
I thought they might come in handy.

977
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,649
Just get cookie out of here!

978
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:45,952
Yes, sir, will do, sir, you bet.

979
01:18:52,626 --> 01:18:56,629
A championship belt was the
icing on the cake, Mr. McMahon.

980
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:59,933
Cookie could live off its golden
jewels for the rest of his life.

981
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:01,201
Boo!

982
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:03,636
And I would have gotten
away with it, too,

983
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,206
if it weren't for you meddling kids

984
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,742
and your giant, crazy dog!

985
01:19:12,313 --> 01:19:15,515
I guess after what my Uncle's done,

986
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:17,817
you won't be wanting
me around anymore.

987
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:20,820
Not so, Ruby.
You're one of us now.

988
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:22,522
You got the funk, son!

989
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:26,092
That's right, Ruben. You've shown
a superstar spirit in the ring,

990
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,128
and at the computer.

991
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:31,131
You've earned a place with us
in whatever you want to do.

992
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,800
The choice is yours.

993
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:36,803
Thanks, Mr. McMahon.

994
01:19:41,342 --> 01:19:44,811
Now that we have the
real championship belt,

995
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:47,847
it needs to be awarded
to true champions.

996
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:51,117
And after what I've seen
tonight, they're right here.

997
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,287
Skinny man and dead meat!

998
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:18,178
Really?
Huh?

999
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,514
Well done.

1000
01:20:26,654 --> 01:20:29,989
Scooby-Doo!

1001
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,592
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

1002
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:35,461
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

1003
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:38,097
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

1004
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:41,367
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

1005
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:44,871
Scooby-Doo!
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

1006
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:48,107
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

1007
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:50,810
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

1008
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:55,148
Scooby Doobie doo!

1009
01:20:56,305 --> 01:21:56,258
