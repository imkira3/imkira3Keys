2
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:27,556
Go, go, go, go!
Move it, move it!

3
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,684
Move it! Let's go!

4
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:35,480
Move, move! In the car!
Let's go.

5
00:03:37,232 --> 00:03:38,317
Let's go!

6
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,110
There's 4 of you.

7
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:42,029
You can count.
I'm impressed. Now drive.

8
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:43,989
Rule one...
Never change the deal.

9
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:45,324
The deal was
transportation...

10
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:46,658
for 3 men
with a combined weight...

11
00:03:46,783 --> 00:03:48,243
of 254 kilos.

12
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:50,787
Yeah? Well,
this is a new deal.

13
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:52,998
An extra 80 kilos
means we'll not make...

14
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:54,958
your destination on
the gas I have allotted.

15
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,501
So we'll stop
and get more gas!

16
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:57,794
Every stop we make
exposes us.

17
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,837
Every exposure...

18
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:00,672
increases the risk
of getting caught.

19
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:03,383
An extra 80 kilos means
the Koni shock absorbers...

20
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,177
I installed for this job
will not give us...

21
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,220
the ability
to outmaneuver...

22
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:08,347
any police that might
be chasing us.

23
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,974
Which means,
if there is a chase...

24
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,435
we lose our advantage,
which also increases...

25
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,895
the possibility
of getting caught.

26
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:17,064
I don't want
to get caught.

27
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:18,524
You don't want
to get caught.

28
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,983
Just drive the car, man...

29
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,401
or you're gonna catch
a bullet through the brains!

30
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:22,653
And who's going
to drive?

31
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:24,154
Shoot this asshole!
I'll drive.

32
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,281
Not without the ignition
code you won't.

33
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,624
3 men. 254 kilos.

34
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:37,668
That was the deal.

35
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:41,338
Argh!

36
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:47,928
3 men, 254 kilos.

37
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:49,972
Seat belts.

38
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:51,223
Argh!

39
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:58,397
Shit!

40
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:35,017
See what I mean
about the shocks?

41
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:42,149
Now it's time.

42
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:50,657
Cop:
Move it, Marcel, move it!

43
00:05:51,825 --> 00:05:53,911
Look out!
Get out of the road!

44
00:05:57,915 --> 00:05:59,458
One way, one way!

45
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,376
We're going
the wrong way!

46
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:03,003
Stop it,
Marcel, stop!

47
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:06,507
Move away!

48
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:11,094
Look out, look out!

49
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,721
Whoa!

50
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,640
Whoo-hoo!

51
00:06:26,902 --> 00:06:31,240
Yes!

52
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:33,617
Go, go, go!

53
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:34,660
Merde!

54
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:49,174
Oh... shit!

55
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:21,748
If you don't mind...

56
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,083
I just conditioned
the leather back there.

57
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:27,713
Take us to the drop point!

58
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:28,922
Not yet.

59
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:47,191
Hello.

60
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:49,276
The cops, the cops!

61
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,777
What are you doing?
Don't stop now!

62
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,362
Thug 1: Do something!
Come on, do something!

63
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:54,406
What are you thinking?

64
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,440
Your gun, please.

65
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:22,578
Police! Stop!

66
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,413
Stop! Police!

67
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:31,795
I'm fed up with this car chase!

68
00:09:56,486 --> 00:09:58,071
You gave me too much.

69
00:09:58,155 --> 00:10:01,158
We need you to take us to Avignon.

70
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:04,953
The deal was this far
and no further.

71
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,539
The deal is the deal.
Rule number one.

72
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:08,624
Rules are meant to be broken.

73
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,042
Not mine.

74
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,757
Let's go. Get in the car.

75
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,717
Come on! Quick!

76
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:21,595
Move it!

77
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,181
Man 1 On TV:
Really I did.

78
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:07,724
Man On TV 2:
Oh, yeah, well, how come...

79
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,059
you don't have your
yellow card with you?

80
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:10,686
Well, I... I...

81
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,396
must've left it
back in Nam on the base.

82
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:13,939
Yeah, they all say that.

83
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:15,357
"Left it back in Nam
on the base. " Uh-huh.

84
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:17,067
Let me show you
what we do to people...

85
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,485
who left it back in Nam
on the base.

86
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,903
Oh, no!
Please let go of me!

87
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:21,154
Where are you taking me?

88
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,031
You gotta be punished
for not carrying...

89
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:25,158
your shot record on you.
It's a fate far worse than death.

90
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:33,876
Newscaster: The Argentinian
government reaffirmed...

91
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:34,918
its commitment to meeting...

92
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:37,671
the I.M. F's target
this year.

93
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:39,756
And yesterday, in Nice...

94
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,301
4 men robbed the Alliance
Investment Corporation.

95
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:44,761
One man died
on the sidewalk.

96
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:47,639
The others were apprehended
early this morning...

97
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:50,684
when they took a wrong turn
on a one-way street...

98
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,103
in Avignon and ran into
a taxi cab.

99
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:54,188
The police said...

100
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:55,731
were it not for their
poor driving habits...

101
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:57,900
the 20 million euros
in bearer bonds...

102
00:11:58,025 --> 00:12:01,069
would have been cashed
and gone by this afternoon.

103
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,071
And in other news...

104
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:09,077
I always say the way
a man treats his car...

105
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,122
is how he treats himself.

106
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:13,874
I'd say that's probably true,
Inspector.

107
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,668
Heh heh heh!
You have a good sense of humor...

108
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:18,462
for a foreigner,
Monsieur Frank.

109
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:20,964
Like the French.
Sly wit.

110
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:23,342
Just the right amount
of flavor.

111
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:24,676
Been out driving?

112
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:26,970
Until they pass a law
that says I can't.

113
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:28,639
You want to come in
for a coffee?

114
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:30,182
Uh, thank you...

115
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:32,267
but I have a lot
of stops to make.

116
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:33,894
88 to be exact.

117
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:36,313
That's a lot of stops.

118
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:40,776
A lot of 1999
black BMW 765s...

119
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:44,363
with 06 in the license
plates to check out.

120
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:46,156
Oh, it's a very
popular car...

121
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,116
with a certain type
down here.

122
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,618
You've seen them.

123
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:50,994
They come over from Italy...

124
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,871
in those very expensive suits...

125
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:54,081
and the young pretty girls...

126
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,875
with the big jewelry
and too much make-up.

127
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,962
Very... Mafia.

128
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:01,797
There was a robbery.

129
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,048
A getaway.

130
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:06,802
Some very fancy driving.

131
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:11,265
By someone in a 1999
black BMW 735?

132
00:13:11,348 --> 00:13:13,350
With 06 on the plate.

133
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:17,062
You have been
in the city lately?

134
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:18,772
Not for a while.

135
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:21,692
I love Nice.
The food...

136
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:23,193
the way they grill fish.

137
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:25,362
No place else in France does it...

138
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:26,530
the way they do in Nice.

139
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,448
And the women...

140
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,451
I prefer the women there.

141
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:35,205
They are more...
complicated...

142
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,583
than the local variety.

143
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,669
Don't you think?

144
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:43,130
I don't particularly
like complicated.

145
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:44,798
You like to keep it simple.

146
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:46,341
Why are you so interested?

147
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,343
Oh, you know, uh...

148
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:49,928
ever since
I'm a little boy...

149
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:52,222
military people
have always intrigued me.

150
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,183
I'm ex-military.

151
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,102
I'm an ex-little boy.

152
00:14:02,983 --> 00:14:05,110
Sure you don't have time
for a coffee?

153
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:07,487
Everything is always...

154
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:09,865
so neat with you,
Monsieur Frank.

155
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:14,203
Nothing ever out of place.

156
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,787
I'll take that as a compliment...

157
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:19,333
coming from a man who pays
attention to every detail.

158
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,754
Maybe I'll come back
later for that coffee.

159
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:27,424
Door's always open to you.

160
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:29,218
Hmph.

161
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,014
Unh. Ahh.

162
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:41,855
Man On Phone:
Lupo gave me your number.

163
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:42,940
Be brief.

164
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:44,191
I'm looking for a transporter.

165
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:45,484
I'm listening.

166
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:48,737
#Are you ready? #

167
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:50,072
#Are you ready... #

168
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,158
One bag, that's it.

169
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:54,409
Dimensions.

170
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:57,746
Be specific.

171
00:14:57,871 --> 00:14:59,790
One meter fifty
by half meter.

172
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:00,791
Weight?

173
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,960
50 kilos, not more.

174
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:07,673
Destination?

175
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:08,841
24 Rue de Luxembourg.

176
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:10,634
You're delivering to Mister...

177
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:12,719
Rule 2... No names.

178
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:16,849
Time of pickup?

179
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:20,477
7:00 in the morning
at the front door.

180
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:24,815
A package,
one meter fifty by fifty...

181
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:27,109
50 kilos,
250 kilometers...

182
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,235
travelling within
the speed limit...

183
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,653
one stop for refreshments...

184
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:31,530
40,000.

185
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:33,156
Half now, half on delivery.

186
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:34,992
Delivery will be at noon.

187
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:37,452
If no one's there,
it is not my responsibility.

188
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,288
I'll leave the package.
Once we make a deal...

189
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,789
the terms of that deal
cannot be changed...

190
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:41,999
or renegotiated.

191
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:43,083
Another rule?

192
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,627
It's rule number one.

193
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:46,920
Do we have a deal?

194
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,803
You're very precise.

195
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:57,514
Transportation is
a precise business.

196
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,161
Flat.

197
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:23,720
Hi.

198
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:30,394
Now, don't move.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

199
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:32,020
I'm just gonna
make a little hole...

200
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,522
so you can drink.
That's all I'm gonna do.

201
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,857
Please... please!
Please, come on.

202
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:51,999
Come on, drink.

203
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,420
Slowly.

204
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,056
OK, OK, that's enough.

205
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,767
Good girl.

206
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,435
I'm going to take
the tape off.

207
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,978
If you scream,
I'll have to kill you.

208
00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:57,898
You understand?

209
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,067
I have to pee!

210
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,529
You want me to do it
in your car?

211
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,366
OK.

212
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:09,493
Mmph!

213
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:18,836
I'm gonna take my knife out...

214
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:21,839
so don't scream, OK?
It's to cut you free.

215
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:27,594
You don't need
your mouth to pee.

216
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,645
You have one minute.

217
00:21:40,107 --> 00:21:42,860
55... 54...

218
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:46,697
53... 52...

219
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,746
You're breaking
the rules, Frank.

220
00:21:54,872 --> 00:21:56,707
Not good to break the rules.

221
00:22:04,882 --> 00:22:07,092
15...

222
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:12,264
7...

223
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:17,019
2...

224
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,021
Time's up.

225
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:23,442
Don't make me drag you out.

226
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:37,789
Shit!

227
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,711
No, please! Nnn!

228
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:28,507
Rule 3...
Never look in the package.

229
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,592
Hope you enjoyed your pee...

230
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,761
because it's your
last on this trip.

231
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,919
See what comes
of breaking the rules?

232
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:14,887
#Yeah, yeah #

233
00:24:17,347 --> 00:24:21,310
# My music, my life,
my heart, my soul... #

234
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,187
Woman:
Jerk!

235
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,772
# My wife, my daughter,
my love, my dream #

236
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,483
# My mother, my father,
my brother, my team #

237
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,361
# My camp, my squad,
my house, my car #

238
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:34,156
# My boat, my shoes,
my pants, my shirt #

239
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:36,992
# My coke, my sugar,
my cream, my butter #

240
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:40,037
# My toast, my all
my queen, my folks #

241
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:43,123
# My baby
walk like 6 strings tall #

242
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:47,794
#Talk like she's my everything #

243
00:24:47,878 --> 00:24:48,879
You're late.

244
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:51,507
Ran into a little problem.

245
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:53,926
Nothing serious?

246
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,181
Nothing serious.

247
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:14,029
You open the package?

248
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:17,199
Rule 3...
Never open the package.

249
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,535
Ha! I like that.

250
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,703
Rules.

251
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:25,249
You can't get anything done
in the world without rules.

252
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:27,209
You're a foreigner, right?

253
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,293
This is a nice little thing...

254
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:29,878
you've got going
for yourself here.

255
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:34,258
High class,
good reputation.

256
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:35,509
I didn't get your name.

257
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:38,178
Rule 2... No names.

258
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,222
Of course.

259
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:54,778
You don't count it?

260
00:25:54,862 --> 00:25:57,656
Why? Should I?

261
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,157
No, no.

262
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:00,951
That concludes the deal.

263
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:09,710
You know,
I was wondering...

264
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:11,170
if you wouldn't mind...

265
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:13,547
transporting something for me.

266
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,632
That's what you do, right?

267
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:18,218
You deliver,
no questions asked.

268
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,056
Why not?

269
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,725
Mmm!

270
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,605
Weight?

271
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,317
Oh, maybe a kilo.

272
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:34,735
Destination?

273
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,905
Grenoble, 306 Rue du Lac...

274
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,531
a Mister...

275
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:42,576
Oh, right. I forgot.

276
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:43,785
Rule 2.

277
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:03,722
Heh heh heh!

278
00:27:03,847 --> 00:27:05,516
I like him.

279
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:41,987
Thug:
What the fuck?!

280
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:54,708
Come on!

281
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:14,686
Where is he?

282
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,919
You're like dog shit!
You're everywhere.

283
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:45,671
Yeah.

284
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:46,922
I know, you wanna pee.

285
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:48,882
All you wanna do is pee.

286
00:31:57,641 --> 00:31:59,309
Shit.

287
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,319
# I got love #

288
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:11,405
# I got love for #

289
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,448
# My homies
who be rollin' wit me #

290
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:14,867
# Play no game #

291
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,451
# Play no games #

292
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,787
Frank, you stupid shit.

293
00:32:18,912 --> 00:32:21,790
# I got love #

294
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:24,251
# For my niggaz
on my family tree #

295
00:32:24,334 --> 00:32:25,502
# I got love #

296
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:27,713
# Love for the ghetto,
down for whatever #

297
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:29,047
# If you was down before #

298
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:31,884
#You gon' still
gon' be down wit me #

299
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:35,095
# I got game 'cause
the game was given to me #

300
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,961
I ask the questions.
You answer the questions.

301
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:51,046
No long speeches.
Just keep it simple.

302
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:52,297
Got it?

303
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,302
Who are you?

304
00:33:57,386 --> 00:33:59,388
My name is Lai.
I come from Chi...

305
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:04,059
I ask the questions.
You answer the questions.

306
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,727
Nothing more.
Nothing less.

307
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:08,188
You want to try again?

308
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,652
What kind of shit am I in?

309
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:16,071
Deep shit.
Very deep shit.

310
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:18,156
Those guys...
Sorry! Sorry!

311
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,491
I won't say any...
Mm!

312
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:51,732
Bon appétit.

313
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,400
Where are you going?

314
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:55,819
To bed.

315
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:56,987
I can't think straight
when I'm tired.

316
00:34:57,112 --> 00:34:58,197
After a good night's sleep...

317
00:34:58,322 --> 00:34:59,656
I always see things better.

318
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:00,824
Can I leave?

319
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:02,326
Be my guest.

320
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,943
Hey...

321
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:02,654
are you comfortable?

322
00:37:02,738 --> 00:37:04,364
Boss...

323
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:05,449
Save your strength.

324
00:37:05,574 --> 00:37:09,203
Just tell me, who did this?

325
00:37:09,286 --> 00:37:11,997
The transporter.

326
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:15,125
The transporter's dead.

327
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:17,127
He's not.

328
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:24,134
Believe me.

329
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:28,013
I believe you.

330
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:32,392
And the police?
They were here?

331
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:33,852
No.

332
00:37:33,936 --> 00:37:35,521
You told them nothing, right?

333
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:37,523
Right.

334
00:37:37,606 --> 00:37:40,150
Of course...

335
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:43,862
you couldn't talk.

336
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:45,739
Yeah.

337
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,037
Let's keep it that way.

338
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,891
I picked them
from the garden outside.

339
00:38:53,974 --> 00:38:56,894
I hope you don't mind.

340
00:38:56,977 --> 00:38:59,897
I didn't know
if you like coffee...

341
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,523
or tea,
so I made both.

342
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,247
I hope you like, uh...

343
00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:19,833
"ma-de-leine. "

344
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,919
Try one.

345
00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:26,423
Careful.

346
00:39:26,548 --> 00:39:27,758
It's hot.

347
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:32,137
Good?

348
00:39:38,227 --> 00:39:39,645
Let me.

349
00:39:41,522 --> 00:39:43,273
I like it quiet in the morning.

350
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:45,400
Yes.
Quiet in the morning.

351
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:46,818
Me, too.
Me, too.

352
00:39:46,902 --> 00:39:50,531
I'm the same way.
I like very quiet.

353
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:54,576
Sorry.

354
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,084
Are you looking for milk?

355
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:05,629
There's milk at the door.

356
00:40:05,712 --> 00:40:07,965
Stay, stay.
I'll go.

357
00:40:13,595 --> 00:40:14,513
Hi.

358
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:18,892
And you are?

359
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:21,144
The new cook.

360
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,689
Is Monsieur Frank in?

361
00:40:23,772 --> 00:40:27,025
Ah! Monsieur Frank.

362
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:30,195
Is your invitation
for coffee still open?

363
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,947
Sure, come on.
Please, sit.

364
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:35,534
Madeleine?

365
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:36,535
Homemade?

366
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,953
Yes.

367
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,746
I'll bring some more.

368
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:40,873
Ah.

369
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:42,875
My mother used to make...

370
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:44,209
fresh madeleines every morning.

371
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:46,461
I smell them
and my whole childhood...

372
00:40:46,587 --> 00:40:48,589
comes back in one big flood...

373
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:50,340
like Proust.

374
00:40:50,424 --> 00:40:52,092
You ever read Proust,
Monsieur Frank?

375
00:40:52,176 --> 00:40:53,635
No.

376
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,928
Ah. He's fantastic.

377
00:40:55,012 --> 00:40:56,930
Memory like a steel trap.

378
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:58,557
He would have been a great cop.

379
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,641
A real detail man.

380
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:01,268
- Milk?
- Please. Mmm.

381
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:06,273
Thank you.
Ahh.

382
00:41:06,356 --> 00:41:08,775
Tarconi:
I used to have a memory like Proust.

383
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:11,028
Like a filing cabinet up there.

384
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:13,614
I would see something
and remember it like that.

385
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:15,240
Like, uh, license plates.

386
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:18,327
I could see a plate
and it was printed in my head.

387
00:41:18,452 --> 00:41:20,287
Now I need all
the help I can get...

388
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:21,997
remembering whose plate...

389
00:41:22,122 --> 00:41:23,457
goes with whose car.

390
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:26,585
Like, uh, this one.

391
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:29,880
It's mine.

392
00:41:30,005 --> 00:41:32,257
Ah, memories.

393
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:33,509
So?

394
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:34,801
Where's the rest
of the car?

395
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:36,803
I was hoping
you could tell me.

396
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:38,388
- It was stolen.
- Stolen?

397
00:41:38,472 --> 00:41:40,516
Yeah, I went down to Frejus
to pick up a few things.

398
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,017
When I came out
of the market, it was...

399
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,020
Gone.
Did you report it?

400
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:48,190
It's the first on my list
of things to do today.

401
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:49,191
It's a long walk
from Frejus.

402
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:50,275
How did you get home?

403
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:51,527
Well...

404
00:41:51,652 --> 00:41:54,071
I brought him.

405
00:41:54,154 --> 00:41:56,532
I saw him walking
along the dark road.

406
00:41:56,657 --> 00:41:58,617
Mm, a risky thing.

407
00:41:58,742 --> 00:42:01,036
Picking up a stranger
on a dark road.

408
00:42:02,204 --> 00:42:04,039
He had a kind face.

409
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:09,336
I didn't see
a car outside.

410
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:10,546
It's in the garage.

411
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:11,588
May I see it?

412
00:42:11,672 --> 00:42:12,923
Mm-hmm.

413
00:42:33,277 --> 00:42:35,946
Pretty nice car
for a cook.

414
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,034
Some people have a problem
with the Germans.

415
00:42:41,118 --> 00:42:42,244
They're too aggressive.

416
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:44,663
They take up
the best beaches in summer.

417
00:42:44,788 --> 00:42:46,790
They can't cook worth a damn.

418
00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:52,129
I say anyone
who makes such great cars...

419
00:42:52,254 --> 00:42:54,965
can't be all bad.

420
00:42:55,048 --> 00:42:56,717
I would say your intuition
worked out very well...

421
00:42:56,842 --> 00:42:57,801
for Monsieur Frank,
mademoiselle.

422
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:02,181
Worked out for both of us.

423
00:43:06,643 --> 00:43:08,562
Bon.

424
00:43:08,645 --> 00:43:10,898
My intuition says
this is probably a good time...

425
00:43:10,981 --> 00:43:13,442
for me to go
file my report.

426
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:14,985
Where's the rest
of my car?

427
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,361
Oh, yes.

428
00:43:16,486 --> 00:43:17,946
I almost forgot.

429
00:43:18,071 --> 00:43:20,324
It was blown to pieces
at a rest stop.

430
00:43:21,658 --> 00:43:24,578
What's left of it
is down at the lab.

431
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:27,164
They're trying to separate
what was left...

432
00:43:27,247 --> 00:43:29,208
of the 2 cops in the trunk...

433
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,418
from the rest of it.

434
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:34,338
But, uh, you wouldn't know
anything about that?

435
00:43:34,421 --> 00:43:36,089
No.

436
00:43:36,215 --> 00:43:37,633
Sorry to interrupt.

437
00:43:37,758 --> 00:43:40,302
Thank you for the coffee
and the memories.

438
00:43:40,427 --> 00:43:42,137
Come back any time.

439
00:43:42,262 --> 00:43:44,139
Would you mind walking me?

440
00:43:44,264 --> 00:43:45,974
Come on.

441
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:47,559
You have always
been very quiet...

442
00:43:47,684 --> 00:43:49,478
about your business,
Monsieur Frank.

443
00:43:49,603 --> 00:43:52,439
I appreciate that.
Less work for Mother.

444
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:54,316
But this business
at the rest stop.

445
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:56,610
That is not very quiet.

446
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:58,362
I don't suppose you
would like to tell me...

447
00:43:58,487 --> 00:44:00,906
something besides
a stolen car story?

448
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:02,741
If I had one I would.

449
00:44:02,825 --> 00:44:05,619
Well, may I suggest
that when the 2 of you...

450
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:07,496
show up in my office
after lunch...

451
00:44:07,621 --> 00:44:09,206
you do have one.

452
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:11,792
A better one
than you currently have.

453
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,843
You are the one
he wants to see...

454
00:44:20,926 --> 00:44:21,844
not me!

455
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:23,387
Quiet!

456
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,514
Please, I have to think.

457
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:27,558
You were supposed
to think last night.

458
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:30,060
Yeah, well,
last night I had nightmares...

459
00:44:30,143 --> 00:44:33,188
about a girl who came
into my nice, quiet life...

460
00:44:33,272 --> 00:44:34,773
screwed it all up.

461
00:44:34,857 --> 00:44:35,941
Everything she touched broke...

462
00:44:36,066 --> 00:44:37,943
and every move she made
turned into a catastrophe.

463
00:44:38,026 --> 00:44:40,237
OK. Sorry.

464
00:44:42,656 --> 00:44:44,992
I'm still wondering
if I want to know everything...

465
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:47,244
or nothing about you.

466
00:44:55,752 --> 00:44:57,337
What?

467
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:58,839
The quiet.

468
00:44:58,922 --> 00:45:01,216
I thought you liked quiet.

469
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:07,014
Yeah, not this quiet.

470
00:45:26,867 --> 00:45:27,743
You OK?

471
00:45:27,868 --> 00:45:28,744
No!

472
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:30,120
Good. Let's go.

473
00:45:40,088 --> 00:45:41,006
Go! Go! Go!

474
00:45:54,436 --> 00:45:55,479
No, don't stay there!

475
00:45:55,604 --> 00:45:56,688
No!

476
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:25,843
Frank!

477
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:29,179
Come on,
give me your hand!

478
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:54,913
Come on!

479
00:46:57,124 --> 00:46:58,625
Come on, get in!
Get in!

480
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,627
- No! No!
- Get in!

481
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:06,508
Lai, look!
Come on, you wanna die?!

482
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:07,843
Get in!

483
00:47:31,658 --> 00:47:33,035
Calm down, OK?

484
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,412
Don't worry.
You OK?

485
00:47:36,538 --> 00:47:37,831
Stay here.
I'm coming back.

486
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:40,209
No, wait! Wait!

487
00:47:53,472 --> 00:47:55,098
Put it on.

488
00:47:57,684 --> 00:47:58,936
You OK?

489
00:47:59,019 --> 00:48:00,479
Sure?

490
00:48:00,562 --> 00:48:02,147
OK, let's go.

491
00:49:41,705 --> 00:49:43,832
Frank?

492
00:49:43,957 --> 00:49:45,667
Is this your house?

493
00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:50,506
Frank?

494
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:52,466
Yeah, guess.

495
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:57,346
Frank.

496
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:06,563
I should mind
my own goddamn business.

497
00:50:08,565 --> 00:50:11,860
A simple rule.
A simple, little rule.

498
00:50:11,985 --> 00:50:13,278
There's gotta be
some dry clothes...

499
00:50:13,362 --> 00:50:16,281
in this house.

500
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:19,785
Don't open the package.

501
00:50:19,868 --> 00:50:21,411
Nothing but trouble,
you open the goddamn package.

502
00:50:23,288 --> 00:50:24,206
Frank.

503
00:50:28,377 --> 00:50:29,253
What are you doing?

504
00:50:29,378 --> 00:50:31,088
Making up for the trouble.

505
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:38,595
Wait, wait.

506
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,638
Why are you making...

507
00:50:39,763 --> 00:50:41,139
No more questions.

508
00:50:43,725 --> 00:50:44,768
Wait.

509
00:50:44,852 --> 00:50:46,812
I don't like it
when things get complicated.

510
00:50:46,895 --> 00:50:49,273
You like things simple.

511
00:50:49,356 --> 00:50:50,983
Very simple.

512
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:09,126
I'm not so clear
about the house.

513
00:51:09,209 --> 00:51:11,545
Could you explain...

514
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:14,006
uh, one more time.
After I left.

515
00:51:14,089 --> 00:51:16,049
After you left, we went
for a walk on the beach.

516
00:51:16,175 --> 00:51:17,509
- Had a swim.
- Where again?

517
00:51:17,634 --> 00:51:18,677
Past the point.

518
00:51:18,802 --> 00:51:20,470
Anyone else swimming
at that time?

519
00:51:20,554 --> 00:51:21,471
No.

520
00:51:21,555 --> 00:51:22,764
Did you see
anybody else swimming?

521
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,391
No. No one.

522
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:29,188
So, you took a walk,
had a swim...

523
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:31,481
on a beach where no one
else was swimming...

524
00:51:31,607 --> 00:51:34,359
past the point
where you can't see...

525
00:51:34,485 --> 00:51:36,945
or be seen from the beach
on either side...

526
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:39,740
which makes witnesses
a little hard to come by.

527
00:51:39,823 --> 00:51:42,326
That's the point
of a romantic swim.

528
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:44,661
Who wants witnesses?

529
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,207
And then?

530
00:51:48,332 --> 00:51:49,291
Then we came back
to the house...

531
00:51:49,374 --> 00:51:50,542
found it on fire.

532
00:51:50,626 --> 00:51:52,461
Just like that?
On fire?

533
00:51:52,586 --> 00:51:53,921
Yes.

534
00:51:54,004 --> 00:51:57,090
And the 5,000 rounds
of spent ammo...

535
00:51:57,216 --> 00:51:58,926
my men found
all around the house?

536
00:51:59,051 --> 00:52:00,427
Maybe they had
the wrong house.

537
00:52:00,511 --> 00:52:01,762
Monsieur Frank...

538
00:52:01,887 --> 00:52:04,681
people with
this kind of firepower...

539
00:52:04,806 --> 00:52:07,893
do not make mistakes
about who they visit.

540
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:10,896
Who would want you this dead?

541
00:52:11,021 --> 00:52:12,731
I don't know.

542
00:52:12,856 --> 00:52:14,566
Any problems with a client?

543
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:16,819
I don't have clients.
I'm retired.

544
00:52:16,902 --> 00:52:19,780
I live on my army pension,
you know that.

545
00:52:19,905 --> 00:52:20,823
You have all the facts
of who I am...

546
00:52:20,906 --> 00:52:22,616
and who I was.
You've had them for years.

547
00:52:22,741 --> 00:52:24,493
Any enemies
you can think of?

548
00:52:24,618 --> 00:52:25,536
People from the past?

549
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,621
I left the past behind
when I moved here.

550
00:52:27,746 --> 00:52:32,501
Huh. A past like yours
you never leave behind.

551
00:52:33,836 --> 00:52:35,462
Commissaire,
on vous demande en bas.

552
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:37,714
I'll just be a moment.

553
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,258
Don't leave.

554
00:52:53,689 --> 00:52:54,648
What are you doing?

555
00:52:54,773 --> 00:52:56,733
Computers know everything.

556
00:52:56,859 --> 00:52:57,901
You just need a password.

557
00:52:58,026 --> 00:53:00,737
What, are you nuts?
We're in a police station.

558
00:53:00,821 --> 00:53:02,197
You're always complaining.

559
00:53:02,322 --> 00:53:04,992
Except when we make love.
Then you say nothing.

560
00:53:18,547 --> 00:53:20,632
Aha.

561
00:53:20,757 --> 00:53:23,218
Ah.

562
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:30,642
# La la la #

563
00:53:30,726 --> 00:53:32,060
Hello.

564
00:53:32,186 --> 00:53:33,604
See?

565
00:53:52,581 --> 00:53:53,874
So, where will you be staying?

566
00:53:53,957 --> 00:53:55,209
I don't know.

567
00:53:55,292 --> 00:53:57,836
Well, my cousin
has a small hotel.

568
00:53:59,129 --> 00:54:01,256
Thanks, but we'll manage.

569
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:04,343
Without money,
it would be hard.

570
00:54:04,468 --> 00:54:05,511
Here.
It's not much...

571
00:54:05,636 --> 00:54:07,721
but at least
you won't go hungry.

572
00:54:07,846 --> 00:54:10,140
Thank you.

573
00:54:22,152 --> 00:54:23,028
Where are you going?

574
00:54:23,153 --> 00:54:24,488
Going to see that guy.

575
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:25,948
Good luck.

576
00:54:26,031 --> 00:54:27,241
One minute.

577
00:54:27,324 --> 00:54:28,617
You're not coming?

578
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,827
No.

579
00:54:29,952 --> 00:54:31,537
But he blew up your car.

580
00:54:31,662 --> 00:54:32,955
I'll buy a new one.

581
00:54:33,038 --> 00:54:34,373
He burned your house.

582
00:54:34,456 --> 00:54:35,541
I'll rebuild it.

583
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:37,042
He tried to kill you!

584
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,794
And as far as he knows,
he succeeded.

585
00:54:38,919 --> 00:54:40,170
Look, I'm going
to give you some advice.

586
00:54:40,254 --> 00:54:41,296
I don't know
what you were into.

587
00:54:41,421 --> 00:54:42,422
I don't care
what you were into.

588
00:54:42,548 --> 00:54:43,423
But whoever wanted you dead...

589
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:44,424
thinks you're dead.

590
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,884
You have a free pass
to start over.

591
00:54:45,968 --> 00:54:48,971
Here's the advice:
Start over!

592
00:54:54,935 --> 00:54:58,564
There are 400 people dying...

593
00:54:58,689 --> 00:55:01,483
in a container on a ship.

594
00:55:04,278 --> 00:55:06,613
My father.

595
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:08,866
My sisters.

596
00:55:08,991 --> 00:55:12,035
The ship arrives today.

597
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:15,330
They will make
my father a slave.

598
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:19,543
The only one who knows
the container number...

599
00:55:19,668 --> 00:55:22,045
is that guy.

600
00:55:22,171 --> 00:55:24,006
You're very good.

601
00:55:24,089 --> 00:55:26,091
What do you mean?

602
00:55:26,175 --> 00:55:28,010
The moment you saw
those pictures in my house...

603
00:55:28,093 --> 00:55:30,179
you were setting me up
to get involved in this.

604
00:55:30,304 --> 00:55:31,346
The breakfast.

605
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:32,931
Giving the excuse
to the cop to help me.

606
00:55:33,056 --> 00:55:35,017
One lie after another.

607
00:55:35,142 --> 00:55:38,896
Not everything is a lie.

608
00:55:38,979 --> 00:55:41,231
Name one thing
that isn't?

609
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:46,487
What happened in the house...

610
00:55:46,612 --> 00:55:47,988
between us...

611
00:55:48,113 --> 00:55:50,866
that was not a lie.

612
00:55:54,036 --> 00:55:55,662
You were a soldier.

613
00:55:55,746 --> 00:55:58,540
Your job was to save people.

614
00:55:58,665 --> 00:56:00,000
Past tense.

615
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:01,460
What does that mean?

616
00:56:01,585 --> 00:56:03,337
It means I got tired
of seeing my best efforts...

617
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,130
get turned into bullshit
by the same people...

618
00:56:05,255 --> 00:56:07,090
who paid me to do the job.

619
00:56:07,174 --> 00:56:08,342
No one cared.

620
00:56:08,425 --> 00:56:12,304
This time... I care.

621
00:56:28,403 --> 00:56:29,863
Thank you.

622
00:56:40,165 --> 00:56:41,124
Bonjour.

623
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,292
Bonjour.

624
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:43,877
No phone calls
for half an hour?

625
00:56:45,087 --> 00:56:46,797
Hello. Surprise!

626
00:56:53,762 --> 00:56:55,013
Sit.

627
00:57:07,651 --> 00:57:08,861
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

628
00:57:10,529 --> 00:57:12,489
So, before we get
to the heart of the matter...

629
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:14,491
I have one question for you.

630
00:57:14,575 --> 00:57:15,868
Why'd you try to kill me?

631
00:57:15,993 --> 00:57:17,369
You lied to me.

632
00:57:17,494 --> 00:57:18,954
You opened the package.

633
00:57:19,037 --> 00:57:20,289
You broke the rules.

634
00:57:20,372 --> 00:57:21,290
Your rules.

635
00:57:21,373 --> 00:57:22,499
What did you
expect me to do...

636
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:24,543
recommend you for another job?

637
00:57:28,088 --> 00:57:29,756
What's the ship number?

638
00:57:32,676 --> 00:57:34,511
Mr. Transporter...

639
00:57:34,636 --> 00:57:35,929
we can both agree...

640
00:57:36,054 --> 00:57:38,015
I answered your first
question politely.

641
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,850
I won't answer any more...

642
00:57:39,975 --> 00:57:43,979
so I suggest
you kill me right now...

643
00:57:44,062 --> 00:57:46,732
and go screw yourself.

644
00:57:48,901 --> 00:57:50,819
I can't find anything.

645
00:57:57,784 --> 00:58:00,329
Oh, poor Frank.
What did she tell you?

646
00:58:00,454 --> 00:58:02,915
We're smuggling people
in containers?

647
00:58:02,998 --> 00:58:05,626
I tell you, "Lai"'s
the perfect name for her.

648
00:58:05,751 --> 00:58:07,127
Secretary, On Intercom:
Mr. Kwai's on the way up.

649
00:58:07,252 --> 00:58:08,128
Your father's here.

650
00:58:08,253 --> 00:58:10,297
He'll really get
a kick out of this.

651
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,965
I thought your father
was in a container.

652
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,884
Yes! I... I mean, no.

653
00:58:14,009 --> 00:58:16,470
There are 400 people
in that container.

654
00:58:17,596 --> 00:58:19,264
Stay where you are!

655
00:58:19,389 --> 00:58:21,850
She's a real heartbreaker,
isn't she, Frank?

656
00:58:24,144 --> 00:58:26,188
10 seconds, 2 choices.

657
00:58:26,271 --> 00:58:28,690
The information on the paper
or your brains on the desk!

658
00:58:28,774 --> 00:58:29,942
Now tell me I'm lying!

659
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:31,527
- 9... 8...
- Lai.

660
00:58:31,652 --> 00:58:33,237
Lai, give me
the gun.

661
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,446
I don't know
what you're talking about.

662
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:36,281
...6... 5...

663
00:58:36,406 --> 00:58:38,116
4... 3...

664
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,117
2...

665
00:58:39,201 --> 00:58:40,494
...one.

666
00:58:40,577 --> 00:58:41,703
Shoot.

667
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:47,084
Lai!

668
00:58:55,175 --> 00:58:58,053
Would I kill
my own daughter?

669
00:58:58,136 --> 00:59:01,056
Lai.

670
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:03,767
Come on now.

671
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:05,060
Put it down.

672
00:59:08,522 --> 00:59:09,982
We'll talk.

673
00:59:10,065 --> 00:59:13,819
She thinks we're smuggling
people in containers.

674
00:59:15,445 --> 00:59:16,697
I don't know where
you get these ideas!

675
00:59:16,822 --> 00:59:17,823
Stay away!

676
00:59:22,452 --> 00:59:25,164
Would you kill
your own father?

677
00:59:25,289 --> 00:59:26,832
Please...

678
00:59:26,957 --> 00:59:28,500
I am begging you.

679
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:30,294
Stop what you are doing.

680
00:59:30,419 --> 00:59:32,129
I do what I do.

681
00:59:32,254 --> 00:59:33,505
I am who I am.

682
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:34,715
I'll never change.

683
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,217
So if you're
going to kill me...

684
00:59:37,301 --> 00:59:38,385
kill me.

685
00:59:38,468 --> 00:59:40,470
But if you don't...

686
00:59:40,596 --> 00:59:41,847
get this gun
out of my face!

687
00:59:45,684 --> 00:59:46,727
Give me.

688
00:59:46,852 --> 00:59:47,811
No!

689
00:59:48,896 --> 00:59:50,314
I know he's innocent.

690
00:59:50,397 --> 00:59:52,191
Oh, you have
such a good heart.

691
00:59:52,316 --> 00:59:55,402
Always interested in
saving innocent people.

692
00:59:55,527 --> 00:59:57,154
Well, here's
your big chance.

693
00:59:57,237 --> 00:59:58,405
Drop your gun...

694
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,991
and you will save one.

695
01:00:06,497 --> 01:00:08,081
- Kill him!
- No!

696
01:00:11,126 --> 01:00:12,544
The police are
on their way up.

697
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:14,129
- What now?
- Take her.

698
01:00:16,507 --> 01:00:17,758
Send in Leo.

699
01:00:17,841 --> 01:00:19,384
I need him to wrap
something up.

700
01:00:35,692 --> 01:00:36,693
Just for the record...

701
01:00:36,819 --> 01:00:38,987
there aren't 400 people
in that container.

702
01:00:39,112 --> 01:00:43,033
Only 395 made it here alive.

703
01:00:43,158 --> 01:00:44,827
Frank!

704
01:00:48,288 --> 01:00:50,374
Inspector.
Am I glad you're here.

705
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,626
What is this?

706
01:00:52,751 --> 01:00:54,670
This man used
my partner's daughter here...

707
01:00:54,795 --> 01:00:56,129
to try and blackmail us.

708
01:00:56,255 --> 01:00:58,799
Luckily, my security
got the drop on him.

709
01:00:59,925 --> 01:01:01,635
I wanna press charges...
kidnapping...

710
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,053
extortion, assault.

711
01:01:03,136 --> 01:01:04,429
I know this man.

712
01:01:04,513 --> 01:01:06,306
Well, I suppose
in your business...

713
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,433
you have to know all types.

714
01:01:10,602 --> 01:01:12,479
Now, should I call my lawyer?

715
01:01:12,604 --> 01:01:14,189
We'll handle it.

716
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:20,988
I'll expect all of you...

717
01:01:21,071 --> 01:01:22,823
down at my office
to give your statements.

718
01:01:22,906 --> 01:01:24,700
As soon as I contact
my lawyer...

719
01:01:24,825 --> 01:01:26,827
we'll be more
than happy to oblige.

720
01:01:46,638 --> 01:01:47,973
The doctor said
you will have a headache...

721
01:01:48,098 --> 01:01:49,850
for a few days
and then everything...

722
01:01:49,975 --> 01:01:51,226
will go back to normal.

723
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:52,269
Where are they?

724
01:01:52,352 --> 01:01:54,897
Ah, I think you should
be more concerned...

725
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:57,232
with where you are.

726
01:01:58,942 --> 01:02:00,736
What got into you?

727
01:02:00,819 --> 01:02:02,321
You were always so careful.

728
01:02:02,404 --> 01:02:03,989
I've got to get out of here.

729
01:02:04,072 --> 01:02:06,366
Oh, well,
with the charges they filed...

730
01:02:06,492 --> 01:02:07,701
you will not be getting out...

731
01:02:07,784 --> 01:02:09,328
for a very long time.

732
01:02:10,454 --> 01:02:11,830
Assaulting a distinguished member...

733
01:02:11,914 --> 01:02:14,374
of the international
business community...

734
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:15,834
kidnapping his daughter...

735
01:02:15,959 --> 01:02:16,835
extortion.

736
01:02:18,003 --> 01:02:19,880
I'm sorry, Frank.

737
01:02:20,005 --> 01:02:21,924
I would like to help you...

738
01:02:22,007 --> 01:02:24,510
but if you continue
with the same old story...

739
01:02:24,635 --> 01:02:27,054
"I am retired,
living on a pension... "

740
01:02:28,555 --> 01:02:30,516
I need fresh, Frank.

741
01:02:30,641 --> 01:02:32,100
I need new.

742
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:34,394
For once,
I need the truth.

743
01:02:37,439 --> 01:02:39,525
OK.

744
01:02:39,608 --> 01:02:41,735
They're smuggling people.

745
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,111
From Asia through Marseilles...

746
01:02:43,237 --> 01:02:44,571
in containers.

747
01:02:47,157 --> 01:02:48,242
You know this for fact?

748
01:02:48,367 --> 01:02:50,327
The girl told me.

749
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:51,537
You believe her?

750
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,163
Yes.

751
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:54,206
In French we have a saying...

752
01:02:54,331 --> 01:02:55,707
"Never believe the cook. "

753
01:02:58,210 --> 01:02:59,169
She's not the cook.

754
01:02:59,253 --> 01:03:00,796
Oh.

755
01:03:00,879 --> 01:03:03,048
I suspected.

756
01:03:03,173 --> 01:03:04,383
You know, Frank...

757
01:03:04,508 --> 01:03:05,467
no one is perfect.

758
01:03:05,551 --> 01:03:06,844
So you're saying
you're gonna do nothing?

759
01:03:06,969 --> 01:03:08,345
No, I'm saying...

760
01:03:08,428 --> 01:03:10,514
I'm going to start
an investigation.

761
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:12,099
And in the meantime,
the 400 people...

762
01:03:12,224 --> 01:03:13,851
in that container
could be dead already.

763
01:03:13,976 --> 01:03:15,894
But what am I
supposed to do?

764
01:03:15,978 --> 01:03:16,937
There are laws.

765
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,272
Did it ever occur
to you that sometimes...

766
01:03:18,397 --> 01:03:19,398
you have to make
your own law?

767
01:03:19,481 --> 01:03:20,524
Like you do?

768
01:03:20,649 --> 01:03:21,942
At least with me,
it doesn't take 12 months...

769
01:03:22,067 --> 01:03:22,943
to get the job done.

770
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:23,944
Oh, yes, I know.

771
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:26,780
That's what I admire
about you, Frank.

772
01:03:26,905 --> 01:03:28,240
All that army training...

773
01:03:28,365 --> 01:03:30,826
all that sneaking around...

774
01:03:30,951 --> 01:03:32,953
a man like you could
probably resolve this case...

775
01:03:33,078 --> 01:03:34,496
in, how long?

776
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,707
12 hours?

777
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:38,000
Less.

778
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:39,585
Less?

779
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:41,378
Impressive.

780
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:43,672
You would be the perfect man
for the job.

781
01:03:43,797 --> 01:03:44,923
Yes...

782
01:03:45,048 --> 01:03:46,383
if I were out.

783
01:03:46,466 --> 01:03:47,384
Yes...

784
01:03:47,467 --> 01:03:49,136
if you were out.

785
01:04:10,032 --> 01:04:11,825
Anybody moves
and I kill him.

786
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:14,244
Personne ne bouge.
Baissez vos armes.

787
01:04:14,369 --> 01:04:16,580
Ce type est dingue
et capable de tout.

788
01:04:24,588 --> 01:04:25,672
# I met him in the Bahamas #

789
01:04:25,756 --> 01:04:27,341
# I love
that nigga persona #

790
01:04:27,466 --> 01:04:28,717
# Smoke
that nigga marijuana #

791
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,344
# Get freaky,
call me Madonna #

792
01:04:30,427 --> 01:04:31,386
# Lay on the bed,
he follow #

793
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,013
# Bone him until tomorrow #

794
01:04:33,096 --> 01:04:34,598
# Make him sing
high soprano #

795
01:04:34,723 --> 01:04:36,016
#Ahh #

796
01:04:36,099 --> 01:04:37,267
# 54-50-50 #

797
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:38,685
# Mr. Act-Super-Kinky #

798
01:04:38,769 --> 01:04:39,811
# Baby,
what you gonna get me #

799
01:04:39,937 --> 01:04:41,563
# Is rings
for my little pinkie #

800
01:04:41,688 --> 01:04:42,815
# Money will multiply #

801
01:04:42,898 --> 01:04:44,191
# Before you run up inside #

802
01:04:44,316 --> 01:04:47,069
# Make me all weak
and tired, mm-hmm #

803
01:04:48,821 --> 01:04:50,614
If this is
how you transport...

804
01:04:50,697 --> 01:04:53,408
I'm amazed you get
any work at all.

805
01:04:53,492 --> 01:04:54,910
Come on and give me a hand.

806
01:05:04,419 --> 01:05:06,004
Maybe I should go with you?

807
01:05:07,506 --> 01:05:08,757
Thanks, but, uh,
I'm better alone.

808
01:05:10,509 --> 01:05:11,802
That is a very small boat...

809
01:05:11,885 --> 01:05:13,387
to fight a very big war.

810
01:05:13,512 --> 01:05:15,347
Yep.

811
01:05:15,472 --> 01:05:16,974
But it's a good boat.

812
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:18,725
Frank, here.

813
01:05:20,269 --> 01:05:21,270
You'll need it.

814
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:26,775
Or maybe not.

815
01:06:54,404 --> 01:06:55,948
The shipment's cleared.

816
01:06:56,031 --> 01:06:57,282
Here's the paperwork.

817
01:06:57,366 --> 01:06:58,617
Take the highway
all the way...

818
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,327
to the first exit... Lyon.

819
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:02,162
Go straight
to the warehouse.

820
01:07:02,246 --> 01:07:04,164
We'll be right behind you
just in case.

821
01:07:21,014 --> 01:07:23,058
OK, we are ready to go.

822
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:30,607
Lai, dear...

823
01:07:39,074 --> 01:07:40,784
I spent thousands of dollars...

824
01:07:40,868 --> 01:07:43,245
for you to go to school
and learn English.

825
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:45,080
The least you can do
is speak it.

826
01:07:45,205 --> 01:07:46,540
I hate you.

827
01:07:50,919 --> 01:07:53,172
I'm still your father.

828
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:56,341
Get her out of here!

829
01:08:16,153 --> 01:08:17,696
Give me a minute.

830
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,058
Keep him alive.

831
01:09:29,685 --> 01:09:30,686
Let's go!

832
01:10:28,535 --> 01:10:29,536
No, don't!

833
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,165
Let's go!

834
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,709
Bitch!

835
01:17:46,538 --> 01:17:47,455
Good morning.

836
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:48,456
Good morning.

837
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:50,498
Oh...

838
01:17:50,581 --> 01:17:52,165
I'm looking to do
a little sightseeing.

839
01:17:52,248 --> 01:17:53,998
This plane is not
for tourists.

840
01:17:56,999 --> 01:17:58,291
I'm not a tourist.

841
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,590
Call this guy
and tell him to meet me.

842
01:18:24,714 --> 01:18:25,590
Sure.

843
01:18:25,715 --> 01:18:27,091
Where?

844
01:18:28,674 --> 01:18:30,091
Down there.

845
01:18:58,890 --> 01:18:59,765
Here!

846
01:19:05,767 --> 01:19:06,642
Careful!

847
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:52,028
Move up.

848
01:20:15,493 --> 01:20:16,743
Get down.

849
01:22:09,188 --> 01:22:10,147
Get closer!

850
01:22:15,315 --> 01:22:16,857
- Steady!
- No, Dad, stop!

851
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:22,692
Get away!

852
01:23:48,588 --> 01:23:50,255
Down!

853
01:24:01,842 --> 01:24:03,051
Hands on your head.

854
01:24:04,468 --> 01:24:05,676
Move!

855
01:24:08,135 --> 01:24:09,344
Watch her.

856
01:24:09,469 --> 01:24:10,928
If she moves
or I don't return...

857
01:24:11,053 --> 01:24:12,386
shoot her!

858
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:16,887
To the water.

859
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:18,763
I'm really not
in the mood for a swim.

860
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:19,763
March!

861
01:24:22,597 --> 01:24:24,764
So, how did
a lowlife like you...

862
01:24:24,847 --> 01:24:26,014
end up with my daughter?

863
01:24:26,139 --> 01:24:28,224
Found her in a bag.
Isn't that where you left her?

864
01:24:28,307 --> 01:24:29,307
You know nothing.

865
01:24:29,432 --> 01:24:30,474
Move!

866
01:24:35,184 --> 01:24:36,476
You got involved
with the wrong girl...

867
01:24:36,559 --> 01:24:37,518
you dumb shit.

868
01:24:37,643 --> 01:24:40,101
The delivery will be made.

869
01:24:40,227 --> 01:24:41,393
My daughter
will get over it.

870
01:24:41,519 --> 01:24:43,852
If I'm lucky,
maybe she'll see the light.

871
01:24:49,729 --> 01:24:52,896
Yeah, if she's lucky
maybe you'll get hit by a truck.

872
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:54,438
What do you know?

873
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:56,564
I know she'll never stop
being who she is...

874
01:24:56,689 --> 01:24:59,273
and she'll never be you
or anything like you.

875
01:24:59,357 --> 01:25:00,815
She'll come around...

876
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:02,524
but you won't be here
to see it.

877
01:25:02,649 --> 01:25:04,149
No!

878
01:25:14,111 --> 01:25:18,444
I guess she won't be
coming around after all.

879
01:25:20,028 --> 01:25:21,195
Turn around!

880
01:25:21,278 --> 01:25:22,779
I'd rather see it coming.

881
01:25:22,862 --> 01:25:24,696
Makes no difference to me.

882
01:25:50,327 --> 01:25:52,537
He was a bastard...

883
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:55,287
but he was still
my father.

884
01:26:09,499 --> 01:26:11,291
Pretty impressive timing, Frank.

885
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,501
I guess I underestimated you.
