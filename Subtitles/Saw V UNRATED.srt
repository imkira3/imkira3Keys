1
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,793
What the...? What the fuck?

2
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:48,087
What the...?

3
00:01:49,337 --> 00:01:51,338
What the fuck!

4
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:52,839
Fuck.

5
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:56,173
Hello?

6
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:59,050
Fuck.

7
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:07,136
Hello, Seth.

8
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:09,679
I wanna play a game.

9
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:11,972
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

10
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:13,972
- This is the same helplessness...
- Help!

11
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:16,057
...you've bestowed onto others.

12
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:18,349
But now it's onto you.

13
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:22,351
Some call this karma. I call it justice.

14
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,519
Now, you served five years...

15
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,603
...of what should have been
a life sentence for murder.

16
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,896
A technicality gave you freedom...

17
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:35,190
...but it inhibited you from understanding
the impact of taking a life.

18
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:38,399
Today, I offer you true freedom.

19
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:44,068
In 30 seconds, the pendulum will drop
far enough to touch your body.

20
00:02:44,193 --> 00:02:48,570
Within sixty seconds
it will cut you in half.

21
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:54,698
To avoid the pendulum, all you have to do
is destroy the things that have killed:

22
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:56,490
Your hands.

23
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:58,366
You must insert your hands...

24
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,659
...and push the buttons
to start the devices before you.

25
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:04,452
Your bones will be crushed to dust.

26
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:08,662
Will you destroy the things that have
taken life in order to save one, Seth?

27
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,996
Make your choice.

28
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:14,998
No.

29
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:40,592
It was an accident!

30
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:47,887
Please.

31
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:55,348
Okay. Fuck you.

32
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:11,772
Okay. Okay. Okay.

33
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,642
I did what I was supposed to do.

34
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,487
SAW V

35
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:11,905
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your fucking hands.

36
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,697
Where is my daughter? You...

37
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:25,994
Jesus.

38
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,030
Hello, Agent Strahm.

39
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:55,948
If you're hearing this, then you've
finally found what you've been looking for.

40
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:59,617
But is the discovery
of my body enough?

41
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:06,036
Or will your insatiable hunger to uncover
the truth push you deeper into the abyss?

42
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:09,621
Heed my warning: Do not proceed.

43
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:15,415
For this room can either be
your sanctuary or it can be your grave.

44
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,707
The choice is yours.

45
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,751
Fuck you.

46
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,446
Hey!

47
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:55,748
Help!

48
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:23,035
Go! Go!

49
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,953
You're okay.

50
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:35,415
- Where's my dad?
- He's gonna be okay.

51
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,249
Where's my mom?
Where's my mom?

52
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:41,584
Hoffman.
I got it. I got it.

53
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:44,877
You okay to walk?

54
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,253
What the hell, man?
What happened? Where's Rigg?

55
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,172
Tried to help. He didn't make it.

56
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,464
Nobody made it.

57
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,174
We got a live one.

58
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:38,983
Hello?

59
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:40,734
Right away.

60
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:42,693
Ms. Tuck.

61
00:12:43,026 --> 00:12:44,485
Have a seat.

62
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:50,821
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Feldman.

63
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,114
Why am I here?

64
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,865
I represent your ex-husband, John.

65
00:12:56,073 --> 00:13:00,409
In the event of his death,
I was instructed to contact you.

66
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:05,494
You can understand my surprise
when I found out who he really was.

67
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,703
John left something for you.

68
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:34,381
If you're watching this, Jill,
I'm long gone from this world.

69
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:40,592
You are my heart, you always have been.
You always will be.

70
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:47,178
I'm not going to try to explain
my actions of late.

71
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:51,680
Suffice it to say that I find it difficult
to forgive myself...

72
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,514
...for what happened at the clinic.

73
00:13:54,223 --> 00:14:00,434
I permitted, indeed, encouraged
your decisions regarding the people there.

74
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:04,894
I saw danger and I...
I should have acted sooner.

75
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:11,271
I'm leaving you a box today,
and its contents are of grave importance.

76
00:14:11,897 --> 00:14:15,398
Even though you and I don't always see
eye to eye on everything...

77
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:19,066
...I deeply believe in you
and I believe that you will know...

78
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,609
...what to do with these materials.

79
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,802
I wanna thank you all
for coming here today.

80
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:28,095
And I'd like to be the first to say...

81
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,221
...that the Jigsaw murders are over.

82
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:36,849
The officers who gave their lives
are being honored here today.

83
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:40,392
But today I'd like to offer
a special honor...

84
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:43,935
...to the detective who's been on this case
right from the beginning...

85
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,687
...who proved through hard work
and dedication...

86
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:51,188
...that the people who died
did not die in vain.

87
00:15:51,313 --> 00:15:55,732
Today we honor the newly promoted
Detective Lieutenant...

88
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:58,024
...Mark Hoffman.

89
00:15:58,108 --> 00:15:59,692
Congratulations.

90
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:01,692
Thank you so much.

91
00:16:10,113 --> 00:16:11,822
Thank you. Thank you very much.

92
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:14,114
Uh, ahem...

93
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:18,991
Throughout this ordeal,
if we've learned anything it's that...

94
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:20,992
...human life is sacred.

95
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:24,910
And we've learned that every day...

96
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,287
...life should be cherished.

97
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,830
Justice...

98
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:35,040
...is the backbone
to every peaceful society.

99
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:39,458
And I believe that true justice
has been served.

100
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:47,445
Detective Hoffman,
you're wanted at the hospital.

101
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:49,195
It's about Agent Perez.

102
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:51,113
Thank you.

103
00:17:54,739 --> 00:18:00,659
Hello, Agent Perez, and welcome
to the world that you have long studied.

104
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:02,826
Heed my warning, Agent Perez.

105
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:06,078
Your next move is critical.

106
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:08,120
- Open the door.
What is that?

107
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,081
I got you.

108
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,925
I'm truly sorry about Agent Perez.

109
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:44,135
She said your name, you know.

110
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:47,762
The last thing she said
was "Detective Hoffman. "

111
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:51,263
Why'd she say that?
Why'd she say your name?

112
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:53,681
- I don't know.
- No?

113
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:56,932
How'd you walk out of that building?

114
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,558
How did you?

115
00:18:58,641 --> 00:19:01,226
On a gurney with a fucking hole
in my throat.

116
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:04,894
Look at you.

117
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,228
Couple of scratches and a story
about how your arm straps broke.

118
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:10,271
Jigsaw doesn't make mistakes.

119
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:12,980
Is this you theorizing again?
Because Jigsaw's dead.

120
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:17,065
I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about
you and your whole crooked department.

121
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:20,233
My department's gone. They're all dead.
There's no one left.

122
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,026
Besides you.

123
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,944
Been chasing Jigsaw
from the beginning...

124
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:27,945
...and I got him.

125
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:30,238
So unless you've got
something else to say...

126
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:33,072
...back the fuck off.

127
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:37,157
Read the papers.
I saved that little girl.

128
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:55,248
Sorry about Agent Perez.

129
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,333
Shouldn't you be resting?

130
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,125
I'm fine, Erickson.

131
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:04,669
No, you're not, Peter.
That's why I put you on medical leave.

132
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,463
I was supposed to die in that trap.

133
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:13,547
You never should have been there
without backup.

134
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,549
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

135
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,300
You're no longer handling
the case, Peter.

136
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:22,343
What?

137
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:23,968
Read it.

138
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:30,554
Over a dozen dead bodies were recovered
at the scene, two of which were cops.

139
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,223
Jigsaw's dead, how many lives
did I inevitably save?

140
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:36,599
By endangering yourself and others.

141
00:20:36,765 --> 00:20:37,974
You're off the case.

142
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:39,892
On whose orders?

143
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:41,476
Mine.

144
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,477
I'm sorry, Peter. It's over.

145
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:26,019
Oh, my God.

146
00:22:30,354 --> 00:22:31,563
Oh...

147
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:34,398
- What is this?
- Hey, don't move.

148
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:36,398
What did you do to me?

149
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,607
I didn't do anything.

150
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,775
- It's Jigsaw.
- What?

151
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,401
I knew this was gonna happen
to me. This is what he does.

152
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:45,986
No, it's not Jigsaw.

153
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:49,487
He's dead.

154
00:22:49,612 --> 00:22:51,905
Haven't you watched TV lately?

155
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:54,198
Yeah, well, whoever it is...

156
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:56,073
...they're watching us.

157
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:02,576
To make sure we follow the rules.

158
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:05,160
- Which are what?
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

159
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:07,745
Unless you want your head
to pop off like a dandelion.

160
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,496
- How do you know that?
- Because I have eyes.

161
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:14,081
One pull-pin starts the timer
for all of us.

162
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,000
You won't wanna do that unless
you know how it works, now, would you?

163
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,543
You're starting to freak me out, dude.

164
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:28,212
Hello, and welcome.

165
00:23:28,504 --> 00:23:33,089
From birth, you've all been given
the advantages of few others.

166
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:36,007
Yet through poor moral decisions...

167
00:23:36,173 --> 00:23:39,175
...you've used these advantages
to selfishly further...

168
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:43,010
...only yourselves
at the expense of others.

169
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:46,803
Well, today this singular way of thinking
will be put to the test.

170
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:52,097
Today, five will become one,
with a common goal of survival.

171
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,389
You are all connected.

172
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:55,973
A cable runs through
your collar devices.

173
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,891
It can be pulled so tight...

174
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:00,850
...that you will be decapitated
on the mounted razors.

175
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:06,394
The only way to remove the collar
is with the keys from the glass boxes...

176
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,103
...on the pedestals before you.

177
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,396
However, if one of you moves
to retrieve a key...

178
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:14,981
...the 60-second timer
will begin for you all.

179
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:17,607
In choosing how to react
to this situation...

180
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:20,817
...your lifelong instincts
will tell you to do one thing...

181
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:24,193
...but I implore you to do the opposite.

182
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:26,986
Let the games begin.

183
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:32,822
Somebody has to die.

184
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:36,615
No, no, no, it says,
"Don't listen to your instincts. "

185
00:24:36,824 --> 00:24:39,200
- That means don't go for the keys.
- You fucking nuts?

186
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:41,409
How are we supposed to live
if we don't?

187
00:24:41,492 --> 00:24:43,785
- It's testing our endurance.
- We gotta move, babe.

188
00:24:43,993 --> 00:24:46,036
That timer's connected to those jars.

189
00:24:46,203 --> 00:24:48,078
It didn't say anything
about those jars.

190
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:50,371
- They could be nothing.
They're nail bombs.

191
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:52,414
Homemade, probably C-4.

192
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:54,248
How the fuck do you know that?

193
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:57,624
She's a fire inspector.
She's seen all kinds of demented shit.

194
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:59,750
How do you know me?

195
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,044
Hey, man, she's asking you a question.
How do you know her?

196
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:11,130
How do you know her? Answer me!

197
00:25:11,296 --> 00:25:13,547
Look, let's just keep our cool.

198
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:16,924
- Okay, we can figure this out.
- We're all here for a reason.

199
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:20,717
Okay, and we're all connected,
as the message said.

200
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:22,468
We just need to...

201
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:27,720
- What did you do?
- You go first.

202
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,014
It said that we were all born
with advantages.

203
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:36,515
Right? That means
we're all from money.

204
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,226
- I'm not.
- And neither am I.

205
00:25:41,351 --> 00:25:44,143
Hey, nice fucking try, Nancy Drew.

206
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,103
Well, then, what does it mean?

207
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,895
We did something wrong
with an advantage from birth.

208
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,647
- That doesn't have to mean money.
- What are you not telling us? Huh?

209
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,065
You know about her, what do you know
about the rest of us?

210
00:25:56,315 --> 00:25:58,900
Would you fucking talk to me?

211
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,984
- Relax.
- I am fucking relaxed.

212
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:04,318
It's a game, tweaker.

213
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:09,029
Get it? The less you know about me,
the better.

214
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,238
The reason why you fucked up
your charmed existence...

215
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,656
...is pretty obvious to everyone, isn't it?

216
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,324
Fuck you. Fuck you.

217
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:20,742
Been playing with matches again,
have we?

218
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:23,201
Fuck all of you and your fucking plan.

219
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:12,330
Unless you wanna be shredded
when those bombs go off...

220
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:15,248
...I suggest we move on.

221
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,090
What are you doing?

222
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,133
Being smart.

223
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,221
Special Agent Strahm's office.

224
00:28:50,346 --> 00:28:54,139
This is Detective Hoffman.
Is Agent Strahm available?

225
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:56,974
He's not, but I can connect you
to Special Agent Erickson.

226
00:28:57,182 --> 00:28:58,683
He's handling all inquiries.

227
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,267
Please.

228
00:29:02,351 --> 00:29:04,769
You've reached
the voice mail box of Agent Erickson.

229
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:06,936
Please leave a message.

230
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:09,646
Yeah, this is Detective Hoffman.

231
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:12,313
I needed to discuss something
with Agent Strahm...

232
00:29:12,564 --> 00:29:14,439
...but I can't seem to track him down.

233
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:17,982
Could you give me a call?
It would be greatly appreciated.

234
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:20,425
There you are.

235
00:31:07,903 --> 00:31:10,071
Sister.

236
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,792
Peter.

237
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:47,712
- Cowan, take this to analysis.
- Right away, sir.

238
00:31:49,837 --> 00:31:51,088
What are you doing here?

239
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:55,798
Just grabbing some stuff from the office.
I'm taking your advice.

240
00:31:56,632 --> 00:32:00,217
- Taking some time off, huh?
- Yeah, well, I have to heal up, you know.

241
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:01,467
Mm-hm.

242
00:32:01,717 --> 00:32:04,802
You know, I'll keep in touch.
I'll see you around.

243
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:36,424
Hoffman.

244
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:40,383
We got another body.
Looks like another Jigsaw victim.

245
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:43,718
- You up for this?
- Yeah.

246
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:46,303
Typical bio. Murder convict.

247
00:33:46,428 --> 00:33:49,095
Served five years,
just released last month.

248
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:54,139
I know him.

249
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:56,765
His name's Seth Baxter.

250
00:33:57,224 --> 00:33:59,516
My sister's ex-boyfriend.

251
00:34:00,975 --> 00:34:03,435
This is the guy
that murdered your sister?

252
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:08,687
He was sentenced to 25 years.
Got it reduced to five on a technicality.

253
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:12,730
Well, then I'd say justice was served.

254
00:34:22,484 --> 00:34:26,611
You killed him.
Made it look like a Jigsaw trap.

255
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:30,821
I got you.

256
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:39,450
Not yet.
- Don't close the door. It'll set off the timer.

257
00:34:39,617 --> 00:34:42,118
Do you know that for sure?
Educated guess.

258
00:34:42,284 --> 00:34:44,452
What we need to do
is figure out who everyone is.

259
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,203
Okay, well, we know that the dead woman
worked for the fire department.

260
00:34:48,328 --> 00:34:50,746
Not anymore.
She got canned a month ago.

261
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:53,456
How the fuck do you...?
How the fuck do you know that?

262
00:34:53,622 --> 00:34:56,415
You're responsible for this?
She had her fucking head cut off!

263
00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:57,791
I'm closing the door.

264
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:00,625
- I'm gonna close the fucking door!
- Just be quiet.

265
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,627
Please.

266
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:08,879
What's your story?

267
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:11,130
I work for
the Department of City Planning.

268
00:35:11,296 --> 00:35:14,631
- Married? Kids?
- No, and no.

269
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:18,424
- Your turn.
- You're not gonna tell them about Daddy?

270
00:35:21,426 --> 00:35:25,719
- My dad is Richard Gibbs.
- The owner of the Cougars?

271
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:30,263
He's been trying to build a new stadium
for years. Little did he know...

272
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:35,723
...all he had to do is wait for his daughter
to get a job in City Planning.

273
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:39,642
And you. What about you?

274
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:42,018
What sort of shady shit
have you been up to?

275
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:45,019
I'm a senior V.P.
For a real estate development company.

276
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,603
So you're boring too. Hmm?

277
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:53,105
The Marshvard Group.
Yeah, you can't get a permit in this town...

278
00:35:53,231 --> 00:35:56,357
...without going through
the Department of City Planning.

279
00:35:56,565 --> 00:35:59,191
- Right?
- No, you can't.

280
00:35:59,316 --> 00:36:01,025
What about you?

281
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,526
Uh...

282
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:04,652
No wife.

283
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:10,529
- No kids that I know of. No job.
- Trust-fund baby. Anyone surprised?

284
00:36:10,654 --> 00:36:13,030
I'm so fucking sick of
your self-righteousness.

285
00:36:13,197 --> 00:36:14,364
It's your turn.

286
00:36:14,531 --> 00:36:19,408
I'm an investigative journalist
for The Herald.

287
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:22,910
Herald? That's your accomplishment?
You work for a gossip rag?

288
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,952
Bite your fucking tongue.

289
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,620
What the hell are in those jars?

290
00:36:28,704 --> 00:36:32,247
Let's do this fucking thing
before the bombs go off.

291
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,208
Fuck!

292
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:44,043
Hello, and welcome to the next lesson.

293
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,336
These walls hold four chambers.

294
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:50,963
These chambers are for safety.

295
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:53,964
However, to access them,
a key is needed.

296
00:36:54,048 --> 00:36:57,716
But only three of the keys
will fit the locks.

297
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:01,634
These keys are in the glass jars
hanging from the ceiling.

298
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:04,969
Move quickly, though,
because when the clock ticks down...

299
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:09,846
...the explosives in the corners
of the room will detonate.

300
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:14,681
With only three points of safety,
which of you will be the odd man out?

301
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,974
Make your choice.

302
00:37:20,225 --> 00:37:21,434
Fuck.

303
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:31,021
Fuck, it's blank. I need a shape.

304
00:37:33,981 --> 00:37:36,398
Get your hands off that,
you're not going anywhere.

305
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:41,401
- Stop it!
Get a clue, you fucking bitch.

306
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,568
It's survival of the fittest.

307
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:00,700
Blank.

308
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:03,243
Blank.

309
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:07,995
Shit.

310
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:10,663
I got it. Got it.

311
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,585
Yes.

312
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:34,173
Better luck next time, rich boy.

313
00:38:36,215 --> 00:38:38,049
Survival of the fittest, my ass!

314
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:53,180
Wait.

315
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:20,400
Everything all right with
Detective Kerr in the Seth Baxter case?

316
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:21,651
- Yeah.
- Good.

317
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,735
Fisk. You keep me posted.

318
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,445
- Will do.
- Good.

319
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:32,280
After Seth,
you were involved in every investigation.

320
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:42,910
When did you first meet Jigsaw?

321
00:40:47,186 --> 00:40:49,479
Stop it, stop it!

322
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:01,692
Don't!

323
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:09,446
Heel! Heel, I said!

324
00:41:09,696 --> 00:41:11,571
Don't provoke him. Asshole!

325
00:41:12,655 --> 00:41:15,782
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Peewee. Come on.

326
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,283
- Come on, Peewee.
- Peewee.

327
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:19,908
Shit.

328
00:41:23,993 --> 00:41:26,119
Do you mind?

329
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:34,373
Going up?
- Yes, thank you.

330
00:41:55,673 --> 00:41:57,716
What floor are you going to?

331
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:11,430
I think we're both going
to the same place.

332
00:42:43,443 --> 00:42:45,861
You know why you're here, don't you?

333
00:42:48,028 --> 00:42:52,489
They say imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery.

334
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:57,741
But I find it somewhat distasteful...

335
00:42:57,907 --> 00:43:00,700
...to be given credit for work
that's not mine.

336
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:08,704
Especially inferior work.

337
00:43:13,622 --> 00:43:17,165
Like you,
I know what it's like to lose family.

338
00:43:18,624 --> 00:43:22,001
I know what it's like
not to be able to protect loved ones.

339
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:25,502
It's a powerless feeling.

340
00:43:30,754 --> 00:43:31,880
I wouldn't do that.

341
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:39,425
Hair trigger.

342
00:43:42,343 --> 00:43:44,135
What do you see?

343
00:43:45,511 --> 00:43:47,011
Hm?

344
00:43:47,928 --> 00:43:50,971
Vengeance can change a person.
Make you into something...

345
00:43:51,013 --> 00:43:54,014
...you never thought
you were capable of being.

346
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,016
But unlike you, I've never killed anyone.

347
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:02,518
- I give people a chance.
- You call this a chance?

348
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:04,644
We'll see.

349
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:10,938
- Our game's just begun.
- Our game? You don't even know me.

350
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:12,564
Oh.

351
00:44:12,897 --> 00:44:17,732
I know you.
l’ve followed you as you've pursued me.

352
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:21,067
I know you. I know about your sister.

353
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:23,652
I know how you cared for her.

354
00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:32,030
I know she was your only family.

355
00:44:32,197 --> 00:44:34,031
Leave me alone.

356
00:44:37,532 --> 00:44:38,908
No!

357
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:50,663
You sit in bars until closing.
You drink so you can sleep.

358
00:44:50,871 --> 00:44:52,414
You stagger to your car...

359
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:56,665
...and then you start it all over again
the next day.

360
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:03,335
Then I discovered
what you do for recreation.

361
00:45:07,753 --> 00:45:09,296
Mm.

362
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:11,672
You can dispense justice...

363
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:15,965
...and give people a chance
to value their lives in the same moment.

364
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,466
And by the way...

365
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,718
...the blade on your pendulum
was inferior.

366
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,053
If you want a true edge...

367
00:45:30,138 --> 00:45:32,347
...you have to used tempered steel.

368
00:45:32,555 --> 00:45:35,556
Tempering's better for the long haul.

369
00:45:35,682 --> 00:45:37,724
You in this for the long haul, detective?

370
00:45:39,225 --> 00:45:42,559
l’ve been a cop for 20 years.
Is that long enough for you?

371
00:45:42,726 --> 00:45:46,728
Then you and I both know the statistics
for repeat offenders in this city.

372
00:45:46,936 --> 00:45:52,022
67.5 percent of criminals
are back in prison within three years.

373
00:45:52,147 --> 00:45:53,647
What do you want from me?

374
00:45:54,314 --> 00:45:57,857
So you might look at what you did to Seth
as a kind of public service.

375
00:45:59,566 --> 00:46:02,693
She was my only family.
He didn't deserve a chance.

376
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:05,486
- He was an animal.
- Everybody deserves a chance!

377
00:46:05,652 --> 00:46:07,528
You didn't see the blood!

378
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:09,946
You didn't see
what he fucking did to her!

379
00:46:10,113 --> 00:46:13,614
Killing is distasteful...

380
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,699
...to me.

381
00:46:19,783 --> 00:46:23,952
There is a better, more efficient way.

382
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,539
What do you see...? Look!

383
00:46:34,956 --> 00:46:38,166
- What do you see?
- Tell me what you want.

384
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:44,585
I wanna know if you have
what it takes to survive.

385
00:47:04,052 --> 00:47:07,553
Fuck you.

386
00:47:09,596 --> 00:47:12,138
You see, it's a different method
that I'm talking about.

387
00:47:12,722 --> 00:47:14,806
If a subject survives my method...

388
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,766
...he or she is instantly rehabilitated.

389
00:47:19,725 --> 00:47:21,851
Now, you want a chance?

390
00:47:23,351 --> 00:47:24,935
You want a chance?

391
00:47:25,185 --> 00:47:26,311
I'll give you a chance.

392
00:47:34,773 --> 00:47:37,774
I'm the man you call Jigsaw.

393
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:41,651
It's your duty to bring me in...

394
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,652
...but I know who you are...

395
00:47:44,777 --> 00:47:47,236
...and I know what you’ve done.

396
00:47:51,155 --> 00:47:52,572
So this is blackmail.

397
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:53,781
No, no, no.

398
00:47:55,156 --> 00:47:57,491
This is redemption.

399
00:48:01,534 --> 00:48:04,619
Just giving you an option, that's all.

400
00:48:05,286 --> 00:48:07,745
Now, you can arrest me...

401
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,038
...but doing so,
your life ends as you know it.

402
00:48:12,163 --> 00:48:13,539
Or...

403
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:15,165
...you could explore...

404
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:18,791
...a method of rehabilitation...

405
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:21,334
...that'll permit you to sleep at night.

406
00:48:42,968 --> 00:48:44,677
Or I could kill you right now.

407
00:48:44,802 --> 00:48:47,136
But you're not a true killer.

408
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:49,387
That's your dilemma...

409
00:48:49,554 --> 00:48:53,055
...and the information that I have on you
is exactly where it needs to be...

410
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,349
...and it will be released
in the event of my disappearance.

411
00:48:58,058 --> 00:49:00,600
They'll never believe your word
over mine.

412
00:49:03,185 --> 00:49:05,227
You willing to take that risk?

413
00:49:05,477 --> 00:49:07,603
Risk of ruining your own life...

414
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,188
...in order to protect
a corrupt legal system...

415
00:49:10,354 --> 00:49:13,939
...that puts murderers
back on the streets?

416
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:21,776
How would your sister feel?

417
00:49:21,901 --> 00:49:24,027
You're at a crossroads, detective.

418
00:49:24,652 --> 00:49:26,778
Make your choice.

419
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:51,413
Did you help Jigsaw get all of them?

420
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:42,018
Detective Hoffman,
this is Special Agent Erickson.

421
00:50:42,184 --> 00:50:45,811
You had something you needed to discuss
about the Jigsaw case?

422
00:50:45,977 --> 00:50:50,396
Yes. I stopped by Agent Strahm's room
tonight at the hospital, but he wasn't there.

423
00:50:50,521 --> 00:50:52,814
- I hope he's all right.
- Oh, yeah, he's fine.

424
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,398
Agent Strahm was theorizing
about the possibility...

425
00:50:55,523 --> 00:50:58,774
...of an additional accomplice
to Jigsaw, other than Amanda Young.

426
00:50:59,566 --> 00:51:02,526
Someone who might be
currently unknown.

427
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:05,402
Did he ever mention
anything like that to you?

428
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:07,695
No, but then again, I'm new to the case.

429
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:11,613
Yeah, well, maybe you could get him
to contact me at his earliest convenience.

430
00:51:11,822 --> 00:51:14,156
Will do. And...

431
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:16,449
...in your theorizing...

432
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,116
...who exactly did you suspect
would be an accomplice?

433
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:23,326
Well, he suspected
someone on the inside.

434
00:51:23,576 --> 00:51:24,702
Someone with access.

435
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:27,203
It's an interesting theory.

436
00:51:27,453 --> 00:51:30,704
Detective, what do you say we reconnect
in the morning?

437
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,747
You got it.

438
00:52:16,057 --> 00:52:17,432
Dead.

439
00:52:17,641 --> 00:52:20,392
That guy was an asshole,
but he was smart.

440
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,726
We could've used him.

441
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:24,602
Yeah, well, someone had to die.

442
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:28,729
Would you rather it'd been you?

443
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,421
How'd they get you?

444
00:54:40,534 --> 00:54:41,867
Screw you!

445
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:45,827
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

446
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,289
I'm gonna kill...

447
00:55:36,932 --> 00:55:39,058
Hello, Paul.

448
00:55:39,225 --> 00:55:42,268
Did you cut yourself
because you truly wanted to die...

449
00:55:42,434 --> 00:55:46,228
...or did you just want some attention?

450
00:55:46,353 --> 00:55:48,020
Tonight, you'll show me.

451
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:52,313
If you want to live,
you'll have to cut yourself again.

452
00:55:53,772 --> 00:55:57,732
How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Paul?

453
00:56:48,253 --> 00:56:51,255
I didn't expect to feel any remorse.

454
00:56:51,797 --> 00:56:53,714
The heart cannot be involved.

455
00:56:53,922 --> 00:56:57,049
Emotionally, there can be nothing there.

456
00:56:57,174 --> 00:56:59,883
It can never be personal.

457
00:57:00,258 --> 00:57:02,676
- Let's go.
- No.

458
00:57:02,843 --> 00:57:04,969
You're not done yet.

459
00:57:05,094 --> 00:57:10,263
Tonight you will see the difference
between killing and rehabilitation.

460
00:57:22,518 --> 00:57:26,186
There is another detective
that you should be aware of.

461
00:57:26,353 --> 00:57:28,062
His name's Tapp.

462
00:57:28,187 --> 00:57:30,646
He's smart, and he's getting closer.

463
00:57:30,771 --> 00:57:32,939
I know who he is.

464
00:57:36,857 --> 00:57:40,192
I need you to lead him
to someone for me.

465
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,360
A doctor.

466
00:57:45,486 --> 00:57:48,695
A healer who needs some healing.

467
00:57:52,363 --> 00:57:54,781
Is this yours, doctor?

468
00:58:02,243 --> 00:58:05,827
You supplied these police files,
didn't you?

469
00:58:37,549 --> 00:58:40,884
You're assuming this is gonna play out
the way you want it.

470
00:58:41,009 --> 00:58:43,093
I assume nothing.

471
00:58:47,803 --> 00:58:53,597
I anticipate the possibilities,
and I let the game play out.

472
00:58:54,014 --> 00:58:56,849
Then why do you need Amanda
in the game?

473
00:58:59,516 --> 00:59:02,768
To ensure that the rules are followed.

474
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:08,145
She won't make decisions for anyone.
She'll just...

475
00:59:09,396 --> 00:59:11,521
...offer choices.

476
00:59:13,439 --> 00:59:15,565
Little to your left.

477
00:59:23,401 --> 00:59:25,819
That leaves a lot to chance.

478
00:59:40,784 --> 00:59:44,577
If you're good
at anticipating the human mind...

479
00:59:50,204 --> 00:59:53,080
...it leaves nothing to chance.

480
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,795
It's time.

481
01:00:25,469 --> 01:00:27,887
Jesus Christ.

482
01:00:32,722 --> 01:00:35,306
Great. More bombs.

483
01:00:39,058 --> 01:00:41,892
All right. What'd you do to get here?

484
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:46,644
L... I did something,
and a bunch of people were killed.

485
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:48,520
I didn't mean to.

486
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,897
They're still dead.

487
01:00:52,022 --> 01:00:53,939
- That's why you're here?
- Yeah.

488
01:00:54,189 --> 01:00:57,149
Shouldn't you have
gone to jail for something like that?

489
01:00:57,316 --> 01:00:59,316
Nobody else knows.

490
01:01:03,902 --> 01:01:05,277
Somebody does.

491
01:01:15,198 --> 01:01:17,699
I didn't kill anybody,
if that's what you're asking.

492
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:19,241
I wasn't.

493
01:01:20,742 --> 01:01:22,784
I grant building permits.

494
01:01:25,744 --> 01:01:28,954
And yeah, some people might have been
more deserving than others...

495
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,121
...but you know what?
That's the business.

496
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:34,123
So if someone tells you different,
then they're just stupid.

497
01:01:34,206 --> 01:01:36,790
Or naive. Or both.

498
01:01:36,915 --> 01:01:38,124
Bullshit.

499
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:42,209
You take bribes. You're a fucking liar.
You cheat people. That's not nice.

500
01:01:42,334 --> 01:01:43,960
Yeah, well.

501
01:01:44,127 --> 01:01:47,503
I'm sure she's not exactly
Mother Teresa either.

502
01:01:47,712 --> 01:01:49,337
No, I'm not.

503
01:01:50,213 --> 01:01:53,839
I build condos in one of the most
densely populated cities in the country.

504
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:57,632
You don't put up a new building
without tearing down a few old ones.

505
01:01:57,841 --> 01:02:01,384
So we're all bags of shit that deserve
to be here. That's good. That's great.

506
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:02,593
Fucking great.

507
01:02:02,843 --> 01:02:05,135
So is that what you think this is?

508
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:07,303
You don't think there's
any other connection?

509
01:02:07,553 --> 01:02:09,346
No, I do.

510
01:02:09,554 --> 01:02:11,847
I do. And I don't give a shit.

511
01:02:12,013 --> 01:02:15,098
Close the fucking door.
We have to hear the rules.

512
01:02:26,228 --> 01:02:27,687
Hello, and welcome.

513
01:02:27,812 --> 01:02:33,439
You must all be eager to learn the next
important lesson in your transformation.

514
01:02:33,606 --> 01:02:38,316
The game before you is designed
to bridge the gap between you all.

515
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:42,109
In order to open the five locks
on the door out of this room...

516
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:46,111
...the five electrical circuits
powering them must be closed.

517
01:02:46,278 --> 01:02:53,030
The only way to do this is to find a way
to connect all five cords to the bath water.

518
01:02:53,155 --> 01:02:56,407
Close the circuits
and the door will open.

519
01:02:56,532 --> 01:02:57,782
But you must work quickly...

520
01:02:58,033 --> 01:03:01,534
...for in three minutes, an electrical current
will surge through this room...

521
01:03:01,701 --> 01:03:04,452
...locking the door forever.

522
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:08,829
Who will bridge the gap?
The choice is yours.

523
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,664
Jesus Christ.

524
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:21,917
It's not gonna reach.
How the fuck are we gonna do this?

525
01:03:22,126 --> 01:03:23,668
Come on!

526
01:03:25,544 --> 01:03:27,712
You're gonna get in the tub...

527
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,754
...and we're gonna connect the five cords
to you.

528
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:32,297
But you're gonna kill me too.

529
01:03:34,423 --> 01:03:37,007
- Get in.
- Yeah, I'm more of a shower guy.

530
01:03:37,132 --> 01:03:40,342
- I don't think I'm gonna do that right now.
- Get in the fucking tub.

531
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:43,051
Fuck you, you bitch.
You get in the fucking tub.

532
01:03:44,552 --> 01:03:46,011
No, don't do it.

533
01:03:46,178 --> 01:03:47,928
Please, no.

534
01:03:58,558 --> 01:04:01,684
You killed her.
You fucking killed her.

535
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:03,727
I didn't trust her.

536
01:04:03,852 --> 01:04:06,561
Jesus Christ. What is it with you two?

537
01:04:06,769 --> 01:04:09,229
Just shut up and help me with the body.

538
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:29,862
Hey, hey. No.
Don't let your body touch hers.

539
01:04:57,957 --> 01:05:00,083
Oh, my God, it's a hook.

540
01:05:03,335 --> 01:05:06,044
Stick it in her head or we don't get out.

541
01:05:09,045 --> 01:05:11,005
Just do it

542
01:05:31,263 --> 01:05:32,764
Come in.

543
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:37,057
Sir. It's Jill Tuck.

544
01:05:37,182 --> 01:05:38,933
Good evening.

545
01:05:39,058 --> 01:05:40,267
Special Agent Erickson.

546
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:42,351
Thank you for seeing me
so late in the day.

547
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:43,685
Not a problem.

548
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,436
That'll be all.

549
01:05:46,895 --> 01:05:49,479
Please, have a seat.

550
01:05:50,729 --> 01:05:54,189
So, what do you need from us?

551
01:05:54,856 --> 01:05:57,065
I think I'm being followed.

552
01:05:57,274 --> 01:05:59,566
Well, that sounds more like
police work, Miss Tuck.

553
01:06:01,192 --> 01:06:03,360
I don't think they can help me.

554
01:06:03,652 --> 01:06:07,528
- Because?
- Because it's you. The FBI.

555
01:06:09,446 --> 01:06:10,946
I don't understand.

556
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,323
It started when John was first identified
as the Jigsaw killer.

557
01:06:14,573 --> 01:06:17,241
It didn't surprise me then,
but I'm still being followed.

558
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:20,992
By who, Miss Tuck?
Who would be following you?

559
01:06:21,075 --> 01:06:23,076
I think it's the agent
who interrogated me.

560
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,577
Agent Strahm.

561
01:06:27,245 --> 01:06:30,621
- And why would he be following you?
- I don't know.

562
01:06:35,456 --> 01:06:38,749
- Who else have you told about this?
- Only you.

563
01:07:04,302 --> 01:07:06,261
What's going on with Amanda?

564
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:10,138
Didn't you tell me
the only way to truly offer enlightenment...

565
01:07:10,554 --> 01:07:12,388
...is by detaching emotionally?

566
01:07:15,973 --> 01:07:18,766
But you can have something
Amanda doesn't.

567
01:07:19,266 --> 01:07:21,309
Anonymity.

568
01:07:21,476 --> 01:07:25,102
That's the greatest protection.
That's what I've given you.

569
01:07:25,769 --> 01:07:28,479
I need you to set up a game...

570
01:07:29,271 --> 01:07:33,064
...that may not be entirely clear to you
right now.

571
01:07:34,273 --> 01:07:36,857
But I assure you that
the people being tested...

572
01:07:38,024 --> 01:07:40,775
...are part of something much larger.

573
01:07:41,276 --> 01:07:42,943
They're connected.

574
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:48,987
So in the end,
all the pieces will fit together...

575
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:53,155
...and it'll be clear.

576
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:56,907
Who are you?

577
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:00,575
- Amanda will fail you.
- We'll see.

578
01:08:01,492 --> 01:08:04,077
What are you doing?

579
01:08:10,288 --> 01:08:13,789
What's this?
- It's time to play a game.

580
01:08:15,832 --> 01:08:17,165
Help.

581
01:08:17,332 --> 01:08:19,291
Help me. What is this?

582
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:21,584
What is this? Please.

583
01:08:23,501 --> 01:08:28,920
Why are you keeping me here?
What is this place? What is this place?

584
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:04,227
We were all supposed to die.

585
01:09:08,187 --> 01:09:10,855
He's just fucking testing you.

586
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:12,605
Where is my daughter?

587
01:09:16,023 --> 01:09:17,899
Help!

588
01:09:18,316 --> 01:09:20,025
He didn't make it.

589
01:09:20,484 --> 01:09:22,318
Nobody made it.

590
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:24,777
You were supposed to be the hero.

591
01:10:03,335 --> 01:10:05,377
Peter, where the hell are you?

592
01:10:08,045 --> 01:10:09,671
Hello?

593
01:10:19,508 --> 01:10:22,509
You've reached the voice mail
for Special Agent Peter Strahm.

594
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,510
Leave a message.

595
01:10:27,386 --> 01:10:30,888
Cowan, I wanna put a locator
on Strahm's mobile phone.

596
01:10:31,805 --> 01:10:33,389
Right away, sir.

597
01:10:33,514 --> 01:10:35,140
Call me right back.

598
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:36,807
Right.

599
01:11:37,249 --> 01:11:40,500
- What the hell is that?
- It's our next nightmare.

600
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:49,004
There are blades in here.

601
01:11:53,422 --> 01:11:55,423
It's connected to the door.

602
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:57,841
When the beaker fills up,
the door opens.

603
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:02,593
Fills with what?

604
01:12:03,551 --> 01:12:07,261
Blood. Our blood.

605
01:12:08,095 --> 01:12:13,139
I think an arm is supposed to go in there
to fill the beaker.

606
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:16,515
Wait. Why can't we just use
the water from the other room?

607
01:12:16,724 --> 01:12:17,932
No, the slots are closed.

608
01:12:18,058 --> 01:12:21,184
We have to stick our arm in to
keep them open, but they'd get stuck.

609
01:12:21,434 --> 01:12:23,101
We need to close that door.

610
01:12:24,727 --> 01:12:26,228
So, what?

611
01:12:26,853 --> 01:12:32,022
We fight to the death, and one gets
to freedom with the other person's blood?

612
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:38,733
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

613
01:12:38,858 --> 01:12:41,025
Do you still have the keys
from that first room?

614
01:12:41,317 --> 01:12:43,610
- Yeah.
- Try one of them on that door.

615
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:46,861
- It won't work.
- No, it might. This one has a keyhole.

616
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:54,239
It... It's not even the same lock.

617
01:12:57,616 --> 01:12:59,742
Wait, why are there five slots
in this machine?

618
01:13:00,325 --> 01:13:02,451
Shouldn't there only be one?

619
01:13:09,329 --> 01:13:11,288
They all would have worked.

620
01:13:36,048 --> 01:13:37,674
There you are, Strahm.

621
01:13:38,633 --> 01:13:41,634
All right. I got him.

622
01:13:49,262 --> 01:13:51,471
I don't think this is a good idea.

623
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,639
The tub wasn't meant for one person.

624
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:55,765
We were supposed to hold
one cable each...

625
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:58,349
...and suffer a small shock.

626
01:13:58,683 --> 01:14:00,058
It was meant for five people.

627
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,518
They all were. Every game.

628
01:14:02,643 --> 01:14:05,185
We only needed one key
in the first room.

629
01:14:05,352 --> 01:14:08,979
They all worked, and any one of them
would have opened every collar.

630
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:13,439
In the second room, the three tubes were
large enough for more than one person.

631
01:14:13,564 --> 01:14:16,649
We were supposed to work together
so we all survived.

632
01:14:16,774 --> 01:14:18,441
That's the game.

633
01:14:18,649 --> 01:14:20,734
Your instincts will tell you to do
one thing...

634
01:14:20,942 --> 01:14:23,026
...but I implore you to do the opposite.

635
01:14:23,276 --> 01:14:24,777
Oh, God.

636
01:14:24,944 --> 01:14:27,862
Yeah. Big fucking whoops.

637
01:14:43,076 --> 01:14:44,744
Hello, and welcome.

638
01:14:44,869 --> 01:14:46,744
This journey
has been one of discovery...

639
01:14:46,995 --> 01:14:51,246
...and hopefully you've discovered that the
whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

640
01:14:51,913 --> 01:14:55,957
The human body, for instance,
is an astoundingly durable creation.

641
01:14:56,082 --> 01:14:58,875
It contains approximately 10 pints
of blood...

642
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:02,960
...yet it is still able to operate
with just half of that.

643
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:06,003
The device before you is
one of sacrifice.

644
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:07,670
A sacrifice of blood.

645
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:12,255
In order to open the door, the beaker
must be filled to the marked level...

646
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:15,757
...a level that is of no coincidence.

647
01:15:15,923 --> 01:15:18,174
This amount can come
from any one of you.

648
01:15:18,341 --> 01:15:21,967
That does not matter.
What does matter is time.

649
01:15:22,093 --> 01:15:24,802
For in 15 minutes,
if the beaker is not filled...

650
01:15:24,969 --> 01:15:29,262
...the bombs will explode
and the doors will be sealed forever.

651
01:15:29,387 --> 01:15:34,264
So now I ask you, how much blood
will you give in order to survive?

652
01:15:40,308 --> 01:15:42,018
Fuck! Fuck.

653
01:15:42,559 --> 01:15:47,853
All right, so one person can fill the beaker
with ten pints of blood and die.

654
01:15:48,145 --> 01:15:50,021
Or two people can fill it...

655
01:15:50,271 --> 01:15:52,272
...with five pints...

656
01:15:52,355 --> 01:15:54,481
...and maybe live.

657
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:57,149
What are we gonna do?

658
01:16:29,287 --> 01:16:30,579
I lied.

659
01:16:32,122 --> 01:16:35,165
I know the investigative journalist in there.
His name is Charles.

660
01:16:35,331 --> 01:16:37,999
He was writing a story about what I did.

661
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:41,000
What'd you do?

662
01:16:42,876 --> 01:16:44,960
A dealer gave me...

663
01:16:45,169 --> 01:16:48,587
...an ounce of heroin to burn down
an abandoned building.

664
01:16:48,712 --> 01:16:49,754
But it wa...

665
01:16:49,921 --> 01:16:53,005
Oh, God. It wasn't abandoned.
There was eight people in there.

666
01:16:53,172 --> 01:16:56,549
Eight people died.

667
01:16:56,882 --> 01:17:00,300
And the feds got involved.

668
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:03,218
And I got caught but I made a deal
and my dad got me off.

669
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:06,678
The guy who hired me disappeared
and nothing happened. Nothing happened.

670
01:17:33,606 --> 01:17:35,481
That's how she knew me.

671
01:17:35,648 --> 01:17:37,899
The woman in the tub.

672
01:17:38,608 --> 01:17:41,025
The fire. It's what connects us.

673
01:17:41,817 --> 01:17:44,902
The fire inspector who wrote
the bogus accident report...

674
01:17:45,069 --> 01:17:49,112
...the city planner who pushed through
the residential permits...

675
01:17:49,404 --> 01:17:53,030
...the journalist that buried
the investigative story...

676
01:17:53,197 --> 01:17:56,157
...the rich-kid junkie
who was the patsy...

677
01:17:56,282 --> 01:17:59,200
...and the real estate developer
who set it all in motion.

678
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:04,202
We killed eight people
and stole the property, and nobody cared.

679
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:05,994
Nobody cared?

680
01:18:06,536 --> 01:18:09,204
Eight people and their families cared.

681
01:18:09,371 --> 01:18:13,122
The feds cared. Look at my fucking arm.
I cared! I cared!

682
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:15,206
But you didn't face justice.

683
01:18:15,707 --> 01:18:16,790
None of us did.

684
01:18:16,915 --> 01:18:19,208
Why did they all do it?

685
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:20,459
Why? Was it for money?

686
01:18:21,376 --> 01:18:23,918
This was your plan?
You were the one behind it?

687
01:18:24,752 --> 01:18:28,920
There was eight people in that building.
You had to know that. Did you know that?

688
01:18:30,254 --> 01:18:31,755
You're a monster.

689
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,591
So are you.

690
01:18:38,508 --> 01:18:41,426
We both deserve to be here.

691
01:19:34,198 --> 01:19:36,907
I can't do this alone. Look at me.
I can't do this alone.

692
01:19:37,074 --> 01:19:38,116
Okay. It's okay.

693
01:20:03,627 --> 01:20:04,835
We have to go on three.

694
01:20:23,301 --> 01:20:24,260
One.

695
01:20:32,305 --> 01:20:34,223
Two.

696
01:20:38,016 --> 01:20:40,308
Put your hand in the hole!

697
01:20:48,645 --> 01:20:50,271
Three!

698
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:20,767
Hello, Agent Strahm.

699
01:22:21,226 --> 01:22:25,936
If you are hearing this, then you have
once again found what you're looking for.

700
01:22:26,061 --> 01:22:27,436
Or so you think.

701
01:22:27,645 --> 01:22:30,521
Your dedication is to be commended.

702
01:22:30,771 --> 01:22:35,356
But I ask you if you have learned anything
on your journey of discovery.

703
01:22:35,523 --> 01:22:37,399
As the old adage goes:

704
01:22:37,649 --> 01:22:43,068
"Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me. "

705
01:22:43,568 --> 01:22:47,653
The situation you find yourself in
is one of trust.

706
01:22:47,903 --> 01:22:52,363
So I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,
have you learned to trust me?

707
01:22:52,489 --> 01:22:57,866
The only way to survive this room
is by entering the glass box before you.

708
01:22:58,033 --> 01:23:03,035
Pain will be incurred,
but you have a chance of survival.

709
01:23:30,963 --> 01:23:32,130
We did it.

710
01:23:32,338 --> 01:23:35,548
We won.

711
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:26,261
I got you, you motherfucker.

712
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:49,604
Drop it!

713
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:51,772
I said drop it!

714
01:25:58,108 --> 01:26:01,317
Who did this to you?

715
01:26:03,902 --> 01:26:07,111
We won.

716
01:26:07,278 --> 01:26:09,571
We worked together.

717
01:26:19,992 --> 01:26:24,785
I need immediate medical assistance.
1293 Sandburst Drive.

718
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:07,095
Jesus, Peter.

719
01:27:23,476 --> 01:27:25,269
Tell me how to open it.

720
01:27:25,644 --> 01:27:26,603
How do I open it?

721
01:27:39,692 --> 01:27:43,360
However, if you choose not to,
you will never be heard from again.

722
01:27:43,485 --> 01:27:45,777
Your body will never be found.

723
01:27:45,902 --> 01:27:47,820
You will simply vanish.

724
01:27:48,612 --> 01:27:54,489
I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,
have you learned enough to trust me?

725
01:27:54,656 --> 01:27:56,407
Will you heed my warning?

726
01:27:56,574 --> 01:27:58,533
- For if you do not...
- Fuck you.

727
01:27:58,699 --> 01:28:00,992
...this room will forever be your tomb.

728
01:28:01,242 --> 01:28:04,285
And my legacy will become yours.

729
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:07,328
If you're good at anticipating
the human mind...

730
01:28:07,495 --> 01:28:10,079
- I think I'm being followed.
- Who would be following you?

731
01:28:10,288 --> 01:28:12,705
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

732
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:15,081
He suspected someone on the inside.

733
01:28:17,374 --> 01:28:19,792
- It leaves nothing to chance.

734
01:28:23,126 --> 01:28:24,794
We were all supposed to die.

735
01:28:26,128 --> 01:28:27,837
You were supposed to be the hero.

736
01:28:31,505 --> 01:28:32,880
Make your choice.

737
01:28:37,716 --> 01:28:39,300
Cowan.

738
01:28:39,425 --> 01:28:40,675
Yeah, this is Erickson.

739
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,218
I want you to put out an APB.

740
01:28:43,635 --> 01:28:46,428
Suspect's name is Peter Strahm.

741
01:28:46,886 --> 01:28:48,512
Yeah, that's right.

742
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,805
Special Agent Peter Strahm.

743
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:15,607
I'm gonna stop you, you son of a bitch.

744
01:29:18,983 --> 01:29:21,817
I know who you are. I know.
