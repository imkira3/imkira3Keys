1
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:04,588
<i>Plenty of sunshine today...</i>

2
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:05,743
<i>With seasonal temperatures,</i>

3
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,042
<i>we should reach our normal
high over this afternoon.</i>

4
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,040
<i>Clear skies tonight...</i>

5
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,348
<i>Increasing cloudiness tomorrow,
sticky and humid...</i>

6
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,967
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come give me a kiss.

7
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,868
You must be good.

8
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:33,087
- Bye.
- Bye.

9
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:34,835
Have fun!

10
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:46,095
<i>Cleve, it's 1955.</i>

11
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:47,575
<i>Please re-enter the clubhouse</i>

12
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:50,176
<i>in a more stereo typically
animated fashion.</i>

13
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:19,788
Hey man, you know where
I could find Frank Barnes?

14
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:21,123
- Sir?
- Frank Barnes?

15
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:26,577
Good luck.

16
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,329
Thanks.

17
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,931
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Frank Barnes?

18
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:40,157
You found him.

19
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:41,025
I'm Will Colson.

20
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:43,819
We're working together
today on train 1206.

21
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,527
- 1206.
- That's the one.

22
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,616
- That's the profile?
- Yeah, want to take a look?

23
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,954
How you doing?

24
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:00,290
Is there a problem?

25
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:01,834
No problem.

26
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,587
I just don't like working
in a damn daycare center.

27
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:08,428
Yeah well.. I don't like working
at a retirement home or so.

28
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,506
Alright!
I'll tell you what.

29
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,761
I'm gonna finish my coffee.
I'll meet you on the wagon.

30
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:14,384
Sounds good.

31
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,804
- 1206.
- Yeah, that's the one.

32
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,566
You know that punk's union, right?

33
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:24,069
Heard they just made him
a shop steward at the UTU.

34
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,354
First year?

35
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:27,985
You know how he got hired?
His name's Colson.

36
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,267
His two uncles are running
things over at Thornwood,

37
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:32,743
and his brother's a
lead welder at Deacon.

38
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,921
The whole family's
from Stanton.

39
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,414
Now, that figures.

40
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:38,408
Here, they're shit-canning
guys every day...

41
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:41,510
but you got the right last name
and a rookie's pay grade.

42
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:43,855
You got a job.

43
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:54,640
What the hell are
these guys?

44
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:58,141
Dewey... Gilleece.

45
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,146
Sorry to break up
charm school.

46
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:03,942
What the hell is that beast
still doing on D-16?

47
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:05,982
I told you I need
that track clear.

48
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:09,030
Relax buddy, we were
just about to move it.

49
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:10,448
Like hell you are.

50
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:14,073
I've got 150 school students coming
in on some field trip on D-16.

51
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:15,620
I need that track cleared.

52
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:17,613
D-10's clear, you can
set it there.

53
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:24,871
Alright, alright!
Settle down, settle down.

54
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:28,292
Welcome to the Railroad
Safety Campaign.

55
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:29,876
We are not-for-profit program

56
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:32,134
designed to educate young
people like yourselves

57
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:33,635
about railway safety.

58
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,511
Hey! Settle down.

59
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:37,012
Show of hands.

60
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:38,719
Who's ridden a train before?

61
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,098
Me! Me! Me!

62
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,997
Alright! All aboard!

63
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,819
So what's our day?

64
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,544
They got us going on
light power.

65
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:54,267
We're supposed to pick up
25 cars just past Stanton,

66
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,294
then it's pretty much a straight
shot through Wilkins.

67
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:57,949
Any slow orders?

68
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:00,272
- No.
- You sure?

69
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,368
They'd be highlighted in red.

70
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,046
No, no slow orders.

71
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:08,606
Alright...

72
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:16,673
Dewey, what the hell
is taking you so long?

73
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:19,134
It's a 39-car consist, Bunny.

74
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,561
The thing's half a mile long...
for Christ's sake.

75
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,584
Gilleece, channel up.

76
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:30,319
Go for Gilleece.

77
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:31,863
You believe this shit?

78
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:36,993
Hey, hold up. You forgot to
tie the air in from the point.

79
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,740
Yeah, so?

80
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:41,330
So, you don't have
any air brakes.

81
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:42,908
You can tie the hoses
once we got her parked

82
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,618
and Bunny's quit
his bitching.

83
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:45,793
Okay.

84
00:06:57,575 --> 00:06:59,061
I only got one rule.

85
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,842
One rule only.

86
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,427
You gonna do something.
you do it right.

87
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,262
You don't know how to do it.
You ask me, alright?

88
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,739
Likewise, if you need anything
from me, you better speak up,

89
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,393
because.. you're the conductor.

90
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:11,102
Once we get our freight.
it's your train.

91
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,028
I'm just the guy
driving it.

92
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:15,114
How long you been
out of training?

93
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:16,728
About four months.

94
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,084
- Four months?
- Yeah.

95
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:19,185
Wow.

96
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,363
Fullon yellow vest rookie.

97
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:22,994
How long have you
been railroading?

98
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:26,997
28 years.. November 13, 1981.
28 years.

99
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:28,749
What did you do
before that?

100
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,149
Oh...

101
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,650
I don't know, a bunch of
different jobs.

102
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,525
Yeah?
No railroading?

103
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:37,349
No, just looking to do
something different.

104
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,465
Something different?

105
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,670
What do you mean,
something better?

106
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,760
No, no.
Just...

107
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:46,537
- Different.
- Just different.

108
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,396
Hey Dewey, want to pick
it up a little bit jagoff?

109
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:56,982
I want to have lunch at
some point.

110
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:23,849
- Yeah.
- Hey.

111
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,853
Your lawyer just called.
You got a break.

112
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:29,101
The hearing's been moved
up to this morning.

113
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,353
Looks like, you'll be going home.

114
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,252
Well, that's great but...

115
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,275
Did you tell him
I was working?

116
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,405
I can't come in.

117
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:43,753
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He said no problem man.

118
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,996
- And he said it's looking good.
- Alright.

119
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,660
Call him in an hour or two,
see where it's at.

120
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:52,495
- I will.
- Give me a call.

121
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:55,252
We ready to pull out
or what?

122
00:08:56,177 --> 00:08:57,542
Coming.

123
00:08:58,546 --> 00:08:59,711
Alright.

124
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:01,637
Train's leaving.

125
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,180
What's our fuel gauge reading?

126
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,128
Fuel gauge?

127
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,279
- 2900.
- 2900?

128
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:17,437
Anglecock's closed.
Hand brake's knocked off.

129
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:18,647
Good, good, good.

130
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,481
Got all the updated division
notices and bulletin orders.

131
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:21,657
The POS releases are in.

132
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,575
Filled out our time slips.
We're good to go.

133
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,574
Good! Alright.

134
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:44,763
You're at 29 cars, you got
10 to go, you're good.

135
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,318
Dewey, you got 29, ten more
makes thirty nine...

136
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:52,580
You taking PB-9
over to D-10?

137
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:57,602
Dewey.

138
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,145
Dewey.

139
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,472
Hold your horses.

140
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,341
What's wrong?

141
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:08,246
Damn trailing point switch.
The track's aligned for D-16.

142
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,490
What's your stopping distance?

143
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,868
At least 20 cars to a stop.
Damn it!

144
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:15,253
Okay, so we back it up
and lose a little time.

145
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,190
I'm hopping out.

146
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:20,712
Do not get out of
that cab, man!

147
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:23,211
Don't worry, I'll set
the independent.

148
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:26,313
- Dewey!
- Dewey.

149
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,766
Come on, get back on.

150
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,816
Dewey!
You better get back on!

151
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:39,902
I'm on it. I'm on it.

152
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,297
Shit!

153
00:11:08,776 --> 00:11:10,386
You better get back on, dickhead!

154
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,339
Hey!

155
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:26,737
Shit!

156
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:28,450
<i>Nice job Dewey!</i>

157
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:47,211
God damn it!

158
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,368
So now what the hell
do we do?

159
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:12,011
Shh... shoot.

160
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:26,088
Ooh... you're in trouble.

161
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,395
Just don't talk about it.

162
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,796
Just put your sister on
the phone, Sweetheart.

163
00:12:31,726 --> 00:12:32,932
Dad!

164
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,430
She doesn't want
to talk to you.

165
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,439
Listen. Just tell her I was...
I didn't forget. I was just...

166
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:41,562
I was running late.

167
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,731
She's got a date tonight.

168
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,153
With who?

169
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,823
Just put your
sister on the phone.

170
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,783
Wait... here she is.

171
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,242
Nic?

172
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,377
Nicky?

173
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:03,120
Hello?

174
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,677
Listen, just...

175
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,053
Baby, look, I didn't forget.
I was...

176
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:29,189
Frank, the stop blocks are up.
Is there a problem?

177
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,816
No, there's no problem except
you got it backwards.

178
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:36,070
Turntable house goes on my end.
You're on the ballast.

179
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:37,575
On my end.

180
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:40,830
Other than that, no problem.
No problem at all.

181
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,246
Like I told you...

182
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,015
if you don't know something,
just ask.

183
00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:56,416
That's all.

184
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,129
I got it.

185
00:13:58,621 --> 00:13:59,886
I hope so.

186
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,264
Whatever.

187
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,112
Excuse me?

188
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:09,904
This shit, this "Let's make the new
guy prove himself" bullshit.

189
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:14,108
I gotta tell you I've heard it before
and it gets old real fast.

190
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,535
Well, that's how it is at
the retirement home.

191
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,285
Company wants to get
rid of us old heads.

192
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:27,422
They give all the jobs to you
new guys, you yellow vests.

193
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:29,840
I'm not trying to take
anything from anybody.

194
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:31,918
As reassuring as that is...

195
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,380
a lot of guys
don't see it that way.

196
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:01,080
I'm here, I'm walking in
right now.

197
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:03,746
I got a car full of donuts
for those kids.

198
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,490
- A coaster? What train?
- Connie?

199
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:08,913
How the hell did this happen?

200
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,130
It just got away from me.

201
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,170
It got away from you?

202
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:14,134
It's a train, Dewey.
Not a chipmunk.

203
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:16,713
I had to leave the cab
to throw a switch.

204
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:18,513
- You left the cab?
- Yeah.

205
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:19,932
And it gets worse.

206
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:24,099
The air brakes weren't tied on.
They aren't tied on, still..

207
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,017
We've got an unmanned train
rolling into opposing traffic.

208
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:30,317
With no air brakes?
Is that what you're telling me?

209
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:32,360
I set the independent brakes.
That'll for sure stop it.

210
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:33,688
How fast is it going?

211
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:35,109
No more than 10 miles per...

212
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:36,779
Okay, jump on the high
rail and go after it.

213
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,000
Now!

214
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,277
Okay, ballbuster.

215
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:50,712
Call the field trip!

216
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,210
I don't care where they
are on the main line.

217
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,081
They need to get into
the nearest siding.

218
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:57,295
RS Campaign, RS Campaign.
This is Fuller Yard. Do you copy?

219
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:03,959
RSC answering dispatch.
How can I help you? Over.

220
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:05,556
RS Campaign.
This is Fuller Yard.

221
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:07,559
We've got unauthorized
activity on your track.

222
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,016
We're gonna need you to divert
to a siding at Portville.

223
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:13,777
Dispatch, please repeat.

224
00:16:14,782 --> 00:16:16,488
Please repeat.
Over!

225
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:19,074
What time is train time?

226
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,651
Anytime!

227
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,787
Divert to a siding in Portville.
Do you copy?

228
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:26,840
I copy, I'll divert into the
siding at Portville, over.

229
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,999
Get me 777's cargo information.

230
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,075
I have to call corporate
and report this.

231
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:40,417
Now, Dewey said he applied
the independent.

232
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:43,720
So, friction should stop the damn
thing after a few miles.

233
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:46,177
Still. we need to alert every
northbound train on the mainline.

234
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,263
First 20 miles of track
take priority.

235
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:53,768
I don't care if you're
talking about

236
00:16:53,863 --> 00:16:55,528
a spot weld on a
Class 3 rip track,

237
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:57,761
or ground operations
in Afghanistan.

238
00:16:57,962 --> 00:16:59,262
It's all about precision.

239
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,287
- Right.
- Thank you.

240
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:03,361
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

241
00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:05,149
Hello.

242
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:06,489
Ned. where are you?

243
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:09,667
Oh, Connie. Hey, I'm
just driving in now.

244
00:17:09,754 --> 00:17:10,994
I got to go.

245
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:12,703
How far are you
from milepost 5?

246
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,255
Roughly six minutes, traffic contingent.

247
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:17,170
Great, I need you to
haul ass over there

248
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:19,047
and throw the siding switch.
We got a coaster.

249
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,390
A coaster?
Really?

250
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:23,297
Yeah, it should roll past
MP 5 in about 15 minutes.

251
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:24,970
That should give you enough
time to throw the switch

252
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,677
get it off the mainline
and onto that siding.

253
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:29,512
You want me to climb
onboard and stop it?

254
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:31,820
What? No, no, no. We got two
hostlers are on their way.

255
00:17:31,921 --> 00:17:33,221
You just throw the switch, Ned.

256
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,646
Roger that.

257
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:37,494
You can always count
on him to be late.

258
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:39,430
I'll see you later.

259
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,472
See you...

260
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:43,084
<i>Yeah, I can get you where
you need to go...</i>

261
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,639
<i>'Cause I'm a country boy.</i>

262
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:56,584
What do we do when we
get to a railroad crossing?

263
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,213
Stop, look and listen!

264
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:00,588
I can't hear you!

265
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,046
Stop, look and listen!

266
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,094
You from Stanton?

267
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:29,751
- Born and raised.
- Yeah?

268
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,912
My whole family's
from Stanton.

269
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:36,412
Married?

270
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,379
Yeah.

271
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,838
Well, sort of.
It's a long story.

272
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,364
We got a long day.

273
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,702
How about you?
You married?

274
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,958
Short story.
Once...

275
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:57,358
Got 2 beautiful daughters though,
eighteen, nineteen.

276
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:01,066
They are both waitressing, trying
to work their way thru college.

277
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:02,613
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

278
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,265
- Where at?
- Hooters.

279
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:10,367
Hooters. You know?
Alright.

280
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:13,656
That's right, Hooters.
Wipe that grin off your face.

281
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:15,326
- I'm a fan.
- Yeah.

282
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,110
You're blushing.

283
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,462
I'm used to it.

284
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,323
I'm used to it.

285
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:34,515
Connie!
Corporate on line 2.

286
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,228
This is Connie Hooper
at Fuller Yard.

287
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:40,938
I'll hold.

288
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:45,597
Did I hear right?
You've got a coaster?

289
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:48,697
Yeah, this sort of thing happens.
We're on it.

290
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,653
Won't it trip a relay?

291
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:54,369
Yeah Listen, I need to speak
to Mr Galvin directly.

292
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:58,828
I see, can you have
him call me then?

293
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,922
No, I'm about to review the
cargo shipment on myself.

294
00:20:04,595 --> 00:20:05,630
Who the hell are you?

295
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,427
I'm here for the Railroad
Safety Campaign.

296
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:11,033
Scott Werner FRA Region Two,
Federal Safety Inspector.

297
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,763
I'm supposed to give a presentation
to the children.

298
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:13,611
- go over some basic stuff.
- That's great.

299
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,512
Hey Bunny?
Bunny!

300
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:16,721
Can you help me out here?

301
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,306
Okay, see this guy
right there?

302
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,335
He's gonna tell you
where to sit.

303
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,516
- Okay.
- Track geometry, alignment...

304
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:21,646
- Thank you so much.
- I brought some gauges...

305
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:23,819
The kids are gonna love that.
It's great.

306
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:45,758
God damn it. Where the
hell is this thing?

307
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:57,136
Bunny, I need to know exactly
what's in cars 7 to 10?

308
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:58,641
Get a hold of the shipper, please?

309
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:08,072
Are you kidding me?

310
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,496
Where's the train?

311
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:18,165
Where does it look like
the goddamn train is?

312
00:21:18,294 --> 00:21:19,750
It's not here! What are
you doing out here?

313
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:21,953
Do I look like I got a train
hidden in my back pocket?

314
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:22,907
Bunny, get me Connie.

315
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,546
- Get behind us jackass.
- It's Ned.

316
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,048
- Did you get here too late?
- Don't give me that shit.

317
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:28,550
You know you two numbnuts
are always screwing up.

318
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:30,149
You switched the track
that was supposed

319
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,550
to get the train on the
right track.

320
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,880
Connie.
Yeah, it's Ned.

321
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:34,257
Did you throw that switch yet?

322
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:36,842
Yeah, six minutes ago but
your train it's not here.

323
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:39,053
I thought it might be going a
little slower than you guessed,

324
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:40,729
but these two numbnuts
that you sent.

325
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,056
They just showed up and
they ain't seen it, either.

326
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:43,812
Are you saying our train
already passed?

327
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,484
Yes ma'am, that be my guess.

328
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,103
It's not a coaster.
That train under power.

329
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:49,658
That be my guess too.

330
00:21:50,618 --> 00:21:51,808
Put Dewey on the phone.

331
00:21:51,902 --> 00:21:54,412
Sure, she wants to talk
to you, asshole!

332
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,111
Yeah.

333
00:21:55,205 --> 00:21:57,491
I need you to rally every
cell in that brain of yours.

334
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,789
When you applied the independent,

335
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:01,083
was the throttle in the
forward position?

336
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,910
Yeah, I had to get
it moving, Connie.

337
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:05,417
In what position was the
throttle set?

338
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,499
Damn it Dewey.
What position?

339
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:13,595
Connie, the throttle was
in notch 8 full power.

340
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:15,843
Okay.
It was 39 cars!

341
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:22,262
Okay.

342
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:24,644
Take the southbound track.
Catch up.

343
00:22:25,035 --> 00:22:27,351
See if it's still going slow enough
for one of you to climb on.

344
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:31,610
You have got until milepost 13
before the track splits.

345
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,985
Let me talk to Ned again.

346
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:38,983
Nice job asshole!

347
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:44,452
Ned, I want you to get back in your
car and follow the mainline, okay?

348
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:45,831
I want a set of eyes
on that train.

349
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:47,709
You got them.
Roger that!

350
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:00,593
I can't hear you!

351
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:03,516
Railroad Safety Campaign!

352
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:03,413
You're good.

353
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:06,909
Keep it coming, fifty.

354
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:11,005
Twenty feet.

355
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,476
Slow down.

356
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,461
Alright, you're good.

357
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,276
Yeah.
What's going on?

358
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:35,187
You got a minute?

359
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,235
I thought he said it
was looking good.

360
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,529
That's what he thought.

361
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:46,115
Turns out the judge they assigned,
was a real hard ass.

362
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:48,446
You gotta be kidding me.

363
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,753
<i>Look, the restraining order is being
continued for another</i>

364
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:52,155
- 30 days.
- Thirty days?

365
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:53,756
What am I supposed to
do for 30 days?

366
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,173
<i>I'll have to stay away from my kid?</i>

367
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,596
And then there's another
hearing after that, I guess.

368
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,842
What's taking you so long,
Will?

369
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:03,427
You call that lawyer,
you can tell him...

370
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,884
he can stick it up his ass.
I got to go.

371
00:25:04,978 --> 00:25:06,343
Will!
Pick up the radio.

372
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:10,059
Will! Pick up the radio, over.

373
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,440
Are you there?

374
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,817
Yeah.

375
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:16,524
Yeah, get off the phone, knock
off the hand brakes.

376
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,822
Get up here, it's time to go.
We got work to do.

377
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:19,989
Copy.

378
00:25:32,222 --> 00:25:33,502
No, it's definitely under power.

379
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,046
We're not sure of the
exact speed yet.

380
00:25:35,384 --> 00:25:38,000
I thought all these trains had
some sort of deadman brake.

381
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:40,256
There's a wand the engineer
has to hit periodically

382
00:25:40,347 --> 00:25:41,962
or the air brakes are
automatically applied.

383
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:44,594
Unfortunately, this train's air
brakes were disconnected.

384
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:48,351
<i>Sir, I would gladly explain the particulars
of locomotive operation to you.</i>

385
00:25:48,438 --> 00:25:51,396
If we had time but right now
I really need your assistance

386
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,394
posting officers at all the
mainline crossings.

387
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,974
One question.

388
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:57,065
How do you all
plan to stop it?

389
00:25:58,532 --> 00:25:59,817
We're working on it.

390
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:03,734
Go, go, go!
The split's coming up!

391
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:14,078
Are you sure you
can do this?

392
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,788
Just get along side
of the cab.

393
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,504
Get up along side of it!

394
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,679
I'm trying!

395
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,535
Go, go, go!

396
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,975
Remember, we don't have
a lot of track!

397
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:44,862
You got it.
Go! Go!

398
00:26:47,664 --> 00:26:49,074
Dewey!

399
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:51,114
It's too fast!
Back it up!

400
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:53,659
Come on Dewey!
Go back! Go back!

401
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,094
Jump Gilleece!
Do it!

402
00:27:05,182 --> 00:27:06,968
Get in! Watch out!

403
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:13,974
So now what the hell
do we do?

404
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:30,862
How many cars are we
supposed to cut in?

405
00:27:33,126 --> 00:27:34,582
Twenty, why?

406
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,035
Twenty cars.
Okay.

407
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:38,207
See the switch stand
up ahead of us?

408
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:40,588
- The switch stand, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

409
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:43,880
Take a look in the rear view mirror.
You see the one behind us?

410
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:46,007
- Way back there. You see it?
- Uh-huh.

411
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:49,261
There's exactly 21 cars
between the two stands.

412
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:50,766
Don't ask me how I know.

413
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:52,513
So why is it that

414
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:55,896
there's still more than four and
a half cars that are yet to clear?

415
00:27:58,393 --> 00:27:59,653
Because I...

416
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,075
Excuse me?

417
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:02,948
- Because I cut...
- Because what?

418
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,104
I cut in too many cars.

419
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,814
Cut in too many cars, huh?

420
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:08,108
Maybe if you weren't on
my ass the whole time.

421
00:28:08,203 --> 00:28:10,319
I might be able to think
straight and do my job.

422
00:28:10,414 --> 00:28:11,369
What do you mean.
"Maybe if I..."

423
00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:13,363
- You been on my ass this whole trip!
- You're blaming it on me?

424
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,948
I'm just saying pick
a goddamn job!

425
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:17,053
- I got my job! You pick one, I pull the throttle!
- Then I pull the throttle, you pull the pin!

426
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,727
- It's one or the other!
- Used to pull the pin!

427
00:28:18,814 --> 00:28:20,079
You're five pins too many.

428
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:22,084
Pull the pins, you're right.
Pull the pins.

429
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:23,881
I've had my training!
Alright?

430
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,631
Yeah, but we're out here in the
real world. This ain't training.

431
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:29,464
In training they just give you an "F".
Out here, you get killed.

432
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:31,139
- I screwed up. okay?
- Yes, you did.

433
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:32,716
Stop and roll back and
I'll cut the empties.

434
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,300
Roll back?

435
00:28:35,522 --> 00:28:36,887
Oh Lord...

436
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:38,726
We can't stop out
here on the main.

437
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:40,099
We're more than a mile
out on the main.

438
00:28:40,193 --> 00:28:41,478
More than a mile
to the next stop.

439
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,733
You don't take a consist this
size that distance in reverse.

440
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:49,862
Fine, then we'll make the
turn at the next siding.

441
00:28:49,953 --> 00:28:52,194
The next siding's
not for 10 miles.

442
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:54,280
We do that, we're late.
I don't run late.

443
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:55,830
Just green-sheet it
and we'll move on.

444
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,983
Come on, we green-sheet it.
It's my ass!

445
00:28:58,078 --> 00:28:59,714
- Cut me some slack.
- What do you mean it's your ass?

446
00:28:59,715 --> 00:29:00,715
You're a Colson.

447
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:01,685
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

448
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,504
That means you can call your uncle
and they'll take care of it.

449
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:04,072
Is that what this
is about?

450
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,840
No, it's about the 5 cars
too many.

451
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:08,213
We're gonna stop roll back
and cut those empties!

452
00:29:08,305 --> 00:29:10,967
This may be your engine.
but it's my goddamn train.

453
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:12,885
- Yes it is your train!
- I'm the goddamn conductor!

454
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:13,654
That's true!

455
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:14,555
<i>1206, check in.</i>

456
00:29:14,744 --> 00:29:16,350
I'll write you up and
green-sheet your ass.

457
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:17,427
- Will you?
- How about that?

458
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,164
<i>1206, this is dispatch.
What's your location? Over.</i>

459
00:29:21,242 --> 00:29:22,682
- Something's funny?
- No.

460
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:24,609
What the hell are you laughing at?
What are you laughing at?

461
00:29:24,738 --> 00:29:27,104
Because it's funny.
You're a funny guy.

462
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:29,287
Well-trained but funny.

463
00:29:29,388 --> 00:29:30,888
Yeah, this is 1206.

464
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,243
We're 60 miles from Wilkins.

465
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:36,020
Forty minutes out
of Fuller Yard.

466
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:38,582
Negative 1206, clear your
train at the next siding

467
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:40,333
<i>until further instructed, over.</i>

468
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,230
What's up?

469
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,226
There's an unmanned train
out of Fuller,

470
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:46,127
on the northbound track, over.

471
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,500
On our track?

472
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,231
A coaster?

473
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:51,737
1206, we don't have
all the details yet.

474
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,139
Just proceed to the next siding
and hold tight, over.

475
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,966
Next siding's not for 10 miles.

476
00:29:56,953 --> 00:29:58,309
Affirmative, 1206.

477
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,762
Just get in that siding
and sit tight

478
00:29:59,856 --> 00:30:01,221
until we give you the
the all-clear, over.

479
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:02,726
Affirmative!

480
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:07,773
It's coming right at us.

481
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,499
More word on that runaway freight
train in rural Pennsylvania.

482
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:23,001
The train, A WVR777

483
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,170
otherwise known as 777,

484
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,248
left Fuller Yard in northern PA

485
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:29,575
sometime before 8 a.m.
this morning

486
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,209
and no one was on board.

487
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:33,883
Live, local, late-breaking.

488
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,848
The engineer, they say, made an
error in controlling the train.

489
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,270
Before leaving the locomotive,

490
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:40,578
he intended to apply the
independent brakes.

491
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,583
And then by the time he
realized his mistake,

492
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,423
the train was going too fast
for him to climb back on.

493
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:47,351
We're being told now
by a spokesperson

494
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:48,819
for the
Public Utilities Commission

495
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:51,776
that this employee
will be held accountable.

496
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:02,165
- Connie?
- Yeah.

497
00:31:02,252 --> 00:31:05,039
Headquarters is on the phone.
It's Galvin.

498
00:31:12,095 --> 00:31:13,551
Mr Galvin, how are you?

499
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,048
God damn it.
How could this happen?

500
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:19,433
It's an unfortunate combination
of human error and bad luck.

501
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,634
Luck?

502
00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:23,061
I was a yardmaster for
10 years Miss Hooper.

503
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,013
Luck has no business
in a rail yard.

504
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:27,103
What are we worried about
in terms of cargo?

505
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:29,226
Well, obviously the diesel
fuel's a concern.

506
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:31,065
No, I said cargo.

507
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:32,520
Okay, well,
cars 7 through 10

508
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,071
and 16 through 19 are carrying
a chemical called molten phenol.

509
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,072
We're still trying to
connect with the shipper

510
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,653
to determine exactly
what that is.

511
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:41,454
It's used in
the manufacture of glue.

512
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,247
Can you hold on
one moment?

513
00:31:44,127 --> 00:31:45,367
You know about molten phenol?

514
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:46,644
Yes.

515
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:52,116
Mr Galvin, we have an
FRA inspector here.

516
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,126
May I put you on speaker?

517
00:31:57,265 --> 00:32:00,757
Region 2 Federal Safety Inspector
Scott Werner. How can I help?

518
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,184
Just tell me what you know
about molten phenol.

519
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:08,106
Well, it's serious stuff.
Very toxic, highly combustible.

520
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,649
Oh, that's terrific.

521
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:11,397
Hooper, get state police
back on the line.

522
00:32:11,488 --> 00:32:13,274
Make sure they got a HazMat
team briefed and ready.

523
00:32:14,074 --> 00:32:16,315
And ask them to put a
spotter chopper over 777.

524
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:18,404
I take it you've sided
all rail traffic?

525
00:32:18,495 --> 00:32:20,426
On our end, yes.
Brewster's notifying its own.

526
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,945
Sir.

527
00:32:22,082 --> 00:32:23,297
how are we going to
handle this?

528
00:32:23,392 --> 00:32:25,373
I mean this train is
enroute to pass

529
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,291
through some highly
populated areas.

530
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,746
We're having a strategy call
in about two minutes.

531
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:32,664
Alright, I'll be ready.

532
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,499
You won't be on the call,
Miss Hooper.

533
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:37,268
- Excuse me?
- You'll be advised.

534
00:32:37,397 --> 00:32:39,804
For now coordinate with
local authorities.

535
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:42,675
God knows we gotta have over 100
crossings that need to be secured.

536
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:44,809
One hundred and seventy-three.

537
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,811
Railroad crossings,

538
00:32:46,982 --> 00:32:49,644
between here and AWVR
substation in Brewster.

539
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,742
Listen... Mr Galvin,

540
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:55,132
this train is half
a mile long,

541
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:58,133
and is traveling at speed,
into population

542
00:32:58,218 --> 00:33:00,684
with eight freight cars of
hazardous chemicals,

543
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,240
and 5000 gallons of
diesel fuel.

544
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:05,963
Sir, we're not just talking
about a train here.

545
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:09,589
We're talking about a missile,
the size of the Chrysler Building.

546
00:33:09,746 --> 00:33:11,502
So what is your point,
Miss Hooper?

547
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,706
My point is after it crosses
through Findlay,

548
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:16,083
there's about 12 miles
of vacant farmland.

549
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:19,510
But after that, it's nothing
but town after town

550
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:20,587
all the way to Stanton.

551
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:21,918
We have a very
limited window here.

552
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,432
So, what are you suggesting
we do, derail it?

553
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,530
Yes sir, I am.

554
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,437
While we still can.

555
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:38,973
Mr Galvin, I understand that's gonna
cost the company a lot of money...

556
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:40,277
Do you think?

557
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,344
Miss Hooper, we're not
gonna intentionally,

558
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:44,045
destroy one of our
own trains.

559
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:46,070
Not when we can
still stop it.

560
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,331
We can avoid a lot
of collateral...

561
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:49,166
I'm going to extend you my
last ounce of good will

562
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:51,577
and pretend this conversation
never happened.

563
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,553
He thinks I'm worried
about my job.

564
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,631
Ma'am, please stay in
your van.

565
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,891
- Come on!
- Please get back into the van.

566
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,402
Can you please tell us
what's going on?

567
00:34:12,492 --> 00:34:14,007
Every crossing's closed off
for 20 miles.

568
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:15,892
Ma'am, for your safety,
please get back into your van.

569
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,144
I'm not getting back in
the vehicle.

570
00:34:17,238 --> 00:34:18,318
We need to know
what's going on.

571
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:42,044
Guys, get out of there.
There's a train coming.

572
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,299
Hurry!

573
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:46,343
Hurry! It's coming!

574
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:50,100
- Come on.
- We got to go.

575
00:34:50,313 --> 00:34:52,099
Get out of there!
Move it!

576
00:34:58,655 --> 00:35:00,316
Get out of the way!

577
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,319
1206 to dispatch, over.

578
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,075
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

579
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:49,824
We're not gonna fit in that siding,
that's what's wrong.

580
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,745
1206 to dispatch, over.

581
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,031
1206, are you in the siding yet?

582
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:55,553
What's your location?

583
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:58,419
No, we're not in the hole.
We're not gonna make it, can't do it.

584
00:35:58,673 --> 00:35:59,788
Too much train.

585
00:35:59,883 --> 00:36:01,544
I'm gonna need you to
realign the switch,

586
00:36:01,634 --> 00:36:03,215
so we can proceed to
the next siding.

587
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:05,419
1206, you have to get off
the main, over.

588
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:07,595
I understand that but you
gotta understand this.

589
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:08,717
We're not going to fit.

590
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,215
1206, stand by.

591
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:13,347
That siding's a good 3000 ft,
end to end.

592
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,765
Check your timetable.

593
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:17,768
It's gonna tell you the
siding is 4111 ft.

594
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:19,520
But that's signal to signal.

595
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:22,648
In reality,
it's more like 2500 ft.

596
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:24,695
You add those five cars
that you picked up...

597
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:25,863
We can fit.

598
00:36:25,992 --> 00:36:27,072
No, we won't fit.

599
00:36:28,077 --> 00:36:29,692
Dispatch, this is 1206.

600
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,449
Can you tell me where the
nearest rip track is?

601
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:34,747
1206, there's one in 6.2 miles.
How fast are you going?

602
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:36,786
55 miles an hour.

603
00:36:37,003 --> 00:36:38,288
1206, go faster, over.

604
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:40,495
Why? Is that coaster still
on the main?

605
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:44,796
1206, 777 is not a coaster.
I repeat, it is not a coaster, over.

606
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,551
You're telling me it's under power?

607
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:49,553
Get in the goddamn siding.

608
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:53,053
1206, stand by.

609
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:01,191
1206, if you're going for it, that
rip track is confirmed vacant.

610
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:02,979
It's your call, Frank.

611
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:04,732
We need to throw the switch
if you're staying on.

612
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:07,397
We're not staying on!
Pull the brake, Frank.

613
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:08,698
We pull the brake and side up.
I crash.

614
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:09,945
I know what the hell I'm doing.

615
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:11,618
Bullshit! You're gonna
get us killed.

616
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:12,419
Hey!

617
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:14,738
1206, I need an answer, over.

618
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:18,165
Realign the switch.

619
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:19,913
Over.

620
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:41,810
The train was just going with
no one in it. Just took off.

621
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:43,191
We were yelling on the
radio earlier,

622
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:44,518
there's a runaway train
coming through.

623
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:46,318
It could be coming to our
town next.

624
00:37:46,406 --> 00:37:48,362
And the high school's right
next to those train tracks.

625
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:49,689
<i>Just a few moments ago,</i>

626
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:51,740
<i>a train came barreling down
these tracks...</i>

627
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,617
We're still going over
the numbers.

628
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:58,119
But should 777 derail, we're
looking at a major disaster.

629
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:00,450
If even one of those
HazMat cars blew,

630
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:02,664
it could easily decimate
an entire town.

631
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:04,625
That train is carrying
eight of them.

632
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:07,082
Can you please explain to our
viewers what you witnessed...

633
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,219
Environmental liability, track damage,
car and locomotive loss.

634
00:38:11,848 --> 00:38:15,591
We're looking at a projected
cost easily over $100 million.

635
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:17,759
And the resulting stock devaluation?

636
00:38:17,854 --> 00:38:22,814
Our projections indicate it could
be in the 30 to 40 percent range.

637
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:23,715
Oh!

638
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,046
I say we go with
Mr Galvin's option.

639
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:29,691
I've already prepped our
substation in Brewster.

640
00:38:29,782 --> 00:38:31,318
They just need a go ahead.

641
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:32,982
You have it.

642
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:37,324
Okay, everybody out.

643
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,201
Hoffman, you stay here.

644
00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:42,329
Baker, get me a track schematic,
Fuller to Stanton, please!

645
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:57,803
This is Owens.

646
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:01,853
71, 70, 71 on the gun.

647
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:05,935
So the red means?

648
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:07,767
777 blew through a signal.

649
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:09,443
Everything in red means
trouble on the mainline.

650
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,895
That's a lot of red.

651
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:12,897
Connie, Mr Galvin on line 2.

652
00:39:16,162 --> 00:39:17,698
This is Connie Hooper.

653
00:39:18,164 --> 00:39:20,951
Have all the mainline crossings
been closed?

654
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:23,166
Yes, I've been coordinating
with PSP.

655
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:24,743
Do we have a strategy in place?

656
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:26,335
It's already underway.

657
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,382
By the activity level behind me,

658
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,560
it is evident that a plan to stop
the runaway train is underway.

659
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:46,560
But so far, no one at AWVR
is commenting.

660
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,438
We just witnessed A WVR employee,
Ryan Scott

661
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:55,364
boarding one of the rescue helicopters.

662
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:58,864
He is a 22 year old Marine vet who
has just returned from Afghanistan.

663
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,202
What the hell is this?
I need a police escort now!

664
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,327
Whoa!

665
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,697
It says here you're a welder.

666
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:12,298
Lead welder.

667
00:40:12,385 --> 00:40:14,166
Listen buddy, I don't got
a lot of time.

668
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:16,253
Look! you can call my yardmaster,
Connie Hooper!

669
00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:23,067
Connie sent you?

670
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:23,868
That's what I said.

671
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:25,306
I need your help.

672
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:35,817
1206, this is dispatch.

673
00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:39,025
1206, we ran the math. At over
2000, you wouldn't have fit.

674
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:41,277
Good call, over.

675
00:40:42,248 --> 00:40:45,331
Thank you but I need to know
where that oncoming train is.

676
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:47,408
How far away is it?

677
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,543
1206, we're not exactly sure.

678
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,520
You're not sure?
Well, find out!

679
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:58,628
I'm high above central Pennsylvania.
This train got away...

680
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:01,631
<i>Emergency responders want to
halt all activity near the line</i>

681
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:03,849
<i>and possibly evacuate all homes</i>

682
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:05,647
<i>within a mile radius of
the tracks.</i>

683
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,872
<i>There's thousands of gallons of fuel
onboard, which is highly flammable.</i>

684
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,107
<i>But we're still awaiting
word on that.</i>

685
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,659
This is Galvin's strategy?

686
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:30,968
Looks like they're putting
a train in front of 777

687
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,461
in an attempt to slow it down.

688
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:37,879
Now, they are sending a chopper
with Ryan Scott

689
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,837
and the railroad company is
still refusing to comment.

690
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,853
We've just learned that 26 year rail
company veteran Judd Stewart

691
00:41:56,989 --> 00:41:58,354
is at the controls of the engine

692
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,905
that is in front of the runaway train.

693
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,094
This is Connie Hooper
from Fuller Yard.

694
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:27,721
Is this your guy coming off
the helicopter?

695
00:42:40,032 --> 00:42:41,488
Still holding at 55.

696
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:43,970
Get her down to 40
and keep braking.

697
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:22,299
Shit!

698
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,328
That's it, keep going.
Keep slowing.

699
00:43:37,673 --> 00:43:39,664
Get her down to 40 and we'll
set our boy down.

700
00:43:53,856 --> 00:43:55,336
Unbelievable!

701
00:43:55,483 --> 00:43:56,643
Do this!

702
00:43:57,117 --> 00:43:57,877
Come on.

703
00:43:57,994 --> 00:43:59,604
<i>incredibly dangerous...</i>

704
00:44:13,376 --> 00:44:15,362
Do this, Judd.
Come on!

705
00:44:25,638 --> 00:44:27,448
I'm under 40.
Is he on yet?

706
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:31,844
Now!

707
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:53,450
Looks like Marine Ryan Scott
has been injured.

708
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:54,732
It's a no go.

709
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:55,933
Slow down!

710
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:59,480
Just keep braking, try to slow it.
Try to get 777 off the main.

711
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,605
Switch has been thrown.

712
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,225
Slow down, God damn it!

713
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:22,559
Don't side it yet!
It's going too fast.

714
00:45:40,629 --> 00:45:41,960
Bail! Bail! Bail!

715
00:45:59,732 --> 00:46:02,168
Holy shit!

716
00:46:03,152 --> 00:46:04,908
Maybe it derailed.

717
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:09,947
Wow! I can't believe
how crazy that was.

718
00:46:10,618 --> 00:46:12,859
Oh my God!
Galvin, you asshole!

719
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,554
Fuller Yard, Fuller Yard.
This is 1206.

720
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:45,141
We're passing milepost 52,
heading northbound on the Main 1.

721
00:46:45,486 --> 00:46:47,017
1206, who am I  speaking with?

722
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,485
Frank Barnes, the engineer.

723
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,483
This is Connie Hooper,
yardmaster at Fuller.

724
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,690
Why are you still on
the mainline?

725
00:46:52,785 --> 00:46:54,992
We were directed to a siding
that's a no go.

726
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:58,788
We're heading to a rip track
just past milepost 5-0.

727
00:46:58,874 --> 00:47:01,365
We need to know the location
of your yard's train.

728
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,294
It just passed milepost 47.

729
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:07,267
Holy shit.

730
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:18,307
They tried to side it but it jumped
the switch and derailed the lash-up.

731
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,725
Lash-up?
Who was driving?

732
00:47:20,855 --> 00:47:23,688
<i>The engineer, a 26-year rail
company veteran,</i>

733
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:27,107
was killed earlier today in Keating
Summit, central Pennsylvania.

734
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:28,883
Judd Stewart.

735
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,936
Stewart?

736
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:32,689
You said Stewart?

737
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,631
Judd Stewart, an engineer
from Brewster.

738
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,106
You know him?

739
00:47:50,885 --> 00:47:52,375
What's your power on the point?

740
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,095
5000 horses, she's not a hotshot,

741
00:47:56,182 --> 00:47:59,069
but she's still got some life
left in her, over.

742
00:47:59,226 --> 00:48:02,018
Give her all you got, tell Galvin we
got two guys out on the mainline

743
00:48:02,154 --> 00:48:03,719
about to play chicken with
our train.

744
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:14,195
- We tried to stop it. We blew it.
- What?

745
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:15,906
That train got to go down.

746
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,654
The only question is how to
minimize the damage.

747
00:48:17,745 --> 00:48:18,434
Be quiet!

748
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:21,411
We just learned there is yet
another train on this track,

749
00:48:21,749 --> 00:48:23,660
headed directly at the runaway.

750
00:48:24,043 --> 00:48:25,579
What the hell is this?

751
00:48:26,045 --> 00:48:29,208
We gotta learn about it on,
damn TV?

752
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,891
Nicole listen, don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

753
00:48:46,982 --> 00:48:48,347
Dad, I'm busy, okay?

754
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:49,773
Okay, I understand.
I just...

755
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,941
- Dad?
- I just wanted to tell you that I love you.

756
00:48:52,071 --> 00:48:54,483
Okay fine!
Dad, what's wrong?

757
00:48:54,573 --> 00:48:57,014
Nothing, nothing.
I just...

758
00:48:59,286 --> 00:49:00,696
Dad, what's wrong?

759
00:49:01,255 --> 00:49:04,697
Just tell your sister I love you
both, okay? I got to go.

760
00:49:06,627 --> 00:49:08,492
What's wrong?

761
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,754
1206, how are you holding up?

762
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:23,090
About a half a mile from
that rip track, over.

763
00:49:23,185 --> 00:49:26,018
Chances are, you're going to see
777's nose any minute now.

764
00:49:26,105 --> 00:49:27,640
Affirmative!

765
00:49:41,036 --> 00:49:42,446
Why are you braking?

766
00:49:42,538 --> 00:49:45,280
Trust me, if we head in this hot,
we'll tear right off the track.

767
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:49,191
Oh Jesus.

768
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:56,332
Get her down to 40 and
brace yourself.

769
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,304
You need to get at least
10 cars into the siding.

770
00:50:09,356 --> 00:50:10,562
Yes!

771
00:50:47,186 --> 00:50:50,053
Frank, go to 6.
Frank, go to 6.

772
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:52,600
Yeah, I'm at 6, go!

773
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,090
They're evacuating Arklow.

774
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:57,300
They're going to derail
the train.

775
00:50:57,863 --> 00:50:58,818
What are they using?

776
00:50:58,906 --> 00:51:00,897
Standard DRE.

777
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:03,039
Yeah, a portable derailer.

778
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:08,887
What are you doing?

779
00:51:09,175 --> 00:51:11,991
I got a look at that train's last
coupler knuckle, it was open.

780
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,660
We take off right now,
we get back on the main.

781
00:51:14,755 --> 00:51:16,336
We can chase it down in reverse.

782
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:17,663
Chase?
Whoa, wait a minute.

783
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:20,465
The only way to stop that kind
of power, grab it by the tail.

784
00:51:20,552 --> 00:51:21,837
Boom, gun it in the
opposite direction.

785
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:23,169
We can't just chase it down.
If it goes down,

786
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,173
we're gonna be a wreck
on a wreck.

787
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:29,358
Doesn't matter, there's a good
chance the derailer won't work.

788
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,602
It's called a derailer
for Christ's sake!

789
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:33,179
- That's what they do!
- A train that size

790
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:36,356
going that fast, it will vaporize
anything that gets in its way.

791
00:51:36,443 --> 00:51:37,933
Bullshit!
They wouldn't use it if...

792
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,440
They're wrong, alright?
They're wrong.

793
00:51:41,115 --> 00:51:42,400
Are you in or are you out?

794
00:51:42,491 --> 00:51:44,527
If you want to get yourself
killed, you do it alone.

795
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:46,979
You know what? Ask your
wife what she thinks.

796
00:51:47,413 --> 00:51:48,778
Wait!

797
00:51:52,626 --> 00:51:54,537
If you're right and that
derailer fails,

798
00:51:54,628 --> 00:51:56,493
what are the odds it
makes it to Stanton?

799
00:51:56,672 --> 00:51:59,084
You saw the train,
what do you think?

800
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:27,650
1206, this is Connie Hooper.
Are you there?

801
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,410
1206, over.

802
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:32,362
Just wanted to see how
you boys are doing.

803
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:38,419
We're doing about 60
mile an hour, Connie.

804
00:52:38,714 --> 00:52:41,376
Sorry?
Frank, I don't understand.

805
00:52:41,508 --> 00:52:43,499
We're going after your train.

806
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:45,550
1206, I'm not hearing you.

807
00:52:45,637 --> 00:52:47,127
The rear knuckle was left open.

808
00:52:47,222 --> 00:52:49,713
So if we can catch up, we can
tie it on to our locomotive.

809
00:52:49,808 --> 00:52:51,344
Try and slow down 777.

810
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:52,595
Frank, you can't.

811
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:53,801
We already are.

812
00:52:53,896 --> 00:52:55,602
Portable derailer's not
gonna cut it, Connie.

813
00:52:56,231 --> 00:52:57,846
Who said anything
about a derailer?

814
00:52:58,317 --> 00:53:01,104
Dispatch, they said that they're
evacuating Arklow.

815
00:53:01,195 --> 00:53:02,275
Two plus two is four.

816
00:53:03,864 --> 00:53:05,200
It's Ned. He said he's still
following... No, No, No.

817
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:07,823
Tell him I'll call him back.
Get me Galvin, now!

818
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,698
Frank, that train's carrying 30,000
gallons of toxic chemicals.

819
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:15,539
They had a window before but that
train going into populated areas.

820
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,036
There's no way they'd
derail it now.

821
00:53:19,421 --> 00:53:20,706
Are you sure about that?

822
00:53:22,508 --> 00:53:24,123
Look, let me make some calls.

823
00:53:24,426 --> 00:53:26,417
Make some calls, please.

824
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,060
What do you think? Do you
think they can catch up?

825
00:53:38,565 --> 00:53:40,851
Possibly.
But even if they do,

826
00:53:40,943 --> 00:53:44,435
we're talking about coupling at 10
times the normal speed in reverse.

827
00:53:45,447 --> 00:53:47,278
I thought you were in favor
of derailment.

828
00:53:47,366 --> 00:53:49,652
Yeah, when they were in the
middle of nowhere not now.

829
00:53:49,743 --> 00:53:51,233
It's just town after town
out there!

830
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,068
Mr Galvin says he'd have
to call you back.

831
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,245
This is Connie Hooper for
Mr Galvin.

832
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,372
Mr Galvin is in a meeting.

833
00:53:56,508 --> 00:53:59,916
Then maybe you can tell me. Is the
company planning on derailing 777?

834
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,494
Last I heard, Galvin was dead
set against it.

835
00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:04,329
<i>I'm sorry, I'd really like
to help you, Miss Hooper.</i>

836
00:54:04,424 --> 00:54:06,005
<i>But I'm not at liberty to
give you that information.</i>

837
00:54:06,093 --> 00:54:08,425
No, of course you're not
at liberty to.

838
00:54:08,887 --> 00:54:10,423
Frank is right.

839
00:54:17,604 --> 00:54:20,141
What's the fastest you've taken
a single engine like this?

840
00:54:20,941 --> 00:54:22,056
- Unattached?
- Yeah.

841
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,106
Fifty, 55.

842
00:54:25,353 --> 00:54:26,438
Of course, I was going forward.

843
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,403
1206, you there?

844
00:54:29,116 --> 00:54:30,447
This is 1206, over.

845
00:54:30,576 --> 00:54:31,861
Frank, you're right,

846
00:54:31,952 --> 00:54:32,889
about the derailment.

847
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,536
They're planning an attempt
outside of Arklow.

848
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,371
Tell them idiots, it ain't
gonna work.

849
00:54:41,503 --> 00:54:43,209
That portable derailer,
it's worthless.

850
00:54:43,297 --> 00:54:44,962
She already told us.

851
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:49,459
Frank, this is Oscar Galvin
VP of Operations,

852
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:52,295
patched in at his request,
open mike.

853
00:54:52,731 --> 00:54:57,140
Yeah, we're derailing 777, Frank.
It's a done decision.

854
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,718
Like it or not, it's our
best option at this stage.

855
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:02,145
There'll be less collateral
damage in Arklow.

856
00:55:02,524 --> 00:55:03,934
It's already being evacuated,

857
00:55:04,026 --> 00:55:06,693
and we can't let 777
make it to Stanton.

858
00:55:06,787 --> 00:55:09,103
Look! Mr Galvin with all
due respect,

859
00:55:09,197 --> 00:55:10,812
I've been railroading 28 years.

860
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,149
I'm telling you, we got a real
chance to stop this thing.

861
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,654
No, we already tried.

862
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:19,159
That was from the front.
We're long hood lead back.

863
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:22,286
It's a different situation.
We got more control now.

864
00:55:25,172 --> 00:55:28,063
What if I cancel the derailer
and you fail, Frank?

865
00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:30,386
That train will be doing
70 miles an hour

866
00:55:30,477 --> 00:55:32,759
into that elevated s-curve
in Stanton.

867
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:34,632
The damage will be
a 100 times worse.

868
00:55:34,923 --> 00:55:39,087
Right! I'm just telling you, the
portable derailer is worthless.

869
00:55:39,353 --> 00:55:42,060
You got too much train
traveling entirely too fast.

870
00:55:42,856 --> 00:55:45,548
Maybe 1206 should just
stay on it as a backup.

871
00:55:45,684 --> 00:55:49,902
Look, I am not jeopardizing more
personnel and more property,

872
00:55:49,997 --> 00:55:52,984
just because some engineer
wants to play hero.

873
00:55:53,175 --> 00:55:54,861
End of discussion!

874
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:58,202
That train is our property,
it's our decision!

875
00:55:59,373 --> 00:56:02,581
Now you stop your pursuit
or I will fire you!

876
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:05,292
Fire? You already did.

877
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,540
Already did what?

878
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:14,492
You've already fired me.

879
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:20,178
I received my 90-day notice
in the mail, 72 days ago.

880
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:23,222
Forced early retirement,
with half benefits.

881
00:56:31,029 --> 00:56:34,863
So you're going to risk your life
for us with three weeks left.

882
00:56:36,618 --> 00:56:38,028
Not for you.

883
00:56:39,746 --> 00:56:41,456
I'm not doing it for you.

884
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,240
Frank! let me see that thing.

885
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:52,372
Mr Galvin, this is Will Colson,
your conductor.

886
00:56:55,562 --> 00:56:58,399
I'm letting you know, we're
going to run this bitch down.

887
00:56:58,932 --> 00:57:02,720
Maybe you didn't hear what I just
said, Colson. I will fire you!

888
00:57:04,071 --> 00:57:08,514
Well, that's too bad. I was just
starting to like this job.

889
00:57:10,577 --> 00:57:15,191
God damn it, you listen to me!
You son of a bitch! You will be fired!

890
00:57:15,282 --> 00:57:18,740
You're breaking up.
Sorry, you're...

891
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:26,373
- This garbage is...
- Sir, I think they're gone.

892
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,871
This is your headache now, Hooper.

893
00:57:31,965 --> 00:57:36,299
Now you get them off the main or
consider yourself shit-canned, too!

894
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:39,385
I like them.

895
00:57:40,098 --> 00:57:42,054
Bring up Beech Siding
to Arklow.

896
00:57:42,601 --> 00:57:45,413
Take a look behind me, you can see
emergency evacuation measures

897
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:48,741
are currently in effect right here
in the tiny town of Arklow.

898
00:57:54,154 --> 00:57:55,769
The lash-up was a no go.

899
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:03,319
1206 to Fuller Yard. Connie,
are you there, over.

900
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:06,075
Frank, I'm real sorry
about Galvin.

901
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:07,997
That's okay.
Listen, listen. Is he off?

902
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,120
Yeah, he's gone.

903
00:58:09,211 --> 00:58:10,792
Okay, listen up.

904
00:58:10,879 --> 00:58:12,369
I'm going to need you
to do us a favor.

905
00:58:12,464 --> 00:58:16,503
I need you to keep us posted on
the speed and location of 777.

906
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,208
Location and speed, over.

907
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,136
Connie?

908
00:58:24,226 --> 00:58:26,262
Frank, 777's nine miles
out of Arklow.

909
00:58:26,353 --> 00:58:27,593
You got some catching
up to do.

910
00:58:27,687 --> 00:58:29,018
9 miles out of Arklow.

911
00:58:44,704 --> 00:58:46,615
What did you say your wife's
first name was?

912
00:58:46,706 --> 00:58:47,641
Darcy.

913
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:49,869
So, what was the long story
you didn't want to make long?

914
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:54,424
I come home from work,
2 weeks ago

915
00:58:54,514 --> 00:58:56,670
and she's texting on the phone.

916
00:58:56,758 --> 00:58:59,420
I ask her who with?
She says, "Nobody".

917
00:59:00,095 --> 00:59:01,801
I say, "Let me see the
phone". She says no.

918
00:59:01,888 --> 00:59:04,345
This goes on, about 5 or 6 times.

919
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:06,931
Wait, you're losing me.
She's texting...

920
00:59:07,185 --> 00:59:08,700
There's this guy we both
went to school with.

921
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,056
He's a cop, he's a PA
state trooper.

922
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:13,810
He's always had a thing for Darcy.
Going way back.

923
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,436
1206, where are you?

924
00:59:15,527 --> 00:59:19,315
1206 here, Connie. We're just
passing milepost 5-7.

925
00:59:19,406 --> 00:59:21,367
You're about a mile
and a half behind.

926
00:59:23,451 --> 00:59:25,442
How far out of Arklow is 777?

927
00:59:25,537 --> 00:59:28,153
Seven and a half miles. It picked
up speed, you better step on it.

928
00:59:28,248 --> 00:59:30,280
I'm stepping on it, in it, around
it and through it, Connie.

929
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,248
Thank you, over.

930
00:59:33,253 --> 00:59:37,116
She's texting on the phone. I keep on
asking for it, she keeps on saying no.

931
00:59:38,049 --> 00:59:40,456
She starts to walk away
and I grab for it.

932
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,384
- You hit her?
- No, no, no.

933
00:59:45,265 --> 00:59:48,177
I mean I scared her,
but I didn't hit her.

934
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:51,892
Anyway, I drive to
this guy's house...

935
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,316
and tell him we need to talk.
Let's take a ride.

936
00:59:53,407 --> 00:59:55,438
He jumps in my truck
and starts in with...

937
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:58,016
"You got it all wrong,
we're just friends".

938
00:59:58,111 --> 01:00:00,227
Then he stops once he sees...

939
01:00:01,072 --> 01:00:02,838
the gun I got sitting
on the dash.

940
01:00:02,939 --> 01:00:04,039
Oh!

941
01:00:05,327 --> 01:00:08,615
I look him in the eye and say,
"she's my wife, you find a new friend."

942
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,070
You pulled a gun on a cop?

943
01:00:10,165 --> 01:00:11,530
Frank?

944
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:14,788
Frank, 777 just passed
milepost 61.

945
01:00:16,087 --> 01:00:17,293
Thank you, Connie.

946
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,291
- You want to hear the kicker?
- Yes, I do.

947
01:00:20,592 --> 01:00:21,929
It wasn't even him
that was texting her,

948
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:23,630
it was my sister-in-law.

949
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:27,884
Anyway, by the time I got home,
his buddy's waiting for me.

950
01:00:27,974 --> 01:00:31,091
Just waiting to serve me
with this restraining order.

951
01:00:33,271 --> 01:00:35,027
Darcy wouldn't even look at me.

952
01:00:38,193 --> 01:00:40,809
So I'm living with my brother.

953
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:43,987
There was a hearing today. The
judge ordered a 30-day extension.

954
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:50,156
It's like one day everything's
going okay and then...

955
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,478
And the next, it's all
falling apart faster

956
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:53,906
than you can put it
back together.

957
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,286
Yeah, never too late though.

958
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:08,791
The plan to derail this
39-car runaway train,

959
01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:10,888
is just minutes away now.

960
01:01:10,976 --> 01:01:13,012
There's a tremendous amount
of activity going on.

961
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:16,220
Will this train be able
to be stopped?

962
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:21,645
1206, Connie. We're just
passing milepost 6-2.

963
01:01:21,736 --> 01:01:23,146
Milepost 6-2, over.

964
01:01:23,238 --> 01:01:24,853
Still a mile gap, maybe more.

965
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:26,688
We're not gaining
on her, Frank.

966
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:28,857
Hold on.

967
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:36,072
It's just like the
shooting range!

968
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:37,859
Alright, here we go!
Come on! Let's go!

969
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,060
This is it! It's game time!

970
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:47,467
And remember, we're aiming
for the red circular button!

971
01:01:52,659 --> 01:01:53,839
Now!

972
01:01:56,062 --> 01:01:57,780
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

973
01:01:57,781 --> 01:01:59,681
You're shooting the fuel cap.
God damn it!

974
01:01:59,774 --> 01:02:01,139
Hold your fire!

975
01:02:01,234 --> 01:02:03,816
We were aiming to disable it
by firing shotgun rounds

976
01:02:03,903 --> 01:02:08,237
at a fuel stop safety switch,
and so some shots were fired.

977
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:11,237
That safety switch is
a mighty small target.

978
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:13,740
And it's right next
to a fuel tank.

979
01:02:18,585 --> 01:02:20,496
We're not gonna catch it
before Arklow.

980
01:02:20,587 --> 01:02:23,479
Frank, you're closing the gap.
You should cut your speed.

981
01:02:23,515 --> 01:02:26,001
Allow yourself some stopping
distance, just in case.

982
01:02:26,092 --> 01:02:28,799
No can do, Connie. If we slow
down now, we'll never catch it.

983
01:02:28,887 --> 01:02:30,343
Not before Stanton, over.

984
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:31,761
It's your call.

985
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:35,932
However, we have now also learned
that two railroad employees,

986
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:40,433
are now in pursuit of train
777 in a single locomotive.

987
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,188
It is unclear,
what their plan is...

988
01:02:42,283 --> 01:02:44,390
Connie Hooper for you.

989
01:02:44,778 --> 01:02:48,111
Did I or did I not tell you
to get 1206 off the main?

990
01:02:48,198 --> 01:02:49,608
I asked them nicely.

991
01:02:55,955 --> 01:02:58,287
You're 100 percent sure that
derailer won't work?

992
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,741
Yes, 100 percent?
No.

993
01:03:00,835 --> 01:03:01,950
Which one is it?

994
01:03:04,839 --> 01:03:06,875
- 50-50.
- Pretty funny.

995
01:03:06,966 --> 01:03:09,082
And if it does?

996
01:03:09,177 --> 01:03:12,965
If it does then, we're
a wreck on a wreck.

997
01:03:14,474 --> 01:03:16,385
I'm here with FRA official
Gene Devereaux.

998
01:03:16,476 --> 01:03:18,592
This train is getting close.
How is this going to work?

999
01:03:18,686 --> 01:03:21,423
Basically, it works like a ramp.

1000
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,646
The train comes along,

1001
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:27,601
this piece here will lift the flange
and pull it outside the rail.

1002
01:03:27,695 --> 01:03:31,734
That will cause the train to flip
over on its right-hand side.

1003
01:03:31,825 --> 01:03:33,406
Son of a bitch won't even
know what hit it.

1004
01:03:41,793 --> 01:03:43,704
Train's about four minutes out!

1005
01:03:43,795 --> 01:03:45,160
Guys, come on.
Get it started!

1006
01:03:45,713 --> 01:03:46,919
Guys, come on!

1007
01:04:10,195 --> 01:04:10,595
<i>It has not succeeded...</i>

1008
01:04:10,696 --> 01:04:11,857
What?

1009
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:13,233
What in the hell was that?

1010
01:04:13,324 --> 01:04:17,442
That was 10 million pounds
of train, Mr Galvin!

1011
01:04:17,537 --> 01:04:19,823
And this is the sound
of me saving your ass!

1012
01:04:20,748 --> 01:04:21,988
Frank, do you copy?

1013
01:04:22,709 --> 01:04:24,165
Frank?

1014
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:25,704
This is 1206, over.

1015
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,877
You were right.
It barely bumped.

1016
01:04:29,174 --> 01:04:30,880
Jesus Christ.

1017
01:04:39,392 --> 01:04:41,348
We're bringing you live
coverage right now

1018
01:04:41,436 --> 01:04:44,269
on what could very well result
in one of the worst disasters

1019
01:04:44,355 --> 01:04:47,472
in the history of the
state of Pennsylvania.

1020
01:04:47,567 --> 01:04:49,478
Now, the particulars are
still being examined,

1021
01:04:49,569 --> 01:04:51,605
but authorities are far
more focused

1022
01:04:51,696 --> 01:04:55,114
on the potential destruction
that would result if train 777

1023
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,773
were to derail in Stanton.

1024
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,576
What'd you mean about
being married once?

1025
01:05:06,419 --> 01:05:08,501
Alice my wife,
she died of cancer.

1026
01:05:09,088 --> 01:05:10,828
- Four years ago.
- I'm sorry.

1027
01:05:10,924 --> 01:05:12,414
Me too.

1028
01:05:13,259 --> 01:05:14,465
Me too.

1029
01:05:17,238 --> 01:05:20,426
Every night I'd come home,
tell her about my day.

1030
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:24,054
Where I'd been,
what I hauled,

1031
01:05:27,148 --> 01:05:28,263
who annoyed me.

1032
01:05:29,609 --> 01:05:31,349
Guess I would have made
the evening report, huh?

1033
01:05:31,444 --> 01:05:33,435
Yes, you would have
made it, definitely.

1034
01:05:35,448 --> 01:05:37,109
You should call your wife.

1035
01:05:37,992 --> 01:05:41,155
I would but it's her day off.
She's probably sleeping.

1036
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:43,612
Don't make excuses.
Wake her up.

1037
01:05:44,624 --> 01:05:45,955
Been calling for the
past two weeks.

1038
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,277
She still hasn't called me back.

1039
01:05:47,368 --> 01:05:49,250
She won't, you got to call her.

1040
01:05:49,337 --> 01:05:51,749
Don't you know how that works?
You quit too easy.

1041
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:01,129
Darcy!

1042
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,134
Darcy!

1043
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:07,352
I have been calling and calling.

1044
01:06:09,274 --> 01:06:10,605
What is wrong?

1045
01:06:10,692 --> 01:06:14,059
As we told you earlier today,
those emergency evacuations

1046
01:06:14,153 --> 01:06:18,146
began early this morning as they try
to move people out of harm's way.

1047
01:06:18,324 --> 01:06:20,986
You get a sense of the perimeter here.
You see the firefighters...

1048
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,539
Hey, it's me.
Yeah, we're on our way.

1049
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,662
Yeah, I know.
I'm watching it.

1050
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:47,972
Two railroad employees are
presently in pursuit of train 777,

1051
01:06:48,062 --> 01:06:49,427
in a single locomotive.

1052
01:06:49,522 --> 01:06:52,434
No one seems exactly clear
on what their plans are,

1053
01:06:52,525 --> 01:06:54,186
should they catch up
to that train.

1054
01:06:54,277 --> 01:06:55,517
It's Dad.

1055
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:58,103
We have just learned that railroad
employee, Frank Barnes

1056
01:06:58,197 --> 01:07:01,735
a 28 year veteran of the freight
company responsible for the runaway,

1057
01:07:01,826 --> 01:07:05,239
and Will Colson, a conductor, are
now onboard another locomotive.

1058
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,365
We're on our way.

1059
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:08,321
A single locomotive trying
to catch up

1060
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:09,622
to the runaway train.
She's gotta get dressed.

1061
01:07:09,709 --> 01:07:11,324
And get this, they were
traveling... I can tell.

1062
01:07:11,419 --> 01:07:12,299
She'll be ready in a minute.

1063
01:07:12,387 --> 01:07:14,373
<i>...at speeds of up to 70
miles an hour in reverse.</i>

1064
01:07:14,464 --> 01:07:16,346
<i>777 is now just miles away
from the significantly...</i>

1065
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:18,544
Come on Darcy, let's go.
Come on, get dressed.

1066
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:20,546
<i>...more populated
town of Stanton.</i>

1067
01:07:24,223 --> 01:07:25,633
Let's go, boys!

1068
01:07:45,912 --> 01:07:46,992
Okay, you're getting close.

1069
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,662
The gap's at a mile and 777
is 10 miles to Stanton.

1070
01:07:49,749 --> 01:07:52,991
Now listen, Frank. I got a guy here
named Werner from the FRA.

1071
01:07:53,086 --> 01:07:55,077
Now, I'm inclined to defer to
your judgment here but he...

1072
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:58,334
Alright, put him on. We could
use all the help we can get.

1073
01:07:59,926 --> 01:08:01,791
Just press this and
hold to talk.

1074
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:06,679
It's about slowing 777
once you've tied on.

1075
01:08:06,766 --> 01:08:08,631
I know conventional
wisdom says

1076
01:08:08,726 --> 01:08:11,263
to just gun it in the
opposite direction.

1077
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,265
But you'll have a better shot

1078
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:16,189
alternating full throttle
with dynamic braking.

1079
01:08:16,275 --> 01:08:18,607
Yeah, but we can't afford
to lose counterthrust.

1080
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,614
Well,what you'll lose
in counterthrust,

1081
01:08:20,705 --> 01:08:22,645
you'll compensate for
in tractive force.

1082
01:08:23,116 --> 01:08:24,556
Are you sure about that?

1083
01:08:27,453 --> 01:08:30,160
Well, it's more of a hunch based
on some quick calculations.

1084
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:32,363
It's a hunch.

1085
01:08:33,459 --> 01:08:35,575
I'm 70 miles an hour and he's
giving us a hunch.

1086
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:38,503
Okay, thank you.
Put Connie back on, please.

1087
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:39,574
It's me, Frank.

1088
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:42,799
Yeah, Connie. Does this guy
know what he's talking about?

1089
01:08:44,178 --> 01:08:45,964
In a perfect world.

1090
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,846
Yes, I'd say yes.

1091
01:08:48,933 --> 01:08:50,719
In a perfect world, okay.

1092
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:54,177
We have more now on that runaway
freight train in rural Pennsylvania.

1093
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:57,181
They've devised an ambitious
plan to bring it to a stop.

1094
01:08:57,275 --> 01:09:00,062
A single locomotive moves in
from behind,

1095
01:09:00,153 --> 01:09:04,317
catches up, hooks up and then brakes
in an effort to slow it down.

1096
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:08,695
Passing milepost 7-6,
Connie, over.

1097
01:09:08,953 --> 01:09:10,409
You're only a half mile away.

1098
01:09:10,496 --> 01:09:11,906
Half a mile, out.

1099
01:09:12,206 --> 01:09:14,788
Frank, running in reverse. How are
you gonna gauge our gap distance?

1100
01:09:17,545 --> 01:09:20,002
I could go out there.
I could signal you by hand.

1101
01:09:21,841 --> 01:09:22,621
At 70 mile an hour?

1102
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:23,998
I'm asking, would it help?

1103
01:09:27,847 --> 01:09:30,133
Alright, radio and hand signals.

1104
01:09:30,224 --> 01:09:32,180
We'll combinate.
And be careful.

1105
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,428
I will.

1106
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:34,767
And take that vest off too.

1107
01:09:34,854 --> 01:09:36,594
- Why?
- Just take it off.

1108
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:37,478
I don't want to look out
this window

1109
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:39,810
and see you in that yellow
vest. It'll freak me out.

1110
01:09:58,878 --> 01:09:59,867
Come on, Will.

1111
01:10:03,174 --> 01:10:04,289
Pick up.
Come on.

1112
01:10:04,425 --> 01:10:05,585
<i>This is Will,
leave me a message.</i>

1113
01:10:05,676 --> 01:10:06,961
Damn!

1114
01:10:12,517 --> 01:10:13,677
Ten cars, Frank!

1115
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,425
Affirmative, over.

1116
01:10:21,192 --> 01:10:22,432
Alright, here she comes!

1117
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:28,191
Three cars?

1118
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,731
Three cars steady.
Copy.

1119
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,912
Alright.
Steady, steady!

1120
01:10:44,465 --> 01:10:45,875
Two cars?

1121
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,342
Yeah, two cars.
Copy.

1122
01:10:49,428 --> 01:10:50,759
Steady, over.

1123
01:10:54,433 --> 01:10:56,389
Keep it coming!
keep it coming!

1124
01:11:00,982 --> 01:11:02,347
Keep it coming!

1125
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,515
Steady, steady!

1126
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:08,853
<i>Will Colson is trying
to hook up 1206</i>

1127
01:11:08,948 --> 01:11:10,484
- with 777.
- Oh my God.

1128
01:11:15,162 --> 01:11:17,448
<i>Something has gone
terribly wrong.</i>

1129
01:11:23,504 --> 01:11:25,290
Will, what was that?

1130
01:11:26,757 --> 01:11:28,247
The grain car blew a seal!

1131
01:11:29,802 --> 01:11:31,383
Are we tied off?

1132
01:11:33,139 --> 01:11:34,345
Will, what's going on?

1133
01:11:35,933 --> 01:11:39,801
<i>Right now we are looking at live
pictures of this rescue operation.</i>

1134
01:11:40,271 --> 01:11:41,636
Are we tied off?

1135
01:11:42,773 --> 01:11:45,389
No Frank, it didn't work.
Our knuckle closed!

1136
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:48,191
Will, use hand signals!
Hand signals!

1137
01:11:57,705 --> 01:11:58,990
We tied on?

1138
01:11:59,165 --> 01:12:00,450
We're good! We're good!

1139
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:01,747
What?

1140
01:12:08,841 --> 01:12:10,377
Oh shit.

1141
01:12:11,177 --> 01:12:12,883
Frank, the pin didn't fall!

1142
01:12:13,012 --> 01:12:14,752
Say again.
The what?

1143
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:17,092
Will, are we tied on?

1144
01:12:17,183 --> 01:12:19,640
It's not gonna work.
The pin didn't fall.

1145
01:12:19,727 --> 01:12:20,762
What?

1146
01:12:20,853 --> 01:12:23,811
The pin didn't fall!
It's not locking!

1147
01:12:24,148 --> 01:12:25,934
Alright, well, look.

1148
01:12:26,025 --> 01:12:29,142
Try and get down there and see
what you can do. Be careful!

1149
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,060
Be careful.

1150
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:41,453
Will!

1151
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:44,623
It's not slowing down.
It's gaining speed right now.

1152
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:46,701
He's reaching down,
trying to couple...

1153
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,465
Will, can you read me?

1154
01:13:11,696 --> 01:13:12,856
He's gone!

1155
01:13:16,742 --> 01:13:20,200
Will Colson is down.
We do not see him.

1156
01:13:21,747 --> 01:13:23,487
Chopper 43, can you zoom in?

1157
01:13:24,417 --> 01:13:27,375
We do not see the conductor,
Colson, Come on baby.

1158
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:34,923
Will, can you read me?
Will!

1159
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,682
Chopper 43, zoom in.
There he is. Will Colson.

1160
01:13:54,697 --> 01:13:57,029
As he struggles to pull
himself up,

1161
01:13:57,116 --> 01:13:59,448
looks like Will Colson
is in trouble.

1162
01:14:07,793 --> 01:14:09,158
The train is coupled.

1163
01:14:09,253 --> 01:14:12,871
I'm now being told that the
connection has been made.

1164
01:14:12,965 --> 01:14:15,547
It looks as though this
train is now attached.

1165
01:14:15,634 --> 01:14:19,673
1206 has been successfully
attached to 777.

1166
01:14:19,764 --> 01:14:22,631
But it looks like
Will Colson is injured.

1167
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,429
You Alright?

1168
01:14:27,813 --> 01:14:29,144
I'm great.

1169
01:14:30,441 --> 01:14:32,352
Hey, hey, don't touch that!
Don't touch that boot!

1170
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:34,892
Here, just wrap it up
with this.

1171
01:14:34,987 --> 01:14:37,103
Wrap it real tight,
all around.

1172
01:14:37,698 --> 01:14:38,858
You okay?

1173
01:14:38,949 --> 01:14:40,905
I'm Alright.
I'm Alright.

1174
01:14:42,828 --> 01:14:45,786
Barnes and Colson have caught
up to the runaway train.

1175
01:14:45,873 --> 01:14:47,704
Darcy. come on. Come on.

1176
01:14:47,792 --> 01:14:51,660
But the train continues to speed
in excess of 75 miles an hour,

1177
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:52,914
heading to Stanton.

1178
01:14:56,175 --> 01:14:57,540
Connie, how far we got?

1179
01:14:57,635 --> 01:14:59,842
How far to Stanton? Over.

1180
01:15:01,388 --> 01:15:03,674
4 miles.
You guys are doing great.

1181
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:05,051
You're cutting it close, though.

1182
01:15:05,142 --> 01:15:06,507
How's Will?

1183
01:15:07,353 --> 01:15:10,345
He's...
He's different, over.

1184
01:15:13,651 --> 01:15:15,516
Ready for a little
tug-of-war?

1185
01:15:16,362 --> 01:15:17,522
Let's do it.

1186
01:15:26,247 --> 01:15:29,239
Match our speed with theirs.

1187
01:15:36,215 --> 01:15:38,456
Frank, we're gonna snap right off.
No, we're not, we're not.

1188
01:15:38,551 --> 01:15:42,043
We're just stretching, that's all.
We're just stretching.

1189
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:48,223
Here in Stanton,

1190
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:51,643
the evacuation procedures
continue for the entire town.

1191
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:56,224
This is the town where that mainline train
track turns into an elevated curve.

1192
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,274
They say there is virtually
no chance

1193
01:15:58,362 --> 01:16:00,273
this speeding,
out-of-control train

1194
01:16:00,364 --> 01:16:01,945
will make it through
that curve.

1195
01:16:08,539 --> 01:16:10,575
We should be slowing down.

1196
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,327
Which we're not.

1197
01:16:12,418 --> 01:16:14,204
Shoot.

1198
01:16:15,296 --> 01:16:18,788
Go to the dynamic.
Alternate full throttle.

1199
01:16:30,811 --> 01:16:32,676
Christ! Those cab brakes
are getting a workout.

1200
01:16:32,771 --> 01:16:35,353
...because of the highly
toxic nature of the cargo.

1201
01:16:35,441 --> 01:16:36,476
Come on, Frank.

1202
01:16:36,817 --> 01:16:38,432
Come on baby.

1203
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:43,028
Ah!

1204
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,690
What's our speed?

1205
01:16:45,826 --> 01:16:47,111
We're under 50.

1206
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,034
Connie, how far away?

1207
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:51,783
Three miles. FRA's got men on the
ground ready to hop onboard

1208
01:16:51,874 --> 01:16:53,205
as soon as you guys
get it under 20.

1209
01:16:53,292 --> 01:16:54,953
Alright, tell them be
ready to hop, over.

1210
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:05,046
Shoot!

1211
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:15,135
What is it?
We're gaining speed.

1212
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:18,018
Consist is too heavy.
We're being dragged.

1213
01:17:27,326 --> 01:17:28,566
Connie!

1214
01:17:28,702 --> 01:17:29,942
I'm here, Frank.

1215
01:17:30,037 --> 01:17:31,777
We're gonna be coming
in too hot.

1216
01:17:33,165 --> 01:17:34,280
Let them know.

1217
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:35,956
The limit on that
curve is 15.

1218
01:17:36,043 --> 01:17:40,082
I don't know if you can take it
much faster, maybe 20, 25 max?

1219
01:17:40,172 --> 01:17:42,788
We may not have a choice. Just
tell them it's gonna be real hot.

1220
01:17:49,682 --> 01:17:51,013
What about the braking
on the freight cars?

1221
01:17:55,854 --> 01:17:56,889
Good, good.

1222
01:17:56,981 --> 01:17:57,936
Alright, I'm on it.

1223
01:17:58,023 --> 01:18:00,139
Just sit down. No, no.
I've got it. Sit tight.

1224
01:18:00,234 --> 01:18:02,850
I'll go out. Sit down.
No, in fact, come here.

1225
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:05,106
You sit here. I'll go out.

1226
01:18:05,197 --> 01:18:06,607
Just keep it at four.

1227
01:18:07,825 --> 01:18:09,190
- You alright? Take it easy.
- Yeah.

1228
01:18:09,326 --> 01:18:10,862
- Hold that dynamic at a four.
- Four.

1229
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:12,284
Integrate it with the
throttle if you have to.

1230
01:18:12,371 --> 01:18:14,282
Hold it at a four,
integrate the throttle.

1231
01:18:14,373 --> 01:18:16,455
Burn the block out,
it doesn't matter.

1232
01:18:17,209 --> 01:18:18,870
Hey, don't get
sentimental on me.

1233
01:18:19,378 --> 01:18:21,619
Makes me think I'm gonna die.
Just hold that four.

1234
01:18:42,067 --> 01:18:43,978
Come on Frank.

1235
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:46,105
AWVR officials have no comment.

1236
01:18:46,739 --> 01:18:50,197
Barnes is attempting to manually
brake the last car of 777.

1237
01:19:00,794 --> 01:19:03,831
He's actually running on top
of the grain cars and jumping...

1238
01:19:03,922 --> 01:19:05,662
Way to go, Frank.
Let's go, Frank.

1239
01:19:14,266 --> 01:19:16,598
<i>Looks like 777 is slowing down.</i>

1240
01:19:19,438 --> 01:19:21,520
<i>We understand
this is some sort of</i>

1241
01:19:21,607 --> 01:19:23,689
<i>an attempt to try
and stop the train.</i>

1242
01:19:23,776 --> 01:19:25,687
Yes! Come on.
Come on! You can do it!

1243
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,025
Will, how fast you going?

1244
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,280
34.

1245
01:19:38,749 --> 01:19:40,239
Alright, we're dropping 33.

1246
01:19:40,334 --> 01:19:43,292
The railroad spokesman
just confirmed he is...

1247
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:44,915
Think it'll work?
...attempting to slow 777

1248
01:19:45,005 --> 01:19:47,371
<i>by manually braking each car.</i>

1249
01:19:47,466 --> 01:19:48,876
Theoretically.

1250
01:19:48,967 --> 01:19:51,629
Provided that locomotive's
independent brake holds out.

1251
01:19:59,353 --> 01:20:02,220
We continue to bring you live
coverage of this breaking news event

1252
01:20:02,314 --> 01:20:03,394
from the town of Stanton.

1253
01:20:03,482 --> 01:20:06,189
<i>Emergency management officials
have created this perimeter.</i>

1254
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:13,234
<i>This is the police.
Get off the roof.</i>

1255
01:20:13,325 --> 01:20:15,657
<i>You are being asked to evacuate
for your own safety.</i>

1256
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:52,228
Shit!

1257
01:20:54,825 --> 01:20:55,905
Frank!

1258
01:20:56,243 --> 01:20:58,074
Yeah, I hear you.
I hear you!

1259
01:20:58,162 --> 01:20:59,698
We just lost our brakes!

1260
01:21:02,749 --> 01:21:04,114
Looks like the brakes
have blown.

1261
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:05,540
Shit!

1262
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,883
Frank!
Frank, you alright?

1263
01:21:18,515 --> 01:21:20,346
I'm here Will!
What happened?

1264
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:22,341
We're picking up speed again.

1265
01:21:24,897 --> 01:21:28,810
Can you still slow it down?
We're almost at the curve.

1266
01:21:28,901 --> 01:21:31,563
Frank, our engine
block's overheated.

1267
01:21:33,197 --> 01:21:34,607
I don't think those
hand brakes are gonna

1268
01:21:34,698 --> 01:21:36,029
have the muscle to stop
this thing.

1269
01:21:36,116 --> 01:21:37,356
We're creeping up fast.

1270
01:21:37,451 --> 01:21:39,863
Alright, well, just hang on
to the independent.

1271
01:21:40,746 --> 01:21:42,407
I'll tell you when.

1272
01:22:02,559 --> 01:22:07,019
Elevated and strictly Class 2, speed
restricted to 15 miles per hour.

1273
01:22:07,105 --> 01:22:08,970
Impact with at least
three of these buildings

1274
01:22:09,066 --> 01:22:10,772
directly below will
be unavoidable,

1275
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:14,272
as will contact with all the
fuel storage tanks situated here.

1276
01:22:15,072 --> 01:22:17,279
Will? Will.

1277
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:19,273
We're Alright.
we're Alright.

1278
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:20,949
but we're picking up
speed again.

1279
01:22:34,091 --> 01:22:35,171
Will!

1280
01:22:36,635 --> 01:22:39,627
We're coming into the curve!
Get ready!

1281
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:56,477
Will!
Hit that independent!

1282
01:22:57,364 --> 01:22:59,525
Hit that independent
as hard as you can!

1283
01:23:06,707 --> 01:23:08,163
Frank.
we're gonna rip right off.

1284
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:09,824
Got no choice.

1285
01:23:20,053 --> 01:23:21,839
Will!
Hang on!

1286
01:23:30,814 --> 01:23:33,021
Hit it! Hit it again!

1287
01:23:34,359 --> 01:23:35,439
Now!

1288
01:24:01,928 --> 01:24:03,338
Frank, you alright?

1289
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:06,217
We made it! We made it!
We're through the curve.

1290
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:11,677
<i>777 made it. It made it
through the Stanton curve.</i>

1291
01:24:11,772 --> 01:24:13,728
<i>777 is through the
Stanton curve,</i>

1292
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:15,897
<i>but by no means
out of trouble.</i>

1293
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:19,943
777 is gaining speed. It is out
of control and has to derail.

1294
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:22,395
<i>Frank Barnes and
Will Colson will be</i>

1295
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:24,322
<i>the victims of the
biggest rail disaster</i>

1296
01:24:24,409 --> 01:24:25,899
<i>in the history
of the northeast.</i>

1297
01:24:28,246 --> 01:24:31,409
<i>It looks like Frank Barnes
is making an all-out effort.</i>

1298
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,035
Good job.

1299
01:24:33,126 --> 01:24:36,744
<i>This is a remarkable effort
now to get to the front of 777.</i>

1300
01:24:42,761 --> 01:24:43,921
Frank!

1301
01:24:45,097 --> 01:24:48,180
We're at... We're at 60 and
we're going to hit 80 in no time!

1302
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:53,350
He's not gonna make it.

1303
01:24:54,815 --> 01:24:56,931
<i>Looks like the gap between
cars has stopped him.</i>

1304
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:58,231
You can do it!

1305
01:24:58,318 --> 01:25:02,231
<i>But the train continues to speed
in excess of 75 miles an hour.</i>

1306
01:25:02,614 --> 01:25:05,276
Frank! Frank!

1307
01:25:05,826 --> 01:25:07,817
Will, we got a problem here.

1308
01:25:10,414 --> 01:25:11,870
I don't think I can make it.

1309
01:25:14,459 --> 01:25:15,539
Oh God.

1310
01:25:24,553 --> 01:25:26,509
There's Ned!

1311
01:25:29,808 --> 01:25:32,174
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

1312
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:38,930
- Hello.
- Ned, it's Connie.

1313
01:25:39,025 --> 01:25:41,232
I'm kind of busy right now.
Connie, I'll call you back.

1314
01:26:00,881 --> 01:26:02,041

1315
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:08,293
Come on!

1316

Hop in the back of the truck!

1317
01:26:16,521 --> 01:26:18,933
Hop in the back of the truck!

1318
01:26:19,024 --> 01:26:22,141
Connie?
Connie, is that truck for us?

1319
01:26:22,778 --> 01:26:25,110
Yes it is, Will.
You can do this.

1320
01:26:25,197 --> 01:26:27,153
Will, you can do this!

1321
01:26:33,038 --> 01:26:34,244
Come on!

1322
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:49,338

with the train.</i>

1324
01:26:52,933 --> 01:26:56,300
Do it, you pussy!
Jump in the back!

1325
01:27:01,233 --> 01:27:02,973
Yes! Yes!

1326
01:27:03,068 --> 01:27:04,604
Yeah!

1327
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:08,068
Yeah!

1328
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,411
<i>And look at what's
happening now.</i>

1329
01:27:16,498 --> 01:27:18,534
<i>The red pickup racing
to the front of 777.</i>

It's all about precision.
Good job, kid.

Your foot's hurt. He cut his
foot! I think it's broken.

Ned, were you worried?

Was I worried?
Nah, not really.

1365

It's all about precision. I wouldn't
have undertaken such a task...

What was your first reaction when
you realized what was happening?

I felt I was in
my comfort zone.

What'd they say
about your job?

They said it's mine
if I want to keep it.

1376
01:31:57,529 --> 01:31:58,739
They'd be stupid not
to give it to you.

1377
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:01,367
Yeah, that's what I told them.

1378
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:06,151
Said they better think about
giving me a better one too.

1379

- How about me?
- How about you?

1380

As you can see, the result
was a positive. Ned...

1381

Do we have any better of an
idea as to how this happened?
