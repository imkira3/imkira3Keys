It's a stolen van.

They found it ditched in
Brisco Canyon about an hour ago.

All right, that's
pretty rugged terrain.

They can't have gotten
too far if they're on foot.

398
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,962
Set up checkpoints
at a 20-mile radius

and search every inch all
the way down to the ocean.

she was at that night-club?

Said someone called from the

Barbara's listed
as a blood donor.

No. The guy
hung up on her.

Get a hold of the phone records
and see if you can trace that call.

Everyone in Gotham

I thought
your wife was dead.

She will be dead
if you don't help her.

That's what this is
about, isn't it?

It's about her.

455
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,723

that requires a transfusion.

You're one of the few people
with her rare blood type.

Uh-huh.
So why here?

458
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,570
She should be
in a hospital.

No hospitals
and no more questions.

let her die, would you?

might be able to help.

Are you kidding? One of our
major investors? What do you need?

482
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,477
How much do you know about the
medical aspects of cryogenics?

Well, it's not exactly
my specialty,

484
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,402
but I have done some reading
on it. What do you want to know?

485
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,823
Under what conditions would a person
who's been cryogenically frozen

486
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,445
need a blood
transfusion?

487

As far as I know,
never.

That's the point
of the procedure.

You really ought to talk to someone
who's more of an expert, though.

Who's the foremost authority
on the subject around here?

Oh, that's easy.
Dr Gregory Belson.

492
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,543
He did a lot of the original
research on the subject

00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:22,794
with Victor Fries.

the party the other night.

503
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,236
Right.

So what does Freeze want
with the doctor?

chain me up, you creep.

Try to escape again, I'll
chain your feet as well.

509
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,170
How can you treat people
this way?

510
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,627
It's the way they've always treated me.

511
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,052
Nora was the only
good thing in my life.

512
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,015
Then they took her from me.

I don't care what I have
to do to get her back.

Did Freeze
kidnap you, too?

No.
And I'm not just a kid.

Oh, I'm sorry.

But Mr. Freeze
takes care of me now.

You got to be kidding.

You don't like him,
do you?

to like someone

He leveraged futures
with everything he had.

Then some side effects
were discovered,

572
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,589
and the FDA put everything
on hold.

660
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,080
Robin: Someone's there, all right.

661
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,161
Wait a minute.

662
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,659
I see something.

663
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:02,790
There's Barbara!

664
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,205
Hurry!

665
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,380
Hang on.

666
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,284
Stop shooting,
you idiot.

667
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:39,740
These are
fuel tanks.

668
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,666
Come down now!

669
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:31,879
Up here.

670
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:33,964
Are you all right?

671
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,766
[Gasps]

672
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,556
It's OK.
I got him.

673
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:01,972
Wait.

674
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:03,925
Wait.

675
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:05,802
Now!

676
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:29,535
Help!

677
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,163
Batman: Over there!

678
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,465
Shoot me a line!

679
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,052
Stand back!

680
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,556
Hurry!

681
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,143
You!

682
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:56,486
Look out!

683
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,174
Aah!

684
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,758
Barbara!

685
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:29,685
Aah!

686
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,407
We got to get out of here!

687
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,071
I'm working on it.

688
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,338
She's behind the generators. Over there.

689
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,588
You go that way.

690
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,007
Are you crazy?
There's no way now.

691
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,971
We're going
to finish this.

692
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:08,763
You're insane. The whole place
is going to blow any minute.

693
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,218
We got to get out!

694
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,769
We're not leaving until
you perform that operation.

695
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,651
Look out!

696
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,829
Gregory...

697
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,505
help me.

698
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,264
Brace yourself.

699
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,450
My leg is broken.

700
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,635
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

701
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:35,516
No.
Not without Nora.

702
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,142
Where is she?

703
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,644
Down below.
There's a boy there, too.

704
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,192
Come on! This way!

705
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,068
Aah!

706
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,442
There's no way.

707
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:47,945
Stand back!

708
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:58,914
Hurry!

709
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:02,918
You stay here.

710
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,965
You need me to show you where they are.

711
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,088
She's right.

712
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,885
Robin,
get the Batwing ready.

713
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,053
If this place starts to
blow, get out of here.

714
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,506
I won't leave
without you.

715
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:12,431
Go!

716
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,259
We're running
out of time.

717
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,024
This way.

718
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,479
No!

719
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,339
[Coughing]

720
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,880
Come on, big guy.
I've got you.

721
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,476
[Explosion]

722
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,605
Freeze!

723
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,614
Is there another way out?

724
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,865
The elevator.

725
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,054
Oh, no.

726
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:43,829
Let's go.

727
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,622
Take them first.

728
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,958
You can come back
for me.

729
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,580
Let's go. Let's go!

730
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,008
If I'm not back in time,
go without me.

731
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,881
What? Wait!

732
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,696
[Gasping]

733
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,740
Hold on.

734
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,123
Aah!

735
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,463
Freeze!

736
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:15,041
Aah!

737
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:05,864
News announcer: Today's top 2
stories come from Gotham City

738
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,826
where local newscaster
Summer Gleason is standing by.

739
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,073
Summer Gleason: In a case
that could herald a new era

740
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,579
in cryogenic medicine,

741
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,537
Nora Fries has been revived
from her frozen state

742
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,372
and has undergone
a vital organ transplant.

743
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:21,756
Nora Fries is the wife
of the late Victor Fries

744
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,344
who was killed 2 weeks ago

745
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,968
when an offshore
drilling platform exploded

746
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,845
and collapsed
into the ocean.

747
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:31,723
The transplant operation, funded
by the Waynetech Corporation

748
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,064
under the auspices of
its CEO, Mr. Bruce Wayne,

749
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,938
was today declared
a resounding success

750
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,982
by Dr. Lyle Johnston,

751
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,564
chief surgeon
at Gotham General Hospital.

752
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:46,446
Mrs. Fries is reported to be
resting in stable condition.

753
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,237
Ironically,
the cryogenic technology

754
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,072
invented by Nora's husband,

755
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,827
which tragically
transformed him

756
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,871
into the criminal
Mr. Freeze,

757
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:58,329
was credited by Dr. Johnston
as having saved her life.

758
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:01,591
It's a shame
Victor Fries will never know.

759
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,417
In other news,

760
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:06,170
Gotham's mysterious defender,
the Batman,

761
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,048
was seen last night helping
police apprehend the leaders

762
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,884
of an underworld
gun-running operation.

763
01:02:12,305 --> 01:03:12,830
