You're all dismissed. Eh?

335
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:31,721
All of ya, dismissed.

336
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:35,433
You'll never sail with Captain
Jack Sparrow again, tell you that.

337
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,150
SCARFIELD: The whole town speaks of you.

338
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:27,444
The only survivor of the <i>Monarch.</i>

339
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:31,990
A boy who paddled all the way to Saint Martin
against the tide on a piece of driftwood.

340
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:36,745
Found jabbering about pirates and tridents.

341
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,247
Please, sir, let me go of these chains.

342
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:42,834
My job is to protect
this island and these waters.

343
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:45,587
And your sleeves have been ripped.

344
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,340
The mark of treason.

345
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:49,758
We were attacked by the dead...

346
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,927
You're a coward who ran from battle.

347
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:54,471
And that is how you'll die.

348
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,026
I don't believe you're a coward.

349
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,611
Please leave me, sister.

350
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:13,782
I've risked my life to come here,
to see if the rumours are true.

351
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,450
You speak of the Trident?

352
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,452
Who are you?

353
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,829
Tell me why you seek the Trident.

354
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,959
The Trident can break any curse at sea.

355
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,295
My father is trapped by such a curse.

356
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,798
You're aware that curses
are not supported by science.

357
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,049
Neither are ghosts.

358
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,135
So you have gone mad?
I should never have come here.

359
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,804
Then why did you come here?

360
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,014
Because I need to get off this island.

361
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,558
- To solve <i>The Map No Man...
- No Man Can Read.</i>

362
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,811
Left by Poseidon himself.

363
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,523
You've read the ancient text?

364
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,192
In each language they were written.

365
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:54,030
But this map has never been
seen nor read by any man.

366
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,825
Luckily, I'm a woman.

367
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:02,872
This is the diary of Galileo Galilei.

368
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,583
He spent his life searching for the Trident.

369
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,419
It's why he invented the spyglass...

370
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:10,171
why astronomers have spent
their lives staring into the sky.

371
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:15,427
So you're saying <i>The Map No Man
Can Read</i> is hidden in the stars?

372
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,512
It was left to me by my father.

373
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,974
He believed I could find
what no man has ever found

374
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,059
and I will not let him down.

375
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:25,854
Soon there will be a blood moon.

376
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,273
Only then can the map be read.

377
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,358
And the Trident found.

379
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,362
Carina Smyth.

380
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:36,865
CARINA: If you wish to save
your father, you'll have to save me.

381
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,034
Find us a ship and the Trident will be ours.

(SWORD SWISHES)

01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:19,346
Not yet, <i>Capitán</i>. There!

985
01:08:19,555 --> 01:08:21,557
Found as promised.

986
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:49,001
So she's saying she's got the map,
but she's the only one who can follow it?

987
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:50,544
So we should shoot her?

988
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:52,838
Leave her be. She will
take us to the Trident.

989
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:54,215
You've been saying that for hours.

990
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:56,008
Two things we know are true, eh?

991
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:57,635
- Yeah.
- Stars don't shine by day.

992
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,470
And she forgot the donkey.

993
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:04,475
How can we go to a spot where
no land exists on any map?

994
01:09:05,643 --> 01:09:08,354
This chronometer keeps
the exact time in London.

995
01:09:08,813 --> 01:09:12,316
I'm using it to make an altitude
measurement to determine longitude.

996
01:09:12,483 --> 01:09:15,027
Only then will we find our exact spot at sea.

997
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:17,738
So you expect to find
the Trident with a timepiece?

998
01:09:17,905 --> 01:09:19,114
Yes.

999

Oh, yeah.

No. No, I'm a horologist.

1006
01:09:39,677 --> 01:09:41,011
So was my mum.

1007
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:42,721
But she didn't crow about it as loud as you.

1008
01:09:42,972 --> 01:09:45,182
Are you saying your mother
was academically inclined?

More like, horizontally reclined.

1010
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:52,940
Horology is the study of time.

1011
01:09:53,107 --> 01:09:55,359
And she was always looking at her watch.

1012
01:09:55,526 --> 01:09:56,902
I can vouch for that.

1013
01:09:58,571 --> 01:10:02,408
So no one can find the "X" but you, right?

Dead?

1019
01:10:17,131 --> 01:10:19,049
No, no. The dead were never
part of this deal.

1020
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:22,177
We should have never followed
a luckless pirate and a witch to sea.

1021
01:10:22,803 --> 01:10:24,597
Right, that's it. Kill 'em all.

1022
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:28,893
Kill me and I'll be dead.

1023
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:32,938
And then the other dead won't be
able to have their revenge...

1024
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:34,732
against me.

So I'm going to swim for it.

- No, no, no. Don't stop that.

No, it has not.

Apology? Why would I apologise?

1302
01:27:17,108 --> 01:27:19,569
Because we've been chased by the dead,
sailing on a ship raised from a bottle.

that you owe me an apology...

as my life has been threatened
by pirates and dead men.

Stolen from an Italian ship many years ago.

1318

Stolen? No, you're mistaken.

1319
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:23,007
There was a ruby on the cover
I would not soon forget.

1320
01:28:25,718 --> 01:28:27,345
This was given to me by my father...

1321
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:29,681
who was clearly a man of science.

Left to me on the steps of a children's home.

It's right on the tip of me tongue. Oh!

Should we make an accord then?

1348

Or shall I tell you-know-who
what we both know to be true?

We both take this secret to our graves.

I'm not.

You kill me, you got nothing
to bargain the dead with.

1353
01:30:37,016 --> 01:30:39,310
So you need me.

1354
01:30:40,061 --> 01:30:42,146
I'll have to be frank, Hector.

1355

You are very, very ugly.

1356
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:49,403
So how could you produce
a fetching creature such as that?

1357
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:51,239
Margaret died.

1358
01:30:51,405 --> 01:30:54,742
I summoned as much honour
as a worthless blaggard ever could.

1359
01:30:54,909 --> 01:30:56,828
I placed the infant in an orphanage...

1360
01:30:56,994 --> 01:30:58,371
never to see her again.

1361
01:30:58,538 --> 01:31:01,499
I thought the ruby might afford her
some ease in life...

1362
01:31:01,666 --> 01:31:04,460
but I never imagined
she'd take those scribblings...

1363
01:31:04,627 --> 01:31:06,170
and make a life of her own.

1364

A life that's led her back to me.

1365
01:31:12,009 --> 01:31:13,678
