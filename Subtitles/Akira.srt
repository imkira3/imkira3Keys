1
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:16,726
Akira - Anime 1988 English

2
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,729
Groups of unemployed workers,
who have grown in number...

3
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:08,483
due to tax reforms enacted by the former Prime
Minister, are rioting all across the country.

4
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:10,963
There is confusion among parliament members
which was sparked by the comments...

5
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:14,364
of Finance Minister Takanashi
during the recent parliament inquiry.

6
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,511
There seems to be no compromise in sight
between the government and opposition.

7
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:19,638
Hey, there. Call it.

8
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:22,080
- Hey, there. Call it.
- Gimme something'. Three peanuts.

9
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:24,833
Let's see...

10
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:27,252
Now, uh...

11
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:42,267
The Clown bastards are herded
out on route number 5.

12
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:47,939
Damn it, don't scare me like that.
Open that damn door quietly.

13
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:51,193
You know, you wouldn't be so jumpy
if you didn't have anything to hide.

14
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:55,621
Why don't you sell
normal drinks for a change?

15
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,534
How about buying' something' for once?
This ain't a hangout for damn street gangs.

16
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,453
Yeah, right!
Drink your dog piss?

17
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,794
Twin ceramic rotor drives
on each wheel.

18
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:11,087
Let's see. And these are...

19
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:15,425
computer-controlled
anti lock brakes.

20
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:18,136
Huh, 200 horses at 12,000 R.P.M.

21
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:23,475
You want to ride it, Tetsuo?

22
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:24,810
All right! Let's hit it!

23
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,066
I customized that bike for myself.
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.

24
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:35,320
I don't see how you could ride
something crazy like that, man.

25
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:38,114
Huh! I could.

26
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:41,326
Ha! If you want it so bad
then steal one yourself.

27
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:48,829
Unbelievable.

28
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:49,853
- Unbelievable.
- Punks!

29
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,232
Hey, waiter!
Where are you going?

30
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:00,739
They ran into the alley!
After 'em!

31
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:16,755
Quit fooling' around, you idiot!

32
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:21,217
Fuck!

33
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:55,210
What?

34
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:26,426
That's the...

35
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,075
- That's the...
- Huh?

36
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,994
This is unit 375.

37
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,165
We've got reports of biker gangs fighting
near the intersection of highway 14 South.

38
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,085
Request immediate assistance.
Car 375 en route to the scene...

39
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:40,255
It's the cops.
What should we do?

40
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:43,299
Damn it. My motor coils were
just getting warmed up.

41
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:52,684
Bastards!
Let's go, Tetsuo!

42
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,102
I'm coming!

43
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:55,080
Damn them!

44
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:56,104
- Damn them!
- Come on!

45
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:08,450
A skirmish has broken out between student
protesters and riot police.

46
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:11,536
There appear to be some
casualties. Next...

47
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:35,143
Don't make me get out of this car!

48
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:37,353
Jerk, I'm in a hurry!

49
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:54,514
What was that?

50
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:55,914
- What was that?
- Police is here!!

51
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:25,527
This area is off limits!

52
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:28,113
Go back! It's dangerous!

53
00:08:28,197 --> 00:08:29,517
Hey, something strange
over there.

54
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:31,116
Let me through!
Sorry.

55
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:32,242
What're you doing?

56
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,544
It's blood. Look!

57
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:46,256
Please let me through.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

58
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:48,049
Watch it, jerk!

59
00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:53,805
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

60
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:55,348
Ryu!

61
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:58,184
Hey, look!
They're running away!

62
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:04,649
He's got a gun!

63
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:12,490
Fire!

64
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:15,994
Wait! He's got a kid!

65
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:27,589
Run.

66
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:30,633
You gotta hurry.

67
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:36,848
Go to Ryu.

68
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:39,851
Ryu will help you now.

69
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:45,857
Get out of here... Now!

70
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:20,308
Kei!

71
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,562
We've gotta get out of here, Kei?

72
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:29,567
He's gone!

73
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:39,994
He's to the West.

74
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,998
West?
The old city...

75
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:56,427
Eat this!

76
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:10,733
Tetsuo!

77
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:52,483
Ryu! Where are you?

78
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:57,196
Kei!

79
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:25,600
No, that's...

80
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:47,372
How do you like that?

81
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:59,550
Well? Who is it?

82
00:12:59,676 --> 00:13:02,053
It's not him.
It's not Tetsuo.

83
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,055
All right. Move out!

84
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:13,898
Why you... What'd you do,
you weird little...

85
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:29,664
Tetsuo! Just hang on!

86
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:33,376
What? What did you say?

87
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:35,711
That kid...

88
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:40,675
He's really hurt bad.

89
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:43,428
Hey! You, there!

90
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,682
We gotta get him to a hospital!
He needs an ambulance!

91
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:49,684
We can't move him!

92
00:13:58,318 --> 00:14:00,611
Wha... What the...!

93
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:17,753
There's no escape.

94
00:14:23,177 --> 00:14:25,303
We're here to take you
back with us.

95
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:34,312
You know we can't survive outside.

96
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:35,980
Well, come along.

97
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:42,153
Army helicopters!
It's the army!

98
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:50,328
Move out!

99
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:02,924
Kiss the ground!
Hands on your heads!

100
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,260
We're, uh, innocent bystanders,
that's all.

101
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:08,679
Kiss the ground!
Hands on your heads!

102
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:20,191
That hurts, damn it.

103
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:21,317
Kai!

104
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:28,301
Soldier.

105
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:29,135
Sir.

106
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,493
- Sir.
- Who are those kids?

107
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:32,995
They seem to be
an ordinary biker gang, sir.

108
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:50,805
We're returning.

109
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:52,992
Ouch! Will you just hold on a minute?

110
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:55,411
- Ouch! Will you just hold on a minute?
- My arms don't bend that way!

111
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:58,229
Pull the wounded
onto the helicopter.

112
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:02,149
Tetsuo! Hey, wait! You can't
take him away like that!

113
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:03,317
Kaneda!

114
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:06,654
What the hell are you guys doing?
We didn't do anything!

115
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,155
Get off!

116
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:12,803
All right. The story is, you and your
friends went out at night...

117
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:15,222
on your bikes to visit
your dying mother, and then...

118
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:19,143
another bunch of biker hooligans
called the Clowns attacked you.

119
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:22,707
They hurt your friend, you lost your temper,
and that's why eight of these Clowns...

120
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:26,317
your attackers... are all now in
the hospital, and that is the truth.

121
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:28,611
Wow! She sure is hot.

122
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:31,405
Hmm? This is confidential!

123
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:33,115
And how's your mother doing?

124
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:37,328
Fortunately, the worst is over.
She cleared the hump.

125
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:40,581
She cleared the hump,
and you left her for cruising, huh?

126
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:41,832
Wha...?

127
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:48,422
Ah, these bozos couldn't
have anything to do with it.

128
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:50,424
That goes without saying.

129
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,179
Wait out on that bench.
Do you understand?

130
00:17:57,808 --> 00:18:00,267
All right.
Send in the next five.

131
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:04,271
So the army's working
with the police...

132
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:07,358
to hunt down anti government
groups, or so it seems.

133
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,967
You wanna put up a fight?

134
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:17,031
- You wanna put up a fight?
- Get your hands off me!

135
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,543
Long live
the freedom revolution!

136
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:30,297
He's got a grenade!

137
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:48,566
All right, that's enough.
Get him back in there.

138
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:51,068
I'll teach him a lesson.
He won't forget.

139
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:54,572
You dumb bastard!
If you wanna die, hang yourself!

140
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:59,076
Listen, you kids are free to leave.
We've contacted your schools.

141
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:02,413
Hold on a second, old man!

142
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,166
Wha... "Old man"?

143
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:06,932
There was someone else with us, you know.

144
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:08,252
What was that?

145
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:11,046
Excuse me, please?

146
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:13,883
Huh? Hey!
What are you doing?

147
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:16,886
Uh, it's this one right here.
Can't leave my friend.

148
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:19,513
Don't ever call me "old man,"
you little punk!

149
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:21,265
That's my foot!

150
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:26,103
You listen here, kid. I'm only 25
years old. I'm not even married yet.

151
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:30,441
Watch your mouth. Get out of
here and take your friend with you.

152
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:31,377
I'm starving!

153
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,110
- I'm starving!
- I need a doctor!

154
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:38,407
I think the army was chasing that weird kid
Kaneda saw. That's what I think.

155
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:41,076
Yeah, you're right.
I think I saw him too.

156
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:44,955
Speaking of Tetsuo, why the hell wouldn't
they tell us what hospital they threw him in?

157
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:46,415
Huh? What was that?

158
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:50,211
What I meant was
maybe we could go for a drink.

159
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:53,547
I figure we could have a nice,
long chat about something you're into...

160
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:55,800
like the whole revolution thing.

161
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:59,470
I think you're a skirt chaser
who'll try anything he can.

162
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:02,807
You'll help anyone so long as
it's a girl. Right?

163
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:03,974
You're wrong!

164
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,744
I have very high standards.

165
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:07,728
- I have very high standards.
- Line 'em up! Come on! Move it!

166
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:10,294
It's not their looks that count.
It's their... I don't know...

167
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:12,983
A girl's sensitivity
that makes me do it.

168
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:16,987
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh...

169
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:18,591
I'm Kaneda. It's nice to... Huh?

170
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:20,593
- I'm Kaneda. It's nice to... Huh?
- See you around, Kaneda.

171
00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:24,286
Wait a second!
You're leaving just like that?

172
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:28,666
Hey! Now hold on. I'm the guy
that saved you back there.

173
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:35,589
You could at least tell me
your name, you cold bitch!

174
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:42,012
Yes, I'll try talking with him,
but it's risky business.

175
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:46,016
If they think you're avoiding responsibility,
the whole thing could blow up in your face.

176
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:50,771
I can't believe that there's
a mole in the executive council.

177
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,690
Even if there is a mole...

178
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:55,192
That's not what's important here!

179
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:59,530
What is are political manoeuvrers and
diplomacy which, apparently, you despise.

180
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:02,032
I never studied the two subjects
in school, it would seem.

181
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:05,035
In any case, at the next
executive council meeting...

182
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:07,788
your poor management and lack of
judgment on this last incident...

183
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:10,207
will be called into question.

184
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:15,546
There's a call for the colonel, sir.

185
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,051
Put your affairs in order,
if you want my advice.

186
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:25,890
Yes, it's me. What is it now?

187
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:49,371
This way, please, Colonel.

188
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:54,543
I'm terribly sorry to call you here,
but there's something you really must see.

189
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:00,257
Colonel, please look at this.

190
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:03,218
It's the special pattern
I'm getting from that young man.

191
00:22:03,345 --> 00:22:05,763
It doesn't resemble any
that I've seen so far...

192
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:09,016
and I've never seen a developmental speed
or configuration like this.

193
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:13,520
It may have begun with the shock of
contact with number 26, or it could be...

194
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:16,607
Have you finished running the comparison
against Akira's pattern?

195
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:19,193
I'll show you right now.

196
00:22:22,822 --> 00:22:26,450
This projection is made using mixed data,
and the results are not quite correct...

197
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:29,119
so a direct comparison is difficult.

198
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:32,706
But I believe based on what we see
here that this boy's pattern is the key...

199
00:22:32,832 --> 00:22:36,085
to solving the riddle of
Akira's growth-pattern process.

200
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:37,813
Fine. You may continue.

201
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:39,565
- Fine. You may continue.
- Thank you very much, sir.

202
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:42,967
I'm certain he'll turn out to be a worthy
addition to the numbers, don't you?

203
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:45,970
It may be rough on the boy...

204
00:22:46,096 --> 00:22:49,556
but I thought we might try starting
him off with level 7 capsules.

205
00:22:49,683 --> 00:22:51,141
Is it safe, doctor?

206
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:52,476
I will take care of it.

207
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:56,981
No! I wasn't talking
about the boy at all!

208
00:22:57,107 --> 00:23:00,109
If he turns out
to reach a power like Akira's...

209
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:02,820
are you positive that you are
able to control such power?

210
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,613
Uh, well, that's a...

211
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:07,491
Can you handle this?

212
00:23:07,617 --> 00:23:09,994
Uh, well, then, in my opinion...

213
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,747
if we can use the latest examination
equipment to collect even more data...

214
00:23:13,873 --> 00:23:17,334
and also do a multifaceted
analysis as we go, then surely...

215
00:23:18,753 --> 00:23:22,840
But maybe we weren't meant to
meddle with that ultimate power.

216
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:26,260
You mean...
the power of a god?

217
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:31,640
"A-ki-ra."

218
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:34,143
But we have no choice
but to grasp that power...

219
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,646
grasp that power
and learn to control it.

220
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:40,858
And if this situation gets out
of hand, then he's to be terminated.

221
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:43,754
And without hesitation!

222
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:45,378
- And without hesitation!
- Yes, Colonel.

223
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:48,782
This school is your last chance!

224
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,595
If trash like you guys can't keep up with
the academic ability of regular students...

225
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:55,497
If you can't live a decent
social life, you end up here!

226
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:57,833
And if you screw up here,
it's the end of the road!

227
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:01,545
Also, even though you're under 15,
if you get more than 50 penalty points...

228
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:03,797
you're sent to the
regular court.

229
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,050
Aw, bite me. Don't mess
with us, you bald old goat.

230
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:08,052
Are you listening?

231
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:09,321
You lost me halfway through.

232
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:10,781
- You lost me halfway through.
- Discipline!

233
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:15,809
Discipline! Discipline!

234
00:24:15,935 --> 00:24:17,895
Discipline! Dismissed!

235
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:22,691
Thank you very much, sir.

236
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:26,839
You loser! I'm gonna beat you up someday!

237
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:28,174
- You loser! I'm gonna beat you up someday!
- We're gonna remember this!

238
00:24:28,198 --> 00:24:29,341
Yeah, you sick mother!

239
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:32,076
- Yeah, you sick mother!
- Damn!

240
00:24:37,707 --> 00:24:38,999
Hi, Yamagata!

241
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,502
What happened to your cheek?

242
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:42,521
Don't bother me.

243
00:24:42,545 --> 00:24:44,505
- Don't bother me.
- I heard you got into a fight.

244
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:47,674
My friends told me you fought
the Clowns on the highway in the old city.

245
00:24:47,717 --> 00:24:48,425
Big deal.

246
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:51,261
Why didn't you wipe 'em out?
Those guys are so gross.

247
00:24:51,387 --> 00:24:54,598
Clowns, demonstrators,
cops, the damn army...

248
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:56,767
and that idiot Tetsuo
had an accident!

249
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:58,602
What happened to Tetsuo?

250
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:00,486
He's in the hospital,
but we don't know where.

251
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:02,523
Dumb loser was trying
to show off.

252
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:03,774
Yeah, a real jerk.

253
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,277
Stupid idiot!

254
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:09,215
You're talking about Tetsuo, right?

255
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:10,633
- You're talking about Tetsuo, right?
- Shut up already!

256
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:12,468
Why do you have to be hanging'
on my arm every minute?

257
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:13,951
What the heck has got into you?

258
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:32,970
Tetsuo, it's time
for your medicines.

259
00:25:34,264 --> 00:25:36,640
Doctor, hurry!
The boy is gone!

260
00:25:40,603 --> 00:25:45,482
No, I can't. You know the dorm mother always
throws a fit if you go out before 10:00.

261
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:50,487
Yeah, you know, the one with a face
like a goat? That woman is such a pain.

262
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:53,615
She's always complaining about us girls.
Huh? Tomorrow at 3:00?

263
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:59,121
Yeah, that's cool. Hey, what
happened to that girl? You know who.

264
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:03,125
I don't like her at all.
She gets on my nerves.

265
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:04,251
Kaori!

266
00:26:06,254 --> 00:26:07,838
Tetsuo!

267
00:26:07,964 --> 00:26:12,593
Everyone's been worried about you.
They thought you were dead.

268
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:23,520
When I woke up, I was on an
operating table or something.

269
00:26:23,646 --> 00:26:26,356
That examination... Ohh!

270
00:26:26,482 --> 00:26:29,526
It's like they were messing
around inside my head.

271
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:34,031
No, I don't want to go back
there again. We'll run away.

272
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:36,200
Where would we go to?

273
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:42,372
I don't know. Some place.
Some place far away.

274
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,796
Self study today!

275
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,381
Where'd the teacher go to?

276
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:55,219
What about my burning desire
to study and learn a vocation?

277
00:26:55,345 --> 00:26:56,720
Drag his butt in here!

278
00:26:57,972 --> 00:27:00,117
Kaneda! Hurry! Your bike!

279
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:02,061
- Kaneda! Hurry! Your bike!
- What about my bike?

280
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:04,061
See? Look down there!

281
00:27:06,147 --> 00:27:08,398
Wha... Tetsuo?

282
00:27:11,152 --> 00:27:12,504
Is this okay?

283
00:27:12,528 --> 00:27:15,072
- Is this okay?
- Aw, quiet! Shut up and hang on!

284
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:27,102
Huh? What the...

285
00:27:27,126 --> 00:27:29,086
- Huh? What the...
- What's wrong?

286
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:30,814
Uuh! Aw, Shit!

287
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:31,922
- Uuh! Aw, Shit!
- Ooh!

288
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:35,425
Oops, it's... stopping...
stopped...

289
00:27:36,552 --> 00:27:40,931
I get it. The engine can't drop below 5,000
R.P.M.S even when you're changing the gears.

290
00:27:41,015 --> 00:27:41,951
Ouch, my butt hurts.

291
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:43,035
- Ouch, my butt hurts.
- I understand now.

292
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:44,685
Look, some bikes.

293
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:50,107
Is that Kaneda and...
Wha... No, it isn't!

294
00:27:51,818 --> 00:27:54,778
Oh, shit! Kaori!

295
00:27:58,574 --> 00:27:59,574
Any sign of 'em?

296
00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:02,154
Kuwata and the others went
to go look around Kisarazu.

297
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:05,580
The only place we haven't
searched now is the industrial area.

298
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:07,124
Okay! Let's go!

299
00:28:09,877 --> 00:28:12,963
We owe you from the other night.
Now it's time for payback.

300
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:20,220
Whoo-hoo!

301
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:22,597
Shut up!

302
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:27,811
Kaori! What happened?

303
00:28:34,777 --> 00:28:35,652
No, don't!

304
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:39,990
If you put a single scratch on that bike,
I'm gonna kill you asshole!

305
00:28:42,744 --> 00:28:43,744
Huh?

306
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:46,997
Run!

307
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:49,082
After them!

308
00:28:54,922 --> 00:28:56,465
No, wait.

309
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:08,685
Tetsuo!

310
00:29:24,827 --> 00:29:27,287
You're gonna kill him, Tetsuo!
You want that?

311
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:30,290
I want him more than dead!
I'll split his frigging' head open!

312
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:32,125
Just knock it off now!

313
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:36,838
This whole thing happened because you
took my bike for a spin. Enough already.

314
00:29:36,964 --> 00:29:40,008
Shut up! Don't order me around!

315
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:42,135
We were just worried.

316
00:29:42,261 --> 00:29:44,971
Why do you always
have to try to save me?

317
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:48,392
I could handle it on my own.

318
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:54,481
I admit that I've gotten beaten before,
but I won't always be on the receiving end.

319
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:56,566
Do you understand?

320
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:01,947
Tetsuo...

321
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:05,700
Shut up! Go away!

322
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,080
Hey, wait! Where're you going?

323
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:12,791
Leave me alone!

324
00:30:15,628 --> 00:30:17,379
"Akira!"

325
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:21,925
Tetsuo!

326
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:26,388
Something wrong?

327
00:30:27,306 --> 00:30:28,014
"Akira!"

328
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:30,434
I don't know who that is!

329
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,958
Tetsuo... What's wrong?

330
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:05,135
This is really strange. I'm getting
a blue pattern on scope number 3.

331
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:08,638
What? No! Retrieve the
subject now! Hurry!

332
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,988
Why don't you guys
just leave my friend alone?

333
00:31:28,284 --> 00:31:32,913
What's with the getup, huh?
You going' to a funeral?

334
00:31:39,086 --> 00:31:40,170
Tetsuo!

335
00:31:40,922 --> 00:31:41,922
Kaneda!

336
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,674
Screw you!

337
00:31:54,143 --> 00:31:55,977
No, wait!

338
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:03,944
Kaneda, what the hell's
going' on?

339
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:17,541
Well, well. I see we have
some real hip youngsters...

340
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:21,044
doing' their thing in spite of the tight
checkpoints they got going around tonight.

341
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,548
And that just means that they're
all pretty stupid, doesn't it?

342
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:29,344
This is boring.

343
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,846
Hey, what do you say?
Let's go home.

344
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:34,349
What?
But it's still early.

345
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:38,353
Yeah, but without their bikes,
they're just tail chasers outta water.

346
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:39,813
You mean "fish".

347
00:32:39,855 --> 00:32:42,524
Come on.
Let's go and toss these fish back.

348
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:46,361
Hey, Kaneda.
What are we gonna do?

349
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,259
What the heck?

350
00:32:50,283 --> 00:32:51,366
- What the heck?
- Look.

351
00:33:17,977 --> 00:33:19,185
That's...

352
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:22,772
Here we go again. Look, let's get out
of here before we get caught up in it.

353
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:26,461
Huh? Kaneda?

354
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:27,777
- Huh? Kaneda?
- Hey!

355
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:33,241
This area is being cordoned off
due to a terrorist bombing.

356
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,702
Those who wish to get through,
line up in single file...

357
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:38,705
present your I.D. and proceed
through the checkpoint.

358
00:33:49,508 --> 00:33:51,968
Get in.
What's wrong? Hurry.

359
00:33:52,094 --> 00:33:54,220
I'll meet you shortly.

360
00:33:54,347 --> 00:33:56,473
You know the rendezvous point, right?

361
00:33:58,225 --> 00:33:58,577
Be careful.

362
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:01,478
- Be careful.
- You too. You be careful.

363
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,493
Hey! Hold it right there!

364
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:20,288
She's got a gun!

365
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:35,178
Okay, that's far enough!
All right, drop it!

366
00:34:43,104 --> 00:34:44,104
Drop it!

367
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:51,361
Don't do it!

368
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,312
I think it came from over here.

369
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:08,211
- I think it came from over here.
- There were two shots.

370
00:35:08,337 --> 00:35:10,046
No, three.
It's just up ahead!

371
00:35:11,298 --> 00:35:15,051
Hey! Let's get out of here.
Come on!

372
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:22,452
Kaneda!

373
00:36:48,437 --> 00:36:52,148
There. Now what's the matter?
Talk about it.

374
00:36:52,274 --> 00:36:55,151
It was a dream that I saw.

375
00:36:55,277 --> 00:36:57,153
A dream?

376
00:36:58,614 --> 00:37:03,660
The city started to crumble apart,
covered by a big shadow.

377
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:07,580
Lots of people died.
And the three of us...

378
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:09,958
we get to meet Akira again.

379
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:11,668
Wha... Akira?

380
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:14,754
The city will crumble...

381
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,466
So many people...
So many will die.

382
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:23,179
When will it happen?
Do you know when? Kiyoko!

383
00:37:23,305 --> 00:37:26,266
You mustn't let that boy go.

384
00:37:26,475 --> 00:37:28,685
His power, it...

385
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:36,795
What's she talking about?

386
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:38,547
- What's she talking about?
- Well, there's, uh...

387
00:37:38,571 --> 00:37:43,032
There seems to be nothing
physically wrong with her.

388
00:37:43,158 --> 00:37:46,619
Her medication looks accurate.
There's no sign of any abnormalities...

389
00:37:46,745 --> 00:37:49,038
in her EKG or her EEG either.

390
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:55,003
I think number 25's statement is probably
her precognitive power at work.

391
00:37:55,129 --> 00:37:58,882
You know, this needs to be brought
before the supreme council for inquiry.

392
00:37:59,466 --> 00:38:01,050
Do you believe her?

393
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:03,887
I have no doubts regarding
number 25's abilities.

394
00:38:04,013 --> 00:38:06,306
We have lots of data
that substantiate it.

395
00:38:06,432 --> 00:38:08,808
What do you believe, Colonel?

396
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:14,314
I'll tell you, my job isn't to believe
or disbelieve. It's to act or not act!

397
00:38:26,952 --> 00:38:31,831
Here, sir. Cold gear, Colonel.
Please put it on. You too, doctor.

398
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:48,348
The other day, a young researcher
came to me and asked me something.

399
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:52,602
He wondered if their power was
the form of the next stage...

400
00:38:52,853 --> 00:38:57,106
that human evolution was taking, and perhaps
we would all be able to control it some day.

401
00:38:57,232 --> 00:39:00,610
Scientists are
a bunch of romantics.

402
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:04,364
Military men, on the other hand,
always consider the risks first.

403
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,866
Over 30 years it's taken.

404
00:39:06,992 --> 00:39:10,536
We've come so far
crawling up from the rubble.

405
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:12,872
We can't just trade one
for the other.

406
00:39:12,998 --> 00:39:16,061
But I've always thought that
you held a resentment...

407
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:17,919
even a hatred for this city, Colonel.

408
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:22,423
The passion to build has cooled,
and the joy of reconstruction forgotten.

409
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:26,886
Now... Now it's just a garbage heap
made up of a bunch of hedonistic fools.

410
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:30,890
But in spite of that,
you're trying to save the city.

411
00:39:31,016 --> 00:39:34,435
I'm not a scientist.
I think like a soldier.

412
00:39:38,273 --> 00:39:40,149
Colonel, we're here, sir.

413
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:42,151
This way, please.

414
00:40:02,297 --> 00:40:05,675
Room 10, 148 degrees Kelvin.

415
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:09,012
Fluctuation tolerance range, check.

416
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:11,180
Room 9, 118 degrees Kelvin.

417
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:13,349
Fluctuation tolerance, check.

418
00:40:13,475 --> 00:40:15,810
Emergency power generator, check.

419
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:17,247
Open the door.

420
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:19,022
- Open the door.
- Sir. Um...

421
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:20,458
The control room. Do it!

422
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:21,962
- The control room. Do it!
- Yes, sir!

423
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:42,712
Room 1 is at 0.0005 degrees Kelvin.

424
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:46,799
It's within tolerance range. No
abnormalities detected in any of the rooms...

425
00:40:46,925 --> 00:40:49,302
dewar walls or defence system.

426
00:40:49,428 --> 00:40:53,222
No abnormal atmospheric concentrations
or reactions recorded.

427
00:40:53,348 --> 00:40:55,725
So then all systems are normal.

428
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:06,903
Look at what they abandoned
in their panic.

429
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:10,990
They were afraid. They were too scared,
so they hid it away from the public...

430
00:41:11,116 --> 00:41:15,745
losing all sense of shame and hon our,
casting aside the civilization...

431
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:18,372
and abandoning the science
that created it.

432
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:22,919
Shutting the lid of the Pandora's
box they, themselves, had opened!

433
00:41:27,216 --> 00:41:27,859
Ryu!

434
00:41:27,883 --> 00:41:29,926
- Ryu!
- Hey, we're still young.

435
00:41:30,094 --> 00:41:30,320
Ryu!

436
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:32,220
- Ryu!
- We could start over again.

437
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:34,365
I'll go with you.

438
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:35,181
- I'll go with you.
- Ryu!

439
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,933
Turn yourself in!

440
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:39,018
This was the first time
you killed a man, right?

441
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:39,704
Ryu!

442
00:41:39,728 --> 00:41:42,772
- Ryu!
- Anyway, when you get out...

443
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:47,360
let's go out for drinks.
Don't kick yourself over it.

444
00:41:47,486 --> 00:41:51,280
What's done is done.
You've heard that.

445
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:59,789
Identify yourselves!

446
00:42:00,874 --> 00:42:03,292
Ryu! Oh, are you all right?

447
00:42:03,418 --> 00:42:04,062
Kei, it's you!

448
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:05,461
- Kei, it's you!
- Ryu!

449
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:07,797
Who's this?

450
00:42:08,257 --> 00:42:10,133
Who? Me?

451
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:14,220
Well, I guess if I say that I'm Kei's
boyfriend, it's stretching it a bit.

452
00:42:14,263 --> 00:42:15,972
It depends on your point of view.

453
00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:18,599
But we haven't gotten
physical or anything.

454
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:19,577
You understand, don't you?

455
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:20,268
- You understand, don't you?
- Are you a spy?

456
00:42:20,352 --> 00:42:20,912
No, I'm not!

457
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:22,096
- No, I'm not!
- You're lying!

458
00:42:26,942 --> 00:42:28,586
Well, is he a spy or not?

459
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,487
- Well, is he a spy or not?
- Whatever he is, he's certainly not a spy.

460
00:42:31,864 --> 00:42:33,781
Ow!

461
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:37,243
Sneak into their lab?

462
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:40,079
Ridiculous!
Remember the fiasco with that kid?

463
00:42:40,205 --> 00:42:43,457
They're last-minute orders,
and the plan is in place already.

464
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:49,172
These are the lab passes
they issue once a week.

465
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:51,424
From Mr. Nezu, right?

466
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,426
What's the objective?

467
00:42:53,552 --> 00:42:55,845
We're to gather detailed
data on the new subject.

468
00:42:55,971 --> 00:42:57,699
A new subject?

469
00:42:57,723 --> 00:42:58,848
- A new subject?
- Yes.

470
00:42:58,974 --> 00:43:03,853
Last week, on the same night we tried to abduct
the experimental subject called number 26...

471
00:43:03,979 --> 00:43:08,691
a boy who was in an accident on an
old city highway was brought to the lab.

472
00:43:08,817 --> 00:43:11,652
It seems that he's a student
at a vocational training school...

473
00:43:11,778 --> 00:43:14,947
but now he's their new subject
for human experimentation.

474
00:43:15,073 --> 00:43:16,157
Huh?

475
00:43:19,077 --> 00:43:21,370
Ow, ouch!!

476
00:43:21,496 --> 00:43:24,290
Hey, hey, hey!
What's the big idea?

477
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:25,476
You!

478
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,061
Should I kill him? He heard us.

479
00:43:27,085 --> 00:43:27,793
- Should I kill him? He heard us.
- Ryu?

480
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,797
Wait! Now just hold on a minute!
Hear me out. Please listen to me!

481
00:43:31,924 --> 00:43:33,216
Ryu, he did save me.

482
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:34,319
Yeah! Twice!

483
00:43:34,343 --> 00:43:36,404
- Yeah! Twice!
- Maybe he did it just to get close to us.

484
00:43:36,428 --> 00:43:39,805
The guy who was in that accident
in the old city is my friend.

485
00:43:39,932 --> 00:43:43,059
I know it's hard for you to believe
what I'm saying, but it's the truth.

486
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:45,144
I was right there when it happened!

487
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:50,066
Come on! Don't they say the only
foolish questions are unasked ones?

488
00:43:51,235 --> 00:43:52,526
They don't?

489
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:57,406
That's an intriguing story, isn't it?

490
00:43:57,532 --> 00:44:00,368
Well, will you be
taking the boy with you?

491
00:44:00,494 --> 00:44:04,497
He knows the subject and I think we can
use him as a decoy if we find it necessary.

492
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:08,084
Neo Tokyo is going
to change soon.

493
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:11,921
In all respects,
this city is saturated.

494
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:14,090
It's like an overripe fruit.

495
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:16,759
Buried within it is a new seed.

496
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,680
We need only wait for the wind
which will make it fall to fruition...

497
00:44:21,014 --> 00:44:23,099
The wind called "Akira".

498
00:44:24,393 --> 00:44:26,560
Ryu, look over here.

499
00:44:27,896 --> 00:44:29,063
What is it?

500
00:44:29,147 --> 00:44:31,524
We aren't the ones who will change it...

501
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:34,694
but rather, those citizens
who hope for Akira that will.

502
00:44:36,071 --> 00:44:39,448
That which is called science
perverts providence!

503
00:44:39,574 --> 00:44:42,368
That which is called progress
encourages extravagance!

504
00:44:42,494 --> 00:44:45,955
That which is called civilization
devastates the spirit of man!

505
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:49,709
The time of atonement is upon us!
Are your hearts prepared?

506
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:54,297
The time is nigh!
The time of his awakening is nigh!

507
00:44:54,423 --> 00:44:57,633
The moment of lord Akira's
awakening is drawing closer!

508
00:44:57,759 --> 00:44:58,820
Are your minds prepared?

509
00:44:58,844 --> 00:45:00,905
- Are your minds prepared?
- Break it up!

510
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:03,222
Holding meetings here
is prohibited.

511
00:45:03,265 --> 00:45:05,308
This gathering is illegal!

512
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:10,229
Terrorist activities carried out
by anti government elements...

513
00:45:10,355 --> 00:45:11,981
have skyrocketed this month.

514
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:16,569
The army, riot squad and even the
traffic police have been fully mobilized.

515
00:45:16,695 --> 00:45:19,655
The overtime costs alone have
used up the public safety budget.

516
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:21,991
And then there's
the abduction of number 26.

517
00:45:22,117 --> 00:45:25,328
Isn't their existence supposed to be
the highest of state secrets, Colonel?

518
00:45:25,454 --> 00:45:28,831
No one's ever heard of peace
and order in Neo Tokyo then?

519
00:45:28,957 --> 00:45:32,835
And this, this request of yours
for further... Ah, yes...

520
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:37,590
for further funding because of
subject number 25's prediction.

521
00:45:37,758 --> 00:45:42,011
You must be joking! While straightening
out the historic tax-reform blunders...

522
00:45:42,137 --> 00:45:45,283
of our former Prime Minister, we parliament
members have been bowing our heads down...

523
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,516
and begging the public
to bear with us.

524
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:52,688
And what does he ask for? Money! Where,
exactly, do we get that kind of money?

525
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:54,523
You've already spent
a fortune here...

526
00:45:54,649 --> 00:45:57,360
and all we have to show for it
is that grotesque kindergarten!

527
00:45:57,652 --> 00:46:00,154
The Olympics is next year,
and the postwar period is over.

528
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,783
How much longer will you keep throwing
away money on these worthless ghosts?

529
00:46:03,909 --> 00:46:07,328
I always said we should put that
money into the welfare program!

530
00:46:07,412 --> 00:46:08,473
Shut up, old man!

531
00:46:08,497 --> 00:46:09,330
What was that?

532
00:46:09,414 --> 00:46:12,958
Now listen here! That power is starting
to walk around free as we speak.

533
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:17,880
Unless we control that power now, we'll
lose everything we tried so hard to achieve.

534
00:46:18,006 --> 00:46:21,717
- Take that "old man" comment back!
- Your lack of policy started this mess!

535
00:46:21,927 --> 00:46:26,180
There's still no proof that the last world
war was caused by Akira, in my opinion.

536
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:27,723
Don't you understand?

537
00:46:27,808 --> 00:46:32,228
Unless an Akira disaster actually happens...
Don't you people understand anything?

538
00:46:32,687 --> 00:46:35,147
Has anyone ever seen the "Akira"...?

539
00:46:35,315 --> 00:46:37,566
Akira was number 25, wasn't he?

540
00:46:37,776 --> 00:46:39,318
He should be number 21.

541
00:46:39,528 --> 00:46:42,571
I say that the colonel has lost
sight of his duty as a soldier!

542
00:46:43,782 --> 00:46:47,910
And I have had several reports on
anti government elements...

543
00:46:48,036 --> 00:46:52,039
how they're using your Akira madness
to whip up their terrorist fervour.

544
00:46:52,124 --> 00:46:53,749
It's not true. It's just not!

545
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:56,377
Then what about that
Akira world renewal movement?

546
00:46:56,628 --> 00:46:58,548
Wouldn't you say that
information's being leaked?

547
00:46:58,713 --> 00:47:01,924
World renewal movement?
It's more like the end of the world.

548
00:47:02,217 --> 00:47:06,053
Aren't you just using Akira as camouflage
to cover up your misconduct? Admit it!

549
00:47:06,221 --> 00:47:07,763
What are you getting at?

550
00:47:07,973 --> 00:47:09,348
Colonel...

551
00:47:09,641 --> 00:47:16,605
Understand that we can no longer leave the
peace of Neo Tokyo to your sole discretion.

552
00:47:16,731 --> 00:47:17,773
Get rid of him!

553
00:47:17,816 --> 00:47:21,110
I'm sorry, but you are to be
put before an inquiry committee.

554
00:47:21,236 --> 00:47:22,445
He should be suspended!

555
00:47:26,241 --> 00:47:27,241
Excuse me!

556
00:47:27,576 --> 00:47:28,576
What?

557
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:31,245
This discussion isn't over!

558
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:32,473
This is an outrage!

559
00:47:32,497 --> 00:47:34,392
- This is an outrage!
- You should explain yourself!

560
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:36,792
Are you trying to insult
the supreme executive council?

561
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,277
Water.

562
00:48:36,436 --> 00:48:38,312
Hey. Wait a minute.

563
00:48:38,605 --> 00:48:42,024
Let's see. Isn't that cable
replacement due for next week?

564
00:48:42,317 --> 00:48:45,778
Well, the cable they ordered
came in a whole week early.

565
00:48:45,904 --> 00:48:50,032
And besides, I've got vacation time
coming, and I'm leaving this weekend.

566
00:48:50,158 --> 00:48:52,826
If I bring the workers back,
there'll be overtime.

567
00:48:53,161 --> 00:48:57,623
I could leave now and come back, but
the work's gotta be done sooner or later.

568
00:49:02,837 --> 00:49:04,797
All right, guys. Let's go.

569
00:50:35,096 --> 00:50:36,138
What the...!

570
00:51:06,252 --> 00:51:08,087
It's milk.

571
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:16,762
Stay away!

572
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:24,520
- Whaa!
- Whoa!

573
00:51:30,151 --> 00:51:30,961
It's blood!

574
00:51:30,985 --> 00:51:32,945
- It's blood!
- I'm scared.

575
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:42,329
Weirdo!

576
00:51:42,497 --> 00:51:45,040
What? Those kids...

577
00:52:40,889 --> 00:52:44,099
"Patient, Room 887.
Shima, Tetsuo."

578
00:52:44,225 --> 00:52:46,685
Oh. The automatic lock's off?

579
00:52:51,816 --> 00:52:54,860
Hey, you! You're not
allowed to leave your room!

580
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:01,617
Let's go back into your room.

581
00:53:01,743 --> 00:53:02,970
What happened?

582
00:53:02,994 --> 00:53:04,578
- What happened?
- Looks terrible.

583
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:30,979
There are 58 blocks with circuits
that the computer won't display.

584
00:53:31,105 --> 00:53:34,983
Of those, nearly 40 are concentrated
on underground levels 7 and 8.

585
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:36,819
That's probably the place.

586
00:53:38,947 --> 00:53:41,824
The central wiring shaft
should be straight up ahead.

587
00:53:42,283 --> 00:53:44,993
We'll be able to use that to go
straight down to the sublevels.

588
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,289
Be careful.
It's deeper in the middle.

589
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:50,935
Whew. What a stink.

590
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:52,167
Don't you ever stop talking?

591
00:53:52,252 --> 00:53:56,171
I said it stinks because it stinks.
Is your nose busted?

592
00:53:56,297 --> 00:53:57,923
Keep up and be quiet!

593
00:53:59,133 --> 00:54:01,343
Damn! Hug the walls!

594
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:03,679
Huh?
What are you guys doing?

595
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:06,098
You idiot, get down!

596
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:23,031
Looks like they beefed up security,
doesn't it?

597
00:54:23,157 --> 00:54:24,385
Must be that siren we heard.

598
00:54:24,409 --> 00:54:26,303
- Must be that siren we heard.
- Should we scout a way around it?

599
00:54:26,327 --> 00:54:27,721
No. Let's keep going.

600
00:54:27,745 --> 00:54:28,931
- No. Let's keep going.
- Hey. Are you okay?

601
00:54:28,955 --> 00:54:31,957
I want to check their security
at the very least.

602
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,626
Damn! They spotted us!
Run for it!

603
00:54:36,671 --> 00:54:38,797
Don't shoot! Hold your fire!

604
00:54:42,343 --> 00:54:44,219
Shimazaki!

605
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:46,282
You assholes!

606
00:54:46,306 --> 00:54:47,973
- You assholes!
- Forget it! Run!

607
00:54:51,352 --> 00:54:53,061
What the hell is that thing?

608
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:55,856
It's coming back!

609
00:54:56,816 --> 00:54:58,191
Don't shoot!

610
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,243
This is unit 304, Shaft "H".

611
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:11,747
I have encountered intruders.
Requesting backup. Now engaging.

612
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:14,583
Here it comes!

613
00:55:39,484 --> 00:55:41,193
Oh! Kei!

614
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:45,697
The gun!

615
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:47,699
Damn it!

616
00:55:50,244 --> 00:55:51,620
Kaneda!

617
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:03,632
Kei! Over here!

618
00:56:04,592 --> 00:56:05,968
Now!

619
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,888
Kaneda, come on! Hurry!

620
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:26,071
Kaneda, no!

621
00:56:39,419 --> 00:56:41,420
What the hell...
Where are the brakes?

622
00:56:41,546 --> 00:56:43,190
That's not it.

623
00:56:43,214 --> 00:56:45,526
- That's not it.
- This is the central wiring shaft, I think.

624
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:46,443
I can't figure it out!

625
00:56:46,467 --> 00:56:47,947
- I can't figure it out!
- What the...

626
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:55,350
There now.
That's right. Behave.

627
00:56:55,601 --> 00:56:58,145
Ask the colonel for clearance
on the use of firearms.

628
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:00,022
Hey. Turn the radio up.

629
00:57:00,148 --> 00:57:01,773
There must be some mistake here.

630
00:57:01,816 --> 00:57:04,693
That boy looks like the patient
admitted in the lab.

631
00:57:04,819 --> 00:57:07,863
Correct. Tetsuo Shima.
He broke out of his ward.

632
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:09,967
He's headed for "the baby room".

633
00:57:09,991 --> 00:57:11,301
- He's headed for "the baby room".
- It's Tetsuo?

634
00:57:11,325 --> 00:57:16,621
He's extremely dangerous.
Do not let him through!

635
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:46,026
Huh? What...?

636
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:55,243
It's no use hiding any more.

637
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,746
We have no choice, then.
Use your guns!

638
00:57:57,872 --> 00:58:01,249
We can't let him go any further,
no matter what it takes!

639
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:03,085
Fire!

640
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,960
Good. All here, are you?

641
00:58:50,758 --> 00:58:51,925
Stop it!

642
00:58:54,428 --> 00:58:56,805
So how long are you gonna
keep playing around?

643
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:05,647
Where's the other one
hiding, huh?

644
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:08,441
Hey, you!
You're a cretin!

645
00:59:08,609 --> 00:59:09,609
Huh?

646
00:59:09,777 --> 00:59:11,153
Die!

647
00:59:14,031 --> 00:59:15,490
Takashi!

648
00:59:25,626 --> 00:59:30,630
What the hell is going on
with me? Am I dreaming?

649
00:59:30,965 --> 00:59:34,009
These powers, are they real
or just a hallucination?

650
00:59:41,642 --> 00:59:43,685
Damn it!
Where the hell am I going?

651
00:59:43,895 --> 00:59:47,189
Proceed straight.
Proceed straight ahead.

652
00:59:47,732 --> 00:59:48,607
Huh?

653
00:59:48,649 --> 00:59:50,692
You'll find a freight elevator just ahead.

654
00:59:52,987 --> 00:59:55,780
You can take it down
to sublevel 8.

655
01:00:03,998 --> 01:00:06,666
That's good.
You're all together.

656
01:00:08,002 --> 01:00:09,544
You thought you could kill me?

657
01:00:09,837 --> 01:00:11,546
I'm through with it.

658
01:00:11,672 --> 01:00:15,550
You tried to mess with me,
and now I'm gonna kill you!

659
01:00:15,927 --> 01:00:17,052
Huh?

660
01:00:21,682 --> 01:00:23,725
You were there. I remember.

661
01:00:24,101 --> 01:00:24,893
Takashi!

662
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:25,495
Huh?

663
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:27,062
- Huh?
- Together, let's attack him.

664
01:00:27,647 --> 01:00:28,647
O... Okay.

665
01:00:33,861 --> 01:00:35,820
You little twerps!

666
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:53,838
All of you, that is enough!

667
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:04,516
Who the hell are you?

668
01:01:07,561 --> 01:01:10,272
What's the matter?
Is your head hurting?

669
01:01:10,398 --> 01:01:13,275
Tetsuo Shima, your power
isn't fully matured yet.

670
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:17,237
If you push yourself, you might do
irreparable damage. We can help.

671
01:01:17,488 --> 01:01:21,116
What the hell?
What... did you people do?

672
01:01:21,242 --> 01:01:22,617
You messed with my head!

673
01:01:31,002 --> 01:01:32,919
Tetsuo Shima, calm yourself.

674
01:01:33,045 --> 01:01:34,963
But he can't control it, sir.

675
01:01:40,344 --> 01:01:41,428
What'd you say?

676
01:01:41,595 --> 01:01:43,805
She said that big people
like you...

677
01:01:43,931 --> 01:01:46,641
should never use the power
in the way that you are.

678
01:01:46,767 --> 01:01:48,643
And bad things will come of it.

679
01:01:49,061 --> 01:01:51,438
Mind your own business,
will you?

680
01:01:54,191 --> 01:01:57,485
What?
More powerful than I am now?

681
01:02:00,114 --> 01:02:04,659
He's the one! He's the one who's been
invading my head all along!

682
01:02:04,952 --> 01:02:05,952
Where is he?

683
01:02:06,037 --> 01:02:07,954
Where's this "Akira"?
Tell me now!

684
01:02:08,122 --> 01:02:08,747
What?

685
01:02:08,873 --> 01:02:12,834
Kiyoko says you'll wake him up
and if you awaken Akira like that...

686
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,503
when that happens,
no one will be able to stop him.

687
01:02:15,629 --> 01:02:17,505
To prevent it,
we have to stop you.

688
01:02:17,882 --> 01:02:19,776
Ridiculous. Akira's already...!

689
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,843
Where is he?

690
01:02:24,096 --> 01:02:25,115
No! Don't!

691
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:26,264
- No! Don't!
- Stay back!

692
01:02:32,229 --> 01:02:36,024
Red level to facility integrity
has passed level 7.

693
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:39,027
Enacting disaster protocol.

694
01:02:40,237 --> 01:02:43,656
Red level to facility integrity
has passed level 7.

695
01:02:43,824 --> 01:02:46,701
Enacting disaster protocol.

696
01:02:47,286 --> 01:02:48,370
Wha...?!

697
01:02:55,669 --> 01:02:57,670
Hands up! Now!

698
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:02,384
Where in the hell's
the frigging' baby room?

699
01:03:21,362 --> 01:03:23,655
Heads up!

700
01:03:23,781 --> 01:03:25,657
Coming through!

701
01:03:27,034 --> 01:03:28,576
Kiyoko.

702
01:03:49,056 --> 01:03:50,348
That hurt.

703
01:03:50,558 --> 01:03:51,558
Kaneda.

704
01:03:51,809 --> 01:03:53,935
What are you doing in here?

705
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:59,607
Tetsuo! You okay?
I'm here to rescue you.

706
01:04:02,194 --> 01:04:04,028
Hurry up!
What are you, stupid?

707
01:04:04,155 --> 01:04:06,197
If we don't get
out of here, those...

708
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:07,949
Huh?

709
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:10,618
There he is! Capture him!

710
01:04:12,246 --> 01:04:14,414
You keep away!

711
01:04:19,086 --> 01:04:20,253
Kaneda!

712
01:04:22,673 --> 01:04:25,133
Oh, that's right.
I forgot you were there.

713
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:29,220
There. Do you see, Kaneda?

714
01:04:29,346 --> 01:04:33,099
I won't be needing you to come
to the rescue ever again, okay?

715
01:04:33,934 --> 01:04:36,811
From now on, I'll be in
charge of the heroics...

716
01:04:37,021 --> 01:04:40,106
so if you need any saving,
just ask, Kanny.

717
01:04:40,357 --> 01:04:44,652
Damn it, Tetsuo. Who the hell do you think
you're talking to, you moron?

718
01:04:45,613 --> 01:04:48,823
Ha! You don't like
what you're hearing, do you?

719
01:04:48,949 --> 01:04:52,160
Makes you angry. So what are
you gonna do now?

720
01:04:52,286 --> 01:04:55,497
Well, Kaneda?
What are you gonna do now?

721
01:05:05,466 --> 01:05:07,175
That's enough!

722
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:10,678
Stop it!
Don't hurt anyone else!

723
01:05:12,223 --> 01:05:14,182
Where's this Akira?

724
01:05:14,975 --> 01:05:15,975
I won't tell.

725
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:19,854
Olympic stadium...
Underground.

726
01:05:20,314 --> 01:05:23,358
No! Don't! What you're
thinking is wrong! Akira is...

727
01:05:25,402 --> 01:05:26,611
Oh! Wait!

728
01:05:36,705 --> 01:05:37,747
What the hell?

729
01:05:38,582 --> 01:05:41,167
I can do this too?

730
01:05:47,341 --> 01:05:49,342
Kiyoko, are you all right?

731
01:05:49,593 --> 01:05:51,177
It doesn't look like she's hurt.

732
01:05:51,345 --> 01:05:54,157
What about you, Masaru?
You're bleeding.

733
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:55,682
Where'd he go to?

734
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,642
He flew away.

735
01:05:57,685 --> 01:05:59,811
How can he have so much power?

736
01:06:02,273 --> 01:06:04,065
How could this have happened?

737
01:06:04,191 --> 01:06:06,150
Damn it!
Where are my men at?

738
01:06:06,277 --> 01:06:09,821
He's developed so much power
in such a short time, it's unbelievable.

739
01:06:10,197 --> 01:06:12,323
Find him!
Start searching for Tetsuo.

740
01:06:12,616 --> 01:06:12,926
Find him!

741
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:15,076
- Find him!
- Kaneda, come on! Get up!

742
01:06:16,036 --> 01:06:18,246
Somebody, help me
with this rock.

743
01:06:20,874 --> 01:06:22,352
Tetsuo went to where Akira is.

744
01:06:22,376 --> 01:06:23,687
- Tetsuo went to where Akira is.
- What?

745
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:26,588
That's good.
You're all safe.

746
01:06:26,714 --> 01:06:30,425
He's heading for the facility below
the Olympic construction site.

747
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:32,594
How'd he find out about it?

748
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:39,684
Damn it! You're saying
that he's managed to escape?

749
01:06:43,188 --> 01:06:45,773
Then we'll follow him.
Prepare for pursuit!

750
01:06:45,983 --> 01:06:47,043
He's heading west toward the stadium.

751
01:06:47,067 --> 01:06:49,129
- He's heading west toward the stadium.
- Come on! Move!

752
01:06:49,153 --> 01:06:52,593
I want additional checkpoints on all outbound
streets leading to the construction site.

753
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,616
It was you.

754
01:07:00,998 --> 01:07:02,874
According
to the security team...

755
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,627
reviews of tapes showed five
intruders disguised as workers...

756
01:07:05,753 --> 01:07:07,462
entering the wiring shaft.

757
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:10,632
I have to stop him
before his powers mature.

758
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:14,761
Your objective is the boy,
Tetsuo Shima.

759
01:07:15,012 --> 01:07:19,057
If we are unable to capture him, we'll
lure him out to the old city and attack.

760
01:07:19,183 --> 01:07:21,559
Request assistance from
the Eastern district battalion.

761
01:07:21,685 --> 01:07:22,245
Yes, sir.

762
01:07:22,269 --> 01:07:24,771
- Yes, sir.
- Tell them there isn't a moment to lose here.

763
01:07:26,857 --> 01:07:28,816
I've been waiting here
a long time, Colonel.

764
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:32,236
What are you doing here?

765
01:07:33,447 --> 01:07:37,659
I'm here to inform you of the supreme
executive council's decision.

766
01:07:39,411 --> 01:07:41,954
"At 2400 hours today,
the colonel is hereby..."

767
01:07:42,081 --> 01:07:43,956
"Stripped of his command
and rank..."

768
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:46,000
"And shall be placed
under arrest."

769
01:07:46,293 --> 01:07:48,002
What the hell?

770
01:07:48,295 --> 01:07:50,630
Kindly accompany us now.

771
01:07:50,881 --> 01:07:55,677
You really expect me to hand Neo Tokyo
over to those fools at a time like this?

772
01:07:57,262 --> 01:07:58,281
Shoot him.

773
01:07:58,305 --> 01:07:59,305
- Shoot him.
- Yes, sir.

774
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:02,517
What? No! Wait!
Hold on! No!

775
01:08:04,478 --> 01:08:07,980
Enough! Open your eyes
and look at the big picture!

776
01:08:08,107 --> 01:08:10,692
You're all puppets of corrupt
politicians and capitalists!

777
01:08:15,614 --> 01:08:19,033
Don't you understand?
It's utterly pointless to fight each other.

778
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:27,875
Announce a state of emergency, and arrest
all members of the executive council.

779
01:08:28,001 --> 01:08:30,002
Break their chain of command.

780
01:08:30,129 --> 01:08:32,213
Lift off!
We're going after Tetsuo.

781
01:08:32,506 --> 01:08:34,215
Urgent message. Repeat, urgent.

782
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:36,217
To all district
battalion commanders.

783
01:08:46,186 --> 01:08:49,897
Yo! What's up?
You're alone?

784
01:08:51,859 --> 01:08:54,736
That's right.
Weren't you in an accident?

785
01:08:54,862 --> 01:08:57,739
Your friends have been
really worried. You okay?

786
01:08:58,031 --> 01:09:00,491
Give me some... capsules.

787
01:09:00,826 --> 01:09:03,536
Huh? You sure
you want capsules, son?

788
01:09:03,662 --> 01:09:05,580
You look kinda woozy.

789
01:09:05,873 --> 01:09:07,582
You better get 'em now.

790
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:08,916
All right.

791
01:09:09,042 --> 01:09:12,754
Whatever the customer wants, you know, but
with all those terrorist attacks lately...

792
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,381
and the demonstrations,
things are pretty rough.

793
01:09:15,632 --> 01:09:19,677
In fact, they're hard to come by, so
the price is pretty expensive, right?

794
01:09:25,893 --> 01:09:28,936
Tetsuo's run off somewhere,
Kaneda's disappeared.

795
01:09:29,062 --> 01:09:30,688
Damn, I guess
the team is finished.

796
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:33,399
And the checkpoints are
so strict these days.

797
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,777
Even the Clowns are laying low.

798
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:45,995
Look!

799
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:51,459
He's dead!

800
01:09:51,543 --> 01:09:52,543
What?

801
01:09:54,171 --> 01:09:56,047
Who's that?

802
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:03,054
It's Tetsuo.

803
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:06,891
Why... Why are you here?

804
01:10:07,768 --> 01:10:10,394
Look who's here.
Wanna pop one?

805
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:12,396
What the hell are you talking about?

806
01:10:12,523 --> 01:10:13,981
What happened here?

807
01:10:14,525 --> 01:10:16,651
Did you notice that
the owner's dead?

808
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,824
An octopus out of water dies, huh?

809
01:10:23,116 --> 01:10:25,743
Are you... Tetsuo...

810
01:10:25,869 --> 01:10:27,263
or someone else?

811
01:10:27,287 --> 01:10:28,287
- Or someone else?
- Huh?

812
01:10:29,122 --> 01:10:31,165
Kaneda sends
his warmest regards.

813
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:33,000
You saw Kaneda?

814
01:10:33,252 --> 01:10:35,253
He's probably dead by now.

815
01:10:38,298 --> 01:10:42,176
You did this, didn't you?

816
01:10:42,302 --> 01:10:46,681
All you're good for now is telling
me where Kaneda's bike is.

817
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:48,349
Tetsuo!

818
01:10:48,475 --> 01:10:51,018
It's a piece of shit anyway.

819
01:10:51,144 --> 01:10:53,187
You son of a bitch!

820
01:10:58,318 --> 01:10:59,485
Yamagata!

821
01:11:06,118 --> 01:11:08,536
God damn it!

822
01:11:15,335 --> 01:11:17,128
So is he off to find Akira?

823
01:11:17,296 --> 01:11:19,213
Yes, that's what that girl was saying.

824
01:11:19,506 --> 01:11:21,465
Now, the army,
Ryu and yourself...

825
01:11:21,592 --> 01:11:23,801
are all trying at once
to find this Akira guy...

826
01:11:23,927 --> 01:11:26,053
and that's also why you're
chasing after Tetsuo.

827
01:11:26,305 --> 01:11:29,181
It must have to do
with the powers he's got.

828
01:11:29,308 --> 01:11:32,310
What the hell is this Akira thing?

829
01:11:35,022 --> 01:11:37,398
I asked Ryu one time.

830
01:11:37,524 --> 01:11:40,651
He told me that Akira
is ultimate energy.

831
01:11:40,819 --> 01:11:42,570
"Ultimate energy"?

832
01:11:42,696 --> 01:11:46,741
Humans do all kinds of things
during their lifetime, right?

833
01:11:46,867 --> 01:11:48,910
Discover things...

834
01:11:49,036 --> 01:11:51,495
Build things...

835
01:11:51,622 --> 01:11:53,915
Things like houses, motorcycles...

836
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,252
bridges and cities, rockets...

837
01:11:59,046 --> 01:12:02,256
So where do you suppose all that
knowledge and energy comes from?

838
01:12:04,509 --> 01:12:07,261
Humans were once
like monkeys, right?

839
01:12:07,971 --> 01:12:09,931
And before that,
like reptiles...

840
01:12:10,057 --> 01:12:11,682
and fish...

841
01:12:11,725 --> 01:12:15,269
and even before that,
plankton and amoebas.

842
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:19,774
Even little creatures like those have
incredible amount of energy inside them.

843
01:12:20,192 --> 01:12:23,444
Oh, yes...
It's in the genes, right?

844
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,446
And even before that.

845
01:12:25,572 --> 01:12:28,783
Maybe there was genetic
material in the air and water...

846
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:30,785
even in the particles
of dust in space.

847
01:12:31,203 --> 01:12:35,539
And if that's the truth, then what sort
of memories are hidden within them?

848
01:12:35,749 --> 01:12:39,627
The beginning of the universe?
Or maybe even before that.

849
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:43,631
What's with all the crazy talk?
Are you sure you're okay?

850
01:12:43,757 --> 01:12:46,197
Listen to yourself. Did you get
bonked on the head back there?

851
01:12:46,385 --> 01:12:49,637
And what if everyone shares
those ancient memories?

852
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:52,932
What if there were some mistakes
in the progression?

853
01:12:53,058 --> 01:12:55,601
Then something goes wrong,
like an amoeba is suddenly given...

854
01:12:55,727 --> 01:12:57,812
the higher powers
that a human has.

855
01:12:59,356 --> 01:13:01,107
Akira is an amoeba then?

856
01:13:02,109 --> 01:13:04,819
Amoebas don't build their own
houses and bridges, do they?

857
01:13:05,195 --> 01:13:07,905
They just devour all the food
they can find around them.

858
01:13:08,115 --> 01:13:10,282
Is that what Tetsuo's doing?

859
01:13:10,409 --> 01:13:12,410
Are you saying he has
that kind of energy?

860
01:13:12,786 --> 01:13:14,495
Long ago...

861
01:13:14,621 --> 01:13:17,790
there were people who tried
to gain control of that power.

862
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:19,959
That is, all of the government's
requests.

863
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:24,463
But they failed in their attempt,
and it triggered the fall of Tokyo.

864
01:13:25,549 --> 01:13:27,425
And that power is...

865
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,510
something that is
totally beyond our...

866
01:13:31,471 --> 01:13:32,471
Wha...!

867
01:13:33,306 --> 01:13:34,473
The door's unlocked.

868
01:13:38,311 --> 01:13:39,437
Huh?

869
01:13:44,735 --> 01:13:47,987
It's a trap.
This is just too good of a setup.

870
01:13:48,113 --> 01:13:48,965
Go back, then.

871
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:49,989
- Go back, then.
- No way.

872
01:13:50,115 --> 01:13:52,616
I wanna find out how much
of a trap it is, don't you?

873
01:13:54,578 --> 01:13:56,537
By the way...

874
01:13:56,663 --> 01:13:59,373
what's going on with you
and that Ryu guy?

875
01:13:59,499 --> 01:14:01,167
What in the world
are you talking about?

876
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:02,270
You're always together.

877
01:14:02,294 --> 01:14:04,534
- You're always together.
- That's none of your business.

878
01:14:05,297 --> 01:14:06,881
No, wait. Hear me out.

879
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:09,967
What I'm saying is, he doesn't
know about us, does he?

880
01:14:10,177 --> 01:14:14,305
"About us"? Hey, wait a minute.
What's that supposed to mean?

881
01:14:14,473 --> 01:14:15,992
Do you think it'll work?

882
01:14:16,016 --> 01:14:17,896
- Do you think it'll work?
- It can't be helped.

883
01:14:17,934 --> 01:14:22,188
At this point in time, our only
option left is to use her.

884
01:14:22,314 --> 01:14:24,398
Well, the fact that,
without us even looking...

885
01:14:24,524 --> 01:14:27,068
she turned up right under
our noses, says as much.

886
01:14:27,194 --> 01:14:29,172
What do you think?

887
01:14:29,196 --> 01:14:30,516
- What do you think?
- I guess so.

888
01:14:44,711 --> 01:14:48,589
We have arrived at ward 13,
East Ginza intersection. Over.

889
01:14:48,715 --> 01:14:51,476
Northern district battalion has not
responded to mobilization request!

890
01:14:52,219 --> 01:14:54,762
Special search team to H.Q.
Special search team to H.Q.

891
01:14:55,055 --> 01:14:58,349
We're at the Harukiya bar near
the highway interchange at ward 8.

892
01:14:58,517 --> 01:15:02,269
It doesn't look like a bomb explosion
to us, so we think it was him.

893
01:15:02,395 --> 01:15:04,855
No, sir, it wasn't
a gas explosion either.

894
01:15:05,148 --> 01:15:08,275
It was almost certainly the work of
the subject that escaped from the lab.

895
01:15:09,236 --> 01:15:11,112
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Understood.

896
01:15:17,369 --> 01:15:19,620
Kaneda, wait!

897
01:15:20,747 --> 01:15:23,124
What? Yamagata's dead?

898
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:26,252
Something seemed strange about him
the second I saw his face.

899
01:15:26,378 --> 01:15:28,963
It's odd. He was wearing what
looked like a white hospital gown.

900
01:15:29,089 --> 01:15:31,132
He acted like a different person.

901
01:15:32,592 --> 01:15:35,136
Yamagata asked him
if he was really Tetsuo...

902
01:15:35,178 --> 01:15:36,720
or if he was someone else.

903
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:41,642
And then he... Yamagata!
Why?

904
01:15:44,688 --> 01:15:46,814
We've always been together.

905
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:48,983
I've known everything
about him ever...

906
01:15:51,111 --> 01:15:53,654
ever since we were
in the children's home together.

907
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:57,324
They tease... Everybody
tried to make him cry.

908
01:15:58,952 --> 01:16:02,163
Oh. He really wanted to know
where your bike was at.

909
01:16:02,789 --> 01:16:04,999
Where my bike was?

910
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:15,259
What are you gonna do?

911
01:16:15,802 --> 01:16:18,179
I'm gonna go send
Yamagata his wheels.

912
01:16:22,809 --> 01:16:25,186
You dumb bastard!

913
01:16:28,607 --> 01:16:29,982
Kaneda!

914
01:16:46,249 --> 01:16:47,249
Kei!

915
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:48,876
What's wrong?

916
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:55,674
That night. You were there.

917
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,013
Wait!

918
01:17:06,853 --> 01:17:08,020
Kei!

919
01:17:12,275 --> 01:17:13,734
They're gone!

920
01:17:15,153 --> 01:17:18,239
You're the one, right?
You changed my friend, didn't you?

921
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:20,199
The thing about Akira's power is...

922
01:17:20,325 --> 01:17:22,910
it exists within everyone
from the start.

923
01:17:23,036 --> 01:17:24,578
Hey, who is that?

924
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:28,666
But when that power
is awakened inside...

925
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:32,086
it is important to wisely
choose how to use it.

926
01:17:32,545 --> 01:17:34,922
When the time comes,
you might not know it...

927
01:17:35,048 --> 01:17:37,216
let alone be prepared for it.

928
01:17:38,218 --> 01:17:41,095
Your friend
has already made his choice.

929
01:17:42,722 --> 01:17:44,765
Tetsuo is our newest companion.

930
01:17:44,891 --> 01:17:46,934
He's our friend also.

931
01:17:48,228 --> 01:17:50,104
His actions are out of control...

932
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:52,106
and for that
we're partly to blame too.

933
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:55,109
Great! Then what in the hell
did you take Kei for?

934
01:17:55,402 --> 01:17:58,112
We're hoping she'll be able
to help us in some way.

935
01:17:58,405 --> 01:18:01,448
They're people, not toys!
Bring her back to me!

936
01:18:01,574 --> 01:18:03,617
And Tetsuo's our friend,
not yours!

937
01:18:03,743 --> 01:18:05,786
If someone's gonna kill him,
it should be us!

938
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:09,623
Hey!

939
01:18:12,544 --> 01:18:16,630
Are you sure? Mr. Omi and the others
have been arrested in the coup d'etat?

940
01:18:16,923 --> 01:18:21,135
Yes, that's right. The house guards
are fighting them right now.

941
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:25,306
Yes. I'd like to have
a helicopter waiting. Yes.

942
01:18:26,891 --> 01:18:29,893
That damn Colonel! I can't
believe he's taken up arms.

943
01:18:32,605 --> 01:18:34,565
I've underestimated him.

944
01:18:39,112 --> 01:18:40,988
Hold them here!

945
01:19:11,561 --> 01:19:13,937
Mr. Nezu, I...

946
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:16,940
Oh! Ryu, is that you?

947
01:19:17,233 --> 01:19:19,193
I came to apologize, sir.

948
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:21,528
The mission was a failure.

949
01:19:21,821 --> 01:19:25,657
Damn you! I told you,
you can't be seen here!

950
01:19:27,285 --> 01:19:29,870
My two best men, they're dead.

951
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,372
Everyone was killed.

952
01:19:31,456 --> 01:19:34,500
You bastard! You sold me out!

953
01:19:34,626 --> 01:19:36,001
What?

954
01:19:39,172 --> 01:19:40,506
Kei!

955
01:19:54,145 --> 01:19:55,354
What?

956
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,356
Yeah, 7th avenue
is just up ahead.

957
01:19:57,482 --> 01:20:00,401
It intersects this road
a hundred meters from here.

958
01:20:04,364 --> 01:20:05,989
Battle stations!

959
01:20:14,374 --> 01:20:17,876
Right! The subject
has been spotted.

960
01:20:18,002 --> 01:20:20,337
What? Attack the kid?

961
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:24,091
But, sir, he's just a boy!
We can't attack him!

962
01:20:28,555 --> 01:20:29,657
Look! There he is!

963
01:20:29,681 --> 01:20:30,597
- Look! There he is!
- It's impossible.

964
01:20:30,682 --> 01:20:31,849
Is this for real?

965
01:20:43,528 --> 01:20:45,362
Fire range preparations
are complete.

966
01:20:48,074 --> 01:20:49,867
Damn it! Fire!

967
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:05,549
Is it Akira?

968
01:21:05,675 --> 01:21:07,551
Look, it's Lord Akira!

969
01:21:08,428 --> 01:21:10,429
Don't be fooled! This isn't the rapture!

970
01:21:10,555 --> 01:21:11,972
He's a false messiah!

971
01:21:13,933 --> 01:21:16,435
Long live Akira!

972
01:21:16,936 --> 01:21:18,312
Fire!

973
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:20,499
What the...

974
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:21,815
- What the...
- What's wrong?

975
01:22:49,362 --> 01:22:52,072
Coming to you live aboard news
chopper 1 high over downtown.

976
01:22:52,198 --> 01:22:55,075
Neo Tokyo broadcasting is exclusively
covering the news today...

977
01:22:55,201 --> 01:22:57,911
in spite of martial law, in the
name of freedom of the press.

978
01:22:57,996 --> 01:23:00,414
What in the world is happening
here in Neo Tokyo?

979
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:03,584
What you see here seem to be
fires caused by tank cannons.

980
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:08,088
But who is this boy standing alone? Is he
fighting the coup d'etat forces by himself?

981
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:10,257
I'm sorry.
We've been ordered to land.

982
01:23:10,383 --> 01:23:12,593
The army has just illegally
ordered us to land!

983
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,054
What is at stake here is freedom of
the press! We've been ordered to...

984
01:23:17,056 --> 01:23:18,367
Did they just get cut off?

985
01:23:18,391 --> 01:23:19,618
- Did they just get cut off?
- What was that?

986
01:23:19,642 --> 01:23:21,935
The bridge!
He's heading for the bridge!

987
01:23:41,748 --> 01:23:43,582
Are you sure you want
to do this alone?

988
01:23:44,584 --> 01:23:46,585
This is what he wants, isn't it?

989
01:23:47,211 --> 01:23:49,630
At least give me time
to get the gang together.

990
01:23:50,214 --> 01:23:51,757
Hey, wait!

991
01:23:51,883 --> 01:23:54,217
I wouldn't want to keep him
waiting now, would I?

992
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:58,138
Hey, Kaneda, hold on!

993
01:24:04,771 --> 01:24:08,106
Half of them seem to be anti government
demonstrators. The rest are...

994
01:24:08,191 --> 01:24:12,319
They're more like some
crazy cult than onlookers.

995
01:24:12,445 --> 01:24:15,614
They're following after the subject,
and more and more keep coming.

996
01:24:18,785 --> 01:24:20,786
Flames of supreme purity...

997
01:24:20,912 --> 01:24:23,413
rain down and raze
the corrupt city...

998
01:24:23,539 --> 01:24:27,000
and drown forever all the
unclean believers of our time!

999
01:24:27,126 --> 01:24:29,002
Give yourselves
into the flame, children...

1000
01:24:29,128 --> 01:24:31,296
and all of you
shall be reborn again!

1001
01:24:31,422 --> 01:24:33,298
Now consume our heart.

1002
01:24:33,424 --> 01:24:36,134
Wash our unclean hearts
in the eternal fire!

1003
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:39,429
Your body is going to be
purified in the flames!

1004
01:24:40,264 --> 01:24:42,099
Ready!

1005
01:24:42,809 --> 01:24:43,285
What?

1006
01:24:43,309 --> 01:24:44,518
- What?
- Fire!

1007
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,360
Set the switch to hold for 3 seconds.
Then converge your beams.

1008
01:24:54,487 --> 01:24:56,530
Aim, fire!

1009
01:25:02,662 --> 01:25:04,538
Watch this!

1010
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:13,213
Look out!
Let's get out of here!

1011
01:25:21,848 --> 01:25:24,891
Save me!

1012
01:25:31,691 --> 01:25:34,234
Ground forces.
Ground forces, come in.

1013
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,403
Report immediately.
What is the subject's status?

1014
01:25:36,654 --> 01:25:38,697
Do you read?

1015
01:25:39,866 --> 01:25:41,533
Line to the doctor.

1016
01:25:41,701 --> 01:25:44,911
We have confirmation of his recent
movements and are in pursuit.

1017
01:25:45,037 --> 01:25:47,372
His present position is...

1018
01:25:47,457 --> 01:25:51,918
coordinates 99871 by 4332.

1019
01:25:52,545 --> 01:25:55,422
That's about 2 kilometres south of
the Olympic construction site...

1020
01:25:55,548 --> 01:25:56,590
in the old city.

1021
01:25:56,716 --> 01:25:57,716
What?

1022
01:26:03,014 --> 01:26:04,890
Where did that blast come from?

1023
01:26:05,016 --> 01:26:05,951
Look!

1024
01:26:05,975 --> 01:26:06,975
- Look!
- Huh?

1025
01:26:07,018 --> 01:26:10,854
That must be out over at the tollbooth
being guarded by the second platoon.

1026
01:26:12,523 --> 01:26:14,024
What the hell?

1027
01:26:17,236 --> 01:26:21,114
Please turn around now.
This area is off-limits to civilians.

1028
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:24,242
Huh? What? That's
the escaped subject? Stop!

1029
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:26,620
Don't come any closer!
Stop, damn it!

1030
01:27:31,435 --> 01:27:34,980
Nice place you have here, isn't it?

1031
01:27:41,988 --> 01:27:45,156
You are the girl
that was with Kaneda.

1032
01:27:45,283 --> 01:27:49,202
You shouldn't use your power in this way,
for it is not correct.

1033
01:27:49,328 --> 01:27:50,954
What's that?

1034
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:55,709
Because in the end, you won't be able to
control it, and it will control you.

1035
01:27:55,835 --> 01:27:58,795
It's the kids talking.
You're those brats, right?

1036
01:28:17,023 --> 01:28:19,065
Nice one!

1037
01:28:40,671 --> 01:28:42,589
What's going on?

1038
01:28:53,059 --> 01:28:54,601
It's not safe here, Colonel!

1039
01:29:35,768 --> 01:29:38,144
All right now. Next move.

1040
01:31:05,357 --> 01:31:06,733
Open now!

1041
01:31:17,703 --> 01:31:19,746
What the hell is this?

1042
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:22,499
That is Akira before you,
Tetsuo.

1043
01:31:22,625 --> 01:31:24,584
That's the Akira
you wanted to meet!

1044
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:28,546
There is your messiah, the chosen one that
you've been looking for.

1045
01:31:28,672 --> 01:31:31,424
Not long after
his transcendental awakening...

1046
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:34,761
his organs and tissues were subjected to
every test known to modern science.

1047
01:31:34,887 --> 01:31:37,764
He's dead. That's it.

1048
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:40,350
What you see there
is all that's left of him.

1049
01:31:49,235 --> 01:31:51,444
And all of the scientists
back then...

1050
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:53,571
were unable to solve
the mystery...

1051
01:31:53,697 --> 01:31:57,700
so they decided to entrust all of
their collected data and test samples...

1052
01:31:57,743 --> 01:32:01,204
to future generations by preserving them
in frozen capsules and locking them away.

1053
01:32:03,415 --> 01:32:04,893
SOL. We will use SOL.

1054
01:32:04,917 --> 01:32:06,077
- SOL. We will use SOL.
- Huh?

1055
01:32:08,254 --> 01:32:10,964
Akira has been dead all this time.

1056
01:32:11,382 --> 01:32:14,134
Well, are you satisfied now,
Tetsuo?

1057
01:32:19,265 --> 01:32:21,432
Now will you return with us?

1058
01:32:21,892 --> 01:32:23,268
Like hell!

1059
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:26,479
Contact the central
defence centre...

1060
01:32:26,605 --> 01:32:30,275
and tell them to patch us through into
SOL's main control circuits right away!

1061
01:32:47,793 --> 01:32:49,085
Hey, watch it, you jerk!

1062
01:32:49,211 --> 01:32:53,173
Move! Get out of the way!
Move it!

1063
01:33:09,481 --> 01:33:12,525
What is this,
a science classroom?

1064
01:33:22,661 --> 01:33:23,786
Huh?

1065
01:33:29,501 --> 01:33:32,212
What's wrong?
Have some trouble?

1066
01:33:32,338 --> 01:33:36,174
Yeah, but I already
took care of it.

1067
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,218
And you're too late.
You missed the show.

1068
01:33:38,344 --> 01:33:40,803
Tetsuo,
you had me worried again.

1069
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:44,015
I figured you'd be standing here,
sobbing like a little baby.

1070
01:33:44,475 --> 01:33:48,728
Kaneda. You've always been
a pain in the ass, you know.

1071
01:33:49,146 --> 01:33:51,898
You've been telling me
what to do since we were kids!

1072
01:33:51,982 --> 01:33:53,900
You always treat me like a kid.

1073
01:33:54,026 --> 01:33:59,030
You always show up and start
bossing me around, and don't you deny it!

1074
01:33:59,156 --> 01:34:03,034
And now you're a boss, too,
of this pile of rumble.

1075
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,512
Kaneda!

1076
01:34:04,536 --> 01:34:06,913
- Kaneda!
- That's "Mister" Kaneda to you, punk!

1077
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:08,998
Die!

1078
01:34:19,009 --> 01:34:20,176
Tetsuo!

1079
01:34:43,575 --> 01:34:45,535
Son of a bitch!

1080
01:34:59,258 --> 01:35:00,258
Kei!

1081
01:35:02,261 --> 01:35:03,720
Oh, damn it!

1082
01:35:07,266 --> 01:35:09,309
Let's do it!

1083
01:35:20,571 --> 01:35:22,488
Gotcha!

1084
01:35:23,282 --> 01:35:24,490
What?

1085
01:35:24,783 --> 01:35:25,783
Huh?

1086
01:35:27,786 --> 01:35:30,330
Huh?
The damn battery's dead!

1087
01:35:30,456 --> 01:35:32,915
What's the matter now, Kaneda?

1088
01:35:34,418 --> 01:35:35,585
Damn it!

1089
01:35:35,711 --> 01:35:38,421
It ain't fair, Tetsuo!
Fight with your bare hands!

1090
01:35:41,925 --> 01:35:42,967
Oh, this is funny!

1091
01:35:45,095 --> 01:35:47,305
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?

1092
01:35:47,431 --> 01:35:50,683
Now do you understand how it feels
being little and helpless?

1093
01:35:53,312 --> 01:35:54,354
Oh?

1094
01:35:56,815 --> 01:35:59,192
Where's this light coming from?

1095
01:36:09,995 --> 01:36:10,889
Were we on target?

1096
01:36:10,913 --> 01:36:12,932
- Were we on target?
- Hard to tell. Too close to the impact point.

1097
01:36:12,956 --> 01:36:13,808
The monitors are
getting too much electrical...

1098
01:36:13,832 --> 01:36:17,032
- The monitors are getting too much electrical...
- Prepare a second volley, now!

1099
01:36:38,357 --> 01:36:40,858
Hey!

1100
01:36:40,984 --> 01:36:42,902
Kaneda!

1101
01:37:01,004 --> 01:37:04,424
Tetsuo!

1102
01:37:19,314 --> 01:37:20,731
Shit!

1103
01:37:22,067 --> 01:37:23,860
What the...

1104
01:37:28,323 --> 01:37:30,116
Wh...!

1105
01:37:59,688 --> 01:38:01,564
Correcting error now
on tracking system.

1106
01:38:01,690 --> 01:38:03,566
T minus 20...

1107
01:38:03,692 --> 01:38:05,318
Get the fire extinguishers!
Are you okay?

1108
01:38:05,402 --> 01:38:06,212
Get that fire out!

1109
01:38:06,236 --> 01:38:08,112
- Get that fire out!
- What's going on?

1110
01:38:17,414 --> 01:38:18,915
Kaneda!

1111
01:38:20,459 --> 01:38:22,126
Kai! Kei!

1112
01:38:22,252 --> 01:38:22,604
Kaneda!

1113
01:38:22,628 --> 01:38:23,336
- Kaneda!
- Kaneda!

1114
01:38:23,629 --> 01:38:24,504
Get on!

1115
01:38:24,588 --> 01:38:25,607
Where?

1116
01:38:25,631 --> 01:38:27,006
- Where?
- Hurry!

1117
01:38:49,154 --> 01:38:51,155
What is that?

1118
01:39:04,795 --> 01:39:06,879
Reports say it's SOL.

1119
01:39:17,808 --> 01:39:19,725
Magnificent.

1120
01:39:29,861 --> 01:39:31,904
When Tetsuo's power
reaches its peak...

1121
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:33,906
is that what you're thinking?

1122
01:39:34,032 --> 01:39:38,202
That's when we do it.
But will it really work?

1123
01:39:39,037 --> 01:39:44,083
We know the future doesn't
necessarily proceed along a single course.

1124
01:39:44,209 --> 01:39:47,670
There ought to be a future we can choose.
It's up to us to find it.

1125
01:39:57,889 --> 01:39:59,701
What's Tetsuo's status, doctor?

1126
01:39:59,725 --> 01:40:01,445
- What's Tetsuo's status, doctor?
- Colonel.

1127
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,437
We set up a camera in the
stadium if you want to check.

1128
01:40:04,813 --> 01:40:07,023
We have him under observation.

1129
01:40:08,317 --> 01:40:12,278
Colonel, you must take a look at this data.
It's phenomenal!

1130
01:40:12,404 --> 01:40:16,115
We're still analysing the energy given off
by the subject, but it's just magnificent.

1131
01:40:16,241 --> 01:40:18,117
Oh, yes, wonderful.

1132
01:40:18,243 --> 01:40:20,953
Of course, this is clearly
a proton collapse.

1133
01:40:21,079 --> 01:40:25,625
We're also detecting a fair number of what we
believe to be unknown particles to science.

1134
01:40:25,751 --> 01:40:28,085
If we can put this into
a theoretical framework...

1135
01:40:28,211 --> 01:40:30,254
then physics...
quantum physics...

1136
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:33,299
humanity itself could know
the fundamental truths.

1137
01:40:35,761 --> 01:40:38,054
Uh... Uh... Well, you see...

1138
01:40:38,096 --> 01:40:40,056
we still haven't finished
making our adjustments.

1139
01:40:40,223 --> 01:40:41,891
Wait, Colonel.

1140
01:40:47,356 --> 01:40:49,315
What the... The pattern!

1141
01:40:51,818 --> 01:40:54,987
You bastard!
What did I tell you?

1142
01:40:55,113 --> 01:40:56,989
But, Colonel...

1143
01:40:57,115 --> 01:40:59,492
I couldn't throw away
such a magnificent subject.

1144
01:41:00,786 --> 01:41:01,786
Shut up!

1145
01:41:24,601 --> 01:41:26,621
Oh! Oh, oh! Oh, shit!

1146
01:41:26,645 --> 01:41:28,354
Quick! The battery!

1147
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,524
Come on!
My bike's burning up!

1148
01:41:31,608 --> 01:41:34,110
Hey, what's losing
a bike or two, huh?

1149
01:41:34,236 --> 01:41:37,279
What? Then there's nothing wrong
with using yours, right?

1150
01:41:37,406 --> 01:41:39,133
I said that out loud, did I?

1151
01:41:39,157 --> 01:41:40,385
- I said that out loud, did I?
- Yeah, you did.

1152
01:41:40,409 --> 01:41:42,326
By the way,
your bike's still on fire.

1153
01:41:42,452 --> 01:41:43,869
Huh? Oh, man! Oh!

1154
01:42:24,327 --> 01:42:26,412
Tetsuo?

1155
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:41,510
Tetsuo, why is everyone calling you Akira?
What does it mean?

1156
01:42:41,636 --> 01:42:43,554
It means nothing.

1157
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,389
He never existed.

1158
01:42:46,391 --> 01:42:48,267
It doesn't matter who he is.
They don't care.

1159
01:42:51,062 --> 01:42:53,063
Just so long as he destroys things.

1160
01:42:54,232 --> 01:42:56,358
What's that?
Your arm! Look at it!

1161
01:42:56,735 --> 01:43:00,112
Well, it doesn't look like much,
but it still works pretty good.

1162
01:43:03,408 --> 01:43:05,785
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1163
01:43:08,246 --> 01:43:09,413
It's nothing!

1164
01:43:10,165 --> 01:43:10,975
Tetsuo, I just...

1165
01:43:10,999 --> 01:43:13,375
- Tetsuo, I just...
- Shut up! Just go away!

1166
01:43:20,509 --> 01:43:21,884
Medicine.

1167
01:43:22,552 --> 01:43:25,930
What's wrong, Tetsuo?
Are you in pain? Huh?

1168
01:43:26,056 --> 01:43:29,308
Go back to the lab
and get that medicine.

1169
01:43:29,434 --> 01:43:31,602
Doctor, did you hear that?

1170
01:43:31,728 --> 01:43:33,164
I did, Colonel.

1171
01:43:33,188 --> 01:43:35,147
- I did, Colonel.
- Well, any signs of it?

1172
01:43:35,607 --> 01:43:37,483
I can't be entirely certain here...

1173
01:43:37,692 --> 01:43:42,321
but it seems that the power which had been
held back by the drugs is breaking free.

1174
01:43:42,447 --> 01:43:45,991
He may not be able to control the power
that has awakened so suddenly!

1175
01:43:46,117 --> 01:43:48,661
He's in an extremely
critical condition!

1176
01:43:49,621 --> 01:43:52,581
Come back to the lab and
receive proper treatment.

1177
01:43:52,624 --> 01:43:54,500
If you don't, you may die.

1178
01:43:56,711 --> 01:44:00,840
You want me to enrol in your kindergarten
and live happily ever after, huh?

1179
01:44:00,966 --> 01:44:02,842
Be quiet
and do what you're told.

1180
01:44:02,968 --> 01:44:06,637
Take your medicine every day
and end up all shrivelled like those kids!

1181
01:44:11,643 --> 01:44:14,854
Kaori.

1182
01:44:18,066 --> 01:44:19,817
Fetch medicine, please.

1183
01:44:19,943 --> 01:44:21,110
No.

1184
01:44:21,778 --> 01:44:22,820
Stop, Tetsuo!

1185
01:44:24,781 --> 01:44:26,031
Tetsuo!

1186
01:44:27,826 --> 01:44:29,159
No, Tetsu...!

1187
01:45:00,942 --> 01:45:02,067
Kaneda!

1188
01:45:40,565 --> 01:45:41,565
Huh?

1189
01:45:49,491 --> 01:45:51,867
Son of a... Huh?

1190
01:45:54,746 --> 01:45:56,914
What are you three... doing here?

1191
01:46:02,921 --> 01:46:05,130
You didn't learn
your lesson, did you?

1192
01:46:07,425 --> 01:46:08,759
Heads up, Tetsuo!

1193
01:46:22,941 --> 01:46:24,566
Takashi.

1194
01:46:27,278 --> 01:46:29,071
Akira's here.

1195
01:46:42,252 --> 01:46:46,005
Help, Kaneda! Help, please!

1196
01:46:55,306 --> 01:46:57,975
Kaori!

1197
01:47:00,311 --> 01:47:03,022
Please, help me!

1198
01:47:14,909 --> 01:47:16,785
Help me!

1199
01:47:16,995 --> 01:47:18,829
Let her go!

1200
01:47:35,805 --> 01:47:39,725
Kaori. Kaori. Kaori!

1201
01:47:39,851 --> 01:47:42,478
Tetsuo, are you there?

1202
01:47:42,604 --> 01:47:45,689
Kaori!
Kaori's gonna die!

1203
01:47:45,815 --> 01:47:48,317
What? What did you say?

1204
01:47:48,443 --> 01:47:52,237
My body's not doing
what I tell it to.

1205
01:47:52,363 --> 01:47:56,158
My power's acting
on its own. Kaori!

1206
01:47:56,326 --> 01:47:58,243
Kaori's dying.

1207
01:47:58,453 --> 01:48:01,038
Kaneda, help me!

1208
01:48:01,164 --> 01:48:05,167
Stop this, Tetsuo!
Stop it now!

1209
01:48:05,293 --> 01:48:08,921
Kaori's pain is coming into me.

1210
01:48:10,548 --> 01:48:12,341
Tetsuo!

1211
01:48:13,510 --> 01:48:17,096
Kaneda, run away!

1212
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:32,236
Tetsuo!

1213
01:48:43,915 --> 01:48:47,876
Kiyoko, Takashi, Masaru!
Hurry! Get away from here!

1214
01:48:51,923 --> 01:48:53,382
Come on!

1215
01:48:59,430 --> 01:49:02,808
I can't believe it. It's as if...

1216
01:49:15,238 --> 01:49:18,157
Kiyoko! Taka...

1217
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:53,192
Hi.

1218
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,695
Akira.

1219
01:50:04,913 --> 01:50:06,830
Oh, no! That's the...

1220
01:50:08,249 --> 01:50:10,334
But that's impossible!

1221
01:50:20,094 --> 01:50:22,471
Where am I?

1222
01:50:22,597 --> 01:50:26,350
Hurry. Get into the tunnel.
You'll be safe in there.

1223
01:50:26,434 --> 01:50:28,477
Kiyoko, where are you?

1224
01:50:30,146 --> 01:50:31,730
Oh...

1225
01:50:43,034 --> 01:50:44,743
Tetsuo!

1226
01:50:44,869 --> 01:50:47,246
Kaneda!

1227
01:50:47,497 --> 01:50:48,914
Hang on!

1228
01:50:51,125 --> 01:50:52,311
Hurry! You've got to get out of here!

1229
01:50:52,335 --> 01:50:53,854
- Hurry! You've got to get out of here!
- Out of the way!

1230
01:50:53,878 --> 01:50:55,272
Tetsuo!

1231
01:50:55,296 --> 01:50:56,880
- Tetsuo!
- Don't go near it!

1232
01:51:03,471 --> 01:51:06,098
No, don't! Wait, Takashi!

1233
01:51:06,224 --> 01:51:09,601
If you went in now, you'd
be trapped along with him.

1234
01:51:09,727 --> 01:51:13,605
But he... None of this
is his fault at all.

1235
01:51:20,905 --> 01:51:22,049
Takashi!

1236
01:51:22,073 --> 01:51:23,615
- Takashi!
- Takashi!

1237
01:51:29,872 --> 01:51:32,624
If we went in there...

1238
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:36,044
we wouldn't be strong enough
to come back out again.

1239
01:51:37,255 --> 01:51:39,589
But if the three of us tried...

1240
01:51:39,716 --> 01:51:41,591
maybe we could save that boy.

1241
01:51:41,718 --> 01:51:44,803
You're right.
Us three together.

1242
01:51:53,938 --> 01:51:58,150
Look at that. We should get
out of here now! Hey!

1243
01:51:59,235 --> 01:52:01,153
Kaneda's in there.

1244
01:52:33,936 --> 01:52:37,647
You see that? You're not revving
your engine enough already.

1245
01:52:37,774 --> 01:52:41,360
When you go into a corner,
lean in suicidally. Got it? Now watch.

1246
01:52:41,444 --> 01:52:43,130
What the hell do you call that?

1247
01:52:43,154 --> 01:52:45,154
- What the hell do you call that?
- Cornering, man.

1248
01:52:46,407 --> 01:52:48,367
You got it, Tetsuo?

1249
01:52:54,707 --> 01:52:57,459
Hey, look! They brought another kid!
Is he a transfer student?

1250
01:52:57,502 --> 01:52:58,812
His mom and dad left him.

1251
01:52:58,836 --> 01:53:01,296
- His mom and dad left him.
- You can see it in his face.

1252
01:53:04,509 --> 01:53:09,304
Are these... Are these all of your dreams
and memories, Tetsuo?

1253
01:53:10,807 --> 01:53:12,724
Uh, wait.

1254
01:54:30,011 --> 01:54:32,471
Is this Akira?

1255
01:54:32,763 --> 01:54:36,224
Yes. We called
him here to the three of us.

1256
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:38,810
He's going to take
Tetsuo with him.

1257
01:54:38,895 --> 01:54:41,813
Take him where?
Where?

1258
01:54:42,023 --> 01:54:44,149
It's too much for Tetsuo...

1259
01:54:44,275 --> 01:54:47,986
and for the three of us also
and for Akira too.

1260
01:54:48,112 --> 01:54:51,656
It's way too big
for us, as we are now.

1261
01:54:51,782 --> 01:54:55,494
But someday we ought
to be able to...

1262
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:58,955
Because it has already begun.

1263
01:54:59,081 --> 01:55:01,500
Your friend, she's...

1264
01:55:01,626 --> 01:55:03,168
My friend?

1265
01:55:04,086 --> 01:55:07,005
Kei! It's Kei
you're talking about!

1266
01:55:32,657 --> 01:55:34,533
Tetsuo.

1267
01:55:38,913 --> 01:55:40,830
This is yours, right?

1268
01:55:46,671 --> 01:55:49,548
They're always like that
with the new kids.

1269
01:55:49,674 --> 01:55:51,049
Hey, you came today, right?

1270
01:55:51,175 --> 01:55:55,554
They beat me up too, but the truth is,
those guys are wimps.

1271
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:58,890
My name is... Tetsuo.

1272
01:55:59,016 --> 01:56:00,392
Tetsuo Shima.

1273
01:56:02,144 --> 01:56:05,146
The truth is,
I just got here myself.

1274
01:56:05,273 --> 01:56:06,982
My name is...

1275
01:56:07,358 --> 01:56:11,570
Kaneda. Kaneda.

1276
01:56:12,029 --> 01:56:13,006
Kaneda!

1277
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:14,030
- Kaneda!
- Kei.

1278
01:56:40,391 --> 01:56:42,934
What in the world is happening?
What's this?

1279
01:56:46,314 --> 01:56:48,440
No, this isn't...

1280
01:56:48,566 --> 01:56:52,611
If this is correct, it's showing
that this is the birth of the universe.

1281
01:56:59,243 --> 01:57:02,370
Kei!

1282
01:57:07,752 --> 01:57:09,794
What's going on here?

1283
01:57:11,922 --> 01:57:13,757
Disappearing.
It's disappearing.

1284
01:58:25,079 --> 01:58:27,330
Kaneda, can you hear me?

1285
01:58:50,688 --> 01:58:52,063
Tetsuo.

1286
01:58:55,151 --> 01:58:57,402
Kaneda, what is it?

1287
01:58:58,028 --> 01:58:59,154
Thank you.

1288
01:58:59,613 --> 01:59:00,613
Huh?

1289
01:59:00,990 --> 01:59:03,908
You called me, didn't you,
and I heard you.

1290
01:59:11,208 --> 01:59:13,585
Kaneda! Oh, my!

1291
01:59:14,295 --> 01:59:15,837
Where's Tetsuo?

1292
01:59:17,047 --> 01:59:18,506
He just left.

1293
01:59:19,550 --> 01:59:22,594
Those kids did too.
Akira also.

1294
01:59:23,053 --> 01:59:25,722
Kaneda, back then...
Oh, did you just...

1295
01:59:27,308 --> 01:59:29,184
Kaneda!

1296
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:31,853
You're alive!

1297
01:59:31,979 --> 01:59:34,105
I thought...

1298
01:59:34,356 --> 01:59:36,733
I thought you were
in there for sure.

1299
01:59:39,570 --> 01:59:41,905
Tetsuo!
What happened to Tetsuo?

1300
01:59:42,573 --> 01:59:43,907
Is he dead?

1301
01:59:44,033 --> 01:59:45,617
I'm not sure.

1302
01:59:46,202 --> 01:59:48,203
Something... Oh!

1303
02:00:13,437 --> 02:00:16,981
But someday we
ought to be able to...

1304
02:00:17,107 --> 02:00:20,485
Because it has already begun.

1305
02:00:38,462 --> 02:00:41,506
I am Tetsuo.
