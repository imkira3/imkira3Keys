00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,915
Once upon a time, in a faraway land,

3
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,751
a young prince lived
in a shining castle.

4
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,047
Although he had everything
his heart desired,

5
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:34,551
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

6
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,055
But then, one winter's night,

7
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,808
an old beggar woman came
to the castle

8
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,727
and offered him a single rose

9
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,231
in return for shelter from the bitter cold.

10
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,900
Repulsed by herhaggard appearance,

11
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:54,696
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away.

12
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,283
But she warned him
not to be deceived by appearances,

13
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,453
forbeauty is found within.

14
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:06,333
And when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away

15
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:10,337
to reveal a beautiful enchantress.

16
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,590
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late,

17
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,261
forshe had seen
that there was no love in his heart.

18
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,387
And as punishment,

19
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,098
she transformed him
into a hideous beast

20
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:25,894
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle and all who lived there.

21
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,439
Ashamed ofhis monstrous form,

22
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,359
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle

23
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,613
with a magic mirror as his only window
to the outside world.

24
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,492
The rose she had offered

25
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,036
was truly an enchanted rose,

26
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,707
which would bloom until his 21st year.

27
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,459
lfhe could learn to love another

28
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:54,214
and earn herlove in return
by the time the last petal fell,

29
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,217
then the spell would be broken.

30
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,762
lfnot, he would be doomed

31
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,724
to remain a beast for all time.

32
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,477
As the years passed,

33
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,940
he fell into despair and lost all hope,

34
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,237
for who could everlearn
to love a beast?

35
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:48,101
Little town, it's a quiet village

36
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:53,231
Every day like the one before

37
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:58,320
Little town, full of little people

38
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:03,533
Waking up to say...

39
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,583
There goes the baker
with his tray, like always

40
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,795
The same old bread and rolls to sell

41
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,630
Every morning just the same

42
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,590
Since the morning that we came

43
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,342
To this poorprovincial town

44
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,219
-Good morning, Belle.
-Morning, monsieur.

45
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,012
-Where you off to?
-The bookshop.

46
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,390
I just finished the most wonderful story

47
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,059
-about a beanstalk and an ogre and...
-That's nice.

48
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,312
Marie, the baguettes! Hurry up!

49
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,024
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question

50
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,361
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

51
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,321
Never part of any crowd

52
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,240
'Cause herhead's up on some cloud

53
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:47,411
No denying she's a funny girl
that Belle

54
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,246
-Bonjour
-Good day

55
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,248
How is your family?

56
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,208
-Bonjour
-Good day

57
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,002
How is your wife?

58
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,920
l need six eggs

59
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,338
That's too expensive

60
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:03,135
There must be more
than this provincial life

61
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,095
-Belle.
-Good morning.

62
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,930
I've come to return the book I borrowed.

63
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,056
Finished already?

64
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,018
I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?

65
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,602
Not since yesterday.

66
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,064
That's all right. I'll borrow this one.

67
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,525
That one? But you've read it twice.

68
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,985
Well, it's my favorite.

69
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,406
Far-off places, daring sword fights,
magic spells, a prince in disguise.

70
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,242
If you like it all that much, it's yours.

71
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,119
-But, sir...
-I insist.

72
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,330
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

73
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,001
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar

74
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,296
l wonder if she's feeling well

75
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,173
With a dreamy, far-offlook

76
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,091
And hernose stuck in a book

77
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,887
What a puzzle to the rest ofus is Belle

78
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,185
lsn't this amazing?

79
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,645
lt's my favorite part

80
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:02,235
Because you'll see

81
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,617
Here's where she meets
Prince Charming

82
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,788
But she won't discover that it's him

83
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,124
Till chapter three

84
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,959
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

85
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,671
Now it's no wonder
that hername means beauty

86
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,966
Herlooks have got no parallel

87
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,676
But behind that fair facade

88
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,720
l'm afraid she's rather odd

89
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,680
Very different from the rest ofus

90
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,432
She's nothing like the rest ofus

91
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,394
Yes, different from the rest ofus
is Belle

92
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,194
Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston.

93
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,196
You're the greatest hunter
in the whole world!

94
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,864
-I know.
-No beast alive

95
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,783
stands a chance against you.

96
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,702
-And no girl, for that matter.
-It's true, LeFou.

97
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,372
And I've got my sights set on that one.

98
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,582
-The inventor's daughter?
-She's the one.

99
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,043
-The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
-But she...

100
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,129
-The most beautiful girl in town.
-I know, but...

101
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,339
That makes her the best.

102
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:08,552
-And don't I deserve the best?
-Well, of course. I mean, you do.

103
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:12,472
Right from the moment
when l met her, saw her

104
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,851
l said she's gorgeous, and l fell

105
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,894
Here in town there's only she

106
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,771
Who is beautiful as me

107
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:24,025
So I'm making pIans
to woo and marry Belle

108
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,902
Look, there he goes

109
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,737
lsn't he dreamy?

110
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,531
Monsieur Gaston

111
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,324
Oh, he's so cute

112
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,118
Be still, my heart

113
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,578
l'm hardly breathing

114
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,915
He's such a tall, dark, strong
and handsome brute

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,584
-Bonjour
-Good day

116
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,502
-You call this bacon?
-What lovely grapes

117
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,753
-Some cheese
-Ten yards

118
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,172
-Excuse me
-l'll get the knife

119
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,132
-Please let me through
-This bread, it's stale

120
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,426
-Those fish, they smell
-Madame's mistaken

121
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,096
There must be more
than this provincial life

122
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:57,392
Justwatch, l'm going
to make Belle my wife

123
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:00,937
Look, there she goes
a girl who's strange but special

124
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,149
A most peculiar mademoiselle

125
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,942
lt's a pity and a sin

126
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,736
She doesn't quite fit in

127
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,779
'Cause she reaIly is a funny girl

128
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,573
A beauty but a funny girl

129
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:16,578
She reaIly is a funny girl

130
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,790
That Belle

131
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,840
-Hello, Belle.
-Bonjour, Gaston.

132
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,926
Gaston, may I have my book, please?

133
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,553
How can you read this?
There's no pictures.

134
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,931
Well, some people
use their imagination.

135
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,850
Belle, it's about time you got
your head out of those books

136
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,478
and paid attention
to more important things.

137
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,812
Like me.

138
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,900
The whole town's talking about it.

139
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,818
It's not right for a woman to read.

140
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,488
Soon she starts getting ideas
and thinking.

141
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,907
Gaston, you are positively primeval.

142
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,909
Why, thank you, Belle.

143
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,245
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern

144
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,498
-and take a look at my trophies?
-Maybe some other time.

145
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,333
-What's wrong with her?
-She's crazy.

146
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,834
He's gorgeous.

147
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,546
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.

148
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,215
Goodbye.

149
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:14,052
That crazy old loon.
He needs all the help he can get.

150
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,929
Don't talk about my father that way.

151
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,515
Yeah! Don't talk
about her father that way.

152
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,226
My father is not crazy. He's a genius.

153
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,826
-Papa?
-How on earth did that happen?

154
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,122
-Doggone it!
-Are you all right, Papa?

155
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,792
I'm... I'm about ready
to give up on this hunk ofjunk.

156
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,671
-You always say that.
-I mean it this time!

157
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,632
I'll never get this
boneheaded contraption to work!

158
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,636
Yes, you will. And you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

159
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,098
And become a world-famous inventor.

160
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,225
You really believe that?

161
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,102
I always have.

162
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:08,398
Well, what are we waiting for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.

163
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,693
Hand me that...
The dog-legged clincher there.

164
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,612
So, did you have a good time
in town today?

165
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,948
I got a new book.

166
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,909
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

167
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,412
My daughter? Odd?

168
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,414
Where would you get an idea like that?

169
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:28,710
I don't know.
It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here.

170
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,670
There's no one I can really talk to.

171
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,215
What about that Gaston?
He's a handsome fella.

172
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,345
He's handsome, all right,
and rude and conceited and...

173
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,096
Papa, he's not for me.

174
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,265
Well, don't you worry.

175
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,019
'Cause this invention's gonna be
the start of a new life for us.

176
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,272
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.

177
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,747
-It works!
-It does?

178
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,125
-It does!
-You did it.

179
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,169
You really did it!

180
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,255
Hitch up Philippe, girl. I'm off to the fair!

181
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,510
Goodbye, Papa. Good luck.

182
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,554
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.

183
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,950
We should be there by now.

184
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,244
Maybe we missed a turn.

185
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,455
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.

186
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,878
No. Let's go this way.

187
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:08,685
Come on, Philippe, it's a shortcut.
We'll be there in no time.

188
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,833
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?

189
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,085
We better turn around.

190
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,799
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.

191
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,971
Look out! No!

192
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,184
Whoa!

193
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,227
Whoa, boy!

194
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,981
Back up, back up, back up!

195
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,068
Good boy. Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!

196
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,821
Steady, steady, now. Steady.

197
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,824
Steady. No, Philippe!

198
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,625
Philippe?

199
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,278
Help! Is... Is someone there?

200
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,405
Help!

201
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,651
Hello?

202
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,114
Hello!

203
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,491
Poor fellow must have lost his way
in the woods.

204
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,995
Keep quiet. Maybe he'll go away.

205
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,038
Is someone there?

206
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,542
Not a word, Lumiere. Not one word.

207
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,838
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse

208
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,716
and I need a place to stay for the night.

209
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,260
Cogsworth, have a heart.

210
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,099
Of course, monsieur,
you are welcome here.

211
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,143
Who said that?

212
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,769
Over here.

213
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,938
-Where?
-Hello.

214
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,193
Incredible!

215
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,029
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.

216
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,364
Splendid. Just peachy.

217
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,493
-How is this accomplished?
-Put me down at once.

218
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,704
Stop that! Stop that, I say!

219
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,838
Sir, close that at once!

220
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:26,382
-Do you mind?
-I beg your pardon.

221
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,927
It's... It's just
that I've never seen a clock that...

222
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,647
You are soaked to the bone, monsieur.

223
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,690
Come. Warm yourself by the fire.

224
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,985
-Thank you.
-No, no, no!

225
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,112
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

226
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,698
I demand that you stop right there.

227
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,286
No, no. Not the master's chair.

228
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,041
I'm not seeing this. I'm not seeing this.

229
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,877
Well, hello there, boy.

230
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,426
-What service.
-All right.

231
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,554
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...

232
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:17,934
How would you like a nice spot of tea,
sir? It'll warm you up in no time.

233
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,270
No. No tea. No tea!

234
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,109
His mustache tickles, Mama.

235
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,195
Hello.

236
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,295
There's a stranger here.

237
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,590
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.

238
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,718
He was cold and wet, so...

239
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,473
Master, I'd like to take this moment
to say

240
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,726
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.

241
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,354
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...

242
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,403
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

243
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,655
I... I... I was lost in the woods and...

244
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,574
You are not welcome here!

245
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,325
I... I'm... I'm sorry.

246
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,328
-What are you staring at?
-Nothing.

247
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,832
So, you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?

248
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,502
Please, I meant no harm!
I just needed a place to stay.

249
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:31,340
-I'll give you a place to stay!
-No, no, please! No! No!

250
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,725
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get
the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?

251
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,060
Yep, this is her lucky day.

252
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,859
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

253
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,279
First, I better go in there
and propose to the girl.

254
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,493
And you, LeFou, now,
when Belle and I come out that door...

255
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,162
I know. I know. I strike up the band!

256
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,793
-Not yet.
-Sorry.

257
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,058
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.

258
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,436
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.

259
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,355
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town

260
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,024
who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.

261
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,776
This is the day...

262
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,240
This is the day your dreams come true.

263
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,076
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

264
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,912
Plenty! Here. Picture this.

265
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,751
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fire

266
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,255
and my little wife massaging my feet

267
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,715
while the little ones play on the floor
with the dogs.

268
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,134
-We'll have six or seven.
-Dogs?

269
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,761
No, Belle.

270
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,597
-Strapping boys like me.
-Imagine that.

271
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,015
Do you know who that little wife will be?

272
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,059
-Let me think.
-You, Belle.

273
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:08,980
Gaston, I'm... I'm speechless.

274
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,440
I really don't know what to say.

275
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,902
-Say you'll marry me.
-I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

276
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,698
But I just don't deserve you!

277
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,381
So, how'd it go?

278
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,427
I'll have Belle for my wife.

279
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,305
Make no mistake about that.

280
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,182
Touchy.

281
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,900
Is he gone?

282
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,988
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.

283
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,909
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...

284
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,286
Madame Gaston

285
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,204
Can't youjust see it?

286
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,248
Madame Gaston

287
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,083
His little wife

288
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,670
No, sir, not me, l guarantee it

289
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:19,258
l want much more
than this provincial life

290
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:33,272
l want adventure
in the great wide somewhere

291
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,151
l want it more than l can tell

292
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,197
And for once it might be grand

293
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,909
To have someone understand

294
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:52,500
l want so much more
than they've got planned

295
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:59,340
Philippe! What are you doing here?
Where's... Where's Papa?

296
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,093
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?

297
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,304
We have to find him.
You have to take me to him.

298
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,695
What is this place?

299
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,198
Philippe, please, steady.

300
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,451
Steady.

301
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,331
Papa!

302
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,668
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

303
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,212
Just had to invite him to stay,
didn't we?

304
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:42,675
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
Pet the pooch.

305
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,427
I was trying to be hospitable.

306
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,013
Hello?

307
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,265
Is anyone here?

308
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,350
Hello?

309
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,604
Papa? Papa?

310
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,024
Are you here?

311
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,318
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.

312
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,405
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

313
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,615
Really, Mama. I saw her.

314
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,951
-Not another word. Into the tub.
-But... What?

315
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,121
A girl. I saw a girl in the castle.

316
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,373
See, I told you.

317
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,919
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy-eared, slack-jawed...

318
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,087
Papa?

319
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,382
Did you see that?

320
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,429
-It's a girl!
-I know it's a girl.

321
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,682
Don't you see? She's the one.
The girl we have been waiting for.

322
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,518
-She has come to break the spell.
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

323
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,234
Papa?

324
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,864
Hello? Is someone here?

325
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,242
Wait! I'm looking for my father. I...

326
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,540
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.

327
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,169
Is anyone here?

328
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,630
-Belle?
-Papa!

329
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,675
How did you find me?

330
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,595
Your hands are like ice.
We have to get you out of there.

331
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,680
Belle, I want you to leave this place.

332
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,848
Who's done this to you?

333
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,434
No time to explain. You must go. Now!

334
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,812
-I won't leave you.
-What are you doing here?

335
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,105
Run, Belle!

336
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,650
-Who's there? Who are you?
-The master of this castle.

337
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,361
I've come for my father.

338
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,696
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?

339
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,990
Then he shouldn't
have trespassed here!

340
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,701
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.

341
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,580
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.

342
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,958
There must be some way I can...

343
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:40,960
Wait!

344
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,926
-Take me instead.
-You?

345
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,764
You would take his place?

346
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,058
Belle, no!
You don't know what you're doing!

347
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,145
If I did, would you let him go?

348
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:03,774
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

349
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,987
Come into the light.

350
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,585
No, Belle! I won't let you do this!

351
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,673
-You have my word.
-Done.

352
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,181
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.

353
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,265
Wait.

354
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,391
-Belle!
-Wait.

355
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,687
No! Please spare my daughter. Please!

356
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:45,107
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.

357
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,943
Let me out. Please let me out!

358
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:52,198
Let me out! Please! Please!

359
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,538
-Master?
-What?

360
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,375
Since the girl is going to be with us
for quite some time,

361
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,172
I was thinking that you might want
to offer her a more comfortable room.

362
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,425
Then again, maybe not.

363
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,472
You didn't even let me say goodbye.

364
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,557
I'll never see him again.

365
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,227
I didn't get to say goodbye.

366
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,438
I'll show you to your room.

367
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,066
My room? But I thought...

368
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,485
You wanna...
You wanna stay in the tower?

369
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,903
-No.
-Then follow me.

370
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,260
Say something to her.

371
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,181
I hope you like it here.

372
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,893
The castle is your home now,

373
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,938
so you can go anywhere you like,
except the west wing.

374
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,649
-What's in the west...
-It's forbidden!

375
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,118
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.

376
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,412
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.

377
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,624
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!

378
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,103
Who does she think she is?

379
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,355
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

380
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,483
-No one says no to Gaston.
-Darn right.

381
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,863
Dismissed. Rejected.
Publicly humiliated.

382
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,906
Why, it's more than I can bear.

383
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:01,410
-More beer?
-What for? Nothing helps.

384
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,496
-I'm disgraced.
-Who, you? Never.

385
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,751
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

386
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,254
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston

387
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,424
Looking so down in the dumps

388
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,761
Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston

389
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,764
Even when taking your lumps

390
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,892
There's no man in town
as admired as you

391
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,479
You're everyone's favorite guy

392
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,815
Everyone's awed
and inspired by you

393
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,943
And it's not very hard

394
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,864
To see why

395
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:45,162
No one's slick as Gaston

396
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,747
No one's quick as Gaston

397
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,084
No one's neck's
as incredibly thick as Gaston

398
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,796
For there's no man in town
half as manly

399
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,590
Perfect, a pure paragon

400
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,927
You can ask any
Tom, Dick or StanIey

401
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:05,391
And they'll tell you
whose team theyprefer to be on

402
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:09,686
No one's been like Gaston

403
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,355
A kingpin Iike Gaston

404
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,650
No one's got a swell cleft
in his chin like Gaston

405
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,570
As a specimen, yes, l'm intimidating

406
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,615
My, what a guy, that Gaston

407
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,993
Give five hurrahs
Give 12 hip-hips

408
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:29,665
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips

409
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:34,837
No one fights like Gaston

410
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,505
Douses lights like Gaston

411
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,842
ln a wrestling match
nobody bites like Gaston

412
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:43,220
For there's no one
as burly and brawny

413
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,515
As you see, l've got biceps to spare

414
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,310
-Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
-That's right

415
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,355
And every last inch ofme's
covered with hair

416
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,567
-No one hits like Gaston
-Matches wits like Gaston

417
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:00,028
ln a spitting match
nobody spits like Gaston

418
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,907
l'm especially good at expectorating

419
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,035
Ten points for Gaston

420
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,038
When l was a lad
l ate four dozen eggs

421
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,625
Every morning to help me get large

422
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,712
And now that l'm grown
l eat five dozen eggs

423
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:22,801
So l'm roughly the size ofa barge

424
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:27,681
No one shoots like Gaston

425
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,391
Makes those beauts like Gaston

426
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,686
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston

427
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,732
l use antlers in all of my decorating

428
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,234
My, what a guy

429
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:45,282
Gaston

430
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:52,206
-Help! Someone help me!
-Maurice?

431
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,500
Please! Please, I need your help.

432
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,252
He's got her...
He's got her locked in the dungeon.

433
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,338
-Who?
-Belle. We must go.

434
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,215
Not... Not a minute to lose.

435
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,592
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.

436
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,470
-Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
-A beast!

437
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:09,181
A horrible, monstrous beast!

438
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:16,563
-Is it a big beast?
-Huge.

439
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,566
-With a long, ugly snout?
-Hideously ugly.

440
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,111
-And sharp, cruel fangs?
-Yes, yes! Will you help me?

441
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,948
All right, old man. We'll help you out.

442
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,785
You will?
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

443
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,373
Crazy old Maurice.

444
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,251
He's always good for a laugh.

445
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,629
Crazy old Maurice?

446
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,508
Crazy old Maurice.

447
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:49,179
LeFou, l'm afraid l've been thinking

448
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,847
A dangerous pastime

449
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,099
l Know

450
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,477
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father

451
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,647
And his sanity's only so-so

452
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,984
Now, the wheels in my head
have been turning

453
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,195
Since l looked at that loony old man

454
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,699
See, I promised myseif
l'd be married to Belle

455
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:13,328
And right now, l'm evolving a plan

456
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,497
-If I...
-Yes?

457
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,625
-Then we...
-No, would she?

458
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,335
-Guess.
-Now I get it!

459
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,671
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

460
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:26,758
No one plots like Gaston

461
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,468
Takes cheap shots like Gaston

462
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,847
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots
like Gaston

463
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:37,519
So, his marriage
we soon will be celebrating

464
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,105
My, what a guy

465
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:44,443
Gaston

466
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,282
Will no one help me?

467
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,251
-Who is it?
-Mrs. Potts, dear.

468
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,255
I thought you might like a spot of tea.

469
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,341
But you're... You're a...

470
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,386
-Careful.
-This is impossible.

471
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,056
I know it is, but here we are.

472
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,975
I told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't I?

473
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,355
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now. Don't spill.

474
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,232
Thank you.

475
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,318
Wanna see me do a trick?

476
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,739
-Chip!
-Sorry.

477
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,408
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

478
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,951
We all think so.

479
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:38,580
But I've lost my father,
my dreams, everything.

480
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:43,293
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.

481
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,961
You'll see.

482
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,672
Listen to me jabbering on

483
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,924
while there's a supper
to get on the table.

484
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,759
Chip?

485
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,177
Bye.

486
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,430
Well, now,
what shall we dress you in for dinner?

487
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,433
Let's see what I got in my drawers.

488
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,227
How embarrassing!

489
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:06,108
Here we are.
You'll look ravishing in this one.

490
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,569
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.

491
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,697
But you must.

492
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,369
Dinner is served.

493
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,498
What's taking so long?

494
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,333
I told her to come down.

495
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,920
-Why isn't she here yet?
-Try to be patient, sir.

496
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:30,298
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.

497
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,883
Master, have you thought

498
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,803
that perhaps this girl could be the one
to break the spell?

499
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,639
Of course I have! I'm not a fool.

500
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,475
Good! So, you fall in love with her,

501
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,187
she falls in love with you, and poof!
The spell is broken.

502
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,481
We'll be human again by midnight.

503
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,067
It's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.

504
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,820
But the rose has already begun to wilt.

505
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,739
It's no use.

506
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,241
She's so beautiful and I'm...

507
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,951
Well, look at me!

508
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,039
You must help her to see past all that.

509
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,875
I don't know how.

510
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,502
Well, you can start
by making yourself more presentable.

511
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,963
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.

512
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:13,967
Yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

513
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:16,344
Come, come, show me the smile.

514
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,390
-But don't frighten the poor girl.
-Impress her with your rapier wit.

515
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,641
But be gentle.

516
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,019
-Shower her with compliments.
-But be sincere.

517
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,520
And above all,

518
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,607
-you must control your temper!
-You must control your temper!

519
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,108
Here she is!

520
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,612
Good evening.

521
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,407
-Well, where is she?
-Who?

522
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,203
The girl, yes. The girl.

523
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:45,165
Well, actually, she's in the process of...

524
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:49,669
Circumstances being what they are...
She's not coming.

525
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,880
What?

526
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,050
Oh, dear. Your Grace! Your Eminence!

527
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,511
Let's not be hasty!

528
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,224
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!

529
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,850
I'm not hungry.

530
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,687
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!

531
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,606
Master, I could be wrong,

532
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,236
but that may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.

533
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,697
Please attempt to be a gentleman.

534
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,492
But she is being so difficult.

535
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,953
Gently, gently.

536
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,415
-Will you come down to dinner?
-No!

537
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,002
Suave, genteel.

538
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,047
It would give me great pleasure

539
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,925
if you would join me for dinner.

540
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,718
And we say "please."

541
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,595
-Please.
-No, thank you.

542
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,889
-You can't stay in there forever!
-Yes, I can.

543
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:47,477
Fine! Then go ahead and starve!

544
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:52,190
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all!

545
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,655
Oh, dear.
That didn't go very well at all, did it?

546
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,616
Lumiere, stand watch at the door

547
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,953
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.

548
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,539
You can count on me, mon capitaine.

549
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:11,835
Well, we might as well go downstairs
and start cleaning up.

550
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,505
I ask nicely, but she refuses.

551
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,592
What does she want me to do, beg?

552
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,469
Show me the girl.

553
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:27,267
But the master's really not so bad,
once you get to know him.

554
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,352
Why don't you give him a chance?

555
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,229
l don't want to get to know him.

556
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,232
l don't want to have anything
to do with him.

557
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,986
I'm just fooling myself.

558
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,947
She'll never see me as anything

559
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,532
but a monster.

560
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,289
It's hopeless.

561
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,017
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

562
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,770
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes, yes, yes.

563
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:14,314
I've been burned by you before.

564
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,569
Zut alors! She has emerged!

565
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:28,119
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

566
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,872
But I'm not sleepy.

567
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,042
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

568
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:37,671
I work and I slave all day long,
and for what?

569
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,674
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!

570
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,760
Stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.

571
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,013
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

572
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,682
After all, he did say "please."

573
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,518
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper,

574
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,853
-he'll never break the...
-Splendid to see you

575
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,563
out and about, mademoiselle.

576
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,316
I am Cogsworth, head of the household.

577
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,738
-This is Lumiere.
-Enchante cherie.

578
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,033
If there's, stop that,
anything we, please,

579
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,286
can do to make your stay
more comfortable...

580
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,706
-I am a little hungry.
-You are?

581
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,541
Hear that? She's hungry.

582
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,711
Stoke the fire.
Break out the silver. Wake the china.

583
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,422
Remember what the master said.

584
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,550
Pish tosh. I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.

585
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,553
All right, fine. Glass of water,
crust of bread and then...

586
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,513
Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.

587
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,933
She's not a prisoner. She's our guest.

588
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,603
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiselle.

589
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,522
Well, keep it down.

590
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,025
If the master finds out about this,
it will be our necks.

591
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,943
Of course, of course.

592
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,030
But what is dinner
without a little music?

593
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,865
Music?

594
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,289
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

595
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,207
that we welcome you tonight.

596
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,918
And now, we invite you to relax.

597
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,840
Let us pull up a chair,
as the dining room proudly presents

598
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,341
your dinner.

599
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:11,639
Be ourguest, be ourguest

600
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,933
Put ourservice to the test

601
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,603
Tie your napkin
'round yourneck, cherie

602
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,605
And we provide the rest

603
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,899
Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres

604
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,151
Why, we only live to serve

605
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,487
Try the gray stuff, it's delicious

606
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,822
Don't believe me?
Ask the dishes

607
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,075
They can sing, they can dance

608
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,577
After all, miss, this is France

609
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:36,498
And a dinner here
is neversecond best

610
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,042
Go on, unfoId your menu

611
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,253
Take a glance
and then you'll be ourguest

612
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,507
Oui, ourguest
Be ourguest

613
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,884
Beefragout, cheese souffle

614
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,011
Pie and pudding, en flambe

615
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,930
We'll prepare and serve with flair

616
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,182
A culinary cabaret

617
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,518
You're alone and you're scared

618
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,603
But the banquet's all prepared

619
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,730
No one's gloomy or complaining

620
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,941
While the flatware's entertaining

621
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,943
We tell jokes, l do tricks

622
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,195
With my fellow candlesticks

623
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,030
Und it's all in perfect taste

624
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,199
That you can bet

625
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,368
Come on and Iift your gIass

626
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,453
You've won your own free pass

627
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,621
To be ourguest

628
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,999
If you're stressed
it's fine dining we suggest

629
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,168
Be ourguest, be ourguest

630
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,087
Be ourguest

631
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,049
Life is so unnerving

632
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,593
For a servant who's not serving

633
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,888
He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon

634
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,515
Get off!

635
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,600
Those good old days

636
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,435
When we were useful

637
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:44,315
Suddenly, those good old days
are gone

638
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,235
Ten years we've been rusting

639
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,904
Needing so much more than dusting

640
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,364
Needing exercise

641
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:54,659
A chance to use ourskills

642
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,747
Most days
wejust lay around the castle

643
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,457
Flabby, fat and lazy

644
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,459
You walked in and oops-a-daisy

645
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,378
lt's a guest, it's a guest

646
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:07,130
Sakes alive, well, l'll be blessed

647
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,923
Wine's been poured
and thank the Lord

648
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,967
l've had the napkins freshlypressed

649
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,969
With dessert, she'll want tea

650
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,971
And, my dear, that's fine with me

651
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,806
While the cups do theirsoft-shoeing

652
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,850
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing

653
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,727
I'll getwarm, piping hot

654
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,729
Heaven sakes, is that a spot?

655
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,107
Clean it up
We want the company impressed

656
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,318
We've got a lot to do

657
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,236
Is it one lump or two?

658
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,529
For you, our guest

659
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,406
-She's ourguest
-She's ourguest

660
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,741
Be ourguest

661
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,492
Be ourguest, be ourguest
Our command is your request

662
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,952
Let's go, people. Fun's over.
Over here. Line up.

663
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,788
lt's 10 years
since we've had anybody here

664
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:41,956
And we're obsessed

665
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,833
With yourmeal, with your ease

666
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,877
Yes, indeed, we aim to please

667
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,463
While the candlelight's still glowing

668
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:53,092
Let us help you, we'll keep going

669
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:57,388
Course by course

670
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,641
One by one

671
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,393
Till you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"

672
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:06,231
Then we'll sing you offto sleep
as you digest

673
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,316
Tonight, you'll prop your feet up

674
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,151
But fornow, let's eat up

675
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:15,073
Be ourguest

676
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:18,701
Please be our

677
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:24,540
Guest

678
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,672
-Bravo! That was wonderful.
-Thank you.

679
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:36,094
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!

680
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:41,516
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.

681
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,018
I couldn't possibly go to bed now.

682
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,020
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.

683
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,438
Enchanted!

684
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:51,526
Who said anything
about the castle being enchanted?

685
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,194
It was you, wasn't it?

686
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,405
I figured it out for myself.

687
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,617
I'd like to look around, if that's all right.

688
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,829
-Would you like a tour?
-Wait a second. Wait a second.

689
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,373
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

690
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:09,168
We can't let her go poking around
in certain places,

691
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,712
if you know what I mean.

692
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,213
Perhaps you'd like to take me.

693
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,717
I'm sure you know everything there is
to know about the castle.

694
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,678
Well. Actually, I...

695
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,096
Yes, I do.

696
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,851
As you can see,
the pseudo-facade was stripped away

697
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,395
to reveal the minimalist Rococo design.

698
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,189
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

699
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,901
This is yet another example
of the late-neoclassic Baroque period.

700
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,530
And, as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.

701
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,617
Where was I?

702
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,953
As you were!

703
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:49,417
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses above the...

704
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,501
Mademoiselle?

705
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,052
-What's up there?
-Where? There? Nothing.

706
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,220
Absolutely nothing of interest at all
in the west wing.

707
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,306
Dusty, dull, very boring.

708
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,768
So, that's the west wing!

709
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,227
Nice going.

710
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,439
I wonder what he's hiding up there.

711
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:15,443
-Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
-Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

712
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:19,947
Perhaps mademoiselle would like
to see something else?

713
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,617
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

714
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,869
-Maybe later.
-The gardens.

715
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,121
Or... Or the... The library, perhaps?

716
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,082
You have a library?

717
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,209
-Yes. Indeed.
-With books.

718
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,753
-Scads of books.
-Mountains of books.

719
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,254
-Forests of books.
-Cascades.

720
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,881
-Cloudbursts.
-Swamps of books.

721
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,634
More books than you'll ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

722
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,803
Books on every subject ever studied

723
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,680
by every author
who ever set pen to paper.

724
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:28,075
-Why did you come here?
-I'm... I'm sorry.

725
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,871
-I warned you never to come here!
-I didn't mean any harm.

726
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,665
Do you realize
what you could have done?

727
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:36,918
Please! Stop!

728
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,170
-Get out!
-No!

729
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,425
Get out!

730
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:56,938
Where are you going?

731
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,316
Promise or no promise,
I can't stay here another minute.

732
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,027
No, wait, please! Please, wait!

733
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,146
No!

734
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,426
Here, now. Don't do that.

735
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,307
Just hold still.

736
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,185
That hurts!

737
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,187
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

738
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,439
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.

739
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,984
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.

740
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,071
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing!

741
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,157
Well, you should learn
to control your temper.

742
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,913
Now, hold still. This might sting a little.

743
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:08,379
By the way,
thank you for saving my life.

744
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,552
You're welcome.

745
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,896
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night,

746
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,733
but he said
you'd make it worth my while.

747
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,863
-I'm listening.
-It's like this.

748
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,241
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle,

749
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,161
but she needs a little persuasion.

750
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,830
Turned him down flat.

751
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,875
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.

752
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:49,336
He was in here tonight
raving about a beast in a castle.

753
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,088
Maurice is harmless.

754
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:56,427
The point is, Belle would do anything
to keep him from being locked up.

755
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,889
Yeah, even marry him.

756
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,186
So, you want me to throw her father
into the asylum,

757
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,605
unless she agrees to marry you.

758
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,775
That is despicable.

759
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,444
I love it.

760
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:19,116
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone.

761
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,244
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes.

762
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,830
I'll find that castle and somehow, I...

763
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,957
I'll get her out of there.

764
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,299
-Belle! Maurice!
-Oh, well.

765
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,427
Guess it's not gonna work, after all.

766
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,763
They have to come back sometime.

767
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,600
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

768
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:50,898
LeFou, don't move from that spot
until Belle and her father come home.

769
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,525
But... But I...

770
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,320
Nuts.

771
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,720
I've never felt this way about anyone.

772
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:27,434
I want to do something for her.
But what?

773
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,353
Well, there's the usual things.

774
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,940
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.

775
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,111
No, no.
It has to be something very special.

776
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:40,406
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute.

777
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,201
Belle?

778
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,538
There's something I want to show you.

779
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,834
But first, you have to close your eyes.

780
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,588
It's a surprise.

781
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,767
-Can I open them?
-No, no. Not yet.

782
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,687
Wait here.

783
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:21,071
-Now can I open them?
-All right. Now.

784
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,832
I can't believe it.

785
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,376
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.

786
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,755
-You... You like it?
-It's wonderful.

787
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,423
Then it's yours.

788
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,092
Thank you so much.

789
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,220
-Would you look at that!
-I knew it would work.

790
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,556
What? What works?

791
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:51,060
-It's very encouraging.
-Isn't this exciting?

792
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,437
-I didn't see anything.
-Come along, Chip.

793
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,272
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

794
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,943
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.

795
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:49,743
There's something sweet
and almost kind

796
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:53,539
But he was mean
and he was coarse and unrefined

797
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:57,334
And now he's dear and so unsure

798
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:01,130
I wonder why
l didn't see it there before

799
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,603
She glanced this way

800
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,439
l thought l saw

801
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:22,276
And when we touched
she didn't shudder at my paw

802
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,153
No, it can't be

803
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,030
I'll just ignore

804
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:30,200
But then she's neverlooked at me
that way before

805
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:38,459
New and a bit alarming

806
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,378
Who'd have ever thought

807
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:47,968
That this could be

808
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,387
True

809
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:54,266
That he's no Prince Charming

810
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,643
But there's something in him

811
00:55:56,728 --> 00:56:01,398
That l simply didn't see

812
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,485
-Well, who'd have thought
-Well, bless my soul

813
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,487
-Well, who'd have known
-Well, who, indeed

814
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,239
And who'd have guessed
they'd come together on their own

815
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,867
-lt's so peculiar. Wait and see
-We'll wait and see

816
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,660
A few days more

817
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:17,039
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

818
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:23,337
You know, perhaps there is something
there that wasn't there before

819
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,255
What?

820
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,093
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

821
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,928
What's there, Mama?

822
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,431
I'll tell you when you're older.

823
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,477
Right, then,
you all know why we're here.

824
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,605
We have exactly 1 2 hours,
36 minutes and 1 5 seconds

825
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:45,192
to create the most magical,
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere

826
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,152
known to man or beast.

827
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,661
Right. Need I remind you

828
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:59,248
that if the last petal falls from this rose

829
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,625
the spell will never be broken?

830
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,004
Very well.
You all know your assignments.

831
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,341
Half of you to the west wing,
half of you to the east wing,

832
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,635
the rest of you, come with me.

833
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,935
Lighten up, Cogsworth,
and let nature take its course.

834
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,437
It's obvious there's a spark
between them.

835
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:26,400
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames, you know, a little.

836
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:32,114
Besides, they must fall in love tonight
if we ever expect to be human again.

837
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,324
-Human again.
-Human again.

838
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,494
Yes, think what that means.

839
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,041
l'll be cooking again

840
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,043
Be good-looking again

841
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:48,380
With a mademoiselle on each arm

842
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,841
When l'm human again

843
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,718
Only human again

844
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:56,597
Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm

845
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,432
I'll be courting again

846
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,434
Chic and sporting again

847
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:04,188
Which should cause
several husbands alarm

848
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,939
I'll hop down off this shelf

849
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,566
and, tout de suite, be myself

850
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,111
l can't wait to be human again

851
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,907
When we're human again

852
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,617
Only human again

853
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:20,245
When we're knickknacks
and what-nots no more

854
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,997
When we're human again

855
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,707
Good and human again

856
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:27,419
Oh, cheri, won't it all be top-drawer?

857
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:29,338
I'll wear lipstick and rouge

858
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,006
And l won't be so huge

859
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,468
Why, l'll easily fit through that door

860
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,470
l'll exude savoir-faire

861
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,305
I'll wear gowns, I'll have hair

862
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,892
It's my prayer to be human again

863
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,482
When we're human again

864
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,150
Only human again

865
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:53,528
When the world once more
starts making sense

866
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,239
I'll unwind for a change

867
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,907
Really? That would be strange

868
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,868
Can l help it ifl'm tense?

869
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,162
ln a shack by the sea

870
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,747
l'll sit back sipping tea

871
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:07,125
Let my early retirement commence

872
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,002
Far from fools made ofwax

873
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,797
l'll get down to brass tacks and relax

874
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:15,842
When l'm human again

875
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:19,388
So, sweep that dust from the floor

876
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:22,516
Let's let some light in the room

877
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,184
l can feel, l can tell

878
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,978
Someone might break the spell

879
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,815
Any day now

880
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,776
Shine up the brass on the door

881
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,988
Alert the dustbin and broom

882
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,656
If it all goes as planned

883
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,408
Our time may be at hand

884
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:42,995
Any day now

885
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:46,915
Open the shutters
and let in some air

886
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,669
Put these here
and put those over there

887
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:54,089
Sweep up the years
ofsadness and tears

888
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:58,802
And throw them away

889
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,059
We'll be human again

890
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,769
Only human again

891
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:11,189
When the girl finally sets us all free

892
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,899
Cheeks a-blooming again

893
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,651
We're assuming again

894
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:18,071
We'll resume our long lost
joie de vivre

895
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,740
We'll be playing again

896
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,575
Holidaying again

897
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:25,078
And we're praying it's ASAP

898
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,747
We will push, we will shove

899
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,498
They will both fall in love

900
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:32,753
And we'll finally be human again

901
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:37,257
"For never was a story of more woe

902
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,843
"Than this of Juliet and her Romeo"

903
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:46,433
-Could you read it again?
-Here, why don't you read it to me?

904
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:47,851
All right.

905
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,150
-I can't.
-You mean, you never learned?

906
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,694
I learned. A little.

907
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,114
It's just been so long.

908
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,408
Well, here, I'll help you.

909
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,827
-Let's start here.
-Here.

910
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,332
-Okay. "Twoh..."
-"Two."

911
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:14,169
"Two." I knew that. "Two households..."

912
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:19,633
We'll be dancing again

913
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,468
We'll be twirling again

914
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:24,846
We'll be whirling around
with such ease

915
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,473
When we're human again

916
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,183
Only human again

917
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:31,645
We'll go waltzing
those old one-two-threes

918
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,146
We'll be floating again

919
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,981
We'll be gliding again

920
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:38,485
Stepping, striding
as fine as you please

921
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:41,905
Like a real human does

922
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:45,367
l'll be all that l was

923
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:49,538
On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn

924
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:53,667
And we're all of us human

925
01:01:53,751 --> 01:02:00,590
Again

926
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:13,520
Tonight is the night.

927
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,109
-I'm not sure I can do this.
-You don't have time to be timid.

928
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:21,445
You must be bold, daring.

929
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:22,988
Bold. Daring.

930
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:30,871
There will be music,
romantic candlelight

931
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:32,664
provided by myself.

932
01:02:32,748 --> 01:02:36,042
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.

933
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,712
Yes, I...

934
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:40,881
I... I... No, I can't.

935
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:44,593
-You care for the girl, don't you?
-More than anything.

936
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,845
Well, then, you must tell her.

937
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,892
Voila! You look so, so...

938
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:53,894
Stupid.

939
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,730
Not quite the word I was looking for.

940
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:59,274
Perhaps a little more off the top.

941
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,489
Your lady awaits.

942
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,891
Tale as old as time

943
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,979
True as it can be

944
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,401
Barely even friends

945
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,112
Then somebody bends

946
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,114
Unexpectedly

947
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,411
Just a little change

948
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:58,708
Small to say the least

949
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,545
Both a little scared

950
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,047
Neither one prepared

951
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:07,050
Beauty and the Beast

952
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,597
Ever just the same

953
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:18,562
Ever a surprise

954
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,524
Ever as before

955
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:24,818
Ever just as sure

956
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:28,488
As the sun will rise

957
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:32,909
Tale as old as time

958
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,747
Tune as old as song

959
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:42,544
Bittersweet and strange

960
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:44,921
Finding you can change

961
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,841
Learning you were wrong

962
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,346
Certain as the sun

963
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:57,601
Rising in the east

964
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,103
Tale as old as time

965
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:03,231
Song as old as rhyme

966
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,984
Beauty and the Beast

967
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:12,240
Tale as old as time

968
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:16,620
Song as old as rhyme

969
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:23,251
Beauty and the Beast

970
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:28,089
Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.

971
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:32,010
Good night, love.

972
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,202
Belle?

973
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,499
Are you happy here with me?

974
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,167
Yes.

975
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,423
What is it?

976
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:15,637
If only I could see my father again,
just for a moment.

977
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:17,430
I miss him so much.

978
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,354
There is a way.

979
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,984
This mirror will show you anything.

980
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,070
Anything you wish to see.

981
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,448
I'd like to see my father, please.

982
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,208
Papa. Oh, no.

983
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:49,796
He's sick. He may be dying,
and he's all alone.

984
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,222
Then you must go to him.

985
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,307
What did you say?

986
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:04,853
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.

987
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:08,773
-You mean I'm free?
-Yes.

988
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:14,404
Thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.

989
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,117
Take it with you

990
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:23,079
so you'll always have a way
to look back and remember me.

991
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,587
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

992
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:43,725
Well, Your Highness, I must say
everything is going just swimmingly.

993
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:46,686
I knew you had it in you.

994
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,855
I let her go.

995
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,940
Yes, yes...

996
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:54,068
You what?

997
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:57,197
-How could you do that?
-I had to.

998
01:07:57,281 --> 01:08:00,074
Yes, but... But why?

999
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:03,328
Because I love her.

1000
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,622
He did what?

1001
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:09,876
-Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
-She's going away?

1002
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,003
But he was so close.

1003
01:08:12,087 --> 01:08:16,549
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.

1004
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,177
That's it then.
That should break the spell.

1005
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:23,139
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.

1006
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,725
Now it's too late.

1007
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:38,279
Papa?

1008
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,087
They're back.

1009
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:57,715
Belle.

1010
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,511
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.

1011
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,682
I thought I'd never see you again.

1012
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:09,143
-I missed you so much!
-But the Beast...

1013
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,896
-Did you... How did you escape?
-I didn't escape, Papa.

1014
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:15,275
-He... He let me go.
-That horrible beast?

1015
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,779
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.

1016
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:28,371
-Hi!
-A stowaway.

1017
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:31,332
Why, hello there, little fella.

1018
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:34,043
Didn't think I'd see you again.

1019
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,713
Belle, why'd you go away?

1020
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:39,215
Don't you like us anymore?

1021
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,176
Chip, of course I do. It's just that...

1022
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:49,225
-May I help you?
-I've come to collect your father.

1023
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,145
-My father?
-Don't worry, mademoiselle.

1024
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:54,731
We'll take good care of him.

1025
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:59,110
-My father's not crazy!
-He was raving like a lunatic!

1026
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:02,405
-We all heard him, didn't we?
-Yes!

1027
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,950
-No, I won't let you!
-Belle?

1028
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:09,370
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

1029
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:12,123
Just how big was the beast?

1030
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:16,085
He was... I mean, he was...
He was enormous!

1031
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:20,465
I'd... I'd say at least eight,
no, more like 1 0 feet!

1032
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:25,094
Well, you don't get much crazier
than that.

1033
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:27,847
It's true, I tell you.

1034
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,351
-Get him out of here!
-Let go of me!

1035
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:33,645
No! You can't do this!

1036
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,274
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.

1037
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,902
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

1038
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:45,865
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding if...

1039
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:48,785
-If what?
-If you marry me.

1040
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:51,120
-What?
-One little word, Belle.

1041
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,122
-That's all it takes.
-Never!

1042
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,540
Have it your way.

1043
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:57,877
Belle? Let go of me!

1044
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,297
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it.

1045
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,049
Show me the Beast.

1046
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:11,391
-Is it dangerous?
-No, no, he'd never hurt anyone.

1047
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:15,520
Please, I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.

1048
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,648
-He's my friend.
-If I didn't know better,

1049
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:21,734
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

1050
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,612
He's no monster, Gaston. You are!

1051
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,116
She's as crazy as the old man.

1052
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,827
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1053
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:32,412
-He'll come after them in the night.
-No.

1054
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:35,373
We're not safe till his head
is mounted on my wall!

1055
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,417
I say we kill the Beast!

1056
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:40,002
We're not safe until he's dead

1057
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:41,796
He'll come stalking us at night

1058
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,506
Set to sacrifice our children

1059
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,341
To his monstrous appetite

1060
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,093
He'll wreak havoc on our village

1061
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:49,011
If we let him wander free

1062
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:52,765
So, it's time to take some action, boys

1063
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:59,105
lt's time to follow me

1064
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,650
Through the mist, through the woods
through the darkness and the shadows

1065
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,862
lt's a nightmare
but it's one exciting ride

1066
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:09,157
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge ofa castle

1067
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:12,368
And there's something
truly terrible inside

1068
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:15,621
lt's a beast
He's got fangs, razor-sharp ones

1069
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:19,000
Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast

1070
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,668
Hearhim roar, see him foam

1071
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,295
But we're not coming home

1072
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:26,549
Till he's dead, good and dead
Kill the Beast!

1073
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:28,050
No, I won't let you do this.

1074
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:31,971
If you're not with us, you're against us.
Bring the old man!

1075
01:12:32,055 --> 01:12:33,723
Get your hands off me!

1076
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:36,350
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1077
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:39,937
-Let us out!
-We'll rid the village of this beast!

1078
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,190
-Who's with me?
-I am!

1079
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:43,566
-I am!
-I am!

1080
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,109
Light your torch, mount your horse

1081
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,944
Screw your courage
to the sticking place

1082
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,906
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way

1083
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:53,075
Through a mist, to a wood
where within a haunted castle

1084
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,370
Something's Iurking
that you don't see every day

1085
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:59,665
lt's a beast
One as tall as a mountain

1086
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,919
We won't rest
till he's good and deceased

1087
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:04,587
Sally forth, tally-ho

1088
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:06,255
Grab your sword and your bow

1089
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,882
Praise the Lord and here we go

1090
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:11,511
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

1091
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:15,473
I have to warn the Beast.
This is all my fault.

1092
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:20,102
-Papa, what are we going to do?
-Now, now. We'll think of something.

1093
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,112
We don't like
what we don't understand

1094
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:31,239
ln fact, it scares us

1095
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:34,450
And this monster
is mysterious at least

1096
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,244
Bring your guns, bring your Knives

1097
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:37,620
Save your chiIdren and your wives

1098
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:40,957
We'll save our village and ourlives

1099
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:42,124
We'll kill the Beast

1100
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:46,295
I knew it. I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1101
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,007
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1102
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,468
-Could it be...
-Is it she?

1103
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,846
Sacrebleu! Invaders!

1104
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,139
-Encroachers.
-And they have the mirror.

1105
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,266
Warn the master.

1106
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,434
If it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.

1107
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:02,353
Who's with me?

1108
01:14:02,437 --> 01:14:04,438
Take whatever booty you can find.

1109
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,149
But remember, the Beast is mine!

1110
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:09,151
Hearts ablaze, banners high

1111
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,736
We go marching into battle

1112
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:13,739
Unafraid, although the danger
just increased

1113
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:15,575
Raise the flag, sing the song

1114
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:17,034
Here we come, we're 50 strong

1115
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,288
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong

1116
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:22,123
Let's kill the Beast

1117
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:25,501
-Pardon me, Master.
-Leave me in peace.

1118
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:28,004
But, sir, the castle is under attack.

1119
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:31,173
Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!

1120
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:36,012
-This isn't working.
-Lumiere, we must do something!

1121
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:37,638
Wait! I know!

1122
01:14:38,473 --> 01:14:41,142
Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!

1123
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:44,312
What shall we do, Master?

1124
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:46,522
It doesn't matter now.

1125
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,024
Just let them come.

1126
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:51,319
Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!

1127
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:53,195
Kill the Beast!

1128
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:06,667
Now!

1129
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:28,648
Yes!

1130
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,153
Here we go!

1131
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:39,158
What the devil?

1132
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,744
Belle, look out!

1133
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,169
You guys gotta try this thing.

1134
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,718
Up here, you scurvy scum.

1135
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,679
Now!

1136
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,333
And stay out.

1137
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:46,035
Get up.

1138
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,621
What's the matter, Beast?

1139
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,958
Too kind and gentle to fight back?

1140
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,592
No!

1141
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:07,640
-Belle.
-No, Gaston, don't.

1142
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:15,356
Let's go, Philippe.

1143
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:42,341
Come on out and fight!

1144
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:47,513
Were you in love with her, Beast?

1145
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:50,099
Did you honestly think she'd want you

1146
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:52,434
when she had someone like me?

1147
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:08,284
It's over, Beast! Belle is mine!

1148
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,792
Let me go. Let me go.
Please, don't hurt me.

1149
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,961
I'll do anything. Anything!

1150
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,393
Get out.

1151
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:37,146
Beast!

1152
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:39,398
Belle.

1153
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:49,575
Belle?

1154
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,790
You came back.

1155
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:37,289
You...

1156
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:40,376
You came back.

1157
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:43,921
Of course I came back.
I couldn't let them...

1158
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,590
This is all my fault.

1159
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,467
If only I'd gotten here sooner.

1160
01:20:48,551 --> 01:20:53,180
Maybe it's better... It's better this way.

1161
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,683
Don't talk like that.

1162
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,060
You'll be all right.

1163
01:20:58,144 --> 01:21:01,981
We're together now.
Everything's going to be fine, you'll see.

1164
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:07,444
At least I got to see you

1165
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:10,739
one last time.

1166
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,502
No. No.

1167
01:21:24,504 --> 01:21:28,507
Please. Please. Please don't leave me.

1168
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:33,846
I love you.

1169
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:15,239
Belle, it's me.

1170
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:32,548
It is you.

1171
01:24:05,915 --> 01:24:07,166
Lumiere.

1172
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:09,376
Cogsworth.

1173
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,254
Mrs. Potts!

1174
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:15,674
-Look at us.
-Mama. Mama.

1175
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:24,016
-Oh, my goodness.
-It is a miracle.

1176
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:36,111
L'amour.

1177
01:24:40,366 --> 01:24:43,869
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?

1178
01:24:43,953 --> 01:24:46,788
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would break the spell.

1179
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:51,460
I beg your pardon, old friend,
but I believe I told you.

1180
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:53,337
No, you didn't. I told you.

1181
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,214
You most certainly did not,

1182
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:57,341
you pompous,
paraffin-headed pea-brain!

1183
01:24:57,425 --> 01:25:00,552
En garde, you overgrown pocket watch!

1184
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,638
-Take that.
-Stop shoving.

1185
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:09,228
Are they gonna live
happily ever after, Mama?

1186
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:11,063
Of course, my dear.

1187
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,232
Of course.

1188
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:16,902
Do I still have to sleep in the cupboard?

1189
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:24,034
Certain as the sun

1190
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,871
Rising in the east

1191
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,332
Tale as old as time

1192
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:33,085
Song as old as rhyme

1193
01:25:33,169 --> 01:25:39,007
Beauty and the Beast

1194
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:41,969
Tale as old as time

1195
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:45,556
Song as old as rhyme

1196
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:51,353
Beauty and the Beast

1197
01:25:52,305 --> 01:26:52,657
