BARTENDER: Last orders, please.

3
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,980
- LIZ: Shaun.
- Yeah?

4
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,730
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, totally.

5
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,690
I know he's your best friend,
but you do live with him.

6
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,150
I know.

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,410
It's not that I don't like Ed.
Ed, it's not that I don't like you.

8
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,070
It's all right.

9
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,490
- It'd just be nice if we could...
- Fuck.

10
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,210
- ... spend a bit more time together.
- Bollocks.

11
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,330
- Just the two of us.
- Cock it.

12
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,210
It's just with Ed here, it's no wonder
I always bring my flatmates out,

13
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
and then that only exacerbates things.

14
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,640
- What do you mean?
- Well, you guys hardly get on, do you?

15
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,100
- No, what does "exacerbate" mean?
- It means to make things worse.

16
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,680
Right, right.

17
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,810
Well, I mean, it's not that
I don't like David and Di, you know.

18
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,400
- Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
- BOTH: It's all right.

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,940
And it's not that I don't want to spend time
with you, 'cause I do.

20
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,030
It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends.

21
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,530
Can I get any of you cunts a drink?

22
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,710
- Anybody?
- BOTH: No, thank you.

23
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,800
I know friends are important to Shaun,

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,090
but you do actually have to set some
quality time aside for yourselves.

25
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,010
Yeah, I mean Daffs is always taking me
to see these listed buildings,

26
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,760
and, you know,
I'm always dragging him to the theater.

27
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,010
I'm not so hot on theater.

28
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,730
DIANNE: Well, how about a nice meal?
It's your anniversary soon, isn't it?

29
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,440
- It was last week.
- Oh. Did you do anything special?

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,900
- We came here.
- ED: Shaun. Hog lumps.

31
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,820
Shaun, what I'm trying to say is
I need something more,

32
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,030
more than spending every night
in the Winchester.

33
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,530
I want to get out there
and do more interesting stuff.

34
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,620
I want to live a little.
I want you to want to want to do it, too.

35
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,670
Listen to me.
I'm beginning to sound like your mum.

36
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,170
Not that I'd know what she sounds like.

37
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,090
- You still haven't met his mum?
- Not yet.

38
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,710
Don't you get along with your mum, Shaun?

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,470
No. It's not that I don't get on with her...

40
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,510
- Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?
- No, I love my mum.

41
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,260
- I love his mum.
- SHAUN: Ed!

42
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,430
- She's like butter.
- Ed!

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
- BOTH: Shaun!
- Guys.

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,770
- Shaun.
- Liz.

45
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,350
Look, I understand what you're trying
to say, okay, and I agree.

46
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,190
We should get out there.
We'll start tomorrow.

47
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,730
All right, I'll book a restaurant, you know,
the place that does all the fish.

48
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,110
Just the two of us.
Things will change, I promise.

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,620
Really, Shaun?

50
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,830

was open again last night.

57
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,640
- I'm not saying it was you.
- I know, man.

58
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,890
- I'm saying it was Ed.
- Right.

59
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,850
I can't live like this.

60
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,640
I mean, just look at the state of it.

61
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,730
- We're not students anymore.
- Pete, just...

62
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,980
I mean, it's not like he even brings
any real money into the house.

63
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,900
- Well, he brings a bit.
- What, dealing drugs?

64
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,650
Oh, he sells a bit of weed
every now and again, you know.

65
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,910
You've sold puff.

66
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,780
Yeah, once. At college. To you.

67
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,700
Well, look, I've known him
since primary school, you know.

68
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,410
I like having him around, he's a laugh.

69
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,830
What, because he can impersonate
an orangutan? Fuck-a-doodle-doo.

70
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,250
Oh, leave him alone.

71
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,960
All right, I admit
he can be pretty funny on occasion.

72
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,090
Like that time we stayed up all night
drinking Apple Schnapps

73
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,220
and playing Tekken 2.

74
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,590
Oh, yeah.

75
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,350
When was that?

76
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,600
That was five years ago.
When's he going home?

77
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,770
Hey, man, listen... Top left.

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,960

87
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,590
- could you please clean up a bit?
- ED: Yep.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,800
And if you play the answer machine,

89
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,350
could you take down everyone's messages,
not just your own?

90
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,640
Yep.

91
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,560
It's not that taxing, is it?

92
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,020
Writing something on a little scrap
of paper?

93
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,100
- Nope.
- Right.

94
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,490

- Come on, it was pretty funny.

95
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,660
- Will you do what he said though?
- I ain't doing nothing for him.

96
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,700
Well, do it for me, then.

97
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,750
I'm sorry, Shaun.

98

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,440
Shaun.

153
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,440
I trust you haven't forgotten
about tomorrow.

154
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,320
- No.
- Your bi-monthly visit.

155
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,650
No, I haven't forgotten.

156
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,320
Perhaps you could bring the flowers you
forgot to bring Barbara on Mother's Day.

157
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,450
I was gonna.

158
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,580
And not a cheap posy
from a garage forecourt.

159
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,250
I wasn't gonna.

160
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,170
Well, we look forward to seeing you
tomorrow, then.

161
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,800
- Okay.
- You've got red on you.

162
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,680
I thought you said
this wasn't a social gathering?

163
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,890
What?

164
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,190
How comes you're allowed to speak
to your dad?

165
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,730
A, he's not my dad, okay? He's my stepdad.

166
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,860
And B, it was an emergency.

167
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,700
What, like buying your mum some flowers?

168
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,530
Noel, no matter what you might think, okay,

169
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,030
I do not find it difficult to keep my work
and my social life separate.

170
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,410
MAN: Shaun. It's Liz for you.

171

173
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,550
Yep.

Yeah.

<i>Oh, cool, well, that's great.
Just ring me later.</i>

178

<i>- Goodbye, Liz.
- Bye. Bye, bye, bye.</i>

179
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,310
Liz from Head Office.
It's nothing to panic about.

180
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,690
Sir? Sir?

181
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,450
Sorry. They're for my mum.

182
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,280
"To a wonderful mum"
or "Pow! Super Mum"?

183
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,750
- The first one.
- Right.

184
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,420
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus!

185
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,380
- Shaun!
- Yvonne.

186
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,630
- How are you doing?
- Surviving.

187
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,130
So, are you living round here?

188
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,300
- Um, yeah, are you?
- Yeah, I've just bought a place, actually.

189
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,470
- Bought?
- I know, bit grown up, eh?

190
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,720
- Are you still with...
- Liz.

191
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,390
That's great. Glad somebody made it.

192
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,150
How long's that been now?

193
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,110
It's three years ago last week, actually.

194
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,570
Did you do anything special?

195
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,650
Well, we're going out for a meal tonight,
actually.

196
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,400
Oh, anywhere nice?

197
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,240
Yeah.

198
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,830
Come on!

199
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,710
- Are you gonna thank me, then?
- For what?

200
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,170
Tidying up.

201
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,590
- Well, it doesn't look that tidy.
- Well, I had a few beers when I finished.

202
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,180
<i>MAN ON PHONE: Hello, Fulci's.
Can you hold, please?</i>

203
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,380
Yeah.

204
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,850
- Do you want your messages?
- What?

205
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,470
Well, your mum rang about going round
tomorrow night.

206
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,480
And then Liz rang about the two of you
eating out tonight.

207
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,270
And then your mum rang back to see
if I wanted to eat her out tonight.

<i>- What?
- Hello, Fulci's.</i>

Yeah, hi.

210
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,280
I know this is really short notice
and everything,

211
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,860
but could you possibly do me a table
for two for tonight at about 8:00?

212
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,530
<i>No, sorry, we just gave away the last table.</i>

213

God!

214
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,370
Wasn't true about your mum.

215
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,460
What am I gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

216
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,380
- The Winchester.
- Don't be stupid! They don't do food.

217
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,050
There's a Breville out back.
John'll do you a toastie.

218
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,380

- So, what's the plan, then?</i>

221
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,100
Yeah, there's been a bit of a mix-up
with the table, babe.

222
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,350
<i>What do you mean?</i>

223
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,140
They're... They're full up.

224
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,860
<i>But I thought you said it was all okay!</i>

225
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,150
Yeah.

Do you want me to go...

You know, let's go out.

- Well... Do you want to?

242

- LIZ: No, I don't fucking want to!
- Okay. I just thought, you know...

It's not the only place in the world, Shaun!

244

Well, we could go to The Shepherd's, then,
they do Thai in there now.

245
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,340
I'm going out with David and Di.

246
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,640
SHAUN: Well, let's all go together.
LIZ: What, you hang out with my friends?

247
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,470
- Sorry, a failed actress and a twat?
- SHAUN: Well, that's harsh.

248
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,930
LIZ: Your words.
SHAUN: I did not call Dianne a failed actress.

249
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,350
Let's just go out, you know.

250
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,980
Let's just go out somewhere
and have a laugh.

251
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,650
Things'll be fine, I promise.

252
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,190
You promised you'd stop smoking
when I did.

253

- What...
- You promised you'd go back to the gym!

254
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,820
- I...
- You promised you'd try drinking red wine

255
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,860
- instead of beer!
- Well...

256

You promised you'd come on holiday
with me.

257

- We went to Greece, didn't we?
- We met in Greece.

258
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,830
- At a rave.
- It's just not the same.

259
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,750
- You promised things would change.
- You promised you'd get us free cable.

260
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,500
- I'm working on that.
- Okay.

261
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,500
Well, I can give up smoking.
I can give up whenever I want.

262
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,670
Look, see. Don't need them.

263
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,260
- What was the next one?
- It's not enough, Shaun.

264
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,850
Basically, I'd say your nine lives
are up, Shaun.

265
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,730
Get fucked, four-eyes!

What do you mean by that?

Oh! Yeah.

273
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,390
Yeah, that's because
I thought it would be funny

274
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,060
because of what you said last night
about me, you know,

275
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,560
you don't wanna be my mum and that,
and it's just a little joke.

276

It's something I just thought of,
spur of the moment.

277

- They're for your mum, aren't they?
- Yeah.

278
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,070
Smooth.

279

Look, if I don't do something,

I'm gonna end up in that pub, every night,

wondering what the hell happened.

283

What do you mean, "Do something"?

284
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,120
Fuck her!

285
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,750
You got your pint. You got your pig snacks.
What more do you want?

Shall I do Clyde?

288
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,070
See, I knew you'd get over her.

289
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,750
- Who the hell put this on?
- It's on random.

290
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,250
Ah, for fuck's sake. John, yes, please, mate.

291
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,260
You know what we should do tomorrow?

292
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,850
Keep drinking.
We'll have a Bloody Mary first thing.

293
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,810
Have a bite at the King's Head,
couple at The Little Princess,

294
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,480
we'll stagger back here and bang,
we're back at the bar for shots.

295
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,310
How's that for a slice of fried gold?

296
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,820
- No.
- Come on, man.

297
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,690
Talk to me.

298
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,450
She said if she stayed with me,
she'd end up coming in here, every night,

299
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,200
for the rest of her life, like these
sad old fuckers, drinking herself to death,

300

wondering what the hell happened.

301
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,170
That is harsh.
These are rich, interesting characters.

302
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,500
Like who?

303
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:24,090
Snakehips. Always surrounded by women.
He's a bigamist.

304
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,390
Strangled his first wife
with a draught excluder.

305
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,850
And he invented the mobile disco.

306
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Well, what about her, then?

307
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,940
Cockacidal maniac.

308
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,280
She's an ex-porn star. She's done it all.

309
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,030
They say she starred
in the world's first interracial hardcore loop.

310
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,780
<i>Café au Lait.</i>

Yeah. What about John, then?

313
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,830
ED: He's North London Mafia.

314
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,960
ED: It's true, Big Al says so.

315
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,760
Yeah, well, Big Al also says
dogs can't look up.

316
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,510
Think about it. Handy with a blade.
Gruff demeanor.

317
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,430
Bernie, the trophy wife. He's connected.

318
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,100
Why do you think
there's a rifle above the bar?

319
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,140
SHAUN: 'Cause the pub's called
the Winchester.

320
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,520
Exactly.

321
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,600
See, you don't need Liz to have a good time.

322
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,270
Oh, Ed, don't, man.

323
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,860
No. Look at me.
Can I just say one more thing?

324
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,030
I'm not gonna say, you know,
"There's plenty more fish in the sea."

325
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,370
I'm not gonna say,
"If you love her let her go."

326
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,740
And I'm not gonna bombard you
with clichés.

327
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,950
But what I will say is this,

328
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,750
"It's not the end of the world."

329
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,840
Sorry, we're closed.

330
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,300

- No, it's not. It's fucking Sunday,

351
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,470
and I've got to go to fucking work
in four fucking hours,

352
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,060
because every other fucker
in my fucking department is fucking ill!

353
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,400
Now can you see why I'm so fucking angry?

354
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,150
- Fuck, yeah!
- Hey.

355
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,570
Pete, look, I'm... You know, I'm sorry.

356
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,820
We just... We've had a couple of drinks.
We split up with Liz tonight.

Just keep it down, yeah?

358
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,790
Prick.

00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,160

- Nothing.

360
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,420
No, no, no, come on, stop it. We're friends!

361
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,630
He's not my friend. He's a fucking idiot!

362
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,800
What's that supposed to mean?

363
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,090
It means, why don't you fuck off?

364
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,760
You wanna live like an animal,
go and live in the shed, you thick fuck!

365
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,220
- Oh, leave him alone!
- Stop defending him, Shaun!

366
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,060
All he ever does is hold you back!

367

Or does it make your life easier
having someone around

368
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,390
who's more of a loser than you?

369

- You know what I mean.

370
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,530
I assume it was Liz who did the dumping?

371
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,610
Sort your fucking life out, mate!

372
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,950
What's up with your hand, man?

373
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,990
- I got mugged on the way home from work.
- By who?

374
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,160
I don't know, some crackheads
or something. One of them bit me.

375
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,460
Why did they bite you?

376
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,420
I don't know. I didn't stop to ask them!

377
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,630
Now, I've got a splitting headache
and your stupid hip-hop isn't helping.

378
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,090
And the front door is open again!

379
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,850
It's not Hip-Hop. It's Electro. Prick.

380
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,270
Next time I see him, he's dead.

381

Nelson? I haven't even...
I owe you about fifteen p.

Oh, dear.

We may have to kill my stepdad.

Listen, Mum, sit tight, okay?
You're not safe there. We're coming over.

Oh, God. Sorry, Pete. Listen,

00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
- What are you doing?
- What?

604
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,110
Ed, look out!

605
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,910
I think we hit something.

606
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,830
Or someone.

607
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,550
Are you all right?

608
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,590
Come on, let's just go.

609
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,840
Hello?

610
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,100
- He's gonna be dead either way.
- Ed, that's not the point.

611
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,400
Oh, thank God for that.

612
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:19,240
ED: Ah, hello. Who's a pretty boy, then?

613
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,750
You didn't tell me Barbara had a Jag.

614
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,540
Oh, I've always wanted to drive
one of those.

615
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,670
SHAUN: Yeah, well, it's Philip's, okay?
And he won't let anybody near it.

616
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,420
Honestly, I put half a Mars Bar
in the glove box once,

617
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,090
and he chased me round the garden
with a bit of wood.

618
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:34,250
Fuck, it's gorgeous.

619
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,840
Okay, well, it seems pretty clear,
we should go.

620
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,550
- Why don't I stay here?
- What, what, what, what, what?

621
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,350
You know, just look after the car.
If there's any problems,

622
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,560
I'll honk three times.

623
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,140
Okay.

624
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,820
- Don't forget to kill Philip!
- What?

625
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,320
- Hello, pickle.
- Hi, Mum.

626
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,490
- Oh, you've got red on you.
- Yeah.

627
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,910
Look, Mum, is everything okay?
Are you all right?

628
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,540
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Where's Philip?

629
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,500
- Dad's in the lounge.
- He's not my dad.

630
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,920
Oh, Shaun, really.

631
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,920
Sorry. Mum, look, I've got Ed outside.
We're gonna take you somewhere safe.

632
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,340
But we have to wait for the doctor.

633
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,670
Mum, I don't think
the doctor's gonna come.

634
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,670
I don't think Philip's going to want to
leave the house, darling.

635
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,550
Mum, Philip isn't...

636
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,930
Put the kettle on, and I'll deal with Philip.

637
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,760
- Okay.
- Okay, then.

638
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,600
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah. No, not really!

639
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,100
- I'll make some sandwiches.
- Okay.

640
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,060
No fighting, you two.

641
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,030
<i>MAN ON TV:... you may ask

642
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,200

645

- I'm so sorry, Philip.
- Why?

646
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,390
What have you done now?

647
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,810
- Nothing.
- What have you got there? Flowers, I hope.

648
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:10,770
- No, it's... Cricket bat.
- Oh, is that for the jumble, Shaun?

649
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,020
No. Yes.

650
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,980
There's a box of your toys upstairs.
I was going to give them to the jumble.

651
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,030
I took them all to the tip, Barbara.

652
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,570
- Oh, what?
- Shaun wants to take us somewhere.

653
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,490
Don't be silly. I'm not going anywhere.

654
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,780
Well, maybe you should stay here.

655
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,280
You know, wait for the doctor,
and I'll take Mum.

656
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,620
- But you said the doctor wasn't coming.
- You didn't call the doctor, did you?

657
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,330
Well, I thought we ought to be
on the safe side.

658
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,960
I'm quite all right, Barbara.

659
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,500
- I ran it under a cold tap.
- I really think...

660
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,960
We had our jabs
when we went to the Isle of Wight.

661
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,880
- But, Philip...
- It's a lot of overblown nonsense.

662
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,510
A lot of drug nuts running wild.

663
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,090
Still, I should get Mum away, you know,
just 'cause, in case they come back.

664
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,760
I'm not going anywhere without Philip.

665
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,060
Mum, look, how about that tea?

666
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,560
Mum? How much do you love Philip?

667
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,730
Two sugars, is it?

668
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:57,900
I haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982.

669
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,360
Oh, yes.

670
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,530
Will you cut me some bread, love?

671
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,900
Mum, look, how much do you love Philip?

672
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,160
Oh, Shaun, do we have to go through
all that again?

673
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,870
Mum, look, what would you say
if I told you that over the years

674
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,370
Philip's been quite unkind to me?

675
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,370
Well, you weren't always the easiest person
to live with.

676
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,250
Mum, he chased me around the garden
with a bit of wood!

677
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,210
Well, you did call him a you-know-what.

678
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,880
- Oh, what, did he tell you that?
- Yes, he did.

679
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,210
- Motherfucker.
- Shaun.

680
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,210
Sorry, Mother, Mum.

681
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,550
Look, Mum, did you know that
on several occasions he touched me?

682
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:35,060
That wasn't true.
Made it up, shouldn't have done, sorry.

683
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,520
- Mum, you don't understand, okay...
- No, it's you that doesn't understand.

684
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,110
Philip is my husband
and has been for the last 17 years.

685
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,570
I know you haven't always seen eye-to-eye,

686
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:46,240
but I would, at least,
expect you to respect my feelings.

687
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,860
You must be more adult about these things.

688
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:52,080
Yeah, come on, Shaun.

689
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:59,040
There comes a time
when you just got to be a man.

690
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:10,600
I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing.

691
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,680
- Hello, Edward.
- Hi, Barbara.

692
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,430
- BARBARA: My, how you've grown.
- Yeah, you better believe it.

693
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,560
What happened? Why is he coming?

694
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,020
It wasn't as easy as all that.

695
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,900
- ED: God's sake.
- So, we're following you, are we?

696
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,360
No, it's probably best if we...
Where's the car?

697
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,160
- I pranged it.
- You were parked!

698
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,450
Yeah.

699
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,540
I guess we'll have to take the Jag.

700
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,330
- Philip...
- What?

701
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,880
Look out!

702
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,420
PHILIP: Christ!

703
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,130
ED: Jesus!

704
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,890
- Philip, give me the car keys!
- You're not driving that car.

705
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,020
Philip! Give me the car keys!

706
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,690
- Ed, get Mum in the car.
- I'm on it.

707
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,650
- SHAUN: Come on.
- No, don't worry about me.

708
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,400
Worry about your mother.

709
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,110
- Ed, maybe I should drive.
- Man, I've adjusted the seat now.

710
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,610
All right, well, just, you know, be careful!

711
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,210
Can you please turn that noise down?

712
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,550
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?

713
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,720
I'd be fine,
if it weren't for that bloody racket!

714
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,510
- It is a bit loud.
- Sorry, Barbara.

715
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,390
You do realize this is
a 20 mile an hour zone.

716
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,770
Oh, yeah.

717
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,110
Here.

718
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,570
Okay, Mum, listen,
this isn't gonna take a second, all right?

719
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,780
Philip, have you still got the child locks on?

720
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,620
Safety first, Shaun.

721
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,240
You can't...

722
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,290
Hey, man, watch the leather.

723
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,460
Listen, okay, keep moving.
If there's any problems...

724
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,420
Yeah, yeah, I'll do the honks.

725
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,950
<i>DIANNE ON SPEAKER: Hello?</i>

726
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,950
Hello?

727
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,180
Guys, can you let me in, please?

728
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:05,100
- What are you doing?
- I've come to get you.

729
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,490
Sorry, what are you doing?

730
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,790
I've come to take you somewhere safe.

731
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:24,040
- We were perfectly safe before you arrived.
- You don't know that.

732
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,370
Well, there was two of them out there
a minute ago. How many are there now?

733
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,920
- Lots.
- Lots!

734
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,800
Look, believe me, it only takes one of them
to know you're in here.

735
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,010
Listen, I tried calling, I really did,
but I couldn't get through.

736
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,510
- I had to come up with a plan.
- Oh, you made a plan.

737
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,390
Look, I don't care what the telly says,
all right, we have to get out of here.

738
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:41,810
If we don't, they'll come up here
and they'll tear us to pieces.

739
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,480
And that is really gonna exacerbate things
for all of us.

740
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,310
- Shaun...
- Look, Liz,

741
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,310
this is not about you and me, all right?

742
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,730
This is about survival.

743
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,730
We need to be somewhere more secure,
somewhere on the ground,

744
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,690
somewhere we can stay alive.

745
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,900
- DIANNE: We're with you, Shaun.
- What?

746
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,360
We're with you.

747
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,910
I'm not going out there.

748
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,080
Daffs! I don't want to be torn to pieces,

749
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,500
and I'm sure if you really think about it,
neither do you.

750
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,000
- I'm not going if Liz is not going.
- Of course she's going.

751
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,920
- Well, I'm not staying here by myself.
- You're going, aren't you, Elizabeth?

752
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
- Lizzie?
- Liz?

753
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,760
All right, Flash, what do you have in mind?

754
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,640
Great, okay, I've got a car outside,
but it's gonna be a bit cramped now.

755
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,850
- So, has anyone got transport?
- Yes, yes.

756
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,600
- Great. Where?
- Oh, no. Well, I've passed my test.

757
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,100
David?

758
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,940
I don't see the point of owning a car
in London.

759
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,280
Look, okay, just get any blunt objects
together, all right?

760
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,030
If you get cornered, bash them in the head,
that seems to work.

761
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:40,950
Keep together, stay sharp and follow me.

762
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:45,080
- So, what... What's the plan, then?
- We're going to the Winchester.

763
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,750
Okay? Let's go.

764
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,100
- Come on.
- Where's the car?

765
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,280
What's up, niggaz?

766
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,780
Okay, apologies for the cramped conditions,
everybody, okay? Di, stay on David's lap?

767
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:26,490
- Okay.
- Philip, hang in there, okay?

768
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,460
- Ed, get there fast, yeah?
- Yeah.

769
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,960
And, Mum, this is Liz. Liz, Mum.

770
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,330
- Hello.
- Hello.

771
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,090
- Ed.
- Shaun.

772
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,840
I know. Ed, be careful.

773
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,390
- Is your dad all right?
- He's not my dad.

774
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,890
- DIANNE: He's bleeding.
- Yeah, I know. Ed, just be careful!

775
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,310
Thought you wanted to get there fast?

776
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:52,770
I just want to get there in one piece, okay?
And why are we going this way?

777
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,360
Chill out, it's a shortcut.

778
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,860
But that road goes straight
to the Winchester.

779
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:59,150
- Shaun.
- Look, I know. Liz, please!

780
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,280
I still don't actually understand
why we are going to the Winchester.

781
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,620
Because it's a pub, it's safe, it's secure.

782
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,620
- They know us there.
- What makes it so secure?

783
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,580
Because it's got big heavy doors
and deadbolts. You've been to a lock in.

784
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,120
- Several.
- And there's a rifle above the bar.

785
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:13,540
- I would think that's deactivated.
- Surely.

786
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,420
It's not. I'm telling you. John's connected.
Big Al says so.

787
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,420
Yeah, well, Big Al also says
dogs can't look up!

788
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,630
- They can't.
- Can't they?

789
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,130
- No, they can't!
- Of course they can!

790
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,970
- Are you sure? I...
- Yes, look, the pub is the right place to go.

791
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,930
Okay? Everything is gonna be fine,
I promise.

792
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,890
- Shaun?
- I turned it off, all right?

793
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,640
- It's not easy.
- What?

794
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:34,440
- Being a father, it's not easy.
- What?

795
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:39,360
You were 12 when I met you.
You'd already grown up so much.

796
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,070
I just wanted you to be strong and not
give up because you lost your dad.

797
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,330
Philip, you don't have to explain.

798
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:51,660
No, I do. I always loved you, Shaun.

799
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:57,500
I always thought you had it in you
to do well.

800
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,590
And you just need motivation.

801
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,260
Somebody to look up to, and...

802
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,140
I thought it could be me.

803
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,730
Would you just take care of your mum?

804
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,360
There's a good boy.

805
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,610
- Ed, can you pull over?
- Two seconds.

806
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,490
- Ed, please pull over.
- What for?

807
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,790
- Ed, just pull over!
- All right.

808
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,540
Whoa, mama!

809
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,050
Christ! What the hell do you think
you're doing?

810
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:45,630
- Chill out. Everyone's all right.
- Stop telling me to chill out!

811
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,930
And no, for your information,
everybody is not all right.

812
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:50,720
BARBARA: What's wrong?

813
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:54,310
- Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.
- Where's he gone?

814
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:57,560
- Mum, he's dead.
- No, he isn't.

815
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,570
Get out! Get out!

816
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,900
Oh, Jesus! Fuck, fuck.

817
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:06,490
It won't open! It won't open!

818
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,910
- Ed, get the child locks!
- DIANNE: Come on, quick, come on.

819
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,080
It won't open.

820
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:14,830
Ed!

821
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,930
- Now what?
- We've got to keep moving.

822
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,770
- How do we get Philip out the car?
- SHAUN: We haven't got time.

823
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,600
- LIZ: What about the blunt objects?
- Do you want to get them?

824
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,900
- Shaun, we can't just leave your dad!
- He's not my dad!

825
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,530
- Oh, Shaun...
- Mum, he was, but he's not anymore!

826
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,610
- I really think we could...
- No, listen to me, Mum, listen.

827
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,570
That's not even your husband in there.

828
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,860
Okay? I know it looks like him,

829
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:53,280
but there is nothing of the man you loved
in that car now, nothing!

830
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,540
Let's go, shall we?

831
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,710
You're not seriously suggesting we walk!

832
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,880
- Everybody okay back there?
- ED: Oh, yeah, we're having a whale of a time.

833
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,930
Maybe we should all hold hands,
like a crocodile?

834
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,140
Do you have any idea
where we're actually going?

835
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,810
- LIZ: David, come on.
- Sorry.

836
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,980
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, totally, totally.

837
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,730
Well, are we close?

838
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,570
SHAUN: We're pretty close.

839
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:29,990
LIZ: Is your mum gonna be okay?
SHAUN: Yeah, I hope so.

840
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,450
Did you manage to get in contact
with your folks?

841
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,660
- They're in Antigua.
- Do you think this is happening there?

842
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,540
I hope not.

843
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,830
Listen, Liz, about last night. You know,
I know loads of things were said, but...

844
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,670
Shaun, you said this wasn't about you
and me.

845
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,330
- No, no, it's not, but, I just...
- You said it was about survival.

846
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,500
Yeah, it is, but what I'm saying is...

847
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,250
You're not doing all this
just to prove something, are you?

848
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,340
No, of course not. I just think...

849
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,920
Because I meant everything I said
last night. Nothing's changed.

850
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,300
Maybe this isn't the best time
to talk about it.

851
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,220
- Okay...
- Oh, my God!

852
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,520
Shaun.

853
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,600
- Yvonne.
- How's it going?

854
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,400
- Surviving.
- Hey, Liz.

855
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,110
- Long time no see.
- Hey, Yvonne.

856
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,860
This is my boyfriend, Declan.

857
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:16,200
My friends Mark, Maggie,
my mum and my cousin Tom.

858
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,580
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.

859
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,370
- They've split up, actually.
- YVONNE: Oh, really?

860
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,880
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.

861
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,710
Well, we should scoot.

862
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:29,090
- Have you got somewhere you're going?
- Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.

863
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:30,470
The pub?

864
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,390
- Yeah.
- Right, well. Good luck!

865
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,890
- Hi!
- Hi!

866
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

867
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:45,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

868
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

869
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,730
- All right.
- All right.

870
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,070
See, what did I say?
The Winchester's just over there.

871
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,530
- Over where?
- Over there.

872
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,200
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?

873
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:03,460
What's the matter, David,
never taken a shortcut before?

874
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:25,770
Shaun, I'm sure Jill and Derek
live round here.

875
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:43,160
Now, the Winchester is just over that fence,
all right?

876
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,670
So, everyone stay where they are. I'll...

877
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,790
- Hang on, are we all here?
- One, two, three, four, five. Yes.

878
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,630
- There's six of us.
- Oh.

879
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:53,460
Mum!

880
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,720
I'm coming!

881
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,760
Mum, Mum! Mum, are you okay?
Are you okay?

882
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:03,680
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.

883
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,190
Shaun?

884
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,730
Are you all right?

885
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,550
What are you doing?

886
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:36,550
DIANNE: Shaun!

887
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,510
Yes!

888
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,770
No, that's rubbish.

889
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,110
- Oh!
- Yes!

890
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,860
Feel free to step in any time!

891
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,490
- You did all right.
- I didn't want to cramp your style.

892
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,870
- Why?
- I'm so sorry about that.

893
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,460
Right.

894
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:14,500
Okay, everyone just stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.

895
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:26,140
- Is it clear?
- No.

896
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,980
- LIZ: How many?
- Lots.

897
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:41,570
Oh, well, that is just great.

898
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,530
There are a fair few of them, yes.

899
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,790
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme
up his sleeve?

900
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:49,250
This is hardly constructive, David!

901
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:50,330
No, Lizzie, this is a waste of time.

902
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,460
We should have stayed at the flat.

903
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:53,830
- Yeah, why didn't you?
- Because...

904
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,670
- Because...
- Because, because of Captain Wow!

905
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,760
Will you stop it!

906
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,930
Yes, we're not gonna get anywhere
by moaning.

907
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:14,940
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber. Or not.

908
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,780
Now, take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.

909
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,440
Almost like sleepwalking.

910
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:24,660
Look at the face, it's vacant
with a hint of sadness.

911
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,870
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.

912
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:29,200
Okay, let's try, shall we? Liz.

913
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:37,130
Nice, good vocal work. Okay.
Barbara, that's excellent.

914
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,880
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.

915
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,300
Daffs.

916
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,470
Come on!

917
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,260
Okay. It's mournful, sorrowful, you're dead,
and you hate it. Go.

918
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,560
Much better. Ed.

919
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,230
- I'll do it on the night.
- This is the night!

920
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,650
- What is that?
- What about yours?

921
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:00,650
Who died and made you fucking king
of the zombies?

922
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,070
Don't.

923
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,660
- Yeah, that's pretty good.
- Okay, right.

924
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,330
Let's all try together, shall we?

925
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:13,080
One, two, three.

926
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:10,010
Go, go, go, go.

927
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:14,180
Shit. Get round me, get round me.

928
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:19,020
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.

929
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,520
- They can hear you.
- We do the quiz.

930
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:23,230
- They know.
- Stay in character, Daffs!

931
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,400
- I can't see them.
- Shaun, we have to get inside.

932
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:28,570
- Break the window.
- Don't be stupid, we'll be totally exposed!

933
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,280
We are totally exposed. Break the window!

934
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:32,620
- Is there another way in?
- Well, yeah, there's...

935
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,000
Two seconds.

936
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,830
<i>- Hey, Noodle.
- You all right, mate?</i>

937
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,960
<i>- Yeah, man, I can't really talk now.
- Did you get anything yet?</i>

938
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,420
<i>- I got nothing.
- Really?</i>

939
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,800
<i>- No, I'm right in the middle of something.
- A bit mentalist, isn't it?</i>

940
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,090
Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?
Oi! What are you doing?

941
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,510
What am I doing?
What are you doing, you stupid moron?

942
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,760
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off!

943
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:54,850
Fuck fucking off!

944
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:57,230
- LIZ: Shaun...
- I've spent an entire life... Look at me.

945
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:59,520
I've spent my entire life
sticking my neck out for you,

946
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,310
and all you ever do is fuck things up!

947
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,110
Fuck things up and make me look stupid!

948
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:05,940
Well, I'm not gonna let you do it anymore.
Not today.

949
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,280
LIZ: Shaun...

950
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:09,910
Oh.

951
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:21,290
- You were saying about another way in?
- Yeah, there's a...

952
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:24,500
What are you doing?

953
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,460
No!

954
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:29,970
- Get inside!
- No, they'll follow us!

955
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,140
- What?
- They'll follow us.

956
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,680
Just keep up the act,
I'm gonna have to do something.

957
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,260
What do you mean, "Do something"?

958
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,470
Hello, hello, over here, over here!

959
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:41,060
Come on, come on, that's it, yeah, come on,
come on, that's it, over here!

960
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, over here!
Yeah, come on!

961
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:46,150
Oh, bollocks.
Okay, wait till I've gone, then get inside!

962
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,230
- Gone where?
- Gone where?

963
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,690
I won't be long, I promise.

964
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:53,990
Come on, you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go!
Follow me. Come on, let's go!

965
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:58,660
Come on, this way, this way, that's it,
come on! Come on. This way, follow me.

966
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,960
Come on, follow me. Come on!

967
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,210
Come and get it! It's a running buffet!

968
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:06,340
All you can eat!

969
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,460
Shall we go in, then?

970
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:20,310
- Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
- I think they're for me.

971
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,210
- He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
- Seventeen.

972
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:46,750
Either way, we need to think about
blocking up this window here.

973
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,380
We're totally exposed.

974
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:52,130
- How will Shaun get back in?
- I'm sure he'll knock.

975
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,220
Oh, for goodness sake,
let's get some lights on here.

976
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,680
David, wait!

977
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:00,720
- Power's off.
- That's a good thing.

978
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,270
We don't want to advertise our whereabouts
more than we already have.

979
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:05,980
- No, of course not.
- Do we, David?

980
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:10,440
No, of course not, Lizzie.
I'm just being proactive.

981
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,150
There's no lights, there's no power.
Where are the owners?

982
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,200
And there's that
bloody great hole in the window.

983
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,660
- You did that, you twat!
- Somebody had to do something!

984
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:20,620
I don't know if you noticed back there,
but we were in a spot of bother.

985
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,290
Somebody has to take control
of the situation,

986
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:27,000
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

987
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:30,090
then perhaps I should.

988
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:32,420
Will Shaun be gone long?

989
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,800
- LIZ: He'll be back soon.
- How can you know that?

990
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,550
I don't think he'd leave us, Daffs.

991
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,510
Wouldn't he?
Lizzie, how can you put your faith in a man

992
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,850
you spectacularly binned
for being unreliable?

993
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,810
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot

994
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,980
and an impenetrable fortress
are the same thing.

995
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:50,860
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?

996
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,690
I could get a round in.

997
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,610
Look, let's just keep quiet
and wait for Shaun.

998
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,530
We can barricade the window
when he gets back.

999
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,410
What then? How long? Days? Weeks?
A month?

1000
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:01,950
What about food?
What are we going to eat?

1001
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,080
- Toasties!
- Yeah, there's a Breville out back.

1002
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,000
Oh, great, then! Saved by nibbles!

1003
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,710
That must be why Shaun took us here
before he buggered off.

1004
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:12,960
- He's coming back!
- Why? Because he promised?

1005
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,630
And even if he does, do you think
his master plan's going to extend

1006
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,430
to anything more than sitting
and eating peanuts in the dark?

1007
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:21,180
What, is he just gonna stroll in
and suddenly everything's gonna be okay?

1008
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:23,890
I don't know, David!

1009
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:25,930
I don't know any more than you do.

1010
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:30,860
But what I do know is that we're here now
and we have to make the best of it!

1011
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,320
- Ed, get me a double vodka.
- Right you are.

1012
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,150
Think I'll have a drink, too, actually.

1013
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,160
- Would you like a drink, Barbara?
- Hello.

1014
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,450
Right, great, fuck it.
That's what we'll do, that's what we'll do.

1015
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,160
We'll all have a party. How about that?
We all get completely smashed.

1016
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,170
Oh, look, we've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars...

1017
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,830
- David!
- We got Twiglets.

1018
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,090
Oh, look, Hog Lumps.

1019
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:00,760
- Pickle.
- Hello, Mum. You all right?

1020
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,510
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

1021
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,310
- Any sign of John and Bernie?
- We haven't seen them.

1022
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:06,140
- Check upstairs?
- I think it's locked.

1023
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:09,650
- What's the phone situation?
- Dead. Same as the power.

1024
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:11,690
SHAUN: Okay.

1025
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,690
Nice of you to join us.

1026
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,860
Yeah, well, I promised, didn't I?

1027
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,790
How did you lose them?

1028
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:30,330
I just gave them the slip. Wasn't difficult.
They're not all that.

1029
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,170
Well, how did you get in?

1030
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:33,880
There is a back door, David.

1031
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,050
I tried to tell you
before you went and smashed the window.

1032
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:39,550
Well, I wasn't the one who was blowing
our cover by having a tiff with my boyfriend.

1033
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,050
He's not my boyfriend.

1034
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,550
Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.

1035
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,970
Thanks, babe.

1036
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,770
So, what's the plan, then?

1037
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,270
Would anyone like a peanut?

1038
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,780
Why don't you do your Clyde?

1039
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:08,620
<i>Oh, come... Has anyone seen
Every Which Way But Loose?</i>

1040
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:11,370
Ed does the most amazing impression
of the orangutan.

1041
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:14,250
- No, it's not.
- It is. Come on. Do it.

1042
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,380
- No, no.
- But it's brilliant. Come on, just do it.

1043
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,590
Do it, it'll work. Come on, just do it.

1044
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:19,090
You've built it up too much,
I feel uncomfortable.

1045
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,300
- No, you don't. Just do it.
- DIANNE: Oh, come on, do it.

1046
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,180
See. Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.

1047
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,850
- Do it, do it, do it, do it.
- DIANNE: Come on, do it.

1048
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,060
I'm not a performing monkey.

1049
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:33,690
- The power's on.
- It's not, I tried it earlier.

1050
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:35,940
No, but the streetlights have come on.
It means the grid isn't out.

1051
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,150
It's the fuses. I'll just flip them back on,
we can watch television.

1052
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:39,280
LIZ: What about the lights?

1053
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,320
Yes, we don't want to advertise our
whereabouts more than we already have.

1054
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,530
The lights operate on a separate circuit,
I'll just flip the mains breakers.

1055
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,660
It's quite simple, David.

1056
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:18,610
- Is that it?
- LIZ: That's it!

1057
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:48,930
Liz, have you got a quid?

1058
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,100
Yeah.

1059
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:02,230
Never anything on, is there?

1060
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:07,610
What?

1061
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,790
I think we might have a bit of a problem.

1062
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,160
What do you mean?

1063
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,630
They followed me.

1064
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,750
I thought you said you gave them the slip.

1065
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,960
Yeah.

1066
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,390
Well, we'll just have to be extra quiet, then,
won't we?

1067
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,390
What?

1068
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:36,480
- Ed, no!
- Ed, no!

1069
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,850
Turn it off!

1070
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:12,470
Shit!

1071
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,060
- Where the hell did he come from?
- I don't know.

1072
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,310
- Who the hell put this on?
- It's on random.

1073
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,440
For fuck's sake!

1074
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,940
Okay, Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.

1075
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:27,240
- What?
- The jukebox!

1076
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,860
Liz, Ed, grab something weapony.

1077
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:30,910
- ED: What about the rifle?
- It's not real!

1078
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,280
- Cocktails?
- What do you mean?

1079
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:36,160
The flaming spirits. Drambuie, sambuca,
brandy. Get a rag in. Light it.

1080
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,910
- But the whole place could go up.
- What, then?

1081
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,370
How about pool?

1082
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,420
Okay, John, it's time at the bar!

1083
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:12,410
- I can't find the switches!
- Well, then get the fuses!

1084
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:49,110
- Why is Queen still on?
- We have a situation!

1085
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:50,280
I know!

1086
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:52,530
- Fuck this.
- Ed!

1087
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:54,160
Two seconds.

1088
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,280
Oi!

1089
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,790
Shaun!

1090
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,000
No!

1091
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,300
Yes! Yes! In the head!

1092
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,770
Shauny!

1093
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:38,120
Why didn't you just shoot him, man?

1094
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,500
Ed, for the last time, it's...

1095
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:46,960
I fucking knew it!

1096
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,540
What did I tell you? Big Al was right.

1097
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:50,710
Okay,

1098
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:57,090
but dogs can look up.

1099
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,930
- Okay, has anyone fired a gun before?
- Oh, yeah.

1100
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:04,940
- Apart from Ed?
- I'm a pacifist.

1101
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:06,140
Apart from David and Ed?

1102
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:07,730
Sorry, what was Ed's experience?

1103
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,980
He shot his sister in the leg with an air rifle.

1104
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,110
I think you should do it.

1105
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:13,740
- I think we should all do it.
- How can five people operate one gun?

1106
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:16,950
None of us have any real experience, okay?
Now, we've only got...

1107
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:18,620
- Twenty-nine.
- Twenty-nine bullets.

1108
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,450
- Call them "shells."
- We've only got 29 shells,

1109
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,910
we really need to work together on this.

1110
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:25,120
I need someone to help me reload,
everyone else to look out. I will fire.

1111
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,500
As Bertrand Russell once said,

1112
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:29,790
"The only thing that will redeem mankind
is cooperation."

1113
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,050
I think we can all appreciate
the relevance of that now.

1114
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:34,460
Was that on the back of a beer mat?

1115
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:35,920
Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.

1116
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,550
- I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

1117
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,890
- They definitely want to come in.
- Get Mum out of the way.

1118
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:46,640
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.

1119
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:51,190
- LIZ: Barbara?
- Oh, hello.

1120
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:54,030
- Would you like to come with me?
- That would be lovely.

1121
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:58,360
It's nice to meet you, finally.

1122
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:01,200
Shaun's always talking about you.

1123
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,660
- Really?
- Yeah.

1124
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:05,120
Barbara?

1125
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:08,620
Are you all right?

1126
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,210
I've got something for you.

1127
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:16,050
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.

1128
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:18,010
I'd like you to have it.

1129
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:21,390
- Barbara, Shaun and I have...
- It seems only right.

1130
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:41,410
I didn't want to say anything.
I thought Shaun would be worried.

1131
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,240
SHAUN: Liz?
DAVID: Here they come!

1132
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,250
SHAUN: Stay behind me! Stay behind me!
DIANNE: There's one!

1133
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:51,370
Sorry, we're closed!

1134
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:55,380
- Try the safety button.
- Yeah, that happened to me on stage.

1135
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,710
Cock it!

1136
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,390
- Over there!
- Over where?

1137
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:07,810
3:00.

1138
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,980
Over there again. Quarter to twelve.

1139
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,480
What?

1140
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:19,740
-11:45.
- Keep it simple!

1141
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,360
Top left.

1142
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,410
- Reload.
- I'm on it!

1143
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,250
Nice shot.

1144
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:37,050
Okay, David, Dianne,
let's block up this window!

1145
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,880
Ed, take over a sec.

1146
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:43,220
SHAUN: What is it? What's wrong?
LIZ: Shaun, I'm so sorry.

1147
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,510
- Mum, what's wrong?
- I didn't want to be a bother.

1148
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:51,730
Mum, I don't understand.

1149
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:53,770
The man in his pajamas...

1150
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:56,560
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.

1151
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:58,650
No, you should've said.

1152
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,240
- Take over a sec.
- DIANNE: What?

1153
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,700
- What's going on?
- ED: What's up? What's wrong?

1154
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,740
- What the hell's going on?
- Barbara's hurt!

1155
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:08,950
- Mum.
- Just take over a minute.

1156
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,210
- Jesus.
- DIANNE: I know first aid.

1157
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:17,590
- SHAUN: Just hang on. Mum? Mum?
- Is she...

1158
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:18,920
DIANNE: Shaun...

1159
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,380
Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine.

1160
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,050
- I never thanked you.
- For what?

1161
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,310
For these. "To a wonderful mum."

1162
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:34,230
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?

1163
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:40,440
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, Mum,
come on, Mum, stop it, stop it, stop it.

1164
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:44,150
Don't, Mum. Please don't go.

1165
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,330
- What are you doing?
- We have to deal with her.

1166
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:00,090
- Daffs!
- For Christ's sake!

1167
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,420
- She's gonna come back!
- SHAUN: She's not gone anywhere.

1168
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:05,680
- Well, she'll change.
- She's my mum.

1169
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,640
- She's a zombie.
- Don't say that!

1170
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,680
Move aside. I'm gonna count to three.

1171
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:15,270
One, two, three!

1172
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:17,730
Don't point that gun at my mum!

1173
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:19,520
Shaun, calm down!

1174
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:21,190
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

1175
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,280
- Ed, don't exacerbate things!
- What does that mean?

1176
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,490
This isn't exactly fair!

1177
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:26,910
- Here.
- Thank you.

1178
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:28,490
ED: It's okay.

1179
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,160
Please, can we just stop
and think about this?

1180
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,370
Tell him to put the gun down!

1181
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,710
Look, Lizzie, she's gonna change.
You know I'm right.

1182
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:39,920
And when she does,
she'll come back and she'll kill all of us.

1183
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,750
That's what your ex can't seem to realize.

1184
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,550
That's what this is about, isn't it?

1185
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:45,470
It's just... He just... He doesn't like me!

1186
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:47,760
He's always hated me
and now he wants to shoot my mum!

1187
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:48,840
She's not...

1188
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:51,350
You've never thought I deserved her,
that I was good enough.

1189
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:52,390
What are you talking about?

1190
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:55,180
Oh, come on,
we all know you're in love with Liz!

1191
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:56,350
That is not true!

1192
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,270
- SHAUN: Yes, it is!
- That is not true.

1193
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:00,310
- DIANNE: Yes, it is.
- What?

1194
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,900
I know you only hung out with me at college
to get close to Liz.

1195
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,900
And when she knocked you back,
I was there to pick up the pieces.

1196
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:10,370
I've come to terms with that, Daffs,
why can't you?

1197
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:14,490
Lizzie, I want you to know that my feelings
for you have always been essentially...

1198
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:18,080
David, please! There are slightly more
pressing matters at hand here!

1199
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,750
Like the fact
that "Daffs" is pointing a gun at my mum!

1200
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,090
I'm not the one
who's being unreasonable, "Pickle."

1201
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:24,920
For Christ's sake, she's not dead!

1202
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,010
She's finished!
For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite!

1203
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:31,140
You're the one that's gone from being
a Chartered Accountant to Charlton Heston!

1204
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:34,390
- I'm not a Chartered Accountant!
- Well, you look like one!

1205
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:36,350
- Yeah!
- I'm a lecturer!

1206
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:38,310
- You're a twat!
- Yeah!

1207
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:42,060
She's not your mum anymore!
In a minute she'll be just another zombie!

1208
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,860
- Don't say that.
- We're not using the Z word.

1209
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:49,860
Please, can we just calm the fuck down?

1210
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,870
Now, I can see what David is trying to say...

1211
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:57,200
- Thank you, Lizzie.
- ... even if he is being a twat!

1212
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:58,330
Yep.

1213
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:02,460
And, Shaun, Shaun, look at me.

1214
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:08,300
I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you,

1215
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:10,840
but we can't afford to fall apart.

1216
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:16,470
Shaun, babe,
I know you don't wanna hear this.

1217
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:37,330
You do it.

1218
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:49,630
I'm sorry, Mum.

1219
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:52,800
Do it!

1220
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:13,450
Well, I think we're all agreed,
you did the right thing there.

1221
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,000
David, no!

1222
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:26,710
- David.
- Right, I'm leaving.

1223
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:28,550
- What?
- I'm not staying here.

1224
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:31,970
- David, don't, it's suicide.
- I think you should go.

1225
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:33,800
We will.
We can run, we can defend ourselves.

1226
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:36,800
- What do you mean "we?"
- What do you mean, "What do I mean 'we"'?

1227
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:40,560
Opening that door now would be
a very, very silly thing to do.

1228
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,060
So, are you gonna stay here with him?

1229
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:43,810
- Look, Shaun...
- After everything he's gotten us into!

1230
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:45,650
You let me finish!

1231
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:49,150
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason that I did,

1232
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:52,070
'cause you didn't know what else to do.
Get away from that door this instant!

1233
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:53,780
- But...
- David!

1234
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:03,960
I'm so sorry, Dianne.

1235
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,670
Maybe I'm not the one
you should be apologizing to.

1236
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,710
Shaun...

1237
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:20,050
David! No!

1238
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:23,020
No, no, no, no!

1239
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:25,310
David!

1240
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,270
No, no!

1241
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:28,860
David!

1242
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,840
David!

1243
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:53,960
- Dianne, no!
- Dianne, no!

1244
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:55,170
I'm coming, David!

1245
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:58,300
David! David!

1246
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:03,180
Oh, dear.

1247
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,350
- Cocktails?
- Do it.

1248
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,860
Stay back!

1249
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,290
Shaun, hold them!

1250
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:29,870
Heads!

1251
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:36,260
- Ed!
- Hurry up!

1252
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,760
Shauny, look who it is.

1253
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,050
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

1254
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,850
Ed!

1255
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:48,100
- Shaun!
- Ed!

1256
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,020
Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!

1257
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:52,110
I can't hold them!

1258
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:56,900
No!

1259
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,820
- Shaun!
- Pete!

1260
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,370
I said, leave him alone!

1261
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:13,710
Ed! Ed!

1262
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:15,960
Shaun, bar!

1263
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:34,230
Ed!

1264
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,480
What?

1265
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:39,610
Chuck us a cloth will you?

1266
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:54,750
- Where are the shells?
- They're on the bar.

1267
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,170
Oh, fuck!

1268
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,170
Fuck it!

1269
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,720
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

1270
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,930
- The cellar!
- Maybe we can get out.

1271
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:09,100
There's a barrel hatch
that leads into the street.

1272
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:10,810
You mean go back outside?

1273
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,020
Oh, give us a fucking break!

1274
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,450
- Go!
- Go!

1275
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:35,040
I can see the street.

1276
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:37,880
Come on.

1277
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,760
Come on!

1278
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:44,340
Why won't it open?

1279
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,980
That's it, isn't it? We're trapped.

1280
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:58,980
"Hey, let's go to the Winchester!"

1281
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,230
Whose fucking idea was that?

1282
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,570
Man, I've really ballsed this up.

1283
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:10,830
- No, you haven't.
- I have, Liz. I couldn't save us.

1284
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:15,920
I couldn't save Di or David.
I couldn't even save my mum. I'm useless.

1285
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,290
You shouldn't feel so responsible, you tried.

1286
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:21,750
You did something, that's what counts.

1287
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:25,050
Yeah, I suppose.

1288
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:31,930
- Do you think they'll get through?
- Yeah.

1289
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:36,310
How many shells have we got left?

1290
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:43,610
Two. I suppose we could take
a few of them out if they stand in a line.

1291
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:48,700
- I wasn't thinking about them.
- I know.

1292
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:55,580
What about Ed? There's only two shells.

1293
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:57,670
ED: I don't mind being eaten.

1294
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,840
How are we gonna do this?

1295
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:06,760
I don't know.

1296
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:09,470
One of us has to go first.

1297
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:12,890
Maybe one should do the other
and then do themselves.

1298
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:16,430
Maybe you should do me.
I'll only muck it up if I have to do myself.

1299
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,070
Do you know, I don't think I've got it in me

1300
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:30,570
to shoot my flatmate, my mum
and my girlfriend all in the same evening.

1301
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,490
What makes you think I've taken you back?

1302
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:40,920
You don't want to die single, do you?

1303
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,670
ED: Actually, I would like to be shot.

1304
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:50,010
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had
a fag since yesterday, I promise.

1305
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:51,430
ED: He hasn't.

1306
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:56,470
Maybe we should have one now.

1307
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:01,270
- What...
- You left them in my flat.

1308
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,650
- Yeah, in the bin.
- I was desperate.

1309
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:07,780
- Sneaky monkey.
- Sorry.

1310
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:09,650
I won't say anything.

1311
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,630
Come on, we're getting out of here.

1312
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:28,800
- I might just stay here.
- Yeah, but we can get out.

1313
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,260
- I think you two should make a go of it.
- What are you talking about?

1314
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:35,720
- I only hold you back.
- Yeah, but...

1315
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:43,150
Maybe you should have this.

1316
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:45,770
Don't you want it?

1317
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:48,900
No. I can't hit anything with it anyway,
I'm rubbish.

1318
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:55,740
- Ed, I'm sorry.
- What for?

1319
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,750
'Cause I was shouting at you earlier on.

1320
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:02,750
It's all right. I'm sorry, too.

1321
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:08,380
- It's okay.
- No, I'm sorry, Shaun.

1322
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,590
Oh, God, God. That's not funny.

1323
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,850
I'll stop doing them
when you stop laughing.

1324
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:19,560
SHAUN: I'm not laughing.

1325
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:34,780
You better be off.

1326
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:46,710
Bye, Ed. Love you.

1327
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,000
Cheers.

1328
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:52,300
I love you, too, man.

1329
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,470
Gay!

1330
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,120

1334
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:05,960
How you doing?

1335
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:07,960
- Surviving.
- Surviving.

1336
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,210
They're taking us somewhere safe.
I thought you two might wanna...

1337
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:12,460
- SOLDIER: Move it!
- ... tag along.

1338
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:14,550
Is it just the two of you?

1339
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:20,220
Well, glad somebody made it.

01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,000
<i>I don't see nothing wrong with it,</i>

1356
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,540
<i>but I know that some people
would see something wrong with it.</i>

1357
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,750
<i>But he's my husband, you know.</i>

1358
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,920
<i>I still love him,
and I still got the ring on my finger, Trisha.</i>

1359
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:38,210
<i>You go to bed with it?</i>

1360
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,550
<i>WOMAN: 'Course I do.</i>

1361
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:44,140
<i>TRISHA: All right. Okay, you can't understand
why she's with him.</i>

1362
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,180
<i>Okay, what do you say to people
that criticize you for being with...</i>

1363
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:49,270
<i>WOMAN: Well, they don't have...</i>

1364
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:52,770
<i>MALE REPORTER:... initial claims that the
virus was caused by rage infected monkeys</i>

1365
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:54,730
<i>have now been dismissed as...</i>

1366
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:56,070
Hello.

1367
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,910
What's the plan, then?

1368
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:07,240
Right, a cup of tea,

1369
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:09,910
then we get the Sundays.

1370
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,500
Head down the Phoenix for a roast,

1371
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:14,830
veg out in the pub for a bit,

1372
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,500
then wander home, watch a bit of telly,
go to bed.

1373
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:21,130
- Perfect.
- I'll get the kettle on.

1374
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,680
Can I have two sugars, please?

1375
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,470
Adventurous.

1376
01:33:25,550 --> 01:33:27,930
Actually, I might pop into the garden
for a bit.

1377
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:29,970
Go on, then.

1378
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:31,560
Two seconds.

1379
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,530
<i>MALE VOICE ON TV:

1380

Still come back to you</i>

1396
