No, but it's run by people

480
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,667
with agendas, and agendas change.

481
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,680
That's good. That's why I'm here.

482
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,404
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...

483
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,028
I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.

484
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,523

485
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,519
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.

486

What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?

What if there is somewhere
we need to go

We may not be perfect,

but the safest hands are still our own.

If we don't do this now,

492

it's gonna be done to us later.

493
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,411
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.

00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,803

you wouldn't be here.

No. Definitely not.

We're taking a break.

It's nobody's fault.

878
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:45,607
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.

879
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,359
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.

880
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:52,356
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...

881
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,870
and then Ultron. My fault.

882
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:58,243
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

883
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:00,791
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.

884
00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:04,205
I don't wanna lose her.

885
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,995
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

886
00:59:10,632 --> 00:59:12,802
In her defence, I'm a handful.

887
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,470
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,

888

when he was young and single.

891
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,730
Oh, really? You two knew each other?

892
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:26,192
He never mentioned that.

893
00:59:26,356 --> 00:59:28,976
Maybe only a thousand times.

I know, because you're
a very polite person.

897

00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:54,546
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.

904
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,594
But I don't wanna see you gone.

905

We need you, Cap.

Sure.

913

Once we put out the PR fire,

914
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,376
those documents can be amended.

915
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:32,439
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...

916
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:34,303
Wanda? What about Wanda?

917
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,277
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.

918
01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:37,511
Vision's keeping her company.

It's got a screening room.

923

There's worse ways to protect people.

924
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:45,849
Protection?

925
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:47,651
Is that how you see this?

926
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,769
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.

927
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:51,333
- She's not a US citizen.
- Oh, come on, Tony.

928

And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.

01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,193
It's about time we met.

1148
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:29,980
You've been getting my emails, right?

1149
01:17:30,188 --> 01:17:31,768
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

1150
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:32,982
Regarding the...

1151
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,210
You didn't even tell me about the grant.

1152
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:35,878
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.

1153
01:17:35,902 --> 01:17:36,902
- Right.
- Yeah.

1154
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:37,985
Remember when you applied?

1155
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:39,111
Yeah.

1156
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:41,781
I approved, so now we're in business.

1157
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:44,489
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

1158
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:45,763
You keeping secrets from me now?

1159
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:49,577
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...

1160
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,750
Anyway, what did I apply for?

1161
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:53,062
That's what I'm here to hash out.

1162
01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:54,456
Okay. Hash it out, okay.

1163
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:57,166
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.

1164
01:17:57,341 --> 01:17:59,591
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?

1165
01:18:00,052 --> 01:18:02,222
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.

1166
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:03,906
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.

1167
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,730
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?

1168
01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:09,203
TONY: Yeah, it's pretty well funded.

1169
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:10,397
Yeah? Wow.

1170
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:12,109
Look who you're talking to.

1171
01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:14,322
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.

1172
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:23,528
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

1173
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:27,616
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?

1174
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:29,579
Thrift store? Salvation Army?

1175
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:31,851
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?

1176
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:32,955
Yeah, I was...

1177
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:34,503
Anyway, look, um,

1178
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:36,306
I definitely did not apply
for your grant...

1179
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,920
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.

1180
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:40,506
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

1181
01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:43,803
That's you, right?

1182
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:45,179
Um, no.

1183
01:18:45,347 --> 01:18:46,827
- (STAMMERS) What do you mean?
- Yeah.

1184
01:18:47,808 --> 01:18:49,428
Look at you go.

1185
01:18:49,601 --> 01:18:52,731
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

1186
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:55,646
That's not easy. You got mad skills.

1187
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,729
That's all on YouTube, though, right?

1188
01:18:57,818 --> 01:18:59,318
That's where you found that?

1189
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:00,588
Because you know that's all fake.

1190
01:19:00,612 --> 01:19:01,812
It's all done on the computer.

1191
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:02,913
Mmm-hmm.

1192
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:05,079
It's like that video. What is it?

1193
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:07,122
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

1194
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:08,202
Exactly.

1195
01:19:08,537 --> 01:19:09,827
Oh, what have we here?

1196
01:19:11,206 --> 01:19:12,916
- Uh...
- (CLATTERS)

1197
01:19:14,126 --> 01:19:15,336
(EXHALES)

1198
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:20,804
You're the Spider-ling.

1199
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:22,836
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

1200
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,259
Spider-Man.

1201
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:29,469
Not in that onesie, you're not.

1202
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,936
It's not a onesie.

1203
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:34,705
I don't believe this.
I was actually having

1204
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:36,519
a really good day today, Mr Stark.

1205
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:39,860
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...

1206
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:43,105
and Algebra test, nailed it.

1207
01:19:43,905 --> 01:19:45,365
Who else knows? Anybody?

1208
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,080
Nobody.

1209
01:19:48,452 --> 01:19:50,452
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?

1210
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,910
No. No.

1211
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,670
No! If she knew, she would freak out.

1212
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,543
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

1213
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:58,835
You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.

1214
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,510
That tensile strength is off the charts.

1215
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:03,971
Who manufactured that?

1216
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:05,469
I did.

1217
01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:08,143
Climbing walls, how you doing that?

1218
01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:09,555
Adhesive gloves?

1219
01:20:09,723 --> 01:20:11,023
It's a long story. I was...

1220
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:13,851
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1221
01:20:14,019 --> 01:20:15,019
Yes, I can.

1222
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:16,347
I'm blind!

1223
01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:18,904
I can see in those.

1224
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:19,895
Okay?

1225
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:22,396
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...

1226
01:20:22,486 --> 01:20:24,776
it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.

1227
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:29,622
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.

1228
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:32,200
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

1229
01:20:32,287 --> 01:20:34,657
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

1230
01:20:34,748 --> 01:20:35,868
That's why I'm here.

1231
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:39,923
Why you doing this?

1232
01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:42,508
I gotta know, what's your MO?

1233
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:44,509
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?

1234
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:46,343
Because...

1235
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:48,757
(STAMMERS)

1236
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:52,348
Because I've been me my whole life,

1237
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:54,102
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1238
01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:55,729
Mmm-hmm.

1239
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:58,190
I read books, I build computers.

1240
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:02,067
Yeah, I would love to play football,

1241
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,750
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.

1242
01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:05,454
Sure, because you're different.

1243
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:08,532
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

1244
01:21:12,244 --> 01:21:16,544
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

1245
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,089
and then the bad things happen...

1246
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:23,456
they happen because of you.

1247
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:30,724
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?

1248
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:33,097
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?

1249
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:35,888
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.

1250
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:38,483
That's what it is.

1251
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,895
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.

1252
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:52,871
(TONY EXHALES)

1253
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:58,040
You got a passport?

1254
01:21:58,123 --> 01:21:59,642
No, I don't even have a driver's licence.

1255
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:01,126
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.

1256
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:02,209
Oh, you'll love it.

1257
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:04,339
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?

1258
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:08,008
I got homework.

1259
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:10,585
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1260
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:12,905
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

1261
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:14,049
Might be a little dangerous.

1262
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:16,257
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.

1263
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,650
Don't tell Aunt May.

1264
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:22,559
All right, Spider-Man.

1265
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:27,402
Get me out of this.

1266
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:28,609
Sorry. I'll get the...

Stay here, please.

(GASPS)

1271
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:52,509
Guess I shoulda knocked.

1272
01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:56,104
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

1273
01:22:56,264 --> 01:22:58,564
Disappointing my kids.

1274
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,863
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.

1275

1277
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:10,702
You should not be here.

1278
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,281
Really?

1279
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:17,873
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

1280
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:20,329
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.

1281
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:21,497
Okay, they're considered.

01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:22,711
(GROANS)

1283
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:24,384
Okay, we gotta go.

1284
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:30,045
It's this way.

1285
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:32,427
I've caused enough problems.

You gotta help me, Wanda.

Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1289
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:42,557
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1290
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:44,561
Shit.

(GROANS)

1292
01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:52,902
I knew I should've stretched.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

1294
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:09,001
VISION: Clint, you can't overpower me.

1295
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,010
I know I can't.

1296
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:13,169
But she can.

1297
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:17,798
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

1298
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:19,722
I'm leaving.

1299
01:24:19,848 --> 01:24:20,968
I can't let you.

1300
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,360
I'm sorry.

1301
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:32,689
If you do this...

1302
01:24:33,153 --> 01:24:36,163
they will never stop being afraid of you.

1303
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:40,945
I can't control their fear, only my own.

1304
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:54,423
CLINT: Oh...

1305
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,802
Come on. We got one more stop.
