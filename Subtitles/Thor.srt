mankind accepted a simple truth,

that they were not alone
in this universe.

- Political science.

She was the only applicant.

333
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,986
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection

334
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,317
between two different points
of space-time.

335
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,742
It's a wormhole.

336
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,821
- Erik, look. What do you see?
- Stars.

337
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,747
Yeah, but not our stars.

338
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,577
See, this is the star alignment
for our quadrant this time of year,

339
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,789
and unless Ursa Minor decided
to take a day off,

340
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,090
these are
someone else's constellations.

341
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,008
Hey! Check this out.

342
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,597
No, it can't be.

343
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,772
I think I left something at the hospital.

344
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,368
It's not possible!

He just went nuts.

DARCY: Oh, my God.

348
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,613
I just lost
my most important piece of evidence.

349
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,735
Typical.

350
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,987
- So now what?
- We find him.

351
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,443
Did you see what he did in there?

352
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,324
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

353
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,747
Well, our data can't tell us
what it was like to be inside that event,

354
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,496
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

355
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,622
DARCY: Okay.

356
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,329
So we're gonna look
all over New Mexico, right?

357
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,755
Exactly.

JAN E: What?

359
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,260
I'm so sorry.
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,404
Sir, we found it.

368
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,006
You know, for a crazy homeless person,
he's pretty cut.

My ex.

Good with patients
and bad with relationships.

They're the only clothes I had
that would fit you.

They will suffice.

You're welcome.

This mortal form has grown weak.

380
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,271
We should never have let him go.

381
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,015
There was no stopping him.

382
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,066
FANDRAL: Well, at least
he's only banished, not dead.

383
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,439
Which is what we'd all be

384
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,237
if that guard hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.

385
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,113
How did the guard even know?

386
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,705
I told him.

387
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,204
What?

388
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,877
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

389
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,379
He should be flogged for taking so long.

390
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,001
We should never have
reached Jotunheim.

391
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,127
You told the guard?

392
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,213
I saved our lives.

393
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,135
And Thor's.

394
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,680
I had no idea Father would banish him
for what he did.

395
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:20,882
Loki.

396
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,435
You must go to the Allfather
and convince him to change his mind.

397
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,146
And if I do, then what?

398
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,066
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is.

399
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,270
He's arrogant.
He's reckless. He's dangerous.

400
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,321
You saw how he was today.

401
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,073
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

402
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:46,580
He may speak of the good of Asgard,
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

403
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,748
We should be grateful to him,
he saved our lives.

404
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,917
Laufey said

405
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,499
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

406
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,426
A master of magic
could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

407
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,929
FANDRAL:
Loki's always been one for mischief,

408
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,430
but you're talking
about something else entirely.

409
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,290
ODIN: Stop!

410
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,454
LOKI: Am I cursed?

411
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,959
ODIN: No.

412
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,298
What am I?

413
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,804
You're my son.

414
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,975
What more than that?

415
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,404
The Casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day,

416
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,483
was it?

417
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,583
No.

418
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,753
In the aftermath of the battle,

419
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,672
I went into the temple
and I found a baby.

Small for a giant's offspring.

422

Abandoned, suffering, left to die.

00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,011
Laufey's son.

424
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,519
Laufey's son.

425
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,361
Yes.

426
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,948
Why?

427
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,703
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood,
why would you take me?

428
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,280
You were an innocent child.

429
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:52,368
No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?

430
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,039
(SHOUTING) Tell me!

431
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,551
I thought
we could unite our kingdoms one day.

432
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,972
Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.

433
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,640
Through you.

434
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,887
What?

435
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,307
But those plans no longer matter.

436
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,142
So I am no more
than another stolen relic,

437
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,694
locked up here
until you might have use of me.

438
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,237
Why do you twist my words?

439
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,314
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning,

440
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,399
why didn't you?

441
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,821
You're my son.

442
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,495
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

443
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,573
Because I'm the monster

444
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,750
parents tell their children about
at night?

445
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,915
- No, no.
- You know, it all makes sense now!

446
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,747
Why you favored Thor all these years!

447
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,709
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,

448
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,420
you could never have a Frost Giant
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

- What was that?
- It was delicious. I want another.

- I just did.

- No, I mean, ask nicely.
- I meant no disrespect.

460
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:46,864
All right. Well, no more smashing.

461
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,448

out at the crater.

of satellite landed out in the desert.

Did you say there was a satellite crash?

What did it look like, the satellite?

I don't know anything about satellites,
but it was heavy.

474

I mean, nobody could lift it.

475
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,944
They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.

Which way?

- To get what belongs to me.

it's theirs.

Yes.

If you take me there now,

502

He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

812

813
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,139


814
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,475
Accept.

815
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,899
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

816
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:34,148
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

817
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:36,066
You were shrouded from me,

818
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,322
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

819
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,996
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

820
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,744
Or perhaps someone has found a way

821
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:46,918
to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.

822
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,255
You have great power, Heimdall.

823
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,251
Did Odin ever fear you?

824
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,175
- No.
- And why is that?

825
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,516
Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.

826
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:06,017
He was your king
and you're sworn to obey me now.

827
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:07,938
Yes?

828
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,779
Yes.

829
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,199
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

830
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,118
until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

- We drank, we fought,

836
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,136

Yes, of course.

850

when I can't sleep

or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

I'm really glad you're safe.

854

You've been very kind to me,

855
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,397
and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.

856
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,274
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

857
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,397
so I think that kind of evens things out.

No, no, this is great! This is...

never sees the light of day.

Listen to me. You must not give up.

- You must finish what you've started.
- Why?

Because you're right.

Here, look.

874
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,366
Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

875
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,703
Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

876
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,893
What is that?

877
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,015
My father explained it to me like this,

878
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,850
that your world

879
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,777
is one of the Nine Realms
of the Cosmos,

880
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:44,856
linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil,

882
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,074
Now you see it every day
without realizing.

883
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,407

What did you call it?

884
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,658
This Hooble Telescope.

This is Alfheim.

And Asgard.

six pheasant, a side of beef,

break every oath you
have taken as warriors,

how did you get the Jotuns into Asgarol?

You think the Bifrost is the only way
in and out of this realm?

you are relieved of your duties

01:40:31,817 --> 01:40:33,160
NO, Loki.

1138
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:42,912
Loki, no.

1139
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:46,336
No!

1140
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:51,758
No.

1141
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:09,447
JANE: it's gone.

1142
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:18,595
(ALL LAUGHING)

1143
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:24,813
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1144
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:29,152
I flew into the giant metal creature
and laid him low!

1145
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:32,905
FANDRAL: Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?

1146
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:38,987
VOLSTAGG: As a matter of fact, falling
was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...

1147
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,011
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1148
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:03,185
FRIGGA: How is he?

1149
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:07,515
SIF: He mourns for his brother.

1150
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:10,021
And...

1151
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:12,778
He misses hen

1152
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:15,114
The mortal.

1153
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:33,291
You'll be a wise king.

1154
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:40,135
There will never be
a wiser king than you.

1155
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:43,222
Or a better father.

1156
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:57,277
I have much to learn.

1157
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:00,777
I know that now.

1158
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:07,749
Someday, perhaps,

1159
01:44:09,034 --> 01:44:10,957
I shall make you proud.

1160
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:20,805
You've already made me proud.

1161
01:44:35,352 --> 01:44:37,354
So Earth is lost to us.

1162
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:39,690
No.

1163
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,693
There is always hope.

1164
01:44:46,697 --> 01:44:48,199
Can you see her?

1165
01:44:49,492 --> 01:44:51,039
(HEIMDALL LAUGHS)

1166
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:52,461
Yes.

1167
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:58,046
ERIK: I have the particle detectors!

1168
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,219
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite codes?

1169
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:02,388
DARCY: Yeah. Have you seen my taser?

1170
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:03,885
THOR: How is she?

1171
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,058
ERIK: In the car. Come on, Jane!

1172
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,477
HEIMDALL: She searches for you.

1173
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:19,964
NICK FURY: Dr. Selvig.

1174
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:24,969
So you're the man behind all this?

1175
01:53:27,134 --> 01:53:29,136
It's quite a labyrinth.

1176
01:53:29,886 --> 01:53:33,811
I was thinking
they're taking me down here to kill me.

1177
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:43,985
I've been hearing
about the New Mexico situation.

1178
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:48,493
Your work has impressed a lot of people
who are much smarter than I am.

1179
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:50,574
I have a lot to work with.

1180
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:54,458
The Foster Theory.
A gateway to another dimension.

1181
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:56,121
It's unprecedented.

1182
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:00,084
Isn't it?

1183
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:06,848
Legend tells us one thing,
history, another.

1184
01:54:07,174 --> 01:54:11,395
But every now and then,
we find something that belongs to both.

1185
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:20,187
What is it?

1186
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:21,396
Power, Doctor.

1187
01:54:21,938 --> 01:54:23,940
If we can figure out how to tap it,

1188
01:54:24,358 --> 01:54:25,860
maybe unlimited power.

1189
01:54:31,615 --> 01:54:33,868
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

1190
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:37,872
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
