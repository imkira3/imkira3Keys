1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,036
Hey, babe, what's up?

3
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,090
- What is that?
- Hello, baby.

4
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,592
Hi.

5
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,220
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yes.

6
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,223
I don't know what you think it is,
but whatever it is, it's sweet.

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,436
I think it's a giant-ass camera.
What happened to the little handheld?

8
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,313
Easy to move around, versatile?

9
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,483
Are you gonna park the car or you
gonna stand there looking at me?

10
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,986
This is... big and impressive.

11
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,864
And it has a really bright light on it.

12
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,575
- Kiss the camera, please.
- I'm not kissing the camera.

13
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,869
How much did this cost you?

14
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,663
How much did...?
I'll kiss you, not the camera.

15
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,666
Turn that thing...

16
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,880
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, see.

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,049
You think this'll work?

18
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,426
I think we're gonna have
a very interesting time,

19
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,639
capturing whatever paranormal
phenomena is occurring or not occurring.

20
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,391
Seriously, what'd you
throw down for that?

21
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,311
Well, about half as much
as I made today.

22
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,191
Good thing you're cute. Dinner?

23
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,153
- Just keep going up the stairs.
- Oh, my God.

24
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,157
- All right, I'll make dinner.
- Good.

25
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,494
No. We're just gonna film
whatever happens to us,

26
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,081
and then when any weird shit goes on,

27
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,877
we will be in a perfect position
to capture it for posterity.

28
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,214
Oh, so we can always, like,
look back and remember fondly?

29
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,842
Well, you know, hopefully,
once we get it on camera,

30
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,427
- we can figure out what's going on.
- OK.

31
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:21,431
Once we know what's going on,
we can react appropriately.

32
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:26,603
- And...
- Take it from there.

33
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,400
Take care of it, whatever it is.
If it's one of those neighbors,

34
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,402
one of those kids
who's obsessed with you

35
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,113
and is trying to peep through a window
or something at night,

36
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,073
that will take care of them.

37
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,994
Unless that kid has been following me
since I was eight years old.

38
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,288
- Something pretty creepy.
- I don't think that's the thing.

39
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,455
You're telling me.

40
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,084
- You know, I realize that you're...
- Are you all right? Are you OK?

41
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,461
Are you doing OK?

42
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,048
- Are you talking to the...?
- Are you happy?

43
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,092
Do you have enough batteries?

44
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,304
You're supposed to be in love with me,
not the machine.

45
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,973
We are gonna be sleeping
with this camera.

46
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,142
- We're gonna what?
- Put it in the bedroom.

47
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,685
All night?

48
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,563
You're cute.

49
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,273
Yeah.

50
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,902
That was shy. You looked away.

51
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,743
Dinny time.

52
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:29,249
- Test, audio test.
- This is the last test, right?

53
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,585
Yeah. Can you just please talk, please?

54
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,589
Hello, Micah. You're the
best boyfriend in the whole world,

55
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,925
- except for your strange fascination
- Video's good.

56
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,011
- with electronics.
- Katie, say something.

57
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,306
- What do you want me to say?
- Something really quiet.

58
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,974
What do you want me to say?

59
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,976
- Whisper.
- I am whispering.

60
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,270
- Can you hear me?
- Whisper.

61
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,481
- I am whispering.
- You're not whispering.

62
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,483
I am whispering now.

63
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,652
That's a whisper,
and I think we caught it on camera.

64
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,030
All right, sweet,
this microphone is worth the cash.

65
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,115
All right, we're operational, babe.

66
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,326
Sweet!

67
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:10,165
Do you know of any tricks
to make this stuff happen?

68
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,044
I don't wanna make...
them, it, whatever...

69
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,837
I don't want it to happen at all.

70
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,590
So I don't wanna force it to happen.

71
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,844
You know, if it catches something,
great, but I'm not gonna like...

72
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,764
OK. I mean, I'm just saying 'cause
you know, have it on camera

73
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,059
would be pretty cool
for a lot of reasons, sweetie.

74
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,394
- It would...
- I know.

75
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,313
- ...substantiate your claims.
- You believe me, right?

76
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,023
Yeah, of course.

77
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,281
Hey.

78
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,709
What is that?

79
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,129
Let's investigate it.

80
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,548
We're hearing a weird sound.

81
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,058
You hear it?

82
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,607
Is it the fridge?

83
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,653
It's the icemaker.

84
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,823
Damn it!

85
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,243
It will only come out
when we sleep here.

86
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,078
I'd like to take this moment

87
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,248
to illustrate the beauty
of this fine instrument.

88
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,418
I meant her. This is just my guitar.

89
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,754
You're sweet.

90
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,010
- What is this?
- I just like your feet. They're sexy.

91
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,095
I need to repaint my toenails.

92
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,014
You shouldn't film my feet.

93
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,850
Sex type thing.
Can I get a little striptease?

94
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,270
Please? Just a half of one.

95
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,606
Just bra and panties.

96
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,360
- No.
- All right. I'll do anything you want.

97
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,527
No.

98
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,196
Bullshit.

99
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,284
Yeah, the Venus.
Hey, go back in your Venus pose.

100
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,204
No. So where are we gonna put it?

101
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,207
You've got the bathroom or the hallway.

102
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,835
I think it should point down the hall,
that's where we heard its footsteps.

103
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,295
It's kinda dark.

104
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,173
You can't see me here?

105
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,177
- Not at all.
- What if I turn this one on?

106
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,721
Yeah, that's good.

107
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,058
- That's cool? Need more light?
- No, I think you're fine.

108
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,310
- All right.
- Come check it out.

109
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,191
What happened with
putting the camera out here?

110
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,780
- We could get...
- It's gotta get old, right?

111
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,990
Careful. You're about
to run into the shower.

112
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,909
We could get extracurricular with this.

113
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,411
I mentioned it before.

114
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,747
- We could... but no.
- OK.

115
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,332
Nice try, though.

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,335
I just want you to know
I'm crying inside.

117
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,964
I'm putting this thing back.

118
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,009
OK, now hook up the FireWire.
Going off.

119
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,932
- Is it working?
- It is, or isn't?

120
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,726
Yeah, I think it's good.

121
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,982
Oh, God.

122
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,452
How am I supposed to
sleep with that?

123
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,204
It'll be fine.

124
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,766
It's looking at me.

125
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,428
This is what Katie looks like
in the morning.

126
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,432
She is so pretty.

127
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:43,438
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Whatever. What the hell...

128
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,650
"Whatever" isn't an answer.
How about scrambled eggs?

129
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,111
- Sounds pretty good.
- Yeah? Good.

130
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,658
- Hey, babe?
- What?

131
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,619
Did you drop my keys on the floor?

132
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,454
Hold on.

133
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,456
My keys are in the middle of the floor.

134
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,625
I just... Look where I found my keys.

135
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,296
- Where did you leave them?
- I left them on the counter.

136
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,131
Are you sure?

137
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,218
Yes. I always leave them in
the same spot, next to your wallet.

138
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,055
Obviously, this is
incontrovertible evidence

139
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,184
that evil forces came from beyond
the grave to move your keys.

140
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,103
Make your breakfast.

141
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,234
That would be a 3.0 on the splash scale.

142
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,821
- What are you doing up there?
- I'm filming you.

143
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,989
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

144
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,957
Very, very mature. I think that's my...

145
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,333
I got a big one!

146
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,796
I think that's my favorite quality
in you, it's your maturity.

147
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,175
Big day. It's the day of the psychic,
he's coming.

148
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,261
He should be here within the hour.

149
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,180
We're gonna go find Micah
and see how he's feeling about it.

150
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,932
My guess? Very excited.

151
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,688
All right, tell me how excited
you are to meet our psychic.

152
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:11,484
- Who will be here within the hour.
- The doctor will be here? Great.

153
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,446
So excited, I can't contain myself.

154
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,532
Can't contain yourself?
Let it all out. Don't be shy.

155
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,580
I got something quite appropriate
for your psychic, though, I think.

156
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,708
- What?
- I just, you know, stumbled upon it.

157
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,168
Show me.

158
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,546
Maybe I'll play this when he gets here.
I think it'll make him feel at home.

159
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,262
You are totally not taking
this seriously, are you?

160
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,558
Don't you wanna make him feel at home
and welcome in his own environment?

161
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,893
I mean, this way...

162
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:49,356
This is not gonna make him feel at home.
This is gonna make him leave.

163
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,608
We're not gonna insult...
You, not me. You.

164
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,903
Don't you smile like
you're so happy with yourself.

165
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,322
How 'bout less music?

166
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,907
That was good.

167
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,993
Is the psychic gonna give me some
stock tips while he's here?

168
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,788
Haven't bet on the horses in awhile.

169
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,458
- Maybe if you're good.
- An opinion on the hundred-to-one shot?

170
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,918
- Stock?
- I'm done with you.

171
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,046
So you'd think a psychic
would be on time.

172
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,759
You know, like he could foretell
if the traffic was gonna be bad?

173
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,260
You're clever.

174
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,429
Wait, let me get my music.

175
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,432
Don't you even think about
turning that on.

176
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,478
- Hi. Dr. Fredrichs?
- Yes. Hi.

177
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,689
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Come on in.

178
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,315
- This is Micah.
- Oh, hi. Micah.

179
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,650
I'm sorry for the camera.

180
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,152
So can you see ahead of, like,
that kind of thing?

181
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,447
- Like know when traffic's gonna be bad?
- Cut.

182
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,784
Oh, usually it depends on the day
of the week, or the time of the day.

183
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,202
- You know.
- Like all of us.

184
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,247
I never hesitate when somebody
says, "Will you come to San Diego?"

185
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,915
I'm always ready to do that.

186
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,711
I'm certainly glad you could make the
trip today. We really do appreciate it.

187
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,879
I'd like to spend time
getting to know you,

188
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,133
getting a bit more information
than what we shared over the phone.

189
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,468
Getting to know both of you,
what's your life like,

190
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,554
what's your relationship like...

191
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,139
It's good.

192
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,308
- It's good? That's one good step.
- Straight to the point there.

193
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,977
How long have the two of you
been together?

194
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,478
- Three years.
- Three years?

195
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,148
We're engaged to be engaged
after she graduates.

196
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,985
- And your jobs? Both your jobs?
- I'm a student.

197
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,155
I'm an English major,
hoping to be a teacher soon.

198
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:24,993
I don't know where yet.
Micah is a day trader.

199
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,870
- Yeah.
- How about your health?

200
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,291
- We're in good health.
- And no medications involved?

201
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,584
- No.
- OK.

202
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,712
More often than not,
things that you've shared with me

203
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,551
can be explained away by simple things,
like squeaky houses or rattling pipes

204
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,180
or you know,
some normal thing that's going on

205
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,726
that has people more freaked because
they're under a high degree of stress.

206
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:54,439
So... So this...
let's call it a haunting,

207
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,025
has happened to you
before moving into this house.

208
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:02,280
Yes. It started when I was eight.

209
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,784
I, you know,
I lived with my family, of course,

210
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,662
and shared a room with my
younger sister, Christi. She was five.

211
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:15,752
And at that time we both, you know,
experienced whatever it was.

212
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,755
We had... I would feel the breathing
and it would wake me up,

213
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,549
and I would wake her up.
And I would see the...

214
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:28,765
I guess you'd call it like the, like
just a mass, like the shadowy figure

215
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,517
that would be at the foot of my bed.

216
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,061
It was always at the foot of my bed,
never at the foot of her bed.

217
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,396
- But she did see it.
- She saw it also?

218
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,983
Absolutely. And we were
both absolutely terrified.

219
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,570
- OK.
- I mean, you know, couldn't even move.

220
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:46,407
You know, you just...
It was just... It was horrifying.

221
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,661
And we would just pray.
Please, please let it just go away.

222
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,454
And then, eventually, it would.

223
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,290
So this happened for a while
in our first house.

224
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,086
And then we...
There was a fire. We managed...

225
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,965
Everyone got out, no one was hurt,
thank God... Thank goodness.

226
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,718
But we lost everything.
So we moved.

227
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,680
Was it ever determined
what caused the fire?

228
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,515
- No.
- OK.

229
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:15,270
And I... You know, I'm not saying
it had to do with the haunting stuff.

230
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,022
I'm not saying that at all.
I don't know what it was.

231
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,609
Did the fire department do any
investigation of the causes of the fire?

232
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,028
I don't know if there was
a criminal investigation,

233
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:28,283
but I know that they tried to figure out
what was the cause, and they couldn't.

234
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,618
- OK.
- It wasn't electrical or anything,

235
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,620
you know, simple like that.

236
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:36,040
So then, from the time you were
eight years old until now,

237
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,294
have you experienced this periodically
over the ensuing years?

238
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,089
Yes. From 13 on it's happened,
it's happened periodically.

239
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,676
Over the past few weeks
things have started happening again.

240
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,346
So when you tell me that it's moved
from where you were living

241
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,765
when you were eight,
again when you were living

242
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,476
someplace else when you were 13,
and now here,

243
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,604
it seems to me that's what
we're dealing with.

244
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,982
Something that's
basically connected to you.

245
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,111
These lights have been flickering,
these ones that are in the ceiling.

246
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,324
We've had water from the faucets
turn on and off unexplainably.

247
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,825
- OK.
- Or we'll come down.

248
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,994
Not turn on and off,
but we'll come down and it'll be on.

249
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,873
We've heard banging on the walls,
scratching sounds,

250
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,835
like, you know, like dragging down
the wall kind of scratches.

251
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,087
Most of the activity is in here,
isn't it?

252
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,923
Yes. The vast majority of it.

253
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,342
I've heard whispering.

254
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:32,680
Sometimes I can't understand it,
sometimes it's saying my name.

255
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,515
Oh, so it specifically
calls to your name?

256
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,851
- It has before.
- You've heard this too, Micah?

257
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,437
Well, I've heard weird noises.

258
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,607
I haven't really heard anyone
say Katie's name, except for me.

259
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,317
That might've been me in my sleep.

260
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:48,237
I can tell the difference between you
saying "Katie" from over there in bed

261
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:52,700
and something right here
whispering distinctly in my ear.

262
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:57,538
Yeah, so, look. And I got like a
FireWire going into my laptop, you know,

263
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,208
we can record all night what...
You want to take this?

264
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,378
Got the tripod, wide angle lens,
get the whole room

265
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,006
EVP recorder, just to catch any sounds.

266
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,217
So you'll go to bed
and have the light on

267
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,636
and have the camera going
as you're going to bed.

268
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,640
- Is this, do you do this all the time?
- We've just started with the camera.

269
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,725
Our extra bathroom right there.

270
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,937
Guest bedrooms.
Lights flickering in here.

271
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,815
Is there something we can do
to make the stuff happen?

272
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,359
- To get it on tape?
- I've told him I don't want to

273
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,903
mess with that. I didn't
want him to get the camera.

274
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,531
These hauntings,
they feed off of negative energy.

275
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,992
So if there is something negative
going on here,

276
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,786
it will help spur on the haunting.

277
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,414
You know the entity
may feed off of that.

278
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,209
You shouldn't let your mother come
over anymore. She's really mean.

279
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,627
Stop joking, Micah.

280
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,386
My area of expertise
is dealing with ghosts.

281
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,263
That's what I've built my career on,

282
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,349
helping people get in touch
with people who have died.

283
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,393
Communicating with ghosts.

284
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,895
The spirits of dead human beings.

285
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,023
A demon is something different.

286
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,609
That's an entity that relates
to something that is non-human.

287
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,777
OK.

288
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,697
A lot of debate and discussion
about what that could be,

289
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,282
but it's not a person.

290
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,950
- OK.
- OK?

291
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,786
Dealing with demons is not my area.

292
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,248
I'm very uncomfortable with it,
and I'll tell you, quite frankly,

293
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,125
I sense there's something going on
in this house.

294
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,754
You cannot run from this.
It'll follow you.

295
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,214
It may lay dormant for years.

296
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,051
Something may trigger it to get...
become more active,

297
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,472
and it will, over time,
reach out to communicate with you.

298
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,141
OK, I want to give you the name
of Dr. Johann Averies.

299
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,312
He's a colleague. He's a demonologist,
he specializes in this sort of thing.

300
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,605
- He's in Los Angeles.
- OK.

301
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,650
All right, check this out. What if
we just get this Ouija board, right?

302
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,654
We find out what it wants, then we
give it what it wants and then... gone.

303
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,657
Because what it probably wants is Katie.

304
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,994
And if you do pick up a board
and try to play games with it,

305
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,247
the entity will sense that
you're trying to communicate with it,

306
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,167
and that's opening the door,
inviting it in.

307
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,295
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah, I'm with you.

308
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,675
I hope so. You're gonna be fine. OK?

309
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,677
Glad to hear you say that.

310
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,680
Thank you so much for coming.

311
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,518
I will definitely give
Dr. Averies a call.

312
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,687
- Have a very safe trip back.
- I will. Bye-bye, both of you.

313
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,774
- Nice to meet you, bye.
- Later. What a fruit!

314
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,693
Do you think you could try not to be
completely rude to him?

315
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,447
I feel like it was good information,
like I'm not nuts.

316
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,950
I feel like at least
we're doing something.

317
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,868
I'm gonna call that guy tomorrow.

318
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,161
What guy?

319
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,124
- Dr. Johann Averies?
- That demon guy?

320
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,875
- Don't laugh at him.
- No, don't.

321
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,545
Seriously, don't call the guy, OK?
That's insane.

322
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,006
- He said to call him tomorrow.
- Babe. Don't call the guy.

323
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,884
No, promise me you're not gonna
call that guy. Please?

324
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,886
- Want me to promise?
- I talked with the one dude,

325
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,472
I'm not putting up with like a team,
a legion of...

326
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,765
- OK.
- ...Jesus freaks.

327
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,560
- If it gets worse I'm gonna call him.
- All right.

328
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,605
Yeah. You sound way better
when you're brushing your teeth.

329
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,776
Have a little extracurricular
activity with this camera?

330
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,444
Not with this camera on us, no.

331
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,655
OK, taking the camera off
for ten minutes.

332
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,906
Ten minutes, huh?

333
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,200
That's all I need.
I don't know about you.

334
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,120
Let's go to bed. Turn it off.

335
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,914
All right. I'll set up
in the bedroom.

336
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,251
- Turn it off!
- Katie is in the bathroom.

337
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,589
- Turn it off. Turn it off!
- Hi, Katie.

338
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,549
I want to pee! Turn it off.

339
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,802
Dr. Johann. I am Dr. Johann.

340
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,138
- OK, I'm about to pee.
- I'm a demonologist.

341
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,348
Go away. I can't hear you,
can't hear you.

342
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,476
I'm here to save you from the demons.

343
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,688
Come to bed.

344
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:55,943
I will! Just let me turn
this off... Play time?

345
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,112
Wait!

346
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,117
- Excuse me.
- What?

347
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,953
- The camera's not off.
- It's off. That's the standby light.

348
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,664
That's not the standby light.
That's the record light.

349
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,875
- Don't lie to me.
- All right.

350
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,797
I think that probably was illegal
in Kentucky and another 12 states.

351
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,509
This girl is a wild animal.

352
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,347
What time you
getting up?

353
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,557
Don't know,
six o'clock or so.

354
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,810
Did you set
your alarm?

355
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,506
Sleep good?

356
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,882
Is that the video?

357
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,801
I was looking at the footage
from last night.

358
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,304
Check it out.
This is about 2:1 0 in the morning.

359
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,556
- The doors...
- A minute.

360
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,724
You got it?

361
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,561
The doors and windows all over the
house are closed. I just checked them.

362
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,732
The flowers are not moving.
But something else is.

363
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,486
- The door's fricking moving by itself.
- Oh, my God.

364
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,574
And it's not over. Check it out.
It moves again.

365
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,247
- Oh, Micah, that is...
- That's impossible.

366
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,585
- I told you this was a good idea.
- Wow.

367
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,838
You think you can get that ghost back?

368
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,965
- Think I can do what?
- Get the ghost back.

369
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,301
Get us some more interesting...
you know.

370
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,763
I'm not interested in that.
I just want him to go away.

371
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,859
Oh, Micah!
Oh, my God.

372
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,280
What are you doing?
Come here! Come here right now!

373
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,448
What?

374
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,575
It's right there.
It's right there! Get it!

375
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,787
Get rid of it. Please.

376
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,414
You scream like that for a spider?

377
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,501
- Oh, God.
- Jesus.

378
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,712
- Did you go get the camera first?
- Yeah.

379
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,507
I thought it was a ghost
or something like real scary...

380
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,301
I'm nearly losing my mind
and you grab the camera.

381
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,137
Hey, little friend! What's your name?

382
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:14,392
Can I turn the camera off?
OK. I need to not be around you.

383
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,437
- All right. We're going.
- Straight outside. OK.

384
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,819
Hey, you out here?

385
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,579
Hey, tell me what the point of this was.

386
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,877
Was part of your master plan
just to move the door?

387
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,172
Or are you just doing random shit?

388
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,594
Well. Basically, it could be two things:

389
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,056
It could be a ghost,
or it could be a demon.

390
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,017
Dr. Fredrichs said
that it wasn't a ghost.

391
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,769
- And whatever it is...
- I'm going by the evidence.

392
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,981
I'm doing my research
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

393
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,234
Well, whatever it is that's
following me, it doesn't feel...

394
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,612
It doesn't feel human.

395
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,701
It feels like a monster.
I mean, like it wants to hurt me.

396
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,203
Well, that sounds
actually like a demon.

397
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,915
- Yeah, that's what he said.
- Ghosts are spirits of human beings.

398
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,709
Yeah. It's definitely not human.

399
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,588
Then maybe you're right,
which is bad, 'cause demons suck!

400
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,966
Basically, they're these
malevolent, evil spirits

401
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:34,889
that only exist to cause pain and
commit evil for their own amusement.

402
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:39,518
It's pretty creepy. I mean, they
stalk people for years, like decades.

403
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,772
They're sometimes really intelligent in
the way they do things to freak you out.

404
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,942
So this could be
a really rare phenomenon,

405
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,694
and it's cool we got it on tape.

406
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,614
I'm surprisingly not as excited as you,

407
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,158
considering I'm the one
that's being terrified.

408
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,285
It's all good. We'll take care of it.

409
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,330
I understand that
this stuff is new to you,

410
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:05,252
and exciting in some ways,
so I get your whole filming thing.

411
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,965
But it isn't new to me,

412
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:14,637
and I think this thing
could be very dangerous.

413
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:18,349
So I just... I just want you
to know that as things get...

414
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,643
...things progress
or get worse in any way,

415
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,562
I don't want to mess with the camera.
Don't want to make it mad.

416
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,357
I understand where you're
coming from, just remember

417
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,776
you didn't exactly warn me
about this stuff

418
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,819
- before we moved in together.
- I know.

419
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,948
So I think I have
a little bit of say in what we do.

420
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,450
I get that, honestly.
But what was I supposed to say?

421
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,911
On our first date,
"There's a demon that has been foll..."

422
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,248
No, but maybe on our
1 5th date or our 30th date

423
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,458
or when we decided to live together,

424
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,294
that might've been
a good thing to bring up.

425
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,215
Here.

426
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:06,814
All right. The windows are locked,
doors are locked, alarm is on.

427
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,984
Anything gets in here,
we're gonna know about it.

428
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,571
I don't think it cares about
alarms and locked doors.

429
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,533
It can go wherever it wants,
it can do whatever it wants.

430
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,993
How do you know?

431
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,787
Whatever's happening, it's already here.

432
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,082
All right.

433
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,534
What is this?

434
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,329
What's the matter?

435
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,124
I just...
I just had a nightmare.

436
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,631
I'm sorry,
did I scare you?

437
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,508
It's all right,
don't worry about it.

438
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,386
- Oh, my God.
- You OK?

439
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,596
- Yeah.
- You sure?

440
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,681
My head.

441
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,936
Did you hear that?

442
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,397
- I'm going down.
- No, no, no, Micah!

443
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,565
Micah, no!

444
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,902
Micah,
don't leave me here.

445
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,070
Don't leave me here.

446
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,988
Take this.

447
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,577
Where do you think that came from?

448
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,248
- Micah!
- Is anyone down here?

449
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,561
- This all you got?
- Oh, Micah, stop!

450
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,232
Please don't do that.
Oh, baby, come on.

451
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,327
You OK, baby?

452
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,789
I'm OK.

453
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,959
- You sure?
- I'm still creeped out.

454
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,628
- Hey, girls?
- No, but you know what?

455
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:38,173
- If you can just show me...
- Hello! Excuse me!

456
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,758
I know it's bead time,

457
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,344
but I have a little something
I want to show you guys.

458
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,597
Can it wait? We're having
very intense girl time right now,

459
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,475
and we cannot be interrupted
by Micah and his camera.

460
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,645
- Thank you, OK. I understand.
- I need a little break from...

461
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,772
What the fuck!
I'm trying to show you guys something.

462
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
Hey! You be sweet.

463
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:59,486
All right. This is the tape
from the digital audio recorder

464
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,821
I set up in the bedroom.

465
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,325
This is the tape from about
ten seconds before we woke up.

466
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,169
What the hell was that?

467
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:19,006
I listened to it 50 times.
It's not saying anything.

468
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:23,635
It's not a language that I recognize,
it's not a dog, it's not, like,

469
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,180
noise from the street,
it's not any kind of

470
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,682
electrical interference
that I recognize, so...

471
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,601
- Oh, God!
- What I figure it is...

472
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,686
I think the thing is
right in the bedroom.

473
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,482
This thing wants to communicate.

474
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,818
So, I figure I'm gonna go out
and get a Ouija board...

475
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,195
No!

476
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,363
I don't want to know
what this thing has to say.

477
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,200
- I want it to leave us alone.
- Trust me. Bad idea.

478
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,286
He specifically said,
"Don't do anything to antagonize or..."

479
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,580
- Whatever it is.
- Sorry I told you about it.

480
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,124
You're going to use a Ouija
board and invite whatever it is in,

481
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,668
- and it's not going to go away.
- Let me do my thing.

482
00:29:56,836 --> 00:30:01,131
The camera is your thing.
You do a Ouija board, there's no more.

483
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,468
Nothing. Promise me.
Micah, promise me, please!

484
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,554
Fine! I promise you
I won't buy a Ouija board.

485
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,722
- OK?
- Thank you.

486
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,391
Hey, Micah, smile.

487
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,149
Hey, we haven't had anything
interesting happen in a while!

488
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,194
- Micah?
- You scared?

489
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,155
What you got?

490
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,241
Put the camera away,
we're going to bed.

491
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,034
- Go back to sleep.
- Come on.

492
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,330
- Hey! Don't antagonize...
- What you got? I'm calling you out!

493
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:37,292
Hey! Hey, that's enough! Micah! Come on.

494
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,255
Your demon's worthless.
You're worthless!

495
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,090
You got nothing.

496
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,634
- Put the camera away.
- OK.

497
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,038
What's up?

498
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,875
I just thought
I heard something.

499
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,257
What?
What'd you hear?

500
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,718
Just a thud.

501
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,849
- A thud? Where?
- Maybe downstairs.

502
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,534
Fuck.

503
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,504
Where are you going?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

504
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,758
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

505
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,228
Micah, wait, wait, wait, please.

506
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,605
Where'd you go?

507
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:26,860
I'm right here. I'm over here, babe.
I'm over here. Over here.

508
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,659
Oh, my God.

509
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,703
Hear that?

510
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,707
Oh, God.

511
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,381
- You OK, baby?
- Yeah.

512
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,222
Oh, God.

513
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,307
It looks like it's gone now,
whatever it was.

514
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,600
OK, come on.

515
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,561
That's video proof
of that noise, though.

516
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,290
Do you hear that?

517
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,931
Hold on.

518
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,873
You hear that?

519
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,167
Yeah, I do.
I don't know what that is.

520
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,881
This is really
good stuff, Katie.

521
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,258
I'm telling you. This is, this is the...

522
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:18,889
I hope that guy... it, whatever,
shows us a little more action.

523
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,850
- This is grade-A shit.
- I don't think we should be

524
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:26,354
messing with this. This is why it
scares me, you don't take it seriously.

525
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,982
I take it seriously.
I think it's pretty...

526
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,193
You have a camera in my face
in the bathroom.

527
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,653
You look beautiful
in the morning, by the way.

528
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,697
Maybe we shouldn't have the camera.

529
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:41,495
Hello. This is really
golden shit. Come on.

530
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:47,501
Not an option, at this point,
with all that cool stuff going on.

531
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,503
- Cool?
- Or disturbing.

532
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,173
- Are you not scared?
- It's... it's a little bizarre.

533
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,010
But we have it documented,
it's gonna be fine, OK?

534
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:02,182
Sounded like it was, like, sounds coming
from the wall or ceiling or something.

535
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:07,229
- Or the floor.
- Floor? Y'think?

536
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,899
Well, whatever it was... Oh, God!

537
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,070
Like if someone were to drop
something really, really big and heavy.

538
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,448
Like what? Like someone
picked the couch up or something?

539
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,370
You know, that kind of stuff
didn't happen to me before the camera.

540
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,082
- Before what?
- Before the camera.

541
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,210
- That has nothing to do with it.
- It's getting worse.

542
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,838
It wasn't that bad.
It was like a little loud.

543
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,423
That was my inner child being scared.

544
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,803
I'm fine, thanks. All right?

545
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,851
EVP Experiment Number One.

546
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,311
Is there anyone here?

547
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,399
Where did you come from?

548
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,655
You have something to say?
In English, this time?

549
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,995
Would you be happier
talking with the Ouija board?

550
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,794
What is your quest?
What is your favorite color?

551
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,214
Where did you come from?

552
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:24,097
You have something to say?
In English, this time?

553
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,267
It's got nothing to say, huh?

554
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,228
Would you be happier
talking with the Ouija board?

555
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,440
Whoa, what the hell.

556
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,444
Is that you grunting?

557
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:44,117
Was it like one for "Yes", two for "No"?

558
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,079
Yeah? Nice.

559
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,169
Yeah. Let's watch a movie.
I don't want to go to sleep yet.

560
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,088
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm scared.

561
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,301
- Yeah.
- Come on, put the camera off.

562
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,410
Katie.

563
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,254
Katie!

564
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,759
You down here? Babe?

565
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,152
Fuck.

566
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,799
Katie?

567
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,973
Babe!

568
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,770
What are you doing out here?

569
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,149
- Hey. Hey.
- What?

570
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,985
It's freezing out here.
What are you doing with no clothes on?

571
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:09,572
- I'm fine.
- Come on.

572
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,991
No. I don't want to go in.

573
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,827
Just leave me alone.

574
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,329
- Are you OK, baby?
- I'm fine.

575
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,541
- Come on.
- No.

576
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,296
You just want to sit out here
in the swing in the middle of the night,

577
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:30,051
- while it's freezing?
- Yes. Go away.

578
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,515
I'll stay out here with you.
I'm gonna get some blankets, OK?

579
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,230
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is going on?

580
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,982
Ridiculous.

581
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,401
Sitting out in the cold.

582
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,197
Fuck is that?

583
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,662
Hey! Who's there?

584
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,957
Katie, come inside!

585
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,136
What the fuck is going on? Come out!

586
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,907
Fuck!

587
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,827
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

588
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,371
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What do you mean?

589
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,585
I just heard noises up here
and I came in to get a blanket

590
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,504
- 'cause you're on the swing...
- What?

591
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,423
...for some reason.
There's all this stomping up here...

592
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,259
- Come back to bed. You woke me up.
- And the TV is on.

593
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,931
Jesus. I don't know
what the fuck is going on anymore.

594
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,058
- I'm cold.
- Why are you crazy like this?

595
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,023
So you don't remember any of this?

596
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,859
No. I mean...

597
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,986
You don't remember getting out of bed?

598
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,114
You don't remember standing there
like a total weirdo?

599
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,324
Hey.

600
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,284
I'm saying, like...

601
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,955
- Oh, my goodness.
- And this? You don't...

602
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,456
Were you sleepwalking?

603
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:27,085
- What was going through your mind?
- I don't know! I wasn't... I...

604
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,839
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

605
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,508
What do you remember from this?

606
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,802
- Were you dreaming?
- I don't remember anything.

607
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,347
I remember standing in the doorway
and you pointing a camera at me.

608
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:43,226
And you were all freaked out.
I don't, I don't remember standing here.

609
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,186
You went downstairs, sat in the swing.

610
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,981
I went to get you a blanket
'cause you refused to come back.

611
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,066
Fast forward it
to where I go downstairs.

612
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,778
I'm freaking leaving the room. Where...

613
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,198
You went outside and sat on the swing.

614
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,742
And I went inside to bring you a blanket

615
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,455
'cause you refused to leave in this
catatonic, weird state you were in.

616
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,958
- I don't know...
- Wait, wait. Did I talk to you?

617
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,793
I wouldn't call it talking.

618
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:13,631
But I come upstairs and there's
like footsteps, and the TV's on.

619
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,551
So that's...

620
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,389
Well, maybe this kind of thing's
been happening for a long time

621
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,600
and you just never knew about it.

622
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:29,147
I don't remember anything. I know that
I had nightmares all night and that...

623
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,356
What?

624
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,193
I didn't want to talk about it.

625
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,529
They were gruesome.
Let's leave it at that.

626
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,240
It's trying to scare us.
It scared you and me...

627
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,201
- It's working! I'm scared!
- Just got to stay strong.

628
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,331
And not let it get to you,
not let it get to us.

629
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:52,962
Look, bringing in somebody else,
some exorcist or whatever,

630
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,215
lot of times it just gets worse.
You don't want it to get worse.

631
00:43:56,383 --> 00:44:01,429
- No, I don't.
- No. Me neither.

632
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,563
Yeah, all right,
you little fucker.

633
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:14,233
Got something to say?
Now's your chance.

634
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,237
Katie! Where are you?

635
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,906
I'll be down.
Hang on a second.

636
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,376
I can't wait to
get out of this house,

637
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,420
go out and hang out
with my boyfriend.

638
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,965
All right, we got,
like, ten minutes.

639
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,593
What in the hell
are you doing, Micah?

640
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,970
- Come on, help me.
- What are you doing?

641
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,764
- I'm gonna talk to it.
- Look at me!

642
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,932
I told you I was...

643
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,934
You promised me
you weren't gonna...

644
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,436
Don't you look at me like that.
You promised me

645
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,021
you weren't gonna mess
with that.

646
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,856
No! I promised you

647
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,733
I wasn't gonna buy
a Ouija board.

648
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:56,901
I didn't buy
a Ouija board.

649
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,820
You knew exactly
what I meant!

650
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,113
I borrowed
a Ouija board.

651
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,448
How dare you? You knew
exactly what I meant!

652
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,450
I said don't mess with that
because it scared me,

653
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,119
and what do you do?
You go out and get

654
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,954
the best looking fucking
Ouija board I've ever seen,

655
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,747
and you put it in the middle
of our living room?

656
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,999
- Explain that to me!
- I borrowed it.

657
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,710
You know, I don't care
what you did.

658
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,962
You're gonna throw it away.
We're gonna leave.

659
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,338
- Katie...
- There's no more camera,

660
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,382
there's no more nothing.
I don't want to hear it.

661
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,259
- I don't even want to hear it.
- Katie.

662
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,927
No, don't "Katie" me.
I'm leaving

663
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,513
and you're either coming
with me or you're not.

664
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,975
- Chill it, babe!
- I don't want to hear it.

665
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,425
Take your shoes off
and go to bed...

666
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,385
What?

667
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,221
What'd you do?
What'd you do, Micah?

668
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,181
Look at me!
What'd you do?

669
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,558
I didn't do shit, babe.
Look...

670
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,647
I cannot fucking
believe you, Micah.

671
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,361
I am finished. No more
fucking camera, nothing.

672
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,529
I'll take care of this.

673
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,614
If you're not gonna do it,
then I will.

674
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:14,789
Looks like someone drew something on it.

675
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,127
I don't know. Hey, Katie?

676
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,712
What?

677
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,258
Can you come down here
and help me figure this out, please?

678
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,093
Sorry?

679
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,055
I think this thing left a message.
On the Ouija board.

680
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,771
I don't give a fuck what that thing
says on the Ouija board!

681
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,566
Babe...

682
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,611
Katie! Look...

683
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:51,909
- Kate. Hello. Hey.
- Micah, get the fuck out!

684
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,873
- I don't want to look at that!
- Chill!

685
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,501
- Look, this is not the time for this.
- Get out!

686
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,671
Get out!

687
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,845
I think she's pissed. That's not good.

688
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:18,644
Hey, Katie? Katie? Hello?

689
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:22,481
- Look, I know you're pissed, but...
- Do we have any lemon?

690
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,989
What do I have to do?
Just tell me what I have to do.

691
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,325
You have to turn off the fucking camera.

692
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,660
The camera's... Fuck.
Forget the camera, OK?

693
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,631
I swear to abide
by Katie's

694
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:50,843
rules and regulations
of camera use...

695
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,056
...and other things.
Whatever.

696
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,390
Is that good enough
for you?

697
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,893
I think it needs to be
a little more sincere.

698
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:03,731
I...

699
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,692
I swear to abide
by Katie's

700
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,029
rules and regulations
of camera use

701
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,491
and to not
offend this entity,

702
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,618
or whatever it is,
in any way,

703
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,162
shape, or form,
so help me God.

704
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,707
And I promise not to
betray Katie's trust.

705
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,377
And I promise not to
betray Katie's trust.

706
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,545
- Is there anything else?
- That'll be it.

707
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,091
Good.

708
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,009
Fuck.

709
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,681
Can I at least get
a kiss for that? Please?

710
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,227
Goodnight.

711
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,207
Katie.
Do you want to know

712
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,126
what happened to
the Ouija board?

713
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,921
I saw the tape,
you know.

714
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,094
I just want to
forget about it, OK?

715
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,521
Let's go to sleep.

716
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,702
I think I found something pretty cool,

717
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,329
and I'd like you to help me
figure it out.

718
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:47,084
So, sit down. No? Or stand up.

719
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:50,129
I caught on camera everything
that happened after we left.

720
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,924
- When the cursor was moving by itself.
- OK.

721
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,302
I'm trying to figure out what it said.

722
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,140
I couldn't figure out
exactly what it said,

723
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,309
but there's a lot of possibilities.

724
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,480
Do you know anyone
named Edina or Diane?

725
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,692
Could be Nadine, without two N's... No.

726
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,614
- No.
- All right. Well, I'll work on it.

727
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,199
You know, it may...

728
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:21,660
It could be this thing's fucking
with us and it doesn't mean anything.

729
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:25,247
Or it could be... so many possibilities,
I mean, I could be wrong.

730
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,540
I don't know.

731
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,293
I don't really...
I don't really care what it means.

732
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:32,088
You're done playing with it.
I want it out of the house.

733
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,133
We haven't gone a week
without something happening.

734
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,260
- That's crazy.
- I can't...

735
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,514
- What're you guys talking about?
- I'm at my... Just everything.

736
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,517
- Come stay with me.
- You remember, it's not the house.

737
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,686
It's me. You know,
wherever I go, it goes.

738
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,606
What am I gonna do, go to your house,
mess things up for you?

739
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:54,193
- I got a plan. Don't worry about it.
- Micah, what's your plan?

740
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,363
- I got a plan.
- What? What're you gonna do?

741
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,824
- You know what...
- Don't worry about it, OK?

742
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:04,328
- All right? So.
- OK, here's the compromise...

743
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,496
What?

744
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,582
You can have your powder,
you can do your little experiment.

745
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,043
If it doesn't work,
if it doesn't help us,

746
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,380
I'm calling the demonologist
and we're getting this taken care of.

747
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,633
- Yeah. Deal.
- Can you look at me and not the camera?

748
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,386
No. Deal. All right, so.

749
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,555
- Happy, yeah?
- Yeah.

750
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,890
- Deal.
- All right.

751
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,059
Is that thing on?

752
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:31,397
Yes. And exactly
what is this gonna prove?

753
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,067
Well, if anything walks through here,

754
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,902
it's gonna leave
a pretty good footprint.

755
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:40,406
OK. I think we've pretty much
established something's happening.

756
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,117
All right. So tomorrow,
I'm making the call.

757
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:46,036
You can have your powder.
You can clean it up tomorrow.

758
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:49,748
Take a deep breath,
pop a pill, it's fine.

759
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,168
- Excuse me?
- Figure out what we're dealing with.

760
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,627
- Micah!
- OK?

761
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:57,381
- Then we can go crazy.
- Pop a pill, my ass.

762
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,799
Does that look good to you?

763
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,594
It looks like our floor
is covered with powder, yes.

764
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,929
- I'll clean it up.
- All right.

765
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,681
That's a thing of beauty.

766
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,100
- Hey.
- Yeah.

767
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,478
I've been doing my research.
I'm taking care of this.

768
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:15,816
Nobody comes in my house,
fucks with my girlfriend,

769
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,943
gets away with it. Here.

770
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,111
What do you want
to do about it?

771
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,404
Want to call in
the demon guy?

772
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,114
- Yes! Exactly!
- Call an exorcist?

773
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,282
I want to
take care of this!

774
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,783
Get a quack to tell us
what to do?

775
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,952
This is my house,
you're my girlfriend.

776
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,330
I'm gonna fucking
solve the problem.

777
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:32,291
- OK?
- OK.

778
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:36,378
Babe. Just have
a little faith, huh?

779
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,966
This is it.

780
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,427
What's it?

781
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:48,265
The powder is the last.
The last thing.

782
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,601
Tomorrow I'm gonna
make the call.

783
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,311
Too cute to be talking.

784
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,946
Did you hear that?

785
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,158
Oh, shit!

786
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:52,496
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

787
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,006
You know what?

788
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,262
There's footsteps in,
but there's no footsteps out.

789
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,722
Oh, God!

790
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,060
- Don't leave me in here.
- Turn on the light, baby.

791
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,898
Let's just get out and go downstairs.

792
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,609
It's still here. Let's go!

793
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:28,699
It finally can't run. Where is it?

794
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:29,908
What?

795
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,288
The prints stop over here.

796
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,750
Micah, this could be a trap.
Please, let's go!

797
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,589
Oh, my God!

798
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,091
Did you do that?

799
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:56,185
You didn't... You didn't, did you?
Tell me you opened that.

800
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,772
Of course not.
What the hell is that?

801
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,236
You're not going up...
You're not going up there.

802
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,197
Oh, you're not going up there.

803
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:12,743
I'm not going in there. Just gonna...

804
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,037
- Just gonna look.
- No, you're not!

805
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,791
I gotta go check it out.
I'm getting the ladder.

806
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,627
OK. It's all set up.

807
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:26,507
Micah, I really don't want you
to go up there. Please.

808
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,968
I'm not going in there.
I'm just gonna look.

809
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:32,846
You have no idea what's up there.
You've no idea!

810
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,390
I know.

811
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,772
Oh, Micah.

812
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,484
Give me the camera. Yeah.

813
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:49,196
- Be careful.
- All right, if something goes wrong,

814
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,657
I'm gonna throw you the camera
and jump out, OK?

815
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,078
Do you see anything?

816
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,922
Micah, I don't want to
be down here by myself.

817
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,298
I'll be right back.

818
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,055
What the fuck is that?

819
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,934
There's something over there
stuck in the stuff.

820
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,145
Oh, my God, Micah,
come back down! Come on.

821
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,189
Micah, please, come on.

822
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,651
Now this...

823
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,279
Hold on. Here.

824
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,448
- What?
- Just take the camera.

825
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,949
OK. Come on.

826
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:40,456
- I'll hold the ladder. Come down.
- Something up there, I got to look.

827
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,749
Micah! Oh, God.

828
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,379
Micah, please be careful.

829
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,799
Are you OK?

830
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:56,096
Micah, answer me! Micah. Micah!

831
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:59,016
- I'm fine.
- I'm com... Ah, thank God.

832
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,102
Fuck.

833
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,106
I found this up there.

834
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:11,904
No. No, no, no, no.
Let me see that.

835
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,910
- What're you talking about?
- This is our old house.

836
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,580
What in the hell is this
doing in the attic?

837
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,166
I thought all that stuff burned down.

838
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:28,045
There's no way. There is no way
you found that in our attic!

839
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,255
There is no way that that even exists!

840
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,509
I haven't seen that picture
in 1 5 years.

841
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:38,972
That makes no sense.
That makes no sense at all.

842
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,359
You OK, babe?

843
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,279
Would you turn the light off, please.

844
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,323
Sorry.

845
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,329
Where was it when you found it?

846
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,124
It was over our bed.

847
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,843
- I'm gonna go clean up that stuff.
- OK.

848
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:21,056
I don't have any idea
if I'm gonna get to class today.

849
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,314
Oh, God, I'm so tired.

850
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,858
Why are you filming me?
I'm just making coffee.

851
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,862
I'm actually sick of this.

852
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,410
I think we could both use
a little more sleep.

853
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:46,164
I think I could use a new life.
I'm so tired of this.

854
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,087
- Take a look at this.
- Take a look at what?

855
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,799
I lightened up the footage
from last night.

856
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,759
You can see the footsteps.

857
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,181
Oh, my God.

858
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,104
- So?
- What?

859
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,564
What are you gonna do?

860
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,029
I don't know yet.

861
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,489
Well, I do. We're calling Dr. Averies.

862
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,492
You've had your camera work,
your powder on the floor,

863
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,453
and it's just gotten worse, OK?

864
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:29,708
We should've done this two weeks ago.
We're calling him. Today.

865
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,171
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Let's talk about this first.

866
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,841
Now, I'm in control,
think I'm making progress.

867
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:41,219
No, you haven't been having
progress and you're not in control!

868
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,513
It is in control.
If you think you're in control,

869
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,349
- you're an idiot!
- Hey! Stay cool.

870
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:46,892
Not a single thing
you've done has helped.

871
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,311
And I'm sorry, I don't mean
to burst your bubble,

872
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,105
but the camera hasn't helped,
the footprints haven't helped.

873
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:55,108
Think that thing would've left
footprints if it didn't want to?

874
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:58,153
No! It did it because it wanted to.
It wanted you to find my photo.

875
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,656
It can be anywhere.
It hears what we're saying now.

876
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:04,368
- Hey! How the fuck do you know?
- You are absolutely powerless!

877
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,745
That's not true at all and you know it.

878
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,372
Well, get over it!

879
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:17,047
Well, I called Dr. Averies
and he's gone.

880
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,591
Didn't know what else to do,
so I called Dr. Fredrichs.

881
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,510
I know you don't love him, but I did.

882
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:25,639
And he's coming back tomorrow.
That was as soon as he could get here.

883
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,433
So maybe if we make it till then,
we could hold off...

884
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,019
- We'll make it till then!
- I'm just saying that we could just...

885
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,940
- "Make it till then." God!
- We could hold out, we'll be OK,

886
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:40,946
- and maybe tomorrow he'll help us.
- Fucking people! Ridiculous.

887
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,819
Fuck!

888
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:21,987
What happened?

889
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,239
What're you doing? Micah.

890
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,366
What're you doing? What'd you hear?

891
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,285
Something out there.

892
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,788
- Fuck!
- Oh, God.

893
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,039
Goddamn it!

894
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,917
Baby, come here. Please don't go...

895
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:40,630
Please, just stay, please. Don't go.

896
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,717
I'm going out there and see...

897
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:47,387
Wait, Micah, don't go. Don't, please.

898
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,640
Please. Please don't open it.

899
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,520
Micah, come on. Come on.

900
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:58,774
Right now. Come on. Micah.

901
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,198
Who's there?

902
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,787
- Baby, come on!
- You gonna fuck with us?

903
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:20,378
Micah, don't. Come on. Let's go.

904
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,047
Show yourself!

905
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,384
Come on, Micah. Let's go.
We've got to get out.

906
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,971
- Got a problem?
- Stop!

907
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,890
All right, hon, I'm sorry.

908
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,314
Micah...

909
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,449
Please let go of it.

910
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,579
Oh, it's scaring us.

911
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:56,998
Hey.

912
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,920
- Not gonna make a difference.
- I'm not going in that bedroom.

913
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,922
- Look...
- I'm not going in that bedroom.

914
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,424
- Oh, please, please...
- Baby, look, if it comes back...

915
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,718
No, downstairs. Let's just... Please.

916
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:13,390
Babe. It's not gonna make a difference.

917
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,183
- I can't...
- Come on.

918
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,769
I don't wanna be in here.
I don't wanna be even downstairs.

919
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,438
Please, please...
Please, please. Please.

920
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,649
All right.

921
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,699
What the hell is in here now?

922
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:36,121
I don't know if down here
is gonna be much better.

923
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:44,754
Micah. I don't want to be here.

924
01:04:56,642 --> 01:05:00,979
I think we should go upstairs.
Again. Come here.

925
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,374
Katie?

926
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,296
Babe?

927
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:38,725
You know, gotta get some sleep
once in a while.

928
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,853
I'm just scared.

929
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,566
I couldn't be in that room anymore.

930
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,864
I understand.

931
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,284
I can't even be in this house, Micah.

932
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:00,622
We can't even be in our house.

933
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,435
What the fuck is that?

934
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,278
I'll check the mirrors.

935
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:41,830
Our picture!

936
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,376
- What picture?
- That one, look!

937
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:53,299
Fuck! What the hell?

938
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:55,927
How come my face is scratched
and yours isn't?

939
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,096
Something's here.

940
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:02,308
- This is bullshit.
- It's here.

941
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:07,147
What's here? What?
What're you talking about?

942
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:12,277
I don't know. I feel it.
I feel it breathing on me.

943
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:18,199
Micah, come on! Come on! Please!

944
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,120
Fuckin'-A, man.

945
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,209
Fuckin'-A.

946
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:35,759
- Babe. Come downstairs.
- Jesus Christ.

947
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,260
Come on.

948
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,936
Has this shit happened
in the daytime before?

949
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:51,983
It's getting worse.

950
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:54,986
Fuck.

951
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:00,700
- Hey, baby, stop pacing, please.
- I'm sorry.

952
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,369
- It's making me nervous.
- Well, I'm nervous.

953
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:08,625
Katie, hi.

954
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,503
Hi, come in, please.
Thank you so much for coming back.

955
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,505
Oh, we've gotta follow up.
Micah, hi.

956
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,757
Yeah. We called Dr. Averies,
but he's gone.

957
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,718
Yes, he's out of the country.
He'll be back. He'll be... Wow.

958
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,929
- We need your help.
- This is overpowering.

959
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,348
- It's worse.
- Yes. It doesn't like that I'm here.

960
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:24,849
- I cannot help you.
- What?

961
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:27,644
I've got to get out of here. This thing
is aggravated by the fact that I'm here.

962
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,145
You can't leave us alone here.

963
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:31,147
Everybody calm down.
We need your help.

964
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:34,567
Well, I've got to tell you, I am not the
person to help you in this situation.

965
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,694
This is not my area of expertise.

966
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:39,697
Now, I think I'm doing more harm
being here than any good.

967
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:41,366
- What?
- Yes, I have got to leave.

968
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,243
Dr. Averies will be back in a few days.

969
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,620
When he gets here
he'll take care of your problems.

970
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,872
What should we do?
Should we leave?

971
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,374
Leaving won't help at all.

972
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,793
Let me see what I can do.
But I've got to leave this room now.

973
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,379
- This is no joke.
- I will help you.

974
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,464
- But I can't do this now.
- No, no, no, no!

975
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:58,299
You serious?

976
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,722
We'll take care of this ourselves, OK?

977
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,558
Katie?

978
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:10,854
Fuck.

979
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:27,620
I'm so fucking tired of this.

980
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:32,333
I know you are.

981
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:38,006
I don't want it to be like this.

982
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:08,930
- Micah! Micah, wake up.
- What's the matter?

983
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,975
I just...
I just felt him breathing.

984
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:15,853
Right there.
He was right there,

985
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,230
I felt him breathing.

986
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,070
What are you doing?

987
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,035
Where're you going?
Micah, come back!

988
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:32,203
I'm not going anywhere.

989
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:35,290
Chill. There's
nothing happening.

990
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:38,293
I know, I'm telling you.
I'm telling you.

991
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,460
I... Please.

992
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:43,214
OK, OK.
I won't leave you.

993
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:45,633
Don't you feel it?

994
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:49,721
I feel it, he's still here.

995
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:51,556
Something,
something's wrong.

996
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,059
Take a deep breath,
OK?

997
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,285
I can feel it watching me.

998
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,247
Right now.

999
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,375
Fuck. You're freaking me out, babe.

1000
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:21,711
- We have to do something.
- What?

1001
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:24,589
I don't know.
We've got to figure something out.

1002
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:28,176
- We have to...
- OK. OK, OK.

1003
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,344
I'll figure something out.

1004
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:32,430
I'll do some research.
There's gotta be some other options.

1005
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,142
OK.

1006
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:42,982
- Jesus.
- This is creepy.

1007
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,943
I knew something happened last night.

1008
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:51,157
Ah, shit.

1009
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:56,120
We've got to do something.
I can feel something's wrong.

1010
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,130
So I was doing some research,
just trying to figure out our options.

1011
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:08,966
- Right.
- I found this website.

1012
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:12,595
This chick, Diane, one of
the possibilities from the board?

1013
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,390
Yeah.

1014
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:18,976
All the same things happened to her
in the 60's that's happened to you.

1015
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,145
Wait. What do you mean
she has the same things?

1016
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:25,149
Like everything. You're eight years old
and like you had a house burning down,

1017
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:31,322
seeing shadows and whatever.
God knows. And she called an exorcist.

1018
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:33,950
Is that her?

1019
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,494
You're telling me there's
some girl from the 60's

1020
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,622
who had the exact same things
happen to her.

1021
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:44,919
Yeah. Down to a T. You say...
Maybe this thing is the same thing.

1022
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,965
It just jumped to you instead.
And that's just its m.o., or whatever.

1023
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:50,716
And he's trying to warn us,

1024
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:55,138
with this Ouija board, trying to tell us
to find this woman so we know...

1025
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:57,765
Wait. So what happened to her?
Is she OK?

1026
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:03,229
They tried to get rid of it,
sometimes that just pisses it off more.

1027
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:08,151
Before the exorcist got there,
she wasn't like this.

1028
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:11,654
She was just hearing voices
and having bad dreams.

1029
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:14,365
I'm trying to find some kind of reason

1030
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:17,785
this thing would pick you
after haunting her.

1031
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,704
I can't find anything.

1032
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,498
From what I've been reading,
these things are totally random.

1033
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:25,209
- There's just no reason. Like...
- How did she die?

1034
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:29,797
She's pretty.

1035
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:33,050
Now she is. I think this
thing's trying to warn us

1036
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:37,013
not to fuck with it.
I don't want to take a chance.

1037
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,308
Oh, God!

1038
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,270
There's no way that we're doing this.

1039
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,064
It's gone away on its own before.

1040
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:49,275
This is not worth the risk.

1041
01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:52,487
I'm gonna go lie down.

1042
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,996
Hey, Katie, I got a idea
about what we can do.

1043
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,915
Some more stuff. In fact...

1044
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:07,585
Would you please get away from me
with that camera? I'm trying to study.

1045
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,756
All right. I kinda want to talk
to you about this thing.

1046
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:15,092
Micah, please.
Will you give me five minutes?

1047
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:17,595
Go! Please!

1048
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:21,265
Hey, chill out! All right?
I'm trying to help this situation here.

1049
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,100
I have ideas I want to
talk to you about.

1050
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,728
OK, you and your
stupid camera are the problem.

1051
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,232
- What the fuck?!
- Just leave me alone.

1052
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:32,109
Will you stop
following me with the camera!

1053
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:35,905
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I didn't bring that thing to the house.

1054
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,199
- Well, don't do me any favors.
- You did!

1055
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:42,745
Thank you, Micah.
Thank you so much.

1056
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:46,040
Well, hang out with your
friend upstairs. I'll be down here.

1057
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,918
- Shut up!
- Whatever.

1058
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,220
Hey.

1059
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,477
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

1060
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:09,313
You didn't do anything wrong.

1061
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:12,400
It's not your fault.
Now listen to me, it's not your fault.

1062
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,735
You haven't done anything wrong.

1063
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,737
OK?

1064
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:48,519
Micah. Micah! Micah!

1065
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,855
Micah! Micah!

1066
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,815
- Katie!
- Micah!

1067
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,615
Let her go!

1068
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:08,247
Micah! Micah!

1069
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,292
Micah, make it stop!

1070
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:41,530
I don't care, I just want to go.
I just want to go.

1071
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:44,450
I can't... I can't,
I can't be here. I can't.

1072
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:46,702
Just, let's go. Please, let's go.

1073
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:49,580
Let's just go right now.
Let's get in the car and let's go.

1074
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:55,169
Yeah. All right, we're leaving.
I'll get us a hotel.

1075
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:58,464
We'll stay there tonight,
until we figure out what we're doing.

1076
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:01,217
We're not staying here another night.

1077
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,970
Here, let me get a shot of that thing
it made on your back.

1078
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:07,431
OK? Is that OK?

1079
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:17,942
Oh, Jesus!

1080
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,615
- Sorry. Looks like something bit you!
- I know.

1081
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:29,578
Let's go.

1082
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,581
Hey! Baby, you ready to go?

1083
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:36,669
Car's packed. Let's go. Hey, babe?

1084
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,340
Babe, hey!

1085
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:49,181
Babe. Let go of this thing.
Hey! Let go.

1086
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:52,977
Jesus Christ.

1087
01:18:57,357 --> 01:18:59,984
Babe? Oh my God!

1088
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:04,613
Hey. Katie! Katie! Wake up.

1089
01:19:04,781 --> 01:19:09,452
Jesus. I've had it with this shit!

1090
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:16,542
Babe! Come on, let's go.

1091
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:21,881
Let's get you up. Come on.
Hey. Come on. Come on.

1092
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:23,674
Let's get to the couch.

1093
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:28,512
Come on. I've had it with this shit.

1094
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,223
I'm taking care of this right now!

1095
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,242
Fuck this shit, I'm done!

1096
01:19:56,583 --> 01:20:00,836
Katie. Ready to go?
Let's get out of here.

1097
01:20:02,255 --> 01:20:03,255
Babe?

1098
01:20:03,423 --> 01:20:04,965
I packed the car. Let's go.

1099
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:07,259
I don't want to go.

1100
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:09,845
What're you talking about,
you don't want to go?

1101
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:11,764
Let's get the fuck
outta this house, now!

1102
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:15,559
I don't want to leave.
Will you stay with me?

1103
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:21,232
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I think it'd be better if we stay.

1104
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:24,151
Please. Just...

1105
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,905
I don't want to go.
I don't want to leave. Just trust me.

1106
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:30,241
You wanna stay here
and sleep in this fucking bed

1107
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:32,535
and be dragged down the hall?
I don't think so.

1108
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:35,079
We'll be OK. We'll be OK.
It's better if we stay.

1109
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:37,581
You fucking...

1110
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:44,255
I don't know what the hell's going on,
but this is insane. Fuck!

1111
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:52,012
I think we'll be OK now.

1112
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:04,353
- Micah!
- Katie!

1113
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,400
What's the matter,
honey?

1114
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:12,820
Oh, my God!

1115
01:23:13,305 --> 01:24:13,341
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
