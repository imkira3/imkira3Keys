1
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:32,750
<i>I got a star on my car and one on my chest</i>

2
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,336
<i>A gun on my hip and the right to arrest</i>

3
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:39,090
<i>I'm a guy who's the boss on this highway</i>

4
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,051
<i>So watch out what you're doin'
when you're drivin' my way</i>

5
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,179
<i>If you break the law,
you'll hear from me, I know</i>

6
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:49,892
<i>I'm workin' for the state,
I'm the highway patrol</i>

7
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:55,148
<i>Well, you'll know me when you see me
cos my door's painted white</i>

8
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:58,234
<i>My siren a-screamin'
and my flashin' red light</i>

9
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:01,237
<i>I work all day and I work all night</i>

10
00:01:01,446 --> 00:01:04,282
<i>Just to keep the law and order,
tryin' to do what's right</i>

11
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,535
<i>If I write you out a ticket,
then you'd better drive slow</i>

12
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:11,914
<i>I'm just a-doin' my job,
I'm the highway patrol</i>

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,337
<i>I'm the highway patrol,
the highway patrol</i>

14
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:20,256
<i>My hours are long and my pay is low</i>

15
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:23,468
<i>But I'll do my best to keep you drivin' slow</i>

16
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:27,847
<i>I'm just a-doin' my job,
I'm the highway patrol</i>

17
00:01:58,336 --> 00:02:02,548
<i>Meet Charlie.
Helpful dad, upstanding citizen,</i>

18
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:08,263
<i>and an 18-year veteran of the greatest
law enforcement agency in the land:</i>

19
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:11,474
<i>the Rhode Island State Police.</i>

20
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:20,358
<i>That's Charlie's home. Modest, like the man.</i>

21
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:25,655
<i>Even though he lived on the water,
Charlie wasn't much of a swimmer,</i>

22
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:29,200
<i>which will come into play
a little later in our story.</i>

23
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:32,370
<i>But I'm getting way ahead of myself.</i>

24
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:36,958
<i>You know, maybe it's best
if we just go back and begin at the beginning.</i>

25
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:42,005
<i>As a young man,
Charlie had the world by its bootstraps.</i>

26
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:44,590
<i>He was the best young trooper on the force,</i>

27
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,386
and was dating
<i>the prettiest and smartest gal in town.</i>

28
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:51,598
<i>Her name was Layla... just like the melody.</i>

29
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:53,683
Charlie,

30
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:56,644
you've no idea how much I love you.

31
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:02,275
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,529
Well, will you stay with me no matter what?

33
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:08,573
Of course, Charlie.

34
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:13,536
What if I had to move to the Arctic
and you could never come home

35
00:03:13,745 --> 00:03:18,124
and had to eat whale blubber for the rest
of your life? Would you still stay with me?

36
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,001
Yeah, I'd stay.

37
00:03:23,546 --> 00:03:25,506
But I hope that never happens.

38
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,634
Yeah, me too.

39
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:35,975
<i>Well, by springtime they had made it official.</i>

40
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:39,062
<i>Boy, let me tell you, that was some wedding.</i>

41
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:41,981
<i>It was presided over
by Father Ken Gumbert,</i>

42
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:46,277
<i>and half of the Rhode Island
State Police Force was in attendance.</i>

43
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:52,241
- Congratulations, Charlie.
- Thank you, captain.

44
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:12,637
All right!

45
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,517
Look what I got!

46
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,145
Here you go.

47
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:32,991
Excuse me, do you people take checks?

48
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,412
Say that again. Do "we people" take checks?
You mean a black man?

49
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,789
No, no, no, no! God, no. Your company.

50
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:43,167
Don't give me that bullshit!
That was a racist slur.

51
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:47,463
- No, it wasn't. I would never...
- Tell you what, I'll make it easy for you.

52
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,217
Why don't you just pay me in cotton
or a cartload of watermelons?

53
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:56,931
Or how's about some fried chicken cos you
know how black people love fried chicken!

54
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,434
- Hey, no, come on now.
- What's going on?

55
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:03,938
This cat don't believe a nigger knows how
to cash a check! Ain't that 'bout a bitch?

56
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:07,358
Charlie, I don't wanna ever hear you
use the n-word in this house.

57
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:11,613
What! I never said anything remotely racist!

58
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:15,450
- Oh, so it's a "little people" thing, then.
- No!

59
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:20,288
You think just cos I'm small you can
push me around? Well, come on, let's boogie.

60
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:23,833
I'm gonna give you a little lesson
in low centre of gravity.

61
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,796
Stop it! Cut it... Stop it now. Sir!

62
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:32,258
Don't patronise me with that "Sir" crap!

63
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:34,677
Hey, those are illegal. Stop.

64
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:42,143
Oh, it's on now. It's on!

65
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,649
- Charlie, don't hit him!
- Me?

66
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:51,152
Charlie! Stop it! Charlie, stop it!

67
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:53,821
Let me handle this. Stop it!

68
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:59,535
Excuse me, Mr Jackson...

69
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:03,706
Stop it! Wait. What is your first name?

70
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:05,875
It's Shonté.

71
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:11,506
Shonté, I am so, so sorry. I apologise.

72
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:14,550
Come on here. Let me walk you to your car.

73
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,471
I have no patience for people
who judge books by their cover.

74
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,473
And you shouldn't have to!

75
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:24,394
Treating me like a dumbshit!
I mean, who does he think he's talking to?

76
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:27,355
I'm a professor
of molecular genetics at Brown.

77
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:30,441
And I'm head of the Boston chapter of Mensa.

78
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:32,610
- You're kidding?
- No.

79
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,739
I'm just driving this limo
as a sociological experiment. That's it.

80
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:41,160
But Mensa?
I'm president of the Providence chapter.

81
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:43,204
No kidding.

82
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:52,672
<i>Just when Charlie thought
life couldn't get any sweeter,</i>

83
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,759
<i>old Mr Stork dropped in
to pay him and Layla a visit.</i>

84
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,638
It's a boy!

85
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:04,517
Oh boy, oy, oy.

86
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:09,355
Wow!

87
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:12,442
He's so...

88
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,112
Wow!

89
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,659
Whoa, you're in luck!

90
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:23,828
He's got company!

91
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:27,415
Push! Push!

92
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:32,837
<i>Charlie loved those boys so much,
he just couldn't face the truth.</i>

93
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:36,758
<i>And so he went on with his life
as if everything was normal.</i>

94
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:41,638
Hey, Finneran.

95
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:43,431
Hey, buddy.

96
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:47,185
- Hope you brought your appetite with you.
- Oh, I did.

97
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:51,481
- Charlie, your kids look great.
- Yeah, don't they? Thanks.

98
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:56,653
Charlie,

99
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,658
just between you and me, d'you ever notice
that your kids have a year-round tan?

100
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:04,827
Yeah, well...

101
00:08:05,662 --> 00:08:08,665
- My great-grandmother's half-Italian.
- Half-ltalian?

102
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:14,379
Well, that's probably why
the water beads off the hair, huh?

103
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:21,678
Yeah, so? I mean, a lot of people
have different kind of hair.

104
00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:24,430
What are you getting at?

105
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,849
Well, no, I'm just saying it's...

106
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:32,438
come on, goddamn it! Those kids' dicks
are bigger than them sausages!

107
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:35,233
Knock it off!
You're talking about my children.

108
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:38,444
- Since you brought it up, I wanna ask...
- Finneran!

109
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:41,030
Get over here. It's your turn.

110
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:47,912
Charlie...

111
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:51,958
Don't mind me.
It's just the beer talking, you know?

112
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,420
Sure.

113
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:06,014
There's something powerful
bubbling up inside me, Father.

114
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:10,268
And I'm afraid that some day,

115
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,773
if I don't do something, I'm gonna explode.

116
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:21,696
Where does this rage come from, my son?

117
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:24,824
I don't know. It's a lot of things, really.

118
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:27,910
Take my wife, for example.

119
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:30,496
I love her like no other, but...

120
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:34,250
part of me suspects
that she may be having an affair.

121
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,838
And I'm probably
just being paranoid here, but...

122
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:44,844
I get the feeling that the entire town
is laughing at me behind my back.

123
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,389
Charlie, that you?

124
00:09:50,183 --> 00:09:53,853
<i>Eventually,
Charlie's worst fears were realised.</i>

125
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,939
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

126
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:59,525
Really, I am.

127
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:01,778
But I have to do this.

128
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:04,030
I found my soul mate.

129
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:06,824
But...

130
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:09,452
I thought I was your soul mate.

131
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:14,457
Come on, legs! Let's roll, baby.

132
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:18,878
I don't know what to say.

133
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:22,340
I guess the heart just wants
what the heart wants.

134
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:26,970
Bye, Charlie.

135
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:31,808
But you said you'd eat whale blubber.

136
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:36,229
She'll be eating blubber all right,
just as soon as I free Willy.

137
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:55,415
<i>It's funny how a man reacts
when his heart gets broken.</i>

138
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:58,293
<i>Some break down and cry like a baby.</i>

139
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:01,587
<i>Others, they take out an Uzi
and climb a clock tower.</i>

140
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:05,049
<i>But Charlie Baileygates
didn't seem to react at all.</i>

141
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:10,972
<i>He just swallowed hard, felt that slab of
heartache slide over the lump in his throat</i>

142
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,516
<i>and he locked it all away.</i>

143
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:23,818
<i>As you can imagine, it wasn't easy for
little Jamaal, Lee Harvey and Shonté Junior</i>

144
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:25,987
<i>growing up without a mom.</i>

145
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:29,657
<i>But Charlie made that little house
into a big old home,</i>

146
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:31,659
<i>and the boys flourished.</i>

147
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:34,954
<i>Let me tell you, they were smart ones.</i>

148
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:38,666
- What are you building, fellas?
- An airplane, Daddy.

149
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,839
Bye-bye!

150
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:48,217
Bye, Daddy! Have a good time at work.

151
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:53,681
Love you, Daddy!

152
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:02,774
No! Hey, stop it!

153
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:04,984
Get... Jamaal, you're in a lot of trouble!

154
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,779
Get off that! Don't you take off in that!

155
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:12,784
<i>How many seas must a white...</i>

156
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:17,080
Shonté Junior, how can you keep
eating that crap and never gain weight?

157
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:19,415
I don't know. Just lucky, I guess.

158
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:26,297
- <i>How many times must the cannonball fly</i>
- Do you believe his voice?

159
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:31,344
- That's Gomer Pyle!
- <i>Before they're forever banned?</i>

160
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:34,264
Daddy, can we watch Richard Pryor on HBO?

161
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:37,558
Richard Pryor?

162
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:39,602
Please.

163
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:41,521
Okay.

164
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:46,067
<i>In Africa, though,
I go out in the country.</i>

165
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:50,613
<i>You see some lions and shit.
I'm talkin' about real lions.</i>

166
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:53,741
<i>Not them kind you be fuckin' with in the zoo.</i>

167
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:57,578
<i>You know how you go fuck with a lion?
"Hey, lion! Motherfucker!"</i>

168
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:02,542
<i>Be throwin' shit at it. Lion'd be "Oh, ooh".</i>

169
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,213
<i>As they have a way of doing,
the years passed somewhat regularly.</i>

170
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:10,800
<i>And the boys, well, they came into their own.</i>

171
00:13:12,552 --> 00:13:15,013
...<i>is make her toss my salad!</i>

172
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:19,100
<i>The guy's like "Toss my salad? What's that? "</i>

173
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:25,565
<i>Having your salad tossed means having
your asshole eaten out with jelly or syrup.</i>

174
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:27,317
<i>I prefer syrup.</i>

175
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,778
He's a funny motherfucker!

176
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:40,705
<i>Although Charlie's police work had
started to suffer, the kids were doing great.</i>

177
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:46,002
Damn! I can't figure out the atomic mass
of this motherfuckin' deuteron.

178
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,839
Shit. Man, that shit's simple. Lookit.

179
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:52,091
- Tell me this, tell me this.
- What?

180
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,510
What's a deuteron made up of?

181
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,512
Duh! A proton and a neutron.

182
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,808
Then what's this motherfuckin' electron
doin' right there?

183
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:04,520
- Shit, I don't know.
- Well, get it out of there then!

184
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:09,025
OK, so you're sayin' I add up the atomic
masses of the proton and the neutron, right?

185
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:12,862
I sees that, but what do I do with
the goddamn electron? Can I put it here?

186
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:16,741
Enrico Fermi'd roll over in his
motherfuckin' grave if he heard that.

187
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,243
He'd just turn over ass up in yo' face.

188
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:23,831
- Man, Jamaal. Just cut my man some slack.
- I'm just trying to help him save face.

189
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,793
He keep askin' questions,
they'll think he's stupid.

190
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,295
- I ain't stupid.
- Mornin', fellas.

191
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:31,547
Hey, Pops, how you doin', man?

192
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:35,176
- What's all the commotion?
- Oh, just school shit and shit.

193
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:37,595
- How's my little guy doing?
- Struggling.

194
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:41,849
Quantum physics is confusing. If I don't
buckle down, I'll get myself another B+.

195
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:43,935
Oh, that'd be whack.

196
00:14:44,143 --> 00:14:47,313
He's so fucking dumb,
he thinks calculus is a goddamn emperor.

197
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,856
Give it up, dawg.

198
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:52,277
Well, you think polypeptide's
a motherfuckin' toothpaste.

199
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:55,947
Oh, I gotta get out of here.
I don't wanna have to bust a cap.

200
00:14:57,365 --> 00:14:59,242
Kisses.

201
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:02,036
Mwah, Daddy.

202
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:04,372
- See ya later.
- Love ya.

203
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:09,294
<i>Yeah, Charlie was getting
a lot of respect inside the house.</i>

204
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:14,215
<i>But outside... Well, that was another story.</i>

205
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:21,264
Mornin', Ed.

206
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:23,182
Charlie.

207
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:26,102
Ed, did you see where my paper went today?

208
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:28,313
The wife's got it in the shitter.

209
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,153
Well, could you tell her to throw it
on the porch when she's done?

210
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,156
Can't you get one at work?

211
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:43,286
Yeah...

212
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,247
I suppose I could.

213
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:48,333
You betcha.

214
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,303
<i>I'd like that</i>

215
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,141
<i>If we could cycle down some lane</i>

216
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:08,561
<i>I'd like that</i>

217
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,982
<i>If we could ride into the rain</i>

218
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:14,943
<i>No macs, getting wet</i>

219
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:17,737
<i>I'd be your Albert</i>

220
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:21,157
<i>If you'd be Victoria</i>

221
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:26,913
<i>Ha-ha, we'd laugh
because each drop would make me</i>

222
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:30,625
<i>Grow up really high, really high</i>

223
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:34,712
<i>Like a really high thing, say a sunflower...</i>

224
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:37,840
- Hey, George, Herb.
- Hi, Charlie.

225
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:40,051
- How do, fellas?
- Hi, Charlie.

226
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:44,222
- Listen, Dick...
- Hey, guys, check out the rack on this one!

227
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:52,063
- Oh, yeah! That's what Daddy likes.
- It looks like a dead heat in a zeppelin race.

228
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:55,692
- A couple of Hindenburgs, huh?
- Oh, the humanity!

229
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,820
Come on, guys, take it easy. She's a mom.

230
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,247
"She's a mom!"

231
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:14,168
- She's a mom. Not my mom.
- She's a yummy mummy!

232
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,257
You kill me!

233
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,390
Sure, that is good.

234
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,273
Listen, Dick,
I'm sorry to bother you like this but...

235
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:39,402
your car is gonna have to be moved.

236
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:44,907
Yeah, sure, Charlie. OK. I should be
done here in another 10 or 15 minutes.

237
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:49,537
I hate to be a stickler, Dick, but...

238
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:54,083
the law says you can't park in one place
for over an hour, and you've been there for...

239
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:57,670
going on three days now.

240
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,591
All right, all right. The law's the law.

241
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:06,179
Park it up behind the grocery store,
will ya, Charlie?

242
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:12,393
Yeah, sure.

243
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:16,606
This one?

244
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:21,694
<i>There's an old saying: an ostrich
with his head in the sand makes a lousy cop.</i>

245
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:26,532
<i>You see, if you can't deal with your own
problems, well, it's hard to deal with others.</i>

246
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:30,495
Sweetie? That's kinda dangerous.

247
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:33,456
Wanna move it on to the sidewalk,
away from traffic?

248
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:37,001
My dad says you're a joke
and I don't have to listen to you.

249
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,009
Well, your father is entitled to his opinion.

250
00:18:45,218 --> 00:18:48,471
But I am an officer of the law,
and, by all rights, I could...

251
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,556
Fuck off!

252
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,809
You should watch your mouth, little girl.

253
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:06,406
Excuse me. Charlie!

254
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:09,617
Hey! You mind if I get ahead of you?
I'm in a wicked rush.

255
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:12,537
- Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
- You're a doll.

256
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:15,373
Hey, kids! Over here! Now!

257
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,878
Didn't I tell you to stay with me?

258
00:19:33,224 --> 00:19:35,476
<i>We're gonna rock you</i>

259
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:06,215
Vagiclean, huh?

260
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:09,844
What's the matter, honey?
Little extra cheese on the taco?

261
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,890
- Excuse me?
- No, excuse me.

262
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:18,978
There's no tag on this.

263
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:21,606
Price check on Vagiclean, aisle five.

264
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:24,359
<i>I repeat: price check on Vagiclean,</i>

265
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,945
aisle five. That's Vagiclean.

266
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,700
We got a customer with a fallopian fungus.
She's baking bread and I think it's sourdough.

267
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:39,082
Put a rush on that.

268
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:43,002
Hey, big guy. Did you hear the news?

269
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:46,381
My son Billy
got the lead in the high-school musical.

270
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:49,050
Well, I guess he likes the cock after all.

271
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:04,399
- Still wanna skip rope in the street?
- I'll tell my daddy, Charlie!

272
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:07,193
Wrong answer.
And the name's Hank, fuckface.

273

<i>Reciting memorised lines</i>

There you go, Dick. I parked it for you.

283
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:01,205
By the way,

284
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:06,669
you got a headlight out.

285
00:22:49,462 --> 00:22:51,089
That looks good.

286
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:54,634
- There you go, colonel.
- Very good, Malcolm. Thank you.

287
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:57,053

- 1-12 responding.

Doctors have diagnosed you
as having a "split personality".

A schizo.

295
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:30,044
- I don't remember this.
- That's because, according to that report,

296
00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:33,589
it wasn't you that this was happening to.
It was this other guy.

Hank.

298

- Said his name was Hank.
- And apparently Hank is trying to get out.

299

Trying to get out? What do you mean
"get out"? How did he get in?

300

- You created him.

Well, you know.
You've been avoiding confrontation.

00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:58,239
- But this guy inside.
- Hank.

304
00:23:58,448 --> 00:24:04,037
He doesn't. Doctors feel that you've created
this character out of necessity.

305
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:06,664
You never stick up for yourself.

306
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:10,460
Charlie, why didn't you take a vacation
when Layla left?

307
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:17,634
Why would I?

308
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,430
You know, wives leave their husbands
every day in this country.

309
00:24:22,597 --> 00:24:25,099
That's no reason
to short-change the department.

310
00:24:25,308 --> 00:24:27,477
I mean, it's not like I had the flu...

311
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:39,072
Have you picked up your medication?

312
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:49,457
I'm really not crazy about it, though.
It makes me so dry.

313
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:53,878
You have to take it anyway. Dr Rabinowitz
assures us, if you do, everything'll be fine.

314
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:56,714
This is a bunch of crap!

315
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,426
No wonder you're the smallest state.
Little mind, little state.

316
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:03,638
Shouldn't even be a state.
Should be a district.

317
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:06,516
Can you take these goddamn things off?

318
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:08,726
And could you stop lookin' at my ass!

319
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:12,814
Pritchard, what's going on here?

320
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:18,653
Well, colonel, her name's Waters, Irene P.
I pulled her over on 95 for a broken tail light.

321
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,073
I ran a check. She's got
an outstanding warrant in New York.

322
00:25:22,615 --> 00:25:24,492
- Hit and run?
- Hit and run.

323
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,869
Injured pedestrian signed the complaint.

324
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:30,498
Well, I think I might remember that.
That is ridiculous.

325
00:25:30,707 --> 00:25:33,293
I've never been in an accident.
Not in my whole life.

326
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:37,171
Well, I've just gotten off the phone
with the New York State Patrol.

327
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,300
They don't seem to think it's so ridiculous.

328
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:46,139
- Look... How can we fix...
- Where you in Massela last friday?

329
00:25:46,472 --> 00:25:50,101
Well, yeah, I live there.
But I didn't have any accident.

330
00:25:51,102 --> 00:25:54,272
I'm just driving down
to Block Island to see my sister.

331
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:59,569
You seem like a nice guy. Is there any way
that you might let me handle this by mail or...

332
00:25:59,777 --> 00:26:03,156
Unfortunately, Miss Waters,
I'm not the one you have to convince.

333
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:06,784
If there's been a mistake,
you have to clear it up in Massena.

334
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:10,913
What? Because of somebody else's mistake,

335
00:26:11,122 --> 00:26:15,251
I have to get in my car and
drive all the way back to upstate New York?

336
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,387
No, ma'am.

337
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:30,642
We'll have one of our troopers escort you.

338
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:38,232
Hey, Hollywood, turn your fuckin' phone off.

339
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:40,318
- Yeah?
- <i>You're an asshole.</i>

340
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:42,403
Oh, hello, Irene. What'd I do now?

341
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,239
Listen, I'm at a police station in Rhode Island.

342
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:48,326
They're shipping me back to Massena
on some bogus crap.

343
00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:51,955
- <i>Sound familiar?</i>
- I don't have a clue what you're talkin' about.

344
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:54,666
Dickie, cut the bullshit!

345
00:26:58,753 --> 00:27:00,713
Listen to me, OK?

346
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,091
It's over, Dickie. It's over.

347
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:09,055
So please just stop messing with me and call
your friends and tell them to back off, OK?

348
00:27:09,222 --> 00:27:11,099
<i>Look, I'm being a straight shooter.</i>

349
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:16,521
If you need help, I'll help you. Just give me
all the details and I'll get to the bottom of it.

350
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:21,985
Massena, New York!
Goddamn, Daddy! That's near Canada!

351
00:27:22,193 --> 00:27:24,696
I know, I know. Wasn't my idea.

352
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:29,534
I gotta take this gal up north, and then the
colonel ordered me to take a week's vacation.

353
00:27:29,742 --> 00:27:31,828
A week's a long motherfuckin' time.

354
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:35,373
He wants me to rest
while I'm getting used to the medication.

355
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,752
Oh, come on. You don't have to worry
about us, Daddy. We're grown up now.

356
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:42,422
These two can do the shopping.
I'll do the cooking.

357
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,676
You do the cooking? Man, you thought
you got chipped beef from a toothy blow job!

358
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:51,639
You're gonna have Shonté Junior
down or under goddamn 400lb. Fuck that.

359
00:27:51,848 --> 00:27:54,684
Can't have that happen. OK, guys.

360
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:59,897
I'm not leaving till the morning, but
you know the rules: no bitches after eleven.

361
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,651
- All right, Pops.
- Yeah, man.

362
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:06,321
- Got you, Papa.
- Love you, Daddy!

363
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,160
So who the hell's this Irene honey anyway?

364
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,912
She worked for me the past two years.

365
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:18,958
I hired her to be my golf-course
superintendent. We got close.

366
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:21,044
No, you got stupid!

367
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:27,717
For the love of shit, these are the loose ends
that can hang you, Dickie! And me too!

368
00:28:28,176 --> 00:28:32,305
- How much does she know?
- She might have gotten wind of some things.

369
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,974
Yeah, well, we're gonna find out.

370
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:37,769
The complaint was signed
by a guy named Peterson.

371
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:43,024
- He's with the EPA.
- EPA? I thought they were in our pocket.

372
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:45,735
Well, not all of 'em.

373
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:50,156
<i>Even though Charlie didn't
wholeheartedly agree with the top brass,</i>

374
00:28:50,365 --> 00:28:52,492
<i>he did as he was told.</i>

375
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,453
- Careful on the road, Charlie.
- OK, colonel.

376
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,543
- Hang on, ma'am.
- Yeah.

377
00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:14,389
This vacation is just what Charlie needs.

378
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:16,975
I bet he's a new man when he gets back.

379
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:20,144
If we let him back.

380
00:29:21,896 --> 00:29:23,856
What do you mean?

381
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:27,235
Well, I mean that
he's become a pretty big liability.

382
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:30,697
We may have to let him go.

383
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:34,492
Let him go? But, captain,
police work is Charlie's whole li...

384
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:36,577
I know, I know, damn it.

385
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,080
I know.

386
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:44,460
<i>I found you sittin' on a suitcase cryin'...</i>

387
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:49,757
It's a great time of year to ride,
as long as you don't mind one or two bugs.

388
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,063
<i>The train came in breathless</i>

389
00:30:04,272 --> 00:30:05,648
<i>The passengers restless</i>

390
00:30:05,857 --> 00:30:09,193
<i>She said "Baby, you'll never change"</i>

391
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,656
<i>You gotta get goin', you gotta keep goin'</i>

392
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:17,160
<i>Hey, the world ain't slowin' down</i>

393
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:18,953
<i>For no one</i>

394
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:23,791
<i>It's a carnival callin' out to you</i>

395
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:29,088
<i>It sounds like a song,
it hits you like scripture...</i>

396
00:30:29,297 --> 00:30:31,799
Boy, you can't beat the open road!

397
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:39,557
<i>Weren't you the kid
who just climbed on the merry-go-round?</i>

398
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:44,312
<i>Hey, look, the world ain't slowin' down</i>

399
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:48,900
Oh, no.

400
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:50,985
Oh, my goodness.

401
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:53,071
Jeez.

402
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:56,449
Those damn truckers.

403
00:30:56,658 --> 00:31:00,328
You know, you think
they'd call someone to come clean this up.

404
00:31:01,245 --> 00:31:05,375
Poor thing. That's terrible.

405
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,296
By the looks of her,
she's been here for a while.

406
00:31:10,463 --> 00:31:14,133
Well, I doubt we're gonna be able
to move her, but we should try.

407
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:16,219
You wanna get that end? Give it a push?

408
00:31:16,386 --> 00:31:19,222
- Really?
- Yeah, we should give it a shot.

409
00:31:20,014 --> 00:31:21,224
- OK?
- OK.

410
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:24,185
Go ahead. Just push as hard as you can.

411
00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:26,229
Yeah, OK.

412
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:28,815
Jesus! Holy...

413
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:32,151
- OK...
- It's still alive!

414
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,656
- Just stand back. I'll take care of it.
- Oh, God! That's terrible.

415
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:40,034
Now, don't look, OK?

416
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:48,251
Well, old girl.

417
00:31:49,294 --> 00:31:51,170
Your suffering's over.

418
00:31:58,928 --> 00:32:02,974
<i>Oh, it ain't always easy
doing Mother Nature's work.</i>

419
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:18,448
- Do you believe that?
- No, it's...

420
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:21,701
My God in heaven!

421
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:28,082
What is wrong with you?

422
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,667
Die!

423
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:33,296
Let go! Let go, girl!

424
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:38,343
On to greener pastures, come on.
They're clear-cutting a place in heaven for ya.

425
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:40,720
Come on! Help me out!

426
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:42,722
- But...
- Do something!

427
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:45,475
- I don't...
- Let go!

428
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:50,104
Let go! Go!

429
00:33:00,573 --> 00:33:02,367
Well,

430
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:04,535
that was tough, but...

431
00:33:05,495 --> 00:33:07,497
I think we did the right thing.

432
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:22,845
Patrol car, yes. OK, thank you.

433
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:27,892
- Can I help you?
- Baileygates, Rhode Island State Police.

434
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:30,937
I have your prisoner, Miss Irene Waters, here.

435
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,858
- All right. I'll tell them you're here.
- Okay-dee, ray-dee.

436
00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:49,539
What are those for?

437
00:33:49,747 --> 00:33:52,917
Oh, it's just this stupid thing.

438
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:58,214
I have to take a pill every six hours
or I feel funny. No big deal.

439
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:01,259
What's it called?

440
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:06,556
Advance delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage.

441
00:34:11,978 --> 00:34:14,272
Does your ass feel numb?

442
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:17,483
No, but...

443
00:34:18,484 --> 00:34:20,862
they give me unbelievable cotton mouth.

444
00:34:21,195 --> 00:34:24,449
- I meant from the ride.
- Oh. No, no.

445
00:34:24,616 --> 00:34:27,118
Over the years my ass has taken a pounding.

446
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:33,207
Miss Waters, my name's Peterson.
This is my partner, Agent Boshane.

447
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:37,211
We're with the Environmental
Protection Agency's Special Investigations.

448
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,796
The EPA?

449
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:41,090
What'd I hit? A baldheaded eagle?

450
00:34:41,591 --> 00:34:46,220
We'll explain that to you, ma'am, but right
now we're gonna ask you to come with us.

451
00:34:48,932 --> 00:34:51,935
Well, why don't you just
explain it to me now?

452
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:57,899
We put your hit-and-run report
out on the wire in order to track you down.

453
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,486
Track me down for what?

454
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:03,571
Agent Boshane?

455
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:09,494
I want to remind you again,
our station's at your disposal.

456
00:35:09,702 --> 00:35:12,121
You're welcome to use
our interrogation rooms.

457
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,583
We appreciate it, Lieutenant Gerke,
but we're all set.

458
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,796
Right. Well, if there's anything at all I...

459
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:34,936
Excuse me.

460
00:35:35,144 --> 00:35:37,355
I'm just gonna...

461
00:35:37,563 --> 00:35:39,941
get myself a drink of water.

462
00:35:48,283 --> 00:35:53,371
So, if I could just get someone
to sign this, I'll be on my way.

463
00:35:53,705 --> 00:35:55,581
Yeah.

464
00:35:57,166 --> 00:36:00,962
Well, Miss Waters, good luck.
I hope everything works out great for you.

465
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:03,881
Thanks a lot, Charlie.

466
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:07,802
I haven't done anything wrong
and you know it.

467
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:13,766
What about the marijuana roaches you left
when you moved out of your apartment?

468
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:17,395
So I smoked some pot. What is that, a crime?

469
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:25,194
As is being an accessory to bribery,
embezzlement, tax evasion and racketeering.

470
00:36:25,403 --> 00:36:29,949
- What are you talking about?
- Does the name Dickie Thurman ring a bell?

471
00:36:31,242 --> 00:36:35,955
His company, Cedar Creek Limited,
has been under investigation for 18 months.

472
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:40,209
How does that make me an accessory?
I laid sod on Dickie's golf course. So what?

473
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:44,964
Tell me this. A big operation
like the Cedar Creek country club.

474
00:36:45,131 --> 00:36:49,177
- How'd you become the head greenskeeper?
- By default.

475
00:36:49,344 --> 00:36:54,265
This guy, Tedeschi or Tedesco,
he was hired before me, but he died.

476
00:36:54,724 --> 00:36:57,060
Heart problem or something.

477
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:02,148
<i>The feds believed that Irene
knew more than she thought she knew,</i>

478
00:37:02,357 --> 00:37:04,525
<i>and her life was in danger.</i>

479
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:08,363
<i>They explained that everything
had been happening under her nose.</i>

480
00:37:08,571 --> 00:37:12,367
<i>Payoffs of government agencies,
threats to those who stood in the way.</i>

481
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:18,581
<i>And her predecessor's heart attack?
Well, that was just cold-blooded murder.</i>

482
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,917
Oh, man!

483
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:31,928
Can you excuse me?

484
00:37:50,446 --> 00:37:52,573
Pizza kid.

485
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:58,288
- How much?
- That comes to $13.95.

486
00:38:23,563 --> 00:38:25,440
Son of a bitch!

487
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,667
<i>It was a good thing Charlie had told her</i>

488
00:38:44,876 --> 00:38:49,339
<i>he was staying at the</i> Chuck E Cheese Lodge
and Miniature Golf Resort.

489
00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:51,382
Charlie?

490
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:55,720
<i>Irene finagled the key from the front desk
and let herself in.</i>

491
00:38:55,929 --> 00:38:57,805
Charlie!

492
00:39:07,899 --> 00:39:10,652
Charlie, what's going on here?

493
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:12,195
Irene?

494
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:19,410
Irene, I was just...
I was gonna study your file

495
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:22,205
and try to find a loophole.

496
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:27,752
Did your lips get as chapped as mine
on the ride down?

497
00:39:27,919 --> 00:39:32,715
Never mind. I need your help. There was
a shootout at the thing. The agents are dead!

498
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,469
- Dead?
- Yeah. They were after me, Charlie!

499
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:39,597
Oh, God. This is Dickie's work. I know it!

500
00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:45,728
So what are you gonna do?

501
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:49,524
- We'll call the police.
- What? No, you can't do that!

502
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:53,069
Dickie has those guys in his back pocket.
That's why I came to you.

503
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:57,615
Hey! This is serious shit!

504
00:39:57,824 --> 00:39:59,701
You don't...

505
00:40:00,285 --> 00:40:02,787
- I'm outta here.
- Hey, wait! No, don't do that!

506
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:05,748
Come on, hold on.
Just let me think for a second. OK?

507
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:09,460
Think someplace else.
This is the first place they're gonna look.

508
00:40:09,669 --> 00:40:11,546
Damn it!

509
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:21,222
So where are we going anyway?

510
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:23,308
You'll see.

511
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:30,315
<i>Well, they went on the lam for a bit, and
then Charlie made a couple of phone calls.</i>

512
00:40:40,283 --> 00:40:42,160
Take it easy now.

513
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:45,580
- Charlie!
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

514
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,751
- Good work, Baileygates.
- Thanks.

515
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:53,046
- Sorry I had to meet you all the way out here.
- That's OK.

516
00:40:53,254 --> 00:40:55,381
It's just as well. Poor gal's paranoid.

517
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:59,969
My kids are like that. They have this idea
that the cops are the bad guys...

518
00:41:06,893 --> 00:41:10,813
Listen, I don't know what's going on
and I didn't tell the feds anything...

519
00:41:11,022 --> 00:41:14,609
Dickie told me you were street-smart. Huh?

520
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:17,236
Why the hell would you run to this idiot?

521
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:25,036
Drop the gun, moron.

522
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:27,288
You're being video-taped.

523
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:32,293
- What're you talking about?
- There's a camera on my bike.

524
00:41:36,297 --> 00:41:38,716
Hard to hit a moving target, isn't it?

525
00:41:54,774 --> 00:41:57,026
Score. Good move.

526
00:41:57,568 --> 00:41:59,445
Get in the car.

527
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:02,991
Come on, come on, come on.

528
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:09,497
D'you mind telling me
what you were thinking?

529
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:12,333
Calling that cop was unbelievably stupid!

530
00:42:15,795 --> 00:42:18,548
Tweak the high end
on your emotional EQ, sweetbeak.

531
00:42:18,756 --> 00:42:21,134
The funky chicken was Charlie's dance.

532
00:42:21,342 --> 00:42:23,803
I'm a tango man myself.

533
00:42:29,726 --> 00:42:32,812
<i>As you can imagine,
there was some explaining to do.</i>

534
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:36,733
<i>So Hank, as he called himself,</i>

535
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:41,237
<i>found a quiet spot
and spelled out the whole darn mess.</i>

536
00:42:41,446 --> 00:42:44,616
OK, so what you're saying
is that you're not Charlie.

537
00:42:45,408 --> 00:42:49,162
You've seen Charlie in action.
He's like origami: folds under pressure.

538
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:52,624
When the big game's on the line,
he's busy riding the pine.

539
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:55,585
OK, wait. Can you just...?

540
00:43:00,548 --> 00:43:02,425
It's simple.

541
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:08,181
Charlie's the mouse that got you into
the maze. I'm the rat who can find the cheese.

542
00:43:08,723 --> 00:43:11,809
The name's Hank. Hank Evans...

543
00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:14,896
<i>For little girls</i>

544
00:43:15,063 --> 00:43:18,816
So it's true. Charlie is a schizo.

545
00:43:19,025 --> 00:43:23,154
I wouldn't know. I stay out of his business,
he stays out of mine.

546
00:43:23,696 --> 00:43:25,406
Look.

547
00:43:28,201 --> 00:43:31,537
Just because I rock
doesn't mean I'm made of stone.

548
00:43:31,704 --> 00:43:36,084
I feel your fear. It's coming through
like static on my heart radio.

549
00:43:38,586 --> 00:43:40,463
Hank? Hank.

550
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:44,968
I really, really appreciate your help,

551
00:43:45,176 --> 00:43:51,766
but is there any way that maybe we could
get Charlie back out here for a little huddle?

552
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:56,980
No problem. While you're at it, why not climb
that pole and take a piss on the power lines?

553
00:43:57,188 --> 00:43:59,941
Look, I'm not here to twist your niblets.

554
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:05,113
I'm here to save your life, but if I'm gonna
do that, I'll need total <i>uninononynymity.</i>

555
00:44:10,868 --> 00:44:12,078
OK.

556
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:15,081
Sound good, candy pants?

557
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,333
Hank, don't call me that.

558
00:44:29,846 --> 00:44:32,015
How the hell can they call Pluto a planet?

559
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:36,352
What motherfuckin' planet has an
elliptical orbit? This shit don't make sense.

560
00:44:37,061 --> 00:44:41,524
Motherfucker! That motherfucker Vince
Foster was murdered. I told you that shit!

561
00:44:42,108 --> 00:44:45,028
Hey, man, quit hackin' into
them goddamn Pentagon files.

562
00:44:45,236 --> 00:44:49,699
Ain't no nevermind who them crooked
politicians be killin'. You need to study.

563
00:44:50,116 --> 00:44:52,869
- What did Daddy tell you about snoopin'?
- Shit, yeah.

564
00:44:53,036 --> 00:44:56,372
If you keep fuckin' around,
you'll lose your Yale scholarship.

565
00:44:56,539 --> 00:45:01,002
Be stuck up there at Stanford with
them goddamn motherfuckers.

566
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:05,548
Motherfucker, you be lucky to get
accepted to Duke, gettin' a 1430 on yo' SAT.

567
00:45:05,757 --> 00:45:08,259
- Motherfucker, you know I had the flu.
- Flu, my ass!

568
00:45:08,468 --> 00:45:11,137
You had a motherfuckin' aneurysm
to get a 1430.

569
00:45:11,304 --> 00:45:13,890
Hey, you talkin' some shit now.

570
00:45:14,098 --> 00:45:17,435
That's probably one of them
Ivy League sons of bitches now.

571
00:45:17,602 --> 00:45:20,188
Show me yo' ass head up
and get the door, man.

572
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,360
Hey, captain.

573
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:27,779
- Fellas.
- What the fuck is goin' on, man?

574
00:45:28,696 --> 00:45:31,449
- This is Agent Annicelli.
- Gentlemen.

575
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:34,410
- What's happenin'?
- We've got a problem.

576
00:45:35,495 --> 00:45:36,955
Pack your bags.

577
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:44,671
- We're locked and loaded.
- Great.

578
00:45:44,879 --> 00:45:47,090
Got enough stuff to hold us over for 72 hours.

579
00:46:01,938 --> 00:46:03,815
Well, fuck my ozone.

580
00:46:20,832 --> 00:46:22,709
<i>We're gonna rock you</i>

581
00:46:31,217 --> 00:46:32,760
Hey, ringworm.

582
00:46:36,055 --> 00:46:38,975
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you,
you toxic waste of life.

583
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:42,437
You gonna pick up that butt?

584
00:46:42,604 --> 00:46:45,940
Or do I have to glue it to my shoe
and stick it in your pimply a-hole?

585
00:46:46,566 --> 00:46:50,194
Hey, man. Take it easy. It's just a cigarette.

586
00:46:50,653 --> 00:46:52,697
Oh, yeah?

587
00:46:52,905 --> 00:46:58,036
Well, this is just a fist, but when I throw it
around, it can leave one hell of a mess.

588
00:46:58,244 --> 00:46:59,954
Let's dance.

589
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:27,482
- Let's kick the shit out of this crazy asshole!
- Wait, he's a schizo!

590
00:47:28,441 --> 00:47:30,443
What the hell's wrong with him?

591
00:47:32,403 --> 00:47:34,989
What happened anyway?

592
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:39,535
<i>Yeah, Charlie was taking a few lumps
on account of Hank's behaviour.</i>

593
00:47:39,702 --> 00:47:44,582
<i>But, save for a little blood in the urine,
he was no worse for the wear.</i>

594
00:47:46,376 --> 00:47:49,212
I'm sorry you had to meet Hank, Miss Waters.

595
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,464
I thought I was bad.

596
00:47:51,673 --> 00:47:54,092
That guy has some serious problems.

597
00:47:55,468 --> 00:47:57,887
He did save our lives.

598
00:48:00,014 --> 00:48:03,893
- Anyway, Hank had a good idea. He thinks...
- You're gonna listen to Hank?

599
00:48:04,102 --> 00:48:08,731
Come on, look what he did to me!
What are you thinking? He's out of control.

600
00:48:10,608 --> 00:48:15,571
You know what we should do? Find another
department and tell them the whole story.

601
00:48:16,322 --> 00:48:20,285
Not smart, Charlie.
We don't know how far Dickie's reach goes.

602
00:48:22,328 --> 00:48:24,205
Then you know what?

603
00:48:24,414 --> 00:48:28,793
I think it's time to call the best damn
law enforcement agency in the country.

604
00:48:29,002 --> 00:48:31,004
The Rhode Island State Troopers!

605
00:48:31,212 --> 00:48:35,842
Do you really think that the feds don't have
some guy up there right now bugging calls?

606
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:41,097
They'd be on us in ten minutes. And
they almost got me killed in the first place.

607
00:48:41,848 --> 00:48:43,308
OK.

608
00:48:43,474 --> 00:48:45,768
What was the genius's big plan?

609
00:48:45,977 --> 00:48:49,230
He thinks that we should find a cabin
and hide out for a while.

610
00:48:49,397 --> 00:48:51,649
Oh, yeah? What about water and food and...

611
00:48:51,858 --> 00:48:54,694
He already got supplies. They're in the trunk.

612
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:07,332
These are the supplies?

613
00:49:10,668 --> 00:49:12,962
Well, he had a plan, all right.

614
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:16,799
That's it? That's all he got?

615
00:49:17,008 --> 00:49:18,885
Oh, no. There's more.

616
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:21,387
A rope,

617
00:49:21,554 --> 00:49:23,431
shovel,

618
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:27,143
bag of lime and some lawn darts.

619
00:49:30,146 --> 00:49:33,608
This is Christine Dicarlo
live from Clinton county, New York,

620
00:49:33,816 --> 00:49:37,528
where the manhunt continues for
Rhode Island State Trooper Baileygates.

621
00:49:37,737 --> 00:49:41,783
... responsible for the death of an EPA agent
and the kidnapping of Irene Waters.

622
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,329
Bullshit! My daddy ain't killed nobody
and he sure ain't kidnapped no bitch!

623
00:49:46,537 --> 00:49:49,624
Your dad's sick, mentally.
He's had a breakdown.

624
00:49:49,832 --> 00:49:53,002
The important thing is we find him
so nobody else gets hurt.

625
00:49:53,503 --> 00:49:57,548
- Nobody's gonna get hurt.
- Our daddy wouldn't hurt a motherfuckin' fly.

626
00:49:57,924 --> 00:50:03,012
No, he goes after bigger game. We just got
a report he put six bullets into a cow's head.

627
00:50:03,513 --> 00:50:05,682
Poor thing's lucky to be alive.

628
00:50:07,976 --> 00:50:12,939
OK, look, let's say he does have a problem -
which he don't. He's been takin' pills.

629
00:50:13,147 --> 00:50:16,985
- He left his pills in the hotel room.
- That's where he left his sanity.

630
00:50:17,193 --> 00:50:20,655
I've seen it first-hand.
The guy's nuttier than squirrel turds.

631
00:50:20,863 --> 00:50:24,409
One thing I don't understand, Lieutenant.

632
00:50:24,617 --> 00:50:28,288
If my daddy's such a scary-ass motherfucker,
why'd you go by yourself?

633
00:50:28,496 --> 00:50:31,874
Who the fuck are you? Sergeant York
taking on the Germans yourself?

634
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:35,295
Your father's a police officer.
He asked me to come alone.

635
00:50:35,503 --> 00:50:38,756
- How was I to know he's a nutcase?
- He ain't no fuckin' nutcase!

636
00:50:38,923 --> 00:50:42,969
He may have delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage,

637
00:50:43,136 --> 00:50:45,555
but he is a very gentle person.

638
00:50:45,972 --> 00:50:47,849
<i>Motherfucker robot! Motherfucker robot!</i>

639
00:50:55,898 --> 00:50:57,442
What's the fuss?

640
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:03,072
Stay away from me, Hank! I know what you
had planned. I saw your so-called supplies.

641
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:08,036
That.

642
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,956
I wasn't gonna just ram it home... though.

643
00:51:12,123 --> 00:51:14,208
I was gonna lube it up

644
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:17,670
and ease it in there inch by inch
like a gentleman.

645
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:21,424
I was talking about the shovel and the lime.

646
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:24,010
Shovel and lime?

647
00:51:32,268 --> 00:51:35,438
Thank you.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.

648
00:51:35,647 --> 00:51:37,106
What's so funny?

649
00:51:37,315 --> 00:51:40,068
- We're driving a hot carriage.
- So?

650
00:51:40,234 --> 00:51:42,320
That stuff belongs to the bad cop.

651
00:51:42,528 --> 00:51:46,324
You think he was gonna take
our dead bodies down to the station?

652
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:59,420
<i>Irene decided they should go back
to Rhode Island, but Hank had an idea first.</i>

653
00:51:59,587 --> 00:52:01,881
Are you sure about this?

654
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:06,010
You kidding? Every oinker east of the
Mississippi will be looking for this sled.

655
00:52:06,219 --> 00:52:07,929
Safer to go mass transit.

656
00:52:08,096 --> 00:52:10,056
Ready? On nine.

657
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:12,141
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

658
00:52:27,073 --> 00:52:30,451
Well, they won't be tracking us in that car.

659
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,870
- Thanks for the kudos.
- Sure.

660
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:35,832
- Glad we're finally on the same page.
- Me, too.

661
00:52:38,668 --> 00:52:41,838
- You OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

662
00:52:43,673 --> 00:52:46,050
Thought you were going over the edge.

663
00:52:46,259 --> 00:52:48,136
Thank you.

664
00:52:52,056 --> 00:52:54,642
You know, I think you're a very special unit.

665
00:52:54,851 --> 00:52:56,227
That's sweet.

666
00:52:56,728 --> 00:52:59,480
I hope we can get to know each other better.

667
00:52:59,647 --> 00:53:01,357
Yeah. Me too.

668
00:53:01,774 --> 00:53:03,568
Do you swallow?

669
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:09,824
I get it. We'll go slow.

670
00:53:16,581 --> 00:53:18,458
- Hey!
- Yes?

671
00:53:19,626 --> 00:53:23,421
You didn't happen
to pick up a wallet on the dash, did you?

672
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:25,715
You're kidding, right?

673
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,387
So what's your tale? Where you from?

674
00:53:31,596 --> 00:53:33,556
Oh, all over.

675
00:53:33,765 --> 00:53:36,851
Omnipresence. I like that in a woman.

676
00:53:37,018 --> 00:53:40,271
I'm originally from Texas.
Middle-class neighbourhood.

677
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,815
But after school I moved to New York cos...

678
00:53:43,024 --> 00:53:47,570
Let me guess. Everybody said you were easy
on the eyes, so you tried to become a model.

679
00:53:47,737 --> 00:53:52,450
But in the Big Apple, they treated you
like the worm, so you became an actress.

680
00:53:52,742 --> 00:53:54,535
No, but...

681
00:53:55,578 --> 00:53:57,580
But you can't get far without talent,

682
00:53:57,789 --> 00:54:01,918
and the only bright lights you saw
were the ones inside the fridge.

683
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:05,964
So you got a boob job and went
looking for a rich man with a bum ticker

684
00:54:06,172 --> 00:54:10,802
and waved a white flag
in the face of your own self-loathing.

685
00:54:12,762 --> 00:54:15,598
- How's my aim?
- I never went to New York city.

686
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:19,477
I went to Cornell, then I got my master's
in Turf Management at U-Mass.

687
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:22,105
Then I became a golf-course superintendent.

688
00:54:22,313 --> 00:54:28,319
- And these are all mine.
- I notice you left out your eating disorder.

689
00:54:28,486 --> 00:54:30,697
- I don't have an eating disorder.
- Whatever, slim.

690
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:39,330
Hands off, Hank.

691
00:54:49,007 --> 00:54:50,717
Mom!

692
00:54:50,883 --> 00:54:55,013
That's real nice, Hank.
Way to keep a low profile.

693
00:54:55,221 --> 00:54:57,098
It's survival at this point.

694
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:01,978
Hey, I know how to score some dough.

695
00:55:03,563 --> 00:55:05,440
- Punch me.
- What?

696
00:55:05,648 --> 00:55:07,609
- Punch me in the face.
- Why?

697
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,528
I'll tell the big cheese
I got rolled in the parking lot.

698
00:55:10,737 --> 00:55:14,532
He'll hush me with some Benjamin's.
They don't need that kind of ink.

699
00:55:14,741 --> 00:55:16,701
Come on, rip my head off.

700
00:55:16,909 --> 00:55:20,955
- That's really lame, Hank.
- You have a better idea? Come on!

701
00:55:21,664 --> 00:55:24,584
- It's not gonna work.
- Yes, it is, but you gotta rock me.

702
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:28,129
Don't give me a girly
"I don't want to break a fingernail" tap.

703
00:55:28,296 --> 00:55:31,215
This guy's gotta look at my face and just...

704
00:55:35,845 --> 00:55:39,474
<i>Well, the kick in the chops
didn't work out as planned.</i>

705
00:55:39,682 --> 00:55:42,685
<i>It just left Charlie a little more roughed up.</i>

706
00:55:42,852 --> 00:55:44,479
How's the nose feeling?

707
00:55:44,646 --> 00:55:46,522
Listen to it.

708
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:52,236
- I'm really sorry, Charlie.
- I'll get over it.

709
00:55:53,363 --> 00:55:57,033
I mean, you should be furious.
I just drop-kicked you right in the face.

710
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:59,202
Hey, it happens.

711
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:06,709
You got a great way of looking at life, Charlie.
You know that? That's a gift.

712
00:56:06,918 --> 00:56:11,130
Yeah, I don't know if my shrinks would agree.
They think that's my problem.

713
00:56:11,297 --> 00:56:12,674
What?

714
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:19,847
That I purposely distort my perceptions
to make my reality more palatable.

715
00:56:20,473 --> 00:56:23,476
Like you only hear what you wanna hear?

716
00:56:23,685 --> 00:56:27,188
Thanks. I like to keep it short,
especially in the summer.

717
00:56:30,817 --> 00:56:35,863
How come I couldn't have ended up with
an easy-going guy like you, Charlie? Huh?

718
00:56:36,072 --> 00:56:40,702
Sometimes I think there's something about
my look that just attracts assholes.

719
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:44,664
That's crazy.
You're a very special girl, Irene. Look at you.

720
00:56:44,872 --> 00:56:46,582
You're just so down-to-earth.

721
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:50,128
I mean, look at your hair.
It's like you don't give a damn.

722
00:56:50,336 --> 00:56:55,425
And you let your skin hang out, blemishes
an' all. You're not afraid of your flaws.

723
00:56:55,633 --> 00:56:59,053
Your face is all pursed up
like you just sucked on a lemon,

724
00:56:59,262 --> 00:57:00,972
but you pull it off!

725
00:57:10,273 --> 00:57:12,650
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

726
00:57:13,818 --> 00:57:16,029
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

727
00:57:20,366 --> 00:57:22,243
Come on!

728
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:26,164
- I don't know if I can!
- Yes, you can!

729
00:57:26,372 --> 00:57:28,750
Humans only use 10% of their potential!

730
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:32,295
You gotta reach down
for that little extra something!

731
00:57:35,965 --> 00:57:37,842
There you go!

732
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:40,178
Now you're gettin' it!

733
00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:41,930
I believe in you!

734
00:57:43,389 --> 00:57:45,850
Don't you give up on me now!

735
00:57:51,397 --> 00:57:54,317
Easier than I thought! Come on!

736
00:57:54,984 --> 00:57:57,820
Go, Charlie. Go! You can do it!

737
00:57:57,987 --> 00:57:59,697
Come on, Charlie!

738
00:57:59,989 --> 00:58:02,492
Use more of your potential!

739
00:58:09,707 --> 00:58:11,668
Come on, Charlie! Go!

740
00:58:12,043 --> 00:58:13,670
Jump off!

741
00:58:13,836 --> 00:58:15,838
- What?
- Jump off!

742
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:17,966
What?

743
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,135
Jump off the train!

744
00:58:29,852 --> 00:58:31,396
Irene?

745
00:58:32,814 --> 00:58:34,983
Come on. Stop fooling around.

746
00:58:36,317 --> 00:58:39,237
I started thinking about it. Bad idea.

747
00:58:39,445 --> 00:58:42,365
Trains are the first place they'll look.

748
00:58:43,032 --> 00:58:45,451
Oh, come on.

749
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,706
We checked all the gas and food stops
along the interstate. No sign of 'em.

750
00:58:49,872 --> 00:58:52,542
Interstate! Is your old lady happy?

751
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:55,586
My old lady?

752
00:58:55,753 --> 00:59:00,383
Cos if your fuckin' is like your police work,
you couldn't hit the G spot on a 12lb pussy.

753
00:59:01,175 --> 00:59:03,511
Watch yourself.

754
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,974
- What are you gettin' at?
- Look, Daddy ain't gonna take no road

755
00:59:08,182 --> 00:59:11,019
where y'all blind-ass cops is lookin'.

756
00:59:11,185 --> 00:59:14,022
And, motherfucker, he don't eat fast food.

757
00:59:16,691 --> 00:59:19,360
OK, I have three dollars.
How much do you have?

758
00:59:20,236 --> 00:59:22,447
- Six bucks.
- Let me go up and order, so we can go.

759
00:59:22,655 --> 00:59:26,159
OK. I'll have a chicken breast sandwich.
No skin, dry toast.

760
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:34,459
<i>You make me dizzy,
running circles in my head</i>

761
00:59:34,626 --> 00:59:41,257
<i>One of these days I'll chase you down</i>

762
00:59:41,466 --> 00:59:44,052
<i>Well, look who's going crazy now</i>

763
00:59:44,218 --> 00:59:46,596
<i>We're face to face, my friend</i>

764
00:59:46,804 --> 00:59:49,641
<i>Better get out</i>

765
00:59:49,807 --> 00:59:52,560
<i>Better get out!</i>

766
00:59:52,727 --> 00:59:54,979
- What are you starin' at, fucker?
- <i>You know you make me break out...</i>

767
00:59:57,231 --> 00:59:59,734
Wanna start me up? Just pull the cord, pal.

768
00:59:59,943 --> 01:00:03,279
I'm due for a seismic event.
You're dancin' on the fault line.

769
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:08,159
- Hey, what is your problem, pal?
- I got no beef with you. Just the kid.

770
01:00:08,743 --> 01:00:11,412
- Hey, stop it!
- He started it.

771
01:00:11,621 --> 01:00:14,540
I'm so sorry. I apologise.
He suffers from this thing.

772
01:00:14,707 --> 01:00:16,918
I'm standing right here, four-eyes.

773
01:00:17,126 --> 01:00:21,422
Oh, poor baby. Has to let his daddy
fight his battles for him, huh?

774
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,591
He's an ass.

775
01:00:30,098 --> 01:00:31,975
Pussy.

776
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:38,773
How's it hangin', fellas?

777
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:41,192
Hank, I presume.

778
01:00:43,361 --> 01:00:46,030
- D'you miss me?
- Why don't you get Charlie back?

779
01:00:46,197 --> 01:00:48,491
Things were finally becoming civilised.

780
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,161
Pocahontas, you gotta put your ear
to the ground to hear the buffalo.

781
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:54,455
I don't know what that means, OK?

782
01:00:54,914 --> 01:00:59,877
It means either he makes up a battle plan,
or Hank'll take over Fort Charlie for good.

783
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:04,090
Did you just refer to yourself
in the fourth person?

784
01:01:04,424 --> 01:01:07,510
Holy Jesus in heaven! It's a giant Q-Tip.

785
01:01:07,677 --> 01:01:08,886
Hank!

786
01:01:09,095 --> 01:01:12,432
What? I'm jokin'.
Bringin' a little sunshine into his life.

787
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,642
Careful, you'll peel.

788
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:18,896
- Do you need to see a menu?
- No, thank you. We've ordered.

789
01:01:25,194 --> 01:01:26,446
That's it.

790
01:01:27,864 --> 01:01:31,993
- Hold on, cheese tits. Did I miss something?
- Don't give me that shit!

791
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,746
What you just did to that kid was terrible.

792
01:01:34,954 --> 01:01:37,415
Didn't you see the look on his face?

793
01:01:40,209 --> 01:01:42,378
Looked a little pale, that's all.

794
01:01:42,587 --> 01:01:45,006
He was hurt and offended.

795
01:01:45,214 --> 01:01:47,592
Well, I disagree, but why speculate?

796
01:01:48,593 --> 01:01:51,512
- Hey, Milky! ¡<i>Vámonos</i>!
- Hey, no!

797
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:55,767
Come on, Br'er Rabbit.
Hop down the bunny trail. <i>Epa, epa, ándale</i>.

798
01:01:56,976 --> 01:02:01,898
Listen, were you offended in any way
by our social interaction here?

799
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:04,233
Yeah, actually I was.

800
01:02:07,153 --> 01:02:08,863
What was it? The Q-Tip thing?

801
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:12,617
Actually I was pretty much offended
by everything you said, sir.

802
01:02:20,249 --> 01:02:22,126
Sorry.

803
01:02:25,254 --> 01:02:27,298
I'm truly sorry.

804
01:02:48,903 --> 01:02:50,780
You OK?

805
01:02:53,283 --> 01:02:55,243
You don't know what it was like.

806
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:59,122
Spending all those years
trapped behind a wall of politeness.

807
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,207
Bound and gagged...

808
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:06,004
in a dark and silent world
where nothing grows but the anger.

809
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:14,137
All because some demon he married laced up
her boots and did a Nancy Sinatra on him.

810
01:03:14,345 --> 01:03:16,598
Charlie had a wife?

811
01:03:17,807 --> 01:03:20,101
And then some.

812
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:23,229
I was a big piece
of the personality pie back then.

813
01:03:23,396 --> 01:03:26,399
But when she left him, Charlie went numb...

814
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:28,276
and I went AWOL.

815
01:03:29,235 --> 01:03:31,112
Well,

816
01:03:32,322 --> 01:03:35,241
if you were
such a big part of the personality,

817
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:38,036
then she left you too.

818
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:48,838
It's true.

819
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:54,260
She left us.

820
01:03:56,387 --> 01:03:58,264
I loved her.

821
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:03,227
Why'd she do this?

822
01:04:04,312 --> 01:04:06,481
I'm not a bad person.

823
01:04:08,066 --> 01:04:10,234
I'm not a bad person.

824
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:13,780
No, you're not a bad guy.

825
01:04:13,988 --> 01:04:16,032
No, you're not.

826
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,951
D'you hear me?

827
01:04:22,121 --> 01:04:24,290
You're a good person.

828
01:04:28,294 --> 01:04:30,296
You really think so?

829
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:33,925
Yeah, I'm starting to.

830
01:04:43,977 --> 01:04:46,104
You know what I'm gonna do?

831
01:04:46,896 --> 01:04:49,107
I'm gonna make it up to Charlie.

832
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:53,945
And I'm gonna make it up
to that sweet little circus geek in there.

833
01:04:56,864 --> 01:04:58,408
Hank?

834
01:05:00,034 --> 01:05:04,747
Agent Boshane! They were spotted leaving
a health-food restaurant 100 miles from here.

835
01:05:04,956 --> 01:05:07,000
- 15 minutes, tops.
- Got it.

836
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,551
They got 150 cordoned off?

837
01:05:17,802 --> 01:05:19,679
Let's fly!

838
01:05:39,407 --> 01:05:42,160
Can you please tell him to stop this?

839
01:05:42,368 --> 01:05:44,537
Charlie, is that you?

840
01:05:48,499 --> 01:05:50,376
Hey, my nose.

841
01:05:51,419 --> 01:05:54,005
My nose is fixed.

842
01:05:55,798 --> 01:05:59,260
- Isn't that great?
- How'd that happen?

843
01:05:59,469 --> 01:06:04,098
Well, Hank wanted
to do something nice for you,

844
01:06:04,265 --> 01:06:08,728
so he insisted that we
go to a plastic surgeon.

845
01:06:08,937 --> 01:06:12,607
What? Did you say plastic surgeon?

846
01:06:12,815 --> 01:06:14,359
Oh, my God.

847
01:06:15,276 --> 01:06:16,653
What is this?

848
01:06:16,861 --> 01:06:19,197
What d'you... what is this?

849
01:06:19,989 --> 01:06:24,202
Hank thought that you kinda
had a weak chin, so...

850
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:27,288
What?

851
01:06:31,417 --> 01:06:33,127
I like my chin.

852
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:35,797
It's my chin! It's my chin! Mine!

853
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:37,382
How'd you pay for it?

854
01:06:37,548 --> 01:06:39,425
I loaned him the money.

855
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,929
Who the hell are you?

856
01:06:43,096 --> 01:06:44,472
It's me.

857
01:06:44,931 --> 01:06:46,557
Milky.

858
01:06:51,479 --> 01:06:54,065
Who the hell is Milky
and what is he doing here?

859
01:06:56,734 --> 01:07:00,405
Irene has a lot of people who would like
to see her in an unmarked grave.

860
01:07:00,613 --> 01:07:03,366
I don't think it's safe
for you to hang around with us.

861
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:07,412
Why not?
You, Irene and Hank are my only friends.

862
01:07:08,454 --> 01:07:11,207
What about your family?
Won't they miss you?

863
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:13,293
My family's all...

864
01:07:14,502 --> 01:07:16,212
They're gone.

865
01:07:17,255 --> 01:07:19,132
Oh, jeez.

866
01:07:27,015 --> 01:07:30,602
Well, we can't call you Milky any more.
What's your real name?

867
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:33,896
Casper. But my friends call me Whitey.

868
01:07:35,898 --> 01:07:37,442
OK.

869
01:07:41,404 --> 01:07:46,242
<i>I can't find the time to tell you</i>

870
01:07:51,205 --> 01:07:55,960
<i>I can't find the time to tell you...</i>

871
01:07:56,628 --> 01:07:58,087
Whoa!

872
01:07:58,504 --> 01:08:00,840
<i>So many things to say</i>

873
01:08:01,049 --> 01:08:07,305
<i>I could fit it in a book, fit it in a book
of a thousand pages, yeah</i>

874
01:08:08,222 --> 01:08:10,808
<i>So many people say</i>

875
01:08:10,975 --> 01:08:16,022
<i>That I couldn't tell a lie, couldn't tell a lie
in a thousand ages</i>

876
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:19,901
- Here you go. I got your car all filled up.
- Thank you, Joseph.

877
01:08:22,695 --> 01:08:24,739
Oh, yeah.

878
01:08:27,575 --> 01:08:30,411
Get your cock out of my Chrysler,
you son of a bitch!

879
01:08:33,206 --> 01:08:37,585
You son of a...!
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna get you!

880
01:08:43,758 --> 01:08:48,554
<i>I can't find the time to tell you</i>

881
01:08:50,598 --> 01:08:53,434
<i>I look at your pretty face</i>

882
01:08:53,643 --> 01:08:56,062
<i>And I fall in love with you,
fall in love with you</i>

883
01:08:56,271 --> 01:09:00,566
<i>Every time I see you there</i>

884
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:05,822
<i>They are flowing to the ground,
flowing to the ground</i>

885
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:09,284
<i>In a mist around you</i>

886
01:09:10,451 --> 01:09:13,705
<i>Baby, you're wrong</i>

887
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:18,626
<i>Baby, you're wrong</i>

888
01:09:18,876 --> 01:09:21,337
What's that on your shirt?

889
01:09:23,172 --> 01:09:25,049
I'm sorry.

890
01:09:26,634 --> 01:09:28,428
That was good.

891
01:09:29,137 --> 01:09:32,056
Charlie, what the hell is that?

892
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:35,810
- Oh, yeah, I'm gonna fall for that.
- No, Charlie.

893
01:09:36,644 --> 01:09:38,521
Not me.

894
01:09:38,688 --> 01:09:40,565
Nice try though.

895
01:09:40,773 --> 01:09:42,984
How dumb do I look?

896
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:55,371
<i>I can't find the time to tell you</i>

897
01:09:55,538 --> 01:10:00,543
<i>I can't find the time to tell you...</i>

898
01:10:03,171 --> 01:10:05,923
Hey, they only had two rooms: 19 and 20.

899
01:10:06,132 --> 01:10:08,217
So you guys will have to bunk up.

900
01:10:10,762 --> 01:10:16,684
<i>I can't find the time to tell you</i>

901
01:10:21,147 --> 01:10:23,399
So, Whitey...

902
01:10:24,567 --> 01:10:26,527
What happened to your family?

903
01:10:26,736 --> 01:10:28,738
I killed them.

904
01:10:30,198 --> 01:10:31,741
Come again?

905
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:36,412
When I was 15, I hacked them up
with a hammer while they were sleeping.

906
01:10:36,621 --> 01:10:40,041
Ma, Dad, my bro and my sis.

907
01:10:42,752 --> 01:10:44,629
She was awake, my sis.

908
01:10:46,839 --> 01:10:48,716
Which I regret.

909
01:10:50,635 --> 01:10:52,512
Yeah, well...

910
01:10:53,805 --> 01:10:57,058
We all have family stuff.

911
01:10:58,768 --> 01:11:02,522
That's what makes the holidays so hard.

912
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:05,733
I just got released last month
on my 21st birthday.

913
01:11:07,193 --> 01:11:12,240
To tell you the truth, I really wasn't ready
to leave, but they said I had to.

914
01:11:14,826 --> 01:11:16,703
That's a fucked-up law, huh?

915
01:11:19,122 --> 01:11:23,167
Well, I guess they need the extra room
for the real...

916
01:11:23,376 --> 01:11:24,544
psychos.

917
01:11:24,752 --> 01:11:27,588
I'm gonna go and try
to make out with what's her face.

918
01:11:27,755 --> 01:11:29,299
- Go for it.
- All right!

919
01:11:31,593 --> 01:11:37,098
He just told me that he brutally murdered
his entire family in their sleep!

920
01:11:37,599 --> 01:11:40,685
- Oh, my God!
- He was a juvenile. They just let him out.

921
01:11:43,146 --> 01:11:48,026
So, I was gonna ask if I could...

922
01:11:48,234 --> 01:11:50,486
stay here.

923
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,072
But I can sleep in the car.

924
01:11:58,411 --> 01:12:01,331
That's me and my whippersnappers.
I'm Dorothy.

925
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:04,334
Look at you!

926
01:12:06,461 --> 01:12:09,589
When did you take this?
At Halloween?

927
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:12,133
No. Just messing around the house.

928
01:12:16,846 --> 01:12:19,349
You seem like a really good dad, Charlie.

929
01:12:23,269 --> 01:12:25,605
I try to be.

930
01:12:26,397 --> 01:12:29,484
They're incredible kids. Oh, God.

931
01:12:29,817 --> 01:12:34,364
So happy and funny.
They never give me any grief.

932
01:12:35,448 --> 01:12:39,118
- They're the top three students out of 211.
- Golly!

933
01:12:39,327 --> 01:12:42,705
- I don't know where they get it from.
- That's just good genes.

934
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:51,923
You know, I don't think I... No, I don't think
I carry even one picture any more.

935
01:12:52,632 --> 01:12:55,301
- Why not?
- I don't know.

936
01:12:55,468 --> 01:13:00,473
I used to when I was younger.
Pictures of friends and stuff like that.

937
01:13:00,682 --> 01:13:03,601
I guess they just got old and fell apart.

938
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:08,606
Kind of like the friendships.

939
01:13:10,525 --> 01:13:12,402
That's too bad.

940
01:13:17,865 --> 01:13:21,828
- Tell you what. Why not keep that one?
- No, Charlie. That's yours.

941
01:13:22,036 --> 01:13:25,873
Are you kidding? I have tons of them
at home. No, I got a bunch. Come on.

942
01:13:26,082 --> 01:13:27,959
- You do?
- Yeah.

943
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:30,461
OK.

944
01:13:31,045 --> 01:13:32,922
Thanks.

945
01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:36,759
Thanks.

946
01:13:50,815 --> 01:13:52,692
I'm dry.

947
01:13:55,695 --> 01:13:58,698
You know, I'm gonna go get a soda.

948
01:13:58,906 --> 01:14:02,452
- You want a soda?
- Sure. OK.

949
01:14:24,182 --> 01:14:27,185
I caught that, bozo.
Not once but twice it burned ya.

950
01:14:31,814 --> 01:14:33,858
Give it another kick.

951
01:14:41,824 --> 01:14:44,494
- I think I just had an epiphany!
- What?

952
01:14:44,661 --> 01:14:47,914
That I might be able to control
this problem of mine.

953
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:50,375
How'd you learn that?

954
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:54,128
First the coke machine robbed me.
And I'm fine with that.

955
01:14:54,337 --> 01:14:57,340
But then some guy came up
and laughed in my face.

956
01:14:57,507 --> 01:15:00,343
- Oh, no.
- No, no, but that's just it!

957
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:04,222
See? Just when I was starting to feel
those old familiar feelings,

958
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:08,893
I just took a deep breath, counted
backwards from ten and I said to the guy

959
01:15:09,102 --> 01:15:12,730
"Excuse me, sir, but your laughter
is not helping me right now."

960
01:15:12,939 --> 01:15:18,778
And he said "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make
fun." That was it! I helped him with his bags.

961
01:15:18,945 --> 01:15:20,822
- Really?
- Yes.

962
01:15:20,989 --> 01:15:22,949
Well, that's great!

963
01:15:23,116 --> 01:15:25,159
And you got the cokes.

964
01:15:25,368 --> 01:15:28,788
Just a little rap on the side
of the machine and presto!

965
01:15:28,997 --> 01:15:31,124
Maybe that's it though, you know?

966
01:15:33,793 --> 01:15:38,423
- Look what I found in my bag.
- Oh, no! Oh, boy.

967
01:15:38,881 --> 01:15:40,758
What do you think? Do you?

968
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:45,763
Under the right circumstances,
sure, I could tip a few.

969
01:15:46,681 --> 01:15:49,350
And these are the right circumstances.

970
01:15:50,602 --> 01:15:51,811
There you go.

971
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:54,939
- <i>Celebrate good times, come on</i>
- Oh, well.

972
01:15:55,106 --> 01:15:56,899
Whoa, that must be mine!

973
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:51,996
Jesus! Oh, God.

974
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:54,457
Oh, my God!

975
01:17:11,057 --> 01:17:12,934
Irene?

976
01:17:15,103 --> 01:17:17,855
Why am I peeing
like I was up all night having sex?

977
01:17:19,107 --> 01:17:22,026
<i>Well, seems old Hank had pulled a fast one.</i>

978
01:17:22,277 --> 01:17:27,699
<i>And if that wasn't bad enough, there was
more trouble right around the corner.</i>

979
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:33,705
I want everybody to stay put
and wait for my order.

980
01:17:33,997 --> 01:17:38,042
- You mean you couldn't tell the difference?
- Are you serious?

981
01:17:39,544 --> 01:17:43,172
- Who the hell could?
- A sober person for one.

982
01:17:43,756 --> 01:17:46,092
So we had some drinks.

983
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,019
Well, look who joined the party.

984
01:17:58,271 --> 01:18:02,025
Did you have fun?
"Ooh, yes, I did! Ooh, yes I did!"

985
01:18:02,984 --> 01:18:05,653
So old Hanky-Panky
wasn't enough for you, huh?

986
01:18:07,196 --> 01:18:09,073
It wasn't for me.

987
01:18:13,786 --> 01:18:15,997
- Are you sure this is the woman?
- Absolutely.

988
01:18:16,205 --> 01:18:20,335
When my boyfriend Scooter brought in
the paper, I recognised her right away.

989
01:18:22,837 --> 01:18:25,048
Thanks a lot. Scooter.

990
01:18:32,472 --> 01:18:35,391
- Here they come.
- Look, Starsky and Hutch, this is the plan.

991
01:18:35,558 --> 01:18:38,645
Let us talk to our dad
so this ain't gotta be no big thing.

992
01:18:38,811 --> 01:18:43,441
Thanks, but this is the end of the line for you.
Officer Stubie'll drive you to the chopper.

993
01:18:43,608 --> 01:18:47,028
What? You brung us all the way down
for us to leave now?

994
01:18:47,236 --> 01:18:51,282
- That don't make no motherfuckin' sense!
- You've done all you can do.

995
01:18:51,449 --> 01:18:53,618
This is a police matter from now on.

996
01:18:53,826 --> 01:18:59,248
Wait. It may be a police matter, but the police
don't matter shit when it's my daddy in there!

997
01:18:59,707 --> 01:19:03,503
I said you're gettin' the hell outta here.
That's the end of it.

998
01:19:05,672 --> 01:19:09,467
Guys, look, I'm sorry.
I hate to admit it, but this time he's right.

999
01:19:09,676 --> 01:19:13,012
- You can't be here. It's a liability.
- He's the fuckin' liability!

1000
01:19:13,221 --> 01:19:17,058
Don't worry. This is my investigation.
I promise there will be no bloodshed.

1001
01:19:17,267 --> 01:19:19,060
I promise!

1002
01:19:20,228 --> 01:19:22,188
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1003
01:19:26,859 --> 01:19:28,736
You OK, Charlie?

1004
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:31,447
Yeah. I'm just...

1005
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:34,075
freshening up!

1006
01:19:38,746 --> 01:19:40,999
How do you wanna handle it?

1007
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:46,087
I say we storm the place and start shooting.

1008
01:19:46,296 --> 01:19:49,674
- What if he's unarmed?
- Plant a gun on him afterwards.

1009
01:19:55,305 --> 01:19:57,515
Don't fuck it up this time.

1010
01:20:19,662 --> 01:20:21,539
Agent Boshane!

1011
01:20:22,832 --> 01:20:25,668
It's Stubie. He's got Baileygates and the girl.

1012
01:20:26,336 --> 01:20:28,212
What?

1013
01:20:32,342 --> 01:20:34,177
This is Boshane. What's going on?

1014
01:20:34,385 --> 01:20:37,972
<i>I caught 'em out on 134 in a stolen vehicle.
Baileygates and the girl.</i>

1015
01:20:38,181 --> 01:20:41,184
Officer Stubie,
I don't want you to attempt to move them.

1016
01:20:41,392 --> 01:20:45,229
- Don't move them! We'll be right there.
- Get in your cars. Come on!

1017
01:20:47,315 --> 01:20:51,361
We sure is sorry, Officer,
but our daddy told us to trust our instinct,

1018
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:54,989
and our instinct says
somethin' don't smell right. Let's roll.

1019
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:57,617
You guys are making a big mistake!

1020
01:20:57,825 --> 01:21:02,205
Cos I promise you, when I find your old man,
I'm personally gonna fuck him up!

1021
01:21:06,084 --> 01:21:09,003
Why'd you go an' say
somethin' like that for, huh?

1022
01:21:09,212 --> 01:21:10,588
Lee Harvey.

1023
01:21:10,797 --> 01:21:13,132
- What's the diameter of a chicken egg?
- 4.08cm.

1024
01:21:13,341 --> 01:21:16,761
- No, what's that in inches?
- 1.61. What the fuck you gettin' at?

1025
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:20,306
I got ten bucks say
I can squeeze a chicken egg up his ass.

1026
01:21:20,473 --> 01:21:23,393
You can't put no chicken egg up his ass.
He's a tightass!

1027
01:21:23,559 --> 01:21:25,812
- No, it can be done.
- Yo, I'll take that bet.

1028
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:27,897
- Right on.
- Pull yo' ass out!

1029
01:21:36,823 --> 01:21:40,618
I'll tell you one thing. If I didn't have bad luck,
I'd have no luck at all.

1030
01:21:40,827 --> 01:21:45,206
- What are we gonna do about Whitey?
- Take a guess. We're going on without him.

1031
01:21:45,373 --> 01:21:47,166
Moody.

1032
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:52,422
Well, I didn't have the fun you had last night.
Just the hangover and the swollen prostate.

1033
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:57,093
- D'you have any cash left?
- Yes. $60, but it's Whitey's.

1034
01:21:57,260 --> 01:22:01,848
Yeah, well, bad things happen to people
who kill their family with a hammer.

1035
01:22:07,312 --> 01:22:09,897
- I'm payin' under protest.
- It was close enough.

1036
01:22:10,064 --> 01:22:11,941
Yeah, whatever.

1037
01:22:13,985 --> 01:22:15,194
Shit.

1038
01:22:15,403 --> 01:22:18,656
Give me the scanner,
so we can find out what the fuck's goin' on!

1039
01:22:18,865 --> 01:22:20,825
Anybody know how to fly this thing?

1040
01:22:20,992 --> 01:22:24,078
Motherfucker,
it's just lift versus drag and rotation!

1041
01:22:24,245 --> 01:22:28,291
- Yeah, get your head out your ass!
- It ain't that. This manual's in German.

1042
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:33,046
- Motherfucker, you speak German!
- I can speak it. I didn't say I could read it!

1043
01:22:33,254 --> 01:22:35,298
You's a motherfuckin' disgrace!

1044
01:22:44,891 --> 01:22:49,437
- Then get this motherfucker off the ground!
- All right! Oh, shit!

1045
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:08,581
Jesus!

1046
01:23:12,168 --> 01:23:16,214
Would somebody get this goddamn chicken
out of my ass, please? Oh!

1047
01:23:29,477 --> 01:23:34,315
Everybody, stay back. We'll do this alone.
I'll take 19, you take 20. Stay back!

1048
01:23:42,532 --> 01:23:44,409
Goddamn it!

1049
01:23:47,161 --> 01:23:50,415
Sons of bitches, I'll show 'em.
Sons of bitches.

1050
01:23:52,083 --> 01:23:55,336
- I need a gun and lots of ammo.
- Sorry.

1051
01:23:55,545 --> 01:23:58,006
72-hour wait. Federal law.

1052
01:23:58,214 --> 01:24:02,093
- How far am I from Rhode Island?
- Four or five hours.

1053
01:24:02,302 --> 01:24:05,763
Got a map of New England,
if you want. $1.95.

1054
01:24:07,098 --> 01:24:10,268
- Here's a five. Keep the change.
- Thanks.

1055
01:24:21,487 --> 01:24:24,073
- Hello.
- <i>Finneran, it's Charlie.</i>

1056
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:27,076
Charlie, you are in deep shit.
Where the hell are you?

1057
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:29,829
Listen, you gotta get a message
to the colonel.

1058
01:24:30,038 --> 01:24:34,417
But no one outside the department
can know about this, OK? Cos this is deep.

1059
01:24:35,209 --> 01:24:39,339
4.30, South county train station.
Bring plenty of backup. You got it.

1060
01:24:39,505 --> 01:24:44,510
Don't worry. Nobody outside the department
will hear about this. Watch yourself, buddy.

1061
01:24:47,221 --> 01:24:49,098
4.30, huh?

1062
01:24:49,265 --> 01:24:53,227
Thanks for notifying us, Officer.
No, you've been a really big help.

1063
01:24:53,436 --> 01:24:55,313
- You stay close.
- Yes, sir.

1064
01:24:56,648 --> 01:24:58,524
Excuse me.

1065
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:03,112
- Where's Dickie?
- He's waiting for us in Boston.

1066
01:25:03,321 --> 01:25:06,658
I think it's time
our rich boy got his hands dirty.

1067
01:25:08,618 --> 01:25:10,244
Tell me.

1068
01:25:10,453 --> 01:25:12,080
How was...

1069
01:25:12,246 --> 01:25:14,248
Mr Wonderful?

1070
01:25:14,457 --> 01:25:18,419
This is getting really ridiculous, Charlie,
so just let it go.

1071
01:25:18,628 --> 01:25:23,257
I turn my back for one minute
and you stick it up my ass! Literally!

1072
01:25:23,424 --> 01:25:26,427
For your information,
you stuck it in your own ass!

1073
01:25:28,429 --> 01:25:32,976
Don't turn this around on me, OK? You're
the one who can't keep your legs closed.

1074
01:25:42,443 --> 01:25:45,780
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I like you.

1075
01:25:51,577 --> 01:25:53,454
What?

1076
01:25:56,165 --> 01:25:58,042
I like you.

1077
01:26:08,678 --> 01:26:10,555
I like you.

1078
01:26:11,598 --> 01:26:13,641
Well, you shouldn't, Charlie.

1079
01:26:14,851 --> 01:26:17,020
I'm just a ditz.

1080
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:21,649
A ditz? What are you talking about?
You're 27 years old.

1081
01:26:22,025 --> 01:26:25,194
You're the superintendent
of a major golf resort.

1082
01:26:25,278 --> 01:26:30,325
Yeah, well, I kind of fudged my résumé
a little bit to get that job.

1083
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:37,999
Look, I don't know the first thing about
running a golf course, Charlie. I'm a model.

1084
01:26:40,293 --> 01:26:46,049
I moved to New York, but none of it worked
out, so then I tried to be an actress and...

1085
01:26:46,257 --> 01:26:49,761
I got this eating disorder
where I gained, like, 20lb.

1086
01:26:50,386 --> 01:26:52,555
- That's not that bad.
- In a week.

1087
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:56,726
So I kind of lost my self-respect.

1088
01:26:57,644 --> 01:27:01,022
Before you know it,
I had 70-year-old guys trying to support me

1089
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:03,983
and I really didn't like who I was becoming.

1090
01:27:07,654 --> 01:27:11,366
God, I have made so many mistakes.

1091
01:27:13,409 --> 01:27:15,286
Irene...

1092
01:27:17,038 --> 01:27:20,833
You didn't know
what Dickie was up to. Did you?

1093
01:27:22,293 --> 01:27:25,129
I may be a ditz, but I'm not a crook.

1094
01:27:37,684 --> 01:27:40,603
<i>When we met, light was set</i>

1095
01:27:40,812 --> 01:27:42,522
<i>Thoughts free flow</i>

1096
01:27:42,689 --> 01:27:46,067
<i>You said you've got something</i>

1097
01:27:46,776 --> 01:27:48,820
<i>Deep inside of you</i>

1098
01:27:49,696 --> 01:27:52,532
<i>A wind-chime voice sounds</i>

1099
01:27:52,699 --> 01:27:55,618
<i>Sway of your hips 'round rings true</i>

1100
01:27:55,785 --> 01:27:57,662
My ass is really sore.

1101
01:27:57,829 --> 01:28:01,499
<i>It goes deep inside of you</i>

1102
01:28:14,429 --> 01:28:17,015
I never get tired of hearing that.

1103
01:28:34,824 --> 01:28:38,620
I'm lookin' for my friends.
A pretty blonde and a guy with a buzz cut.

1104
01:28:38,828 --> 01:28:40,705
- Cabin E.
- Thanks a lot.

1105
01:28:52,842 --> 01:28:54,636
Don't make a sound.

1106
01:28:54,844 --> 01:28:57,680
I don't know anything,
and that's what I told the police.

1107
01:28:57,847 --> 01:29:01,976
Shut up, Irene! You just listen to me.
Maybe we can work something out.

1108
01:29:05,772 --> 01:29:09,192
Time to face the music, Mozart.
And one, and two, and...

1109
01:29:30,463 --> 01:29:33,132
Warden, I want my own cell.

1110
01:29:34,133 --> 01:29:36,177
Great. You again.

1111
01:29:38,596 --> 01:29:43,351
- What tree did this sap ooze out of?
- It's Dickie! He got me into all this crap!

1112
01:29:43,559 --> 01:29:45,520
- Oh, your golf buddy.
- Yeah.

1113
01:29:45,687 --> 01:29:47,814
- I hope it's OK if I play through.
- Hank!

1114
01:29:48,022 --> 01:29:50,608
- OK, turn around. I'll play the back nine.
- Stop it!

1115
01:29:50,817 --> 01:29:53,653
Come on. He couldn't have
chewed up the greens that badly.

1116
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:55,905
Get away from me!

1117
01:29:56,322 --> 01:30:00,076
He hasn't played the course in a long time.
It was Charlie who was putting.

1118
01:30:00,702 --> 01:30:02,245
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

1119
01:30:02,412 --> 01:30:05,748
He might not be long on the tee,
but he's got a good up-and-down game.

1120
01:30:05,957 --> 01:30:08,418
What's that suppo... can we speak English?

1121
01:30:08,626 --> 01:30:12,297
I never wanted to sleep with you, Hank!
OK? You tricked me!

1122
01:30:12,922 --> 01:30:17,051
That's right, I did trick you.
It was deceitful, disgusting and despicable.

1123
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:19,929
But just this once,
try to look at it from my side.

1124
01:30:20,388 --> 01:30:21,931
I was horny.

1125
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:23,683
Oh, God!

1126
01:30:23,891 --> 01:30:25,685
You are such an asshole!

1127
01:30:25,852 --> 01:30:28,313
Come on. Don't be mad, my little pussy fart.

1128
01:30:32,525 --> 01:30:34,652
I warned you about that, buddy!

1129
01:30:35,069 --> 01:30:36,946
Warned me about what?

1130
01:30:38,906 --> 01:30:41,117
Charlie?

1131
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:44,829
Providence, Rhode Island. Ten-minute stop.

1132
01:30:46,247 --> 01:30:47,123
Did you...

1133
01:30:47,332 --> 01:30:48,708
- What?
- What's going on?

1134
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:51,252
- Hank was coming on to me again.
- Hank!

1135
01:30:52,754 --> 01:30:55,506
Damn it. I am so sick of that guy!

1136
01:30:55,923 --> 01:30:59,969
OK, Hank, come out here. Let's settle this
the old-fashioned way. Come on!

1137
01:31:00,178 --> 01:31:03,097
I may not be tough,
but damn it, I can get good and mad!

1138
01:31:03,765 --> 01:31:05,642
Stop it, man. You're scaring me.

1139
01:31:06,893 --> 01:31:09,646
- What's the matter?
- Let's go before he wakes up.

1140
01:31:09,812 --> 01:31:12,982
I'm not through with you, buster.
I'm not through with you!

1141
01:31:19,781 --> 01:31:22,951
What's the matter, Hank?
Afraid to pick on someone your own size?

1142
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:28,706
Are you OK? What happened?

1143
01:31:28,915 --> 01:31:30,375
That was dirty.

1144
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:32,710
All right. Come on.

1145
01:31:32,919 --> 01:31:34,796
Where are you? Where are you?

1146
01:31:35,004 --> 01:31:36,881
Here I am.

1147
01:31:37,048 --> 01:31:38,758
You bastard!

1148
01:31:41,844 --> 01:31:44,013
Stop it, you're gonna kill him!

1149
01:31:44,931 --> 01:31:48,810
You're choking me!
You're choking me!

1150
01:31:50,812 --> 01:31:52,272
Charlie, don't break it.

1151
01:31:52,438 --> 01:31:54,691
Get on your knees and beg me. Up yours.

1152
01:32:01,948 --> 01:32:04,325
On your feet. We're gonna have fun.

1153
01:32:04,951 --> 01:32:06,494
Irene!

1154
01:32:10,915 --> 01:32:14,961
Hi, ladies. My name is
Charlie Baileygates. Wanna see my weasel?

1155
01:32:19,716 --> 01:32:23,428
Free hot dogs here. All you can eat.
Get your foot-long and a bag of nuts.

1156
01:32:23,636 --> 01:32:27,473
No! Don't listen to him!
It's not me! It's Hank!

1157
01:32:27,682 --> 01:32:28,933
It's Hank!

1158
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:35,690
Come back here, Hank!
I'm not through with you!

1159
01:32:43,406 --> 01:32:45,617
Had enough? Up yours.

1160
01:32:50,496 --> 01:32:52,040
Stop it, you two!

1161
01:32:56,711 --> 01:33:00,923
- It's Gerke! Come on!
- Hank, truce? For now, fucker.

1162
01:33:07,555 --> 01:33:09,891
Watch out! He's got a gun!

1163
01:33:10,642 --> 01:33:13,227
I'll follow the girl. You get Baileygates!

1164
01:33:19,525 --> 01:33:22,779
Police officer! Everybody down! Get down!

1165
01:33:30,411 --> 01:33:31,412
Outta the way!

1166
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:38,878
Hank, we're shot!
You pussy, it's just a flesh wound. Look.

1167
01:33:49,973 --> 01:33:54,727
Look, there's keys in that car.
No, I can't go on.

1168
01:33:56,145 --> 01:33:58,398
I think...

1169
01:33:59,107 --> 01:34:01,776
I think I'm gonna faint.

1170
01:34:09,117 --> 01:34:12,996
Do you mean to say
I've gotta carry your sorry ass?

1171
01:34:14,038 --> 01:34:15,915
All right.

1172
01:34:16,124 --> 01:34:18,710
Come on, Rip Van Wussy.

1173
01:34:22,171 --> 01:34:24,048
Jesus, you're heavy.

1174
01:34:29,178 --> 01:34:31,055
Now get in there!

1175
01:34:39,814 --> 01:34:41,524
And we're gone.

1176
01:34:45,194 --> 01:34:46,988
Shit! Don't worry.

1177
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:56,247
Hank, what have you done?! Oh, my God!
Don't you just love it?

1178
01:35:15,224 --> 01:35:17,644
You are a sick pup.

1179
01:35:17,852 --> 01:35:20,021
Yeah, well, takes one to know one.

1180
01:35:20,229 --> 01:35:22,106
What are you doing? Hank?

1181
01:35:23,775 --> 01:35:26,027
Ever been bitch-slapped?

1182
01:35:26,235 --> 01:35:28,821
I'm gonna kill you, Hank! I swear to God!

1183
01:35:30,615 --> 01:35:33,451
<i>Arrivederci, deadwood. No!</i>

1184
01:36:21,124 --> 01:36:25,586
What are you still doin' here?
Hank, we're in this together.

1185
01:36:32,635 --> 01:36:34,095
Pritchard.

1186
01:36:34,262 --> 01:36:37,599
Cover the other end.
I want Charlie arrested on sight.

1187
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,886
Hey, Irene. You just keep walking, now.

1188
01:37:26,356 --> 01:37:27,982
Irene!

1189
01:37:34,155 --> 01:37:36,157
Baileygates, you're coming with me.

1190
01:37:36,366 --> 01:37:37,909
- Not now, Finneran.
- Yes, now!

1191
01:37:41,371 --> 01:37:44,123
That was me.
Yeah, big deal.

1192
01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:46,960
- Shut up, Hank! You're so...
- Hank!

1193
01:37:47,877 --> 01:37:51,130
- Hank!
- Hey! Let her go!

1194
01:37:51,297 --> 01:37:54,300
She asked for me, asshole.
Big deal!

1195
01:37:58,346 --> 01:38:01,015
Dickie, you know I don't know anything!

1196
01:38:01,224 --> 01:38:03,101
Shut up, Irene. It's too late.

1197
01:38:11,025 --> 01:38:12,151
Hank!

1198
01:38:14,362 --> 01:38:16,072
Hank!

1199
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:18,116
- No way.
- Come on.

1200
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:32,797
Oh, no. Water.
Yeah. She's screwed. I'll buy you a beer.

1201
01:38:33,256 --> 01:38:35,216
No! We're doin' it!

1202
01:38:38,011 --> 01:38:39,887
Hank!

1203
01:38:40,054 --> 01:38:43,224
Hank! What are you doing? Give me the leg!

1204
01:38:44,350 --> 01:38:46,227
Hank, hurry!

1205
01:38:47,186 --> 01:38:49,188
This is my body!

1206
01:38:49,397 --> 01:38:51,566
Do you understand that?

1207
01:38:52,025 --> 01:38:55,862
I call the shots from now on, Hank!
I don't need you to fight my battles for me!

1208
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:59,866
If you can back down from something
this important, you're nothing at all!

1209
01:39:00,074 --> 01:39:02,744
You're nothing at all!

1210
01:39:07,373 --> 01:39:09,083
I got my leg back.

1211
01:39:09,292 --> 01:39:11,628
Oh, no. Hank!

1212
01:39:12,086 --> 01:39:13,796
I'm coming, Irene!

1213
01:39:17,926 --> 01:39:21,262
- Hank!
- It's OK, Irene.

1214
01:39:23,181 --> 01:39:25,058
Hank's gone.

1215
01:39:25,433 --> 01:39:27,769
- It's me, Charlie.
- Charlie?

1216
01:39:28,478 --> 01:39:30,438
Maybe you should go back and get help.

1217
01:39:30,605 --> 01:39:32,732
No, I can handle it.

1218
01:39:35,193 --> 01:39:37,862
I'm warning you, pal. You're gonna get hurt.

1219
01:39:39,322 --> 01:39:41,449
Be careful, Charlie!

1220
01:39:41,741 --> 01:39:45,411
- Just do what he says, Charlie!
- Back off! Just turn around! Now!

1221
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:47,830
Take it easy, Dickie. Take it easy.

1222
01:39:49,832 --> 01:39:51,626
There's nowhere to go.

1223
01:39:52,335 --> 01:39:54,212
Come on, Dickie.

1224
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:56,631
Give me the gun. Come on.

1225
01:39:59,133 --> 01:40:01,302
Come on. That's it.

1226
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:04,013
Nice and easy.

1227
01:40:15,108 --> 01:40:16,734
Where's my thumb?

1228
01:40:16,901 --> 01:40:19,112
That's kidnapping and assault!

1229
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,281
- Why stop there?
- No!

1230
01:40:22,407 --> 01:40:24,117
Oh, God!

1231
01:40:25,785 --> 01:40:27,328
Whitey!

1232
01:40:27,537 --> 01:40:29,706
Rock'n'roll!

1233
01:40:36,629 --> 01:40:37,839
Irene!

1234
01:41:13,583 --> 01:41:16,419
- Irene!
- What?

1235
01:41:16,628 --> 01:41:18,504
Oh, my God!

1236
01:41:27,847 --> 01:41:30,850
Keep goin'. Bring it down.

1237
01:41:31,351 --> 01:41:33,728
<i>We're comin', Daddy! We're comin', man!</i>

1238
01:41:33,937 --> 01:41:35,897
It's my kids!

1239
01:41:40,526 --> 01:41:43,905
<i>Hang on, Daddy!
Grab a hold of that motherfucker, man!</i>

1240
01:42:07,011 --> 01:42:09,472
So, how's my thumb lookin', Doc?

1241
01:42:09,681 --> 01:42:12,350
I'll let you know when I find it.

1242
01:42:12,517 --> 01:42:17,772
Irene, Charlie,
this is Agent Steve Parfitt, FBI.

1243
01:42:17,981 --> 01:42:20,733
You must be real proud of these maniacs.

1244
01:42:21,442 --> 01:42:22,568
Oh, I am.

1245
01:42:25,238 --> 01:42:27,573
Yeah, we're proud of this motherfucker too.

1246
01:42:28,866 --> 01:42:31,452
It's good to see you're safe, Dad.

1247
01:42:31,661 --> 01:42:35,957
<i>The colonel informed them that
all the guilty parties had been apprehended.</i>

1248
01:42:36,124 --> 01:42:38,584
<i>Gerke was arraigned
at a Providence hospital,</i>

1249
01:42:38,793 --> 01:42:43,172
<i>and Agent Boshane had been arrested
at the train station in New London.</i>

1250
01:42:43,423 --> 01:42:46,676
<i>But Charlie Baileygates
had other things on his mind.</i>

1251
01:42:47,302 --> 01:42:50,138
- Charlie, nicely done.
- Thanks, Sea Bass.

1252
01:42:51,598 --> 01:42:56,394
Hey, Whitey. Listen, I wanted to tell you that
I really appreciate everything you did for me.

1253
01:42:56,603 --> 01:42:58,563
I owe you a huge one.

1254
01:42:59,063 --> 01:43:02,442
And I'm truly sorry
that you had to kill again.

1255
01:43:03,318 --> 01:43:06,988
- Must be messing with your head.
- I never killed anyone before.

1256
01:43:07,697 --> 01:43:11,034
- What?
- You're a schizo who's wanted for murder,

1257
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:15,330
and you're laying in bed next to me
gabbing like a 16-year-old girl on the phone.

1258
01:43:15,538 --> 01:43:17,248
You freaked me out, man.

1259
01:43:17,707 --> 01:43:21,044
But what about your family?
How did they die?

1260
01:43:21,586 --> 01:43:23,921
I never said they were dead.

1261
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:26,090
I said they were gone.

1262
01:43:26,257 --> 01:43:28,509
They moved to Phoenix, the bastards.

1263
01:43:28,718 --> 01:43:31,721
Look at me.
I wouldn't last two minutes in the desert.

1264
01:43:33,222 --> 01:43:35,266
Hey, your bandage is wet.

1265
01:43:35,475 --> 01:43:38,144
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe it's time to come off.

1266
01:43:39,145 --> 01:43:41,356
I'm surprised it's held on this long.

1267
01:43:42,315 --> 01:43:44,025
Hey, that's not so bad.

1268
01:43:45,276 --> 01:43:47,612
Hey, Daddy, we just wanted to say that...

1269
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:49,864
Holy shit!

1270
01:43:50,073 --> 01:43:52,116
Look, Daddy got a butthole on his face.

1271
01:43:53,534 --> 01:43:55,662
Oh, boy. Here we go.

1272
01:43:56,663 --> 01:43:59,248
He sure is a Spartacus-lookin' motherfucker.

1273
01:43:59,707 --> 01:44:04,379
Hey, Daddy, now you can blow your nose
and wipe your ass at the same damn time!

1274
01:44:11,177 --> 01:44:13,304
You know what I'm saying?

1275
01:44:21,688 --> 01:44:23,564
- So...
- So...

1276
01:44:24,607 --> 01:44:28,653
- How'd your meeting with the shrink go?
- Wonderful.

1277
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:31,739
Clean bill of health.
A well-rounded individual.

1278
01:44:32,407 --> 01:44:35,660
That's great, Charlie. I'm really happy for you.

1279
01:44:36,077 --> 01:44:37,620
Thank you.

1280
01:44:38,288 --> 01:44:39,831
Well...

1281
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:42,750
I hope if you're ever... you know...

1282
01:44:43,501 --> 01:44:45,378
around here, you'll...

1283
01:44:47,422 --> 01:44:49,132
come and visit us.

1284
01:44:49,799 --> 01:44:51,342
Yeah.

1285
01:44:51,801 --> 01:44:55,179
- Little Rhodie.
- Biggest little state in the union.

1286
01:45:04,897 --> 01:45:07,567
- Let me get that for you.
- Thanks.

1287
01:45:10,778 --> 01:45:13,239
- Hey, Irene?
- Yeah?

1288
01:45:15,241 --> 01:45:17,619
Maybe I could
come visit you sometime soon.

1289
01:45:19,662 --> 01:45:21,039
Promise?

1290
01:45:23,499 --> 01:45:25,543
You bet.

1291
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:32,050
And that's the word of
a Rhode Island State Trooper, ma'am.

1292
01:45:58,326 --> 01:46:04,082
<i>I found you sittin' on a suitcase cryin'</i>

1293
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:12,215
<i>Beneath my feet
I feel the rumble of a subway train, yeah</i>

1294
01:46:21,683 --> 01:46:23,226
<i>The train came in breathless</i>

1295
01:46:23,393 --> 01:46:24,769
<i>The passengers restless</i>

1296
01:46:24,978 --> 01:46:28,314
<i>She said "Baby, you'll never change "</i>

1297
01:46:28,481 --> 01:46:30,358
<i>You gotta get goin'</i>

1298
01:46:30,525 --> 01:46:32,902
<i>You gotta keep goin'</i>

1299
01:46:33,111 --> 01:46:36,531
<i>Hey, the world ain't slowin' down...</i>

1300
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:38,950
You gotta be kidding.

1301
01:46:42,328 --> 01:46:44,038
<i>Hold it right there.</i>

1302
01:46:50,128 --> 01:46:52,880
Miss Waters? I'd like you
to step out of the car.

1303
01:46:53,047 --> 01:46:54,841
What did I not do now?

1304
01:46:55,049 --> 01:46:58,136
- We've reason to believe this is stolen.
- What?

1305
01:46:58,303 --> 01:47:01,472
No, no, I rented this car!

1306
01:47:01,889 --> 01:47:04,225
Would you step out of the car, please?

1307
01:47:06,311 --> 01:47:08,313
Great.

1308
01:47:10,356 --> 01:47:12,942
Front of the car, please.
Hands on the hood.

1309
01:47:13,151 --> 01:47:14,694
Spread your legs.

1310
01:47:14,902 --> 01:47:18,281
- That's great.
- Thank you. Following procedure, ma'am.

1311
01:47:19,907 --> 01:47:21,868
Oh, you guys!

1312
01:47:22,285 --> 01:47:26,581
You guys are beautiful! Look,
why don't we skip the trial, get right to it?

1313
01:47:26,789 --> 01:47:29,375
You can lock me up
and keep me here for ever!

1314
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,463
That's what I had planned.

1315
01:47:34,672 --> 01:47:35,882
Look.

1316
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:42,055
- I hope her little skinny ass is reading this.
- Man, I'm pretty sure she's lookin', man.

1317
01:47:47,644 --> 01:47:49,520
Oh, Charlie.

1318
01:48:10,833 --> 01:48:13,503
It's gonna be raining wine and roses tonight.

1319
01:48:13,711 --> 01:48:19,717
It'll be rainin' my motherfuckin' cookies if this
motherfucker don't stop this turbulence shit!

1320
01:48:19,884 --> 01:48:23,471
<i>Well, that's Charlie's story,
and I'm sticking to it.</i>

1321
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,642
<i>They all moved in together
and lived as one big happy family.</i>

1322
01:48:27,934 --> 01:48:33,189
<i>Charlie and Irene, the guys,
even that nice albino fella, Whitey.</i>

1323
01:48:33,398 --> 01:48:36,818
<i>And I'm happy to report
Charlie got promoted to lieutenant</i>

1324
01:48:37,026 --> 01:48:43,491
<i>in the greatest law enforcement agency
in the land: the Rhode Island State Police.</i>

1325
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:46,786
<i>Yeah, it was a regular slice of Americana.</i>

1326
01:48:47,161 --> 01:48:50,790
Y'all come back now! Thanks
for watching our motherfuckin' movie!

1327
01:48:52,583 --> 01:48:53,668
<i>You gotta get goin'</i>

1328
01:48:54,669 --> 01:48:56,838
<i>You gotta keep goin'</i>

1329
01:48:57,046 --> 01:49:00,466
<i>Hey, the world ain't slowin' down</i>

1330
01:49:00,675 --> 01:49:02,135
<i>For no one</i>

1331
01:49:02,343 --> 01:49:05,513
<i>It's a carnival callin' out to you</i>

1332
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:08,516
<i>It's callin' out to you</i>

1333
01:49:08,725 --> 01:49:10,518
<i>It sounds like a song</i>

1334
01:49:10,727 --> 01:49:12,604
<i>It hits you like scripture</i>

1335
01:49:12,854 --> 01:49:17,609
<i>You paint the picture
with colours squeezed from your hand</i>

1336
01:49:17,817 --> 01:49:21,696
<i>Weren't you the kid
who just climbed on the merry-go...</i>

1337
01:49:21,904 --> 01:49:25,700
<i>Weren't you the kid
who just climbed on the merry-go...</i>

1338
01:49:25,908 --> 01:49:30,705
<i>Weren't you the kid
who just climbed on the merry-go-round?</i>

1339
01:49:30,913 --> 01:49:35,585
<i>Hey, look, the world ain't slowin' down</i>

1340
01:49:37,712 --> 01:49:39,672
<i>Hey, hey</i>

1341
01:49:39,964 --> 01:49:43,885
<i>The world ain't slowin' down</i>

1342
01:49:45,678 --> 01:49:47,305
<i>Hey, hey</i>

1343
01:49:48,723 --> 01:49:51,809
<i>It's a big blue world</i>

1344
01:49:52,685 --> 01:49:55,855
<i>It's a big blue world</i>

1345
01:49:56,064 --> 01:50:04,572
<i>We're ridin' on a big blue world</i>

1346
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:50,493
<i>In the mornin' you go gunnin'</i>

1347
01:50:50,702 --> 01:50:54,372
<i>For the man who stole your water</i>

1348
01:50:54,580 --> 01:50:58,042
<i>Then you fire till he's done in</i>

1349
01:50:58,251 --> 01:51:01,921
<i>But they catch you at the border</i>

1350
01:51:02,130 --> 01:51:05,883
<i>And the mourners are all singin'</i>

1351
01:51:06,092 --> 01:51:09,804
<i>As they drag you by your feet</i>

1352
01:51:10,013 --> 01:51:13,641
<i>But the hangman isn't hangin'</i>

1353
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:17,895
<i>And they put you on the street</i>

1354
01:51:18,146 --> 01:51:20,398
<i>You go back, Jack</i>

1355
01:51:20,607 --> 01:51:22,859
<i>Do it again</i>

1356
01:51:23,067 --> 01:51:25,653
<i>Wheels turnin' round and round</i>

1357
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:28,114
<i>You go back, Jack</i>

1358
01:51:28,323 --> 01:51:31,909
<i>Do it again</i>

1359
01:51:38,374 --> 01:51:40,001
<i>When you know you're no high climber</i>

1360
01:51:40,209 --> 01:51:41,919
<i>And you find out your only friend</i>

1361
01:51:42,086 --> 01:51:43,880
<i>In a room with a two-timer</i>

1362
01:51:44,088 --> 01:51:45,965
<i>And you're sure you're near the end</i>

1363
01:51:46,132 --> 01:51:47,842
<i>Then you love a little wild one</i>

1364
01:51:48,051 --> 01:51:49,844
<i>You bring to her a smile and then I saw one</i>

1365
01:51:50,053 --> 01:51:52,430
<i>All the time that you know you're smilin'</i>

1366
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:56,017
<i>Your black cards can make you money</i>

1367
01:51:56,225 --> 01:51:59,979
<i>So you hide them when you're able</i>

1368
01:52:00,188 --> 01:52:03,900
<i>In the land of milk and honey</i>

1369
01:52:04,108 --> 01:52:08,029
<i>You must put them on the table</i>

1370
01:52:08,237 --> 01:52:10,657
<i>You go back, Jack</i>

1371
01:52:10,865 --> 01:52:13,034
<i>Do it again</i>

1372
01:52:13,242 --> 01:52:15,912
<i>Wheels turnin' round and round</i>

1373
01:52:16,079 --> 01:52:18,414
<i>You go back, Jack</i>

1374
01:52:18,623 --> 01:52:22,835
<i>Do it again</i>

1375
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,768
<i>Hope unknown</i>

1376
01:53:20,977 --> 01:53:23,146
<i>Sometimes just waking is surreal</i>

1377
01:53:23,354 --> 01:53:26,441
<i>I walk right through the nameless ones</i>

1378
01:53:26,649 --> 01:53:29,902
<i>I know that hope's unknown</i>

1379
01:53:30,069 --> 01:53:32,155
<i>Sometimes the water feels so real</i>

1380
01:53:32,363 --> 01:53:34,741
<i>As I walk through, it fills my lungs</i>

1381
01:53:34,949 --> 01:53:36,492
<i>My God, I'm drowning</i>

1382
01:53:36,659 --> 01:53:41,039
<i>This day never seems to end, this pain never</i>

1383
01:53:41,205 --> 01:53:43,082
<i>This day never seems to</i>

1384
01:53:43,291 --> 01:53:46,794
<i>This rage I cannot let go</i>

1385
01:53:47,003 --> 01:53:48,963
<i>I hear them calling</i>

1386
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:51,341
<i>I feel them gnawing</i>

1387
01:53:52,425 --> 01:53:55,678
<i>Holes through flawless souls</i>

1388
01:53:55,845 --> 01:53:57,889
<i>I hear them calling</i>

1389
01:53:58,097 --> 01:54:00,224
<i>I feel them gnawing</i>

1390
01:54:01,392 --> 01:54:04,729
<i>Holes through flawless souls</i>

1391
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:15,073
<i>So alone</i>

1392
01:54:15,281 --> 01:54:17,450
<i>Sometimes I swear that I can hear</i>

1393
01:54:17,659 --> 01:54:20,828
<i>The taunting of the voiceless ones</i>

1394
01:54:21,037 --> 01:54:24,207
<i>I fear that I alone</i>

1395
01:54:24,374 --> 01:54:26,542
<i>Fear those who finally ceased to feel</i>

1396
01:54:26,751 --> 01:54:29,003
<i>That they're alone inside this place</i>

1397
01:54:29,212 --> 01:54:31,005
<i>I am the misplaced</i>

1398
01:54:31,214 --> 01:54:35,176
<i>This day never seems to end, this pain never</i>

1399
01:54:35,385 --> 01:54:37,595
<i>This day never seems to</i>

1400
01:54:37,804 --> 01:54:40,723
<i>This rage I cannot let go</i>

1401
01:54:40,932 --> 01:54:43,101
<i>I hear them calling</i>

1402
01:54:43,309 --> 01:54:45,186
<i>I feel them gnawing</i>

1403
01:54:46,813 --> 01:54:50,066
<i>Holes through flawless souls</i>

1404
01:54:50,233 --> 01:54:51,776
<i>I hear them calling</i>

1405
01:54:55,989 --> 01:54:59,701
<i>Holes through flawless souls</i>

1406
01:55:02,245 --> 01:55:03,788
<i>Now every face looks familiar</i>

1407
01:55:03,955 --> 01:55:05,915
<i>Then every face melts away till now</i>

1408
01:55:06,124 --> 01:55:09,210
<i>Everyone, do you know
I know your deception?</i>

1409
01:55:09,419 --> 01:55:11,212
<i>Now every face looks familiar</i>

1410
01:55:11,421 --> 01:55:13,214
<i>Then every face melts away till now</i>

1411
01:55:13,423 --> 01:55:17,468
<i>Everyone, do you know
I know your deception?</i>

1412
01:55:19,178 --> 01:55:23,099
<i>I hear them calling</i>

1413
01:55:23,308 --> 01:55:25,351
<i>I feel them gnawing</i>

1414
01:55:26,853 --> 01:55:29,856
<i>Holes through flawless souls</i>

1415
01:55:30,064 --> 01:55:32,066
<i>I hear them calling</i>

1416
01:55:32,275 --> 01:55:35,612
<i>I feel them gnawing</i>

1417
01:55:35,778 --> 01:55:38,865
<i>Holes through flawless souls</i>

1418
01:55:39,073 --> 01:55:41,159
<i>I hear them calling</i>

1419
01:55:41,367 --> 01:55:44,704
<i>I feel them gnawing</i>

1420
01:55:44,871 --> 01:55:50,209
<i>Holes through flawless souls</i>

1421
01:55:53,129 --> 01:55:56,633
OK, everybody, the water temperature is 63°.

1422
01:55:56,841 --> 01:55:59,928
Pop's thumb should be OK
if we find it within the next six hours.

1423
01:56:00,094 --> 01:56:02,263
- Sure?
- Do the math, motherfucker.

1424
01:56:02,472 --> 01:56:04,766
- Damn!
- Jeez.

1425
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:16,152
- Fellas, I think I found it!
- What?

1426
01:56:22,951 --> 01:56:25,536
- False alarm.
- Oh, damn, Whitey!
