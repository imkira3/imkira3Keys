I need you to cooperate

This is non-negotiable.
Do you understand?

Now, I'm sure you're surprised to learn
that I can communicate with you.

It was the end of October?

136
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:14,920
We were putting up
Halloween decorations.

137
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:16,225
You're certain?

138
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:20,661
You're sure about that?

139
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:22,797
Yeah.

140
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:31,272
Get me the
Minnesota file.

141
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:34,408
Bring up all that data
we have on Minnesota.

142
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:36,774
And tell Morgan to keep
pushing him on that.

143
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:38,676
- On it.
- What are his vitals?

144
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:39,981
Let me check.

145
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:43,182
Okay, and who bit you?

146
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:50,688
Geographically possible.
Look, November, December.

147
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,923
It's not even close.

148
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:53,860
This is one of the earliest
we've spoken to.

149
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:58,163
Come on, Morgan,
give me what I need.

150
00:07:58,165 --> 00:07:59,797
Tell me
about the attack today?

151
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,767
We couldn't believe our luck
when your soldiers showed up.

152

The feeling
I felt in my gut...

153
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,771
- You mean the burn?
- What?

154
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:09,040
You mean the burn,
the burn to commit violence,

155
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:11,276
to be violent,
to tear someone's head off.

156
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:14,345
To rip someone's teeth out.
You're talking about the burn?

157
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:17,282
Yeah, I know
about the burn, Joe.

158
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:19,051
We're not that different,
me and you.

159
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,086
Like lust.

160
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:25,289
I understand you, buddy.

161
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,792
And I wanna help you.

162
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:31,030
Joe.

163
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:34,364
So how many of you
were traveling today?

164
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:37,267
- 200, 250.
- 250? That's a lot.

165
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:39,203
We ripped your
soldiers apart.

166
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:41,138
And if it weren't
for these chains...

167
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,741
Hey, hey, hey, have you ever
heard of Daniel Burnham?

168
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:47,211
So, Daniel Burnham
was an architect.

169
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:48,978
This brilliant architect.
Okay?

170
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,847
He designed all these famous
buildings across the United States

171
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:54,451
including, actually the first
skyscraper in Chicago

172
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:57,387
and that amazing building
in New York City,

173
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:03,025
the Flatiron. Anyway, his
real passion was wine.

174
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:05,962
Danny Burnham shipped his
around the world, twice,

175
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:09,899
on these slow freighters.
So, sometimes the wine

176
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:14,203
would take years, and years,
and years to come back to him.

177
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:17,206
Anyway, one day,
me and my wife,

178
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,076
we're in this really beautiful building
that Burnham designed in like,

179
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:22,877
nineteen hundred
and something.

180
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,782
And we come across five old,
beautiful, dusty cases

181
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:30,285
of Daniel Burnham's wine.
The point is,

182
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:34,422
whenever Daniel Burnham opened a bottle
of his wine amongst his buddies,

183
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:36,458
he would read them the long
list of all the countries

184
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,860
that each specific bottle
had traveled,

185
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:42,464
so whenever they drank it
they knew it wasn't just a sip

186
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:45,367
of beautiful wine,

187
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:47,837
this was a trip around
the motherfucking world.

188
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:55,909
This wine is my only
connection to the past, Joe.

189
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:57,880
To the world as it was.

190
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:01,316
Remember that.

191
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:05,288
You know, Joe, I've forgotten
what fresh air feels like.

192
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:09,957
And sunlight.
I hate this place.

193
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,525
I hate seeing you people
in pain.

194
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,227
I hate not being able
to help you,

195
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:17,965
but I wanna understand you,
Joe. I do.

196
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,933
<b></b> <i>Looks like we're
making real progress in there.</i>

197
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:21,435
Shit.

198
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:23,404
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

199
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,539
Don't make me. Come on, man.
Take it easy.

200
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,040
I wanna help you.

201
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,011
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me!

202
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:33,815
What is wrong with you?

203
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,518
I'm trying to make progress in there.
What is it with this dude?

204
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,452
- Are you all right?
- No. Yeah. I'm fine.

205
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:42,288
- What's he keep saying in there?
- For me to go fuck myself.

206
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,090
<b></b> Tell him we'd
all do that if we could.

207
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:45,892
Why are you coddling
that son of a bitch?

208
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:47,560
Please, Colonel.

209
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:49,197
When was
the last Halloween?

210
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:51,964
Last October.

211
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,433
No, that we celebrated.

212
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:56,071
Oh. Um, a year
and a half ago.

213
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,274
My Tommy was Spiderman.

214
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,242
- I want some answers.
- Back off, Colonel.

215
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:05,580
- What is the problem?
- Colonel, there is no problem.

216
00:11:05,814 --> 00:11:07,480
I just need the subject to calm down.
That's all.

217
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:09,515
Bullshit.
Get him back inside

218
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:12,150
and show that monster who's
in charge, or I will.

219
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:14,421
- That's enough, Colonel.
- This guy, man.

220
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:18,990
You're damn right it is.

221
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:22,127
- What's he doing?
- Colonel!

222
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:23,295
- Hey! Hey!
- What?

223
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:30,202
Now, he looks pretty
damn calm to me.

224
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:31,403
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

225
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:32,970
Are you out
of your goddamn mind?

226
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:35,307
- He was wasting our time.
- He was from Minnesota.

227
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:36,907
He was infected
Halloween night,

228
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,577
that predates any previous
record of infection.

229
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,546
He might, he just might, have
been a link to Patient Zero.

230
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:43,615
<b><font face="Rockwell" color="#D900D9">Get your hands off me.

231
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:45,385
You're gonna shoot me,
Colonel?

232
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:51,090
There are a million more
just like him.

233
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:53,257
What the...

234
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,459
Put the fucking wine away.
Clean up this shit.

235
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,328
- You're an asshole.
- Let's bring in the next one.

236
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,331
You were born an asshole, and you
will fucking die an asshole.

237
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:05,603
I hate this
fucking place!

238
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,538
You overstep your
authority like that again

239
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,273
and I'll have you stripped
of your command.

240
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:12,175
- My orders...
- Your orders are to protect

241
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:15,412
my laboratory. What we do
here is scientific research,

242
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:18,649
not executions. You shot
him to get even with me.

243
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:20,583
Don't even think
about denying it.

244
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:23,086
You're upset that I put you down
and spoke to you like a child.

245
00:12:23,088 --> 00:12:25,555
But I have no choice when you
continue to act like a child.

246
00:12:25,557 --> 00:12:27,424
I get that
you're frustrated,

247
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:30,260
that you're posted to a scientific
operation and not a military one.

248
00:12:30,262 --> 00:12:34,063
I understand, but you do
something like that again

249
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:36,633
and I promise you will rue
the day that we ever met,

250
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:39,170
if you don't already.
Are we clear, Colonel?

251
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:49,313
I'll take that as a yes.

252
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:58,587
He was traveling in a much
larger pack than normal today.

253
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:00,289
250, he said,
you know.

254
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,090
A wolf-pack stays big
enough to hunt as a team,

255
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:03,692
but small enough
to feed everybody.

256
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:06,662
And 250 is not a pack,
it's a goddamn army.

257
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:08,664
I'd like you to calm down.
Take a couple of these.

258
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,633
No! No! I cannot
take any more pills.

259
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:13,502
It's driving
me insane.

260
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:16,638
I keep having these nightmares.
These vivid flashbacks.

261
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,442
Stay still,
I'm gonna take your pulse.

262
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,611
Yes, flashbacks,
okay. Go on.

263
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:27,081
I can hear her scream, but
I can't, I just... <b></b>

264
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,616
I can't reach her,
you know.

265
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:31,554
- Stop torturing yourself.
- That's all I do. Torture myself.

266
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,324
Stop.

267
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:39,660
You know Janet and I
had this thing.

268
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:41,529
We never liked saying
goodbye to each other

269
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,233
because it sounds
so permanent.

270
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:46,667
So instead of
saying goodbye,

271
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:49,772
we would pick a random
topic from the alphabet.

272
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:53,440
And we would recycle
through all 26 letters

273
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:56,011
over and over again, but we
would never say the words,

274
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:59,114
- "Goodbye."
- That's cute.

275
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:00,750
Yeah.

276
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:04,119
Yeah, that's cute.

277
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,024
Don't you miss that?
Don't you miss being cute?

278
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:14,296
Being human?
Hell, yeah.

279
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,233
You're fine.

280
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:33,707
Hope you're being safe.

281
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:35,740
Excuse me.

282
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:38,575
Is it advisable to consort with
someone who's been bitten,

283
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:40,644
from a scientific
perspective?

284
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:42,512
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

285
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:45,248
Or maybe this is some
perverse line of research.

286
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,720
I don't know.
You tell me.

287
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:51,657
- Oh, my God. That's it.
- What?

288
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:57,896
You're upset that I care
for Morgan, aren't you?

289
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:03,499
- Excuse me?
- Colonel, I wouldn't have chosen you

290
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,403
if you were the last man
on Earth.

291
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:09,205
You know the first
thing they teach

292
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:10,506
a ranger about
counter-insurgence?

293
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:12,878
Oh, please enlighten me.

294
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:15,578
When confronted with a group
of suspected terrorists,

295
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,149
and one in that group is a
woman, you take her out first.

296
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:22,420
You know why?

297
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:26,355
Because you never
can trust a bitch.

298
00:16:26,357 --> 00:16:28,191
Is that a threat,
Colonel?

299
00:16:29,794 --> 00:16:31,261
Just sharing.

300
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:36,934
- You know why I think that is?
- No. Let's hear it.

301
00:16:39,469 --> 00:16:42,704
Because women always have to
work harder to prove themselves.

302
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:44,807
Consequently, they
invariably become smarter

303
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:47,308
and more dangerous than
their male counterparts.

304
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,180
- Is that a threat, Doctor?
- Just sharing.

305
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:39,459
Hey.

306
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:40,896
Don't do that.

307
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,668
Look, we need to see
if it's working.

308
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:49,237
Please.

Please.

some horny, sick fuck,

wolf or coyote's pussy.

You're a sick fucker, Scooter.
I like it.

You tell that to the guy who contracted
HIV by fucking that rhesus monkey.

317

That was never proven.

Because what
self-respecting monkey

Place of birth? Fine.

Let's play it that way.

Oh, how does that feel?
Yeah, you like that?

You like that?
You like The Who? Boom!

You know, music has an
interesting effect on you guys.

436
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:52,589
Your auditory system has been changed.
You can't process harmony.

No harmony anymore.
I mean, music.

have left and you even screw that up.

00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,612
Oh, okay. That feel good?
That feel nice?

00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:19,582
Yeah? Place of birth?

The first Infected.

454

- You mean the original?
- The original, yeah.

455
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:47,440
Do you know where he is?
You know where he is.

456

You wanna listen
to some more music?

457

Go ahead.
Play your fucking music.

00:29:26,045 --> 00:29:27,245
You took my friend.

466
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:28,649
My best friend in here.

467
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:31,617
The only person who made me laugh
in this godforsaken world.

468
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:35,019
Okay? You killed him.
You took him away from me.

469
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:36,187
- <i>Morgan!</i>
- Where is Patient Zero?

470
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:37,655
I can keep asking all day.

471
00:29:37,657 --> 00:29:39,692
Where is he? Where is he?

472
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:41,428
Do it.

473
00:29:43,898 --> 00:29:45,031
Do it.

474
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:47,700
Do it. Do it.

475
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:49,669
Do it.

476
00:29:52,238 --> 00:29:56,340
<i>Both subjects were turned a
year and a half ago in Minnesota.</i>

477
00:29:56,342 --> 00:29:58,308
Which crucially leads us
to believe...

478
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,312
So might one of them
be this Patient Zero?

479
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:06,216
Uh, no, sir, both were
turned by another Infected,

480
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:10,454
but Patient Zero could be a part
of this early Minnesota pack.

481
00:30:10,456 --> 00:30:13,156
What we need to do
is expand our search

482
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:15,425
around the area where we
found both patients today.

483
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:18,395
Why should we believe anything
one of them tells us?

484
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:20,197
Because they
don't lie, sir.

485
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:22,399
Are you saying that they have
some sort of moral compass?

486
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:25,737
No, sir, our studies tell us that
there is no such thing as deceit

487
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,737
among the Infected.

488
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:31,008
Their responses, though almost
always violent, are always truthful.

489
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:34,043
Why is that?

490
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,412
Well, we're still studying
their neural control center

491
00:30:36,414 --> 00:30:38,247
to determine that, sir,
but I can tell you...

492
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:40,349
We can't risk
any more soldiers

493
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:42,585
on another
low percentage mission.

494
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:44,286
That's what
it all boils down to.

495
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:47,623
We cannot reverse-engineer a
vaccine without Patient Zero.

496
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,124
And there's no plan B,
gentlemen.

497
00:30:49,126 --> 00:30:51,293
No Plan B doesn't mean
we have a good Plan A.

498
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:53,028
I was right about Vegas.

499
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,499
I gave Colonel Knox a report saying
that we're seeing more and more

500
00:30:56,501 --> 00:31:00,034
evolution in the adaptive and
strategic behavior of the Infected.

501
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:03,472
It stated that as long as the
Vegas facility was exposed,

502
00:31:03,474 --> 00:31:04,742
then the Infected were
bound to find a way in.

503
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:06,174
I dealt with it in the way
it was warranted, sir.

504
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:07,408
Colonel Knox chose
to shelve the report.

505
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,644
It was speculation
at best.

506
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:11,513
And it played out exactly
as I predicted.

507
00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:13,716
<b></b> This has nothing to do
with what we're talking about.

508
00:31:13,718 --> 00:31:15,383
This has everything to do with
what we're talking about.

509
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:18,086
I keep trying
to tell you,

510
00:31:18,088 --> 00:31:22,357
the Infected are not just sick
people suffering from a deficit.

511
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:26,594
Something new, smart and
dangerous is evolving, sir.

512
00:31:26,596 --> 00:31:28,763
- They're learning.
- They're learning, exactly.

513
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:32,333
She's right, they're learning.
They're developing new strategies.

514
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:34,536
- They're becoming more aware.
- Traveling in larger packs.

515
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:37,070
Exactly. Like, how much longer
do you think it's gonna be

516
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:39,643
until they realize that we're down here?
It's happening.

517
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:46,348
Sir.

518
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:49,786
You're right.

519
00:31:54,156 --> 00:31:56,089
It sounds like
actionable intel to me.

520
00:31:56,091 --> 00:31:59,192
- Oh, no. Respectfully, sir...
- She was right about Vegas.

521
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:00,427
Thank you, sir.

522
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:02,329
Thousands of people
died in that base,

523
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:05,601
which is not something you should
be proud of being right about.

524
00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:09,201
What's Cheyenne got to say?

525
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:10,771
Comm links with NORAD
and USNORTHCOM

526
00:32:10,773 --> 00:32:12,808
Alternate Command
are still down, sir.

527
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:15,609
Dispatch squads
for thorough sweep.

528
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:18,580
- Sir.
- Time is running out.

529
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:22,317
Anderson.

530
00:32:24,786 --> 00:32:26,254
Pull the trigger.

531
00:32:29,123 --> 00:32:30,391
Good job.

532
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:34,295
That guy
is an asshole.

533
00:33:05,258 --> 00:33:07,594
We could have a baby,
me and you.

534
00:33:12,131 --> 00:33:14,733
Come on, Janet, what? You're not
gonna talk about this ever?

535
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:17,234
Because I know how much
you want your own child.

536
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:19,269
That's not true.
I...

537
00:33:19,271 --> 00:33:21,605
I want a child
with you.

538
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:24,776
You know I love you for saying that.
But you know it is.

539
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:29,179
You know, we agreed we'd wait until
we could afford a surrogate.

540
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:31,682
Baby, there are so many kids
out there that need a home.

541
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:35,586
- What? What are you...
- Eat your pad thai.

542
00:33:43,462 --> 00:33:45,330
I heard gunshots earlier.

543
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:48,834
Oh, no. That's nothing.

544
00:33:51,137 --> 00:33:52,803
It didn't sound
like nothing.

545
00:33:52,805 --> 00:33:54,537
It's business as usual.

546
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,406
Well, I don't know what
"business as usual" means

547
00:33:56,408 --> 00:33:58,241
because you never
tell me anything.

548
00:33:58,243 --> 00:34:00,878
Well, trust me, you don't wanna
know because it's ugly out there.

549
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,512
It's uglier in here.

550
00:34:06,451 --> 00:34:09,218
You know how
in the movies

551
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,821
when there's an alien invasion,
everybody comes together

552
00:34:11,823 --> 00:34:13,856
to defeat a common enemy?

553
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:15,758
It turns out real life
is a little more

554
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,930
complicated than that,
you know.

555
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:24,299
Everybody wants to kill everybody
else for food or shelter.

556
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:26,203
There's more
that's complicated.

557
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:29,841
Is it the doctor?

558
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,509
I can sense it.

559
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,481
She's pretty.

560
00:34:37,948 --> 00:34:40,415
Janet.

561
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:43,454
You know, I took for granted the
simple things that made me human.

562
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:45,887
Like tears.

563
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:48,457
- Hey, you are everything to me.
- Not everything.

564
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:50,759
- Baby, listen to me.
- I'm not your baby!

565
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:53,360
- Hey. Janet.
- I'm one of them!

566
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:56,297
I know you don't wanna hear
this, but when I was out there,

567
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:58,001
I liked it.

568
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:00,634
- The simplicity, the freedom.
- No. No.

569
00:35:00,636 --> 00:35:02,973
- The violence. You have to let me go.
- No.

570
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,842
- Please, stay away from me. Please.
- No.

571
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:11,612
You gotta promise me

572
00:35:11,614 --> 00:35:13,781
that you're not
gonna give up.

573
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:15,750
Because we are
getting somewhere here.

574
00:35:15,752 --> 00:35:17,453
The treatment is working.

575
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:20,421
There's still hope.

576
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:23,593
Don't you give up.
Okay?

577
00:35:25,461 --> 00:35:26,929
And I love you.

578
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:36,939
All right.

579
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:41,276
W is for Waltz.

580
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:45,478
Remember when we took
that ballroom dance class

581
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,382
and fell all over
each other?

582
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:04,764
- I gotta go. Bye.
- No. Don't leave me.

583
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,766
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Where did we leave off?

584
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:10,003
Uh... What, it's R-S-T.
I think it's your turn.

585
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:12,540
- T. T. T. T.
- Yeah, make it count.

586
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:15,340
- You ready?
- Okay.

587
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:18,979
- T is for tears.
- Okay.

588
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:25,519
You make me so happy. I can't
remember the last time I cried.

589
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:27,553
Oh.

590
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:29,657
- It's good. It's good.
- Good. Good.

591
00:36:34,995 --> 00:36:36,462
<b></b> Tears.

592
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:39,967
I miss my tears. I do...

593
00:36:42,635 --> 00:36:45,371
Maybe we should take a day
off the vampire routine.

594
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:49,542
You look like shit.

595
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,678
What? Thank you.

596
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:54,447
I'm fine.

597
00:36:55,815 --> 00:36:57,782
What do the lab
results say?

598
00:36:57,784 --> 00:36:59,951
We still don't know why
your blood is resistant.

599
00:36:59,953 --> 00:37:01,752
But the antibody
drug conjugate

600
00:37:01,754 --> 00:37:04,021
is definitely lowering
Janet's viral load.

601
00:37:04,023 --> 00:37:05,556
Okay.

602
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:08,127
It's slowing down the infection,
even easing the rage.

603
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:10,096
Okay, good.

604
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,632
But, uh, only temporarily. Look.

605
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:23,707
That rat was treated with our
latest vaccine from your blood.

606
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:26,144
It was only
five minutes in.

607
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:28,845
Well, the guy's
behind you, still.

608
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:31,581
Well, he looks like an
asshole, for a rat.

609
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:37,956
What I'm trying
to tell you is,

610
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,590
basically, we're still
far off the vaccine.

611
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,495
A vaccine will prevent
further infection, but...

612
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,931
Morgan, you gotta start
listening to me when I tell you

613
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,135
that there's no guarantee
that I can bring Janet back.

614
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,568
Don't. Not this.

615
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,603
- You're not listening to me.
- Please, don't.

616
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,475
I don't need it, okay. Not today.
Give me a break.

617
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,711
Okay?

618
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,852
- I feel how you touch me.
- Gina...

619
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,689
I can see
how you look at me.

620
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:18,093
I love you, Morgan.

621
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,932
I love that you still love her.
I do.

622
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,898
But it's time for you
to let go.

623
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,801
Whoa, whoa. Don't tell me what
it's time for me to do, okay?

624
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:28,870
That is not your place.
Just back the fuck up

625
00:38:28,872 --> 00:38:31,174
for one minute here.
God damn it.

626
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:36,846
Oh, yeah, and by the way,
she's not dead. Okay?

627
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:42,585
No, she's worse.

628
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:19,186
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

629
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:21,587
- For what?
- For what, the shop.

630
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:24,757
The record store was meant
to be our adventure.

631
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:27,560
- Hey. Shh. It's okay.
- It's not okay.

632
00:39:27,562 --> 00:39:30,063
What, we gotta sell our wedding rings
to keep the goddamn lights on?

633
00:39:30,065 --> 00:39:31,200
I mean, come on.

634
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:40,973
- Maybe I should go back to teaching.
- No!

635
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:45,279
You hated teaching. The shop
is your dream. Our dream.

636
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:48,180
You know, and I won't give it up
even if I have to work 10 jobs.

637
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,637
Janet! Janet!

638
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,174
<b></b> Morgan!

639
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:44,703
Tartakoff. Staff Sergeant.

640
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:53,813
Downey. Captain.

641
00:40:54,947 --> 00:40:56,348
His name was Hank Downey.

642
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:01,820
He was one of mine.

643
00:41:27,745 --> 00:41:29,178
No! No!

644
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:54,771
Get out of the way.

645
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:13,257
- What's going on?
- Alarm in the crematorium.

646
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:03,705
Release him, sir.
I got a shot.

647
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:09,442
Wait, wait, wait. Take it easy.
Don't kill him.

648
00:43:10,946 --> 00:43:12,445
Give me one good
fucking reason not to.

649
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:16,082
Take it easy, Knox. Okay?

650
00:43:16,084 --> 00:43:18,784
He says he wants to talk to
the one who can understand.

651
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:41,942
Wrist secure.

652
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:46,313
Securing waist.

653
00:43:47,847 --> 00:43:49,183
Check secondary cuff.

654
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,787
Secondary...

655
00:43:57,223 --> 00:43:59,025
Waist secure.

656
00:44:01,394 --> 00:44:03,129
Shackle secure.

657
00:44:05,031 --> 00:44:08,966
Three, two, one, release.

658
00:44:08,968 --> 00:44:10,303
Releasing.

659
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:16,976
Move out.

660
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:18,910
Slowly.

661
00:44:47,773 --> 00:44:49,074
Hey.

662
00:44:54,845 --> 00:44:56,080
Hello.

663
00:45:06,357 --> 00:45:08,324
The music's not
affecting him at all.

664
00:45:08,326 --> 00:45:09,594
Nothing.

665
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:12,363
Not a bit.

666
00:45:22,573 --> 00:45:24,208
- He's smoking.
- He's smoking.

667
00:45:36,252 --> 00:45:39,590
He had a University of
Minneapolis campus ID on him.

668
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:43,124
Professor Michael Jansen.

669
00:45:43,126 --> 00:45:44,961
- What kind of professor?
- Doesn't say.

670
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:01,244
- Um... Be careful.
- I will.

671
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:04,113
You know,
I love this song.

672
00:46:13,523 --> 00:46:15,322
You wanted to speak with me?

673
00:46:15,324 --> 00:46:18,024
I wanted to see if the
rumors were true.

674
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:20,093
The rumors. Oh, well.

675
00:46:20,095 --> 00:46:23,632
I didn't realize I was so popular.
How do you know about me?

676
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:27,669
Well, you know us Infected.
We just love to gossip.

677
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:29,636
So you were a professor?

678
00:46:29,638 --> 00:46:31,371
By passion and trade.

679
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:33,340
Do you remember anything
about your human life?

680
00:46:33,342 --> 00:46:34,441
Do you remember teaching?

681
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:37,109
Of course. Don't you?

682
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:39,211
Well, I mean, how do
you know I was a...

683
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,483
Mmm. Like I said, word travels.
What subject?

684
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,621
- Biology. I gave it up.
- Yes.

685
00:46:47,623 --> 00:46:51,223
I would have to if I had to teach a
bunch of high school Neanderthals.

686
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,361
Hey, don't hate on the kids.</font></b>

687
00:46:54,462 --> 00:46:57,963
No, no, no.
Thank you. I quit.

688
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:01,167
Good for you. I, however,
am a lifetime smoker.

689
00:47:01,169 --> 00:47:03,371
Oh! That'll get you
in the end, you know.

690
00:47:05,206 --> 00:47:07,408
Okay, so when
were you infected?

691
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:12,480
Oh, here we go.
When were you infected?

692
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:15,683
When were you infected?

693
00:47:19,186 --> 00:47:23,154
When were you infected? No?
You don't wanna play?

694
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:25,358
This is how you wanna play? You wanna
play nice? You wanna play rough?

695
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,226
No, look, I got all day,
all night.

696
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:30,462
Funnily enough, I got nowhere
that I need to be tonight,

697
00:47:30,464 --> 00:47:32,230
so it's only a matter of time.

698
00:47:32,232 --> 00:47:36,303
Trust me, young man, time's a
luxury that you cannot afford.

699
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:45,042
- So, the music doesn't bother you?
- No.

700
00:47:45,044 --> 00:47:46,411
Is it supposed to?

701
00:47:46,413 --> 00:47:48,245
Well, it has with every
other Infected, yeah.

702
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:52,182
So because of the behavior of a
few, you assume we're all the same?

703
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:54,084
Just an observation.
Broad observation.

704
00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:56,520
It doesn't take
individuality into account.

705
00:47:56,522 --> 00:47:58,655
Oh, excuse me.
So each Infected is different?

706
00:47:58,657 --> 00:48:00,424
Yes, well,
why wouldn't we be?

707
00:48:00,426 --> 00:48:02,693
Each uninfected is different.

708
00:48:02,695 --> 00:48:05,496
Look at you.
You were bitten.

709
00:48:05,498 --> 00:48:07,331
The virus altered
you enough so that

710
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,500
you could communicate
with us and yet,

711
00:48:09,502 --> 00:48:11,770
you're still not really
one of us.

712
00:48:13,272 --> 00:48:14,540
Are you?

713
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:17,543
No, I'm not one of you.

714
00:48:21,112 --> 00:48:22,546
Anyway, back to business.

715
00:48:22,548 --> 00:48:24,347
You wanna tell me
about Patient Zero?

716
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:25,751
Why would I answer
your questions?

717
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:28,251
And even if I did, why would
I answer them honestly?

718
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:31,220
Because I'm asking so nicely,
and I know that you can't lie.

719
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:34,156
- Oh, is that so?
- I believe it to be so.

720
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:36,292
I mean, at least that is my
understanding of your nature.

721
00:48:36,294 --> 00:48:38,429
Oh, that is your
understanding of my nature?

722
00:48:39,564 --> 00:48:41,097
That's quite precious.

723
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,098
Believe me, I've seen a
lot of you come and go.

724
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,301
A lot, but not all.

725
00:48:45,303 --> 00:48:47,270
Well, so you're the anomaly.

726
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:50,373
Well, I do like to think
of myself as special.

727
00:48:54,444 --> 00:48:56,246
Don't you believe
in exceptions?

728
00:48:57,314 --> 00:49:00,215
I do believe in exceptions.

729
00:49:00,217 --> 00:49:02,052
- Go ahead. Please explain.
- I...

730
00:49:05,756 --> 00:49:07,591
This should be quite good.

731
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,726
Free will, Professor.

732
00:49:11,728 --> 00:49:14,429
I believe you lost that
capacity when you were turned.

733
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:16,498
Oh, I see.

734
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,200
So, you're postulating that because I'm no
longer human, that I don't have free will.

735
00:49:20,202 --> 00:49:23,572
And yet, here I am conversing
with you, enjoying a smoke.

736
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:25,742
These are hardly the traits
one would associate with

737
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,743
an animal.

738
00:49:28,745 --> 00:49:33,213
In fact, I would argue that we're
a more evolved species than you.

739
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:36,283
An evolved species that destroys
without any conscience.

740
00:49:36,285 --> 00:49:39,720
Yes, just like humans, who destroy
chickens and cows without a conscience.

741
00:49:39,722 --> 00:49:42,256
No, no, come on, man, that's
food, that's sustenance.

742
00:49:42,258 --> 00:49:44,560
What do you think violence
is for us?

743
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,668
You wanna tell me
how you became infected?

744
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:06,747
I was teaching a class
the day it happened.

745
00:50:06,749 --> 00:50:09,582
I had just started a lecture
on medieval philosophy.

746
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:14,654
St. Augustine says that man must
love because he is incomplete.

747
00:50:14,656 --> 00:50:17,323
Loving is
an act of good.

748
00:50:17,325 --> 00:50:22,261
A unique human ability, granted
as a gift from a higher power.

749
00:50:22,263 --> 00:50:26,133
In St. Augustine's
<i>Doctrine of Love,</i>

750
00:50:29,303 --> 00:50:32,473
he states that... Um...</font></b>

751
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:40,813
"To not love
is to be incomplete,

752
00:50:40,815 --> 00:50:46,587
"to not love is to not
be human." Excuse me.

753
00:50:49,223 --> 00:50:51,757
Hello. Hello.

754
00:50:51,759 --> 00:50:54,493
Yeah. Hi, honey, look, I can't
talk right now, all right?

755
00:50:54,495 --> 00:50:56,227
- I'm busy...
<i>- People are being attacked.</i>

756
00:50:56,229 --> 00:50:57,729
- What?
- <i>You gotta come home.</i>

757
00:50:57,731 --> 00:51:00,565
- <i>I'm really scared.</i>
- Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.

758
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:02,801
- <i>I hear screams.</i>
- What's happening?

759
00:51:04,605 --> 00:51:06,570
Wait, honey, look, I'll call you back.
I'll call you right back.

760
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:21,485
Help me. Help me, please.</font></b>

761
00:51:21,487 --> 00:51:23,654
- Hurry, come on.
- I'm coming.

762
00:51:23,656 --> 00:51:26,357
Oh, my God, what's going on?

763
00:51:50,348 --> 00:51:52,250
<i>What happened to your family?</i>

764
00:51:53,518 --> 00:51:56,221
- <i>What?</i>
<i>- Your family?</i>

765
00:52:01,393 --> 00:52:03,960
- My family?
- Yeah.

766
00:52:03,962 --> 00:52:05,497
You know what happened
to them?

767
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:11,435
When the virus takes over
your body,

768
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,006
it's like...

769
00:52:17,641 --> 00:52:19,976
Every nerve
has been stretched...

770
00:52:19,978 --> 00:52:21,612
<i>Help!</i> <b></b>

771
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,715
Sliced with broken glass,

772
00:52:26,717 --> 00:52:28,552
and doused in vinegar.

773
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:34,890
But even in the throes
of this pain,

774
00:52:34,892 --> 00:52:37,428
I was driven
by one compelling thought.

775
00:52:41,431 --> 00:52:43,366
I needed to see my family.

776
00:52:45,568 --> 00:52:47,602
<i>Please leave
your message after the tone.</i>

777
00:52:48,705 --> 00:52:50,538
Honey, it's me.

778
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,475
Look, I saw the news. Please call
me back as soon as you can, okay?

779
00:52:53,343 --> 00:52:54,911
I love you.

780
00:53:05,588 --> 00:53:07,357
Oh, thank God.
You're safe.

781
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:11,993
Honey, you're safe.</font></b>

782
00:53:11,995 --> 00:53:14,697
I tried calling my mother but
all the circuits are busy...

783
00:53:18,835 --> 00:53:20,302
Honey...

784
00:53:22,272 --> 00:53:23,572
What's the matter?

785
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,516
<i>I tore my wife's
limbs from her torso</i>

786
00:53:36,518 --> 00:53:38,453
<i>like wings from a butterfly.</i>

787
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:42,689
<i>She begged me to stop.</i>

788
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:44,526
<i>And cried out my name.</i>

789
00:53:45,494 --> 00:53:47,996
<i>But I couldn't until</i>

790
00:53:48,831 --> 00:53:50,598
<i>I ripped out her heart.</i>

791
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:53,902
Daddy?

792
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:08,049
I wanted to tell her that
I was no longer her daddy.

793
00:54:13,321 --> 00:54:15,456
You're a goddamn animal.

794
00:54:19,526 --> 00:54:21,126
Between the humans
and The Infected,

795
00:54:21,128 --> 00:54:23,863
who do you think is on the top
of the evolutionary scale?

796
00:54:23,865 --> 00:54:26,433
- Not you.
- See, I beg to differ.

797
00:54:28,002 --> 00:54:30,702
Our brains have been enhanced
by the virus.

798
00:54:30,704 --> 00:54:35,609
Therefore freeing us from the
limitations of what you call human.

799
00:54:53,994 --> 00:54:56,995
- Where is Patient Zero?
- Oh, there is none.

800
00:54:56,997 --> 00:54:58,932
The virus started somewhere,
where is he?

801
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:01,531
The rage.

802
00:55:01,533 --> 00:55:06,536
The rage started here
against the government.

803
00:55:06,538 --> 00:55:10,774
The rich, the poor, foreigners,
intellectuals, conservatives,

804
00:55:10,776 --> 00:55:13,646
feminists, freaks, name it.

805
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,513
- That's where it came from.
- Shut up.

806
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:20,984
We became so angry for so many
good reasons, and for none.

807
00:55:20,986 --> 00:55:24,054
The virus has laid dormant in
us since the beginning of time.

808
00:55:24,056 --> 00:55:26,156
- Shut up.
- And the extremes of modern stress

809
00:55:26,158 --> 00:55:27,858
- have caused it to awaken.
- Shut up.

810
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,693
- We're all, in essence, Patient Zero.
- Shut up. Shut up.

811
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:33,032
Shut up, goddamn it!

812
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:35,966
See?

813
00:55:35,968 --> 00:55:37,802
We're not that different,
are we?

814
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:54,116
- What on Earth's he saying to you?
- Sorry, he's debating with me.

815
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:56,919
- He's a fucking Infected.
- Yeah, I know.

816
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:59,155
Do you need a minute?

817
00:55:59,157 --> 00:56:03,558
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm sorry, the...

818
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,760
- I shouldn't have hit him.
- No, you shouldn't have hit him.

819
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,529
- He's being an asshole.
- Don't hit him again.

820
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,764
- I won't.
- Don't let him get to you.

821
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,069
Go in there
and take control.

822
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,542
Actually, I will bum
that smoke.

823
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,111
Thank you.</font></b>

824
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,618
How long
have you been married?

825
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,156
Is that a question?

826
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:36,925
It's nice to be in
love though, isn't it?

827
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,625
What, you gonna lecture me
about love now?

828
00:56:38,627 --> 00:56:39,729
What do you know
about love?

829
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:42,197
Just because
I killed my family,

830
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:43,699
doesn't mean
I didn't love them.

831
00:56:51,907 --> 00:56:53,275
Thanks.

832
00:56:56,979 --> 00:56:58,247
How's your wife?

833
00:56:59,915 --> 00:57:00,981
Fine.

834
00:57:00,983 --> 00:57:02,084
Is she?

835
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,688
No, she's not.
Thank you for asking.

836
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:12,594
I don't know if my wife's
a human being anymore.

837
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:15,797
That's how she is.

838
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:20,900
I remember why I quit.

839
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:27,707
So that's why you're so interested
in finding Patient Zero.

840
00:57:27,709 --> 00:57:29,175
No, it's because
you're a disease.

841
00:57:29,177 --> 00:57:31,210
A disease that I believe
can be cured.

842
00:57:31,212 --> 00:57:33,780
- Do I look sick to you?
- Yes.

843
00:57:33,782 --> 00:57:37,318
<b></b> I don't think
that we're the disease.

844
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:42,221
I think that human beings are the
disease, and we're the cure.

845
00:57:42,223 --> 00:57:45,060
The antidote that has
been given to Earth

846
00:57:46,894 --> 00:57:48,862
to get rid
of the human infection.

847
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:53,999
How are those headaches
treating you?

848
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:57,035
Oh, fine and dandy,
thank you.

849
00:57:57,037 --> 00:57:59,273
I know more about you
than you know about yourself.

850
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:08,612
Those headaches, that's the rage
inside you, yearning to escape.

851
00:58:08,614 --> 00:58:10,984
Thank you
for the educational talk.

852
00:58:12,752 --> 00:58:15,287
But we are at war here.

853
00:58:15,289 --> 00:58:20,360
If we're at war, I suggest you
ask yourself who's winning.

854
00:58:20,593 --> 00:58:22,362
Oh, you think you're winning?
Hey, let me tell you.

855
00:58:22,595 --> 00:58:25,996
However slight the human race may
be, we will continue to fight.

856
00:58:25,998 --> 00:58:27,998
We will continue
to remain curious.

857
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,168
We will continue to find solutions
and we will continue to adapt

858
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,770
because that is
what we do,

859
00:58:32,772 --> 00:58:35,106
and that is what we have done
since the dawn of time, okay?

860
00:58:35,108 --> 00:58:37,908
What, you see me rub my head,
you see me pop some pills,

861
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:40,711
and from that you figure out
I got chronic headaches?

862
00:58:40,713 --> 00:58:45,082
Geez, Columbo, like you
noticed the tan line

863
00:58:45,084 --> 00:58:47,218
around my ring finger
and from that you

864
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,353
figure out that I was
married, so what?

865
00:58:49,355 --> 00:58:51,255
<b><font face="Rockwell" color="#D900D9">You've been playing me.

866
00:58:51,257 --> 00:58:53,057
You've been playing
tricks on me.

867
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:55,658
Playing tricks like the way you
Trojan horsed yourself in here.

868
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,229
You know, you claim that you
wanted to talk to me,

869
00:58:58,231 --> 00:58:59,662
and that's what
we've been doing,

870
00:58:59,664 --> 00:59:01,698
we've been talking,
and talking,

871
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,301
and talking. We've been going around,
and around, and around in circles

872
00:59:05,303 --> 00:59:07,670
not talking about
anything specific.

873
00:59:07,672 --> 00:59:09,875
No, no, no.
It's just random bullshit.

874
00:59:11,776 --> 00:59:13,644
You're wasting
my goddamn time.

875
00:59:16,982 --> 00:59:19,182
Time.

876
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:21,353
Time which you claim
that I don't have.

877
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:33,265
Gina, can you bring me your
frequency detector, like, now?

878
00:59:41,138 --> 00:59:42,840
What's going on?

879
00:59:44,074 --> 00:59:46,143
You think
he's transmitting a signal?

880
00:59:49,013 --> 00:59:50,713
I don't know.

881
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,289
Morgan?

882
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:06,430
Hey!

883
01:00:15,972 --> 01:00:17,675
You knew about me,
didn't you?

884
01:00:18,341 --> 01:00:19,842
Just like the professor.

885
01:00:20,843 --> 01:00:22,877
This whole goddamn thing
was a setup.

886
01:00:22,879 --> 01:00:25,949
Jesus Christ. You wanted it,
you wanted to be captured.

887
01:00:27,816 --> 01:00:30,986
Yeah, I know, and now I'm gonna
make you talk, motherfucker.

888
01:00:32,188 --> 01:00:34,089
Security, open 23.

889
01:00:38,894 --> 01:00:43,466
Hey, hey, security.
Open gate 23. Security.

890
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,932
Go!</font></b>

891
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,170
- Let's go.
- Open the gate.

892
01:00:49,738 --> 01:00:51,871
- You sure?
- Watch our six.

893
01:00:56,744 --> 01:00:59,446
Knife. Knife.
I need a knife.

894
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:01,049
Here you go.

895
01:01:29,443 --> 01:01:31,443
It was definitely
sending out a signal.

896
01:01:31,445 --> 01:01:34,446
But who the hell put the tracking
device in this Pete Townshend?

897
01:01:34,448 --> 01:01:38,082
I don't know, sir. A smart, a
strategically advanced Infected.

898
01:01:38,084 --> 01:01:41,520
He said it. The guy I was interviewing.
Professor Asshole.

899
01:01:41,522 --> 01:01:43,221
You know,
they know about me.

900
01:01:43,223 --> 01:01:44,323
They know what
we're trying to do here.

901
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,957
They know that we're trying
to stop them.

902
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:47,459
But they don't know
where we are.

903
01:01:47,461 --> 01:01:50,395
So, they planted a tracking
device in Pete Townshend

904
01:01:50,397 --> 01:01:52,263
and The Infected are now
tracking us.

905
01:01:52,265 --> 01:01:54,032
- They know we're here.
- Jesus.

906
01:01:55,535 --> 01:01:57,502
Knox.

907
01:01:57,504 --> 01:01:59,237
Well, where are they now?

908
01:01:59,239 --> 01:02:01,072
- New body bags coming in from the field.
- Body bags?

909
01:02:01,074 --> 01:02:03,209
Make sure no one gets in
or out of this facility.

910
01:02:22,161 --> 01:02:23,996
- Papa.
- What is it?

911
01:02:29,935 --> 01:02:31,503
- No!
- Stop him!

912
01:02:47,486 --> 01:02:49,053
We've been breached.

913
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:54,459
Move!

914
01:03:06,237 --> 01:03:07,472
Go, right there. Go!

915
01:03:14,212 --> 01:03:16,180
Move it. Move, move. Come on.

916
01:03:23,488 --> 01:03:25,656
- We gotta get topside right now.
- No, no, no.

917
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:27,391
I gotta go get her, okay?

918
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:29,059
Meet me.

919
01:03:46,276 --> 01:03:47,277
Open fire!

920
01:04:23,211 --> 01:04:24,245
Fire!

921
01:04:25,146 --> 01:04:26,147
Keep firing!

922
01:04:39,327 --> 01:04:40,426
Hello?

923
01:05:04,418 --> 01:05:06,621
Gina! Go to your right.

924
01:05:35,314 --> 01:05:36,583
General! Run!

925
01:05:37,383 --> 01:05:39,118
- No!
- Move!

926
01:05:40,453 --> 01:05:42,221
You bastard...
Are you mad?

927
01:05:43,055 --> 01:05:44,223
You coward.

928
01:05:45,758 --> 01:05:48,494
Coward? Are you
fucking kidding me?

929
01:05:49,729 --> 01:05:51,264
I just saved you.

930
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,232
You are unbelievable.

931
01:05:55,234 --> 01:05:58,269
You really have no idea,
do you?

932
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,304
We're all gonna fucking
die down here.

933
01:06:24,796 --> 01:06:28,298
It was him or us.

934
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,402
I am, I'm sorry, Andrew.
You're right.

935
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:36,573
I have to go back down
to the lab.

936
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:38,140
Put the gun down,
you can't save more.

937
01:06:38,142 --> 01:06:39,742
I have to get my research.

938
01:06:39,744 --> 01:06:42,477
- I am not fucking around!
- Stay back, I mean it.

939
01:06:42,479 --> 01:06:43,646
- Put the gun...
- No!

940
01:06:54,425 --> 01:06:58,829
- No. Don't come near me.
- Please. Please.

941
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:00,562
- Stay away from me.
- Listen to me.

942
01:07:00,564 --> 01:07:03,164
- Stay away.
- I'm not leaving without you, okay?

943
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:05,166
- I'm not. Don't.
- Stay back. Please.

944
01:07:05,168 --> 01:07:07,436
- Listen to me. I love you.
- Stay back.

945
01:07:07,438 --> 01:07:09,438
I'm gonna
take your hand.

946
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,372
The treatment
is working.

947
01:07:11,374 --> 01:07:13,542
- Stay back.
- Let me take your hand.

948
01:07:13,544 --> 01:07:15,443
- Please.
- Take it easy.

949
01:07:15,445 --> 01:07:17,646
Don't come near me.
Don't come near me.

950
01:07:17,648 --> 01:07:19,182
I love you.

951
01:07:20,718 --> 01:07:23,184
- Let me take your hand, okay?
- Stay back.

952
01:07:23,186 --> 01:07:24,520
Let me take it.

953
01:07:25,355 --> 01:07:28,489
Okay? I got you.

954
01:07:28,491 --> 01:07:31,726
I got you. You gotta trust me.
Okay?

955
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:34,197
It's okay.
I love you, babe.

956
01:07:35,732 --> 01:07:38,164
- Please.
- We can do this.

957
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,568
- I'm gonna take you with me.
- I can't.

958
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:42,237
I believe in you,
baby.

959
01:07:42,805 --> 01:07:44,839
I believe in you.

960
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:46,341
I love you.

961
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:48,477
Come on.

962
01:07:49,779 --> 01:07:51,346
I know you can do this.

963
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:54,180
I know you can.

964
01:07:54,182 --> 01:07:55,417
And I love you.

965
01:07:55,818 --> 01:07:57,617
I love you.

966
01:08:00,489 --> 01:08:02,357
Take my hand.

967
01:08:03,759 --> 01:08:05,293
Okay.

968
01:08:06,129 --> 01:08:07,329
Come on.

969
01:09:07,487 --> 01:09:08,822
Gina.

970
01:09:09,823 --> 01:09:11,389
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

971
01:09:11,391 --> 01:09:13,725
- Morgan, are you mad?
- Yeah, I might be.

972
01:09:13,727 --> 01:09:15,927
But I'm not leaving without her.
Put the gun down.

973
01:09:15,929 --> 01:09:18,796
- No, absolutely not. No.
- Put the gun down, please.

974
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:21,799
Gina, listen to me.
She could turn at any time.

975
01:09:21,801 --> 01:09:24,468
No, she won't. The injections are working.
You said so yourself.

976
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:26,771
- Put the goddamn gun down.
- But not lasting.

977
01:09:26,773 --> 01:09:31,641
Please, Gina, I'm not
leaving without her.

978
01:09:31,643 --> 01:09:32,979
Please, do this for me.

979
01:09:34,346 --> 01:09:35,647
Please.

980
01:09:38,951 --> 01:09:40,450
Thank you. Gina!

981
01:09:47,259 --> 01:09:48,861
I'm going to the lab
to get my samples.

982
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:51,396
<b></b> Come on.

983
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:27,064
Okay, we gotta move.
The garage, okay?

984
01:10:27,297 --> 01:10:29,033
We go out the same way
that we came in. Let's go.

985
01:10:43,014 --> 01:10:44,948
I think I know another
way we can get up.

986
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:52,680
- Gina, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

987
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:54,816
I'm okay.

988
01:12:00,355 --> 01:12:01,589
Oh, man.

989
01:12:17,471 --> 01:12:18,672
Oh, my God.

990
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:22,409
- What? You know where we are?
- No.

991
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,578
No.

992
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:30,183
- It's a massacre.
- What can you see?

993
01:12:45,933 --> 01:12:48,799
They've seen us.
They're coming.

994
01:12:48,801 --> 01:12:50,037
Oh, goddamn it.

995
01:12:52,538 --> 01:12:53,539
Hurry.

996
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,515
I hate heights.

997
01:13:28,707 --> 01:13:29,841
Oh, no.

998
01:13:39,985 --> 01:13:41,252
Morgan.

999
01:13:43,588 --> 01:13:45,023
No. Morgan!

Oh, shit.

Let's go.

Sorry, Morgan.
I can't let you leave.

1024
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:40,333
Your blood has something in it that
stops you from fully transforming.

1025
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:42,134
Morgan.

1026
01:15:42,136 --> 01:15:44,672
- From reaching complete enlightenment.
- Morgan, what's he saying?

1027
01:15:46,607 --> 01:15:47,975
- Shit.
- What?

1028

- They're here for me.
- What?

1029
01:15:54,348 --> 01:15:56,782
- Ironic, isn't it?
- Morgan, we need to get out of here.

1030
01:15:56,784 --> 01:15:58,951
You're our Patient Zero.

1031
01:15:58,953 --> 01:16:01,355
Which means that you're a
threat to our continued growth.

1032
01:16:02,022 --> 01:16:03,788
To our future.

1033
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:05,957
We need to leave, now.

1034
01:16:05,959 --> 01:16:09,396
And that I cannot allow.

1035
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,164
Run!

1036
01:17:04,183 --> 01:17:06,351
Your blood makes
you weak, Morgan.

1037
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:09,887
You're afraid of pain.

1038
01:17:10,888 --> 01:17:12,457
You're afraid
to go to extremes.

1039
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,025
Embrace enlightenment.

1040
01:17:53,763 --> 01:17:54,898
Quickly.

1041
01:18:02,707 --> 01:18:03,506
Go!

1042
01:18:05,442 --> 01:18:07,275
Go!

1043
01:18:07,277 --> 01:18:09,143
- I can slow them down.
- Don't do this.

1044
01:18:09,145 --> 01:18:11,448
- Okay? You're coming with me.
- No. No.

1045
01:18:12,748 --> 01:18:14,315
Hurry, they're gonna
break through.

1046
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:17,418
- Save the baby.
- What?

1047
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:19,855
Don't you sense it?
She's pregnant.

1048
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:22,490
You're pregnant?

1049
01:18:22,492 --> 01:18:23,959
- I love you.
- Janet, no.

1050
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,463
Janet, please.

1051
01:18:27,763 --> 01:18:28,764
Janet.

1052
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:35,369
No! No! Janet. Please. Please.

1053
01:18:35,371 --> 01:18:37,371
- I love you.
- Janet!

1054
01:18:37,373 --> 01:18:40,173
Hey, Janet, please.
Don't, don't. Janet!

1055
01:18:40,175 --> 01:18:44,810
No, please don't do this.
No, no, no. Janet.

1056
01:18:44,812 --> 01:18:47,182
Janet! Janet!

1057
01:18:48,117 --> 01:18:50,016
I'm sorry.

1058
01:18:50,018 --> 01:18:52,018
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1059
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,289
We gotta go.

1060
01:18:54,523 --> 01:18:56,224
Oh, fuck.

1061
01:18:58,026 --> 01:18:59,193
We gotta move.

1062
01:19:00,128 --> 01:19:01,195
Okay?

1063
01:19:03,398 --> 01:19:05,131
We gotta go.

1064
01:19:05,133 --> 01:19:06,200
Morgan, we gotta go.

1065
01:19:30,924 --> 01:19:32,192
Let's go.

1066
01:19:33,226 --> 01:19:34,361
Come on.

1067
01:19:51,877 --> 01:19:53,511
So I can see it,

1068
01:19:53,513 --> 01:19:55,182
where my bike is stashed.

1069
01:19:58,017 --> 01:19:59,252
Let's go this way.

1070
01:20:12,531 --> 01:20:14,233
Come on, let's go!

1071
01:20:26,212 --> 01:20:27,380
Oh, God.

1072
01:20:29,047 --> 01:20:31,015
We're never gonna make it
this time.

1073
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:35,218
Got you.
Hey, listen to me.

1074
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:38,522
Don't talk like that, okay?
We are gonna make it.

1075
01:20:38,524 --> 01:20:41,391
Me, you, and that baby.
We are gonna be fine.

1076
01:20:41,393 --> 01:20:43,928
We're gonna find somewhere
better, but you gotta trust me.

1077
01:20:45,363 --> 01:20:46,996
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1078
01:20:46,998 --> 01:20:48,166
Okay.
