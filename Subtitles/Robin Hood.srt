2
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,830
Can somebody tell me
what's going on?

3
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,695
Don't be foolish, Walter.
Get him back to bed.

4
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:31,393
- Bar the door.
- I'm still the master of this house.

5
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:32,867
Richard, up.

6
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,039
Who is there?

7
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:38,699
Wake up, Thomas.

8
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:45,905
Open the gates!

9
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,887
Bastards.

10
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:58,887
Arrow.

11
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:04,398
The lantern.

12
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,943
I see you, you little bastards.

13
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:18,878
I see you!

14
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,255
Thieving maggots.

15
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:36,163
They've taken all our seed grain.

16
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,527
What are we going to do for planting?

17
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,462
Pray.

18
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:47,736
Hello, there!

19
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:03,342
- Here you go, lad.
- Thank you, Robin.

20
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,980
Robin.

21
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,887
The archers been called to ranks.

22
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:08,857
Bloody typical.
I'm starving.

23
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,488
Hide these well.

24
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,352
We'll have them for supper instead.

25
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,106
Sire.

26
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,008
Your bath, Sire.

27
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:55,665
For the love of Christ, Loxley,
would you stop them doing that!

28
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,263
They love you, Sire.

29
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,934
My head. It's going like
the bells of hell.

30
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,971
Is that it?

31
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:08,450
One more castle to sack,
then we're home to England.

32
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:11,814
Hail King Richard!

33
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,288
Release!

34
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:19,957
Push!

35
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:22,629
Push!

36
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,199
Hey, archer!

37
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:26,864
Stay alive!

38
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,130
I'll see you tonight.

39
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:30,269
Don't forget your money this time,
little man.

40
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,365
It will be my pleasure
to take it off you.

41
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:35,336
Push!

42
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,278
Move up!

43
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,882
Cover the King!
Cover the King!

44
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:54,889
Barricades prepare!

45
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,732
Let us put these French to bed!

46
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,239
Raise the barricades!

47
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:26,489
Jimmy.

48
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,827
Calm and careful.
Make it count.

49
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,123
Go!

50
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,011
Help!

51
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:56,852
Cover!

52
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:09,729
Now.

53
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,200
Go!

54
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,851
Move back!

55
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:28,018
Blood for France!

56
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:30,850
Go!

57
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,195
It'll make a fine pin cushion!

58
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,289
King Philip's arse!

59
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,108
Look what they do
for the Lion Heart!

60
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:56,243
Look what they do
for the Lion Heart!

61
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:00,247
Push!

62
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,221
Push!

63
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,318
That'll burn all night, lads.
Don't let them put it out.

64
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:08,853
These pricks will smash through
in the morning, take all the credit.

65
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:10,456
Well done, Jimmy boy.

66
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:32,782
John...

67
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,323
Your Majesty.

68
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,984
An English princess shut out
of her husband's bedchamber

69
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:40,222
by a piece of French pastry!

70
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:41,820
Aren't you ashamed?

71
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:43,763
The shame is surely his.

72
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,824
Then go in and tell him.

73
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:49,531
Mewling at his keyhole
is neither one thing nor the other.

74
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,765
John.

75
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,943
Oh, God! What in heaven...

76
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:03,349
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> you will excuse me.
My son has need of my advice.

77
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,216
No, I don't. Ask her.

78
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,052
Mother, please, have you no decency?

79
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:13,687
I happen to be in a condition
that no mother should see her son in.

80
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,401
- Yes, I know, but it's my mother.
- That's enough.

81
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,169
On second thoughts, I think it better
that you do hear what I have to say.

82
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:28,074
Though I will not have you
in my presence.

83
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:29,802
Mother.

84
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,781
The purpose of my being in this room
is to save the realm

85
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,946
from the consequences
of this unsuitable amusement.

86
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:40,717
Her uncle is the bloody King of France.

87
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,859
- My uncle is...
- Get down.

88
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:46,585
Her uncle wants her back.

89
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,363
Philip wants an excuse to cross

90
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,532
the Channel with an army.

91
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:57,198
And you have given him that excuse.

92
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:01,143
Take up your lawful wife
and save England.

93
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,873
My lawful wife
is as barren as a brick.

94
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:07,910
Is that truly the wife
you want for me?

95
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:09,511
Hmm?

96
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,885
You, who honored your husband
with eight children

97
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,516
so that even now
when death has taken the rest

98
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:20,552
you have a king and the runt
of the litter to call you "Mother."

99
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,328
Better the bastard of a servant girl

100
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,959
than bed the niece
of England's jealous enemy.

101
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:28,629
Or bed her and wed her, Mother.

102
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:31,333
I've asked the Pope's men
to arrange an annulment.

103
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,170
And do you think the Pope

104
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:36,837
will favor England's royal runt
over the King of France?

105
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:40,007
He might see his way for the son
of Eleanor of Aquitaine.

106
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,516
And for the future King of England.

107
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:46,385
Richard the Lion Heart
is 40-years-old, if not more.

108
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:49,147
And no babies.

109
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:52,452
I am a queen in the making.

110
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:56,460
Yes. Yes.

111
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,362
You see?

112
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,902
She is my Eleanor.

113
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,543
Now, you do understand,
this game is not about luck.

114
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,547
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

115
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,310
Who'd like to take
a bit of fresh meat home?

116
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:16,477
Caught this morning.
We have a pheasant.

117
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:19,077
Three choices.
Right, left or middle?

118
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,247
Middle.

119
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,757
"The middle," he says.
The middle.

120
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,852
I'm sorry about those onions,
young man. You lose.

121
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,487
Robin! Over here,
they're needed for the pot.

122
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:29,997
Feisty one!

123
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,630
Aye, what else we got,
what else we got?

124
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:35,364
The fire will do its work.

125
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:38,032
We break through at first light.

126
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:41,770
With a fair wind,
we can be home in three days.

127
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,274
You return to Nottingham?

128
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,142
I have a wife who waits for me.

129
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:52,113
I have a mother that won't die

130
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:54,882
and a brother who wishes me dead.

131
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:57,551
First thing I'm going to do
is lock them up.

132
00:12:57,627 --> 00:13:00,323
Your people will rejoice
to see you return home.

133
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:02,990
And that is a condition
I would like to keep them in.

134
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:05,091
To be remembered as I was.

135
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,295
My army knows better.

136
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,364
Lion Heart is mangy.

137
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,106
Every man in that army idolizes you,
Your Majesty.

138
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:19,978
Don't mollycoddle me.

139
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:24,645
I understand how difficult it must be
to befriend a king.

140
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:29,255
Come on, Loxley.
Let us find some ruffians, drink and laugh.

141
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:32,855
Let us see if we can find
an honest man.

142
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:34,055
Yes.

143
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:36,122
Let's do that.

144
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,108
Well, that's the thing, little man.
This is not a game of luck.

145
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:53,546
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

146
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:57,484
I've got a quick eye.
I'll be watching you.

147
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,593
Three choices.

148
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,999
Right, left, or middle.

149
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:17,905
I think I'll take a fourth choice.

150
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,866
- A fourth?
- Hmm.

151
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,037
I've been watching you
for a while now, Longstride.

152
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,445
There is no pea.

153
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,881
This game is a trick!

154
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:34,082
You take out the pea when you're doing
your slidings and your turnings.

155
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:35,488
I got you.

156
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:42,460
Don't touch it again.

157
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,731
I'll do it!

158
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:07,050
You lose.

159
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:27,634
You're doing better than you think.

160
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,473
Get in there, Robin.

161
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:41,652
Kneel, you ignorant bastards!

162
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,589
Kneel before the King!

163
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:47,790
All of you, move back, now.

164
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,960
No, no, Loxley.
These men are soldiers at play.

165
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,229
Sinners after mine own heart.

166
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:57,562
Which one of you started the fight?

167
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,275
I did, Sire.

168
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,704
I threw the first punch.

169
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,145
Ah, honest man.

170
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,413
And who're you fighting?

171
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:12,518
He was fighting me, Your Majesty.

172
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:14,749
I thought him to be a lesser man.

173
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,285
He was showing me different.

174
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:21,327
An enemy that shows his respect.

175
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,229
Stand up, the pair of you.

176
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,528
Not you.

177
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:33,139
Brave and honest.

178
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:39,241
Are you honest enough to tell a king
something that he does not want to hear?

179
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:42,106
What is your opinion on my crusade?

180
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:47,752
Will God be pleased with my sacrifice?

181
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,700
No, he won't.

182
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:02,266
Why do you say that?

183
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,198
The massacre at Acre, Sire.

184
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,470
Speak up!

185
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:13,940
When you had us herd 2,500 Muslim men,
women, and children together,

186
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:18,282
the young woman at my feet,
with her hands bound, she looked up at me.

187
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:22,351
There wasn't fear in her eyes.
There wasn't anger.

188
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,055
There was only pity.

189
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:30,429
For she knew that
when you gave the order

190
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:34,528
and our blades
would descend upon their heads,

191
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:37,734
that, in that moment,
we would be godless.

192
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,872
All of us.

193
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:43,472
Godless.

194
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:49,311
Honest,

195
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:51,711
brave

196
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:54,286
and naïve.

197
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,654
There is your Englishman.

198
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:01,128
Right there.

199
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:05,900
- Well done, Robin.
- You showed him.

200
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,859
The whipping will be
the worst of it.

201
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,335
The branding iron,
that will be the worst.

202
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:10,599
Unless they hang us.

203
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,233
No. No, this will be the worst of it.

204
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:17,643
And this will be the end of it.
As soon as I get out of here, I'm gone.

205
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,943
I don't owe God or any other man here
one more minute of service.

206
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:25,778
We go all the way back
to the same breast.

207
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,312
Wet nurse.

208
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:30,579
Indeed.

209
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:33,514
We've been close ever since.

210
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:36,784
Good.

211
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:42,426
Because England,
under your friend John,

212
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,527
is a country with no fighting spirit.

213
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,966
I can take London
with an army of cooks.

214
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:53,104
But Richard is on his way home.

215
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:57,973
And under Richard,
England is a different animal altogether.

216
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:02,215
Richard will return home
through the Forest of Broceliande.

217
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,253
We know the exact place.

218
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:11,727
He always travels ahead of his army
with only a few trusted knights around him.

219
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:17,226
With Richard dead, it will be easy for you
to turn the country against John.

220
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,364
There'll never be
a better moment to invade.

221
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:27,432
Even dying animals can be obstinate.

222
00:20:30,513 --> 00:20:33,448
Kill the Lion Heart
and you will be richly rewarded.

223
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:53,294
Heave!

224
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,830
Heave!

225
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:13,548
Heave!

226
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:16,149
For England!

227
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:22,295
For England!

228
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,702
I need a physician here!

229
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,744
A physician! Quickly!

230
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:37,506
Give us cover!
Give us cover, now!

231
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,940
Cover him!

232
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,443
Cover the King.

233
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:47,484
Physician!

234
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,082
Why, Loxley?
Are you not feeling well?

235
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,256
Physician!

236
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,759
Wine.

237
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,257
What's this?

238
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,588
- The King is dead!
- Dead?

239
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:29,489
Dead.

240
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:34,529
All right, then, Jimmy. Knock the pegs out.
We make our own fate from now on!

241
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:39,438
I'll come with you.

242
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:42,443
No, you're not.
We don't take strays.

243
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:43,535
The more the merrier.

244
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,546
The road will be dangerous.
He might be useful.

245
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,638
Where we going?

246
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:50,344
To the coast and to a boat
before 3,000 desperate soldiers get there

247
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:52,819
and the price for a Channel crossing
goes up a hundredfold.

248
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:54,253
What about our wages?

249
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:57,383
If you thought it was hard getting wages
while he was alive,

250
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,324
try getting paid by a dead king.

251
00:22:59,395 --> 00:23:02,592
All right, boys,
collect your gear as quick as you can.

252
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,235
I like the new church.

253
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:14,673
Lady Marion.

254
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:20,045
I would have been sorry to leave
without your farewell. Thank you.

255
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:23,550
I'm glad to speed you on your way,
Father Tancred,

256
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:26,986
but it was to seek out
our new shepherd.

257
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:31,516
You have lately been missed
at Sunday worship and my sermons.

258
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:36,264
I like a quiet church, Father,
when I pray for a miracle.

259
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:47,602
Your new flock is women,
children and old folk.

260
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,837
Our men have gone to war
or returned broken.

261
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:53,009
Their orphans run wild
in the greenwood.

262
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:59,851
Our fields are ready for planting
but we've no seed corn.

263
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:03,053
And the church barn
is full of grain.

264
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,753
Surely, you do not expect the church

265
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:08,763
to let its corn be used
to plant your fields?

266
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:11,629
That grain is bound for York.

267
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:14,462
I am Friar Tuck.

268
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,001
Father Tancred is elevated to York

269
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:19,836
where I know he will remind the Bishop
that the people of Nottingham...

270
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:23,708
The Bishop does not need reminding
that the people of Nottingham

271
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:27,840
should reap what they sow
and repent of their sins.

272
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,143
The miracle I pray for is that
the Bishop show some Christian charity.

273
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:39,325
As I said, Father,
I like a quiet church when I pray.

274
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,510
You will have trouble
from the Loxleys of Peper Harow.

275
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:05,685
You keep bees, Tuck?

276
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,949
I keep them and they keep me.

277
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:34,473
Stop!

278
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:37,078
Ambush!

279
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,024
You're a knight?

280
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:58,830
Where is King Richard?

281
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:00,729
Oh, God.

282
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,261
Where is the King?

283
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:04,996
- Dead.
- Dead?

284
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:07,469
Really?

285
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:12,802
If the King's dead,
where are you going?

286
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,441
Deliver the crown.

287
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,911
Richard's crown.

288
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,613
Richard's crown.

289
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:26,586
How do we assassinate a king
who's already dead?

290
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,165
Bring back the crown!
Kill the horse!

291
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,402
You are English.

292
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:46,140
When it suits me.

293
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,108
Who are you?

294
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:52,610
Robert Loxley.

295
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:11,429
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

296
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,343
That's the King's horse.

297
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:22,349
Jimmy! Move!

298
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:33,954
Jimmy!

299
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,533
Robin, they're French.

300
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,804
Ambush.

301
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:09,455
Go.

302
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,461
John.

303
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:50,964
Don't know.

304
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:52,470
He's dead.

305
00:29:52,674 --> 00:29:53,766
Help.

306
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:03,779
My sword.

307
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:16,087
Its value to me is great.

308
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:19,333
It belonged to my father,

309
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:21,762
Sir Walter Loxley

310
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:24,494
of Nottingham.

311
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:27,839
Do you know it?

312
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,673
Aye, I've heard of Nottingham.

313
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:35,783
Then the fate...

314
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:37,978
The fates have smiled on me.

315
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:45,750
You must take the sword to my father.

316
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:48,862
It will bring me peace.

317
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:55,829
I took it in anger
and without his consent.

318
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,400
You must understand the bond of love

319
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:02,670
between a father and his son.

320
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:07,138
My father abandoned me to the world of men
when I was six years old.

321
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,843
I know little of the love
between father and son.

322
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,850
I beg you.

323
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,948
Longstride,

324
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:15,489
say you will.

325
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:21,723
I will.

326
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,611
It's a pact sworn in blood, Robin.

327
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:48,481
It's a scratch, Allan,
and that's all it is.

328
00:32:08,777 --> 00:32:09,937
Robin!

329
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:20,148
Loxley was making for the coast
to meet the ship.

330
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,786
That crown could be our passage home.

331
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:27,718
We're common archers, Robin.

332
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:30,663
If we arrive at the King's ship
with his crown, we'll be accused of murder.

333
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:32,966
How do you know

334
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:37,232
that the knights you see walking about
are actually knights at all?

335
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:39,796
There is no difference between a knight

336
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,935
and any other man
aside from what he wears.

337
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,013
All we need is about us.

338
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,878
Armor, helmets, swords,

339
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,312
and we make England wealthy men

340
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,156
with horses and gold.

341
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,292
Fate has smiled upon us at last.

342
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,996
And I, for one,
shall not turn my back on her.

343
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:11,695
Take that crown off your head, Will,

344
00:33:11,773 --> 00:33:12,865
and fill it to the brim.

345
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:20,311
We commit the soul of this boy
to your keeping, Lord.

346
00:33:20,382 --> 00:33:23,977
We would ask, when he arrives
at the gates of eternity,

347
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:25,610
if you could let him in.

348
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:43,665
Goliath's got the soil turning nicely.
But for what?

349
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:46,968
- Nettles?
- Nettle soup and dandelion salad,

350
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:48,100
that'll keep us alive.

351
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:49,268
Come, Goliath.
This way.

352
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:50,971
Until we get a miracle.

353
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:53,008
This way.

354
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:01,749
Marion, Sheriff.

355
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:13,234
Marion, I've been at Peper Harow,
waiting in vain

356
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,763
for Sir Walter to receive me.

357
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,699
Kindly tell him I have better things to do
than haunt his threshold.

358
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:23,471
That you have, while robbers
are roaming free in Sherwood.

359
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:25,809
That's sheriff's business.
Why don't you look to it?

360
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,110
Tell the old fool that next time,
I'll break his door down.

361
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,911
- And if he's too proud to pay...
- No, no, no, no. He's not too proud.

362
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,511
He's too poor.

363
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:35,954
In the name of King Richard,
you have stripped our wealth

364
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:37,423
to pay for foreign adventures.

365
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:40,227
Whilst at home, the Church,
in the name of the merciful God,

366
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:44,732
has reaped, without mercy, the largest share
of what we had set aside to feed ourselves.

367
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:48,328
Between a sheriff and a bishop,
I wouldn't care to judge

368
00:34:48,403 --> 00:34:50,633
who's the greater curse
on honest English folk.

369
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:54,007
Marion,

370
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:57,101
why, oh, why do you make
an enemy of me

371
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,339
when you have the means
to make me your protector?

372
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:01,113
What means?

373
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:07,687
If you leave now,

374
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,290
I will lengthen your life
by not telling my husband

375
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,918
of your visit when he returns home.

376
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:15,895
Your husband?
After 10 years?

377
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,465
If he's not dead, he's rutting his way
through the brothels of the Barbary Coast.

378
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,000
So speaks a man of experience.

379
00:35:24,072 --> 00:35:25,903
Well, think on it, Marion.

380
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:28,876
Sir Walter is dying without an heir.

381
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:32,902
Peper Harow will fall to the crown,
and you will be living in the hedgerow.

382
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,943
You'll be glad to come to me then.

383
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:10,811
Captain, there.

384
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,905
Sir, we were told
to expect 12 riders and the King.

385
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:36,900
Our beloved King is dead.

386
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,311
Long live the King.

387
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:42,110
Long live the King.

388
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:43,744
And you are, sir?

389
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,857
Sir Robert Loxley of Nottingham.
And you?

390
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,449
I'm the King's equerry, Sir.

391
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:55,928
Come aboard, gentlemen, before the tide
floats her. It's coming in fast.

392
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:11,906
<i>And it's row, me bully boys
We're in a hurry, boys</i>

393
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,211
<i>We got a long way to go</i>

394
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:19,219
<i>Where we'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France</i>

395
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:23,246
<i>And row, me bully boys, row</i>

396
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:28,287
<i>And it's row, me bully boys
We're in a hurry boys</i>

397
00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:31,764
<i>We got a long way to go</i>

398
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:35,394
<i>We'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France</i>

399
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:39,338
<i>And row, me bully boys, row</i>

400
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:46,980
So what's the plan in the morning?

401
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,243
The boat stops at Gravesend
on the way to London.

402
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:54,777
We'll leave the honor of returning
the crown to them, and we'll be gone.

403
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,350
Where?

404
00:37:57,225 --> 00:37:58,419
North.

405
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:02,022
Well, that suits me.

406
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:05,827
<i>Row, me bully boys, row</i>

407
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,733
<i>But now we're returning
So lock up your daughters</i>

408
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,653
<i>We'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France</i>

409
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,720
<i>And it's row, me bully boys, row</i>

410
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:22,101
Make ready, Sir Robert.
We dock in 20 minutes.

411
00:39:22,744 --> 00:39:23,802
Gravesend?

412
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:27,314
No, My Lord.
The palace docks, Tower of London.

413
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:37,783
Will.

414
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,591
John. Allan.

415
00:39:42,263 --> 00:39:44,458
- Where are we?
- London.

416
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:46,131
Holy Christ!

417
00:39:47,702 --> 00:39:49,567
We dock in 10 minutes.

418
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,197
When this is done, be ready to ride.

419
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:54,207
What if...
What if Loxley is known

420
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:56,368
to the King's mother or brother
or any of them?

421
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:58,435
Then we'll be riding for our lives.

422
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:01,949
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Peter and Paul and Mary!

423
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:03,506
I knew it! I knew it!

424
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:06,647
Good morning, My Lord.

425
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:10,179
Some words of advice
on this tragic occasion.

426
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:13,520
You appreciate everything
must be done correctly,

427
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,695
so you will present the crown
to Lady Eleanor.

428
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:18,322
You will go down on the right knee.

429
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:22,267
Do not look in her eyes
when you tell her the King is no more.

430
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:26,137
And do not rise until all others rise.
Do you understand?

431
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:27,299
Yes.

432
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:40,213
Agnes.

433
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:43,049
My blue and gold brocade.

434
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:44,250
Yes, My Lady.

435
00:41:06,114 --> 00:41:07,911
Part for the Queen.

436
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:09,347
Part for the Queen.

437
00:41:34,342 --> 00:41:35,502
Cease.

438
00:41:57,298 --> 00:41:58,890
What's this?
What's happening?

439
00:41:58,966 --> 00:42:01,161
King Richard returns from France,
My Lord.

440
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,805
Did Loxley deceive us?

441
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,069
Kneel.

442
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:52,346
Long life, my son.

443
00:42:53,955 --> 00:42:55,217
Rise now.

444
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,889
A king is dead.

445
00:43:01,963 --> 00:43:04,431
Long live the King.

446
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:08,092
Long live the King!

447
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:10,704
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

448
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:12,867
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

449
00:43:13,608 --> 00:43:14,700
Rise.

450
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:21,041
You...

451
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,310
I don't know you.

452
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:27,614
Robert Loxley, Sire,
of Nottingham.

453
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:30,123
Welcome then.

454
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,118
And how did my brother die?

455
00:43:34,462 --> 00:43:36,623
In battle, Your Majesty,
as was his way.

456
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:39,331
As was his way.

457
00:43:40,134 --> 00:43:41,294
You deserve a reward...

458
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,427
Let's get the horses.

459
00:43:42,503 --> 00:43:43,993
for bringing home the news.

460
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,367
Kneel.

461
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,278
Did you say you were
from Nottingham?

462
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,810
Yes.

463
00:44:01,455 --> 00:44:03,616
Your father, Sir Walter,

464
00:44:05,092 --> 00:44:06,957
owes tax to the crown.

465
00:44:10,264 --> 00:44:11,492
My crown.

466
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,932
Tell him it's bloody expensive
running a country

467
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:15,935
and everyone's got to pay their way.

468
00:44:16,504 --> 00:44:17,869
We'll start with this.

469
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,939
Make way for the King!

470
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:23,599
Make way!

471
00:44:23,678 --> 00:44:24,872
Your Majesty.

472
00:44:24,946 --> 00:44:26,811
Make way for the King!

473
00:44:32,286 --> 00:44:34,015
- Make way!
- Godfrey.

474
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,584
Godfrey, my friend.
It's so good to see you.

475
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:40,093
- How were your travels?
- Good, Sire.

476
00:44:41,295 --> 00:44:42,455
What happened to your face?

477
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:45,427
A hunting accident.
It's nothing.

478
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:48,529
- Frightening.
- Your Majesty.

479
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:52,095
Call it a dueling scar.
The ladies will love you all the more.

480
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,101
I bow to your knowledge
of the ladies, Sire.

481
00:44:59,513 --> 00:45:01,242
You can get up now.

482
00:45:09,757 --> 00:45:11,122
Sir Robert.

483
00:45:15,563 --> 00:45:19,021
You will know of me, perhaps.
I'm William Marshal.

484
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:23,134
Your father and I
were young men together.

485
00:45:23,537 --> 00:45:27,405
Tell him I'm coming to visit him soon,
on spring's first black night.

486
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:31,443
I may have need of him.

487
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,677
I will. I'll tell him.

488
00:45:36,384 --> 00:45:39,820
Whoever he is and whatever he is,
he knows too much.

489
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,314
Get rid of him.

490
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,370
Come on, let's follow.

491
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,265
Forfeit what you got.

492
00:47:04,338 --> 00:47:07,398
Victuals, coin, clothing

493
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:08,975
or your life.

494
00:47:10,878 --> 00:47:13,438
Thomas Cooper.

495
00:47:14,215 --> 00:47:15,614
Is that you?

496
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,717
Are you sick, Thomas?

497
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:24,080
We're all sick.

498
00:47:25,192 --> 00:47:28,059
- Where are the rest of you?
- Don't... Don't tell her.

499
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:29,562
Loop will be angry.

500
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,495
No, it's your mother
who's going to be angry.

501
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:35,592
Now, either you come with me,
or I come with you.

502
00:47:35,669 --> 00:47:37,034
You choose.

503
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,763
Well, come on then.
Where are they?

504
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:43,373
Answer me.

505
00:48:32,193 --> 00:48:34,821
Four men, five horses, one gray.

506
00:48:35,262 --> 00:48:37,492
- Have you seen them?
- That way.

507
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:48,200
<i>The living king of sermons</i>

508
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:50,835
<i>Was delivered from his evil</i>

509
00:48:51,879 --> 00:48:54,814
<i>But he couldn't talk his last</i>

510
00:48:54,882 --> 00:48:57,180
<i>Because God took out his throat</i>

511
00:48:58,385 --> 00:49:01,912
<i>God's crossbow took out his throat</i>

512
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:05,390
By Christ!
Can you not sing a happy tune?

513
00:49:05,893 --> 00:49:11,456
Sing a foot-stomper about adventure
and daring and courage.

514
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:15,024
No. Sing something about a woman.

515
00:49:16,103 --> 00:49:17,730
A large woman.

516
00:49:17,805 --> 00:49:21,468
<i>Fancy army, darling
I loves you all to bits</i>

517
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,807
<i>I'll climb up to your chamber
And under your mountainous...</i>

518
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,473
Right. I'm done.
The money's divided.

519
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:29,782
And so should we be.

520
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:31,341
Where will you go?

521
00:49:34,255 --> 00:49:37,247
I think something is owed
for this good fortune,

522
00:49:37,324 --> 00:49:38,814
and I mean to pay it back.

523
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,087
How so?

524
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:44,725
The inscription on the sword,
it taunts my memory.

525
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,534
Maybe it's just my imagination,
I don't know.

526
00:49:49,003 --> 00:49:52,097
But I intend to take that sword
back to its owner

527
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:53,901
and fulfill the request
of his dying son.

528
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:55,168
Are you mad?

529
00:49:55,709 --> 00:49:57,768
You just said we were
in danger, Robin.

530
00:49:57,845 --> 00:50:00,780
Now you choose to step back
in to harm's way?

531
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:03,810
They're bound to go there
and find you.

532
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:07,945
We can't repay our good luck
with bad grace. It invites darkness.

533
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,655
- I'm going with you.
- And I, Robin.

534
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,357
- Yes.
- No.

535
00:50:17,665 --> 00:50:19,724
Tonight is our last in company.

536
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,769
Tomorrow, we go our separate ways.

537
00:50:24,471 --> 00:50:27,304
Pack up your share.
We eat and sleep.

538
00:50:28,008 --> 00:50:30,408
Will, you're on first watch.

539
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:33,630
Will.

540
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,630
Watch your step!

541
00:52:06,573 --> 00:52:07,631
One of them got away.

542
00:52:09,176 --> 00:52:11,701
Bastards!
They've stolen my fortune.

543
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,478
Richard's army is coming home.

544
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,746
It costs money to keep it together.
Marshal, you speak for the money.

545
00:52:18,819 --> 00:52:19,979
I do, Sire.

546
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,512
But to disband the army
could cost more than to keep it.

547
00:52:26,827 --> 00:52:31,161
King Richard's campaigns were costly.
And the expected returns...

548
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,495
What is that to me, Marshal?

549
00:52:34,268 --> 00:52:36,759
My brother's troubles are over!

550
00:52:38,005 --> 00:52:39,632
They're over!

551
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:42,967
Clear the room.

552
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,683
So... Taxation.

553
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:58,952
Taxation?

554
00:52:59,026 --> 00:53:03,395
Milking a dry udder gets you nothing
but kicked off the milking stool.

555
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,595
Mother, spare me your farmyard memories.

556
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:08,328
You have none,
and I don't understand them.

557
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:10,165
These are difficult times.

558
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,098
We can buy time.

559
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:14,834
I can send envoys to secure loans.

560
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:18,001
There are money chests from Sicily
to Normandy if you know where to look.

561
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:19,940
Cap-in-hand to moneylenders?

562
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:21,846
Your master's a king.

563
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:24,881
The crown is owed money at home.

564
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:29,184
The northern barons plead poverty,
but that's always been the song of rich men.

565
00:53:30,224 --> 00:53:32,089
So, what's to be done?

566
00:53:47,908 --> 00:53:50,934
Give me leave, Sire, to go north
with a company of mounted men.

567
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:53,902
I'll have the merchants and landowners
fill your coffers

568
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,941
or their coffins.

569
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:58,416
Englishmen killing Englishmen.

570
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,545
No man loyal to the crown
has anything to fear.

571
00:54:02,122 --> 00:54:07,116
And loyalty means paying your share
in the defense of the realm.

572
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,852
That's well said.

573
00:54:10,864 --> 00:54:12,559
Hmm? Don't you think, Marshal?

574
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:15,094
Mother?

575
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:20,266
Richard commanded loyalty
not by threats but by example.

576
00:54:20,474 --> 00:54:23,534
Mother, your sainted son
was an imbecile.

577
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:28,974
And you supported his every folly
from here to Jerusalem and back.

578
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,778
Yes, you worshipped him

579
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:36,755
when the warrior lost territories
hard won by his father.

580
00:54:36,957 --> 00:54:39,050
You kissed his picture

581
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:42,391
while England had to pay
four years' revenue

582
00:54:42,462 --> 00:54:44,157
to ransom him when he was captured.

583
00:54:44,231 --> 00:54:46,722
You are just as much to blame as anyone

584
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,530
for the wreckage
which is my inheritance.

585
00:55:03,183 --> 00:55:05,913
I broke her skin more
than she did mine.

586
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,825
Chancellor.

587
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,296
Marshal,

588
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:27,700
you served my brother faithfully
and my father before him.

589
00:55:29,276 --> 00:55:32,143
I think you've spent enough time
with my family

590
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:34,806
and, no doubt,
would like to spend more with your own.

591
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:39,183
Therefore, and with regret,

592
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:43,153
I accept your resignation
of all your offices and matters of state.

593
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,822
The ring.

594
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:57,336
Your Majesty.

595
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,119
Choose carefully, Godfrey, the spot
where you would place your dagger.

596
00:56:29,036 --> 00:56:31,561
For I will choose carefully, as well.

597
00:56:54,861 --> 00:56:56,385
Open the gates!

598
00:57:32,499 --> 00:57:33,864
Nottingham.

599
00:57:35,135 --> 00:57:37,933
- Is this your people, Robin?
- I don't know. Might be.

600
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:41,773
They don't look much,
these Middle Englanders.

601
00:57:41,842 --> 00:57:44,504
Well, they've been keeping your lot
in place easy enough, haven't they?

602
00:57:44,578 --> 00:57:47,411
I hear that you Welsh boys,
you live on leeks.

603
00:57:47,814 --> 00:57:49,782
You co-habit with sheep.

604
00:57:52,352 --> 00:57:54,217
Bloody Scottish mule.

605
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:59,247
You wouldn't want to annoy a bee hive
with your noise, would you?

606
00:57:59,326 --> 00:58:01,260
Your swords would be
no good then, gentlemen.

607
00:58:01,528 --> 00:58:02,620
You're the town beekeeper?

608
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:06,697
Bless you, no. I'm the friar.
Tuck's the name.

609
00:58:07,267 --> 00:58:10,703
Well, Friar Tuck, can you tell me
where I might find Sir Walter Loxley?

610
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:13,234
If he's not up at Peper Harow...

611
00:58:15,842 --> 00:58:17,104
How long will your business take?

612
00:58:22,215 --> 00:58:23,239
Stay safe.

613
00:58:23,984 --> 00:58:25,246
God be with you all.

614
00:58:32,459 --> 00:58:33,585
That's it?

615
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,093
After 10 years?

616
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:39,599
Good Friar,
where can a man get, well,

617
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:41,725
moderately insensible
on a drink around here?

618
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:45,265
Allan, he's a man of the cloth.
I'm sorry, Friar.

619
00:58:46,573 --> 00:58:48,768
- Have you coin?
- I have coin.

620
00:58:49,476 --> 00:58:50,875
Two pieces.

621
00:58:51,678 --> 00:58:52,770
Each.

622
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,882
Have you tried the honey liquor
we call mead?

623
00:58:58,919 --> 00:59:00,386
Come with me.

624
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:03,284
Gives a man a halo, does mead.

625
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,046
Girl.

626
00:59:37,122 --> 00:59:38,113
Girl?

627
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,529
Either you're going blind
or you're looking for charity.

628
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,990
Are you the keeper of this house?

629
00:59:48,068 --> 00:59:50,263
In a manner of speaking, yes.

630
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,467
I wish to see Sir Walter Loxley.

631
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:55,967
And you are?

632
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:57,571
Robin Longstride.

633
00:59:57,644 --> 00:59:59,612
Plain Robin Longstride?
No Sir?

634
01:00:00,113 --> 01:00:02,172
No, ma'am.
No Sir.

635
01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:07,284
Are you here about the tax?

636
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:12,522
No, I'm here to bring him his sword.
His son's dead.

637
01:00:14,761 --> 01:00:16,023
This way.

638
01:00:37,951 --> 01:00:39,816
He'll take your horse.

639
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:52,925
Marion!

640
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:54,861
Marion!

641
01:00:55,135 --> 01:00:57,330
Maggie, where is she?

642
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,130
Ma'am, Sir Walter calls for you.

643
01:01:00,206 --> 01:01:02,606
I know, Margaret.
I can hear him.

644
01:01:03,143 --> 01:01:05,134
Tell him we have a guest.

645
01:01:14,487 --> 01:01:17,923
I'm Marion Loxley.
Robert's wife.

646
01:01:22,195 --> 01:01:25,187
My Lady, I owe you an apology.
If I'd have known...

647
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:28,530
Bad news is bad news
no matter how it comes.

648
01:01:29,836 --> 01:01:34,273
Indeed, I owe you thanks for taking
the time to deliver it here yourself.

649
01:01:35,075 --> 01:01:37,566
Did you fight alongside my husband?

650
01:01:39,245 --> 01:01:40,303
Yes.

651
01:01:41,715 --> 01:01:42,909
Did he die well?

652
01:01:47,153 --> 01:01:48,484
In an ambush, ma'am.

653
01:01:48,755 --> 01:01:52,088
He was the man chosen
to bring home Richard's crown.

654
01:01:52,325 --> 01:01:54,384
Marion, who is here?

655
01:01:55,762 --> 01:01:57,491
A traveler, Walter.

656
01:02:03,069 --> 01:02:05,537
This news will go very hard on him.

657
01:02:05,605 --> 01:02:06,697
Bring him in.

658
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:08,035
Yes, yes.

659
01:02:08,575 --> 01:02:11,772
Tell him Robert is in the Holy Land,
sends his love and will return soon.

660
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,240
Marion, our traveler will be thirsty.

661
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:19,376
Travelers are always thirsty.
Is that not so?

662
01:02:19,452 --> 01:02:20,578
Your name, sir?

663
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,782
Longstride.
Robin Longstride.

664
01:02:26,426 --> 01:02:27,552
Do you mock me?

665
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:30,453
Sir?

666
01:02:31,765 --> 01:02:33,027
Your son,

667
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:36,598
he asked me to bring you this.

668
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:49,580
And how does Robert defend himself
if he has no sword?

669
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:54,085
The prodigal son
will not return after all.

670
01:02:56,756 --> 01:03:00,920
So, no tears,
no forgiveness from his father.

671
01:03:05,165 --> 01:03:06,962
No amends to be made.

672
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,305
Did you see him die?

673
01:03:19,646 --> 01:03:21,876
I was with him when he passed.

674
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:25,885
His final words were for the love and bond
between a father and son.

675
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,453
Forgive my rudeness.

676
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:32,719
My grief has been waiting
for this day.

677
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:36,919
So come, so that I may see you.

678
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:54,403
Robin Longstride.

679
01:03:55,648 --> 01:03:58,981
A common enough
but noble Saxon name.

680
01:04:01,287 --> 01:04:04,256
So, you will dine with us.

681
01:04:05,658 --> 01:04:08,149
But first, you must bathe, sir.

682
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:09,687
You stink.

683
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:21,905
I've laid out some of my husband's clothes.
I hope you don't find that too discomforting.

684
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,538
My Lady,

685
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,641
I'll need some help
with the chain mail.

686
01:04:30,884 --> 01:04:32,146
Winifred.

687
01:04:33,753 --> 01:04:35,015
Winifred.

688
01:04:43,596 --> 01:04:47,123
The coif has a clasp
at the nape of the neck.

689
01:04:56,576 --> 01:05:00,569
If you take off the coif,
you'll find lacings in the back of the tabard.

690
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,683
Thank you.

691
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:40,514
I'll have it washed.

692
01:05:57,937 --> 01:05:59,598
Marion, more wine.

693
01:06:04,477 --> 01:06:07,503
You've taken a long road
to bring this to me.

694
01:06:07,614 --> 01:06:11,015
I cannot decide whether that
makes you trustworthy...

695
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:12,676
Or manipulative.

696
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:18,351
Marion, I'm merely trying to gauge
the quality of the man we have as our guest.

697
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:20,315
Is he handsome?

698
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:21,952
Yes.

699
01:06:23,763 --> 01:06:27,722
In the way that yeomen sometimes are
when they are sober.

700
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,701
Entertain us
with a tale of your life, sir.

701
01:06:31,337 --> 01:06:34,067
We don't get many visitors anymore.

702
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,870
Except tax collectors and other beggars.

703
01:06:37,644 --> 01:06:40,943
I don't know where I'm from.
Only know where I've been.

704
01:06:41,014 --> 01:06:44,381
So, Marion,
what color are his eyes?

705
01:06:49,489 --> 01:06:51,116
I don't yet know.

706
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:56,487
I have a proposal for you,
young man.

707
01:06:58,131 --> 01:07:01,157
You brought me this sword,
which has great meaning.

708
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:03,198
If you give me your time,

709
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,601
it is yours.

710
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:10,436
I could stay for a day, or more.

711
01:07:13,146 --> 01:07:16,775
- I have a question to ask you.
- And what is your question?

712
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:19,841
The words on the hilt of the sword,
what do they mean?

713
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:25,723
Well, I think I have much to tell you
about history. About your history.

714
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:34,230
That's very kind.

715
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,463
Well, you haven't heard the other half
of my proposal yet.

716
01:07:37,537 --> 01:07:41,564
I want you to stay in Nottingham
and, for the time being,

717
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:45,737
become my returned son,
and therefore Marion's spouse.

718
01:07:45,845 --> 01:07:47,073
Oh, that's enough!

719
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,738
- You've had too much to drink.
- Listen. Listen. Listen.

720
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:53,115
We both know that without a husband
you will lose this land when I die.

721
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,681
Do you dispute that? Hmm?

722
01:07:55,755 --> 01:07:58,485
- No.
- No, so if I say this is my son,

723
01:07:58,558 --> 01:08:04,224
he will be seen as that.
And, so, as your husband. Huh?

724
01:08:04,297 --> 01:08:06,026
It is a fair contract.

725
01:08:06,265 --> 01:08:10,326
It is not as if I expect you
to have children or...

726
01:08:11,104 --> 01:08:15,234
No, the sword for your time, Longstride.

727
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:16,970
Are you in agreement?

728
01:08:18,578 --> 01:08:21,411
- Yes.
- Marion, go tell the staff

729
01:08:21,714 --> 01:08:25,912
that my son has arrived
and our home is now whole again.

730
01:08:26,919 --> 01:08:29,683
Tell them to ring
the church bells in celebration.

731
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,388
And more wine, please.

732
01:08:42,802 --> 01:08:44,463
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

733
01:08:49,575 --> 01:08:50,974
<i>I rose up in the morning</i>

734
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,239
<i>And I felt a dire need</i>

735
01:08:53,312 --> 01:08:56,839
<i>To dream away the dreary day
and down a cup of mead</i>

736
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:58,975
<i>I felt the sting of honeybees</i>

737
01:08:59,419 --> 01:09:00,750
Home brew.

738
01:09:02,088 --> 01:09:06,491
If I wasn't the village priest,
I'd try for the village drunkard.

739
01:09:08,694 --> 01:09:09,752
Oh, great.

740
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:13,264
A man could get
very affectionate here.

741
01:09:13,332 --> 01:09:18,793
I haven't seen so many women
for so few men outside a nunnery.

742
01:09:19,539 --> 01:09:23,999
The secret to success
is never go for the prettiest one.

743
01:09:24,811 --> 01:09:26,972
Start with the homely one
on the left.

744
01:09:30,983 --> 01:09:32,177
Right there.

745
01:09:32,552 --> 01:09:35,646
She's about my size.
I'm going to make her smile.

746
01:09:36,622 --> 01:09:39,022
I'm going to make you smile!

747
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:40,583
Come over here!

748
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,661
So, why do they call you Little John?

749
01:09:43,729 --> 01:09:45,060
What are you trying to get at?

750
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,293
I'm proportionate.

751
01:09:47,366 --> 01:09:50,426
<i>So roll another barrel to the bar</i>

752
01:09:50,503 --> 01:09:54,234
<i>And pour another cup or two
so I can soak my heart</i>

753
01:10:43,289 --> 01:10:44,517
Stop it.

754
01:10:47,927 --> 01:10:49,292
What did I tell you?

755
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,697
It seems we are to share my chamber.

756
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,542
A ruse to convince the servants.

757
01:11:06,379 --> 01:11:09,405
Well, if the aim is deception,

758
01:11:09,982 --> 01:11:15,352
should you not be addressing me as
"My husband," or, "My dear"?

759
01:11:16,088 --> 01:11:18,556
Don't be ridiculous.

760
01:11:22,662 --> 01:11:24,789
Well, are you coming or not?

761
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:29,929
Ask me nicely.

762
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:41,676
Please, dear husband,
will you share my chamber?

763
01:12:18,484 --> 01:12:19,542
Here.

764
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:25,319
I sleep with a dagger.

765
01:12:25,391 --> 01:12:29,327
If you so much as move to touch me,
I will sever your manhood.

766
01:12:29,395 --> 01:12:30,657
You understand?

767
01:12:30,997 --> 01:12:32,055
Thanks for the warning.

768
01:12:38,971 --> 01:12:40,233
Hello, dogs.

769
01:14:35,988 --> 01:14:37,216
Godfrey.

770
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,529
Where are your men?

771
01:14:50,536 --> 01:14:51,764
They're dead, My Lord.

772
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,031
And Loxley?

773
01:14:54,306 --> 01:14:55,466
Alive.

774
01:14:59,145 --> 01:15:00,544
Then fate has left him to me.

775
01:15:12,858 --> 01:15:16,885
I hear a man's steps.
Good morning, my son.

776
01:15:17,696 --> 01:15:19,163
Morning, Walter.

777
01:15:20,332 --> 01:15:21,424
Father.

778
01:15:21,801 --> 01:15:23,029
Father.

779
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,135
So what is it that you know
of my history?

780
01:15:26,205 --> 01:15:27,502
Patience.

781
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:31,603
You must show yourself today.
Wear your sword.

782
01:15:33,145 --> 01:15:34,134
Marion.

783
01:15:35,147 --> 01:15:36,375
I'm here, Walter.

784
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:40,442
Reacquaint your husband
with his village and his people.

785
01:15:42,321 --> 01:15:44,619
I'll see to the horses.

786
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:46,414
I feel invigorated.

787
01:15:46,592 --> 01:15:49,993
I woke this morning
with a tumescent glow.

788
01:15:50,663 --> 01:15:51,857
Eighty-four.

789
01:15:52,665 --> 01:15:54,030
A miracle.

790
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:59,229
I've always wondered
at the private conversations of men.

791
01:16:00,039 --> 01:16:01,336
Husband.

792
01:16:21,694 --> 01:16:23,525
This is rich country.

793
01:16:24,129 --> 01:16:26,097
Where's your cattle and your sheep?

794
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:30,124
Sold, eaten, stolen, traded.
We've had seven lean years.

795
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,035
Our meat now is rabbit

796
01:16:33,105 --> 01:16:35,801
or wild pig on a lucky day.

797
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:37,172
And deer?

798
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:41,412
If you're willing to risk your neck
to the King's executioner.

799
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:44,442
Every deer in the land
belongs to His Majesty.

800
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:47,281
These things are God's gifts first
before the King's possessions.

801
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,720
If it's illegal for a man
to fend for himself

802
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,690
how then can he be a man
in his own right?

803
01:16:53,759 --> 01:16:55,624
Welcome home, sir.

804
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:58,891
Sir Robert.
Good morning, Joseph. Emma.

805
01:17:00,466 --> 01:17:04,425
Sir Walter is our Lord, and you
are Robert returned and you should act so.

806
01:17:07,139 --> 01:17:09,437
Sir Robert.
You remember me?

807
01:17:09,508 --> 01:17:12,033
Tom Chamberlain.
Pig farmer.

808
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:13,902
You don't look a day older, Tom.

809
01:17:14,914 --> 01:17:16,279
Sir Robert.

810
01:17:16,916 --> 01:17:19,214
When will our young lads
come back to us?

811
01:17:19,785 --> 01:17:22,720
Will you find my Jamie,
tell him to come home?

812
01:17:25,491 --> 01:17:29,325
With no work and little food,
the village boys have gone.

813
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:31,795
- To be soldiers?
- Poachers.

814
01:17:37,169 --> 01:17:38,602
Look at that, mate.

815
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,335
Still here then?

816
01:17:45,311 --> 01:17:49,407
For the time being, refer to me
as Sir Robert. I'll explain later.

817
01:17:49,815 --> 01:17:53,649
My men-at-arms.
This is about as courtly as they get.

818
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:57,487
Allan A'Dayle, Will Scarlet
and Little John.

819
01:17:57,556 --> 01:17:58,682
Lady Marion.

820
01:18:05,497 --> 01:18:08,523
I trust you had an historic evening.

821
01:18:09,068 --> 01:18:10,228
For sure.

822
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:18,072
Lady Marion Loxley.
My wife.

823
01:18:18,844 --> 01:18:20,311
Well played.

824
01:18:20,846 --> 01:18:24,179
A bit rash but well played nonetheless.

825
01:18:24,249 --> 01:18:25,841
Right you are, Robin.

826
01:18:26,051 --> 01:18:27,348
Sir Robert.

827
01:18:27,419 --> 01:18:29,011
- Sir Robert.
- Sir...

828
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,419
- Sir.
- Sir.

829
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:33,151
- Sir Bob.
- Sir Robert.

830
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:41,728
Friar.

831
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:47,966
Ah, Marion. Good news travels
from Peper Harow this morning.

832
01:18:48,774 --> 01:18:51,265
Sir Robert, nice to see you again.

833
01:18:51,343 --> 01:18:55,040
You should've made yourself known
when we met in the field. Welcome home.

834
01:18:55,748 --> 01:18:58,410
Yes, I should've.
Forgive me, Friar.

835
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,119
What happens here?

836
01:19:01,186 --> 01:19:03,654
We're moving
the Church's grain to York.

837
01:19:03,722 --> 01:19:05,485
Politics out of London, I hear.

838
01:19:05,557 --> 01:19:08,526
This is our grain.
It belongs in this soil.

839
01:19:08,594 --> 01:19:11,620
Lady Marion, I but follow
the orders of my superiors

840
01:19:11,697 --> 01:19:14,097
and abide by their saying and rule.

841
01:19:19,138 --> 01:19:21,629
Does His Holiness know
about your wealth of honey?

842
01:19:23,575 --> 01:19:27,807
There are wolves in York, Sir Robert.
Voracious wolves.

843
01:19:29,214 --> 01:19:30,909
The bees are my family.

844
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,511
I'm a procreator by design.

845
01:19:34,219 --> 01:19:36,983
I'm not a churchy friar.
Never was.

846
01:19:37,823 --> 01:19:39,586
My bees give life.

847
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:42,055
They are my life, Sir Robert.

848
01:19:42,127 --> 01:19:44,027
Should not the Bishop be told

849
01:19:44,163 --> 01:19:47,291
so the clergy can spread
Nottingham honey on Nottingham bread?

850
01:19:50,602 --> 01:19:53,503
What if the grain
were not to reach York?

851
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:58,307
Then the bees need not be spoken of.

852
01:20:07,419 --> 01:20:10,650
I was an old maid
when Robert courted me.

853
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:15,092
I was a daughter of a respectable widow
with a thimbleful of noble blood.

854
01:20:15,527 --> 01:20:19,258
We were wed,
and then a week later

855
01:20:19,665 --> 01:20:23,431
he left to join ship for France
and the Holy Lands.

856
01:20:23,502 --> 01:20:26,528
And that was my married life to a man

857
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,235
I hardly knew.

858
01:20:33,278 --> 01:20:35,712
- A good knight.
- Short, but sweet.

859
01:20:36,782 --> 01:20:39,910
I mean, he was a good knight.

860
01:20:40,486 --> 01:20:42,477
A good knight-at-arms, a soldier.

861
01:20:42,554 --> 01:20:44,886
Oh, yes, my knight-in-arms,
even so.

862
01:20:44,957 --> 01:20:46,720
And I in his.

863
01:21:17,589 --> 01:21:20,023
Stop! You'll break its neck.

864
01:21:33,105 --> 01:21:34,333
Marion.

865
01:21:43,415 --> 01:21:44,541
Easy.

866
01:21:48,287 --> 01:21:49,481
I'm all right.

867
01:21:51,857 --> 01:21:53,654
I can't move me legs.

868
01:21:54,693 --> 01:21:56,058
I can't move me legs.

869
01:21:58,463 --> 01:21:59,691
Thank you.

870
01:22:02,935 --> 01:22:04,266
My Lord?

871
01:22:17,282 --> 01:22:19,079
Oh, is it my turn now?

872
01:22:28,293 --> 01:22:29,453
Thank you.

873
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:33,955
Nicely done, sir.

874
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:38,867
And to see Lady Marion Loxley's legs,
beyond my wildest hopes this morning.

875
01:22:41,073 --> 01:22:45,032
I don't believe you know my husband,

876
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:46,568
Sir Robert.

877
01:22:46,645 --> 01:22:50,240
Allow me to introduce
the Sheriff of Nottingham.

878
01:22:50,315 --> 01:22:52,044
Welcome home, Sir Robert.

879
01:22:52,117 --> 01:22:55,985
You make your mark quickly by rescuing
the King's ram from drowning.

880
01:22:56,488 --> 01:22:57,546
What's this?

881
01:22:57,623 --> 01:23:01,855
What's mine in coin I have the right
to take in goods or livestock.

882
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,858
If it's God's will.

883
01:23:08,467 --> 01:23:10,958
Here's a ram's worth of tax
for the Exchequer.

884
01:23:11,036 --> 01:23:15,496
Your insolence to Lady Marion,
I'll consider a debt between us.

885
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,764
Mead and grain alcohol?

886
01:23:43,835 --> 01:23:46,133
I thought as much.

887
01:23:49,241 --> 01:23:51,436
There's something that we need to do.

888
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:53,273
At your service.

889
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,019
All right, lads.

890
01:24:07,092 --> 01:24:11,392
Should've left while you had the chance.
Something's afoot. Off we go.

891
01:24:27,012 --> 01:24:29,139
Stop. Stop the horses.

892
01:24:31,249 --> 01:24:34,912
You there! Move aside!
We're on Church business!

893
01:24:35,921 --> 01:24:37,855
None shall pass

894
01:24:37,923 --> 01:24:40,551
unless they can answer the riddle.

895
01:24:40,959 --> 01:24:42,790
Moon-mad!

896
01:24:42,861 --> 01:24:46,490
And what is the riddle,
you insolent wretch?

897
01:24:47,299 --> 01:24:51,827
What has 18 legs
and isn't going anywhere?

898
01:24:54,873 --> 01:24:57,205
Your next move will be your last.

899
01:24:58,443 --> 01:24:59,705
Evening, friend.

900
01:25:01,747 --> 01:25:04,181
I demand to know who you are.

901
01:25:04,649 --> 01:25:05,843
We are men of the hood.

902
01:25:08,453 --> 01:25:10,011
Merry now, at your expense.

903
01:25:11,456 --> 01:25:12,787
"The Lord taketh..."

904
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,257
And we shall giveth back.

905
01:25:14,326 --> 01:25:16,851
My advice is to plant it now,
by moonlight.

906
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:18,253
Why is that, good friar?

907
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:21,424
When it sprouts,
I can claim it as a miracle from God.

908
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,526
The Church in York
would never deny a miracle.

909
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:31,437
- How much further?
- About 11 miles.

910
01:26:21,827 --> 01:26:23,852
I thought you had left.

911
01:26:24,896 --> 01:26:27,057
The fields have been planted.

912
01:26:27,866 --> 01:26:29,891
I didn't want to wake you.

913
01:26:30,469 --> 01:26:32,130
How did you find the seed?

914
01:26:32,838 --> 01:26:35,204
If you have to ask,
it's not a gift.

915
01:26:37,309 --> 01:26:38,776
Thank you.

916
01:27:24,422 --> 01:27:25,753
Pikemen, at the ready!

917
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,189
Arms to ready!

918
01:27:27,759 --> 01:27:29,249
Prepare!

919
01:27:30,061 --> 01:27:32,552
This King John is no king of mine!

920
01:27:34,132 --> 01:27:36,965
You! Are you Baldwin?
Open these gates!

921
01:27:37,035 --> 01:27:38,798
In whose name do you come against us?

922
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,895
In the name of King John.

923
01:27:41,306 --> 01:27:43,866
Pay or burn.

924
01:27:43,942 --> 01:27:47,434
We have paid in money and men
for King Richard's wars!

925
01:27:47,646 --> 01:27:49,773
And we have no more to give!

926
01:27:49,915 --> 01:27:51,746
- Burn it.
- Archers!

927
01:28:11,803 --> 01:28:13,031
Come on.

928
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,847
My Lord, this way!

929
01:28:31,156 --> 01:28:33,181
<i>In the name of John,</i>

930
01:28:33,258 --> 01:28:36,421
<i>by the Grace of God,
King of England,</i>

931
01:28:36,494 --> 01:28:42,023
<i>let it be known to all who abide here
that a tax is warranted!</i>

932
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:51,004
<i>Those persons refusing
to abide by the law</i>

933
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:54,534
<i>will hereby be subject
to severe punishment.</i>

934
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:02,409
<i>By order of His Majesty,
King John.</i>

935
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:15,263
Father Tancred!

936
01:29:32,917 --> 01:29:34,248
Your Majesty.

937
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:39,180
Your Majesty.

938
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,857
I have lost the confidence of King John,

939
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:47,094
but he may still listen to you.

940
01:29:47,165 --> 01:29:49,633
Allow me to know better, William.

941
01:29:49,868 --> 01:29:52,200
You are much wiser than your owl.

942
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:55,398
I dare say.
I've lived longer.

943
01:29:56,741 --> 01:29:58,470
Edward, take him.

944
01:29:58,543 --> 01:29:59,601
Your Majesty.

945
01:30:03,114 --> 01:30:06,447
John is no Richard, alas,
Your Majesty.

946
01:30:08,586 --> 01:30:13,250
But I serve the throne,
and the throne will endure.

947
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,929
Speak plainly, Marshal.
What's troubling you?

948
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,655
The crown is in peril.

949
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:26,132
Godfrey has been plotting
with Philip of France.

950
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:29,197
French troops have already landed
on our shores,

951
01:30:29,274 --> 01:30:32,004
and they are murdering Englishmen
in the name of King John.

952
01:30:32,877 --> 01:30:36,870
The northern barons
will make civil war against the throne.

953
01:30:37,148 --> 01:30:40,481
Leaving our coast defenseless
against the invasion

954
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:43,211
which is certainly coming.

955
01:30:45,657 --> 01:30:50,651
So it's left to John's mother to scold him
like a child and point him to his duty.

956
01:30:56,468 --> 01:31:01,030
My son has an enemy in his court
closer to him than any friend.

957
01:31:01,139 --> 01:31:04,700
An English traitor.
A paid agent of France.

958
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,903
Why are you telling me
when you must tell the King?

959
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:10,413
Isabella!

960
01:31:11,483 --> 01:31:13,713
It is you who must do that.

961
01:31:14,285 --> 01:31:18,415
Tell King John that you've had word from France,
from Philip himself, if you like.

962
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:21,653
Why not tell him the truth?
That William Marshal...

963
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:26,425
Oh! A mother he mistrusts
bearing the word of a man in dishonor?

964
01:31:26,498 --> 01:31:27,624
No.

965
01:31:28,533 --> 01:31:32,902
If you wish to be queen,
you must save John.

966
01:31:34,439 --> 01:31:35,872
And England.

967
01:31:37,342 --> 01:31:38,536
No!

968
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:41,208
No! No!

969
01:31:44,149 --> 01:31:47,084
Godfrey! The bloody Judas!

970
01:31:47,852 --> 01:31:50,446
By the bowels of Christ,
it's a lie.

971
01:31:50,522 --> 01:31:52,353
You lie!

972
01:32:11,075 --> 01:32:13,236
I'm sorry, my love.

973
01:32:29,227 --> 01:32:31,218
- Sheriff.
- Up there.

974
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:38,330
Man won't give his name.
Demands audience with the sheriff.

975
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:40,235
Demands?

976
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:45,234
- Go away.
- My Lord.

977
01:33:07,432 --> 01:33:10,060
Tax collections proceed apace.

978
01:33:11,035 --> 01:33:12,832
Nottingham's turn is coming.

979
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:15,139
Good. Good.

980
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:19,106
Tell Sir Godfrey
that the Sheriff of Nottingham is his man.

981
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:21,907
May he put his stamp
on my authority.

982
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:26,747
I see trouble
coming from Loxley of Peper Harow.

983
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:29,183
A blind old man gives you trouble?

984
01:33:29,254 --> 01:33:31,415
Aye, and his son will give more.

985
01:33:31,589 --> 01:33:35,821
The crusader, Robert Loxley,
has returned this past week.

986
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:14,592
Marion.

987
01:35:18,329 --> 01:35:20,422
Go on! Go on.

988
01:35:25,903 --> 01:35:27,461
Has he spoken yet?

989
01:35:27,705 --> 01:35:28,831
He was spying, Loop.

990
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:30,706
Spying?

991
01:35:32,243 --> 01:35:34,711
Robert, I'm ashamed of you.

992
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:36,477
Hello, Marion.

993
01:35:36,914 --> 01:35:38,347
I've come to save you.

994
01:35:39,617 --> 01:35:40,743
Know him?

995
01:35:41,419 --> 01:35:46,049
Boys, this is Sir Robert Loxley,
my husband.

996
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:49,619
Sir Robert, the runaways of Sherwood.

997
01:35:50,595 --> 01:35:51,926
Untie him.

998
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:55,796
No, I don't think spies should be
let off so easily.

999
01:35:56,401 --> 01:35:57,766
That was unkind.

1000
01:35:57,835 --> 01:35:59,632
You were a crusader?

1001
01:35:59,771 --> 01:36:00,829
Yes.

1002
01:36:00,905 --> 01:36:03,874
Did you hear that, boys?
You bested a crusader.

1003
01:36:05,276 --> 01:36:07,540
- My men are good fighters.
- I don't know about that.

1004
01:36:07,612 --> 01:36:10,046
I think the weight of numbers
might have been in their favor.

1005
01:36:10,114 --> 01:36:12,844
But they do move silently
like the creatures of the forest.

1006
01:36:12,917 --> 01:36:15,044
But that's only a skill
if you stay as a man.

1007
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,212
You don't become the creatures you hunt.

1008
01:36:17,288 --> 01:36:19,620
- We're soldiers.
- No, you're not.

1009
01:36:19,791 --> 01:36:22,817
Soldiers fight for a cause.
What's yours?

1010
01:36:25,063 --> 01:36:28,032
You don't have one.
That makes you poachers.

1011
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:32,734
Common thieves with a lot to learn.

1012
01:36:32,804 --> 01:36:33,896
Like what?

1013
01:36:33,971 --> 01:36:36,235
I could teach you how to tie knots.

1014
01:36:36,307 --> 01:36:39,208
I could teach you which wood to get
to make your bows stronger.

1015
01:36:39,277 --> 01:36:43,509
I could teach you how to make arrows
that fly more than 20 feet.

1016
01:36:43,948 --> 01:36:47,281
And I can help Marion to teach you
how to stay clean

1017
01:36:47,418 --> 01:36:49,386
so you won't get sick.

1018
01:36:49,854 --> 01:36:54,484
I don't know who you're fighting, son,
but it's not me. I'm not your enemy.

1019
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,487
If you want to chat,
you know where to find me.

1020
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:13,870
Wife?

1021
01:37:21,519 --> 01:37:23,009
Marshal.

1022
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:25,954
Stand aside!
Make way for the King!

1023
01:37:26,023 --> 01:37:27,547
Your Majesty.

1024
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,295
What the devil are you doing here?
Hmm?

1025
01:37:32,363 --> 01:37:33,455
Sire?

1026
01:37:33,531 --> 01:37:36,398
Will you keep that animal still?
What's it got, palsy?

1027
01:37:38,903 --> 01:37:40,996
Do you think I haven't noticed
how you've deserted me?

1028
01:37:41,072 --> 01:37:43,506
If Your Majesty recalls,
our last conversation...

1029
01:37:43,574 --> 01:37:44,973
At our last conversation,

1030
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:48,341
Philip of France wasn't coming our way
with an invasion fleet.

1031
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,743
Was he, Marshal?

1032
01:37:54,485 --> 01:37:56,350
My friend Godfrey

1033
01:37:57,255 --> 01:38:00,088
is not the friend I thought he was.

1034
01:38:00,892 --> 01:38:03,622
He's stirred up
the northern barons against me.

1035
01:38:04,195 --> 01:38:06,527
They come south with an army.

1036
01:38:08,166 --> 01:38:10,600
Marshal, how dare they?
How dare they?

1037
01:38:10,668 --> 01:38:13,501
Sire, forgotten men are dangerous men.

1038
01:38:15,706 --> 01:38:18,266
<i>The barons need to be told</i>

1039
01:38:18,843 --> 01:38:22,279
<i>that when the French come,
we are all Englishmen.</i>

1040
01:38:23,347 --> 01:38:25,611
- Fitzrobert.
- Baldwin.

1041
01:38:26,684 --> 01:38:29,983
We'll make an army of the north
and march on London.

1042
01:38:30,588 --> 01:38:32,715
The barons need leadership.

1043
01:38:33,024 --> 01:38:36,926
Wiser kings know they must
let men look them in the eye,

1044
01:38:37,795 --> 01:38:39,695
hear their voice.

1045
01:38:40,364 --> 01:38:43,925
Together, let us ride north
to meet them.

1046
01:38:46,737 --> 01:38:49,331
They march against their king, Marshal.

1047
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:53,166
Their king.

1048
01:38:54,645 --> 01:38:58,638
We will meet them with the pikes
of our militia in their gizzards.

1049
01:38:59,317 --> 01:39:01,581
You have lost your touch, Marshal.

1050
01:39:03,821 --> 01:39:06,221
Perhaps we'll look to the barons
without you.

1051
01:39:17,401 --> 01:39:20,564
Saddle up with a spare horse.
I leave immediately.

1052
01:39:20,638 --> 01:39:22,162
I want to know where to find Godfrey.

1053
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,571
My Lord.

1054
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:41,317
- I found him, My Lord.
- Where?

1055
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:45,658
Nottingham. In plain sight,
living as Walter Loxley's son.

1056
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:53,594
Then we go to Nottingham.

1057
01:39:54,105 --> 01:39:57,131
Take no prisoners.
Leave no stone un-scorched.

1058
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:02,409
Take two men, four horses.

1059
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:06,712
Ride hard for the coast, then on to Paris
and give a message to the King.

1060
01:40:24,468 --> 01:40:26,766
I'll make the place famous.

1061
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:31,764
Come, Allan!

1062
01:40:31,842 --> 01:40:34,970
I'll get them drinking.
You get them dancing!

1063
01:40:35,079 --> 01:40:36,137
All right.

1064
01:41:07,144 --> 01:41:12,241
Music, laughter, the crackle
of a bonfire and a roasting pig.

1065
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:16,077
Life has returned.
You have returned it, Robin.

1066
01:43:16,307 --> 01:43:18,275
How did you know it was me?

1067
01:43:18,342 --> 01:43:21,937
Who else would sit by me uninvited

1068
01:43:22,746 --> 01:43:25,340
like a friend from the old days?

1069
01:43:25,916 --> 01:43:27,577
How are you, William?

1070
01:43:28,385 --> 01:43:31,218
I'm well and troubled.

1071
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:33,779
Ah. And what brings you?

1072
01:43:34,058 --> 01:43:36,925
I'm riding on to Barnsdale tonight.

1073
01:43:37,094 --> 01:43:41,326
I've heard something of the barons' anger
against the crown's tax collector...

1074
01:43:41,398 --> 01:43:43,798
The anger has turned into action.

1075
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:46,027
They assemble to march against the King.

1076
01:43:46,370 --> 01:43:48,736
You think you can persuade
the barons to turn back?

1077
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:49,898
Turn back, no.

1078
01:43:51,108 --> 01:43:55,044
To join King John
against a French invasion.

1079
01:43:56,247 --> 01:43:58,340
- A what?
- Help me, Walter.

1080
01:43:58,716 --> 01:44:00,650
I cannot go with you.

1081
01:44:01,619 --> 01:44:03,348
I cannot speak for this king.

1082
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:05,012
He is the only king we have.

1083
01:44:05,089 --> 01:44:06,488
But not the only hope.

1084
01:44:07,591 --> 01:44:08,751
Explain.

1085
01:44:10,327 --> 01:44:12,557
- Marion.
- I'm here, Walter.

1086
01:44:12,897 --> 01:44:15,161
This is my old friend,
William Marshal.

1087
01:44:15,232 --> 01:44:17,723
Lady Marion Loxley, my son's wife.

1088
01:44:17,801 --> 01:44:20,668
Lady, I was glad to see Sir Robert
when he disembarked in London.

1089
01:44:20,738 --> 01:44:23,229
I think you know better, Marshal.

1090
01:44:23,307 --> 01:44:28,074
Sir William, I know, would like
to meet Robin Longstride again.

1091
01:44:39,256 --> 01:44:40,689
We've met before.

1092
01:44:40,758 --> 01:44:43,158
Yes, Sir, I know.
In London.

1093
01:44:44,995 --> 01:44:47,395
No, when you were a child.

1094
01:44:49,266 --> 01:44:50,893
Hobby-horse age.

1095
01:44:51,669 --> 01:44:55,571
Sir Walter and I returned from
the Holy Land to fetch you home.

1096
01:44:56,106 --> 01:44:57,368
But you'd gone.

1097
01:44:57,441 --> 01:45:00,569
We had lost Thomas Longstride's son.

1098
01:45:03,113 --> 01:45:06,674
It was a wound that never healed.

1099
01:45:13,624 --> 01:45:16,616
You need to know what I know.

1100
01:45:17,628 --> 01:45:20,563
Your father was a stonemason.

1101
01:45:21,765 --> 01:45:23,756
Is that pleasing to you?

1102
01:45:26,003 --> 01:45:28,130
Yes. It is.

1103
01:45:28,872 --> 01:45:32,035
But he was more than that.
He was a visionary.

1104
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:34,471
What did he see?

1105
01:45:35,045 --> 01:45:37,707
That kings have a need of their subjects

1106
01:45:37,781 --> 01:45:41,649
no less than their subjects
have need of kings.

1107
01:45:41,719 --> 01:45:43,380
A dangerous idea.

1108
01:45:43,954 --> 01:45:47,219
Your father was a philosopher.
He had a way of speaking

1109
01:45:47,291 --> 01:45:50,419
that took you by the ears
and by the heart.

1110
01:45:50,861 --> 01:45:53,728
None of these things
can be written down, Robin.

1111
01:45:53,797 --> 01:45:56,561
You must commit them
to your very soul.

1112
01:45:57,301 --> 01:45:59,166
This is the science of memory.

1113
01:45:59,637 --> 01:46:05,041
"Rise and rise again
until lambs become lions."

1114
01:46:07,478 --> 01:46:12,711
Finally, hundreds listened, thousands,
who took up his call

1115
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:16,215
<i>for the rights of all ranks
from baron to serf.</i>

1116
01:46:19,189 --> 01:46:20,850
"Rise and rise again

1117
01:46:23,093 --> 01:46:25,323
"until lambs become lions."

1118
01:46:30,434 --> 01:46:32,265
What happened to him?

1119
01:46:33,103 --> 01:46:34,798
Close your eyes.

1120
01:46:41,011 --> 01:46:45,243
<i>... foundation is set
on the rights of liberty for all people!</i>

1121
01:46:49,887 --> 01:46:53,288
Longstride, give up the charter
and their names!

1122
01:46:53,524 --> 01:46:55,048
<i>You were there.</i>

1123
01:46:55,359 --> 01:46:56,621
You saw it.

1124
01:46:59,863 --> 01:47:01,296
I will not.

1125
01:47:25,489 --> 01:47:26,854
Not dead.

1126
01:47:28,325 --> 01:47:29,622
Not now.

1127
01:47:32,496 --> 01:47:33,724
Not now.

1128
01:47:38,102 --> 01:47:41,799
Here is my copy
of the main contract.

1129
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:45,733
This charter of rights
was written by your father.

1130
01:47:45,809 --> 01:47:49,836
And here are... There are the names
of all the barons that signed the charter.

1131
01:47:49,913 --> 01:47:53,314
Fitzrobert, Baldwin, Marshal and myself.

1132
01:47:53,851 --> 01:47:57,150
What he wanted
was a charter for every man...

1133
01:47:57,221 --> 01:47:59,781
- Wait there.
- to have the same rights.

1134
01:47:59,857 --> 01:48:02,985
Sir Walter?
A messenger for you.

1135
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:04,584
Bring him in.

1136
01:48:05,295 --> 01:48:07,024
Step forward, sir.

1137
01:48:08,098 --> 01:48:10,589
- My Lord.
- I'm listening.

1138
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,998
Peterborough's been burned
by the King's men.

1139
01:48:13,537 --> 01:48:16,370
Fitzrobert gathers an army
to slay King John in London.

1140
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:19,932
Marshal requests your presence
at counsel in Barnsdale.

1141
01:48:21,645 --> 01:48:23,943
Wait outside, will you?

1142
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:27,683
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

1143
01:48:28,852 --> 01:48:31,548
The time for pretense is over.

1144
01:48:32,856 --> 01:48:35,552
Now, hold me like a son.

1145
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,024
Go.

1146
01:48:45,602 --> 01:48:48,537
Maggie.
Where's my lady?

1147
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:50,106
I could not find her, sir.

1148
01:49:16,166 --> 01:49:21,001
Whether we fight for our lives,
our family and our honor,

1149
01:49:21,071 --> 01:49:22,834
we must fight till the death.

1150
01:49:23,841 --> 01:49:26,674
You've spent too long
in the palace, William.

1151
01:49:26,777 --> 01:49:30,110
Spending time in the palace
gives me perspective.

1152
01:49:31,248 --> 01:49:32,909
As we speak,

1153
01:49:33,984 --> 01:49:36,748
King Philip sails for our coast.

1154
01:49:37,788 --> 01:49:42,282
Godfrey and his marauders are French!

1155
01:49:43,961 --> 01:49:46,862
Every minute that we waste in disunity

1156
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:50,161
brings closer the destruction
of our country!

1157
01:49:50,634 --> 01:49:52,499
We have been bled

1158
01:49:53,136 --> 01:49:54,933
by the King long before Godfrey.

1159
01:49:56,106 --> 01:49:58,904
Go back to London and tell the King

1160
01:49:59,610 --> 01:50:03,376
that we will meet him
on a field of his choice.

1161
01:50:03,447 --> 01:50:04,812
Make way!

1162
01:50:04,882 --> 01:50:07,180
We will not fight
to save John's crown.

1163
01:50:08,218 --> 01:50:10,482
Rather let him bend the knee to us.

1164
01:50:11,555 --> 01:50:13,921
I'll give you more, Sir Baldwin.

1165
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:17,691
My breast for your sword point.

1166
01:50:19,429 --> 01:50:20,987
Use mine.

1167
01:50:25,135 --> 01:50:26,329
Go on.

1168
01:50:27,738 --> 01:50:29,069
No?

1169
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:33,398
Oh, this is what you want, isn't it?
This is what he wants.

1170
01:50:33,477 --> 01:50:37,436
Fine, I'd rather give it to you
than have it taken by the French.

1171
01:50:38,415 --> 01:50:40,679
You mistake me, Sire.

1172
01:50:40,851 --> 01:50:44,719
I have no right and no ambition
to wear the crown.

1173
01:50:45,355 --> 01:50:47,846
But let the rightful wearer beware.

1174
01:50:48,292 --> 01:50:52,388
From now we will be subject only to laws
that we have a hand in making.

1175
01:50:52,462 --> 01:50:57,195
We are not sheep
to be made mutton of by your butchers.

1176
01:50:59,002 --> 01:51:02,665
Godfrey set himself to turn you against me.

1177
01:51:02,739 --> 01:51:05,902
Then he did more than was needed
to accomplish that.

1178
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,641
A very important decision.

1179
01:51:13,483 --> 01:51:17,078
Don't you think that we've paid
too much taxes for far too long...

1180
01:52:25,022 --> 01:52:26,853
This is where I was born.

1181
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:44,440
- What does it mean?
- It means never give up.

1182
01:52:45,909 --> 01:52:50,403
We will not be loyal to a crown
that robs and starves us!

1183
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:53,981
The King must listen
to what we have to say!

1184
01:52:54,084 --> 01:52:58,851
A king does not bargain for the loyalty
that every subject owes him.

1185
01:52:59,122 --> 01:53:03,650
Without loyalty there is no kingdom.
There is nothing.

1186
01:53:05,128 --> 01:53:07,289
I'm here to speak
for Sir Walter Loxley.

1187
01:53:09,332 --> 01:53:11,527
- Let the man speak.
- Let him speak!

1188
01:53:12,636 --> 01:53:14,467
Speak! Speak!

1189
01:53:14,671 --> 01:53:16,832
Speak, if you must.

1190
01:53:18,475 --> 01:53:21,239
If you're trying to build for the future,

1191
01:53:21,945 --> 01:53:24,470
you must set your foundation strong.

1192
01:53:26,283 --> 01:53:30,743
The laws of this land
enslave people to its king,

1193
01:53:32,422 --> 01:53:36,688
a king who demands loyalty
but offers nothing in return.

1194
01:53:38,261 --> 01:53:41,128
I have marched from France

1195
01:53:41,198 --> 01:53:43,723
to Palestine and back.

1196
01:53:44,701 --> 01:53:46,100
And I know

1197
01:53:46,737 --> 01:53:49,865
in tyranny lies only failure.

1198
01:53:51,475 --> 01:53:54,000
You build a country
like you build a cathedral,

1199
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:55,271
from the ground up.

1200
01:53:56,446 --> 01:53:58,573
Empower every man

1201
01:53:59,816 --> 01:54:01,716
and you will gain strength.

1202
01:54:01,785 --> 01:54:03,514
Hmm.

1203
01:54:03,587 --> 01:54:06,681
Well, who could object
to such reasonable words?

1204
01:54:09,126 --> 01:54:12,789
If Your Majesty were to offer justice,

1205
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:16,498
justice in the form
of a charter of liberties,

1206
01:54:17,067 --> 01:54:20,798
allowing every man to forage for his hearth,

1207
01:54:21,471 --> 01:54:25,305
to be safe from conviction without cause

1208
01:54:25,375 --> 01:54:27,104
or prison without charge,

1209
01:54:27,844 --> 01:54:32,110
to work, eat and live
on the sweat of his own brow

1210
01:54:33,016 --> 01:54:36,452
- and be as merry as he can...
- Sir, Godfrey's men are on to Nottingham.

1211
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:39,621
then that king would be great.

1212
01:54:40,123 --> 01:54:43,957
Not only would he receive
the loyalty of his people

1213
01:54:45,262 --> 01:54:47,059
but their love, as well.

1214
01:54:48,365 --> 01:54:50,890
So what would you have? Hmm?

1215
01:54:51,101 --> 01:54:52,864
Castle for every man?

1216
01:54:55,205 --> 01:54:57,332
Every Englishman's home is his castle.

1217
01:54:58,775 --> 01:55:01,539
What we would ask, Your Majesty,

1218
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:04,446
is liberty.

1219
01:55:04,781 --> 01:55:06,908
Liberty by law!

1220
01:55:08,852 --> 01:55:11,218
Your Majesty, My Lords,

1221
01:55:11,922 --> 01:55:14,482
the French fleet is in the Channel.

1222
01:55:14,658 --> 01:55:19,652
Sire, you have a chance
to unify your subjects high and low.

1223
01:55:21,364 --> 01:55:23,355
It falls on your nod.

1224
01:55:23,834 --> 01:55:25,802
I only have to nod?

1225
01:55:29,873 --> 01:55:31,670
I can do better than that.

1226
01:55:34,077 --> 01:55:35,874
I give my word

1227
01:55:36,379 --> 01:55:39,507
that such a charter will be written.

1228
01:55:39,583 --> 01:55:42,984
On my mother's life, I swear it.

1229
01:55:48,024 --> 01:55:51,425
Godfrey makes for Nottingham.
I must stay with the King.

1230
01:55:51,494 --> 01:55:53,553
I will send Baldwin and Fitzrobert with you.

1231
01:55:53,630 --> 01:55:57,430
We will meet again at the White Horse
when you are finished.

1232
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:00,526
Robin, your father was a great man.

1233
01:56:01,838 --> 01:56:04,102
And you are your father's son.

1234
01:56:15,051 --> 01:56:16,575
Maggie, who's at the house?

1235
01:56:18,255 --> 01:56:19,483
Long live the King!

1236
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:56,851
Gentlemen.

1237
01:57:11,574 --> 01:57:13,667
I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham.

1238
01:57:18,748 --> 01:57:20,648
I'm French on my mother's side.

1239
01:57:41,838 --> 01:57:44,739
Sir Walter! Sir Walter!

1240
01:57:52,916 --> 01:57:54,213
Loxley!

1241
01:57:54,451 --> 01:57:56,112
Show yourself!

1242
01:57:58,254 --> 01:57:59,516
Loxley!

1243
01:58:02,492 --> 01:58:03,925
Who calls here?

1244
01:58:04,427 --> 01:58:06,395
I call for Robert Loxley.

1245
01:58:06,629 --> 01:58:08,597
My son is not here to answer you.

1246
01:58:08,698 --> 01:58:10,165
That is the truth.

1247
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:12,231
Because he's dead in a French ditch.

1248
01:58:14,371 --> 01:58:15,895
And who are you, sir,
to say so?

1249
01:58:17,607 --> 01:58:19,131
Who am I?

1250
01:58:27,751 --> 01:58:29,616
I'm the one who killed him.

1251
01:58:31,421 --> 01:58:33,150
Fight me if you dare.

1252
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:35,457
Lord have mercy.

1253
01:59:23,907 --> 01:59:25,932
Leave it on the table.
Leave it! Next!

1254
01:59:26,910 --> 01:59:28,571
Next! Come on!

1255
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:32,075
- Name?
- Loxley.

1256
01:59:32,515 --> 01:59:34,107
Christian name?

1257
01:59:34,384 --> 01:59:35,817
Marion.

1258
01:59:36,653 --> 01:59:38,348
Land?

1259
01:59:38,521 --> 01:59:40,284
5,000 acres.

1260
01:59:41,324 --> 01:59:43,053
Lady Marion Loxley?

1261
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:45,352
I am.

1262
02:00:14,557 --> 02:00:17,617
Gentlemen, enjoy!

1263
02:00:51,094 --> 02:00:53,153
No one should have 4,000 acres.

1264
02:00:53,229 --> 02:00:55,254
5,000 acres.

1265
02:02:33,496 --> 02:02:35,521
Baldwin! Fitzrobert!

1266
02:02:35,598 --> 02:02:38,192
Take the southern flank
and circle in from the west.

1267
02:02:38,701 --> 02:02:41,431
Will and Allan, get on the rooftops
and pick your targets.

1268
02:03:02,659 --> 02:03:04,058
Lady Marion.

1269
02:03:25,548 --> 02:03:26,606
Quickly.

1270
02:03:52,975 --> 02:03:54,442
Follow me.

1271
02:04:16,366 --> 02:04:20,632
Somebody, please take the baby!
Save the baby, please!

1272
02:04:30,046 --> 02:04:31,673
John, down!

1273
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:39,114
It's all right.

1274
02:04:39,188 --> 02:04:40,348
Go around.

1275
02:04:40,423 --> 02:04:41,685
Stand back!

1276
02:04:43,493 --> 02:04:44,551
Make way!

1277
02:04:45,661 --> 02:04:49,791
Hurry. It's all right. It's all right.
Please, hurry! Hurry!

1278
02:05:01,477 --> 02:05:02,569
Sword!

1279
02:05:22,365 --> 02:05:24,424
Get down,
you bastard French dogs!

1280
02:06:14,684 --> 02:06:17,949
Where will King Philip land and when?

1281
02:06:31,801 --> 02:06:33,769
This is my last arrow.

1282
02:06:35,638 --> 02:06:39,301
Dungeness! Dungeness.
Two days.

1283
02:06:43,312 --> 02:06:45,837
There we have it.
We have two days.

1284
02:08:12,501 --> 02:08:15,732
Once before I said goodbye
to a man going to war.

1285
02:08:16,038 --> 02:08:17,835
He never came back.

1286
02:08:23,746 --> 02:08:25,475
Ask me nicely.

1287
02:09:00,182 --> 02:09:01,649
I love you, Marion.

1288
02:11:26,328 --> 02:11:27,852
Longstride!

1289
02:11:58,794 --> 02:12:00,955
What news of Walter and Nottingham?

1290
02:12:01,897 --> 02:12:04,491
Sir Walter is dead.
Godfrey's hand.

1291
02:12:04,567 --> 02:12:07,297
Gentlemen, we go to war.

1292
02:12:07,536 --> 02:12:11,063
It is my first time.
I shall lead.

1293
02:12:11,140 --> 02:12:12,368
Forward!

1294
02:13:52,474 --> 02:13:54,237
That's a lot of French.

1295
02:13:56,478 --> 02:13:58,070
What's to be done?

1296
02:13:59,481 --> 02:14:01,039
Archers to the cliff top.

1297
02:14:01,617 --> 02:14:04,245
Cavalry to the beach.
We'll await you there.

1298
02:14:04,653 --> 02:14:06,780
- With me!
- Archers!

1299
02:14:09,258 --> 02:14:11,055
Excellent plan.

1300
02:14:32,748 --> 02:14:33,942
Cavalry!

1301
02:14:46,195 --> 02:14:47,628
Ready!

1302
02:15:07,249 --> 02:15:09,979
- Raise arrows!
- Raise arrows!

1303
02:15:11,053 --> 02:15:12,111
Ready!

1304
02:15:15,824 --> 02:15:17,724
Raise arrows!

1305
02:15:18,127 --> 02:15:19,992
Release! Release!

1306
02:15:32,541 --> 02:15:33,599
Release!

1307
02:16:10,712 --> 02:16:11,940
For the love of God, Marion!

1308
02:16:16,318 --> 02:16:17,649
Loxley,

1309
02:16:17,986 --> 02:16:20,921
circle your troops
and then join the charge.

1310
02:16:26,061 --> 02:16:27,153
With me!

1311
02:16:32,067 --> 02:16:33,364
Release!

1312
02:16:44,379 --> 02:16:45,437
Release!

1313
02:17:33,028 --> 02:17:35,223
Forward!

1314
02:17:53,215 --> 02:17:54,807
Archers, forward!

1315
02:18:21,877 --> 02:18:23,674
Let's go, Marshal.

1316
02:18:23,745 --> 02:18:25,235
We're close enough, Sire.

1317
02:18:25,914 --> 02:18:27,745
This was not close enough for Richard.

1318
02:18:27,816 --> 02:18:29,681
And look what happened to him.

1319
02:18:30,719 --> 02:18:32,152
Forward!

1320
02:18:32,654 --> 02:18:34,178
Protect the King!

1321
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:07,217
This is for you, Walter.

1322
02:19:20,335 --> 02:19:23,327
No!

1323
02:19:30,612 --> 02:19:31,874
Marion!

1324
02:21:15,283 --> 02:21:16,716
Marion!

1325
02:21:44,246 --> 02:21:45,474
Surrender!

1326
02:22:08,437 --> 02:22:10,598
Sire! Sire!

1327
02:22:10,739 --> 02:22:12,798
They've surrendered, Sire!

1328
02:22:13,175 --> 02:22:15,302
Yes! To whom?

1329
02:22:19,347 --> 02:22:20,371
To him.

1330
02:22:20,449 --> 02:22:22,349
Longstride!

1331
02:22:24,019 --> 02:22:25,748
Longstride!

1332
02:22:33,795 --> 02:22:36,059
Longstride!

1333
02:22:37,165 --> 02:22:38,996
Longstride!

1334
02:23:16,905 --> 02:23:19,499
I did not make myself king.

1335
02:23:21,943 --> 02:23:23,342
God did.

1336
02:23:24,212 --> 02:23:26,237
King by divine right.

1337
02:23:27,516 --> 02:23:30,781
Now you come to me
with this document

1338
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:36,188
seeking to limit the authority
given to me by God!

1339
02:23:36,258 --> 02:23:38,783
Sire, you gave your word!

1340
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:39,918
No.

1341
02:23:39,995 --> 02:23:43,897
- Sire, you give us our word, Sire!
- Did I command you to speak, sir?

1342
02:23:44,132 --> 02:23:46,430
- John...
- Or you, madam?

1343
02:23:46,501 --> 02:23:48,594
Sire, we looked to you!

1344
02:23:48,670 --> 02:23:51,901
Look to your estates, instead.

1345
02:23:54,943 --> 02:23:56,342
Archers!

1346
02:23:56,945 --> 02:24:00,073
You are fortunate
that I am in a merciful mood.

1347
02:24:01,249 --> 02:24:05,652
But as for Robin Longstride,
that mason's son,

1348
02:24:06,821 --> 02:24:11,155
for the crimes of theft
and incitement to cause unrest,

1349
02:24:11,226 --> 02:24:15,526
who pretended to be a knight of the realm,
a crime punishable by death,

1350
02:24:15,597 --> 02:24:20,534
I declare him, from this day forth,
to be an outlaw!

1351
02:24:22,437 --> 02:24:26,066
To be hunted all the days
of his life...

1352
02:24:26,174 --> 02:24:30,201
- We will not stand for this!
- until his corpse, unburied, is carrion

1353
02:24:30,278 --> 02:24:33,008
for foxes and crows!

1354
02:24:56,071 --> 02:24:58,005
Hear me! Hear me!

1355
02:25:01,009 --> 02:25:02,704
By royal decree,

1356
02:25:03,278 --> 02:25:06,770
Robin Longstride,
also known as Robin of the Hood,

1357
02:25:07,082 --> 02:25:10,176
and all who shelter him or aid him

1358
02:25:10,251 --> 02:25:11,946
are declared outlaws of the realm,

1359
02:25:13,088 --> 02:25:14,783
their properties forfeit,

1360
02:25:14,856 --> 02:25:19,020
and their lives shall be taken
by any Englishman on sight.

1361
02:25:24,966 --> 02:25:27,662
A nail please?
And a hammer.

1362
02:25:28,403 --> 02:25:29,631
A nail!

1363
02:26:20,622 --> 02:26:22,886
Off you go.
Come on.

1364
02:26:23,825 --> 02:26:24,985
Hey, boys.

1365
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:27,028
- You've been practicing tying your knots?
- Yes.

1366
02:26:27,095 --> 02:26:28,926
Have you been shooting
your bow and arrows?

1367
02:26:28,997 --> 02:26:30,589
Who hit something?
Anyone?

1368
02:26:30,665 --> 02:26:33,498
<i>The greenwood is the outlaw's friend.</i>

1369
02:26:33,601 --> 02:26:36,331
<i>Now, the orphan boys
make us welcome.</i>

1370
02:26:37,238 --> 02:26:38,637
<i>No tax, no tithe.</i>

1371
02:26:38,707 --> 02:26:43,144
<i>Nobody rich, nobody poor.
Fair shares for all at nature's table.</i>

1372
02:26:43,445 --> 02:26:47,575
<i>Many wrongs to be righted
in the country of King John.</i>

1373
02:26:50,919 --> 02:26:53,080
<i>Watch over us, Walter.</i>

1374
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:54,090
<i>For the Lion Heart!</i>

1375
02:29:55,305 --> 02:30:55,909
