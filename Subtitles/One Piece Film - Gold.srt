GREAT!

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,180
Nami, is this ship is the right place?

7
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,460
Yes, the world's largest entertainment city.

8
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,960
and the only one in the whole world.

9
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,750
Gran Tesoro!

10
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,590
Eh, it's not an island huh?

11
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,130
All of it ...

12
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,540
Let's go to the casino!

13
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,170
Yeah!

14
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,130
Ah, what is that shining thing?

15
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,840
This....

16
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,270
Gold powder?

17
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,750
I-It's real gold.

18
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,590
Guys, quickly grab as much as possible!

19
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,790
Everything becomes golden colour! Gold!

20
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,190
Super!

21
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,840
Even the water is become gold.

22
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,260
Interesting too, yes.

23
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,380
Faster! Franky!

24
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,960
Leave it to me!

25
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,210
Coup de Burst!

26
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,350
Advanced!

27
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,300
GREAT!

28
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,290
Meroline!

29
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,250
What is this?

30
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,180
Great!

31
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,160
Who are they?

32
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,390
What the hell?

33
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:57,230
We are the long-long pirate! Hand over your valuable things!

34
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,250
We have never lost in seizing the money!

35
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,500
Hah? What's that?

36
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,340
Take this!

37
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,460
We're been fire!

38
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,000
What?

39
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,750
Tesoro-sama!

40
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,870
There are pirates who outrage us!

41
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,500
No problem.

42
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,460
Might as well be used as entertainment only.

43
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,170
That...?

44
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:29,160
Yes. It seems they are the Straw Hat Pirates.

45
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,830
Straw Hat Pirates?

46
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,460
Well, well.

47
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,120
It will be interesting.

48
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,670
What? What?

49
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,390
Submit, your valuables!

50
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,370
Geez, how dare you interrupt my sleep.

51
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,370
I do not know who you are ...

52
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,920
but if I had pulled my sword, be prepared!

53
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,340
Of course!

54
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,040
Santoryuu

55
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,710
Onigiri!

56
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,500
Hoi, Hoi ...

57
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,870
This drink could be spilled.

58
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,710
What?

59
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,350
Annoying!

60
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,790
Robin-cwaan!

61
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,290
Sorry!

62
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,330
Thank you, Sanji.

63
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,040
Stop!

64
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,310
Girl, where's your money ?!

65
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,000
Let me tell you the good news.

66
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,040
We do not have any money.

67
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,670
Your meat and bone

68
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,920
was cut!

69
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,380
Although I had not had meat, anyway.

70
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,040
Keep shooting!

71
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,250
Radical Beam

72
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,540
It's still not okay!

73
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,370
Forward, if you dare!

74
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,790
Got you!

75
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,460
Usopp!

76
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,250
Are you alright? Hold on!

77
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,370
Shit!

78
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,790
I remember. They are ...

79
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,910
Hey ...

80
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,710
Long head!

81
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,790
What are ...

82
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,870

83
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,330
... to Sunny ?!

84
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,290
Long head?

85
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,330
I would...

86
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,870
make you shut up!

87
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,540
Pirate captain long-long!

88
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,960
Alexander Alex Kent Paul Harris

89
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,870
Hendrix Howard Rudolph Eccentrix

90
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,080
Not effective!

91
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,830
What?

92
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,290
Because I'm made from rubber!

93
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,790
Gomu-Gomu no

94
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,320
Jet

95
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,120
Wait, not yet --

96
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,000
Pistol!

97
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,160
The captain had been defeated!

98
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,000
Run!

99
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,250
What's wrong?

100
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,370
What is that?

101
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,910
Great!

102
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,960
Gold Sprash!

103
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,490
The entertainment city in the world!

104
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,990
Welcome to the Gran Tesoro!

105
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,380
Extraordinary!

106
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,310
The place is interesting!

107
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,170
Masterful!

108
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,410
This city is great!

109
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,530
Wow. Amazing!

110
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,070
You Straw Hat Pirates, right?

111
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,210
Greetings.

112
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,950
Hello, pretty lady.

113
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,990
I was the chef at our ship, Sanji.

114
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,950
It was very lucky to be met by a woman as beautiful as you.

115
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,280
Well, you philandering yes, I got goosebumps lo.

116
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,780
I serve VIP guests, my name Baccarat.

117
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,120
Do you know us?

118
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,280
Of course.

119
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,370
All the pirates were chased by the Navy and the Government.

120
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,410
Everything is recorded in this VIP's book.

121
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,380
Isn't it?

122
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,200
Looks like we're famous, yes.

123
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,410
Yes. If you need anything, just tell me.

124
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,240

Tortoise!

126
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,240
Great. What is this?

127
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,410

128
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:57,220
Yes. This is a car turtles. One of transportation here.

129
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,200
Great. Turtles as the engine huh?

130
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,020
Yes. This car is running on eight golden turtles.

131
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,030
Tortoise.

132
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,200

133
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,820

134
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,950

Sake is also there.

138
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,740
Is there any cola?

139
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,820
Yosh, let's go!

140
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,240
Good. Let's go to the town of Gran Tesoro.

141
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,820
Depart!

142
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,150
Tortoise!

143
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,240
This car is a comfortable one, huh.

144
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:49,330
Yes. This car is made with emphasis on passenger's comfort.

145
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,740
OK. The first is the business area.

146
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,160
Like the dream state, yes.

147
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,530
No, no ...

148
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,190
This is just half of it.

149
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,700
The overall length of the ship is 10 kilometers.

150
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,240
10 kilometer?

151
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,200
Ya.

152
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,990
There are hotels, shopping malls, and of course there is the amusement park and swimming pool.

153
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,240
Even theater and a golf course was also there.

154
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,320
The big ship is the same as one country.

155
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,240
This place even has been officially recognized by the Government and the world.

156
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,160
This ship is powered by a giant turtle,

157
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,820
so as to surround the entire world.

158
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,260
Next is the first-class area.

159
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,240
Masterful.

160
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,980
The town is made of gold, huh.

161
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,120
Yes. King in Gran Tesoro, Tesoro-sama,

162
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,160
very fond of gold.

163
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,950
Gold in worldwide.

164
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,500
The city also included the city of his dreams.

165
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,870
Great. His money is certainly a great deal huh?

166
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,410
Yes. Tesoro-together has been recognized as the richest man in the world.

167
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,820
He is well-known performers, and highly respected.

168
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,320
In addition, he also served as King.

169
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,820
So fantastic! (Remarkable)

170
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,950
Hey. All the goods here is very valuable, right?

171
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,660
I think so, I wish I could steal it from the beginning.

172
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,120
Unfortunately, it can not.

173
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,820
Look over there!

174
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,270
Denden Mushi CCTV ...

175
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,360
Correct. In every corner of the city is already installed CCTV.

176
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,870
If there is a thief or a group of rebels ...

177
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,280
according to city regulations, they have been indicted.

178
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,370
Detained underground.

179
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,380
Hey. Hurry to the Casino, Casino!

180
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,030
Of course, but ...

181
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,910
Before that...

182
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,530
You all deserve to wear that attire.

183
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,740
Hey, can we really wear this?

184
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,200
Yes of course, because you are a VIP guest.

185
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,240
Here is a gambling town. You are free as long that you pay.

186
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,280
Hm hm, that's right yeah.

187
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,110
Wait, you do not know anything, right?

188
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,950
What if we lose?

189
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,240
Anyway it's good!

190
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,740
Hear me talk!

191
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,320
This casino, huh?

192
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,030
Correct. Gran Tesoro's pride.

193
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,530
The largest hotel in the world.

194
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,820
The Reoro!

195
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,360
Great. All are from gold!

196
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,070
Everything is made of pure gold.

197
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,950
Weeh. What the hell are you doing?

198
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,900
Buy yourself flowers.

199
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,650
Please.

200
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,860
These guys VIP's guests, right?

201
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,280
What?

202
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,780
Please, buy this flower ...

203
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,200
Come on, buy, have mercy on us is ...

204
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,610
Yes, Yes ...

205
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,240
How much it costs?

206
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,490
5000 berry.

207
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,610
That's expensive!

208
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,740
If you do not have money, we will not be able to be free!

209
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,530
Hey, I'm begging you, do you?

210
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,490
What does it mean?

211
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,530
Well, well. Children...

212
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,150
Why are you disturbing my guests?

213
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,860
Here is not the place for a child like you.

214
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,950
Quick, go home.

215
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,320
Sister.

216
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,900
Sorry. Let's go!

217
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,860
Wait.

218
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,740
Huh? Hey...

219
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,820
Sorry for the interruption.

220
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,450
Then, let's continue the journey.

221
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,740
Tonight, your voice is very beautiful, huh, Carina.

222
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,320
Good work.

223
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,900
Tesoro-sama were still far superior.

224
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,950
Tesoro-sama.

225
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,070
Baccarat has managed to convince the Straw Hat Pirates.

226
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,860
Oh, I see?

227
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,780
The man who beat Doflamingo is very troublesome.

228
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,450
Then we'll see what they can bring something for me?

229
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,070
Ohh, that name ...

230
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,990
I've heard about it.

231
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,700
"I will be the Pirate King" is a silly word.

232
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,110
Right?

233
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,240
You're drunk.

234
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,740
Yes, yes.

235
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,030
Hey.

236
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,360
Can I ask one thing?

237
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,990
Why are you laughing in front of me?

238
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,240
I do not...

239
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,700
Who decide that you can laugh in this town ...

240
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,070
Who is he?

241
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,110
I-It was ... of course you, Tesoro-sama.

242
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,690
No!

243
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,900
Tesoro-sama, please forgive me.

244
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,480
I will never laugh again.

245
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,980
So? You already understand, yes.

246
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,820
Then that's good.

247
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,690
Please!

248
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,030
Look! She squirms!

249
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,230
That's an entertainment!

250
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,480
What will we do with them, Straw Hat Pirates?

251
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,570
I wonder how? Complete with money alone.

252
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,820
OK.

253
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,730
It will definitely be a very interesting show.

254
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,650
So this is a casino, huh?

255
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,570
It's really big, huh?

256
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,070
Yes. There are many types of games here.

257
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,780
If anyone you do not understand, please ask me alone.

258
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,480
I'll show you the way.

259
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,480
Forgive me.

260
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,320
Anyway, we lend 200 million berry chips first.

261
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,820
200 million?

262
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,400
Can we really wear this?

263
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,190
Certainly. Do not hesitate.

264
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,320
Thanks. I play first!

265
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,780
Luffy!

266
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,440
We also!

267
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,230
Wait!

268
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,400
Come on!

269
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,900
Ya!

270
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,400
Wait a minute!

271
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,070
Geez, their own wishes!

272
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,440
What is this game?

273
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,280
Yes. Here is a turtle car racing game.

274
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,190
Racing?

275
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,780
Correct. 100 million berries for this game registration's fee.

276
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,230
100 million berry?

277
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,320
OK. I will explain the rules of the race of turtle cars!

278
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,650
Hotshell!

279
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,770
You guys, watch it if you lose!

280
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,320
Leave it to us!

281
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,440
We must win!

282
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,650
There are 6 participants' cars.

283
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,900
You can invade and disrupt the opponent.

284
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,650
Anyway, whoever got here first is the winner!

285
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,030
The race lasts for 10 rounds.

286
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,400
Well, we start.

287
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,860
Ready to go!

288
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,780
The race begins!

289
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,610
Well, who first led the ...

290
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,820
Oh, that lead is Jimmy Myers!

291
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,650
Hey, move over!

292
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,360
What the hell?

293
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,360
Ah, Jimmy has been eliminated ...

294
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,360
And the lead now is ...

295
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,240
Advanced!

296
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,150
He continues to go forward without giving up.

297
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,940
Straight warrior!

298
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,820
Sir!

299
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,820
Dead end, we must turn to the other directions!

300
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,190
Do not inconsequential!

301
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,820
In my dictionary, there is no term revolving direction!

302
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,440
Nice, Sir!

303
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,820
Ah! Off the track!

304
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,730
The remaining 4 cars!

305
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,730
Oh, now that is pursuing is

306
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,820
Straw Hat, Luffy!

307
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,440
The first position is occupied by Whitejack!

308
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,820
I will not let you race!

309
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,030
Kiruko-chan!

310
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,650
OK!

311
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,320
Look out!

312
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,530
Oh no!

313
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,820
Ah, they are slipping!

314
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,610
And here they go!

315
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,110
Hurry, Usopp!

316
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,360
I know!

317
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,280
The first position is occupied by Whitejack.

318
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,780
And 3 other cars continue to pursue.

319
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,480
Whitejack has been off the track!

320
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,860
The great strength of Kent Beef Jr.

321
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,570
Uh oh!

322
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,150
Team Count successful in racing!

323
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,150
This is bad!

324
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,230
Damn!

325
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,980
What?!

326
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,070
Come on!

327
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,030
Kill them, Pork!

328
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,070
There is sharp lap in front of them!

329
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,070
Will they pass through it?

330
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,690
Ah! Off the track!

331
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,070
Oh, nice shot!

332
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,650
Gomu-Gomu no

333
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,860
Rocket!

334
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,740
Come on!

335
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,400
Marry me!

336
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,280
It's them!

337
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,190
Ah, what happened?

338
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,900
Luffy!

339
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,150
Straw Hat's team back again!

340
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,070
Impossible!

341
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,820
That sounds good.

342
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,570
Come on!

343
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,570
The last round!

344
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,240
They were racing each other!

345
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,030
Who will be the winner?

346
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,740
Come on!

347
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,360
The winner is the team of the Straw Hats!

348
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,860
Yosh, we gain great money!

349
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,940
Yosha!

350
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,940
Great!

351
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,150
A lot!

352
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,650
Huh?

353
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,820
Win again ?!

354
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,820
Yosh, very good!

355
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,320
Cool!

356
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,570
Great.

357
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,940
We immediately got a 30 million berry.

358
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,860
Great.

359
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,360
You guys are great.

360
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,780
Then, we must immediately go to the VIP room.

361
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,900
What's that?

362
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,070
Only the winners can enter.

363
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,030
If you win a special gambling there, you can become a billionaire.

364
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,440
Want to try it?

365
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,190
How?

366
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,900
Of course. We're going to win.

367
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,990
That's great! (That is good)

368
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,530
I can't wait.

369
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,190
Are we there yet?

370
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,190
Wait a minute.

371
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,740
What is that creature?

372
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,610
He set up all game here, Tanaka-san.

373
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,190
Welcome.

374
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,650
He Nuke Nuke devil fruit eaters.

375
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,320
He can penetrate any object.

376
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,690
Guests, please sign in.

377
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,940
Great, right in!

378
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,360
Is this the VIP?

379
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,070
What the hell is this place?

380
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,440
Eh, gambling specifically placed here huh.

381
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,360
Yes.

382
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,320
Hey, Hey.

383
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,740
Navy is also here?

384
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,740
Really! Bad!

385
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,570
Take it easy.

386
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,240
Gran Tesoro is the place that has been officially recognized by the government and the world.

387
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,980
Navy is forbidden to touch a pirate.

388
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,270
That's our rule.

389
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,360
Apparently so.

390
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,730
Ready.

391
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,320
Then let us begin.

392
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,940
Who is he?

393
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,360
He is Dice.

394
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,770
Unbeaten fighters in the underworld.

395
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,820
He is the underworld champion.

396
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,270
Because there was no one dared to fight him,

397
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,070
now he works here.

398
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,940
Yess!

399
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,570
Great strength!

400
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,900
That axe was nice as well, huh.

401
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,150
Be prepared!

402
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,690
He flew!

403
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,400
Wadaw!

404
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,480
Yeash!

405
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,980
What is he doing with his axe?!!

406
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,320
The joy!

407
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,980
2 and 6 odd!

408
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,940
How? Interesting right?

409
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,110
I do not know what he is doing.

410
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,690
Alright guys, the present coins of the game is $ 300 million berry.

411
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,480
300 million!

412
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,270
It's a chance we become billionaire.

413
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,110
Just do it!

414
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,690
This place that really makes me shocked!

415
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,570
Good! Bet it all!

416
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,860
Wait, woi!

417
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,110
Yeah!

418
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,480
The joy!

419
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,690
1 odd!

420
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,270
Yosh!

421
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,770
Masterful!

422
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,320
Steady, steady!

423
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,150
Luffy-sama is great.

424
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,150
You're so lucky.

425
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,820
We certainly can! We could really rich ...

426
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,440
Truly...

427
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,900
Just normal!

428
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,320
Tesoro-sama!

429
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,820
It Tesoro-sama!

430
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,820
Well, well.

431
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,360
Welcome to the Gran Tesoro.

432
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,610
You guys having fun?

433
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,900
Who are you?

434
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,400
Yes, yes. Nice to meet you.

435
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,570
I am the King of this vessel.

436
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,360
My name Gild Tesoro.

437
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,110
So you're being called the King of entertainment, huh?

438
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,940
I am a person who will become the Pirate King!

439
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,860
Why did you even show off ?!

440
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,070
Able to meet the future Pirate King,

441
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,150
really gives me the creeps.

442
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,020
Oh yes...

443
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,320
Why don't you play against me?

444
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,520
Play?

445
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,980
It's a great opportunity.

446
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,690
These are the rules.

447
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,900
If you win against me,

448
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,100
I would pay 10 times as much.

449
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,440
10 times?

450
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,190
Of course if you lose, you don't have to pay 10 times.

451
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,310
I have a lot of money and they are not inexhaustible.

452
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,770
I think such regulations very exciting.

453
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,390
Well, how?

454
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,520
Alright, I will not lose!

455
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,980
Hey, was this okay ?!

456
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,140
Now this is a great opportunity.

457
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,770
I believe with Luffy's luck!

458
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,730
Yosh, I have decided!

459
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,020
Bet it all!

460
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,140
Luffy-sama is great.

461
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,640
Risking it all are really great.

462
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,980
Luffy, wait!

463
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,980
I will support you.

464
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,310
Let's play!

465
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,770
Hey, how?

466
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,690
Yeesh!

467
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,980
I lose.

468
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,190
Impossible.

469
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,060
Luffy lost?

470
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,980
Well. Good work.

471
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,440
It's really great shows, Baccarat.

472
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,690
Shows? What does it mean?

473
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,270
You devil fruit eaters, right?

474
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:28,940
Eh?

475
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,770
Yes. Correct.

476
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,310
I'm Raki Raki devil fruit eater.

477
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:36,890
I could change the fortunes of man into misfortune.

478
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,390
Misfortune?

479
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,060
So, Luffy ...

480
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,480
So I'm being unlucky now?

481
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,440
Ya.

482
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,390
But I do not feel anything.

483
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,190
What is this?

484
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,600
My stomach hurts!

485
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,520
Impossible!

486
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,730
Luffy could had abdominal pain ?!

487
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,560
Banana peel?!

488
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,520
Raki Raki fruit is creepy!

489
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,440
Is this not cheating?

490
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,940
Cheating?

491
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,890
Let me tell you one thing.

492
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,350
This is a city ordinance

493
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,560
people who have been deceived here

494
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,600
just a loser.

495
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,640
We have been deceived!

496
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,440
Then, money lending totaling 3 x 20 million berry that ...

497
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,060
Will you give it back?

498
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,020
Can you afford that much?

499
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,940
You should work to restore the money, really.

500
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,980
Work?

501
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,140
People who work in this town

502
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,440
are the people who owe me because they lost in games.

503
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:00,980
If you refuse, we have no other choice but to act harshly!

504
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,610
Interesting too.

505
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,730
Try it if you dare!

506
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,110
Ouch.

507
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,780
My leg sprain.

508
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,070
You okay, Baccarat-cwaan ?!

509
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,280
Gotcha!

510
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,530
Bad!

511
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,900
Hot, hot ...

512
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,440
Banana...?!

513
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,570
Intelligent enemies, yes.

514
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,650
You're a fool, huh ?!

515
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,070
He disappeares!

516
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,110
Again!

517
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,320
Damn, what the hell is he ?!

518
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,110
Strong Right!

519
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,030
The joy!

520
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,480
Nice punch.

521
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,190
Again, again, please!

522
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,360
What the hell is he ?!

523
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,070
Let me fight!

524
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,030
The fight will be over faster if the boss is defeated.

525
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,860
Interesting too. So you want to beat me

526
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,480
in my own town?

527
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,000
Of course.

528
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,030
This...

529
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,320
Zoro!

530
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,980
Don't move, guys!

531
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,360
Selfish, too, huh?

532
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,150
If you move, your whole body will be gold.

533
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,280
The strength of what?

534
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,360
Gold.

535
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,110
I'm Goru Goru fruit eaters.

536
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,860
With my gold, I'm free to cheat anyone.

537
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,900
What have you done to Zoro ?!

538
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,860
When entering this town,

539
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,860
You saw the gold powder, isn't it?

540
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,650
At that time, I put my gold strength

541
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,900
into your body.

542
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,190
The entire city is ...

543
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,820
is under my control.

544
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,610
As well as all human beings.

545
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,280
If so, return all the money you are borrowing.

546
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,980
Total it all worth 3 x 20 million berry!

547
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,070
So from the beginning you were ...

548
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,690
No one can defeat me!

549
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,820
Do not be too happy, yet...

550
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,860
Do not move!

551
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,900
Who?

552
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,320
Shut up!

553
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,110
You...

554
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,780
I understand!

555
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,040
We will prepare the money!

556
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,660
Give us time!

557
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,950
Hey, Nami!

558
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,250
Deal.

559
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,870
The deadline until tomorrow at 12 am.

560
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,580
If the money is not there ...

561
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:12,080
I will execute this person in front all of you!

562
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,160
What?

563
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,410
I know. I'll promise.

564
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,080
Huuooii!

565
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,290
Ah, of course.

566
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,040
This is the most exciting game!

567
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,370
Can you prepare the money until tomorrow?

568
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,790
or you will perish together ?!

569
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,910
Let me see the interesting shows.

570
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,120
I'm hungry!

571
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,500
Most importantly, we must think the ways to save Zoro!

572
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,200
Of course, but eat first!

573
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,450
Well, why?

574
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,040
But, we have to fill the stomach first.

575
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,080
Well, that's right.

576
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,540
Yosh, Let's eat!

577
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,500
There was a meat's smell!

578
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,450
Meat!

579
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,910
Ah, Luffy-san!

580
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,160
Geez.

581
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,950
Better cool off first.

582
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,330
Oh, sorry.

583
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,450
Wait!

584
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,830
Why?

585
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,830
Oh, looks like there is progress in you, huh.

586
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,330
Cat burglar.

587
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,540
You are also increasingly inattentive huh, Wolf burglar.

588
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,370
Duh!

589
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,250
Apparently it you, Carina.

590
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,790
Long time no see, Nami.

591
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,080
You're a friend of Tesoro?

592
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,950
You guys know each other?

593
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,910
Yes, right.

594
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,620
Nami and I are fellow thieves long time ago.

595
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,250
Yes, right?

596
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,620
It is not like that.

597
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,160
When I was a thief in East Blue,

598
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,620
me and her just often fought for treasure.

599
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,660
Do you often lose you?

600
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,290
The way you use is really tacky!

601
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,120
What do you said, cat burglar!

602
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,870
Wolf burglar!

603
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,160
Do not fight!

604
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,870
Eat first!

605
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,160
Forgive my attitude.

606
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,580
But, I was there as Tesoro's men.

607
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,080
So I had no other choice.

608
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,950
Relax, do not sweat it.

609
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:44,370
Don't say that you want to find Tesoro's treasure?

610
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,250
Tesoro's treasure?

611
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,830
According to legend, some wealth in this city

612
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,450
is 20% berry of the property around the world.

613
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,250
People call it Tesoro's treasure.

614
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,630
It is an honor for the thieves who managed to steal it.

615
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,130
All the thieves of the world trying to steal it,

616
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,800
But, until now no one else managed to steal it.

617
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,010
I've been stealing the key from Tesoro.

618
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,260
Key?

619
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,970
On the top floor alone, there are vault full gold.

620
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,010
So, you're ...

621
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,590
Yes, I'm after the vault!

622
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,760
And get the money worth 500 billion berry!

623
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,970
500 billion?

624
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,430
Was that great ?!

625
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,090
The vault's gold could buy a small country.

626
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,380
State?

627
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:35,590
Tesoro give part of his property in Tenryuubito.

628
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,590
Tenjou King, ya?

629
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:41,720
He uses the power of money to control Tenryuubito.

630
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,970
That's why the Navy and the World Government,

631
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,800
dare not complicate Tesoro, huh.

632
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,090
It turned out that way.

633
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,180
But, not only for the control of pirates,

634
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,130
He also uses money to control the dark world.

635
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,630
That the goal he really is.

636
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,260
So, if my advice ...

637
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,760
if we could get the money, your friend could return safely.

638
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:09,380
Rather than bother as it was, what about we just directly attack it?

639
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:16,090
You've seen it, right?
In our bodies there is strength Tesoro gold.

640
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,260
It makes us hard to beat.

641
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,680
Therefore, we have to play crafty.

642
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,130
And using the city's regulations for the win.

643
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,840
What can I do, huh?

644
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,550
Hey Nami, what she really can be trusted?

645
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,220
Now it's just the only way, right?

646
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:38,590
You sure this will work ?!

647
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,550
As long as there is a chance.

648
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,550
Yosh, let's do it!

649
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,180
That's it.

650
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,880
Geez, what can we do.

651
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,180
Our goal was 500 billion berry.

652
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,510
We're going to steal Tesoro's money!

653
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,550
It is betting that risked lives.

654
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,590
But, I'll give you 30% of its course.

655
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,840
No kidding! I gave the key!

656
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,300
There's a lot of us!

657
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,840
Without me, you can't do anything!

658
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,220
What did you said?

659
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,720
What are you doing?

660
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,470
You're okay, Tempo?

661
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,300
Hey, hey.

662
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,010
What do you guys do on Tesoro-sama's men like us?

663
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,880
Sorry, forgive us.

664
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,800
Shit!

665
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,010
Your debt has increase 20 thousand berry!

666
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,590
Impossible!

667
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,010
They are ... children earlier.

668
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,510
They were small and had to pay the debt for the sake of the family.

669
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,220
Forced labour and slave of Tesoro.

670
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,680
What?

671
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,130
Do you mind?

672
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,840
Wait a minute.

673
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,650
What are the children have done?

674
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,100
The store manager!

675
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,600
Don't you know how to educate children?

676
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,900
Please forgive them.

677
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,980
Taught by Tesoro-sama together,

678
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,600
have you forgotten?

679
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,560
You have to smile at customers!

680
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,850
Come on, smile at me!

681
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,400
Do you want your whole family dead?

682
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,730
More sincere, again!

683
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,560
Sorry, forgive them.

684
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,440
Fake smile!

685
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,940
They jerk!

686
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,150
Teach your people with the right, you know ?!

687
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,270
Come on, why?

688
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,850
Uncle!

689
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,100
Manager!

690
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,150
I'm fine, Rikka.

691
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,810
Go back to work.

692
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,980
Hoi!

693
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,060
Why did not you fight back?

694
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,980
It's no use!

695
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,190
Why?

696
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,940
If there is no money, there is no freedom at all!

697
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,350
Brother!

698
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,310
Right on time, too.

699
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,270
Chiper Pol .... or is called what?

700
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,480
This time is for gold packaging to Tenryuubito's ship.

701
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:32,730
Leave it to Spandam of CP-0's!

702
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,690
Well, I'm counting on you.

703
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,400
This is not how.

704
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,770
Woah, what?

705
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,270
Please accept.

706
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,730
That person!

707
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,900
What is wrong? You do not want?

708
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,480
This, this.

709
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,520
Anyway, I received this first.

710
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,150
By the way, now this Straw Hat Pirates was on this ship, lo.

711
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:03,900
What?

712
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,190
Don't make any trouble.

713
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,230
Will this run smoothly?

714
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:19,690
We leave it to people like that?

715
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,190
Send someone more useful again here.

716
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,600
More useful in Chiper Pol.

717
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,730
And also, tell him to send 10 Navy ships here.

718
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,730
Ready to execute.

719
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,270
I knew it.

720
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,730
So, where is Max?

721
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,980
If it is, I still do not get.

722
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:46,520
That man, surely he was scared there.

723
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,600
Oh yes, they are also there, lo.

724
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,650
Who?

725
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,600
Straw Hat Pirates.

726
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,410
10 warships, you say?

727
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,370
Do not make me laugh!

728
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,200
Plus, for pirates like Tesoro?

729
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,250
Why the Navy must help the enemy?

730
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:21,200
Since when CP-0 become Tesoro's men?

731
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,700
This is not for Tesoro!

732
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,790
This is for the success of the mission.

733
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,330
Just do your job.

734
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,790
Shut up and prepare 10 ships!

735
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:35,540
Who do you think you're talking to?

736
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:39,950
Do not be proud of you!

737
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,410
Rob Lucci!

Geez.

740
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,870
Until made posters of all.

741
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,950
Hoi, Luffy!

742
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,620
Enough for today!

743
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,370
Tomorrow, we should be ready.

744
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,200
Carina.

745
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,370
We're ready.

746
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,120
Oh?

747
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,040
Where have you been?

748
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,830
There is little affairs.

749
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,700
I thought you were going to run away again.

750
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,370
I run away? When?

751
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,830
Do not pretend to forget.

752
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,120
When we steal the treasure of the pirate,

753
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,870
and we both caught.

754
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
Oh.

755
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:13,790
At that time, we both caught

756
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:16,000
and was severely tortured.

757
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:23,580
So, who wants to die first?

758
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:32,830
We will restore everything.

759
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:37,120
The money we get for this, we will give everything.

760
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:40,450
So, forgive us both.

761
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:41,580
Carina!

762
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,500
It's OK.

763
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,250
Come back before sunset.

764
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:51,750
If you do not come back, he'll kill.

765
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,910
Trust me!

766
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,620
I will definitely be back!

767
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:01,020
But, you never go back!

768
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,930
Time has run out.

769
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:05,600
Your friend is sneaky as well, right.

770
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:09,100
He is not my friend.

771
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:12,680
Hey, let's make a deal.

772
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:16,970
I would give my treasure there somewhere.

773
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:20,350
And a calling into a shameful my life with it.

774
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:26,520
I'm sorry, Carina. I've took all of it.

775
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,470
Impossible!

776
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:31,270
That's unfortunate, yes.

777
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:35,100
Money for the harvest has been stolen.

778
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,890
Don't raised again, it is.

779
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,770
I almost died, you know!

780
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,270
When I returned the money to him,

781
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,350
both of us would be killed.

782
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,470
At that time, I had no other choice.

783
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,270
You are!

784
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:04,850
If this time you fool me again, I will not forgive you!

785
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,720
Wolf burglar.

786
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:10,350
Yes.

787
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:12,680
Cat burglar.

788
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,310
Let's do the plan.

789
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,680
Yosh!

790
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,850
But, what's the plan ?!

791
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,810
Duh! I just explained it ?!

792
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,350
Here's where the gold's vault located.

793
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,560
High class area.

794
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,520
That's where the gold's vault is.

795
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:53,310
In it, there is money worth 500 billion berry.

796
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:59,560
Floors, walls, and roof are made of gold.

797
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,180
So it's rather hard to crack.

798
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,680
Doesn't it indestructible?

799
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:06,140
Don't. Tesoro is an intelligent power user.

800
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,470
The whole system in this city is connected to him.

801
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,390
If there is the slightest attack,

802
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,220
he will find out soon.

803
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:17,180
Hoi hoi, then how do we get in?

804
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:20,520
Through this way. Here is a spiral staircase.

805
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,680
This way is not guarded.

806
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,930
But this place is full of Denden Mushi CCTV.

807
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,560
If not being careful, we will be caught.

808
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,020
But there is an exit.

809
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,430
So, I need your help.

810
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,890
First, Team A.

811
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,060
You will climb the hotel to the top floor!

812
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,680
Sneak into the watch tower.

813
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,850
And go to the Control Room.

814
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,350
Exactly upper part of the room is where the Denden Mushi's Host.

815
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,770
If you take over that, CCTV at the spiral staircase will be dead.

816
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:59,910
Next, Team B.

817
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:03,250
The first step is to take the elevator.

818
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:06,290
Straight to the VIP's area.

819
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:09,750
We must not be caught from Tanaka-san.

820
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,040
Go inside the high class area.

821
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,750
and from there, we should take the door.

822
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,540
If we pass the guards,

823
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,830
we just have to take the big road at the back door.

824
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,330
and follow the spiral staircase.

825
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,330
While the Denden Mushi CCTV has been dead,

826
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,460
we should go up through the staircase faster.

827
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,410
While in front of gold's vault. By using these keys,

828
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,620
I'll open it.

829
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:39,830
Just take the money by camouflaged

830
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,290
and go out through the main door.

831
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,370
By doing so, mission accomplished!

832
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:57,040
Yosh!

833
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,210
Still half, huh.

834
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,370
How do I get up there?

835
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:08,960
Leave it to me.

836
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,580
I've got a spy tool given Usopp.

837
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,620
Spy tool?

838
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,620
Well, just watch.

839
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,210
Franky

840
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:23,750
Sponge Rocket!

841
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,830
Great! Spy tools!

842
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,290
Isn't it?

843
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:42,500
Eh?

844
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:46,290
Oh yeah, Sanji-san can fly, right?

845
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,040
How can I fly with carrying this heavy load?

846
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:53,830
Besides, if I had to protect the women, I'm ready to do it.

847
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,250
Ssh. They come.

Hello guards.

851
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,080
Carina-san.

852
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:07,710
Hey, where it would be escorted to?

853
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:10,330
Anoo, this would be escorted to the VIP room.

854
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:14,370
There are customers who were waiting for him.

855
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,710
Let me see.

856
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:19,710
Great.

857
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,870
Huge.

858
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,790
Yes, it's huge.

859
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,620
Very beautiful.

860
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,660
Yes, beautiful.

861
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,870
Thank you. The spirit drove him, huh.

862
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,870
Good!

863
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,250
In this way, smoothly.

864
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,500
Three boxes of metal dice.

865
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,220
Who is this?

866
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,260
Carisan-sama, please sign in.

867
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,390
It's beautiful scenery!

868
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:15,890
Be careful!

869
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,640
Stay out of sight!

870
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,800
Good!

871
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,760
Yosh!

872
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,970
Our destination is where the guards are.

873
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:32,890
I understand!

874
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,390
Luffy!

875
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:46,640
You're okay?

876
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,010
I also want to fall!

877
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,470
Hold me!

878
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:04,050
Coup de Boo!

879
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,590
Come on!

880
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,800
Finally!

881
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,260
Defrauding success!

882
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,260
Let's go!

883
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,140
That the place where the guards are!

884
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,180
From here, turn right to spiral staircase!

885
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,800
The road is maintained.

886
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,640
Leave it to me.

887
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,590
Onee-sama really great.

888
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,140
Come in.

889
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:05,010
I've never been here before, so I do not know what happened here.

890
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,140
This...

891
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:15,390
Red-eyed owl.

892
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:16,390
What's that?

893
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,220
If you were exposed to the red eye,

894
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,840
they will respond and issue a trap.

895
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:24,430
They...

896
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,720
I knew it.

897
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,510
What is wrong?

898
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,340
I know the direction in which they point.

899
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,220
"Up, down, up."

900
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,430
Masterful. You know the language of animals.

901
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:40,550
That does not make me happy at all.

902
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:41,760
Come on!

903
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,390
Now!

904
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:50,470
Stop!

905
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,260
Now run!

906
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,640
Come on!

907
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:57,680
Bad!

908
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,480
Run fast!

909
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,230
Brook! Quick!

910
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,060
Yes! Wait, I had trouble running!

911
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,440
Ah, bad!

912
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,150
Brook!

913
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:24,020
E-Eh?

914
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:29,300
It seems that you were not living beings, they do not respond.

915
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:31,110
Really cruel!

916
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,400
We've arrived at the spiral staircase, huh.

917
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:40,650
Franky. What's the situation?

918
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,690
Almost done.

919
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:46,810
Yosh.

920
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,610
That's it. The Denden Mushi's Host.

921
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:53,980
It is Denden Mushi that sends the entire signal.

922
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,940
By connecting with the cable number 3.

923
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:59,310
It will be connected to CCTV in a spiral staircase.

924
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,360
That one, huh.

925
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,520
If we put a white Denden Mushi there,

926
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:06,310
it's CCTV will die.

927
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:07,980
Yosh. Understood.

928
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,940
If you completed, return immediately!

929
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,730
Now!

930
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,440
Almost!

931
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:30,940
Be careful!

932
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:31,980
Yosh!

933
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:39,480
Yosh. Now stay put Denden Mushi.

934
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,110
This...

935
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:02,610
Infiltration!

936
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,360
Brother!

937
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,610
H-He!

938
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,770
Hey, caught you?

939
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,060
Bad!

940
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:16,310
Shoot!

941
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,560
They are there!

942
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,440
We retreat, Luffy!

943
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:26,440
Yes.

944
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,900
EDITED BY ACAPCOOL999 {\\ c & HF9EB88 &} RESYNC ORIGIN PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE CREDIT

945
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,610
Franky!

946
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:52,310
I can't believe you dare to go into a place like this.

947
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,400
Location!

948
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:55,150
Geez.

949
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,800
Don't you care about the lives of your friends that you to dare to do this?

950
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,680
Zoro!

951
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:06,260
How? It's beautiful, isn't it?

952
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:10,130
Do you not feel that it was a suitable place to execute it?

953
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:15,090
This is an entertainment.

954
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:18,090
How, Straw Hat?

955
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,970
Laugh.

956
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:26,090
I will not laugh!

957
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:28,550
I'll punch you!

958
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:37,880
Gold Bumper

959
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,180
There's no point!

960
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,550
I'm unbeaten in this city!

961
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,470
Can not be separated!

962
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,300
Remember this well!

963
01:03:56,510 --> 01:04:00,340
Without the money in the world, the world will not do!

964
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:03,130
Being a slave is the only option!

965
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,260
Shut up!

966
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:07,090
This thing will not be able to make me lose!

967
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,340
This thing?!

968
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,220
If you want to do,

969
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:15,050
just try it!

970
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:19,470
Hopefully we can meet again in the future!

971
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,760
Are you entertained? This is the name of entertainment.

972
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,800
Please wait for the next release of Gran Tesoro.

973
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,760
What the hell.

974
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:57,340
Indeed ... against it will be pointless.

975
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,300
Can I take them all?

976
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:06,180
Its up to you.

977
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,470
Importantly, first check all places!

978
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,340
Ready to execute!

979
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:14,180
Oh no, they're here!

980
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,800
If this continues, we will be in danger!

981
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:19,220
Importantly, we have to get out of here first.

982
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:24,630
They are there!

983
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:25,840
Sanji-kun!

984
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:27,090
Leave it to me!

985
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,550
Concasse!

986
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:36,630
Diable Jamble

987
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,550
(New Kick :))

988
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:44,630
Wait, you're safe here!

989
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,510
After them!

990
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:46,380
Through this way!

991
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,630
What place is this?

992
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:59,080
It is among the top Tenryuubito area.

993
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,670
Tenryuubito?

994
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,420
They...

995
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,830
Hey, if this keeps up ...

996
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,790
Escape is not an option.

997
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,880
This place determines the winner.

998
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,330
Brook!

999
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:43,210
Stupid ... it was not him!

1000
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,790
Franky.

1001
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,420
What happened?

1002
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,500
Where am I?

1003
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,250
The place is filled with gold!

1004
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:01,130
Everything is made of gold, huh.

1005
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,790
Great.

1006
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:10,210
Give us water.

1007
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,630
Water.

1008
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:15,420
Give us a drink.

1009
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,040
What?

1010
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:21,210
We beg, we will give all our money.

1011
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:23,500
We do not even have water.

1012
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:26,790
Shit.

1013
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:27,960
Damn!

1014
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,670
You have loads of money, huh?

1015
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,880
There's no point!

1016
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,040
Even gold is not useful.

1017
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:45,670
In the city's golden prison, gold is the most valuable.

1018
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,000
Gold is the most valuable?

1019
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:48,960
Yes.

1020
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:52,710
Yes. All the gold that is stored by Tesoro here ...

1021
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,210
Formed into a golden city of gold ...

1022
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:08,040
Many people are already controlled by gold.

1023
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,790
There is only gold and no food.

1024
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,830
Tesoro greatly enjoyed our suffering.

1025
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,330
Uncle who?

1026
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,170
Me?

1027
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,830
I'm just a loser.

1028
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,170
I remember him!

1029
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,580
You're Raise Max ,isn't it?

1030
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:34,880
Who is that?

1031
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,580
You do not know, huh?

1032
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:40,580
Raise Max, not just the person who is unbeatable ...

1033
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:42,290
He is a legendary casino players.

1034
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:45,880
Since I was a child, I was admired the great man.

1035
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:49,830
If I'm not wrong, you joined the Revolutionary Army.

1036
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:53,500
It's true I was Raise Max.

1037
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,750
People who are unbeaten in the casino.

1038
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:58,040
But there are two reasons.

1039
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:01,370
He has lost the bet of his life?

1040
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,990
But I'm not wearing that name.

1041
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:06,040
And had no connection with the Revolutionary Army.

1042
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,200
I could have lost the whole town.

1043
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:12,830
When I lose in the casino,

1044
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:16,200
Raise Max is dead.

1045
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:20,240
Shit. We must hasten to help Zoro.

1046
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,120
Hey, was there is an exit here?

1047
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,540
There is no exit.

1048
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,120
There was no other choice but to die.

1049
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:25,910
Shit.

1050
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,490
Yosh. Let me crush it!

1051
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:28,400
Gomu-Gomu no

1052
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,290
Wait wait, if the gold was destroyed Tesoro will know.

1053
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:33,160
Anyway what you can with your hands like that?

1054
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,790
If my hand couldn't do it, I could still use my head!

1055
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:35,740
Gomu-Gomu no

1056
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:36,700
Stop!

1057
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,410
That's enough, Straw Hats boy!

1058
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,290
Just give up.

1059
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:44,410
As long as there is still gold in your body,

1060
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,370
you can't beat Tesoro!

1061
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:48,160
Then, we just get the gold out from the body!

1062
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:50,080
Is there a way to get it out?

1063
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:51,540
That...

1064
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:54,410
Not possible if there is no way at all.

1065
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:58,370
Tesoro gold strength is the same as devil fruit powers.

1066
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:03,160
By using sea water, the gold that is in our bodies will disappear.

1067
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:05,450
Yosh. So I just need to find the sea.

1068
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:08,450
Useless. If someone is doing it on this ship,

1069
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:11,080
Tesoro would not allow such a thing!

1070
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:15,580
The only way to get to the sea water was through a pipe.

1071
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:18,410
This place is entirely made of gold.

1072
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:21,120
Until to the bottom was also made of gold.

1073
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:24,040
At the bottom of this place,

1074
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,580
There is a pipe that is connected with the sea water.

1075
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:32,490
But, the only way is this hole.

1076
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:37,450
Many people who try it for this, but they all failed.

1077
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:42,950
Bat?

1078
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,790
This is a small chance. Give it up!

1079
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:48,660
No!

1080
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,330
I will not give up!

1081
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:52,790
I'm going!

1082
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:05,700
Franky, quickly went down!

1083
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:06,540
Yoo!

1084
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,080
Luffy surely soon be able to go through this,

1085
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,080
and could even beat the Tesoro that!

1086
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,240
He is a person who believes that nothing is impossible!

1087
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:17,580
It's like gambling, right?

1088
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:20,370
It's worth risking my life.

1089
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:25,290
"Nothing is impossible", huh.

1090
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,450
Easy to be said.

1091
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,540
Interesting.

1092
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,830
Thank you, Roronoa Zoro.

1093
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:51,330
Blessings, our ticket sales set a new record.

1094
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,700
How? Did you have fun?

1095
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,620
Not so bad, huh.

1096
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,860
They will not be able to get the money.

1097
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:12,240
Do you still believe in your friends?

1098
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:15,240
As if there could still be trusted?

1099
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:22,240
Actually, in hopes it would be despair.

1100
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,490
I've heard it ~

1101
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:35,740
What actually happens ~?

1102
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:41,360
Is it true there are thieves who steal our money ~?

1103
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:45,110
What's going on?

1104
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,200
You are not polite at all.

1105
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:49,490
F-Forgive us!

1106
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:53,030
The gold's vault has been tightened, so please do not worry about it.

1107
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:54,950
No.

1108
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,700
I could not believe you guys talk!

1109
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:03,360
Now, order all the people to go to the vault!

1110
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:04,780
Impossible!

1111
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:06,610
How dare you fight me!

1112
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:10,110
You probably also associates of with the thieves!

1113
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:13,610
So do you mean to blame us?

1114
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:14,740
N-Not like that.

1115
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,200
We did not dare.

1116
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,450
Do you want to fight Tenryuubito ?!

1117
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:21,740
You know the consequences, right?

1118
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:24,280
You understand?

1119
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:30,030
G-Good. Immediately implemented.

1120
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:34,070
Hurry up, otherwise we are toast.

1121
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,360
Correct.

1122
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,240
But there was nothing more to be done.

1123
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,240
We already do not have time anymore to execute Zoro!

1124
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:52,200
How much are they ?!

1125
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:56,780
Bad!

1126
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:01,860
You're okay ?!

1127
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:02,610
Yes.

1128
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:03,530
Come on!

1129
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,410
Zoro!

1130
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:07,610
Straw Hats boy!

1131
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:10,410
This sound ?!

1132
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:12,410
What?!

1133
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,660
The fans were huge!

1134
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,910
The road should go down from here.

1135
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,820
But this is impossible if you can pass.

1136
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,240
It is a trap created Tesoro.

1137
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,990
Because it is made of sea stone,

1138
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:31,320
Haki, weapons, or the devil fruit powers will not succeed.

1139
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:32,610
Just give up!

1140
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,910
Don't want! Let me!

1141
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:35,910
Do not!

1142
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:37,570
You idiot!

1143
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,110
Luffy!

1144
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,240
It was impossible, surrender!

1145
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,170
Not impossible! I will never give up!

1146
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:00,590
Shit!

1147
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,220
Once again!

1148
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:05,300
Shit!

1149
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:08,550
Shit!

1150
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:10,300
Straw Hats boy!

1151
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:11,840
He had crossed the limits!

1152
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:19,970
We should go from here.

1153
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,130
Still not yet!

1154
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:28,340
I ... I will not give up!

1155
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,300
I...

1156
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,220
I understand.

1157
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:39,630
Let me destroy the fan.

1158
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:50,380
Uncle.

1159
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:52,220
What would you do?

1160
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,840
It was tantamount to gambling.

1161
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,430
Focus is required.

1162
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,180
Now!

1163
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:09,380
EDITED BY ACAPCOOL999 {\\ c & HF9EB88 &} RESYNC ORIGIN PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE CREDIT

1164
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,760
Max!

1165
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:11,590
Uncle!

1166
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,800
Max!

1167
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,840
Don't want! I will not give up!

1168
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,130
I will never give up!

1169
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:37,470
I will not give up!

1170
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:42,340
Success!

1171
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:43,840
Nice!

1172
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,050
Stop!

1173
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:58,260
It is impossible if only on his own!

1174
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:08,260
You!

1175
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:14,630
I do not want to return in empty hand!

1176
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,840
We want freedom!

1177
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:24,260
Great!

1178
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,130
Stalled!

1179
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:31,180
Straw Hats boy!

1180
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:34,590
You must beat Tesoro!

1181
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:36,800
Well!

1182
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:38,720
I know!

1183
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:51,590
Success!

1184
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:53,340
It's the pipe!

1185
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:57,340
Success!

1186
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:02,800
Finally got around to.

1187
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:05,260
So this is the main entrance gold's vault.

1188
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,090
Just to enter this key, then ...

1189
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,840
This is...

1190
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,930
our victory.

1191
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:38,800
Showtime!

1192
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:50,180
What does this mean?

1193
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,510
You're shocked, right?

1194
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,010
It is the theater.

1195
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:01,340
Theater ...

1196
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:03,090
Correct.

1197
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:08,760
Don't you think here is the good place to execute Roronoa Zoro ?!

1198
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:11,430
Look!

1199
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,180
Zoro!

1200
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,260
The scenery is nice, is not it?

1201
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:20,180
Neither here is not gold warehouse, nor the 5,000 billion berry.

1202
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:24,050
All gold is already packed in the Tenryuubito's.

1203
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:27,180
You all have been deceived!

1204
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:31,130
By the great of me, and Carina.

1205
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,260
Carina! You...?

1206
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,220
I have said from the beginning, right?

1207
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:38,760
This is Gran Tesoro.

1208
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,430
The fooled one will lose.

1209
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,550
Impossible!

1210
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,760
Damn!

1211
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:50,840
Looking good!

1212
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,630
Good!

1213
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,970
We are always watching you.

1214
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:58,800
You become a tool of our gambling.

1215
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,340
How stupid you think there gold's vault.

1216
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:05,510
We've worked hard to set up this game for you.

1217
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,050
Good work.

1218
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:12,010
For the sake of earning money with his life but in the end even cheated.

1219
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:16,930
This what we called a great show!

1220
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:19,590
Very beautiful.

1221
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,800
Because you have given an interesting game.

1222
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,970
Instead, I show interesting performances.

1223
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:31,800
And that this was really great.

1224
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,800
Luffy!

1225
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:38,760
Done!

1226
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:41,630
Well, Luffy! Destroy it!

1227
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,510
And remove the seawater!

1228
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:44,840
I know!

1229
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,930
Gomu-Gomu no

1230
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:50,180
Kane

1231
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:01,590
Dangerous! I can't hit the sea!

1232
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:11,180
My body felt the difference, the gold is gone!

1233
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:12,840
Success! We did it!

1234
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,220
In this way, we are free!

1235
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:16,090
We are free!

1236
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:24,970
What happened?

1237
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:31,220
Bad!

1238
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:37,470
We are caught ?!

1239
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:43,550
Luffy!

1240
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:44,760
Franky!

1241
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:45,800
Damn!

1242
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:55,220
Hope that turns into despair.

1243
01:21:55,390 --> 01:22:00,640
This is the main entertainment!

1244
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:04,340
Money is power. Money is everything.

1245
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:07,680
People who have no money, can't get anything.

1246
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,010
Couldn't get the love, or dream,

1247
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:12,930
Can't have the strength, or even freedom.

1248
01:22:13,010 --> 01:22:14,510
Even...

1249
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:16,640
Hope was also not able to.

1250
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:20,220
Though already come this far!

1251
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:29,140
Luffy!

1252
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:39,640
Noisy!

1253
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:43,140
Asshole bastard!

1254
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,300
Sanji-kun!

1255
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:46,970
Then ... the stage at last!

1256
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:11,510
The scenes are very good!

1257
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,010
Tesoro!

1258
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:17,300
Then you just enjoy it.

1259
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,430
Roronoa Zoro ...

1260
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,890
will be executed!

1261
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:25,510
All...

1262
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:29,970
Let's give applause to them!

1263
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:39,220
Gold Sprash!

1264
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:51,930
Goodbye, Straw Hat Pirates!

1265
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:55,010
With this, I'm the one who wins.

1266
01:23:55,300 --> 01:24:00,100
This is an entertainment!

1267
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:18,680
What is this?

1268
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,220
What happened?

1269
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:25,060
What does this mean?

1270
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,310
What are you laughing at?

1271
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,220
Who actually been fooled?

1272
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,390
What?

1273
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,640
I-It ... The sea.

1274
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,010
What did you say?

1275
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:03,930
Tesoro-sama!

1276
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:06,310
Through this way!

1277
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,890
Great!

1278
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,510
This sea!

1279
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,890
Rain sea water!

1280
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:24,680
With this, Tesoro will not be in power again!

1281
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,060
We are free!

1282
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,060
Finally...

1283
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,970
we are free!

1284
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:54,260
Suupeerrr

1285
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:57,850
Franky!

1286
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:00,470
Looks like we make it in time.

1287
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:07,310
What are you doing?

1288
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:13,510
Actually we already know your intention to shows the gold powder from the beginning.

1289
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,220
Thanks to the children of your loyalty, Carina.

1290
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,560
Forgive me...

1291
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,010
Parties that I chose was ...

1292
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,720
Straw Hat Pirates.

1293
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:25,430
Carina.

1294
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:30,470
All that you have seen, we were set.

1295
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:35,470
For us, gold's vault or gold, not a problem!

1296
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:40,100
What is important is removing sea water.

1297
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:46,560
It was also one of the plan.

1298
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:51,100
Our goal from the beginning was open seawater pipes.

1299
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,760
Of course. Luffy didn't know anything.

1300
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:57,970
We don't need to follow your rules again.

1301
01:26:58,140 --> 01:26:59,930
We will also fight!

1302
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,060
Now, you must follow our rules!

1303
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:05,980
We are pirates.

1304
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:22,690
We were able to act independently.

1305
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:26,640
Then, return our friend!

1306
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:32,560
TESORO!

1307
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:45,520
Luffy!

1308
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:48,640
Good Luffy! The plan went well!

1309
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:52,230
Plan?

1310
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:56,850
Yes. Now, beat that guy!

1311
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:58,690
Dammit!

1312
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:01,190
Eh, didn't you said it yourself?

1313
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:03,390
This is Gran Tesoro.

1314
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:05,770
Who have been deceived is a loser!

1315
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,730
This is new...

1316
01:28:12,730 --> 01:28:16,350
The main entertainment!

1317
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:18,810
I would...

1318
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:20,560
beat you!

1319
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:25,230
How is your mood today?

1320
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:30,020
When your hope turned into despair.

1321
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,520
What's so hopeless.

1322
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,640
How is it desperation.

1323
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,190
I will be a star!

1324
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,480
Do not sing something that is meaningful!

1325
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,310
Useless!

1326
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:47,480
Noisy, Tesoro!

1327
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,560
If only we had the money.

1328
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:52,230
In this way, we are partners.

1329
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:54,980
Stupid brat! You don't want to pay?

1330
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,100
The song was nice, yes.

1331
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:04,600
Someday I will change.

1332
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,270
Damn ...

1333
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:08,640
But my heart will not change.

1334
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:11,940
Just change, I will definitely buy you.

1335
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:15,100
If you have money, you can give anything.

1336
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:15,770
Noisy!

1337
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:18,020
Thank you!

1338
01:29:18,130 --> 01:29:21,770
With this feeling, I've been pleased.

1339
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:25,890
... I'm very happy!

1340
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,390
In front of me...

1341
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,520
In front of me...

1342
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:47,060
In front of me...

1343
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:48,440
Tesoro-sama ...

1344
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:52,520
Don't laugh at me!

1345
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:08,570
What?

1346
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:29,440
So what if you managed to open it?

1347
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:32,820
I just close it again!

1348
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,690
Bad! My handle!

1349
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:39,030
Coup de Burst!

1350
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:47,150
All the power in this town is in my hands!

1351
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,650
Anything that can be laughed at ...

1352
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:52,280
I define it!

1353
01:30:56,650 --> 01:30:58,280
Impossible!

1354
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:02,240
I've had enough!

1355
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:20,780
He was horrifying!

1356
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,190
What is this?

1357
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:32,190
Then let's begin to its greatest show!

1358
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:51,740
What do you know, the Straw Hats?

1359
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,440
I'm the one who controls this world!

1360
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:59,990
You are nothing but scum!

1361
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,360
I have the power of a god!

1362
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,490
Noisy!

1363
01:32:12,210 --> 01:32:16,820
I already told you, I will not give up

1364
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,280
Gear Third

1365
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:21,070
Gomu-Gomu no

1366
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:24,150
Elephant Gun

1367
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:29,530
Do not be too confident!

1368
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:46,110
You...

1369
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,400
Sister.

1370
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,360
Luffy...

1371
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:00,280
You can too.

1372
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,660
Shucks!

1373
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:04,540
Passable.

1374
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:08,000
Soon ... launch

1375
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:14,950
The joy!

1376
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:19,080
Show your abilities again!

1377
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:21,040
Do you really want to start

1378
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:26,040
This is not an ordinary steel, eh.

1379
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:31,040
This is the power of granting of the Tesoro-sama, Gold Armor!

1380
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,620
Gold Armor?!

1381
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:37,120
In other words, our strength

1382
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,790
increased dramatically.

1383
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:44,950
Then, you want money, isn't?

1384
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:49,750
I'll give you a special gold prize!

1385
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:53,540
Well, make it more interesting!

1386
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:58,080
You are mine.

1387
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,120
Ouch.

1388
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:08,370
What is this? Power ...

1389
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:11,410
You're careless.

1390
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:15,620
It was a chain is made from sea rocks.

1391
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:17,660
Straw Hats!

1392
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:19,700
What a coincidence!

1393
01:34:19,870 --> 01:34:22,910
I will eliminate you now!

1394
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,410
You...

1395
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,330
who?

1396
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:31,330
Damn, if you forget ...

1397
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:34,910
I'll help you remember!

1398
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,000
Satan where are you ?!

1399
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:44,910
You...

1400
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:47,250
I've decided ...

1401
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:51,580
I will not give it up again.

1402
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:54,870
I have to fight.

1403
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:57,250
I am indeed...

1404
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:59,290
want freedom!

1405
01:34:59,290 --> 01:35:00,700
Huh?

1406
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:03,750
That's it!

1407
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,750
What's freedom? Stupid!

1408
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:09,790
Look!

1409
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:13,620
Do you think you can win?

1410
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:18,870
Hear! In this world the one that has the power will win!

1411
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:23,290
It's not necessarily ...

1412
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:27,910
What?

1413
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:28,950
Uncle?

1414
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:30,500
Hoi, boy!

1415
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:33,750
I would also join. Calm down, we will win!

1416
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:36,620
We definitely win this fight!

1417
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,620
Trust me!

1418
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:43,410
I was the legendary casino players, Raise Max.

1419
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:45,700
Well!

1420
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:50,410
Let us seize the freedom!

1421
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:53,910
They!

1422
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,750
You...

1423
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:59,660
just annoying!

1424
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:12,170
Yesh...

1425
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:15,130
Ui-Tora Gari

1426
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:19,920
The joy of ...

1427
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:23,130
Senhachiju Pound Ho

1428
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:33,590
Shut up!

1429
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:38,220
Again, taste this!

1430
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:42,550
You...

1431
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:51,340
Did you know?

1432
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:54,130
How to avoid losing the gamble?

1433
01:36:55,340 --> 01:37:00,050
Take back the coin, then use it to play again!

1434
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,800
Interesting too.

1435
01:37:02,010 --> 01:37:04,380
Let's start!

1436
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:23,720
Well, can you arrest me?

1437
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:29,050
Shit!

1438
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:35,840
Let me torture you first ...

1439
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,340
Then kill!

1440
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:38,380
Noisy!

1441
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:42,010
Do not move, yes.

1442
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:45,010
Damn!

1443
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:59,380
What did he do?!

1444
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:01,840
He even took his ally's luck ?!

1445
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:03,590
Anyway, this is an opportunity.

1446
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,840
Midori Boshi - Dokuro Bakahatsu

1447
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:12,670
What?!

1448
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:18,760
Eh, once lucky.

1449
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,380
Strength of Raki Raki fruit,

1450
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,670
Not just take other people's luck,

1451
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,590
but also could use the luck of others.

1452
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:32,550
In other words, now I'm invincible.

1453
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:36,220
If I fight you anyway.

1454
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:38,340
By this alone is enough.

1455
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:40,880
I will beat you just with this coin.

1456
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:43,130
What...?

1457
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:46,130
We will not be defeated so easily!

1458
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:48,880
Well, we'll see.

1459
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,060
I'll blast you!

1460
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,810
NO!

1461
01:39:16,730 --> 01:39:18,600
Eh, once lucky.

1462
01:39:18,650 --> 01:39:21,060
How should we fight it?

1463
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,980
We just kept attacking.

1464
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:24,730
He might not be lucky continues.

1465
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:28,650
What you can survive until then?

1466
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:31,350
What to do!

1467
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:33,730
What?

1468
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:35,440
Oii!

1469
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:38,100
Impossible!

1470
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:45,730
Eh, that's only?

1471
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:48,650
This is just a warm up.

1472
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:50,730
Damn, how about this ?!

1473
01:39:50,770 --> 01:39:53,850
I have an idea.

1474
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,020
Hissatsu

1475
01:39:58,480 --> 01:39:59,850
Usopp da!

1476
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:03,650
Well, well. He escaped?

1477
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:05,690
Friends are cowards, huh.

1478
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:12,440
Tesoro!

1479
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:22,480
Luffy!

1480
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,600
It is over yet?

1481
01:40:25,810 --> 01:40:26,940
Not yet!

1482
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:32,600
Grizzly Magnum

1483
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,650
Not too bad.

1484
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:39,350
Shot of the 500 million are great!

1485
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:48,520
Shoot!

1486
01:40:57,310 --> 01:40:58,520
What?

1487
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,900
Wait a minute!

1488
01:41:01,230 --> 01:41:04,190
Aren't we not commanded to help Tesoro and get the Tenjou gold?

1489
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:05,650
And follow the plan.

1490
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:07,600
But why do we even shot at it?

1491
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,690
We can hurt people!

1492
01:41:09,850 --> 01:41:11,150
Continue?

1493
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:12,900
Hey, Navy!

1494
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,310
Why are you shooting at Tesoro?

1495
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:18,350
Hei!

1496
01:41:18,350 --> 01:41:20,230
What are you doing?

1497
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,350
Say something!

1498
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,650
Quick help us!

1499
01:41:26,150 --> 01:41:27,520
Hello hello ...

1500
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:29,940
Keep shooting!

1501
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:32,350
This is for the success of the mission.

1502
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,190
Destroy Tesoro!

1503
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:38,520
Navigate the entire cannon!

1504
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:40,020
Ready!

1505
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:41,980
Target : Tesoro!

1506
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:43,060
Shoot!

1507
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:46,020
Hiken

1508
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:55,850
What was your purpose is actually here, Revolutionary Army?

1509
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:58,810
Instead of business as usual?

1510
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:01,790
I will not let you go with your own wishes, CP-0!

1511
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:06,620
Additionally, this is the fight my brother.

1512
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:08,830
I will not let you bother him.

1513
01:42:10,410 --> 01:42:12,870
Tch. Navy just only intervened!

1514
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,330
I'll show you the consequences

1515
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:17,330
the power of the gods!

1516
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:30,910
Is this your justice?

1517
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:33,830
No, but freedom!

1518
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:36,910
I do not care!

1519
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:45,700
Fear ...

1520
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:49,080
This is the power of a god!

1521
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:52,240
Tesoro!

1522
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:56,540
Gomu-Gomu no

1523
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:59,200
Jet Hawk!

1524
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:05,700
Full strength!

1525
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:11,160
Gold Emperor!

1526
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:19,910
Straw Hats brat!

1527
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:40,490
How can you?

1528
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:46,490
Nice expression, Carina!

1529
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:48,870
I'm very disappointed in you!

1530
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:55,120
Carina!

1531
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:59,120
Nami...

1532
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:03,330
Why did you help me?

1533
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:06,410
I'm just returning the favor.

1534
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:06,990
Eh?

1535
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:11,910
At that time, in fact you want to help me, right?

1536
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:19,660
You've been fooled, huh?

1537
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:23,790
You!

1538
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:26,330
Your treasures ...

1539
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:30,370
I'll get it ...

1540
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:32,580
Stupid!

1541
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:35,830
At that time, I understand completely!

1542
01:44:36,490 --> 01:44:37,660
Get him!

1543
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:43,450
In order to save both of us, are you willing to risk your life.

1544
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:44,620
Nami.

1545
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:47,200
Carina...

1546
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:51,290
You are our friends, right?

1547
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:53,040
If so, trust me ...

1548
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:57,120
They definitely will not lose.

1549
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:59,160
We...

1550
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:01,530
are a team, right?

1551
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:03,320
Well!

1552
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:06,280
Nami!

1553
01:45:07,530 --> 01:45:08,990
Team?

1554
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:11,910
What is the point of trust like that ?!

1555
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:15,110
Give it up!

1556
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:18,070
With this, the game over!

1557
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:20,110
Even so...

1558
01:45:20,530 --> 01:45:22,490
I believe in them!

1559
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:26,200
Tesoro!

1560
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:32,660
Remove your hand!

1561
01:45:40,450 --> 01:45:43,360
Laugh, Straw Hat!

1562
01:45:44,570 --> 01:45:48,410
He still believe you!

1563
01:45:49,950 --> 01:45:54,700
You've lost a bet with me!

1564
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:58,360
Your lives are mine!

1565
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:01,360
Everything on this ship is my slave!

1566
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:05,280
Everything is mine!

1567
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:12,360
You're the ... the kind of person I hate most!

1568
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:15,450
Remove your hand!

1569
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:25,280
I told you smile!

1570
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:29,320
I am free to do anything on my body!

1571
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:30,410
Nami!

1572
01:46:30,910 --> 01:46:33,610
Right, Calina ?!

1573
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:37,200
NAMI!

1574
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:45,570
ROBIN!

1575
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:48,410
Spider Net!

1576
01:47:07,910 --> 01:47:11,450
My friend is not yours!

1577
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:15,490
Gear Four!

1578
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:28,820
Gomu-Gomu no

1579
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:32,240
Kong Gun

1580
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:42,410
Great!

1581
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:46,070
Damn you!

1582
01:47:48,610 --> 01:47:51,070
I could not give up.

1583
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:57,240
You can't beat us.

1584
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:00,410
Robin-chan, are you hurt?

1585
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:02,170
No.

1586
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:03,380
Oh, I see.

1587
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:05,590
Forgive me.

1588
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:12,170
Diable Jamble

1589
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:22,380
Don't you dare to strike women!

1590
01:48:22,550 --> 01:48:24,170
Fucking animals!

1591
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:28,340
With this, it already end!

1592
01:48:30,550 --> 01:48:32,920
Sorry to keep you waiting!

1593
01:48:37,550 --> 01:48:41,010
Eh, what for you get back here?

1594
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:42,260
Usopp!

1595
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:45,880
Of course. I will help my friend!

1596
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:48,470
You sure can fight me?

1597
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,220
Success!

1598
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:53,590
Why...

1599
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,220
I can be defeated ...

1600
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,510
Probably ...

1601
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:07,510
You're great. The lucky lady!

1602
01:49:07,510 --> 01:49:09,840
It's a miracle!

1603
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:13,130
Jackpot?!

1604
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:28,300
Only then, I will not lose!

1605
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:33,260
Kokujo O Tatsumaki

1606
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:39,880
Do not tell me!

1607
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:45,090
Kokuton

1608
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,510
Shi Shi Sonson

1609
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:59,760
What's up with that joy?

1610
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:03,220
What voice is exhausted?

1611
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:10,970
Impossible!

1612
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:14,050
The executives have been defeated!

1613
01:50:15,970 --> 01:50:17,630
F-Flee! '

1614
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:20,010
Gran Tesoro is over!

1615
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:22,300
All the money was gone!

1616
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:31,550
My children ...

1617
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:33,840
Where did you want to run?

1618
01:50:45,010 --> 01:50:45,840
What is this?

1619
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:46,720
What?

1620
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:47,760
Nami!

1621
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:49,760
Franky!

1622
01:50:58,260 --> 01:50:59,510
Look!

1623
01:50:59,970 --> 01:51:03,760
How beautiful this gold!

1624
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:10,010
I will conquer it all

1625
01:51:12,390 --> 01:51:13,850
We're going to drown!

1626
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:18,010
I will make all witnessed it.

1627
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:22,010
My dream is to create joy,

1628
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:28,100
freedom and fortune ... into despair!

1629
01:51:32,350 --> 01:51:34,800
Tesoro!

1630
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,970
Nice!

1631
01:51:35,970 --> 01:51:38,390
Angry, Straw Hat!

1632
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,010
Something that you protect,

1633
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:43,050
something that is valuable to you,

1634
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:45,720
will be under my control!

1635
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:49,430
Such is the world.

1636
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:54,550
Everything is made of gold.

1637
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,140
In that case...

1638
01:51:56,470 --> 01:51:59,260
I'll beat you!

1639
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:11,600
Gomu-Gomu no

1640
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:17,760
Leo Rex Bazooka

1641
01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:26,760
How? I am a god!

1642
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:33,510
Gold Sprash!

1643
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:45,180
What's so being god!

1644
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:48,720
You're the only animals!

1645
01:52:53,970 --> 01:52:55,760
Warghh!

1646
01:52:55,760 --> 01:53:00,640
I am a person who will become the Pirate King!

1647
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:15,220
I am very happy.

1648
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:17,260
It is time

1649
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,370
vicious

1650
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,100
Great.

1651
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:28,970
Straw Hats brat!

1652
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:30,720
Successfully ...

1653
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:34,390
Tesoro defeated!

1654
01:53:47,890 --> 01:53:48,850
This...

1655
01:53:49,470 --> 01:53:50,760
Tesoro!

1656
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:55,600
So shocked, huh.

1657
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:58,890
I thought he was a god descending from the sky.

1658
01:54:00,350 --> 01:54:02,740
This man is . . .

1659
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:04,950
a beast!

1660
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:08,200
Bring Tesoro!

1661
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:16,200
Luffy!

1662
01:54:17,490 --> 01:54:18,830
What sound is that?

1663
01:54:23,950 --> 01:54:25,240
What's that!

1664
01:54:25,950 --> 01:54:28,370
Everything, quickly leave this place!

1665
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:32,160
Tesoro intends to drown his ship!

1666
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:36,410
Everything, quickly went to the ship!

1667
01:54:36,990 --> 01:54:38,830
There's no way out!

1668
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:43,660
Go, hurry!

1669
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:45,080
Robot!

1670
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:46,450
Quick!

1671
01:54:46,830 --> 01:54:47,910
Carina too!

1672
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:49,990
You go ahead!

1673
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:54,660
I will stay on this ship.

1674
01:54:55,410 --> 01:54:58,370
If we all run together, the explosion will be faster.

1675
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:03,280
If I stay on this ship, I can be a little far to the explosion.

1676
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:04,950
What are you talking?

1677
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:09,870
They are good friends, yes.

1678
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:13,490
Struggling with you until the end makes me happy.

1679
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:15,080
Carina.

1680
01:55:18,030 --> 01:55:19,030
Franky?!

1681
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:21,280
I'm counting on.

1682
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:23,740
I understand.

1683
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:25,200
Carina!

1684
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:42,240
Hey, where is he ?!

1685
01:55:42,450 --> 01:55:44,370
Its about to explode!

1686
01:55:58,490 --> 01:56:00,120
What does it mean?

1687
01:56:03,370 --> 01:56:05,160
Why there are fireworks ?!

1688
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:08,120
There!

1689
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:15,080
Captain Carina go first!

1690
01:56:15,450 --> 01:56:18,280
He ... Teases us!

1691
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:21,080
He steals his ship!

1692
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:25,490
The main objective he want is gold, huh.

1693
01:56:25,660 --> 01:56:28,490
We've used him.

1694
01:56:28,910 --> 01:56:32,280
Oh, so we're being lied to, huh?

1695
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:38,410
Navy's shooting at us!

1696
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:40,740
Yosh, All of it!

1697
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:42,580
Let's go!

1698
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:47,530
What is this?!

1699
01:56:51,330 --> 01:56:52,990
Wolf Burglar!
