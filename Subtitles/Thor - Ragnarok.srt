3
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,537
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

4
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,975
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

5
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,277
Well, sometimes
you have to get captured

6
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,079
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

7
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,313
It's a long story,

8
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:09,285
but basically,
I'm a bit of a hero.

9
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:13,453
See, I spent some time
on Earth...

10
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:14,754
fought some robots,

11
00:01:14,756 --> 00:01:16,757
saved the planet
a couple of times.

12
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,558
Then I went searching
through the cosmos

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,296
for some magic, colorful
Infinity Stone things.

14
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:24,831
Didn't find any.

15
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,299
That's when I came across

16
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:29,003
a path of death
and destruction...

17
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,241
which led me all the way here
into this cage...

18
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,245
where I met you.

19
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,813
Hmm.

20
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:42,915
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?

21
00:01:56,831 --> 00:02:01,001
Thor, son of Odin.

22
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:04,570
Surtur, son of a bitch.

23
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:06,340
You're still alive.

24
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:10,043
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.

25
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:11,879
I cannot die.

26
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,814
Not until
I fulfill my destiny...

27
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:16,350
and lay waste to your home.

28
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,885
It's funny
you should mention that.

29
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,453
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.

30
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,790
Asgard up in flames,
falling to ruins.

31
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:24,357
And you, Surtur,

32
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,759
are at the center
of all of them.

33
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:29,762
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.

34
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:31,999
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.

35
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:34,601
Hang on.

36
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:37,603
I'll be back around shortly.

37
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:40,477
I really feel like we were
connecting there.

38
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:44,644
Okay, so Ragnarok.

39
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:46,512
Tell me about that.
Walk me through it.

40
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:48,648
My time has come.

41
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,885
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame...

42
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:54,755
I shall be restored
to my full might.

43
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,090
I will tower
over the mountains...

44
00:02:57,092 --> 00:02:59,892
and bury my sword
deep in Asgard's...

45
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:02,662
Oh, hang on.
Give it a second.

46
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:03,997
I swear I'm not even moving.

47
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,732
It's just doing this
on its own.

48
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:08,402
I'm really sorry.

49
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,036
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

50
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:13,874
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame...

51
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,510
and then you'll suddenly grow
as big as a house?

52
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:17,710
A mountain!

53
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:20,947
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

54
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,716
Odin is not on Asgard.

55
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:27,787
And your absence has left
the throne defenseless.

56
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:29,790
Okay, so where is it?
This crown?

57
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:33,126
This is my crown,
the source of my power.

58
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:34,962
Oh, that's a crown.

59
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,763
I thought it was
a big eyebrow.

60
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:37,999
It's a crown.

61
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:41,768
Anyway, it sounds like all I
have to do to stop Ragnarok...

62
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,771
is rip that thing
off your head.

63
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:47,573
But Ragnarok
has already begun.

64
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:49,609
You cannot stop it.

65
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,189
I am Asgard's doom,
and so are you.

66
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:05,993
All will suffer,
all will burn.

67
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,894
Oh, that's intense.

68
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:09,897
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big...

69
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:12,965
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.

70
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:15,501
But it looks like I'm gonna
have to choose option B...

71
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:17,438
where I bust
out of these chains...

72
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,106
knock that tiara
off your head,

73
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,474
and stash it away
in Asgard's vault.

74
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:24,577
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

75
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:25,945
Why fight it?

76
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:29,519
Because that's what heroes do.

77
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:34,488
Hmm.

78
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,789
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.

79
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,192
Hmm?

80
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,763
And, now!

81
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:48,034
You have made
a grave mistake, Odinson.

82
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:50,803
I make grave mistakes
all the time.

83
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,478
Everything seems
to work out.

84
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,476
Huh?

85
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,721
Heimdall, I know
it's been a while,

86
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,726
but I could really use
a fast exit.

87
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,661
Heimdall?

88
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:23,697
Heimdall was an idiot.

89
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,599
This job should have
made him rich.

90
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:28,135
Now, the job ain't easy...

91
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,202
but it does have
its benefits.

92
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:32,673
The Bifrost gives me
access to everything

93
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:34,741
the Nine Realms
has to offer.

94
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:36,980
I mean it's all mine
for the taking.

95
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,716
Behold...

96
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,317
my stuff.

97
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,118
Ooh.

98
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I'm particularly fond
of these.

99
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:50,890
I pulled them out of a place
on Midgard called Texas.

100
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:54,995
I even named them.
Des and Troy.

101
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,100
You see, when you
put them together...

102
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,302
they destroy.

103
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:20,289
Heimdall, come on.

104
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:41,408
Stay!

105
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:46,779
Heimdall? I'm running
short on options.

106
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:49,015
<i>Heimdall?</i>

107
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,784
Um... Skurge?

108
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,291
Is that important?

109
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:04,099
You girls
are in for a treat.

110
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,186
Girls!

111
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:04,057
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.

112
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:06,092
Thanks for scaring away
my company

113
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:07,994
and drenching my
workplace in brains.

114
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:08,861
Who are you?

115
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,963
Don't you remember?
I'm Skurge.

116
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:12,365
We fought together
on Vanaheim.

117
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,168
Right. Where is Heimdall?

118
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,041
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

119
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:19,872
Traitor?

120
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:21,241
Yeah. Well, you see,
Odin charged Heimdall

121
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:22,476
with negligence of duty...

122
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,745
but he disappeared
before the trial.

123
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:25,846
Hard to catch a guy

124
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:26,980
who can see everything
in the universe.

125
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:28,015
Sure.

126
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:30,784
Hold on. I'm supposed
to announce your arrival.

127
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,712
What the hell is that?

128
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:07,187
Oh, brother.
This is it.

129
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,289
I take my leave.

130
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,524
You fool,
you didn't listen!

131
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:12,893
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:14,059
Lady Sif, get help!

133
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:15,995
Somebody, help!

134
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,429
Sorry
for all I've done.

135
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,432
Shh. It's all right.
Hold on.

136
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:23,068
I'm sorry
I tried to rule Earth.

137
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,471
They'd be lucky to have you.

138
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:27,808
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

139
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,442
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.

140
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:30,943
I'm a trickster.

141
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:33,045
So mischievous.

142
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:35,848
Sorry about that time
I turned you into a frog.

143
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,384
It was a wonderful joke.

144
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,553
'Twas indeed hilarious.

145
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,054
You are the savior
of Asgard.

146
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:44,057
- Tell my story.
- I will.

147
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,391
Build a statue for me.

148
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:47,293
We will build
a big statue for you.

149
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:51,130
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.

150
00:10:51,132 --> 00:10:53,866
I will tell Father
what you did here today.

151
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:56,101
I didn't do it for him.

152
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:59,108
I didn't do it for him.

153
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:10,049
No!

154
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:16,456
And so,
Loki died of his wounds...

155
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,524
giving his life for ours.

156
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:21,394
He fought back
those disgusting elves...

157
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:23,362
he brought peace to the realm.

158
00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:26,332
Loki, my boy...

159
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,134
'twas many moons ago
I found you

160
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:30,971
on that
frostbitten battlefield.

161
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:33,539
On that day,
I did not yet see in you...

162
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,109
Asgard's savior. No.

163
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:41,347
You were merely a little
blue baby icicle...

164
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:44,918
that melted
this old fool's heart.

165
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:49,492
Bravo! Bravo!
Well done. Bravo.

166
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:55,330
Father.

167
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:57,963
Oh, shit.

168
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:00,266
Uh, my son, Thor,
has returned!

169
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:03,436
Greetings, my boy.

170
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:05,304
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?

171
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:07,340
<i>The Tragedy
of Loki of Asgard.</i>

172
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:09,509
The people wanted
to commemorate him.

173
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,077
Ah, indeed they should.

174
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:12,278
I like the statue.

175
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,947
A lot better looking than he
was when he was alive, though.

176
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:16,853
A little less weaselly,
less greasy, maybe.

177
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:20,654
Do you know what this is?

178
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,957
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!

179
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:25,524
Do me a favor. Lock
this away in a vault...

180
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:27,293
so it doesn't turn
into a giant monster

181
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,897
and destroy
the whole planet.

182
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:32,097
Thank you, dear. Um...

183
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:35,135
So it's back to Midgard
for you, is it?

184
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,602
Nope.

185
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:39,471
I've been having this
reoccurring dream lately.

186
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:42,442
Every night, I see
Asgard fall into ruins.

187
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:43,677
That's just
a silly dream...

188
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,644
signs of an overactive
imagination.

189
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:46,745
Possibly.

190
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:49,182
But then I decide to go
out there and investigate.

191
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:50,317
And what do I find,

192
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:53,352
but the Nine Realms
completely in chaos.

193
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:56,456
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise...

194
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,124
all while you, Odin,

195
00:12:58,126 --> 00:12:59,525
the protector
of those Nine Realms...

196
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,293
are sitting here
in your bathrobe,

197
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:02,361
eating grapes.

198
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:04,997
Yes, it is best to respect
our neighbors' freedom.

199
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:08,003
Yes, of course, the
freedom to be massacred.

200
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:12,005
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.

201
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:13,005
Watching theater.

202
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:15,207
Board meetings, and security
council meetings...

203
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,375
You're really gonna
make me do it?

204
00:13:16,377 --> 00:13:17,379
Do what?

205
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:23,415
You know that nothing
will stop Mjolnir

206
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:25,184
as it returns to my hand.

207
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:26,686
Not even your face.

208
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:29,221
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

209
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:31,993
Then I'll see you on the
other side, brother.

210
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,530
All right, I yield.

211
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:45,608
Behold!

212
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:47,944
Thor...

213
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:50,078
- Odinson.
- No.

214
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:54,316
You had one job.
Just the one.

215
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:57,350
Where's Odin?

216
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:59,119
You just couldn't
stay away, could you?

217
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:01,321
Everything was fine
without you.

218
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:04,223
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

219
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:05,457
- Ask them.
- Where's Father?

220
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,192
- Did you kill him?
- You had what you wanted.

221
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:08,260
You had the independence
you asked for.

222
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:09,361
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

223
00:14:09,363 --> 00:14:11,633
Okay. I know exactly
where he is.

224
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:25,680
I swear I left him
right here.

225
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,548
Right here
on the sidewalk,

226
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,283
or right there where the
building is being demolished?

227
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,518
Great planning.

228
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,553
How was I
supposed to know?

229
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:34,420
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

230
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:36,755
No? Then why do you
dress like one?

231
00:14:36,757 --> 00:14:38,792
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.

232
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,460
I saw you die.

233
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,261
I mourned you,
I cried for you.

234
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:43,696
I'm honored.

235
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:44,630
Ask him.

236
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:46,698
Hi. Would you mind taking
a picture with us?

237
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,135
Oh, sure.

238
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:51,538
Start figuring out
where he is.

239
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,672
Oh, my God.

240
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,774
Sorry to hear
that Jane dumped you.

241
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:57,242
She didn't dump me,
you know.

242
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,180
I dumped her.
It was a mutual dumping.

243
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,283
What's this?
What are you doing?

244
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,350
This isn't me.

245
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:09,557
Loki.

246
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,618
Thor Odinson.

247
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:48,696
God of Thunder.

248
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:51,767
You can put down
the umbrella.

249
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:11,518
So, Earth has, uh,
wizards now?

250
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:18,424
The preferred term is

251
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:20,528
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.

252
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,196
All right, wizard.

253
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:24,664
Who are you?
Why should I care?

254
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,698
My name is
Doctor Stephen Strange,

255
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,901
and I have some
questions for you.

256
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:30,105
Take a seat.

257
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:36,244
Tea?

258
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,179
I don't drink tea.

259
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:41,481
What do you drink?

260
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:42,651
Not tea.

261
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:47,787
So, I keep a watch list

262
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,755
of individuals and beings
from other realms...

263
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:51,323
that may be a threat
to this world.

264
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:55,394
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

265
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:57,766
He's a worthy inclusion. Hmm.

266
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:01,567
Then why bring him here?

267
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:03,669
We're looking for my father.

268
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:06,972
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was...

269
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:09,576
all parties concerned would
promptly return to Asgard?

270
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:10,710
Promptly.

271
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:12,478
Great! Then I'll help you.

272
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,214
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

273
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:16,382
I have to tell you,
he was adamant

274
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:17,416
that he not be disturbed.

275
00:17:17,418 --> 00:17:20,819
Your father said he had
chosen to remain in exile.

276
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:24,423
- Hmm.
- And you don't have a phone.

277
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,259
No, I don't have a phone...

278
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:27,827
but you could have sent
an electronic letter.

279
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,229
It's called an email.

280
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:31,297
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?

281
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:32,965
- Uh-huh.
- Anyway,

282
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,866
my father
is no longer in exile.

283
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:36,568
So if you could
tell me where he is,

284
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,804
I can take him home.

285
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,472
Gladly. He's in Norway.

286
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:42,808
I'm just seeing
whether this incantation

287
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,915
requires any Asgardian
modifications.

288
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:47,716
Nope.

289
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:49,785
Oh, we don't need that.

290
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:57,193
Will you stop doing that?

291
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:02,327
I need just one strand
of your hair.

292
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:03,229
Let me explain something.

293
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:05,768
My hair is not to be
meddled with.

294
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:14,976
We could have just walked.

295
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:19,679
He's waiting for you.

296
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,980
All right.

297
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:22,682
Don't forget your umbrella.

298
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,883
Oh, yes.

299
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:32,727
Sorry.

300
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:37,763
There we go.

301
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:40,465
I suppose I'll need
my brother back.

302
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,869
Oh, yeah. Right.

303
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:51,411
I have been falling
for 30 minutes!

304
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:52,615
You can handle him
from here.

305
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,314
Yes. Of course.

306
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:55,748
Thank you very much
for your help.

307
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,883
Good luck.

308
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,954
Handle me?
Who are you?

309
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,753
Loki.

310
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:01,887
You think you're
some kind of sorcerer?

311
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:03,990
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

312
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,058
Bye-bye.

313
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:31,753
Father?

314
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:36,391
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

315
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:42,865
Father, it's us.

316
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:47,770
My sons.

317
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:50,502
I've been
waiting for you.

318
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:52,006
I know. We've come
to take you home.

319
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,809
Home, yes.

320
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:57,980
Your mother,
she calls me.

321
00:20:00,381 --> 00:20:01,382
Do you hear it?

322
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:04,852
Loki, lift your magic.

323
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:10,423
Took me quite a while to
break free from your spell.

324
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:11,958
Frigga would have
been proud.

325
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,720
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.

326
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,001
I know that
we failed you.

327
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:24,505
But we can make this right.

328
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,508
I failed you.

329
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:30,410
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

330
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:33,449
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

331
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:35,181
No.

332
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,453
It has already begun.
She's coming.

333
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,853
My life was all that
held her back.

334
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:42,091
But my time has come.

335
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,893
I cannot keep her away
any longer.

336
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:49,095
Father, who are you
talking about?

337
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:52,033
Goddess of Death. Hela.

338
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,736
My firstborn.

339
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,839
Your sister.

340
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:01,709
Your what?

341
00:21:04,078 --> 00:21:08,079
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

342
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:11,483
I couldn't stop her,
so I imprisoned her.

343
00:21:11,485 --> 00:21:13,653
Locked her away.

344
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:17,923
She draws her strength
from Asgard...

345
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:22,094
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.

346
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:24,596
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.
We can face her together.

347
00:21:24,598 --> 00:21:25,600
No, we won't.

348
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:28,968
I'm on a different path now.

349
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,539
This you must face alone.

350
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:34,610
I love you, my sons.

351
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:38,781
Look at that.

352
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:44,453
Remember this place.

353
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,489
Home.

354
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,229
Brother.

355
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:38,973
This was your doing.

356
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:22,684
So he's gone.

357
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,055
That's a shame. I would've
liked to have seen that.

358
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,692
You must be Hela.

359
00:23:32,225 --> 00:23:33,925
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

360
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:37,762
Really?
You don't look like him.

361
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,699
Perhaps we can come
to an arrangement.

362
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:41,603
You sound like him.

363
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:44,804
Kneel.

364
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:46,074
Beg your pardon?

365
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,980
Kneel.

366
00:23:55,148 --> 00:23:56,952
Before your queen.

367
00:23:58,185 --> 00:23:59,687
I don't think so.

368
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:13,665
It's not possible.

369
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:17,204
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.

370
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:38,423
Bring us back!

371
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:39,694
No!

372
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:49,771
Loki!

373
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,490
Who are you? What have
you done with Thor?

374
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:44,792
I'm Hela.

375
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:50,061
I'm just a janitor.

376
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:53,200
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

377
00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:58,005
How would you like a job?

378
00:28:09,337 --> 00:28:11,636
Are you a fighter?

379
00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:13,571
Or are you food?

380
00:28:13,573 --> 00:28:15,941
I'm just passing through.

381
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:17,408
It is food.

382
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,512
On your knees.

383
00:29:01,254 --> 00:29:02,890
He's mine.

384
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,168
Wait!

385
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:23,178
Wait!

386
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:26,577
He's mine.

387
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:30,081
So if you want him,
you go through me.

388
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,418
But we've already
got him.

389
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:36,555
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.

390
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:38,126
More food.

391
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:14,628
Thank you.

392
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:54,133
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

393
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:56,100
I've got something special.

394
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:58,372
Hey! Where are you
taking me?

395
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,076
Answer me!

396
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:02,473
Hey!

397
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:06,377
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.

398
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:08,680
Many apologies, your majesty.

399
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:40,781
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

400
00:31:47,754 --> 00:31:51,522
I am Hela,
Odin's firstborn...

401
00:31:51,524 --> 00:31:54,158
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard...

402
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,727
the rightful heir
to the throne,

403
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:57,766
and the Goddess of Death.

404
00:32:02,102 --> 00:32:04,735
My father is dead.

405
00:32:04,737 --> 00:32:07,338
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

406
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,673
We were once the seat

407
00:32:08,675 --> 00:32:10,843
of absolute power
in the cosmos.

408
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,311
Our supremacy
was unchallenged.

409
00:32:13,313 --> 00:32:16,514
Yet Odin stopped
at Nine Realms.

410
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:20,054
Our destiny is
to rule over all others.

411
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:24,224
And I am here
to restore that power.

412
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,158
Kneel before me...

413
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,198
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

414
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,433
Whoever you are...

415
00:32:34,435 --> 00:32:37,568
whatever you've done,
surrender now!

416
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,872
Or we will show you
no mercy.

417
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,606
Whoever I am?

418
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:44,375
Did you listen
to a word I said?

419
00:32:44,377 --> 00:32:46,414
This is your
last warning!

420
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:50,785
I thought you'd be
happy to see me.

421
00:32:56,456 --> 00:32:57,691
Fine.

422
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:12,538
Charge!

423
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:09,494
Oh, I've missed this.

424
00:34:09,496 --> 00:34:11,429
Still, it's a shame.

425
00:34:11,431 --> 00:34:13,699
Good soldiers dying
for nothing...

426
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:16,268
all because they couldn't
see the future.

427
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,635
Sad.

428
00:34:17,637 --> 00:34:20,806
Oh, look, still alive.

429
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:30,282
Change of heart?

430
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:32,654
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.

431
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,489
You evil demoness!

432
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:41,462
Let's go see my palace.

433
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:14,661
<i>Fear not, for you are found.</i>

434
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,699
<i>You are home,
and there is no going back.</i>

435
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:24,335
<i>No one leaves this place.</i>

436
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,003
<i>But what is this place?</i>

437
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:29,474
<i>The answer is Sakaar.</i>

438
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:33,545
<i>Surrounded
by cosmic gateways...</i>

439
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:36,547
<i>Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.</i>

440
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:38,382
<i>It is the collection point</i>

441
00:35:38,384 --> 00:35:40,318
<i>for all lost
and unloved things...</i>

442
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,019
<i>like you.</i>

443
00:35:42,021 --> 00:35:44,956
<i>But here on Sakaar,
you are significant.</i>

444
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,692
<i>You are valuable.</i>

445
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:48,326
<i>Here you are loved.</i>

446
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:49,594
What the hell?

447
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:52,697
<i>And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.</i>

448
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:54,699
<i>He is the original,</i>

449
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:56,967
<i>the first lost
and the first found...</i>

450
00:35:56,969 --> 00:35:58,068
<i>the creator of Sakaar...</i>

451
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,773
<i>and father
of the Contest of Champions.</i>

452
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:06,344
<i>Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.</i>

453
00:36:06,346 --> 00:36:09,614
<i>You are the property
of the Grandmaster.</i>

454
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:11,116
<i>Congratulations!</i>

455
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:15,087
<i>You will meet the Grandmaster
in 5 seconds.</i>

456
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,590
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

457
00:36:18,491 --> 00:36:19,493
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

458
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:24,663
<i>You are now meeting
the Grandmaster.</i>

459
00:36:33,373 --> 00:36:34,873
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

460
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:39,777
He's wonderful.
It is a he?

461
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:41,012
It is a he.

462
00:36:41,014 --> 00:36:42,114
Yeah.

463
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,449
I love when you come
to visit, 142.

464
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:46,083
You bring me the best stuff.

465
00:36:46,085 --> 00:36:47,952
Whenever we get
to talking, Topaz,

466
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:49,855
about Scrapper 142...

467
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:51,456
what do I always say?

468
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,625
"She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."

469
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:54,661
Trash.

470
00:36:55,661 --> 00:36:58,396
No, not trash.

471
00:36:58,398 --> 00:36:59,797
Were you waiting
just to call her that?

472
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,565
It doesn't start
with a "B."

473
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:02,669
Booze hag.

474
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:07,806
Uh, I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."

475
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,106
'Cause I always say
you're the best.

476
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:11,175
She brought me my beloved
champion, you know.

477
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:13,144
You say that every time
she's here.

478
00:37:13,146 --> 00:37:14,586
What have you brought today?
Tell me.

479
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:15,980
A contender.

480
00:37:15,982 --> 00:37:17,081
A what?

481
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,518
I need to go closer.
I want a closer look at this.

482
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,652
Can you take us closer?
Thank you.

483
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:35,065
Pay this lady.

484
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:37,001
Just wait a damn minute.

485
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:39,603
I'm not for sale.

486
00:37:45,712 --> 00:37:47,579
Man, he's a fighter.

487
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:48,980
I take 10 million.

488
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:50,014
Tell her she's dreaming.

489
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:52,684
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
transfer the units.

490
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,925
You'll pay for this.

491
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:02,429
No, I got paid for this.

492
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:05,816
Here's what I wanna know.

493
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:08,532
Who are you?

494
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:13,103
I am the God of Thunder.

495
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:14,908
Wow.

496
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:17,208
I didn't hear any thunder,

497
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,077
but out of your fingers,
was that sparkles?

498
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,514
We've located your cousin.

499
00:38:22,516 --> 00:38:23,981
Uh, oh, good!

500
00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:26,251
Yeah, come on. I think
you're gonna like this.

501
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:27,518
There he is.

502
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,186
Hey, cuz.

503
00:38:29,188 --> 00:38:31,623
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

504
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,090
Hi.

505
00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:34,525
Hmm.

506
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:35,826
So...

507
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:37,628
Please.

508
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,197
I'm sorry.

509
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,664
Yeah.

510
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:41,869
Carlo...

511
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:44,268
I pardon you.

512
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,871
Oh, thank you.

513
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:47,172
Thank you.

514
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:50,141
You're officially pardoned.
From life.

515
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,050
Help me.

516
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,751
Oh, my God!

517
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:02,757
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!

518
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,056
Wow.

519
00:39:05,058 --> 00:39:07,058
Oh, the smell.

520
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,559
What does it smell like?

521
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:10,762
Burnt toast.

522
00:39:10,764 --> 00:39:12,831
What happened to my manners?

523
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,599
I haven't properly
introduced myself.

524
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,867
Come on.
Uh, follow me.

525
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:19,003
My name is Grandmaster.

526
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:20,804
I preside over
a little harlequinade

527
00:39:20,806 --> 00:39:22,673
called the
Contest of Champions.

528
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:23,942
People come
from far and wide

529
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,576
to unwillingly
participate in it.

530
00:39:25,578 --> 00:39:26,677
And you, my friend,

531
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:28,112
might just be part
of the new cast.

532
00:39:28,114 --> 00:39:29,414
What do you say to that?

533
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:31,750
We're not friends and I don't
give a shit about your games.

534
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:33,184
I'm going back to Asgard.

535
00:39:33,186 --> 00:39:36,087
Ass-gard.

536
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:38,226
One, two, three, four.

537
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:42,059
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.

538
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:45,563
At that moment,
I let go.

539
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:46,666
Loki?

540
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,800
Loki! Loki!

541
00:39:49,802 --> 00:39:53,170
Over here. Over here.

542
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:55,005
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!

543
00:39:56,576 --> 00:39:57,943
- What?
- You're alive?

544
00:39:57,945 --> 00:39:59,744
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?

545
00:39:59,746 --> 00:40:00,811
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

546
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,079
I'm stuck
in this stupid chair.

547
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:03,581
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.

548
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,916
- Get me out of this one.
- I can't.

549
00:40:04,918 --> 00:40:06,251
- Get me out. What?
- I can't.

550
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:07,318
I've made friends
with this man.

551
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,719
He's called
the Grandmaster.

552
00:40:08,721 --> 00:40:09,920
- Oh, he's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.

553
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:11,722
The Bifrost brought me
out here weeks ago.

554
00:40:11,724 --> 00:40:12,958
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.

555
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,925
I just got here.

556
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:15,226
What are you
whispering about?

557
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:18,262
Time works real different
around these parts.

558
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:21,632
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

559
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:23,201
But here on Sakaar...

560
00:40:28,674 --> 00:40:31,342
In any case,
you know this, uh...

561
00:40:31,344 --> 00:40:32,876
You call yourself
Lord of Thunder?

562
00:40:32,878 --> 00:40:35,280
God of Thunder.
Tell him.

563
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:37,148
I've never met this man
in my life.

564
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,983
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.

565
00:40:38,985 --> 00:40:40,184
Is he any kind of a fighter?

566
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:41,286
You take this thing

567
00:40:41,288 --> 00:40:42,286
out of my neck
and I'll show you.

568
00:40:42,288 --> 00:40:44,355
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

569
00:40:44,357 --> 00:40:46,657
Hey, Sparkles,
here's the deal.

570
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:48,960
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

571
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:49,894
Asgard.

572
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:53,130
Any contender who defeats
my champion...

573
00:40:53,132 --> 00:40:55,132
their freedom
they shall win.

574
00:40:55,134 --> 00:40:56,835
Fine. Then point me
in the direction

575
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:58,637
of whoever's ass
I have to kick!

576
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,206
That's what I call,
contender.

577
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,009
Direction would be
this way, Lord.

578
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:05,279
Ah! Loki!

579
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:14,152
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

580
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:16,054
Over here.

581
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,855
The pile of rocks
waving at you. Here.

582
00:41:17,857 --> 00:41:20,425
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

583
00:41:20,427 --> 00:41:22,159
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

584
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:23,827
I'm kind of like
the leader in here.

585
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,697
I'm made of rocks,
as you can see.

586
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:27,297
But don't let that
intimidate you.

587
00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:28,366
You don't need to be afraid

588
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:30,367
unless you're made of scissors.

589
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:31,769
Just a little
rock-paper-scissor

590
00:41:31,771 --> 00:41:32,936
joke for you.

591
00:41:32,938 --> 00:41:35,873
This is my very good friend
over here, Miek.

592
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:39,177
He's an insect
and has knives for hands.

593
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:40,878
You're a Kronan,
aren't you?

594
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,681
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?

595
00:41:43,683 --> 00:41:45,315
Ah, well, I tried to
start a revolution,

596
00:41:45,317 --> 00:41:46,784
but didn't print
enough pamphlets.

597
00:41:46,786 --> 00:41:48,152
So hardly anyone
turned up,

598
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:51,056
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

599
00:41:51,058 --> 00:41:52,389
As punishment,
I was forced

600
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:55,059
to be in here
and become a gladiator.

601
00:41:55,061 --> 00:41:56,760
Bit of a promotional
disaster, that one.

602
00:41:56,762 --> 00:41:59,463
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

603
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:00,731
I don't know
if you'd be interested

604
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:01,833
in something like that.

605
00:42:01,835 --> 00:42:03,670
Do you reckon
you'd be interested?

606
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:07,005
How did you...

607
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:09,907
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

608
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:13,177
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

609
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:14,411
This doesn't make
any sense.

610
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:16,047
No, nothing makes sense
here, man.

611
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:17,414
The only thing
that does make sense

612
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:19,184
is that nothing
makes sense.

613
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:21,786
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

614
00:42:21,788 --> 00:42:22,987
Doug has.

615
00:42:22,989 --> 00:42:24,121
Doug!

616
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:25,255
Our luck, Doug's dead.

617
00:42:25,257 --> 00:42:26,456
That's right.

618
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:29,059
Everyone who fights the
Grandmaster's champion perishes.

619
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:30,929
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

620
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:33,797
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

621
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:35,500
Yeah, no, I just do
the smaller fights,

622
00:42:35,502 --> 00:42:37,802
warm up the crowd
and whatnot.

623
00:42:37,804 --> 00:42:39,737
Wait. You're not gonna
face him, are you?

624
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:41,239
Yes, I am.

625
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:43,173
Gonna fight him, win,

626
00:42:43,175 --> 00:42:45,143
and get the hell out
of this place.

627
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,212
That's exactly
what Doug used to say.

628
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:49,849
See you later, new Doug.

629
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:01,259
Does no one remember me?

630
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:03,831
Has no one been taught
our history?

631
00:43:09,302 --> 00:43:11,436
Look at these lies.

632
00:43:11,438 --> 00:43:13,007
Goblets and garden parties?

633
00:43:15,174 --> 00:43:16,910
Peace treaties?

634
00:43:17,543 --> 00:43:19,076
Odin...

635
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:20,911
proud to have it...

636
00:43:20,913 --> 00:43:22,280
ashamed of how he got it.

637
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:43,967
We were unstoppable.

638
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:46,003
I was his weapon
in the conquest

639
00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:48,442
that built Asgard's empire.

640
00:43:51,244 --> 00:43:54,878
One by one,
the realms became ours.

641
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,184
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

642
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:04,121
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

643
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:07,090
Before that, Asgard's
warriors were honored...

644
00:44:07,092 --> 00:44:10,797
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

645
00:44:21,907 --> 00:44:23,543
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.

646
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:28,315
Most of the stuff in here
is fake.

647
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:30,150
Or weak.

648
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:34,221
Smaller than I thought
it would be.

649
00:44:35,288 --> 00:44:36,920
That's not bad.

650
00:44:36,922 --> 00:44:38,558
But this...

651
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:41,328
The Eternal Flame.

652
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,858
Want to see what true power
really looks like?

653
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:43,357
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?

654
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:49,996
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn.

655
00:46:05,478 --> 00:46:07,414
I've missed you.

656
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:10,217
I've missed you all.

657
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:14,152
Odin...

658
00:46:14,154 --> 00:46:17,588
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla...

659
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:20,094
where the brave
shall live forever.

660
00:46:21,427 --> 00:46:24,094
Nor shall we mourn
but rejoice...

661
00:46:24,096 --> 00:46:25,396
for those that have died...

662
00:46:25,398 --> 00:46:26,838
...the glorious death.

663
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,373
Hurts, doesn't it?

664
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:37,377
Being lied to.

665
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:39,744
Being told you're one thing

666
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:41,949
and then learning
it's all a fiction.

667
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:48,753
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

668
00:46:48,755 --> 00:46:50,557
This place is disgusting.

669
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:55,193
Does this mean
you don't want my help?

670
00:46:55,195 --> 00:46:57,327
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
position with the Grandmaster.

671
00:46:57,329 --> 00:46:59,097
It took me time
to win his trust.

672
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:00,431
He's a lunatic,
but he can be amenable.

673
00:47:00,433 --> 00:47:02,166
What I'm telling you is,

674
00:47:02,168 --> 00:47:03,768
you could join me
at the Grandmaster's side.

675
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,268
Perhaps, in time,

676
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:08,474
an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...

677
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:17,184
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

678
00:47:19,585 --> 00:47:22,387
Our sister destroyed
your hammer

679
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:24,588
like a piece of glass.

680
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,556
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.

681
00:47:26,558 --> 00:47:28,226
You don't stand a chance.

682
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:30,364
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

683
00:47:34,701 --> 00:47:35,701
Fine.

684
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:41,141
I guess I'll just
have to go it alone.

685
00:47:42,074 --> 00:47:43,076
Like I've always done.

686
00:47:46,078 --> 00:47:47,313
Would you say something?

687
00:47:50,049 --> 00:47:51,484
Say something!

688
00:47:52,585 --> 00:47:55,253
What would you
like me to say?

689
00:47:55,255 --> 00:47:57,554
You faked your own death...

690
00:47:57,556 --> 00:48:00,291
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power...

691
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:02,092
stranded him on Earth to die,

692
00:48:02,094 --> 00:48:04,128
releasing
the Goddess of Death.

693
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,496
Have I said enough or would
you like me to go back

694
00:48:05,498 --> 00:48:07,434
further than the past
two days?

695
00:48:09,134 --> 00:48:10,568
You know,
I haven't seen this

696
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,737
beloved champion
he talks of...

697
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:15,505
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.

698
00:48:15,507 --> 00:48:18,244
I've placed a large wager
against you tomorrow.

699
00:48:19,445 --> 00:48:20,547
Don't let me down.

700
00:48:24,516 --> 00:48:26,119
Piss off, ghost!

701
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:30,156
He's freaking gone.

702
00:48:38,465 --> 00:48:39,663
Oh, yuck!

703
00:48:39,665 --> 00:48:41,766
There's still someone's hair
and blood all over this.

704
00:48:41,768 --> 00:48:43,400
Guys, can you clean up
the weapons

705
00:48:43,402 --> 00:48:44,634
once you finish your fight?

706
00:48:44,636 --> 00:48:45,638
Disgusting slobs.

707
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:48,639
Oh, Thor...

708
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:50,644
wanna use
a big wooden fork?

709
00:48:51,143 --> 00:48:52,275
No.

710
00:48:52,277 --> 00:48:53,543
Yeah, not really useful.

711
00:48:53,545 --> 00:48:55,413
Unless you're fighting off
three vampires

712
00:48:55,415 --> 00:48:57,681
that were huddled together.

713
00:48:57,683 --> 00:48:59,717
I really wish
I had my hammer.

714
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:00,585
Hammer?

715
00:49:00,587 --> 00:49:02,619
Quite unique.
It was made from this

716
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:05,288
special metal from the heart
of a dying star.

717
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:06,690
And when I spun it really,
really fast,

718
00:49:06,692 --> 00:49:08,259
it gave me the ability to fly.

719
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:09,494
You rode a hammer?

720
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:11,262
No, I didn't
ride the hammer.

721
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:12,630
The hammer rode you
on your back?

722
00:49:12,632 --> 00:49:14,532
No. I used to spin it
really fast,

723
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,266
and it would pull me
off the...

724
00:49:16,268 --> 00:49:18,402
Oh, my God.
A hammer pulled you off?

725
00:49:18,404 --> 00:49:20,271
The ground. It would
pull me off the ground,

726
00:49:20,273 --> 00:49:22,306
up into the air,
and I would fly.

727
00:49:22,308 --> 00:49:23,407
Every time I threw it,

728
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:25,443
it would always
come back to me.

729
00:49:25,445 --> 00:49:26,710
Sounds like you had
a pretty special

730
00:49:26,712 --> 00:49:28,311
and intimate relationship
with this hammer...

731
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:29,246
and that losing it

732
00:49:29,248 --> 00:49:32,349
was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

733
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:34,520
That's a nice way
of putting it.

734
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:37,523
I said they're mine.

735
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,925
See her, that's the one
that put me in here.

736
00:49:40,927 --> 00:49:43,393
Oh, yeah. Scrapper 142.

737
00:49:43,395 --> 00:49:45,563
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.

738
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,431
They are hard to perish.

739
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:48,802
Asgardian?

740
00:49:50,436 --> 00:49:51,501
Hey.

741
00:49:51,503 --> 00:49:52,505
Hey.

742
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:54,704
Hey.

743
00:49:54,706 --> 00:49:57,243
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.

744
00:49:58,844 --> 00:50:00,379
Asgard is in danger.

745
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,419
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

746
00:50:07,786 --> 00:50:09,686
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger...

747
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:12,289
until I found out that
you were all women.

748
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:13,356
There's nothing wrong
with women, of course.

749
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:14,559
I love women.

750
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:16,326
Sometimes a little
too much.

751
00:50:16,328 --> 00:50:17,460
Not in a creepy way,

752
00:50:17,462 --> 00:50:19,463
just more of a
respectful appreciation.

753
00:50:19,465 --> 00:50:20,730
I think it's great
that there is

754
00:50:20,732 --> 00:50:23,967
an elite force
of women warriors.

755
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:25,571
It's about time.

756
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:28,206
Are you done?

757
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:29,340
Lord of Thunder,
you're up.

758
00:50:29,342 --> 00:50:30,474
Please, help me.
I need your help.

759
00:50:30,476 --> 00:50:31,474
Bye.

760
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:33,878
Fine, then you must be
a traitor or a coward.

761
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,913
Because the Valkyrie is sworn
to protect the throne.

762
00:50:36,915 --> 00:50:40,483
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

763
00:50:40,485 --> 00:50:42,355
And I'm a Scrapper,
not a Valkyrie.

764
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:47,657
Bring him in for processing.

765
00:50:47,659 --> 00:50:51,565
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.

766
00:51:03,476 --> 00:51:05,275
Now, don't you move.

767
00:51:05,277 --> 00:51:07,911
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.

768
00:51:07,913 --> 00:51:11,248
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair...

769
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,586
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.

770
00:51:17,924 --> 00:51:20,590
Please. Please, kind sir,
do not cut my hair.

771
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:23,360
Please! No!

772
00:51:23,362 --> 00:51:24,464
No!

773
00:51:36,643 --> 00:51:39,509
<i>Wow! Look at
all of you.</i>

774
00:51:39,511 --> 00:51:41,045
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

775
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:42,249
<i>Who's having fun?</i>

776
00:51:43,382 --> 00:51:45,483
<i>Please, I'm your host.</i>

777
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:46,684
<i>Big round of applause</i>

778
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,786
<i>for all of our
undercard competitors...</i>

779
00:51:48,788 --> 00:51:51,755
<i>who today died so gruesomely.</i>

780
00:51:51,757 --> 00:51:53,056
<i>Good sports.</i>

781
00:51:53,058 --> 00:51:55,759
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

782
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:59,298
<i>This is what you've come for,
and so have I.</i>

783
00:52:04,837 --> 00:52:07,972
<i>And now,
without further ado...</i>

784
00:52:07,974 --> 00:52:10,641
<i>it's main event time.</i>

785
00:52:12,344 --> 00:52:13,943
<i>Making his first appearance,</i>

786
00:52:13,945 --> 00:52:15,746
<i>though he looks
quite promising...</i>

787
00:52:15,748 --> 00:52:18,081
<i>got a couple of tricks
up his sleeve.</i>

788
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:20,918
<i>I'll say no more,
see what you think.</i>

789
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,389
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...</i>

790
00:52:23,523 --> 00:52:25,692
<i>Lord of Thunder.</i>

791
00:52:48,947 --> 00:52:51,849
<i>Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.</i>

792
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:53,184
<i>Okay, this is it.</i>

793
00:52:53,186 --> 00:52:56,654
<i>Let's get ready to welcome
this guy. Here he comes.</i>

794
00:53:04,896 --> 00:53:06,597
<i>He is a creature.</i>

795
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,498
<i>What can we say about him?</i>

796
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,534
<i>Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.</i>

797
00:53:10,536 --> 00:53:13,340
<i>I feel a special connection
with him.</i>

798
00:53:14,773 --> 00:53:15,976
<i>He's undefeated.</i>

799
00:53:17,643 --> 00:53:18,978
<i>He's the reigning.</i>

800
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,947
<i>He's the defending.</i>

801
00:53:23,949 --> 00:53:25,382
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

802
00:53:25,384 --> 00:53:26,419
<i>I give you...</i>

803
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:27,820
Uh-oh.

804
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:34,994
<i>...your Incredible...</i>

805
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:40,566
Hulk!

806
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:42,699
Yes!

807
00:53:46,572 --> 00:53:49,038
I have to get off
this planet.

808
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,141
Hey, hey, hey.
Where you going?

809
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:00,454
Hey!

810
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,786
We know each other.

811
00:54:02,788 --> 00:54:04,790
He's a friend from work.

812
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:15,599
Where have you been?

813
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:17,835
Everybody thought
you were dead.

814
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,840
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

815
00:54:20,672 --> 00:54:22,139
I lost my hammer.

816
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:25,509
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.

817
00:54:25,511 --> 00:54:27,911
Loki. Loki's alive.
Can you believe it?

818
00:54:27,913 --> 00:54:29,112
He's up there.

819
00:54:29,114 --> 00:54:31,150
Loki! Look who it is!

820
00:54:33,453 --> 00:54:35,719
Banner, I never thought
I would say this...

821
00:54:35,721 --> 00:54:38,054
but I'm happy to see you.

822
00:54:38,056 --> 00:54:40,659
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

823
00:54:46,465 --> 00:54:47,467
Banner.

824
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:50,233
Hey, Banner!

825
00:54:50,235 --> 00:54:52,837
No Banner. Only Hulk.

826
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:54,572
What are you doing?

827
00:54:54,574 --> 00:54:55,976
It's me. It's Thor!

828
00:55:16,128 --> 00:55:17,695
Banner, we're friends.

829
00:55:17,697 --> 00:55:19,257
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!

830
00:55:26,605 --> 00:55:28,641
Here we go.

831
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:48,628
What?

832
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:00,607
Hey, big guy.

833
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,511
The sun's getting
real low.

834
00:56:15,087 --> 00:56:17,991
That's it.
The sun's going down.

835
00:56:20,793 --> 00:56:22,893
I won't hurt you anymore.

836
00:56:22,895 --> 00:56:24,531
No one will.

837
00:56:36,174 --> 00:56:38,775
Yes! That's how it feels!

838
00:56:39,878 --> 00:56:42,012
I'm just a huge fan
of the sport.

839
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,858
All right. Screw it.

840
00:56:57,829 --> 00:56:58,931
Oh!

841
00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:04,735
I know you're
in there, Banner.

842
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:05,805
I'll get you out!

843
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,114
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

844
00:57:17,116 --> 00:57:18,284
I told them we were friends!

845
00:58:50,442 --> 00:58:52,711
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

846
00:58:54,346 --> 00:58:59,315
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

847
00:59:30,915 --> 00:59:33,751
Another day, another Doug.

848
00:59:42,393 --> 00:59:44,962
What is that noise?

849
00:59:44,964 --> 00:59:47,898
The common folk aren't
exactly falling in line.

850
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,738
There's a resistance trying to
knock down the front gates.

851
00:59:57,175 --> 00:59:59,208
Tell me about yourself,
Skurge.

852
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:01,978
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...

853
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,980
Right, yeah,
I'll just stop you there.

854
01:00:03,982 --> 01:00:06,016
What I meant was...

855
01:00:06,018 --> 01:00:07,721
what's your ambition?

856
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:12,157
I just want a chance
to prove myself.

857
01:00:12,824 --> 01:00:14,056
Recognition.

858
01:00:14,058 --> 01:00:15,492
When I was young...

859
01:00:15,494 --> 01:00:19,329
every great king
had an executioner.

860
01:00:19,331 --> 01:00:21,498
Not just to execute people...

861
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,170
but also to execute
their vision.

862
01:00:25,203 --> 01:00:28,172
But mainly
to execute people.

863
01:00:28,174 --> 01:00:30,175
Still, it was a great honor.

864
01:00:32,043 --> 01:00:34,880
I was Odin's executioner.

865
01:00:38,116 --> 01:00:40,152
And you shall be
my executioner.

866
01:00:45,523 --> 01:00:47,527
Let's begin our conquest.

867
01:00:59,038 --> 01:01:00,540
Skurge, where's the sword?

868
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:10,146
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

869
01:01:10,148 --> 01:01:11,614
Those people you mentioned,

870
01:01:11,616 --> 01:01:13,819
the ones who aren't
falling into line...

871
01:01:14,353 --> 01:01:15,521
round them up.

872
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:40,145
Excuse me.

873
01:01:52,891 --> 01:01:54,491
Sorry about that.

874
01:01:54,493 --> 01:01:55,895
These bloody things
are everywhere.

875
01:01:57,061 --> 01:01:58,130
Come on.

876
01:02:33,098 --> 01:02:34,634
You'll be safe here.

877
01:03:44,302 --> 01:03:45,501
Are we cool?

878
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,575
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

879
01:03:52,011 --> 01:03:53,478
So how long
have you been like that?

880
01:03:54,012 --> 01:03:56,045
Like what?

881
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:59,185
Like this. Big, and
green, and stupid.

882
01:04:00,284 --> 01:04:02,422
Hulk always Hulk.

883
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:08,460
How'd you get here?

884
01:04:09,293 --> 01:04:10,329
Winning.

885
01:04:11,163 --> 01:04:12,228
You mean cheating, huh?

886
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:14,630
Were they wearing one
of these when you won?

887
01:04:14,632 --> 01:04:16,333
How'd you arrive here?

888
01:04:19,038 --> 01:04:20,202
Quinjet.

889
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:22,674
Yes. Now,
where is the Quinjet now?

890
01:04:27,445 --> 01:04:29,579
That's naked.

891
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:32,452
He's very naked. Hmm.

892
01:04:35,154 --> 01:04:37,290
It's in my brain now.

893
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,192
Quinjet.

894
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:51,201
Yes!

895
01:04:51,203 --> 01:04:52,735
I'm getting us out of here.

896
01:04:52,737 --> 01:04:55,405
This is a terrible,
awful place.

897
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:59,309
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

898
01:04:59,311 --> 01:05:00,744
Hulk stay.

899
01:05:00,746 --> 01:05:04,847
No, no, no. My people need
me to get back to Asgard.

900
01:05:04,849 --> 01:05:06,817
We must prevent Ragnarok.

901
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,284
Ragnarok?

902
01:05:08,286 --> 01:05:10,320
The prophesied death
of my home world.

903
01:05:10,322 --> 01:05:11,682
The end of days,
it's the end of...

904
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:16,092
If you help me
get back to Asgard...

905
01:05:16,094 --> 01:05:18,360
I can help you
get back to Earth. Huh?

906
01:05:18,362 --> 01:05:19,496
Earth hate Hulk.

907
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:21,297
Earth loves Hulk.
They love you.

908
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:22,599
You're one of the Avengers.

909
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:24,601
One of the team,
one of our friends.

910
01:05:24,603 --> 01:05:26,536
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

911
01:05:26,538 --> 01:05:27,804
You're Banner's friend.

912
01:05:27,806 --> 01:05:30,306
I'm not Banner's friend.
I prefer you.

913
01:05:30,308 --> 01:05:31,440
Banner's friend.

914
01:05:31,442 --> 01:05:32,442
I don't even like Banner.

915
01:05:32,444 --> 01:05:35,712
"I'm into numbers
and science and stuff."

916
01:05:35,714 --> 01:05:37,614
Thor go. Hulk stay.

917
01:05:37,616 --> 01:05:38,618
Fine.

918
01:05:39,384 --> 01:05:40,384
Stay here.

919
01:05:41,786 --> 01:05:43,686
Stupid place.
It's hideous, by the way.

920
01:05:43,688 --> 01:05:47,259
The red, the white. Just pick a color.
Ridiculous.

921
01:05:47,893 --> 01:05:49,425
Smash you.

922
01:05:49,427 --> 01:05:51,795
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

923
01:05:51,797 --> 01:05:54,230
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.

924
01:05:54,232 --> 01:05:56,166
- Baby arms.
- What?

925
01:05:56,168 --> 01:05:57,367
Baby.

926
01:05:57,369 --> 01:05:59,135
Moron! You big child.

927
01:05:59,137 --> 01:06:00,269
Thor go!

928
01:06:00,271 --> 01:06:02,204
I am going.

929
01:06:06,177 --> 01:06:07,547
Thor go again.

930
01:06:12,284 --> 01:06:13,519
Thor home.

931
01:06:23,661 --> 01:06:25,462
Hulk trains.

932
01:06:25,464 --> 01:06:27,663
That's great.
Have fun.

933
01:06:27,665 --> 01:06:29,498
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.

934
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,867
What have you
been up to?

935
01:06:30,869 --> 01:06:31,934
Winning.

936
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:45,451
Heimdall, I know
you can see me.

937
01:06:46,717 --> 01:06:48,721
<i>I need you to help me.</i>

938
01:06:50,822 --> 01:06:52,291
Help me see.

939
01:07:02,433 --> 01:07:04,836
I see you,
but you're far away.

940
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:07,304
What's going on here?

941
01:07:07,306 --> 01:07:08,741
Come see for yourself.

942
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:12,842
I'm providing refuge
in a stronghold

943
01:07:12,844 --> 01:07:14,009
built by our ancestors.

944
01:07:14,011 --> 01:07:17,813
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

945
01:07:17,815 --> 01:07:19,916
You're talking
about evacuating Asgard?

946
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,621
We won't last long
if we stay.

947
01:07:25,623 --> 01:07:26,922
She draws her power
from Asgard

948
01:07:26,924 --> 01:07:28,491
and grows stronger
every day.

949
01:07:28,493 --> 01:07:29,594
Come on.

950
01:07:33,565 --> 01:07:35,297
Hela is ravenous.

951
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:36,366
If I let her leave,

952
01:07:36,368 --> 01:07:38,501
she'll consume Nine Realms
and all the cosmos.

953
01:07:38,503 --> 01:07:39,436
We need you.

954
01:07:39,438 --> 01:07:40,769
I'm working on it.
But I don't even know

955
01:07:40,771 --> 01:07:42,105
where the hell I am.

956
01:07:42,107 --> 01:07:44,541
You're on a planet surrounded by doorways.
Go through one.

957
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:46,479
- Which one?
- The big one.

958
01:08:15,607 --> 01:08:16,972
Thor sad.

959
01:08:16,974 --> 01:08:18,343
Shut up.

960
01:08:20,544 --> 01:08:22,280
Thor sad.

961
01:08:23,315 --> 01:08:25,481
I'm not sad, you idiot.

962
01:08:25,483 --> 01:08:27,419
- I'm pissed off!
- Oh.

963
01:08:28,053 --> 01:08:31,887
Angry. I lost my father.

964
01:08:31,889 --> 01:08:34,457
I lost my hammer.

965
01:08:34,459 --> 01:08:36,025
- You're not even listening.
- Whining and crying.

966
01:08:36,027 --> 01:08:37,694
Cry like baby.

967
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:39,365
Don't kick stuff.

968
01:08:40,598 --> 01:08:42,866
You're being
a really bad friend.

969
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:44,367
You bad friend!

970
01:08:44,369 --> 01:08:45,668
- You know what we call you?
- No.

971
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:47,636
We call you
the stupid Avenger.

972
01:08:47,638 --> 01:08:49,775
You're tiny Avenger!

973
01:08:52,343 --> 01:08:53,510
What, are you crazy?

974
01:08:53,512 --> 01:08:54,644
Yes.

975
01:08:54,646 --> 01:08:57,550
You know what?
Earth does hate you.

976
01:09:17,803 --> 01:09:19,772
No. Mmm-mmm.

977
01:09:22,374 --> 01:09:25,708
I'm sorry
I said those things.

978
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:26,975
You're not
the stupid Avenger.

979
01:09:26,977 --> 01:09:29,414
Nobody calls you
the stupid Avenger.

980
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,581
It's okay.

981
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:32,649
You just can't go around
throwing shields

982
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:34,050
at people.
Could have killed me.

983
01:09:34,052 --> 01:09:35,484
I know. I'm sorry.

984
01:09:35,486 --> 01:09:36,953
I just get so angry
all the time.

985
01:09:36,955 --> 01:09:39,389
Hulk always,
always angry.

986
01:09:39,391 --> 01:09:42,058
I know. We're the same,
you and I.

987
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,859
We're just a couple of
hot-headed fools.

988
01:09:43,861 --> 01:09:47,832
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire,
Thor like water.

989
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:50,667
We're kind of both
like fire.

990
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:52,672
But Hulk like real fire.

991
01:09:53,705 --> 01:09:56,105
Hulk like raging fire.

992
01:09:56,107 --> 01:09:58,574
Thor like smoldering fire.

993
01:10:00,911 --> 01:10:02,845
Hulk, I need you
to do something for me.

994
01:10:02,847 --> 01:10:03,848
Hmm?

995
01:10:09,454 --> 01:10:10,856
Angry girl.

996
01:10:18,129 --> 01:10:20,532
What's going on?
What are you...

997
01:10:29,574 --> 01:10:31,573
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell...

998
01:10:31,575 --> 01:10:32,908
when someone's hiding
all the way across

999
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:34,577
the universe and wants
to be left alone.

1000
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:37,083
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.

1001
01:10:37,883 --> 01:10:39,047
I need her to stay.

1002
01:10:39,049 --> 01:10:40,052
Stay?

1003
01:10:40,752 --> 01:10:41,853
Block.

1004
01:10:43,422 --> 01:10:44,456
Stay.

1005
01:10:45,156 --> 01:10:47,025
- Please.
- Please.

1006
01:10:49,794 --> 01:10:50,795
All right.

1007
01:10:52,931 --> 01:10:55,465
Here's the deal.

1008
01:10:55,467 --> 01:10:57,036
I'll listen to you...

1009
01:10:57,803 --> 01:10:59,105
till this is empty.

1010
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:03,006
Asgard is in danger
and people are dying.

1011
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:04,728
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

1012
01:11:05,075 --> 01:11:06,708
Wow.

1013
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,646
Finished. Bye.

1014
01:11:10,147 --> 01:11:11,650
Odin is dead.

1015
01:11:14,953 --> 01:11:17,987
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.

1016
01:11:17,989 --> 01:11:20,789
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.

1017
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,395
I'm going to stop her.

1018
01:11:22,994 --> 01:11:24,194
- Alone?
- Nope.

1019
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,828
I'm putting together a team.

1020
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:28,931
It's me, you,
and the big guy.

1021
01:11:28,933 --> 01:11:31,234
No. No team.
Only Hulk.

1022
01:11:31,236 --> 01:11:33,101
It's me and you.

1023
01:11:33,103 --> 01:11:34,537
I think it's only you.

1024
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:36,840
Wait. Just listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.

1025
01:11:36,842 --> 01:11:40,009
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

1026
01:11:40,011 --> 01:11:40,976
I'm not getting dragged into

1027
01:11:40,978 --> 01:11:42,878
another one of Odin's
family squabbles.

1028
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,814
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.

1029
01:11:44,816 --> 01:11:46,882
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.

1030
01:11:46,884 --> 01:11:48,117
When it grew
beyond Odin's control

1031
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:49,618
she massacred everyone
in the palace...

1032
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,554
and tried to seize the throne.

1033
01:11:51,556 --> 01:11:53,256
When she tried
to escape her banishment...

1034
01:11:53,258 --> 01:11:55,761
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.

1035
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,998
I only survived because...

1036
01:12:00,664 --> 01:12:02,064
Look, I already faced her once

1037
01:12:02,066 --> 01:12:04,100
back when I believed
in the throne...

1038
01:12:04,102 --> 01:12:05,801
and it cost me everything.

1039
01:12:05,803 --> 01:12:07,737
That's what's wrong
with Asgard.

1040
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:09,905
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

1041
01:12:09,907 --> 01:12:11,142
I agree.

1042
01:12:12,076 --> 01:12:13,976
Don't get familiar.

1043
01:12:13,978 --> 01:12:15,612
I agree.

1044
01:12:15,614 --> 01:12:17,145
That's why I turned down
the throne.

1045
01:12:17,147 --> 01:12:19,082
But this isn't
about the crown.

1046
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,582
This is about the people.

1047
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:22,719
They're dying
and they're your people, too.

1048
01:12:22,721 --> 01:12:23,923
Forget it.

1049
01:12:24,955 --> 01:12:26,588
I have.

1050
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:27,890
- Okay.
- Okay.

1051
01:12:27,892 --> 01:12:28,992
- Good. Great.
- Great.

1052
01:12:28,994 --> 01:12:30,260
Thank you.

1053
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:31,996
- For what?
- For this.

1054
01:12:33,764 --> 01:12:35,797
Didn't see that,
did you?

1055
01:12:37,067 --> 01:12:39,137
There... That's better.

1056
01:12:40,938 --> 01:12:42,872
You know, go ahead.

1057
01:12:42,874 --> 01:12:47,609
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.

1058
01:12:47,611 --> 01:12:49,045
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

1059
01:12:49,047 --> 01:12:50,215
But me...

1060
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:54,117
I choose to run
toward my problems

1061
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:55,588
and not away from them.

1062
01:12:56,655 --> 01:12:57,857
Because that's what...

1063
01:13:02,893 --> 01:13:04,996
Because that's what
heroes do.

1064

1065

1066

01:15:36,947 --> 01:15:38,381
What happened to your hair?

1105
01:15:38,383 --> 01:15:39,981
Some creepy old man
cut it off.

- Sokovia?

1110

Sokovia. Ultron.

01:17:00,397 --> 01:17:03,166
<i>Lord of Thunder
has stolen him away.</i>

1140
01:17:03,168 --> 01:17:05,771
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.

1141
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:07,370
Oh, no.

1142
01:17:09,273 --> 01:17:10,506
This is bad.

1143
01:17:10,508 --> 01:17:12,745
This is really, really bad.

1144
01:17:15,312 --> 01:17:19,347
Thor, I think
I'm freaking out.

1145
01:17:19,349 --> 01:17:20,349
No, no, no.

1146
01:17:20,351 --> 01:17:22,585
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.

1147
01:17:22,587 --> 01:17:23,953
These are Tony's clothes.

1148
01:17:23,955 --> 01:17:25,220
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?

1149
01:17:25,222 --> 01:17:27,355
No, he's not here. But listen.
Just stay calm, okay?

1150
01:17:27,357 --> 01:17:29,492
The sun's going down.
The sun's getting really low.

1151
01:17:29,494 --> 01:17:30,795
Sun's going down.

1152
01:17:38,335 --> 01:17:40,239
I'm upset!

1153
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,274
I'm very upset.

1154
01:17:45,276 --> 01:17:47,475
You know what I like about being upset?
The blame.

1155
01:17:47,477 --> 01:17:49,845
Right now, that's
the mindset that I'm in.

1156
01:17:49,847 --> 01:17:51,113
And you know
who I'm blaming?

1157
01:17:51,115 --> 01:17:52,614
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!

1158
01:17:52,616 --> 01:17:53,983
Don't interrupt me!

1159
01:17:53,985 --> 01:17:55,618
Here you go.

1160
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,286
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?

1161
01:17:57,288 --> 01:17:59,287
He was interrupting.

1162
01:17:59,289 --> 01:18:01,224
That's not
a capital violation.

1163
01:18:01,226 --> 01:18:03,024
Where was I?

1164
01:18:03,026 --> 01:18:05,528
My precious champion
has come up missing...

1165
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:07,563
and it's all because
of that Lord of Thunder.

1166
01:18:07,565 --> 01:18:10,131
It's all because of him.
Your brother.

1167
01:18:10,133 --> 01:18:13,202
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated.

1168
01:18:13,204 --> 01:18:14,336
I'm sure
there's a big history.

1169
01:18:14,338 --> 01:18:15,473
And your contender...

1170
01:18:16,307 --> 01:18:17,439
My dear friend...

1171
01:18:17,441 --> 01:18:19,408
if you were to give me
12 hours,

1172
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:21,010
I could bring them both
back to you. Alive.

1173
01:18:21,012 --> 01:18:22,414
I could do it in two.

1174
01:18:23,313 --> 01:18:24,512
I could do it in one.

1175
01:18:24,514 --> 01:18:25,881
Let's stop there.

1176
01:18:25,883 --> 01:18:27,582
You know what?
I woke up this morning

1177
01:18:27,584 --> 01:18:30,386
thinking about
a public execution.

1178
01:18:30,388 --> 01:18:31,621
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

1179
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:34,459
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1180
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:38,130
So, you're on the clock.

1181
01:18:40,063 --> 01:18:41,229
What have you done?

1182
01:18:41,231 --> 01:18:42,597
I don't answer
to you, lackey.

1183
01:18:42,599 --> 01:18:43,466
It's Loki.

1184
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:45,404
And you will answer
to the Grandmaster.

1185
01:18:46,437 --> 01:18:48,470
Hmm.

1186
01:18:48,472 --> 01:18:51,539
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

1187
01:18:51,541 --> 01:18:53,044
I don't help anyone.

1188
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:00,552
You're a Valkyrie.

1189
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:07,860
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

1190
01:19:08,993 --> 01:19:10,693
Choose your next words wisely.

1191
01:19:10,695 --> 01:19:14,132
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

1192
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:09,321
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1193
01:20:10,455 --> 01:20:11,720
The sun's going down.

1194
01:20:11,722 --> 01:20:13,521
- It's getting real low.
- Oh, shoot.

1195
01:20:13,523 --> 01:20:15,757
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?

1196
01:20:15,759 --> 01:20:17,225
I just need you
to stay calm.

1197
01:20:17,227 --> 01:20:19,295
Calm? I'm on
an alien planet!

1198
01:20:19,297 --> 01:20:21,229
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

1199
01:20:21,231 --> 01:20:22,331
Yeah. One.

1200
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:24,233
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1201
01:20:24,235 --> 01:20:25,533
It's a new experience.

1202
01:20:25,535 --> 01:20:27,536
My neurons,
they're firing faster

1203
01:20:27,538 --> 01:20:29,738
than my brain can handle
the information.

1204
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:32,274
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1205
01:20:32,276 --> 01:20:34,143
In the past, I always felt
like Hulk and I

1206
01:20:34,145 --> 01:20:35,644
each had a hand on the wheel.

1207
01:20:35,646 --> 01:20:37,479
But this time,
it's like he had the keys

1208
01:20:37,481 --> 01:20:39,314
to the car and I was
locked in the trunk.

1209
01:20:39,316 --> 01:20:41,317
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.

1210
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:42,518
No, it's not what matters.

1211
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,618
What I'm trying
to tell you, is that

1212
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:45,453
if I turn into
the Hulk again...

1213
01:20:45,455 --> 01:20:47,189
Banner may never come back.

1214
01:20:47,191 --> 01:20:48,457
And we're stranded
on a planet

1215
01:20:48,459 --> 01:20:50,559
that is designed
to stress me out.

1216
01:20:50,561 --> 01:20:51,560
We're not stranded.

1217
01:20:51,562 --> 01:20:53,496
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get us home.

1218
01:20:53,498 --> 01:20:54,630
Thank you.

1219
01:20:54,632 --> 01:20:57,132
Not your home, though.
Asgard. My home.

1220
01:20:57,134 --> 01:20:58,300
What?

1221
01:20:58,302 --> 01:21:00,469
Listen, my people
are in great danger.

1222
01:21:00,471 --> 01:21:02,805
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

1223
01:21:02,807 --> 01:21:04,806
who also happens
to be my sister.

1224
01:21:04,808 --> 01:21:06,708
Okay, that is so wrong
on so many...

1225
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:08,077
I don't wanna
fight your sister.

1226
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:09,444
That's a family issue.

1227
01:21:09,446 --> 01:21:11,079
No, she's an evil being.

1228
01:21:11,081 --> 01:21:12,515
I don't care what she is.

1229
01:21:12,517 --> 01:21:15,117
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.

1230
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:16,318
- What?
- I just told you.

1231
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,787
If I turn into the Hulk,

1232
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:19,287
I am never gonna
come back again.

1233
01:21:19,289 --> 01:21:20,456
And you don't care.

1234
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,425
No, no. I'm putting
together the team.

1235
01:21:22,427 --> 01:21:23,826
The Hulk is the fire.

1236
01:21:23,828 --> 01:21:25,761
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1237
01:21:25,763 --> 01:21:27,529
- What? No!
- It's gross.

1238
01:21:27,531 --> 01:21:29,465
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1239
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:31,332
No! I don't even
like the Hulk.

1240
01:21:31,334 --> 01:21:32,667
He's all like...

1241
01:21:32,669 --> 01:21:34,403
"Smash, smash, smash."

1242
01:21:34,405 --> 01:21:35,574
I prefer you.

1243
01:21:36,406 --> 01:21:38,207
Thanks.

1244
01:21:38,209 --> 01:21:39,707
But if I'm being honest,

1245
01:21:39,709 --> 01:21:41,409
when it comes
to fighting evil beings...

1246
01:21:41,411 --> 01:21:43,078
he is very powerful
and useful.

1247
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,180
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

1248
01:21:45,182 --> 01:21:46,414
Is he though?

1249
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:48,650
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

1250
01:21:48,652 --> 01:21:51,386
How many PhDs does
Banner have? Seven.

1251
01:21:51,388 --> 01:21:53,521
Fine, you don't have
to fight anyone.

1252
01:21:53,523 --> 01:21:55,494
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1253
01:21:59,429 --> 01:22:00,628
What are you doing with that?

1254
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:01,764
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

1255
01:22:01,766 --> 01:22:04,300
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.

1256
01:22:04,302 --> 01:22:06,202
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

1257
01:22:06,204 --> 01:22:08,136
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1258
01:22:08,138 --> 01:22:10,639
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1259
01:22:10,641 --> 01:22:12,207
Then why did you
dress me up like Tony?

1260
01:22:12,209 --> 01:22:13,341
Because you were naked.

1261
01:22:13,343 --> 01:22:15,377
Okay, I'll give you that.

1262
01:22:15,379 --> 01:22:16,612
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1263
01:22:16,614 --> 01:22:18,247
Tony wears his pants
super tight.

1264
01:22:18,249 --> 01:22:19,515
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

1265
01:22:19,517 --> 01:22:21,649
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.

1266
01:22:21,651 --> 01:22:24,252
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

1267
01:22:24,254 --> 01:22:26,855
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

1268
01:22:26,857 --> 01:22:28,724
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

1269
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:31,359
You're good. Calm down.
Come on.

1270
01:22:31,361 --> 01:22:32,862
Listen, we're gonna
go to Asgard...

1271
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:34,130
and you're not gonna
have to think about

1272
01:22:34,132 --> 01:22:35,497
the Hulk ever again.

1273
01:22:35,499 --> 01:22:36,631
- All right?
- All right.

1274
01:22:40,404 --> 01:22:42,139
Hulk!

1275
01:22:43,907 --> 01:22:45,643
Oh. This is bad.

1276
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,215
Banner! Banner!

1277
01:22:55,218 --> 01:22:56,320
Banner!

1278
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:11,136
Banner!

1279
01:23:11,468 --> 01:23:12,636
Thor!

1280
01:23:24,182 --> 01:23:25,280
Hi.

1281
01:23:25,282 --> 01:23:26,414
Hi.

1282
01:23:26,416 --> 01:23:27,716
I was gonna do that.

1283
01:23:27,718 --> 01:23:29,284
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1284
01:23:29,286 --> 01:23:32,188
That's good.
What are you doing here?

1285
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:33,822
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

1286
01:23:33,824 --> 01:23:35,457
I got sidetracked.

1287
01:23:35,459 --> 01:23:36,725
What's with the...

1288
01:23:36,727 --> 01:23:38,260
It's my disguise.

1289
01:23:38,262 --> 01:23:39,595
But I can see your face.

1290
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:41,896
Not when I do this,
you can't.

1291
01:23:41,898 --> 01:23:43,765
Your hair looks nice.
I like what you did with it.

1292
01:23:43,767 --> 01:23:45,469
Change it?
Washed it maybe?

1293
01:23:51,441 --> 01:23:52,741
What are those
things on her eyes?

1294
01:23:52,743 --> 01:23:54,409
Are those the people
that she's killed?

1295
01:23:54,411 --> 01:23:55,877
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.

1296
01:23:55,879 --> 01:23:57,212
Who is this guy?

1297
01:23:57,214 --> 01:23:58,346
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?

1298
01:23:58,348 --> 01:23:59,814
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.

1299
01:23:59,816 --> 01:24:02,186
I feel like
I know you, too.

1300
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:08,457
Look, I've spent years
in a haze,

1301
01:24:08,459 --> 01:24:09,925
- trying to forget my past.
- Mmm.

1302
01:24:09,927 --> 01:24:11,426
Sakaar seemed like
the best place

1303
01:24:11,428 --> 01:24:13,828
to drink and forget,
and to die one day.

1304
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:15,764
I was thinking
that you drink too much,

1305
01:24:15,766 --> 01:24:17,399
and that probably
was gonna kill you.

1306
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:18,801
I don't plan
to stop drinking.

1307
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:20,868
- Oh.
- But I don't wanna forget.

1308
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:22,574
I can't turn away anymore...

1309
01:24:23,607 --> 01:24:25,573
so if I'm gonna die...

1310
01:24:25,575 --> 01:24:27,309
well, it may as well be
driving my sword

1311
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:28,844
through the heart
of that murderous hag.

1312
01:24:28,846 --> 01:24:30,645
- Good.
- Yeah.

1313
01:24:30,647 --> 01:24:33,651
So, I'm saying that
I wanna be on the team.

1314
01:24:34,317 --> 01:24:35,650
Has it got a name?

1315
01:24:35,652 --> 01:24:38,621
Yeah, it's called
the Revengers.

1316
01:24:38,623 --> 01:24:39,756
Revengers?

1317
01:24:39,758 --> 01:24:42,360
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

1318
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,527
Do you want revenge?

1319
01:24:45,529 --> 01:24:47,863
I'm undecided.

1320
01:24:47,865 --> 01:24:49,530
Okay.

1321
01:24:49,532 --> 01:24:51,402
Also, I've got
a peace offering.

1322
01:24:54,605 --> 01:24:56,607
Surprise.

1323
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,545
Ow.

1324
01:25:03,547 --> 01:25:04,915
Just had to be sure.

1325
01:25:08,619 --> 01:25:09,754
Hello, Bruce.

1326
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:12,988
So, last time I saw you,

1327
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:14,422
you were trying
to kill everybody.

1328
01:25:14,424 --> 01:25:15,957
Where are you at
these days?

1329
01:25:15,959 --> 01:25:17,861
It varies
from moment to moment.

1330
01:25:18,928 --> 01:25:20,695
Is that a Dragonfang?

1331
01:25:20,697 --> 01:25:21,896
It is.

1332
01:25:21,898 --> 01:25:23,931
My God.

1333
01:25:23,933 --> 01:25:26,635
This is the famed sword
of the Valkyrie.

1334
01:25:26,637 --> 01:25:28,369
Sakaar and Asgard
are about as far apart

1335
01:25:28,371 --> 01:25:29,470
as any two known systems.

1336
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:32,474
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

1337
01:25:32,476 --> 01:25:34,542
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard

1338
01:25:34,544 --> 01:25:36,311
in 18 months.

1339
01:25:36,313 --> 01:25:39,648
Nope. We are going
through the big one.

1340
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:40,882
The Devil's Anus?

1341
01:25:40,884 --> 01:25:42,318
Anus?

1342
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,452
Wait, wait, wait.
Whose anus?

1343
01:25:43,454 --> 01:25:44,319
For the record,
I didn't know

1344
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:45,253
it was called that
when I picked it.

1345
01:25:45,255 --> 01:25:47,488
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star...

1346
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:49,992
inside of an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1347
01:25:49,994 --> 01:25:51,460
We need another ship.

1348
01:25:51,462 --> 01:25:52,961
That would tear
mine to pieces.

1349
01:25:52,963 --> 01:25:54,662
She's right. We need
one that can withstand

1350
01:25:54,664 --> 01:25:55,963
the geodetic strain
from the singularity.

1351
01:25:55,965 --> 01:25:57,899
And has an offline
power steering system...

1352
01:25:57,901 --> 01:26:00,836
that could also function
without the on-board computer.

1353
01:26:00,838 --> 01:26:02,337
And we need one
with cup holders,

1354
01:26:02,339 --> 01:26:04,038
because we're gonna die.
So, drinks!

1355
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,108
Do I know you?
I feel like I know you.

1356
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:08,344
I feel like I know you, too.
It's weird.

1357
01:26:08,346 --> 01:26:09,578
What do you say?

1358
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:10,712
Uncharted metagalactic travel

1359
01:26:10,714 --> 01:26:12,081
through a volatile
cosmic gateway.

1360
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:13,916
Talk about an adventure.

1361
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:15,783
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.

1362
01:26:15,785 --> 01:26:16,851
There are one or two ships.

1363
01:26:16,853 --> 01:26:17,985
Absolute top of the line
models...

1364
01:26:17,987 --> 01:26:19,621
I don't mean to impose...

1365
01:26:22,759 --> 01:26:24,993
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.

1366
01:26:24,995 --> 01:26:26,729
I may even have stolen

1367
01:26:26,731 --> 01:26:28,764
the access codes
to his security system.

1368
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:29,832
And suddenly
you're overcome

1369
01:26:29,834 --> 01:26:31,100
with an urge
to do the right thing.

1370
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:32,167
Heavens, no.

1371
01:26:32,169 --> 01:26:33,969
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster...

1372
01:26:33,971 --> 01:26:36,070
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship...

1373
01:26:36,072 --> 01:26:39,608
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.

1374
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:40,943
You're telling us
that you can get us

1375
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:42,411
access into the garage...

1376
01:26:42,413 --> 01:26:44,145
without setting off
any alarms?

1377
01:26:44,147 --> 01:26:46,014
Yes, brother. I can.

1378
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:48,951
Okay, can I just...
A quick FYI.

1379
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:50,819
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago...

1380
01:26:50,821 --> 01:26:53,555
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

1381
01:26:53,557 --> 01:26:54,823
He did try to kill me.

1382
01:26:54,825 --> 01:26:56,824
Yes, me too.
On many, many occasions.

1383
01:26:56,826 --> 01:26:58,627
There was one time
when we were children...

1384
01:26:58,629 --> 01:27:00,061
he transformed himself
into a snake,

1385
01:27:00,063 --> 01:27:01,563
and he knows
that I love snakes.

1386
01:27:01,565 --> 01:27:03,564
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

1387
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:04,966
and he transformed back
into himself

1388
01:27:04,968 --> 01:27:06,467
and he was like,
"Yeah, it's me!"

1389
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:09,872
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

1390
01:27:09,874 --> 01:27:11,140
If we're
boosting a ship...

1391
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:12,875
we're gonna need to draw some
guards away from the palace.

1392
01:27:12,877 --> 01:27:14,475
Why not set
the beast loose?

1393
01:27:14,477 --> 01:27:15,644
Shut up.

1394
01:27:15,646 --> 01:27:16,744
You guys have a beast?

1395
01:27:16,746 --> 01:27:19,515
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1396
01:27:19,517 --> 01:27:21,516
We're going to start
a revolution.

1397
01:27:21,518 --> 01:27:23,118
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.

1398
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,421
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.

1399
01:27:26,423 --> 01:27:28,623
Is that some
sort of protoplasm,

1400
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:29,925
all the stuff
that's coming out of you...

1401
01:27:29,927 --> 01:27:31,362
or are they eggs?

1402
01:27:32,596 --> 01:27:33,798
Looks like eggs.

1403
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:37,067
Oh!

1404
01:27:43,106 --> 01:27:44,773
I'm looking for Korg.

1405
01:27:44,775 --> 01:27:46,140
Who's asking?

1406
01:27:46,142 --> 01:27:47,609
I know you're asking.

1407
01:27:47,611 --> 01:27:49,744
Is anyone else asking,
or is it just you?

1408
01:27:49,746 --> 01:27:51,915
The Lord of Thunder
sends his best.

1409
01:27:55,518 --> 01:27:57,786
The revolution has begun.

1410
01:27:57,788 --> 01:27:59,954
Revolution?
How did this happen?

1411
01:27:59,956 --> 01:28:01,689
Don't know.

1412
01:28:01,691 --> 01:28:03,091
But the arena's mainframe

1413
01:28:03,093 --> 01:28:04,960
for the Obedience Disks
have been deactivated...

1414
01:28:04,962 --> 01:28:06,929
and the slaves
have armed themselves.

1415
01:28:06,931 --> 01:28:09,198
Oh. I don't like that word.

1416
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,765
Which? Mainframe?

1417
01:28:10,767 --> 01:28:12,967
No. Why would I not like
"mainframe"?

1418
01:28:12,969 --> 01:28:15,136
No, the "S" word.

1419
01:28:15,138 --> 01:28:17,941
Sorry, the prisoners with
jobs have armed themselves.

1420
01:28:19,477 --> 01:28:20,745
Okay, that's better.

1421
01:28:26,816 --> 01:28:28,685
Hey, so, listen.
We should talk.

1422
01:28:30,087 --> 01:28:31,619
I disagree.

1423
01:28:31,621 --> 01:28:34,689
Open communication
was never our family's forte.

1424
01:28:34,691 --> 01:28:35,725
You have no idea.

1425
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:38,694
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

1426
01:28:38,696 --> 01:28:39,697
Hello.

1427
01:28:40,664 --> 01:28:41,699
Hi.

1428
01:28:48,905 --> 01:28:51,239
Odin brought us together.

1429
01:28:51,241 --> 01:28:54,111
It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.

1430
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:02,583
We might as well be
strangers now.

1431
01:29:02,585 --> 01:29:05,820
Two sons of the crown,
set adrift.

1432
01:29:05,822 --> 01:29:08,724
Oh.

1433
01:29:08,726 --> 01:29:10,246
Thought you didn't
wanna talk about it.

1434
01:29:11,829 --> 01:29:12,927
Here's the thing.

1435
01:29:12,929 --> 01:29:14,930
I'm probably better off
staying here on Sakaar.

1436
01:29:14,932 --> 01:29:16,701
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

1437
01:29:18,602 --> 01:29:20,068
Did you just agree with me?

1438
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:21,869
Come on, this place
is perfect for you.

1439
01:29:21,871 --> 01:29:23,738
It's savage,
chaotic, lawless...

1440
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:25,606
Brother, you're gonna do
great here.

1441
01:29:25,608 --> 01:29:27,178
Do you truly think
so little of me?

1442
01:29:29,245 --> 01:29:32,113
Loki, I thought
the world of you.

1443
01:29:32,115 --> 01:29:34,917
I thought we were gonna
fight side by side forever.

1444
01:29:34,919 --> 01:29:38,554
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

1445
01:29:38,556 --> 01:29:41,055
I don't know, maybe
there's still good in you.

1446
01:29:41,057 --> 01:29:42,256
But let's be honest,

1447
01:29:42,258 --> 01:29:44,661
our paths diverged
a long time ago.

1448
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:50,235
Yeah.

1449
01:29:51,569 --> 01:29:52,701
It's probably for the best

1450
01:29:52,703 --> 01:29:54,002
that we never
see each other again.

1451
01:29:54,004 --> 01:29:55,636
That's what you
always wanted.

1452
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:01,310
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1453
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:02,578
- What?
- "Get Help."

1454
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:03,645
No.

1455
01:30:03,647 --> 01:30:04,712
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.

1456
01:30:04,714 --> 01:30:05,980
It's great.
It works every time.

1457
01:30:05,982 --> 01:30:07,349
- It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan?

1458
01:30:07,351 --> 01:30:09,083
- No.
- We're doing it.

1459
01:30:09,085 --> 01:30:11,319
We are not doing
"Get Help."

1460
01:30:11,321 --> 01:30:13,287
Get help! Please!

1461
01:30:13,289 --> 01:30:14,655
My brother, he's dying.

1462
01:30:14,657 --> 01:30:16,660
Get help! Help him!

1463
01:30:18,696 --> 01:30:19,961
Classic.

1464
01:30:19,963 --> 01:30:21,596
Still hate it.

1465
01:30:21,598 --> 01:30:23,998
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.

1466
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,201
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?

1467
01:30:26,203 --> 01:30:27,205
<i>The Commodore.</i>

1468
01:30:27,804 --> 01:30:28,806
Right.

1469
01:30:31,842 --> 01:30:34,312
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.

1470
01:30:36,614 --> 01:30:39,381
Oh, Loki.

1471
01:30:39,383 --> 01:30:40,983
I know I've betrayed you
many times before...

1472
01:30:40,985 --> 01:30:42,850
but this time it's truly
nothing personal.

1473
01:30:42,852 --> 01:30:44,786
The reward for your capture

1474
01:30:44,788 --> 01:30:46,054
will set me up nicely.

1475
01:30:46,056 --> 01:30:47,889
Never one for sentiment,
were you?

1476
01:30:47,891 --> 01:30:49,725
Easier to let it burn.

1477
01:30:49,727 --> 01:30:50,728
I agree.

1478
01:30:59,102 --> 01:31:01,369
Oh, that looks painful.

1479
01:31:01,371 --> 01:31:04,372
Oh, dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.

1480
01:31:04,374 --> 01:31:06,707
I trust you, you betray me.

1481
01:31:06,709 --> 01:31:08,877
Round and round
in circles we go.

1482
01:31:08,879 --> 01:31:11,012
See, Loki, life is about,
it's about growth.

1483
01:31:11,014 --> 01:31:12,314
It's about change.

1484
01:31:12,316 --> 01:31:16,118
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.

1485
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,953
I guess what I'm
trying to say...

1486
01:31:17,955 --> 01:31:21,055
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief...

1487
01:31:21,057 --> 01:31:22,659
but you could be more.

1488
01:31:25,029 --> 01:31:27,162
I'll just put this
over here for you.

1489
01:31:27,164 --> 01:31:30,768
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.

1490
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,073
All right,
I can figure this out.

1491
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:40,108
It's just another spaceship.

1492
01:31:53,222 --> 01:31:54,855
<i>Loyal Sakaarians...</i>

1493
01:31:54,857 --> 01:31:56,891
<i>Lord of Thunder
has stolen my ship</i>

1494
01:31:56,893 --> 01:31:58,295
<i>and my favorite champion.</i>

1495
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:03,097
<i>Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.</i>

1496
01:32:03,099 --> 01:32:04,936
<i>Do not let him
leave this planet.</i>

1497
01:32:17,914 --> 01:32:19,282
- Good shot!
- Thanks.

1498
01:32:22,052 --> 01:32:23,350
<i>Open the doors.</i>

1499
01:32:23,352 --> 01:32:24,888
Okay.

1500
01:32:29,993 --> 01:32:32,027
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.

1501
01:32:32,029 --> 01:32:33,063
Why?

1502
01:32:45,441 --> 01:32:47,375
Shouldn't we be
shooting back or something?

1503
01:32:47,377 --> 01:32:48,743
Yes, we should.

1504
01:32:48,745 --> 01:32:50,778
Where are the guns
on this ship?

1505
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:52,213
<i>There aren't any.</i>

1506
01:32:52,215 --> 01:32:54,015
- It's a leisure vessel.
<i>- What?</i>

1507
01:32:54,017 --> 01:32:55,516
Grandmaster uses it
for his good times,

1508
01:32:55,518 --> 01:32:57,018
orgies and stuff.

1509
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:58,386
Did she just say
the Grandmaster

1510
01:32:58,388 --> 01:32:59,820
uses it for orgies?

1511
01:32:59,822 --> 01:33:01,122
Yeah.

1512
01:33:01,124 --> 01:33:02,459
Don't touch anything.

1513
01:33:22,913 --> 01:33:23,915
No!

1514
01:33:27,151 --> 01:33:28,186
- No!
- No!

1515
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:36,358
Get inside!

1516
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,096
In a minute.

1517
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:51,405
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

1518
01:33:51,407 --> 01:33:53,140
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.

1519
01:33:53,142 --> 01:33:55,042
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.

1520
01:33:55,044 --> 01:33:58,281
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!

1521
01:34:32,615 --> 01:34:33,515
Okay, come on.

1522
01:34:33,517 --> 01:34:36,150
There's gotta be a gun
on this thing.

1523
01:34:36,152 --> 01:34:38,286
That looks like a gun.

1524
01:34:38,288 --> 01:34:39,887
<i>♪ It's my birthday</i>

1525
01:34:39,889 --> 01:34:41,590
<i>♪ It's my birthday</i>

1526
01:34:41,592 --> 01:34:42,890
<i>♪ It's my birthday ♪</i>

1527
01:34:50,868 --> 01:34:52,102
Yeah!

1528
01:35:09,352 --> 01:35:11,556
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!

1529
01:35:18,361 --> 01:35:19,493
There she is.

1530
01:35:19,495 --> 01:35:22,096
Our ticket out of here.

1531
01:35:22,098 --> 01:35:23,333
Hey, what's this?

1532
01:35:28,237 --> 01:35:29,503
Thank you.

1533
01:35:29,505 --> 01:35:32,106
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

1534
01:35:32,108 --> 01:35:33,507
You wanna come?

1535
01:35:33,509 --> 01:35:36,278
You do seem like

1536
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:38,113
you're in desperate need
of leadership.

1537
01:35:38,115 --> 01:35:39,550
Why, thank you.

1538
01:35:43,352 --> 01:35:44,422
Here we go.

1539
01:35:51,093 --> 01:35:52,159
Shit.

1540
01:36:09,446 --> 01:36:11,412
Asgardians...

1541
01:36:11,414 --> 01:36:14,716
some misguided soul...

1542
01:36:14,718 --> 01:36:17,018
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1543
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:19,453
Tell us where it is...

1544
01:36:19,455 --> 01:36:22,159
or there will be consequences.

1545
01:36:26,096 --> 01:36:27,197
Bad ones.

1546
01:36:30,334 --> 01:36:31,335
Well?

1547
01:36:38,407 --> 01:36:39,606
You.

1548
01:37:15,611 --> 01:37:19,983
Well? Executioner?

1549
01:37:24,754 --> 01:37:26,153
Wait!

1550
01:37:26,155 --> 01:37:27,157
Wait!

1551
01:37:29,659 --> 01:37:30,962
I know where the sword is.

1552
01:38:13,703 --> 01:38:16,107
I never thought
I'd be back here.

1553
01:38:19,575 --> 01:38:21,609
I thought
it'd be a lot nicer.

1554
01:38:21,611 --> 01:38:23,243
I mean, not that
it's not nice.

1555
01:38:23,245 --> 01:38:24,746
It's just,
it's on fire.

1556
01:38:24,748 --> 01:38:26,314
Here, up here
in the mountains.

1557
01:38:26,316 --> 01:38:28,616
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.

1558
01:38:28,618 --> 01:38:29,751
She's coming for them.

1559
01:38:29,753 --> 01:38:31,219
Okay, drop me off
at the palace

1560
01:38:31,221 --> 01:38:33,287
- and I'll draw her away.
- And get yourself killed?

1561
01:38:33,289 --> 01:38:35,222
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.

1562
01:38:35,224 --> 01:38:36,558
While I'm dealing with Hela,
I need you two

1563
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,859
to help get
everyone off Asgard.

1564
01:38:37,861 --> 01:38:40,295
How the hell are we supposed
to do that?

1565
01:38:40,297 --> 01:38:42,066
I have a man on the ground.

1566
01:38:47,771 --> 01:38:48,773
Asgard.

1567
01:38:52,308 --> 01:38:53,576
She's here.

1568
01:39:05,222 --> 01:39:07,122
Now the ship has a gun.

1569
01:39:07,124 --> 01:39:08,259
I'll take it from here.

1570
01:39:09,125 --> 01:39:12,228
I found this in the armory.

1571
01:39:15,365 --> 01:39:16,534
Good luck.

1572
01:39:17,901 --> 01:39:19,437
Your Majesty...

1573
01:39:21,404 --> 01:39:22,505
don't die.

1574
01:39:25,342 --> 01:39:27,178
You know what I mean.

1575
01:40:25,901 --> 01:40:27,837
We must
keep moving!

1576
01:40:28,538 --> 01:40:30,374
Go to the Bifrost!

1577
01:41:12,848 --> 01:41:14,351
Sister.

1578
01:41:16,352 --> 01:41:18,319
You're still alive.

1579
01:41:18,321 --> 01:41:20,287
I love what you've done
with the place.

1580
01:41:20,289 --> 01:41:21,823
Redecorating, I see.

1581
01:41:21,825 --> 01:41:23,957
It seems
our father's solution

1582
01:41:23,959 --> 01:41:26,696
to every problem
was to cover it up.

1583
01:41:27,998 --> 01:41:29,833
Or to cast it out.

1584
01:41:31,901 --> 01:41:35,970
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.

1585
01:41:35,972 --> 01:41:37,474
You see?

1586
01:41:38,008 --> 01:41:40,541
You never knew him.

1587
01:41:40,543 --> 01:41:42,609
Not at his best.

1588
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:45,579
Odin and I drowned
entire civilizations

1589
01:41:45,581 --> 01:41:47,381
in blood and tears.

1590
01:41:47,383 --> 01:41:50,451
Where do you think
all this gold came from?

1591
01:41:50,453 --> 01:41:52,386
And then, one day...

1592
01:41:52,388 --> 01:41:55,523
he decided to become
a benevolent king.

1593
01:41:55,525 --> 01:41:58,228
To foster peace,
to protect life...

1594
01:41:59,329 --> 01:42:01,362
to have you.

1595
01:42:01,364 --> 01:42:03,797
I understand
why you're angry.

1596
01:42:03,799 --> 01:42:05,433
And you are my sister,
and technically

1597
01:42:05,435 --> 01:42:07,868
have a claim to the throne.

1598
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:09,871
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.

1599
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:11,372
But it can't be you.

1600
01:42:11,374 --> 01:42:14,911
You're just...
The worst.

1601
01:42:16,478 --> 01:42:18,445
Okay, get up.

1602
01:42:18,447 --> 01:42:20,483
You're in my seat.

1603
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:23,583
You know,
Father once told me...

1604
01:42:23,585 --> 01:42:26,354
that a wise king
never seeks out war.

1605
01:42:26,356 --> 01:42:28,791
But must always
be ready for it.

1606
01:43:00,856 --> 01:43:02,489
Go back!

1607
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:08,799
Go!

1608
01:43:43,732 --> 01:43:46,402
To be honest,
I expected more.

1609
01:43:49,405 --> 01:43:50,640
Heimdall!

1610
01:43:52,808 --> 01:43:54,610
The sword!

1611
01:43:59,014 --> 01:44:00,782
Here's the difference
between us.

1612
01:44:00,784 --> 01:44:02,582
I'm Odin's firstborn...

1613
01:44:02,584 --> 01:44:05,051
the rightful heir,
the savior of Asgard.

1614
01:44:05,053 --> 01:44:06,856
And you're nothing.

1615
01:44:17,066 --> 01:44:20,033
So simple, even a blind man
could see it.

1616
01:44:21,971 --> 01:44:23,738
Oh.

1617
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:26,006
Now you remind me of Dad.

1618
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:37,987
The stupid dog won't die!

1619
01:44:59,843 --> 01:45:03,010
Everything's gonna be all right now.
I got this.

1620
01:45:03,012 --> 01:45:06,046
You wanted to know
who I am?

1621
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,881
What the hell
are you talking about?

1622
01:45:07,883 --> 01:45:09,419
You'll see!

1623
01:45:57,967 --> 01:46:00,268
You see?
No one's going anywhere.

1624
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:01,903
I'll get that sword...

1625
01:46:01,905 --> 01:46:04,675
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

1626
01:46:31,034 --> 01:46:32,069
Hey, man.

1627
01:46:33,835 --> 01:46:35,302
I'm Korg.
This is Miek.

1628
01:46:35,304 --> 01:46:36,671
We're gonna jump
on that spaceship

1629
01:46:36,673 --> 01:46:37,939
and get out of here.
Wanna come?

1630
01:46:47,650 --> 01:46:51,522
Your savior is here.

1631
01:46:58,695 --> 01:47:00,728
Did you miss me?

1632
01:47:00,730 --> 01:47:02,098
Everyone, on that ship now.

1633
01:47:06,602 --> 01:47:08,868
Welcome home.
I saw you coming.

1634
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:09,940
Of course you did.

1635
01:47:26,688 --> 01:47:28,925
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.

1636
01:47:29,959 --> 01:47:31,826
You see...

1637
01:47:31,828 --> 01:47:34,764
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1638
01:47:36,331 --> 01:47:39,233
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1639
01:47:39,235 --> 01:47:41,737
What were you
the god of, again?

1640
01:47:53,081 --> 01:47:55,750
Even when
you had two eyes...

1641
01:47:55,752 --> 01:47:57,654
you'd see
only half the picture.

1642
01:47:59,121 --> 01:48:02,124
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.

1643
01:48:03,191 --> 01:48:06,894
Are you Thor,
the God of Hammers? Hmm?

1644
01:48:09,865 --> 01:48:12,198
That hammer was to help you
control your power,

1645
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,268
to focus it.

1646
01:48:14,270 --> 01:48:16,871
It was never your source
of strength.

1647
01:48:16,873 --> 01:48:19,142
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.

1648
01:48:20,175 --> 01:48:22,913
Asgard is not a place.
Never was.

1649
01:48:24,112 --> 01:48:25,348
This could be Asgard.

1650
01:48:26,682 --> 01:48:29,750
Asgard is where
our people stand.

1651
01:48:29,752 --> 01:48:34,391
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.

1652
01:48:42,164 --> 01:48:44,266
I'm not as strong as you.

1653
01:48:47,003 --> 01:48:48,038
No...

1654
01:48:49,371 --> 01:48:50,807
you're stronger.

1655
01:48:59,816 --> 01:49:01,247
Tell me, brother.

1656
01:49:01,249 --> 01:49:03,884
What were you
the god of again?

1657
01:51:19,321 --> 01:51:21,622
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.

1658
01:51:21,624 --> 01:51:23,226
This isn't over.

1659
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:32,102
I think we should
disband the Revengers.

1660
01:51:33,569 --> 01:51:35,002
Hit her with
a lightning blast.

1661
01:51:35,004 --> 01:51:36,136
I just hit her with
the biggest lightning blast

1662
01:51:36,138 --> 01:51:37,371
in the history of lightning.

1663
01:51:37,373 --> 01:51:38,375
It did nothing.

1664
01:51:42,378 --> 01:51:45,211
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

1665
01:51:45,213 --> 01:51:47,280
It won't end there.

1666
01:51:47,282 --> 01:51:50,951
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.

1667
01:51:50,953 --> 01:51:52,653
She'll hunt us down.

1668
01:51:52,655 --> 01:51:54,421
We need to stop her
here and now.

1669
01:51:54,423 --> 01:51:56,390
So what do we do?

1670
01:51:56,392 --> 01:51:58,061
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1671
01:52:10,172 --> 01:52:13,410
Asgard's not a place,
it's a people.

1672
01:52:15,477 --> 01:52:16,609
Loki...

1673
01:52:16,611 --> 01:52:18,912
this was never about
stopping Ragnarok.

1674
01:52:18,914 --> 01:52:21,081
This was about
causing Ragnarok.

1675
01:52:21,083 --> 01:52:22,585
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1676
01:52:24,253 --> 01:52:26,220
It's the only way.

1677
01:52:26,222 --> 01:52:27,590
Bold move, brother.

1678
01:52:29,025 --> 01:52:30,493
Even for me.

1679
01:52:33,663 --> 01:52:34,897
Shall we?

1680
01:52:35,998 --> 01:52:37,000
After you.

1681
01:53:02,424 --> 01:53:04,123
This is madness.

1682
01:53:17,505 --> 01:53:19,174
Go! Go, now!

1683
01:54:20,201 --> 01:54:21,570
For Asgard.

1684
01:54:35,785 --> 01:54:37,253
Hela!

1685
01:55:01,709 --> 01:55:06,015
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn.

1686
01:55:17,593 --> 01:55:18,795
Hela, enough!

1687
01:55:22,397 --> 01:55:25,431
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1688
01:55:25,433 --> 01:55:29,103
Whatever game you're
playing, it won't work.

1689
01:55:29,105 --> 01:55:30,639
You can't defeat me.

1690
01:55:31,339 --> 01:55:32,608
No, I know.

1691
01:55:34,375 --> 01:55:35,411
But he can.

1692
01:55:39,647 --> 01:55:41,150
No.

1693
01:55:49,624 --> 01:55:53,292
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1694
01:55:53,294 --> 01:55:55,397
I am your reckoning!

1695
01:56:04,173 --> 01:56:06,305
The people are safe.

1696
01:56:06,307 --> 01:56:08,210
That's all that matters.

1697
01:56:09,879 --> 01:56:11,744
We're fulfilling
the prophecy.

1698
01:56:11,746 --> 01:56:13,380
I hate this prophecy.

1699
01:56:13,382 --> 01:56:15,349
So do I,
but we have no choice.

1700
01:56:15,351 --> 01:56:17,317
Surtur destroys Asgard...

1701
01:56:17,319 --> 01:56:19,720
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.

1702
01:56:19,722 --> 01:56:21,454
But we need to let him
finish the job,

1703
01:56:21,456 --> 01:56:22,656
otherwise...

1704
01:56:24,259 --> 01:56:25,324
No!

1705
01:56:27,596 --> 01:56:29,695
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1706
01:56:38,706 --> 01:56:39,872
Hulk, stop.

1707
01:56:39,874 --> 01:56:43,112
Just for once in your life,
don't smash.

1708
01:56:44,245 --> 01:56:45,945
Big monster!

1709
01:56:45,947 --> 01:56:47,517
Let's go!

1710
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:50,253
Fine.

1711
01:57:14,410 --> 01:57:17,313
I am Asgard's doom!

1712
01:57:40,302 --> 01:57:42,502
The damage
is not too bad.

1713
01:57:42,504 --> 01:57:44,637
As long as the foundations
are still strong...

1714
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:46,472
we can rebuild this place.

1715
01:57:46,474 --> 01:57:48,774
It will become a haven...

1716
01:57:48,776 --> 01:57:51,747
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.

1717
01:57:58,353 --> 01:58:01,854
Now those foundations
are gone. Sorry.

1718
01:58:16,038 --> 01:58:17,973
What have I done?

1719
01:58:19,307 --> 01:58:21,774
You saved us from extinction.

1720
01:58:21,776 --> 01:58:23,645
Asgard is not a place...

1721
01:58:25,047 --> 01:58:26,950
it's a people.

1722
01:58:55,843 --> 01:58:57,446
It suits you.

1723
01:59:00,048 --> 01:59:02,851
Maybe you're not so bad
after all, brother.

1724
01:59:03,419 --> 01:59:04,454
Maybe not.

1725
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:07,554
Thank you.

1726
01:59:07,556 --> 01:59:09,959
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.

1727
01:59:14,029 --> 01:59:15,431
I'm here.

1728
01:59:39,655 --> 01:59:41,691
Your throne.

1729
01:59:56,004 --> 01:59:59,474
So. King of Asgard.

1730
02:00:09,884 --> 02:00:10,986
Where to?

1731
02:00:12,087 --> 02:00:13,920
I'm not sure.

1732
02:00:13,922 --> 02:00:15,525
Any suggestions?

1733
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:19,960
Miek, where are you from?

1734
02:00:19,962 --> 02:00:21,961
Oh, Miek's dead.

1735
02:00:21,963 --> 02:00:25,399
Yeah, no, I accidentally
stomped on him on the bridge.

1736
02:00:25,401 --> 02:00:26,867
I've just felt so guilty,

1737
02:00:26,869 --> 02:00:28,349
I've been carrying him
around all day.

1738
02:00:30,071 --> 02:00:32,072
Miek, you're alive!

1739
02:00:32,074 --> 02:00:33,472
He's alive, guys.

1740
02:00:33,474 --> 02:00:34,794
What was
your question again, bro?

1741
02:00:36,078 --> 02:00:37,911
Earth it is.

1742
02:02:54,282 --> 02:02:55,948
Do you really think
it's a good idea

1743
02:02:55,950 --> 02:02:57,183
to go back to Earth?

1744
02:02:57,185 --> 02:02:58,184
Yes, of course.

1745
02:02:58,186 --> 02:03:01,086
The people of Earth love me.
I'm very popular.

1746
02:03:01,088 --> 02:03:03,155
Let me rephrase that.

1747
02:03:03,157 --> 02:03:05,058
Do you really think
it's a good idea

1748
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:06,960
to bring me back to Earth?

1749
02:03:06,962 --> 02:03:09,128
Probably not,
to be honest.

1750
02:03:09,130 --> 02:03:10,963
I wouldn't worry, brother.

1751
02:03:10,965 --> 02:03:14,070
I feel like everything's
gonna work out fine.

1752
02:09:42,990 --> 02:09:43,993
Oh, boy.

1753
02:09:50,597 --> 02:09:52,532
Oh.

1754
02:09:52,534 --> 02:09:56,970
I just gotta say,
I'm proud of you all.

1755
02:09:56,972 --> 02:10:00,439
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!

1756
02:10:00,441 --> 02:10:03,141
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.

1757
02:10:03,143 --> 02:10:05,645
Come on. No?

1758
02:10:05,647 --> 02:10:08,014
Me too. 'Cause I've been
a big part of it.

1759
02:10:08,016 --> 02:10:10,984
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.

1760
02:10:10,986 --> 02:10:13,152
So, you're welcome.

1761
02:10:13,154 --> 02:10:15,424
And, uh, it's a tie.
