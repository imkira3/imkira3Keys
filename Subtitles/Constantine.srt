3
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,650
I think...

4
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,020
I think I found you one.

5
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,590
Look, I called you, right?

6
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,000
Soon as I couldn't pull it out myself,
I called you, John.

7
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,990
It's okay, it's okay.
We had to tie her down, okay?

8
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,060
It's okay.

9
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,950
This is Constantine.

10
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,220
John Constantine, asshole.

11
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,760
Sure.

12
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,920
What the hell?

13
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,030
I need a mirror.

14
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,210
Now. At least 3 feet high.

15
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,040
Move! Go, now!

16
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,930
This is Kramer.

17
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,500
Chas Kramer, asshole.

18
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,360
Asshole.

19
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,740
What? Oh, this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, asshole.

20
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,040
- Chas!
- What?

21
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,940
- Move the car.
- Why?

22
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,910
Move the damn car!

23
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,350
"Chas, move the car."

24
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,890
There, car's moved.

25
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,030
Lift it up over the bed.

26
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,110
Tie that end off.
Hennessy, over the top.

27
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,780
Close your eyes.
And whatever happens, don't look.

28
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,990
No!

29
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,240
Show yourself.

30
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,340
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

31
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,050
For your boss.

32
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,330
Pull it!

33
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,720
Ma? Ma?

34
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,090
Like I said, I found you something,
didn't I, John? Didn't I?

35
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,920
What happened in there?

36
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,600
Going to a lot of meetings, I see.

37
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,900
Keeps the voices out so I can sleep.

38
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,540
I have to sleep, John.

39
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,740
I need some help, Father.

40
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,040
You do?

41
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,940
From me?

42
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,820
What kind of...?

43
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,250
- Hey, listen, I...
- That exorcism wasn't right.

44
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,090
Listen to the ether.

45
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,690
Anything unusual, you let me know.

46
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,240
Come on, you don't need its protection.
It'll be like back in the day.

47
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,500
A few days.

48
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,110
Okay.

49
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,690
Okay. For you, John.

50
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,650
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

51
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,490
- I told you to move it.
- You did tell me to move it,

52
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,100
but if you'd said you were dropping
a 300-pound mirror with a demon,

53
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,100
I would've moved it further, John.

54
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,930
- Take Alvarado.
- Yeah, thank you. I know what to take.

55
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,970
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe I could help out?

56
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,700
- No?
- Nope.

57
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,940
Nope?

58
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,210
Of course it's a nope.

59
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,880
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

60
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,150
<i>It's been...</i>

61
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,350
<i>two weeks since my last confession.</i>

62
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,900
I killed a man today.

63
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,700
Another one.

64
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,110
I didn't even see his face, I just...

65
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,550
pulled the trigger, and he went away.

66
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:18,920
<i>Most cops go 20 years
without firing their guns.</i>

67
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,190
<i>Why do I always know
where these guys are?</i>

68
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,700
<i>Where to aim, when to fire.</i>

69
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,270
<i>I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, Father?</i>

70
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,100
<i>Something damned?</i>

71
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,610
<i>God has a plan for you.
He has a plan for us all.</i>

72
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,210
<i>You mustn't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.</i>

73
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,410
<i>Yeah, I'm trying.</i>

74
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,660
<i>I'm trying real hard.</i>

75
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,580
<i>Isabel.</i>

76
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,810
<i>Isabel.</i>

77
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,740
Things I've beaten.

78
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,600
Things most people never even heard of.

79
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,210
And now I'm gonna be done in by this.

80
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,680
Wouldn't be the first, John.

81
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,580
Come on, Les.

82
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,090
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

83
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,160
This is aggressive.

84
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,400
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

85
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,560
Now you don't wanna leave.

86
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,400
Yeah, that's a good idea.

87
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,360
John, you really need to prepare.

88
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,910
- Make arrangements.
- No need.

89
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,240
I already know exactly where I'm going.

90
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,220
- Morning.
- Good morning.

91
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,360
- Good morning.
- Detective.

92
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,360
- No, no, no.
- Angela, wait.

93
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,190
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

94
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,860
Give us the room, please.

95
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,130
Isabel.

96
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,140
She fell from the roof?

97
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,140
She jumped.

98
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,910
- No.
- Look...

99
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,210
I know it's hard to accept.
She was sick.

100
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,290
- Isabel wouldn't kill herself.
- Angie.

101
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,230
- She wouldn't kill herself.
- Detective.

102
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,500
- Period.
- Detective.

103
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,300
Period!

104
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,030
Angie, there were security cameras.

105
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,850
- Hold the door. You going down?
- Not if I can help it.

106
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,170
A new case?

107
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,080
The big score? The mother lode?
The one you've been waiting for?

108
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,290
- Humor me.
- Don't I always?

109
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,880
Oh, yeah, that's...
Much obliged. Thank you.

110
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,590
How you feeling, John?

111
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,420
So, what's new?

112
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,470
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope,

113
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,270
holy-water ampoules
from the River Jordan,

114
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,380
and, you'll love this,
screech beetle from Amityville.

115
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,620
Yeah, it's funny to you, but to the
fallen, that's like nails on a chalkboard.

116
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,920
What is it, exactly, with you and bugs?

117
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,990
I just like them.

118
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,060
Yeah. Who doesn't?

119
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,260
Yeah, easy there, hero.

120
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,000
- That's dragon's breath.
- I thought you couldn't get it anymore.

121
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,970
Yeah, well, I know a guy
who knows a guy.

122
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,750
So, what's the action?

123
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,990
I just pulled a soldier demon
out of a little girl.

124
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,260
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

125
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,730
- Yeah, I know how it sounds.
- No, we're finger puppets to them, John,

126
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,300
not doorways.

127
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,600
They can work us, but they can't
come through onto our plane.

128
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,330
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there's any precedent.

129
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,410
Sure thing, John.

130
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,170
Anything else?

131
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,440
Wouldn't happen to have
anything for a...?

132
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,380
On the house.

133
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,950
All right, question. How much longer
do I have to be your slave, John?

134
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,020
You're not my slave, Chas.

135
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,890
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

136
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,230
Like Tonto or Robin.

137
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,100
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

138
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,170
Right. So then why don't I apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

139
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,740
John? John.

140
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,680
I love our little talks, John.

141
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,070
- May I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?
- No, thanks, I'm not gonna be staying long.

142
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,830
- How about you, ma'am?
- Oh, no, I'm not staying long either.

143
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,470
I really need to speak with him.
It's important.

144
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,370
First come, first served.

145
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,610
So you're rude no matter where you are.

146
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,230
- Father.
- Hi.

147
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,530
- You have news. Yes.
- Yes, I spoke with the bishop.

148
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,200
I know what you want, son.

149
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,900
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

150
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,470
I'm flattered.

151
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,910
Well, I could offer something

152
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,320
about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of his flock,

153
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,590
but it might sound disingenuous.

154
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,490
She has to have a Catholic funeral,
Father. She has to.

155
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,890
- Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin.
- She didn't commit suicide.

156
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,660
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules.

157
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,930
Oh, rules.

158
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,940
Father.

159
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,670
David.

160
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,270
This is Isabel.

161
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,180
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

162
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,810
Please.

163
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,380
I'm sorry.

164
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,750
I've been seeing some unusual
soul traffic lately.

165
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,660
You might consider
giving me an extension.

166
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,430
I could do your side some good
these days.

167
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,830
You still trying to buy your way
into heaven?

168
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,760
What about the minions I've sent back?

169
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,070
- That alone should guarantee my entry.
- How many times have I told you?

170
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,270
That's not the way this works.

171
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,140
Why, haven't I served him enough?

172
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,050
- What does he want from me?
- Only the usual.

173
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,310
Self-sacrifice, belief.

174
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,690
- Oh, I believe, for chrissake.
- No, no, you know.

175
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,410
And there's a difference. You've seen.

176
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,960
I never asked to see.
I was born with this curse.

177
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,190
A gift, John.

178
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,860
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

179
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,570
I'm pulling demons out of little girls.

180
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,570
Who's that for?

181
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,310
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

182
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,710
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

183
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,510
Impossible rules, endless regulations,

184
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,780
who goes up, who goes down and why.

185
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,890
You don't even understand us.

186
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,190
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

187
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,920
Why me, Gabriel?

188
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,750
It's personal, isn't it?

189
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:59,620
I didn't go to church enough,
I didn't pray enough,

190
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,260
I was 5 bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

191
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,000
You are going to die young...

192
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,110
because you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 15.

193
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,130
And you're going to go to hell...

194
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,370
because of the life you took.

195
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,250
You're fucked.

196
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,300
At least it's nice out.

197
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,170
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

198
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,370
And his punch lines are killers.

199
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,050
John!

200
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,390
Constantine, it's raining! John! Hey!

201
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,610
<i>Twenty-two women were found buried
in the assailant's back yard.</i>

202
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,470
<i>So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match...</i>

203
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:33,020
<i>Police report she had been
physically penetrated</i>

204
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,950
<i>over 100 times and buried alive.</i>

205
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,890
<i>...found locked in a storage freezer,
his head severed and his organs...</i>

206
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,050
<i>He stuffed Holly's body into...</i>

207
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,690
<i>- The bodies ravished by the unknown...
- He used a small handsaw...</i>

208
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,530
<i>Had nearly decapitated...
Even his eyes were gouged out.</i>

209
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,590
<i>Isabel.</i>

210
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,860
I'm so sorry, lzzy.

211
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,830
<i>Constantine.</i>

212
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,790
Dodson.

213
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,260
Hello?

214
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,500
Hello.

215
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,860
Hello?

216
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,980
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

217
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,100
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

218
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,360
I know where you're going, John.
You're going to Midnite's.

219
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,170
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

220
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,110
It's a haven for those who rise and fall.
I remember reading about this, John.

221
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,040
- You read too much, kid. It's a bar.
- It's a bar?

222
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,580
It's a bar. Papa Midnite is a crusader for
good. He swore the oath of neutrality.

223
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,380
- John, the man's a legend.
- Yeah.

224
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,750
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?
I'm begging you, John, please?

225
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,090
- Sure, you can get in.
- I can get in?

226
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,460
If you can get in.

227
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,970
If I can get...? It's a bear, though, right?
Or two ducks in a cloud?

228
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,670
Two frogs on a bench.

229
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,980
Two frogs on a bench.

230
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,140
No, no, I'm with the guy you just...

231
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,180
John! John!

232
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,340
I'm with him, though.

233
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,460
Rat in a dress.

234
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,990
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

235
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,130
I'm just testing. I'm just testing.

236
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,250
Don't get up.

237
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,950
You've been absent some time.

238
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,130
Have you come here with relics to sell?

239
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,690
No, I'm out of that now.
I've been too busy.

240
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,720
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

241
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,870
Midnite, Jesus...

242
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,470
I thought the thing was authentic.

243
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,070
I see now.

244
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,580
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

245
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,540
A few months, maybe a year.

246
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,380
I thought I heard thunder last night.

247
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,680
Must have been
Satan's stomach growling.

248
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,990
You're the one soul he'd come
up here himself to collect.

249
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,460
So I've heard.

250
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:55,260
Well, I am most certain
you did not come here
for a sympathetic shoulder to cry on.

251
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,370
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

252
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,770
They don't like you, John.

253
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,840
How many have you
deported back to hell?

254
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:10,540
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.
A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

255
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,450
Clearly I do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

256
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,320
And yesterday I saw a soldier demon
trying to chew its way out
through a little girl.

257
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:23,550
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in heaven...

258
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,260
The great detente
of the original superpowers.

259
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:31,340
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

260
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,100
Now...

261
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,740
I need to use the chair.

262
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,510
John, forgetting the fact that it would
almost certainly kill you,

263
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,410
you know I am neutral.

264
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,820
And as long as the balance
is maintained, I take no sides.

265
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,620
Before you were a bartender...

266
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,150
you were one witch doctor
against, what, 30 Ashgar?

267
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,060
- And I...
- You were Constantine.

268
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,600
The John Constantine.

269
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,030
Once.

270
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,810
This isn't the usual game, I can feel it.

271
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,410
Something's coming.

272
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,340
Spooky.

273
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,180
Balthazar.

274
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,450
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

275
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,580
I'll make your night.

276
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,460
I'll deport your sorry ass right where
you stand, you half-breed shit!

277
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:37,970
You know the rules of my house.
While here, you will abide by them.

278
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,110
Johnny boy.

279
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:46,740
Word is you're on your way down.

280
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,140
Fresh meat.

281
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,750
Finger-licking good.

282
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,920
We have a meeting now, John.

283
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,230
What? I didn't catch that.

284
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,040
Welcome to my life.

285
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,920
Mr. Constantine.

286
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,460
- I saw you...
- I remember.

287
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,090
- And then I saw you at the...
- Regular kismet.

288
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,790
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

289
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,060
I'm not really in the talking mood
right now.

290
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,910
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

291
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,200
Please?

292
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,980
Always a catch.

293
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,560
My sister was murdered yesterday.

294
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,670
- Sorry to hear.
- Thanks.

295
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,940
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She jumped off the roof.

296
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,540
Thought you said she was murdered.

297
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,740
Yeah, well, Isabel wouldn't
have taken her own life.

298
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,550
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

299
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,650
That's just crazy.

300
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,520
Look, I've heard your name
around the precinct.

301
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,900
I know the circles you travel in.
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

302
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:26,700
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

303
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:31,610
She started talking about demons,
angels.

304
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,510
Now, I think someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine.

305
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,480
I think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

306
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,090
Some kind of legion or cult.

307
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,220
Sounds like a theory, detective.

308
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,830
Good luck.

309
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,530
I thought with your background,
you could at least
point me in the right direction.

310
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,030
Yeah, okay, sure.

311
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,370
It wasn't a suicide.

312
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,700
My sister was a devout Catholic.

313
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,370
Do you understand that?
If she took her own life...

314
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,350
Her soul would go straight to hell...

315
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,650
where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony,

316
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,050
for all eternity. That it?

317
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,250
That about right?

318
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,360
Goddamn you.

319
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,170
Detective.

320
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,200
What if I told you that God
and the devil made a wager,

321
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,860
a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

322
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,510
I'd tell you to stay on your meds.

323
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,980
Humor me. No direct contact with
humans. That would be the rule.

324
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,510
- Just influence. See who would win.
- Okay, I'm humoring you.

325
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,780
- Why?
- Who knows.

326
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,050
- Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.
- Oh, so it's fun.

327
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:31,190
It's fun when a man beats his wife to
death, when a mother drowns her baby.

328
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,130
And you think the devil is responsible?

329
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,070
People are evil, Mr. Constantine. People.

330
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,670
You're right. We're born
capable of terrible things.

331
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,610
Then sometimes something else comes
along and gives us just the right nudge.

332
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,270
Well, this has been real educational...

333
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,110
but I don't believe in the devil.

334
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,740
You should. He believes in you.

335
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,070
It's a power outage.

336
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,210
Not likely.

337
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:25,280
- What?
- We should go. Now.

338
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,380
What is that?

339
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,220
Wings.

340
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,160
Maybe talons.

341
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,190
You're kidding. Of what?

342
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,190
Something that's not
supposed to be here.

343
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,740
That's really not going to help.

344
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,110
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

345
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,510
Suit yourself.

346
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:26,140
Demons stay in hell, huh?

347
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,570
Tell them that.

348
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,590
Don't worry. Happens to everyone
the first time.

349
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,880
It's the sulfur.

350
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,450
Sulfur.

351
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,100
What were those things?

352
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,130
Demons.

353
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,330
- Scavengers of the damned.
- No, no. It's impossible.

354
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:59,310
Yeah. And I don't think
they were after me.

355
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:04,470
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

356
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,080
Isabel?

357
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,950
Never in a million years.

358
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,420
Well, let's be sure.

359
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,120
Let's see if she's in hell.

360
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,780
Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?

361
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,420
In front of the chair.

362
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,120
I can't believe I'm doing this.

363
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,920
- These are all Isabel's things?
- Yeah.

364
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,960
- How about the cat?
- Duck?

365
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,730
Yeah, why?

366
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,130
Duck.

367
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,640
Oh, you think that's strange.

368
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,240
Cats are good.

369
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,040
Half in, half out anyway.

370
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,560
If this is some kind of spell
or something,

371
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,900
don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

372
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,370
Why, do you have any?

373
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,670
- This is crazy.
- Yes.

374
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,540
I need you to leave.

375
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,210
- I'm sorry?
- Angela, please.

376
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,510
The apartment.

377
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,360
Okay.

378
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,230
Be careful with that cat.

379
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,070
God, I hate this part.

380
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,700
- Isabel.
- Constantine.

381
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,680
Angela.

382
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,640
Jesus.

383
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,620
- Constantine, what...?
- Twins.

384
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,730
Jesus. What?

385
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,120
- You were twins.
- What did you say?

386
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,960
- She killed herself.
- What?

387
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,730
And she's damned for it.

388
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,450
How is this possible?

389
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,820
I need to eat.

390
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:36,070
Hey! Hey, what are you doing in here?

391
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,000
Relax, man.

392
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,410
Slow down!

393
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:09,570
What the hell kind of place is this?

394
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,950
John.

395
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,250
When I was a kid, I could see things.

396
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,810
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

397
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:43,260
<i>Things you shouldn't have to see.</i>

398
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,180
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

399
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,850
<i>They made it worse.</i>

400
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,090
You think you're crazy long enough,

401
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:14,890
you find a way out.

402
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:19,160
<i>- You tried to kill yourself.
- I didn't try anything.</i>

403
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,030
<i>Officially, I was dead for two minutes.</i>

404
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,340
But when you cross over,

405
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,840
time stops.

406
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,110
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

407
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,350
When I came back...

408
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,050
I knew...

409
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:48,120
all the things I could see were real.

410
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:54,590
Heaven and hell are right here.
Behind every wall, every window.

411
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:59,760
The world behind the world,
and we're smack in the middle.

412
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:03,460
Angels and demons can't
cross over onto our plane.

413
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,580
So instead we get
what I call half-breeds.

414
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,940
<i>The influence peddlers.</i>

415
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:15,580
<i>They can only whisper in our ears, but
a single word can give you courage</i>

416
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,780
<i>or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.</i>

417
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,980
<i>Those with the demon's touch...</i>

418
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:28,230
<i>like those part angel,
living alongside us.</i>

419
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,890
They call it the balance.

420
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,430
I call it hypocritical bullshit.

421
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:38,570
So when a half-breed breaks the rules,

422
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,000
I deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

423
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:46,280
I don't get them all...

424
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:50,720
but I've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my...

425
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,750
- retirement.
- I don't understand.

426
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,890
I'm a suicide, Angela.

427
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,630
When I die, the rules say
I've got just one place to go.

428
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,830
You're trying to buy your way
into heaven.

429
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,470
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison

430
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,040
where half the inmates
were put there by you?

431
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,970
I guess God has a plan for all of us.

432
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,510
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

433
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,710
He's not planning anything.

434
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,110
When we were little...

435
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,680
Isabel saw things too.

436
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,560
Dodson.

437
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:39,590
Guard spotted him groping the body,
then he ran across the street.

438
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,870
Came in here, and he had a go
at the entire stock.

439
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,270
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

440
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,510
Could've been a member
of my fraternity.

441
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,920
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

442
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,710
He's okay.

443
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,830
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

444
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:45,200
Yes?

445
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:47,970
What do you mean?

446
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,400
What?

447
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,100
How?

448
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,750
Got it. Bye.

449
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:16,260
I need to see where Isabel died.

450
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,600
<i>Séances, Ouija boards, channeling.</i>

451
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:23,800
Our father thought she was
just trying to get attention.

452
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,510
She certainly did that.

453
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:30,240
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

454
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,110
She'd scare my mother half to death.

455
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,580
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

456
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,020
So you had her committed.

457
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,490
Yeah.

458
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,320
How long?

459
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,390
Two weeks.

460
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:48,660
This time.

461
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:53,400
She'd get better, and then she'd
get worse. Recently, a lot worse.

462
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:59,040
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand,

463
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,510
does it have something to do with this?

464
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,110
I'm a cop, John, remember?

465
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:09,220
You don't walk off the roof of a building
without leaving something behind.

466
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:14,260
And I showed you everything
she left behind in that box, but feel free.

467
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:19,760
Maybe she left something else.
Not something a cop would find.

468
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,130
Something just for you.

469
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,830
You were her twin, Angela.
Twins tend to think alike.

470
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,340
- I'm not like my sister.
- But you were once.

471
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,710
When you were kids.

472
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:37,780
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

473
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,720
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

474
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,350
That was a long time ago.

475
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,720
- That kind of bond doesn't just disappear.
- There is nothing here.

476
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:51,490
- Hey. Come on.
- She planned her death in this room.

477
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:55,060
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

478
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:58,460
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw,

479
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,700
feel what she felt,
know what she knew.

480
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:04,700
- What did she do, Angela?
- How should I know?

481
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,280
- What did she do, Angela?
- I don't know.

482
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,770
- What would you do?
- I don't know.

483
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:16,720
What did she do, Angela? You know
what she did. What did she do, Angela?

484
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,190
You know what she did. What are
you afraid of? What did she do?

485
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,690
- What did she do?
- I don't know!

486
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,570
When we were girls...

487
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,380
we would leave each other messages.

488
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,920
In light.

489
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:57,320
In breath.

490
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,260
On the windows.

491
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,800
John, there is no 17th act
in Corinthians.

492
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,740
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

493
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,050
They have Bibles in hell.

494
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,110
<i>Paints a different view of Revelations.</i>

495
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,420
<i>Says the world will not end
by God's hand,</i>

496
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:28,580
<i>but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.</i>

497
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,230
<i>Though if you ask me,</i>

498
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,830
fire's fire.

499
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,260
<i>16:29, 16:30.</i>

500
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,460
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

501
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,510
"The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son."

502
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,640
- Whose son?
- But he can't cross over, B.

503
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,440
- Impossible to cross over.
- Whose son? God's son?

504
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:56,050
No, the other one. Devil had a son too.

505
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,910
Here it is.

506
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:00,150
This is the sign of Mammon,

507
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:04,790
the son of the devil.
Well, hold on, it says here...

508
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,460
<i>- Beeman?</i>
- Yeah.

509
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,620
Sorry, I'm...
I'm sorry, no, I'm right here.

510
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:17,370
It says Mammon has no patience
for his father's rule

511
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:23,480
and yearns to forge his own kingdom
of fire and blood.

512
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:33,850
Yeah. Mammon would be
the last demon we'd ever want crossing over
to our plane.

513
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:37,650
No, wait, wait, wait. I'm reading.
Seems to be a loophole.

514
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:40,160
Always a catch.

515
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:46,870
It says first Mammon would have to
possess a very, very powerful psychic.

516
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,670
- Isabel.
<i>- But that wouldn't be enough.</i>

517
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:54,870
To cross over, Mammon would need
divine assistance.

518
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:00,450
To cross over, Mammon would need
the help of God.

519
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:04,420
- The help of God?
<i>- It says...</i>

520
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,650
<i>- Beeman?</i>
- John, look...

521
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:19,360
I know you've never had much faith,
you've never had much reason to,

522
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:23,270
<i>but that doesn't mean
that we don't have faith...</i>

523
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,910
in you.

524
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:31,710
Beeman? Beeman?

525
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,740
Drive. Fast.

526
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,840
Beeman!

527
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,970
Sulfur.

528
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,040
Beeman!

529
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:03,940
Beeman!

530
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:16,220
Wasn't just Isabel.

531
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,050
I used to see things too.

532
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,820
But...

533
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:26,860
- you already knew that, didn't you?
- Go home, Angela.

534
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,470
I need to understand.

535
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:31,120
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

536
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,400
I'm stronger than Isabel.

537
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:37,530
Your sister embraced her gift,
you denied yours. Denial is a better idea.

538
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:42,480
It's why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that will change.

539
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:47,310
- I don't need another ghost following me.
- John, they killed my sister.

540
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,010
I'd trade places with her if I could.

541
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:59,860
I used to pretend that I didn't.

542
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,930
That I didn't see things.

543
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,890
And...

544
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,370
by the time we were 10,
they started forcing her to take

545
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,200
antipsychotics

546
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:16,580
and have treatments.
They would come for her

547
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:20,480
and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me, "Tell them.

548
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:24,490
Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them too?"

549
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:26,990
But I lied.

550
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,850
I said:

551
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,730
"I don't see anything."

552
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:36,860
Until one day...

553
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,570
I finally stopped seeing.

554
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:44,430
I abandoned her, John.

555
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,700
I left her all alone.

556
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:57,240
I need to see what she saw.

557
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,810
Please.

558
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:08,890
You do this, there's no turning back.

559
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,790
You see them,

560
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,630
they see you.

561
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,490
Understand?

562
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,930
Yeah.

563
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,940
Sure.

564
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:12,010
So do I have to take the rest of
my clothes off, or can I leave them on?

565
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,090
John?

566
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:22,330
I'm thinking.

567
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:27,960
John?

568
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:30,630
On is fine.

569
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,810
- So why water?
- It's a universal conduit.

570
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:51,060
Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

571
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:55,490
- Now ask me if there's water in hell.
- Is there water in hell?

572
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,770
Sit.

573
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:04,400
Normally, only a portion of the body
has to be suspended,

574
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,010
but you wanted the crash course.

575
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,880
Yeah, I wanted the crash course.

576
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,140
So...

577
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,610
So, what's gonna happen?

578
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:18,450
Lie down.

579
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:22,590
- What do you mean lie down?
- You have to be fully submerged.

580
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,060
For how long?

581
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,530
As long as it takes.

582
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,730
Take a deep one.

583
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:25,310
Oh, God.

584
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:29,110
Oh, God, all those people.

585
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:32,150
Oh, Isabel.

586
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:33,950
I've always known.

587
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,650
I've always known where they are.
I've always known where to find them...

588
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:41,960
where to aim and where to duck

589
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:46,330
and I've always known
where they were.
I've always known that it wasn't luck.

590
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,030
Always known that it wasn't luck.
I've always known...

591
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:52,400
I've always known that I could see.

592
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:57,880
I've always known that I could see.

593
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:04,510
Angela.

594
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:10,760
Someone was here.

595
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,640
It was his.

596
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,820
Rolling.

597
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,830
Not a ball.

598
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,460
Something smaller.

599
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,860
Shiny.

600
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:28,930
Balthazar.

601
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,800
Sorry.

602
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:12,210
Can you just kill him?

603
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:14,480
What about the balance?

604
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:18,310
Half-breed tipped the scales
when he started killing my friends.

605
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:20,960
I'm just adding some counterweight.

606
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,880
John, I really want...

607
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,090
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

608
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,800
I'm coming with you.

609
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:19,580
You're staying in the car.

610
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:46,880
Fire? I was born of this.

611
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:51,580
How's Mammon crossing over,
you half-breed piece of shit?

612
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:59,040
That's better. Au naturel.

613
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,390
"Stay in the car."

614
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,930
"Wait here."

615
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:12,960
Men.

616
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,120
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

617
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,710
Enjoy it.

618
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:08,950
We'll see you very soon.

619
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,220
Not really, no.

620
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:16,560
You can't cheat it this time.
You're going back to hell.

621
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:18,260
True.

622
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,730
But you're not.

623
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:24,160
- What are you doing?
- I'm reading you your last rites.

624
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:28,000
Spare me your remedial incantations.

625
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,510
You do know what it is
to truly be forgiven?

626
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,240
To be welcomed
into the Kingdom of God.

627
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,810
Demon in heaven.

628
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:39,450
I'd love to be a fly on that wall.

629
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:43,850
You're not a priest. You have no power.

630
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:50,490
Just tell me how Mammon
is crossing over and you can go back
to your shithole.

631
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:56,690
Okay, Bally, enjoy it.

632
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:11,820
"May God have mercy on you
and grant you the pardon of all your sins.

633
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:16,830
Whose soever sins you remit on Earth,
they are remitted unto them in heaven."

634
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,660
- How? How's he doing it?
- No.

635
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:23,060
No, I can't.

636
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:28,300
Grant your child entry
into thy kingdom,

637
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:33,910
in the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

638
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:36,140
Amen!

639
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:42,310
The blood of God.

640
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,750
He found it.

641
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:48,180
Whatever killed the son of God

642
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:53,890
will give birth to the son of the devil.

643
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:57,860
By the way,

644
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:03,770
you have to ask for absolution
to be forgiven...

645
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,970
asshole.

646
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,340
My work here is done.

647
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:19,550
- What are you laughing at?
- She was my only mission

648
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:23,920
and you brought her right to us.

649
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,230
So does this walking fast
mean you've found something?

650
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,700
Jesus didn't die from being nailed to a
cross. He was killed by a soldier's spear.

651
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:37,000
The Spear of Destiny.

652
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,140
I'm a Catholic, John.
I know the Crucifixion story.

653
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:53,890
I drew out the sister as you asked.

654
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:59,650
She's been made flush and ready.

655
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:03,600
So much power.

656
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:09,100
Now, if you grant me my resurrection,
I shall serve.

657
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:15,200
Wait. But I did as we agreed.

658
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:19,010
No. Please. No!

659
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:26,850
Beeman said Mammon needed
divine assistance to cross over.

660
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:31,420
How's the blood of God's only son?

661
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:34,090
The stains on the spear.

662
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,270
- Yeah.
- So he gets the spear.

663
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:40,600
He still has to locate
a powerful psychic.

664
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:43,260
Not really.

665
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:47,670
Twins.

666
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,240
Where's the amulet?

667
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,610
I don't know,
I must have left it in the...

668
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,580
What's wrong?

669
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,850
I don't know, I just feel...

670
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,410
- Bird on a ladder.
- Sorry.

671
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:42,190
- Wait here.
- Yeah.

672
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,300
Who's a rat in a dress now, huh, bitch?

673
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:05,780
- Have you lost what little mind you have?
- Don't.

674
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:10,250
I need to use the chair.

675
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:14,450
I offer no aid to one side or the other.

676
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:18,230
- The balance.
- Screw the balance.

677
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:26,800
You dare? In my house?

678
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:32,980
Is this neutral? Bullshit.

679
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:36,120
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

680
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:40,050
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

681
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:44,620
Hennessy, Beeman, they were
your friends once too, remember?

682
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:48,420
I need your help!

683
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:53,090
Consider it a last request.

684
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:59,740
You play a dangerous game.

685
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,880
Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way.

686
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,580
That little shit has been trying to climb
out of his father's shadow for eons.

687
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,660
I'd hate to think what he would do
to this world if he ever broke through.

688
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:26,130
Forgot how big it was.

689
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:30,940
Two hundred souls passed through
this wood and steel at Sing Sing.

690
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,940
Yeah.

691
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:38,140
Which way's east?

692
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:58,630
How many years since you've surfed?

693
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:01,840
Like riding a bike.

694
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
No, not really.

695
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:09,510
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

696
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:15,050
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

697
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:22,860
Cold.

698
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:25,120
Little flavor?

699
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:50,540
- Sure about this?
- No.

700
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:42,400
Midnite!

701
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:51,240
- Any luck?
- That's a word for it.

702
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:54,980
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite,
aren't you?

703
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:07,130
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

704
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,360
Well, they did not leave her unguarded.

705
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:18,340
Half-breeds are most vulnerable
when their outer skin is breached
by holy water.

706
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:22,500
Certain objects, most notably
either of the two crosses of Isteria,

707
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:26,840
have been used by even
the unordained to bless
commonly occurring waters,

708
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:28,780
even rain.

709
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,680
Maybe if...

710
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,780
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

711
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,830
You wouldn't have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet,

712
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,060
maybe we could take with us?

713
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:49,760
Look, John, no offense, I just don't think
that it's a great idea, you know...

714
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:53,270
you going on a solo mission
to save the world. That's my vote.

715
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,140
I don't know what pops thinks,
but that's...

716
01:23:57,450 --> 01:24:00,510
Take him, John. Kill him after.

717
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:09,920
If you get back, see me
about membership. Maybe.

718
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:13,030
Okay. I will.

719
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:20,060
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

720
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,200
Praying. Okay.

721
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:25,770
Come on.

722
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,320
Half-breeds, right?

723
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:31,700
A birth like this, they're definitely
gonna be guarding her, right? Definitely.

724
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,630
Yeah.

725
01:25:36,650 --> 01:25:41,140
We can get through them. I mean,
that cross has gotta work, right?

726
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:42,980
Right?

727
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,690
It's not always like it is in the books.

728
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:36,830
What is that?

729
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:39,330
Hellspeak.

730
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:44,040
You know what to do.

731
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,940
I'm okay.

732
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:52,550
Sure.

733
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:06,960
One last show.

734
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:42,530
Hi.

735
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:44,430
My name's John.

736
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:50,170
You are in violation of the balance.

737
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:53,410
Leave immediately...

738
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,340
or I will deport you.

739
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,150
All of you.

740
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:09,460
Go to hell.

741
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:16,570
Holy water?

742
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:36,480
Angela.

743
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:10,410
John?

744
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:14,050
John.

745
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,320
Shit.

746
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:48,090
Pull!

747
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,320
Angela.

748
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:55,980
Angela, what is it?

749
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,000
Get it out.

750
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,000
Get it out.

751
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:22,610
Get it...

752
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:07,920
Oh, my God.

753
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:16,760
Not bad, kid.

754
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:21,770
"Not bad." You hear that?

755
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:26,380
You know why that is? It's because
this is Kramer. Chas Kramer, ass...

756
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,160
Chas.

757
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:46,760
You're right, John.

758
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,730
It's not like the books.

759
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:52,530
No...

760
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:55,310
it isn't.

761
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:19,030
Into the light, I command thee.

762
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:23,530
Into the light, I command thee.

763
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:28,800
Into the light, I command thee.

764
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:36,980
Into the light, I command thee.

765
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:43,060
Your ego is astounding.

766
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,160
Gabriel.

767
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:46,520
Figures.

768
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:51,170
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

769
01:34:51,330 --> 01:34:53,730
You judging me now, John?

770
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

771
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:03,130
I am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

772
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:07,210
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

773
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,250
Help me here.

774
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:17,590
You're handed this precious gift, right?

775
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:22,850
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

776
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:26,390
Murderers, rapists and molesters,

777
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:28,900
all of you, you just have to repent

778
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:31,900
and God takes you into his bosom.

779
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,470
In all the worlds in all the universe,

780
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,580
no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

781
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:43,380
It's not fair.

782
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:51,490
If sweet, sweet God loves you so,

783
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:54,690
then I'll make you worthy of his love.

784
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:59,460
I've been watching you for a long time.

785
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:04,300
It's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

786
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:08,310
And you can be so noble.

787
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:12,600
So...

788
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,610
I'll bring you pain.

789
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:18,650
I'll bring you horror.

790
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:23,450
So that you may rise above it.

791
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:30,830
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth

792
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,970
will be worthy of God's love.

793
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:35,930
Gabriel...

794
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:38,640
you're insane.

795
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:43,770
The road to salvation begins tonight.

796
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:46,280
Right now.

797
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,950
I know I'm not one of your favorites.

798
01:37:32,490 --> 01:37:35,220
I'm not even welcome in your house.

799
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:39,660
But I could use a little attention.

800
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,670
Please.

801
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:33,420
Come forth.

802
01:38:53,170 --> 01:38:55,070
Hurry.

803
01:39:12,290 --> 01:39:14,160
Mammon,

804
01:39:14,330 --> 01:39:16,800
son of Satan,

805
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:21,420
I unleash you unto this world.

806
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:16,520
Lu.

807
01:40:16,690 --> 01:40:18,780
What took you so long?

808
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:21,220
Hello, John.

809
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:25,260
John, hello.

810
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:33,070
You're the one soul

811
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:37,070
I would come up here
to collect myself.

812
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:42,810
So I've heard.

813
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:44,880
You mind?

814
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,320
Oh, go... Go right ahead. I've got stock.

815
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:50,720
Coffin nail.

816
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:53,090
Very fitting, John.

817
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,520
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons...

818
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:02,500
finger movement goes
out the window.

819
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:04,730
Let me help you.

820
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:17,710
See?

821
01:41:19,550 --> 01:41:20,950
Sonny...

822
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:26,250
I've got a whole theme park
full of red delights for you.

823
01:41:26,990 --> 01:41:28,550
Well, aren't you a peach.

824
01:41:30,330 --> 01:41:34,200
I didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

825
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,970
And you didn't,

826
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:43,470
did you?

827
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:45,410
So how's the family?

828
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:51,520
Family's doing just fine.
Busy, busy, busy. Need a vacation.

829
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:55,380
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

830
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:58,580
Well, one does what one can.

831
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:00,390
He's in the other room.

832
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,330
Boys will be boys.

833
01:42:04,530 --> 01:42:05,900
With Gabriel.

834
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:11,500
No accounting for taste, really.

835
01:42:11,910 --> 01:42:14,310
They have the Spear of Destiny.

836
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:20,780
"They have the Spear of Destiny."

837
01:42:29,090 --> 01:42:32,290
Or is it another one of your cons?

838
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,660
Go look for yourself.

839
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:43,330
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu...

840
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,760
what's another 20 seconds?

841
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:56,700
- Lucifer.
- This world is mine. In time.

842
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,440
You, best of all of us, Gabriel,

843
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:04,850
should understand ambition.

844
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:07,510
Son of perdition.

845
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,720
Little horn.

846
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:14,060
Most unclean.

847
01:44:14,230 --> 01:44:16,860
I do miss the old names.

848
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:19,930
Time to go home, son.

849
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:22,570
I will smite thee...

850
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:25,640
in his honor.

851
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:35,910
Looks like somebody doesn't
have your back anymore.

852
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:54,900
Father?

853
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,360
So.

854
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:28,700
So.

855
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:32,830
Yeah, what do you want? An extension?

856
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:39,600
The sister...

857
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:41,840
Isabel.

858
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,680
What about her?

859
01:45:47,690 --> 01:45:50,120
Let her go home.

860
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:57,390
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to heaven?

861
01:46:07,210 --> 01:46:10,230
Fine. It's done.

862
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:16,340
Time to go, John.

863
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,310
Yeah.

864
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:18,130
The sacrifice.

865
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:35,750
No. This one belongs to me.

866
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:51,580
No. You will live, John Constantine.

867
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:56,080
You will live.

868
01:47:58,650 --> 01:48:01,120
So you will have...

869
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:05,450
the chance to prove...

870
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:13,470
that your soul truly belongs in hell.

871
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:19,600
Oh, you will live.

872
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:27,850
You will live.

873
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:43,580
Thank you.

874
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:47,960
No problem.

875
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:05,770
Human.

876
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:10,240
You don't deserve to be human.

877
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:16,450
Do you want revenge?
Is that what you're thinking right now?

878
01:50:18,930 --> 01:50:20,480
Do it.

879
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,320
Do it.

880
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:27,030
Seek revenge.

881
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:29,500
End my life.

882
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:31,760
Go on.

883
01:50:33,870 --> 01:50:35,400
Be the hand of God.

884
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:37,940
It's your choice.

885
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:40,340
It's always been your choice.

886
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:47,090
Yeah.

887
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:55,130
That's called pain.

888
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:56,660
Get used to it.

889
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:05,260
You could've shot me, John!

890
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:10,280
You chose a higher path!

891
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:14,480
Look how well you're doing!

892
01:51:40,010 --> 01:51:42,030
Nice spot.

893
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:47,800
I have something for you.

894
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:53,580
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

895
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:59,180
Oh, how thoughtful.

896
01:52:04,470 --> 01:52:06,300
John...

897
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:10,070
why are you giving me this?

898
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,700
Rules.

899
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:13,500
Hide it.

900
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:16,700
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

901
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:19,410
Not even me.

902
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:25,380
Always a catch.

903
01:52:26,850 --> 01:52:28,410
Yeah.

904
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:43,370
So.

905
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:48,030
I've got some cleaning up to do.

906
01:52:51,850 --> 01:52:53,840
I'll...

907
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:56,310
see you around.

908
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:00,750
I'd like that.

909
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:33,620
<i>I guess there's a plan for all of us.</i>

910
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:35,450
<i>I had to die...</i>

911
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:36,850
<i>twice...</i>

912
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:39,220
<i>just to figure that out.</i>

913
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:44,420
<i>Like the book says, he works his work
in mysterious ways.</i>

914
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,760
<i>Some people like it...</i>

915
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:49,460
<i>some people don't.</i>

916
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:44,980
You did good, kid.
