00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:18,978
<i>This is Berk, boasting the
kind of balmy, fun-in-the-sun climate</i>

3
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:21,773
<i>that will give you frostbite
on your spleen.</i>

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,818
<i>The one upside is our
annual holiday.</i>

5
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:27,237
<i>We call it Snoggletog.</i>

6
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:30,365
<i>Why we chose such a stupid name
remains a mystery.</i>

7
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:33,326
<i>But with the war long over...</i>

8
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:36,746
<i>and dragons living amongst us,
this year's Snoggletog...</i>

9
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,459
<i>promises to be one to remember.</i>

10
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,837
OK, OK! I'm coming!

11
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:54,097
- Good morning, Mr. Bossy.

12
00:00:56,266 --> 00:01:00,353
Do you always have to wake me up
so early to go flying...?

13
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,356
Stupid leg.

14
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:05,900
Thanks, buddy. I'm OK.

15
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,986
- Yeah, we can go flying now.

16
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:10,739
Eww! Eww!
What?! Eww!

17
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,615
Toothless!

18
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,580
Come on!
Let's see what you got today!

19
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,671
Yeah! OK, you ready?

20
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,424
Easy...

21
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:36,306
Yes! Finally!

22
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:41,561
Yes, yes... No, no!
That one a wee bit higher!

23
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,898
- Here?
- There! That's the spot!

24
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:46,483
Roar!

25
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,071
Attaboy, Meatlug.

26
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:54,282
Are you ready, girl?

27
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,121
By Odin's beard, Gobber,

28
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,832
Vikings spending the winter holiday
with dragons!

29
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:06,836
- What would the fathers say?
- They'd think we'd lost our minds.

30
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:10,757
Well done! Well done. All of you!

31
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:15,678
I never thought I'd live to see this
peace on the island of Berk.

32
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:19,390
This will surely be the greatest holiday
we've ever seen.

33
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,937
What the...?

34
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,281
What in Thor's name?

35
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:40,537
Come back! What are you doing?

36
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,997
Meatlug!

37
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,001
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

38
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,545
Where's Hiccup?

39
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:52,090
What do you say, bud?
Wanna go again?

40
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:54,050
- Whoa!

41
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,593
Whoa!

42
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,513
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

43
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:01,850
Oh, no, my helmet!

44
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,646
Whoa!

45
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:09,524
Toothless! No, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

46
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,402
Whoa, whoa, wait! Toothless! Stop!

47
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,571
We'll get it later, buddy.

48
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:17,574
We need to get back
and find out what's going on.

49
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:24,289
What's the matter?
Where are you going?

50
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:28,543
No, no, no, don't leave, Stormfly!
Don't go! Please?

51
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,674
- Astrid!
- Hiccup! What's going on?

52
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,843
Where are they going?

53
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,013
- Why did they leave?
- What's happening?!

54
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,222
What if they never come back?!

55
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:42,765
- Stop, please!
- Calm down!

56
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:45,310
Give him a chance to speak!

57
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:47,228
Hiccup, where are all the dragons going?

58
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:50,773
Dad, I don't know.

59
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:09,000
Where'd they go?
Snoggletog is ruined!

60
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,752
It's not ruined!

61
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,129
We're Vikings!

62
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:17,675
We've been perfectly happy celebrating
without dragons for generations.

63
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:20,470
And there's no reason
we can't do it again.

64
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:22,513
Now, we don't know
where they've gone off to.

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,434
But we have to have faith
that they'll be back again soon.

66
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,562
- Am I right?
- You're right! We are Vikings!

67
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,900
- We're tough... most of the time.

68
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,986
Let's sing
some Snoggletog songs.

69
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:40,990
- That was depressing.
- I know.

70
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:43,993
I was looking forward to spending
the holiday with Stormfly.

71
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:49,248
What are you so happy about?
Don't you miss Meatlug?

72
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,084
Me?

73
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,169
Oh, yeah.

74
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:56,756
I miss him so much!

75
00:04:58,383 --> 00:04:59,801
Well, good night.

76
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:07,308
I've got an idea. Let's come up
with a bunch of new holiday traditions.

77
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:11,062
- You know, to bury the sadness.

78
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,147
Actually, Astrid might
be onto something.

79
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,859
Easy for you to say. Your dragon
can't go anywhere without you.

80
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,572
Must be nice.

81
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:32,291
Yak nog! Get your yak nog!

82
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,837
Come on! Get a frothy, delicious
cup of cheer!

83
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:39,799
Hey, you guys, try this tasty new
beverage I made for the holiday.

84
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:43,720
- What's the smell? Is that you?
- It's yak nog!

85
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:47,849
If I drink that,
I'm gonna yak nog all over the place.

86
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:51,144
Maybe you'd rather taste
a punch in the face?

87
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,564
Astrid, it sounds delightful.
I'd love a mug.

88
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,444
You can really taste the yak.

89
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,031
- Yum! What is that?
- You wanna try some?

90
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,074
It's my new traditional drink.

91
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,493
Oh, you know...

92
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,205
suddenly and inexplicably
changed my mind.

93
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,791
Well, you don't know
what you're missing.

94
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,334
I bet Hiccup will love this.

95
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,462
Are you crying?

96
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,300
- Hiccup?
- Yeah, I'm over here, Astrid. Coming.

97
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,762
Here. Happy holidays.
From me to you.

98
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,847
- Thank you, milady.
- What are you up to?

99
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:30,099
OK, you're gonna think I'm crazy,

100
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,936
but I just couldn't stop thinking
about what Tuff nut said last night.

101
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,314
Toothless can't come and go
like the other dragons,

102
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:39,484
and that's just not fair.
I was up all night,

103
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,695
and I think I found a way to fix that.

104
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,324
No way! You built him a new tail?

105
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,451
So he's gonna be able
to fly without you!

106
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:49,702
Mm-hmm.

107
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,330
Wow! What a great gift.

108
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,124
What if he never comes back?

109
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:59,879
- What am I saying? Of course he will.
- Mm-hmm.

110
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:04,759
Well, I'm gonna go spread some more
holiday cheer. You're amazing!

111
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:24,904
Toothless! Come on down, bud!
I got something for you.

112
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:28,533
What do you think of that? Yeah.

113
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:32,036
Would you just settle down!

114
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:35,331
Toothless, come on, bud.
Let me get this on you.

115
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:38,501
Yeah. You are going to love this.

116
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,837
OK.

117
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:45,633
No, no, no! Toothless, stop!
Please, wait! Toothless, please!

118
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:53,850
There you go. See? Got it?

119
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,525
Toothless... Whoa!

120
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,850
Toothless!

121
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:37,268
I knew you'd come back!

122
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:39,228
Whoa!

123
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:41,731
Morning, son.

124
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,275
Hey, Dad.

125
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:47,612
Glad you're up.
I was looking for your helmet.

126
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:49,238
My... my helmet?

127
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:52,116
Odin needs a place to put your goodies.

128
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:55,286
Yeah, right, I'll... get on that.

129
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:56,495
Great.

130
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,123
Hold on.

131
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,211
Hold on. All right, come on.

132
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,712
What's on your mind? Out with it.

133
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,341
It's been three days, Dad.

134
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,052
I just thought Toothless
would be back by now.

135
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:15,973
- I'm sure he's with the other dragons.
- Yeah? I wish I could be that sure.

136
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:21,395
Listen, I know what it's like to miss
someone you love this time of year.

137
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,732
But what do we do when they can't
be here for the holiday?

138
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,817
We celebrate them.

139
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,821
And I imagine that's exactly what
Toothless would want you to do.

140
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:33,908
- Right?
- You're right.

141
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,702
Good. Now go get that helmet.

142
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,497
We've had enough disappointment
around here.

143
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:53,761
Oh, Fishlegs, you hungry? There's
enough fish there to feed a dragon.

144
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,474
A dragon! That's...

145
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:25,459
Meatlug!

146
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,255
Whoa!

147
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,716
Hiccup? Where are you going?

148
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,552
I have no idea!

149
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,639
Meatlug! What about presents?

150
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,433
Hey!

151
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,395
- I can't believe him.
- You can't believe him?!

152
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:47,606
- You kidnapped your dragon!
- That makes it sound mean.

153
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,192
- Hey, guys...
- He flew away the second

154
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,653
- he was unleashed!
- I'm 72 per cent sure

155
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,904
he wanted to stay.

156
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,115
- Guys!
- Whoa!

157
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:58,117
Meatlug barfed up a pile of rocks.

158
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:01,996
You're such an idiot. Those aren't
rocks. Your dragon laid eggs!

159
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,832
Hey, wait. I bet that's
why the dragons left.

160
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,835
- To lay their eggs.
- But boy dragons don't lay eggs.

161
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,047
Yeah, your boy dragon
is a girl dragon.

162
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,382
OK! That actually explains a few things.

163
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:16,260
Hey! Everyone's missing their dragons,
right?

164
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,471
- Here it comes.
- I've got an idea.

165
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,932
It'll be another new
Snoggletog tradition.

166
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,061
This is gonna be so good!

167
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,833
Meatlug, where are you taking me?

168
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,914
You guys come here to have babies.

169
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:34,713
Whoa.

170
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,382
Hmm.

171
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,482
- Wow!

172
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:59,405
Hey, look over here. You missed one.

173
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,323
Whoa!

174
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,458
Man, it's a good things
don't hatch on Berk.

175
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,677
- Wasn't this a great idea?
- Uh-huh!

176
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,471
Everyone is gonna be
so surprised!

177
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,056
Ow!

178
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,933
Surprise!

179
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:33,397
Aww!

180
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,524
The eggs explode?

181
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,778
The eggs explode!

182
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,241
Sorry!

183
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,202
Sorry!

184
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,501
Save us!

185
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,008
- Awesome!
- Wow!

186
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,594
This is your best idea yet.

187
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,727
What in Thor's name is going on?!

188
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:14,355
The eggs explode.

189
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,193
Toothless!

190
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,861
Toothless?

191
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,782
Come on, Toothless, where are you?

192
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,581
Hookfang!

193
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,001
Stormfly.

194
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:42,633
You have no idea how happy I am
to see you guys.

195
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,761
And you have... babies?

196
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:49,056
Look at you guys, all happy together.

197
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:57,189
Who knew you were leaving to celebrate
your own sort of... holiday?

198
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,110
I should get back to my holiday.

199
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,153
So, what do you say there, Hookfang?

200
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,698
Think you can give me
a ride back home?

201
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:15,082
I'll see you all back on Berk
when you're good and ready. OK, gang?

202
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:22,256
No, no! No, no, no! I... think
I just started the return migration.

203
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,014
Well, if you insist.

204
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,813
Come on!

205
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,861
Boy, this is never gonna work.

206
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,869
Hold on. I've got just the thing

207
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,543
Gobber, this is a disaster.

208
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,920
- It's not so bad.
- Not that bad?

209
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,549
The village is destroyed,
the dragons have gone and left us...

210
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,260
Let's face it.
This holiday is a complete...

211
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:10,638
What are these people looking at?

212
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:14,725
What is that?

213
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:23,525
It's Hiccup!

214
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,571
And our dragons!

215
00:16:56,934 --> 00:17:00,104
- Welcome back, laddie!
- Good job!

216
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,815
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

217
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,659
Meatlug!

218
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,912
Stormfly! You're back! Oh!

219
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:20,082
And there are babies!

220
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,378
- Well done, son.
- Thanks, Dad.

221
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:28,090
Everyone, grab your dragons!
To the Great Hall!

222
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,551
We finally have something to celebrate.

223
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:40,352
This the best holiday ever!

224
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,231
Who's a baby? Who's a cutie baby?

225
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:54,408
Hiccup, I know this must
be really hard for you,

226
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,077
seeing everyone with their dragons.

227
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:00,122
But you really did a wonderful thing!

228
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,790
Thank you.

229
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,628
Astrid, where did Toothless go?

230
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,756
- I don't know.

231
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,599
Wow. Man!

232
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,684
Wouldn't wanna be you right now.

233
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:25,355
I mean, you brought back
everyone's dragon except yours.

234
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,817
Yeah, you know,
this is not helping at all.

235
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,489
Toothless! Hey, bud!

236
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,537
- Stoick.

237
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,125
Bad dragon! Very bad dragon!

238
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,504
You scared me to death!
Don't ever stay away that long again!

239
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,923
And what is in your mouth?

240
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,467
Eww! Eww!

241
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,265
Yeah, you found my helmet.

242
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,227
Hey! You found my helmet!

243
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,395
That's where you've been?

244
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,232
Buddy, thank you.

245
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,025
You are amazing.

246
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,243
Happy Snoggletog!

247
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,679
I'm coming, Toothless!

248
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,807
All right, bud, come on down.
I was just...

249
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,938
Toothless, what'd you pull this out for?
You don't need this any more.

250
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,690
Come on, let's get going.

251
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:58,365
Would you quit fooling around?
You have your new tail now.

252
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:01,118
Toothless!

253
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,795
Toothless! Stop! What are you doing?!

254
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,226
<i>Winter in Berk lasts
most of the year.</i>

255
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,271
<i>It hangs on with both hands
and won't let go.</i>

256
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,024
<i>And the only real comforts
against the cold</i>

257
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,151
<i>are those you keep
close to your heart.</i>

258
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,361
OK, bud, you ready?

259
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,240
Yee-haw!

260
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,290
<i>Turns out that was
the best Snoggletog ever.</i>

261
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:52,336
<i>That year, I gave my best friend
a pretty great gift.</i>

262
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,174
Whoo-hoo!

263
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,262
<i>He gave me a better one.</i>

263
00:21:03,305 --> 00:22:03,296
