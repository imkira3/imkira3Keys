00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:36,039
----@@@ greetings from scOrp @@@----

2
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,039
...and I’ll telic you what,
the storm system's still moving west.

3
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:43,126
What are you looking at, Caroline?

4
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,753
The wind, Mom.

5
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,259
They say the hurricane is coming.

6
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,055
I’m on a boat.

7
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,474
I’m drifting.

8
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,104
Can I do anything for you, Mom?

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,315
Make anything easier?

10
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,693
Oh, sugar. . .

11
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,487
There's nothing left to do.

12
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,614
Is what it is.

13
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,077
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open.

14
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:23,166
My mouth's full of cotton.

15
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,835
There, there, Miss Daisy.

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,671
You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons.

17
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,387
Do you want any more
medication, Mother?

18
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,475
Doctor said you could have
as much as you want.

19
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,852
No need for anybody to suffer.

20
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,745
A friend told me
that she never had the chance

21
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,164
to say goodbye to her mother.

22
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,628
-I wanted to. . .
-It’s okay.

23
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,256
I wanted to telic you
how much I’m gonna miss you so. . .

24
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,841
Mom.

25
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,595
Oh, Caroline.

26
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,894
Are you afraid?

27
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,729
I’m curious.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,107
What comes next?

29
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:40,409
They built the train station in 1918.

30
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,205
My father was there the day it opened.

31
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,584
He said they had

32
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,796
a tuba band playing.

33
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:00,638
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

34
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,058
to build that glorious clock.

35
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,478
His name was...

36
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,190
Mr. Gateau.

37
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,737
Mr. Cake.

38
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:23,452
He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish

39
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,788
and they had a son.

40
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:32,837
Mr. Gateau was, from birth,
absolutely blind.

41
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,343
When their son was old enough,
he joined the army.

42
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:44,640
And they prayed God would
keep him out of harm's way.

43
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:52,315
For months,
he did nothing but work on that clock.

44
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,820
One day,

45
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,115
a letter came.

46
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,082
And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,

47
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,294
went up, alone, to bed.

48
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,758
And their son came home.

49
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,724
They buried him in the family plot,

50
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,728
where he would be with them
when their time came.

51
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,858
Mr. Cake worked on his clock,

52
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,323
laboring to finish.

53
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,536
It was a morning to remember.

54
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,999
Papa said
there were people everywhere.

55
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,003
Even Teddy Roosevelt came.

56
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,606
It’s running backwards!

57
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,985
I made it that way

58
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,446
so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war

59
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,906
might stand and come home again.

60
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,246
Home to farm,

61
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,581
work,

62
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,835
have children.

63
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,590
To live long, full lives.

64
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,471
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

65
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,691
I’m sorry if I’ve offended anybody.

66
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,528
I hope you enjoy my clock.

67
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,283
Mr. Cake was never seen again.

68
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:16,083
Some say he died of a broken heart.

69
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,129
Some say he went to sea.

70
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,385
Excuse me.

71
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,055
Do you mind if I make a call?
Somebody's watching my little boy.

72
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,431
Sure.

73
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,902
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

74
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,113
You couldn't disappoint me.

75
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:52,453
Well, I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

76
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,458
Find my dark suitcase.

77
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,715
There's a diary.

78
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,968
This?

79
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,599
Could you read it to me?

80
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,393
Is this what you want to do?

81
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,397
I tried to read it
a hundred different times.

82
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,359
Mom, it's not exactly. . .

83
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,862
It’s just the sound of your voice, darling.

84
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,697
Okay.

85
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,829
It’s dated April 4th, 1 985.

86
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,290
And it says New Orleans.

87
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,127
"This is my last will and testament.

88
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:45,422
"I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money, really.

89
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:51,053
"I will go out of this world the same way
I came in, alone and with nothing.

90
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,597
"All I have is my story,

91
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,101
"and I’m writing it now
while I still remember it.

92
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,063
"My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button."

93
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,567
And I was born under
unusual circumstances.

94
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,736
The First World War had ended,

95
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:12,324
and I’ve been told it was
an especially good night to be born.

96
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,120
Thank God it's over!

97
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,038
We won the war!

98
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,763
The Great War is over!

99
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,027
What are you doing here?

100
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,445
Thomas,

101
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,114
I’m afraid she's going to die.

102
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,407
What?

103
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,204
That's enough.
All of you, get away from her.

104
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,501
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people.

105
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,878
Thomas.

106
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,964
Promise me he has a place.

107
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,509
Yeah.

108
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,888
She gave her life for me.

109
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,892
And for that, I am forever grateful.

110
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,903
Mr. Button.

111
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,419
Thomas!

112
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,796
Thomas.

113
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,967
Thomas? Where are you going?

114
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,914
Hey! What are you doing there?

115
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,209
What do you have there?

116
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,186
-Come on, Queenie.
-Now, Mr. Weathers!

117
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,647
Come on, now, you know I ain't got
nothing but work to do around here.

118
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,025
-Come on. Just take some time.
-Stop all this foolishness.

119
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,988
The air is sweet.

120
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,496
You look very handsome tonight,
Miss Queenie.

121
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,957
Handsome as I’ve ever seen.

122
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,628
The brown matches your eyes.

123
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,088
Oh, hush!

124
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:59,676
Let's see here.
You ain't no slouch yourself.

125
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,062
Hambert's back in town.

126
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,941
He came home legless, but he's home.

127
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,569
I know you were sweet on him one time.

128
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,947
Sweeter than I should've been.

129
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,949
Miss Simone messed herself.

130
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,283
Oh, sweet Jesus.

131
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,911
She got to stop doing that
or it's diapers for her.

132
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,080
-I’ll be right there, Miss Jameson!
-Now, Queenie, now come on.

133
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,749
Okay, Queenie'll be right there.

134
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,084
It’s awful nice out here.

135
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,421
Come on out back for a moment.
Take your mind off things.

136
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,547
You're so bad.

137
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,133
-What in God's name?
-What's this?

138
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,728
Oh, the Lord done something here.

139
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,315
Hope I didn't hurt it none
stepping on it like that.

140
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,942
We best leave that for the police.

141
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,569
Poor baby.

142
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,737
I’ll go.

143
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:05,075
It’s for sure nobody wanted to keep it.
Come on, baby.

144
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,164
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?

145
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,207
Hold your water! You go deal with it.

146
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,418
Okay. No, go, I’ll be back.

147
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,547
Queenie, Apple, she went and messed
herself all over again!

148
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,507
Jane Childress, start her a bath!

149
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,676
And mind your own business,
Mrs. Duprey.

150
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,595
You’ll be messing yourself
soon enough.

151
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,263
Somebody stole my necklace.

152
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,308
Okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister,
I’ll be right with you, okay?

153
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,602
Go on back upstairs, hear?

154
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,444
You are as ugly as an old pot

155
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,196
but you're still a child of God.

156
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,656
Queenie, Apple,
she won't take a bath without you!

157
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,241
Mercy.

158
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,327
I’ll be right there!

159
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,291
Okay. You just wait right here
for me now, okay?

160
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:02,257
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

161
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,178
-Somebody's been stealing my jewelry.
-They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?

162
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,598
Right around your pretty white neck.
Now, come on. Hush all that noise.

163
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,309
-Is Dr. Rose still here?
-I don't know.

164
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,396
Your heart is strong.

165
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,483
You just want to avoid
any undue stimulation.

166
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,195
I trust you ladies
will help me out with that?

167
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,448
I have something.
Could you come downstairs?

168
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,830
Never seen anything like it.
Nearly blind from cataracts.

169
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:38,001
I’m not sure if he can hear.
His bones indicate severe arthritis.

170
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:43,215
His skin has lost all elasticity,
and his hands and feet are ossified.

171
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,886
He shows all the deterioration,
the infirmities, not of a newborn,

172
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,639
but of a man well in his 80s
on his way to the grave.

173
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,723
He's dying?

174
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:55,102
His body is failing him
before his life's begun.

175
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,897
Where'd he come from?

176
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:03,360
My sister's child. From Lafayette.
She had an unfortunate adventure.

177
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:07,364
The poor child, he got the worst of it.
Come out white.

178
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:14,997
There are places for unwanted babies
like these, Queenie.

179
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,292
No room for another mouth to feed here.

180
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,919
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions,

181
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,797
thinks this place is
a large nuisance as it is.

182
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,091
-A baby. . .
-You said he don't have long.

183
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:30,762
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

184
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,894
No, this baby, he is a miracle.
That's for certain.

185
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,023
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

186
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,528
Y’all listen. Y’all listen up here.

187
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,322
We're gonna have us a visitor

188
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,533
that's gonna be staying with us
for a little while.

189
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,370
My sister had a child
and she couldn't see right by it, so. . .

190
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,374
He's known as. . .

191
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,881
Benjamin.

192
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,718
He's not a well child, so we're gonna
have to take good care of him.

193
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,886
I had 1 0 children.

194
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,348
There's not a baby I can't care for.
Let me see him.

195
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:20,187
God in Heaven.
He looks just like my ex-husband.

196
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,649
Look, he's prematurely old.

197
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,694
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much more
time on this earth.

198
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,154
Join the club.

199
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,744
He's smiling!

200
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,170
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

201
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,307
Are you right out of your mind?

202
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,978
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

203
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,313
but this ain't yours to keep.

204
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,691
It may not even be humankind.

205
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,244
Mr. Weathers, come back here.

206
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,789
Please.

207
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,725
You never know what's coming for you.

208
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,112
It seemed I had found a home.

209
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,324
Is any of this true?

210
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,828
You have such a lovely voice.

211
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:05,041
Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token.

212
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,880
That clock just kept going,

213
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,093
year after year after year.

214
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,266
But I didn't know I was a child.

215
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,852
Same old crap every day.

216
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,522
I thought I was like everyone else there.

217
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,692
An old man in the twilight of his life.

218
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,153
Could you make him stop that?

219
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,199
Stop banging that fork.
It’s used for eating, not for playing with.

220
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,160
And use your napkin, please,
Mr. Benjamin.

221
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,789
Queenie!

222
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,177
Hey, boy.

223
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,853
Always had a healthy curiosity.

224
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,483
What was up the street?
Or around the next corner?

225
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,653
Go get him!

226
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,448
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here.

227
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,909
Stay put, child.

228
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,247
I loved her very much.

229
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,666
She was my mother.

230
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,752
Mama.

231
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:35,340
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

232
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,804
Everybody feels different about
themselves, one way or another.

233
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,099
But we're all going the same way.

234
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,104
Just taking different roads to get there,
that's all.

235
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,690
You're on your own road, Benjamin.

236
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,112
Mama? How much longer I got?

237
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,907
Just be thankful
for what you're given, hear?

238
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:04,119
You're already here longer
than you're supposed to.

239
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,916
Some nights, I’d have to sleep alone.

240
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,302
I didn't mind.

241
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,930
I would listen to the house breathing.

242
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,183
All those people sleeping.

243
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,854
I felt safe.

244
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,294
It was a place of great routine.

245
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,297
Every morning at 5:30,
no matter the weather,

246
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:01,509
General Winslow, U. S. Army, Retired,
would raise the flag.

247
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:08,308
Mrs. Sybil Wagner,
once an opera singer of some note,

248
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,061
well, she sang Wagner.

249
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,282
All right, baby, come on.

250
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:28,244
We got to put some life
into these old sticks for you.

251
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:32,666
Get you walking so you can help me out
around here. Come on now, hear?

252
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,587
No matter the season,
supper was served promptly at 5:30.

253
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:44,010
Molasses.

254
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,514
I learned to read when I was five.

255
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,977
My grandfather was a dresser
for a famous actor.

256
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,813
He brung home every play
for me to read.

257
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,777
"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,

258
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:05,323
"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.

259
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,827
"Even like a man
new haled from the rack,

260
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,621
"So fare my limbs
with long imprisonment.

261
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:16,001
"And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death,

262
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,587
"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer."

263
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,553
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

264
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:30,306
The actor my grandfather worked for
was John Wilkes Booth.

265
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,644
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

266
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,065
You never know what's coming for you.

267
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:43,361
On Saturday nights,
Mama would make me go to church.

268
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,533
Benjamin!

269
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,212
-Amen! Amen!
-Amen! Amen!

270
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,383
What can I do for you, sister?

271
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:20,690
Her parts are all twisted up inside
and she can't have little children.

272
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:28,531
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

273
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,742
so she can bear the fruit of the womb.

274
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,244
Out, damnable affliction!

275
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,497
-Praise God!
-Praise God!

276
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,748
Hallelujah!

277
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,333
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

278
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,171
And what's this old man's irrediction?

279
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,257
He's got the Devil on his back,

280
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,677
trying to ride him into the grave
before his time.

281
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,390
-Out, Zebuchar!
-Yes!

282
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,351
-Out, Beelzebub!
-Yes!

283
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,938
How old are you?

284
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,565
Seven. But I look a lot older.

285
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,151
God bless you.

286
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,195
He's seven.

287
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,952
Now, this is a man
with optimism in his heart.

288
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,745
-All right.
-Belief in his soul!

289
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,830
-Yes!
-Yes!

290
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,748
We are all children in the eyes of God!

291
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,125
-Yes!
-Hallelujah!

292
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,128
We are gonna get you out of that chair.

293
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,255
-And we're gonna have you walk.
-Amen.

294
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,715
It’s all right.

295
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,844
In the name of God's glory. . .

296
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,138
Rise up!

297
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,015
Come on.

298
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,602
Come on. Walk.

299
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,146
Come on, son. Come on.

300
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,982
-Come on with it, son. Come on.
-Come on.

301
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,443
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

302
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:52,323
He's gonna see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a cane.

303
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,242
He's gonna see that you walk
from faith. . .

304
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,328
-Hallelujah!
-. . .and divine inspiration alone!

305
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,580
-Yes.
-Hey, Ben!

306
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,998
-Go, son!
-Now walk.

307
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,332
-Yes.
-Come on.

308
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,086
Don't touch him.

309
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,215
Rise up, old man.

310
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,844
Rise up like Lazarus.

311
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,096
I said, rise up!

312
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,098
Hallelujah!

313
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,476
Yes.

314
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,145
Come on.

315
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,229
Say hallelujah.

316
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,731
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

317
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,650
Walk.

318
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,528
Walk on. Yes.

319
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,408
That's right, Benjamin.

320
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,745
Now when I look back on it,
it was miraculous.

321
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,916
But you know the saying, the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away.

322
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,043
Glory in the highest!

323
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,298
Sweet Jesus!

324
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,549
-No!
-No!

325
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,345
There were so many birthdays.

326
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,973
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow...

327
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,684
So we wouldn't run out,
we would spare the candles.

328
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:05,813
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays
and I don't like cake.

329
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,485
And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.

330
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,697
You always knew
when someone left us.

331
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,325
There was a silence in the house.

332
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,633
It was a wonderful place to grow up.

333
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:38,221
I was with people who had shed
ail the inconsequences of earlier life.

334
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:43,017
Left wondering about the weather,
the temperature of a bath,

335
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,479
the light at the end of a day.

336
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,862
For everyone that died, someone would
come to take their place.

337
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,199
I’ve been married five times.

338
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:02,412
My fifth wife and I are captured
by a neighbor tribe of cannibals.

339
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,579
Oh, goodness gracious.

340
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,123
We escaped across the river.

341
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,626
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

342
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:09,919
Oh, my God.

343
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,880
My second wife steps on cobra
and dies.

344
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,175
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

345
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,304
That's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

346
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,514
-The next summer I’m captured. . .
-He's a Pygmy.

347
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,474
. . .with three others
by the Baschiele tribe.

348
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:28,479
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer
to a very strange American man.

349
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,084
I hear you're not so old
as you're looking.

350
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,420
You just fooling everybody.

351
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,007
What's the matter?
Did you get Madjembe?

352
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,508
What's Madjembe?

353
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:58,926
Worms.

354
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,596
I don't think I have worms.

355
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,765
This is just how I am.

356
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,726
-Did you take your pills today?
-No, ma'am.

357
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,187
Come. Let's get a cold root beer.

358
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,397
I found the medication
under your pillow.

359
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:14,692
I’m not supposed to. It’s dangerous.

360
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:17,528
Who said that? Come on, little man.

361
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,490
Hello, children.

362
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,252
Hold, please.

363
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:40,218
Then I’m in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

364
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:44,639
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

365
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:46,974
Look.

366
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,645
What's it like living in a cage?

367
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,230
It stinks.

368
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,149
But the monkeys.

369
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,985
They do some tricks there.

370
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,905
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali.

371
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,491
She is orangutan.

372
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,412
When I’m not playing with the monkeys,
they want me to run to the bars

373
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,664
in my cage, with my teeth.

374
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,634
So then what'd you do?

375
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:27,598
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there.
Wandered most of the time.

376
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,100
You were all alone?

377
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,477
Plenty of time you’ll be alone.

378
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:35,022
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

379
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,902
But I’ll tell you a little secret.

380
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:43,281
Fat people, skinny people, tall people,

381
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,409
white people,
they're just as alone as we are.

382
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,162
But they're scared shitless.

383
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,004
I think about the river I grew up on.

384
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,382
It would be nice to sit by my river again.

385
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:06,012
Come, I have an appointment.

386
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,975
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

387
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,394
Always ready. Always ready.

388
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,315
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

389
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,402
-It’s a pleasure to meet you, sir.
-My pleasure, ma'am.

390
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,488
You can find your own way home,
can't you?

391
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,324
Take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.

392
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,915
Hey! Hey!

393
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:57,772
Where in God's name have you been?
Get in here.

394
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:02,527
I mean, you take my breath away,
you know that?

395
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,530
Oh, Lord, I was so worried about you.

396
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,786
It had been the best day of my life.

397
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,414
-How's her breathing?
-It’s shallow.

398
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,041
They say it’ll reach us in a few hours,

399
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,044
so I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

400
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,630
They say there's nothing to worry about
here in the hospital.

401
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,216
Nurses'll be right here if you need them.
Are you okay?

402
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,095
-Yeah, I’m okay reading.
-I shouldn't be more than an hour.

403
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:33,140
Was there just company?

404
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,102
It was just Dorothy leaving.

405
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,689
Go on, Caroline.

406
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,900
"On Sundays, the families would come
and visit."

407
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:46,237
It was Thanksgiving, 1 930.

408
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,323
I met the person
who changed my life forever.

409
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,462
Well, Benjamin.

410
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,174
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

411
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,218
Good day, Mrs. Fuller.

412
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:12,597
A single cane,
back straight as an arrow.

413
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,057
What elixir have you been drinking?

414
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:18,519
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Grandma! Look at me!

415
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,274
That was really something.

416
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,276
Come on over here, you.

417
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,195
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy.

418
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,990
This is Mr. . .

419
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,785
I’m afraid, Benjamin,
I don't rightly know your last name.

420
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,537
Benjamin's fine.

421
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,498
I never forgot her blue eyes.

422
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,585
Good people, supper is served.

423
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:48,799
Health and food, for love and friends.
For everything thy goodness sends.

424
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,384
Amen.

425
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,719
-Amen!
-Amen!

426
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,975
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds?

427
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,143
Why do you say that?

428
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,355
They're in the pheasant family,
can't hardly fly.

429
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,982
It’s sad, don't you think?
Birds that can't fly?

430
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,276
I love birds that can't fly.

431
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,403
They are so delicious.

432
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,990
-That's terrible.
-I have something to telic y'all

433
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:16,285
while we're giving thanks
for God's blessings.

434
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,329
I had a miracle happen.

435
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,457
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.

436
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,463
What does she mean,
answered her prayers?

437
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,090
Thanks. Thank you.

438
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,592
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

439
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,513
That's what my mama said
when I was gonna have a baby brother,

440
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,932
but he didn't live long,

441
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,477
'cause he didn't breathe right.

442
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:48,359
"In the afternoon, when he had got
his beautiful hind legs

443
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:52,071
"just as Big God Nqong had promised.

444
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,116
"You can see that it is 5:00,

445
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,203
"because Big God Nqong's
clock says so."

446
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,122
Isn't that something?

447
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,040
Again, read it again.

448
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,459
Oh, read it again, please.

449
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,879
All right.
But afterwards, you must go to bed.

450
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,631
I promise.

451
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,468
"Old Man Kangaroo."

452
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,433
Are you sleeping?

453
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,436
Who's that?

454
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,146
It’s me, Daisy.

455
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,648
Oh, hi!

456
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,734
'Kay, come on.

457
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,621
Where are we going?

458
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,584
Come on. Under here.

459
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,553
Here, you light it.

460
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,764
I’m not supposed to play with matches.

461
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,141
Don't be a chicken. Light it.

462
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:16,155
I’ll telic you a secret if you’ll telic me one.

463
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,698
Okay.

464
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:21,160
I saw my mama kissing another man.

465
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,621
Her face was red from it.

466
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,374
Your turn.

467
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,963
I’m not as old as I look.

468
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,673
I thought so.

469
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,053
You don't seem like an old person.

470
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,889
-Like my grandma.
-I’m not.

471
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,267
Are you sick?

472
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,979
Well, I heard Mama
and Tizzy whispering.

473
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:53,275
They said I was gonna die soon,
but maybe not.

474
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,071
You're odd.

475
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,699
You're different
than anybody I’ve ever met.

476
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,038
-May l?
-Okay.

477
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,673
What are you doing under there?

478
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:19,218
You come right out here
and get back up to bed!

479
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,095
It’s after midnight!

480
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,305
You are not to be playing together.

481
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,932
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,184
Now you get back to bed, little lady.

483
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:31,272
You're too young to be wandering
around in the night on your own.

484
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:37,778
And you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

485
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,129
You are a different child.

486
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,006
A man-child.

487
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:01,594
And, baby, people aren't gonna
understand just how different you are.

488
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,060
What's wrong with me, Mama?

489
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,771
Come here.

490
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,151
God hasn't said yet, baby.

491
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,117
Now go on to bed, hear?
And behave yourself.

492
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,996
Go on. Say your prayers, hear?

493
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,887
Did I ever telic you I’ve been struck
by lightning seven times?

494
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:50,142
Once when I was repairing
a leak on the roof.

495
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,483
Once I was just crossing
the road to get the mail.

496
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,792
I never forgot her...

497
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,418
". . . blue eyes."

498
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,463
Mom?

499
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:24,343
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you
from the first time that he saw you?

500
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,055
Not many people experience that.

501
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,308
Want me to go on?

502
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,312
He crosses something out.

503
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:38,691
When that baby came,
things were different.

504
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:42,152
Your mama gone away
And your daddy gonna stay

505
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:46,073
Didn't leave nobody but the baby

506
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,119
Babies were born, people died.

507
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,872
A lot of folks been through
that old house.

508
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:59,044
I’ve come to say goodbye.
I’m going away.

509
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,421
Going?

510
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,464
Where?

511
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,133
I haven't figured that out yet,

512
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,677
but I’ll send you a postcard
when I get there.

513
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,555
What about your friend, the tall lady?

514
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,056
We are not friends anymore.

515
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:14,435
That's what happens
with tall people sometimes.

516
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,312
Well, goodbye.

517
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,376
Spent a lot of time by myself that year.

518
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:41,962
Hello?

519
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,507
-Hi.
-I’m moving in today.

520
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:48,427
Welcome. We've been expecting you.

521
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,555
Can you please show her up
to Mrs. Rousseau's old room?

522
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,017
I’m sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

523
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,103
Well, she's old as the hills.
She's almost blind.

524
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:01,148
She won't be a bother much longer.

525
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,943
Well, all right,
long as she stays from up underfoot.

526
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,236
Right this way, ma'am.

527
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,490
As hard as I try,
I can't remember her name.

528
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,743
Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford.

529
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,537
Maybe it was Maple.

530
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,956
It’s funny how sometimes
the people we remember the least

531
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,626
make the greatest impression on us.

532
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,545
I do remember she wore diamonds.

533
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,424
And she always dressed in fine
clothing, as if she was going out.

534
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:31,136
Although she never did
and nobody ever came to visit her.

535
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,182
She taught me to play the piano.

536
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:43,190
It’s not about how well you play.

537
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,777
It’s how you feel
about what you're playing.

538
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,195
Try this.

539
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:07,798
You can't help putting yourself
in the music.

540
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,850
There were many changes.

541
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:21,061
Some you could see,
some you couldn't.

542
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:25,023
Hair had started growing
in all sorts of places,

543
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,526
along with other things.

544
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,572
I felt pretty good, considering.

545
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,284
Darling, the pain.

546
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,911
All right, Mom, I’ll get the nurse.

547
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,208
Look at this eye.
This is a major hurricane,

548
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,211
a slow hurricane,
with maximum sustained winds of...

549
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,172
Not doing too good?

550
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,301
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

551
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,678
I’m gonna ride it out.

552
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,681
There.
That should make things much easier.

553
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:04,313
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

554
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:07,900
My father waited four hours for
my brother to get here from Boger City.

555
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,985
Couldn't go without him.

556
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,197
-She seems like a sweet woman.
-Yeah.

557
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,532
I haven't had as much time with her
as I would've. . .

558
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:17,534
-You busy? I could use your help.
-Excuse me.

559
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:18,911
Sure.

560
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,097
"Queenie would let me go
with Mr. Daws. . ."

561
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:43,018
...to Poverty Point to watch the boats
go up and down the river.

562
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,062
These were hard times.

563
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,818
Did I ever telic you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

564
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:56,156
Once when I was in the field,
just tending to my cows.

565
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:04,957
My fourth hand didn't show up.

566
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,671
Anybody want to make $2
for a day's work 'round here?

567
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,258
What's the matter?

568
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,135
Nobody wants to do an honest
day's work for an honest day's pay?

569
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,804
He never pays.

570
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,557
-Nobody wants a job?
-I do.

571
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,020
You got your sea legs about you,
old man?

572
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,523
I think.

573
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,904
Well, that's good enough for me.

574
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:39,491
Get your ass on board.
We’ll sure as hell find out.

575
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,623
I was as happy as I could be.

576
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:47,958
I need a volunteer!

577
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,418
I would do anything.

578
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,961
Yes, Captain!

579
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,380
Scrape off all this bird shit!

580
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,799
Right away, sir.

581
00:43:56,592 --> 00:44:01,096
And I was actually gonna be paid
for something I would've done for free.

582
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:05,100
His name was Captain Mike Clark.

583
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,021
He'd been on a tugboat
since he was seven.

584
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:11,773
Get moving, then.

585
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,234
Come here.

586
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,406
Can you still get it up?

587
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,743
I do every morning.

588
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:26,830
The old pole, huh? The high, hard one?

589
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,749
I guess.

590
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:34,004
When was the last time
you had a woman?

591
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,425
-Never.
-Never?

592
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,011
Not that I know of, sir.

593
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:43,263
Wait a minute, now.

594
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:48,185
You mean to say you've been
on this earth however many years

595
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,605
and you've never had a woman?

596
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,321
Damn, that's the saddest thing
I’ve ever heard in my life.

597
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,032
Never?

598
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:03,909
No.

599
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:10,624
Well, then, by Jesus,
you are coming with me.

600
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,220
What did your father do?

601
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,389
I never met my father.

602
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,432
You lucky bastard.

603
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,977
All fathers want to do is hold you down.

604
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,983
Out on my father's boat,
workin' the two-a-day,

605
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:39,736
this little, fat bastard.

606
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:41,571
"Tug Irish," they called him.

607
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:45,033
Anyway, I finally work up the nerve
and telic him,

608
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,621
"I don't want to spend the rest of my life
on a goddamn tugboat."

609
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,706
You know what I’m saying?

610
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,751
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life on a tugboat.

611
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:57,170
Absolutely! Damn right!

612
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,551
So you know
what my father says to me?

613
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:07,806
He says,
"Who the hell do you think you are?

614
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,684
"What the hell do you think you can do?"

615
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,644
So I telic him.

616
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:16,481
"Well, if you're asking,

617
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,777
"I want to be an artist."

618
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,238
He laughs.

619
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:28,743
"An artist? God meant for you
to work a tugboat, just like me.

620
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,455
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do."

621
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,833
Well, I turned myself into an artist.

622
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,045
A tattoo artist!

623
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:44,259
I put on every one of these myself.

624
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:50,599
You have to skin me alive
to take my art away from me now.

625
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:54,895
When I’m dead,
I’m gonna send him my arm.

626
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,564
That one.

627
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:02,527
Don't let anyone telic you different.

628
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:05,238
You gotta do what you're meant to do.

629
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,450
And I happen to be a goddamned artist.

630
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:11,369
But you're a tugboat captain.

631
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:13,663
Captain Mike?

632
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:16,541
We're ready for you and your friend.

633
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,296
Let's go, old timer, eh?
Break your cherry.

634
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:25,217
-Hello, my lovelies!
-Hey, Captain.

635
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,301
-Hi, Captain.
-Hi.

636
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:29,554
-Hi.
-Hi.

637
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:32,724
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

638
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,937
How are you tonight, grandpa?

639
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,731
It was a night to remember.

640
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:49,115
What are you, Dick Tracy or something?
I’ve got to rest.

641
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:51,493
Again.

642
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,121
-Thank you.
-No, thank you. You have a nice night.

643
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,374
-Will you be here tomorrow?
-Every night but Sunday.

644
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:01,169
It sure made me understand
the value of earning a living.

645
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,630
Good night, sweetie. Come back now.

646
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,966
Things money can buy you.

647
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,318
It’s nasty out.

648
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,655
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

649
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,701
Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir.

650
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:44,504
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

651
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,299
-I’m Benjamin.
-Benjamin.

652
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,677
It’s a pleasure to know you.

653
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,432
Would you like to stop somewhere
and have a drink?

654
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,933
All right.

655
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,520
Evening, Mr. Button.

656
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,027
What’ll it be, sir?

657
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:10,780
-I’ll have whatever he's having.
-Sazerac for the both of us.

658
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,241
With whiskey, not brandy.

659
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:14,826
You don't drink, do you?

660
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,537
-It’s a night for firsts.
-How's that?

661
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,706
I’ve never been to a brothel, either.

662
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,584
Well, it's an experience.

663
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,795
It certainly is.
There's a time for everything.

664
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,340
-True enough.
-Your drinks.

665
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:35,221
I don't mean to be rude, but your hands.
Is that painful?

666
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,141
Well, I was born
with some form of disease.

667
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,809
What kind of disease?

668
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,686
I was born old.

669
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,898
-I’m sorry.
-No need to be.

670
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,567
There's nothing wrong with old age.

671
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,454
My wife passed away many years ago.

672
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,707
I’m so, so sorry.

673
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,044
She died in childbirth.

674
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,092
-To children.
-To mothers.

675
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:19,182
What line of work you in, Mr. Button?

676
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:23,436
Buttons. Button's Buttons.
There isn't a button that we don't make.

677
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,982
Our biggest competition
is B. F. Goodrich

678
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,818
and his infernal zippers.

679
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:32,696
Would you gentlemen like
anything else?

680
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,864
One for the road, Benjamin?

681
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,784
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.

682
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,538
So, what line of work do you do?

683
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,417
I’m a tugboat man.

684
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,633
I enjoyed talking to you.

685
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,261
I enjoyed drinking with you.

686
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,224
Benjamin?

687
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,769
Would you mind if, time to time,
I stopped by and said hello?

688
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:08,314
Anytime. Good night, Mr. Button.

689
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,608
Good night, Benjamin.

690
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,694
Drive on.

691
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,701
Where have you been?

692
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:24,831
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to some music.

693
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,794
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

694
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,882
Growing up's a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.

695
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,179
One person is there, then suddenly
somebody else has taken her place.

696
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,431
She wasn't all elbows
and knees anymore.

697
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,224
Benjamin! Come on!

698
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,976
Okay.

699
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:47,771
I loved those weekends
when she'd come

700
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:50,690
and spend the night
with her grandmother.

701
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,242
Daisy. Daisy.

702
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,579
You want to see something?

703
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:10,543
You gotta keep it a secret,
so get dressed. I’ll meet you out back.

704
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,425
Come on.

705
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,347
-Can you swim?
-I can do anything you can do.

706
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,058
Here, put this on. We gotta hurry.

707
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,531
Is he okay?

708
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,074
Captain?

709
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,244
Captain Mike?

710
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:50,667
Morning, Captain. Can you take us out?

711
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:54,128
Do you know what day it is?

712
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,505
Sunday?

713
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,757
Do you know what that means?

714
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,469
Means I was very drunk last night.

715
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:04,347
Well, you're drunk every night.

716
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,102
-Is that a girl?
-Close friend.

717
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:10,895
I want to show her the river.

718
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,315
You're not supposed to go joyriding
with civilians.

719
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,610
I could lose my license.

720
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:28,913
What are you waiting for?

721
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,196
Pulled in for repair a wounded duck.

722
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:05,783
She's flying now, huh?

723
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:07,952
Ahoy, sailor!

724
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,834
I wish we could go with them.

725
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,134
Did you say something, Mom?

726
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,852
It’s getting really bad.

727
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,689
Can you hear me, Mom?

728
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,986
Time just seeped out of me.

729
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,536
"Things were changing quickly."

730
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:54,749
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

731
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:59,253
What if I told you
that I wasn't getting older,

732
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:02,632
but I was getting younger
than everybody else?

733
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:06,636
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,

734
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,597
to have to see everybody you love
die before you do.

735
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:11,599
It’s an awful responsibility.

736
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:15,269
I’d never thought about life or death
that way before.

737
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:20,984
Benjamin, we're meant
to lose the people we love.

738
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:24,821
How else would we know
how important they are to us?

739
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:32,412
And one fall day, a familiar visitor
came knocking on our door.

740
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,916
You want to go with me
to the drugstore?

741
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,429
She taught me how to play the piano.

742
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:50,805
-Amen.
-Amen.

743
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,100
And she taught me
what it meant to miss somebody.

744
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,106
Let's go.

745
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,026
I had gone to a brothel.

746
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,445
I’d had my first drink.

747
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:09,032
Said goodbye to one friend
and buried another.

748
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:14,412
In 1 936, when I was coming to the end
of the 1 7th year of my life,

749
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,373
I packed my bag, said goodbye.

750
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,792
-Bye, Benjamin.
-Goodbye.

751
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:24,380
I knew, life being what it was,
I’d probably never see them again.

752
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,217
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.

753
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,803
-Good luck to you, son.
-Thank you.

754
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,227
-I love you, Mama.
-I love you, too, baby.

755
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,648
I want you to say your prayers
every night, hear?

756
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:49,572
Be safe, hear?

757
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,335
Benjamin!

758
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,091
-Where you going?
-To sea.

759
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,552
I’ll send you a postcard.

760
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,306
From everywhere.

761
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,017
Write me a postcard from everywhere.

762
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,408
Can you imagine?

763
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:42,917
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

764
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,462
Every place he worked.

765
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,883
Newfoundland. Baffin Bay.

766
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,554
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.

767
00:57:55,305 --> 00:58:00,059
He had gone with that Captain Mike.

768
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,313
Captain Mike had contracted
for three years

769
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,732
with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage.

770
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:10,695
The old ship had been refitted with
a diesel engine and a new sea winch.

771
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:13,698
We went around Florida
and up the Atlantic seaboard.

772
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:17,201
We were a crew of seven now.
Captain Mike and me.

773
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:20,663
Cookie, Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware.

774
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,166
The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,

775
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,501
who got along fine at sea
but, for some reason,

776
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:28,671
once they were on dry land
couldn't stand the sight of each other.

777
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:32,341
You know, one in every
eight boats never returns.

778
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,552
There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name.

779
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,512
All hands lost at sea.

780
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:38,848
From Belvedere, South Dakota.

781
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,060
And Pleasant Curtis
from Asheville, Notch.

782
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:46,355
Never said a word to anyone,
except himself.

783
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:51,360
I wrote him constantly.

784
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:57,992
I told him I had been invited to
audition in New York City

785
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,204
for the School of American Ballet.

786
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:02,705
Please stay.

787
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,957
Thank you. Thank you.

788
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:08,211
You can stay.

789
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,799
But I was relegated to the corps.

790
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,469
Another dancing gypsy.

791
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:22,308
Benjamin!

792
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:25,394
How is it when you showed up

793
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:29,398
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave,

794
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:33,694
but now, either I drink a hell
of a lot more than I think I do,

795
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:36,614
or you sprouted?

796
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,283
What's your secret?

797
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:42,286
Well, Captain,

798
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,873
you do drink a lot.

799
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:54,924
We stayed in a small hotel
with a grand name, The Winter Palace.

800
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,802
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

801
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:01,389
The hummingbird
is not just another bird.

802
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,851
Its heart rate's 1 ,200 beats per minute.

803
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,314
Its wings beat 80 times a second.

804
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:15,236
lf you was to stop their wings
from beating,

805
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,698
it would be dead
in less than 1 0 seconds.

806
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,368
This is no ordinary bird.

807
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,162
This is a frickin' miracle.

808
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:32,211
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

809
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,089
and you know what they saw?

810
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:38,384
Their wingtips are doing that.

811
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:46,267
You know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for?

812
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,813
Infinity.

813
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,231
Infinity!

814
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:58,654
Everybody, no matter
what differences they had,

815
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:02,783
the languages, the color of their skin,
had one thing in common.

816
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:06,078
They were drunk every single night.

817
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,705
Three, please.

818
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,415
Could you hold, dear, for us, please?

819
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,792
Thank you very much. Good evening.

820
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:14,587
Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.

821
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:18,007
She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.

822
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,926
But she was pretty as any picture to me.

823
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,263
What are you looking at?

824
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:29,018
lf you must know,
we have a longstanding agreement

825
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,478
never to go to bed sober.

826
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,980
-Isn't that right, darling?
-Whatever you say, darling.

827
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,149
Her husband was Walter Abbott.

828
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:39,153
He was Chief Minister of
the British Trade Mission in Murmansk,

829
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,863
and he was a spy.

830
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,866
-Darling.
-Oh, thank you, my darling.

831
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,993
-Key, darling.
-Oh, yes.

832
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:53,542
I broke my heel off one of my shoes.

833
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:57,254
I’m not in the habit of walking about
in my stocking feet.

834
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,803
They were long days there.

835
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,312
And even longer nights.

836
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:19,068
One particular night,
I was having trouble sleeping.

837
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,029
I’m sorry.

838
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,658
I couldn't sleep.

839
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:42,007
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

840
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,760
Oh, no. Thank you.

841
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,175
Milk? Honey?

842
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,719
A bit of honey, please.

843
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,013
I hope you like flies in your honey.

844
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,806
Oh, perhaps not.

845
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:49,909
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little.

846
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,077
Steep?

847
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:53,537
Soak.

848
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:57,458
I don't know, I mean,
there's a proper way of making tea.

849
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,794
Well, where I’m from,
people just want it to be hot.

850
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:03,005
Well, quite right.

851
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,308
-Now, you're a seaman.
-A sailor.

852
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,144
I hope you won't think me impolite,
but I have to ask,

853
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:19,355
aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

854
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:22,900
There's no age limit,
as long as you can do the work.

855
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:35,996
And you have trouble sleeping?
Thank you.

856
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:39,291
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

857
01:04:40,252 --> 01:04:42,711
Something's been keeping me up.

858
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,130
My father, in his 80s,

859
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,509
he was so convinced
he was gonna die in his sleep,

860
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:52,304
he limited himself
to having afternoon naps.

861
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,808
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

862
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:58,852
-Did he?
-Did he what?

863
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:00,646
Die in his sleep?

864
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,900
He died sitting in his favorite chair

865
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:07,653
listening to his favorite program
on the wireless.

866
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,239
He must have known something.

867
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:21,041
My husband's the British Trade Minister,
and we've been here for 1 4 months.

868
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:24,461
-Good God.
-We were supposed to go to Peking

869
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:28,048
but it never seemed to work out.

870
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,218
Have you been in the Far East?

871
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:33,512
No. I’ve never been anywhere, really.

872
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:36,056
I mean, outside of harbors.

873
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:37,808
And where is it that you're from?

874
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,436
New Orleans. Louisiana.

875
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:44,231
I didn't know there was another.

876
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:51,572
And she told me about all the places
she had been, and what she had seen.

877
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:56,076
And we talked till just before the dawn.

878
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,579
I’m just a lush, myself.

879
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:03,626
And we went back to our rooms,
to our separate lives.

880
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:12,384
But every night,
we'd meet again in that lobby.

881
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:21,602
A hotel in the middle of the night
can be a magical place.

882
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:27,399
A mouse running, and stopping.

883
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:30,903
A radiator hissing.

884
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:33,781
A curtain blowing.

885
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:40,913
There's something peaceful,
even comforting

886
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,249
knowing that the people you love
are asleep in their beds

887
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,585
where nothing can harm them.

888
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,633
Elizabeth and I would lose track
of the night

889
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,344
until just before daybreak.

890
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,724
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

891
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:02,351
Beg pardon?

892
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:06,271
Well, married women don't customarily
sit around

893
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,399
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

894
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:12,069
I wouldn't know what a married woman
does or doesn't do.

895
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,284
Good night.

896
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,913
Murmansk.

897
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,585
"I’ve met somebody,
and I’ve fallen in love."

898
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,920
Mom?

899
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:36,301
That was over 60 years ago.

900
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,595
Did you love him, Mother?

901
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,473
What does a girl know about love?

902
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:16,300
Well. . .

903
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:22,556
-I’m not dressed.
-Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.

904
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:27,895
Don't waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,

905
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:31,023
'cause they're really
completely ordinary,

906
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:36,111
but the caviar and the vodka

907
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:40,783
are sublime and plentiful.

908
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,871
So.

909
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,461
Savor it.

910
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,548
And don't eat it all at once,

911
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,760
because that way,
there's nothing left to enjoy.

912
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:05,766
And now, take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

913
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:23,492
You haven't been with many women,
have you?

914
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,328
Not on Sundays.

915
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,249
And you've never had caviar before,
have you?

916
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,000
No, ma'am.

917
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,508
When I was 1 9,

918
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:46,765
I attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the English Channel.

919
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,184
Really?

920
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,855
But the current that day
was so strong that,

921
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:56,066
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

922
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,278
I was in the water for 32 hours.

923
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:04,074
And when I was two miles from Calais,

924
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,952
it started to rain.

925
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,580
That's it! Steady on!

926
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,749
When I couldn't go any further,

927
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:15,794
I stopped.

928
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,797
I just stopped.

929
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:24,261
And everybody asked me,
would I try again?

930
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:26,847
For why wouldn't l?

931
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,476
But I never did.

932
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:37,149
As a matter of fact, I’ve never done
anything with my life after that.

933
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,322
Your hands are so coarse.

934
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:56,209
I can feel the wind in your cheek.

935
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,510
I’m afraid it's the witching hour.

936
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:14,645
It was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me.

937
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,606
It’s something you never forget.

938
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:30,118
I think you make me feel younger.

939
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,788
You make me feel years younger, too.

940
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:34,498
I wish I was.

941
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,626
So many things I’d change.

942
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,629
I’d undo all my mistakes.

943
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,464
What mistakes?

944
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,970
I kept waiting, you know?

945
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:53,100
Thinking that I’d do something
to change my circumstances.

946
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,103
Do something.

947
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:00,899
Such an awful waste.
You never get it back.

948
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:02,859
Wasted time.

949
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:11,576
lf we're going to have an affair,

950
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:15,122
you're never to look at me
during the day.

951
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,709
And we're always to part before sunrise.

952
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,004
And we will never say "I love you."

953
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,424
Those are the rules.

954
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:30,178
-Are you cold?
-I’m freezing.

955
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,222
Oh, you! You're frozen.

956
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:35,559
What an idiot, I’m standing here
in this fur. How thoughtless of me.

957
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:12,012
She was the first woman
that ever loved me.

958
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:16,224
You want me to skip some?

959
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:22,105
No, I’m glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

960
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,236
"I couldn't wait to see her again."

961
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,460
We saw each other every night.

962
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,338
We always used the same room.

963
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:51,676
But each time seemed new
and different.

964
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,513
Come here.

965
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:03,355
Elizabeth.

966
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,149
Good night.

967
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:10,487
Until one night.

968
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:53,321
Yesterday, December 7th, 1 941 ,

969
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:56,533
a date which will live in infamy...

970
01:14:56,617 --> 01:15:00,787
It’s a meeting, a policy meeting
regarding your future,

971
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:03,290
possibly beyond.

972
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,252
There's been a change of plan, lads.

973
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,046
As you may or may not know,

974
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:12,757
the Japs bombed
Pearl Harbor yesterday.

975
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:16,678
Frank D. Roosevelt’s asked
each of us to do our part.

976
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:21,266
The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.

977
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,978
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue.

978
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,859
Anybody doesn't want to go to war,
now is the time to say so.

979
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:35,155
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

980
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,411
Yeah, I’ve been meaning
to talk with you, Mike.

981
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,538
My wife's doing poorly.

982
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:46,374
I’d like to maybe see her one more time.

983
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:51,922
You're free to make your way home
any way you can, Mr. Mayes.

984
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,304
Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook?

985
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:03,475
Food poisoning's one of the leading
causes of death at sea.

986
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,936
Right after
inadequate safety equipment.

987
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,688
I can cook, Captain.
Been doing it all my life.

988
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:13,193
I don't know.
You're a little moody for war, Benjamin.

989
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,237
What the hell?

990
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:19,699
I’ll take any man wants to kick the shite
out of the Japs and the Huns.

991
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:24,871
That's it, pack your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

992
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,505
She had left a note.

993
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,634
She wrote,
"It was nice to have met you."

994
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:40,011
And that was it.

995
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:46,268
It wasn't the war any of us expected.

996
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:50,021
We would just tow crippled ships,
scraps of metal, really.

997
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,608
lf there was a war, we didn't see it.

998
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:59,572
There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.

999
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:01,866
But most of all, he loved America.

1000
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:04,869
There is no other country in the world.

1001
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:06,079
When you spell America. . .

1002
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:10,333
His name was Dennis Smith,
and he was a full-blooded Cherokee.

1003
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:13,545
His family had been Americans
for over 500 years.

1004
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:18,174
These pacifists.
They say they won't fight on conscience.

1005
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:21,886
Now, where would be
if everybody decided to act

1006
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:25,974
-according to their conscience?
-Keep it down, would you, Chief?

1007
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,702
Hey. I’ve been watching you.

1008
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:48,538
You seem trustworthy.

1009
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:52,417
lf something happens to me,

1010
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:59,049
could you see that this gets to my wife?

1011
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:03,720
He'd given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.

1012
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:08,892
I want my family to know
I was thinking about them.

1013
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,482
All hands on deck!

1014
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,779
Get your asses up here,
you lazy bastards!

1015
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:44,302
The war had finally found us.

1016
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,473
All stop!

1017
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:53,186
Pleasant, man that light.

1018
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:05,240
A transport carrying 1 ,300 men
had been split by a torpedo.

1019
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:09,911
We were first to arrive at the scene.

1020
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:13,581
-Cut the engines!
-All stop!

1021
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:20,630
We were the only sound.

1022
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,979
Fellas!

1023
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:47,031
Sub!

1024
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,622
We sure as hell
can't outrun them fuckers.

1025
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,668
Battle stations!

1026
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:09,554
Thank you, Chief.

1027
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:12,932
What?

1028
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:27,739
Is that the last one?

1029
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,572
Captain!

1030
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,840
They shot the hell out of my painting!

1031
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:11,968
Give me your other hand.

1032
01:22:17,308 --> 01:22:18,349
You’ll be all right, Captain.

1033
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:22,729
They got a nice spot in Heaven
waiting for you. Nice spot.

1034
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:27,317
You can be as mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1035
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,990
You could swear, curse the Fates.

1036
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:38,411
But when it comes to the end,

1037
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:42,373
you have to let go.

1038
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,590
Captain?

1039
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:14,739
Thirteen hundred and twenty eight men
died that day.

1040
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:20,286
I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee,
Dennis Smith.

1041
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,457
John Grimm, who was right,
he was gonna die there.

1042
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:28,670
I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money.

1043
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:32,548
I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody,

1044
01:23:32,633 --> 01:23:37,345
and to Mike Clark,
captain of the tugboat Chelsea.

1045
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:44,268
I said goodbye to all the other men
who had dreams of their own,

1046
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,938
ail the men
who wanted to be insurance salesmen

1047
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:49,982
or doctors or lawyers or lndian chiefs.

1048
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,860
This don't get fixed.

1049
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:58,032
Out here, death didn't seem natural.

1050
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:18,219
I’d never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea.

1051
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:21,347
Before or since.

1052
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:33,443
And in May of 1 945,
when I was 26 years old,

1053
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:34,652
I came home.

1054
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:38,197
I’m ready! I’m ready!

1055
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:39,657
I’m coming!

1056
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:44,203
-I’m ready!
-All right, I’m coming, Miss Alfalina.

1057
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:45,830
-Queenie?
-Yes?

1058
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:57,592
Sweet Jesus! Oh, you're home!
Oh, Lord, you came back!

1059
01:24:58,469 --> 01:25:00,428
-Let me look at you.
-Who's that, Mama?

1060
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,765
-Child, it's your brother, Benjamin.
-I didn't know he was my brother.

1061
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,558
There's a shitload of things
you don't know, child.

1062
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:06,809
Get on out there and finish sweeping.

1063
01:25:06,894 --> 01:25:09,103
Come here, wash your hands,
help me with the table. Go on, now.

1064
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:13,107
Turn around.
You look like you've been born again.

1065
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:15,443
Younger than the springtime.

1066
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:19,197
I think that preacher laid hands on you
gave you a second life.

1067
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:22,950
I knew it that moment I saw you,
you were special.

1068
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:24,911
I telic you what, my knees are sore,

1069
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:27,538
'cause I’ve been on them every night
asking the Lord,

1070
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:31,375
I said,
"God, just bring him home safely."

1071
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,961
Remember what I told you?

1072
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:35,713
"You never know
what's coming for you?"

1073
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:37,715
That's right. Sit down.

1074
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:43,221
Well, you learn anything
worth repeating?

1075
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:49,560
-I sure saw some things.
-Oh, you seen some pain.

1076
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:53,815
-Some joy, too?
-Sure. Sure, I did.

1077
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:58,069
Yeah, that's what I want to hear.
Look at you.

1078
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,697
-Where's Tizzy?
-Oh, baby.

1079
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:07,995
Mr. Weathers died in his sleep
one night last April.

1080
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,582
-Mama, I’m so sorry.
-Don't you worry about that, baby.

1081
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:15,962
Yeah, well, it's only
one or two of them left now.

1082
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:17,505
They all just about new.

1083
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:21,509
Guess they're waiting their turn
like everybody else, huh?

1084
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,345
I’m so glad you're back home with me!

1085
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:27,598
Now, we're gonna have to find you
a wife and a new job! That's right.

1086
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,600
Come on in here,
help me with this table.

1087
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:34,355
Benjamin.

1088
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:37,567
You're wasting your time, baby.
She's stone deaf.

1089
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:41,696
Oh, and you’ll be staying in
what was Mrs. DeSeroux's old room.

1090
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,740
You're too big to be rooming
with anybody else.

1091
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:51,455
It’s a funny thing about coming home.

1092
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:55,918
Looks the same,
smells the same, feels the same.

1093
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,466
Did I ever telic you I’ve been struck
by lightning seven times?

1094
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:07,513
Once when I was sitting in my truck,
just minding my own business.

1095
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:16,814
You realize what's changed is you.

1096
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:23,529
And late one morning,
not long after I’d been back...

1097
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:25,281
Thank you.

1098
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:48,429
Hey.

1099
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:56,854
-Excuse me, is Queenie here?
-Daisy?

1100
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:04,236
-It’s me, Benjamin.
-Benjamin?

1101
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,951
Oh, my God!

1102
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:15,164
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

1103
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:20,127
How are you?
It’s been such a long time.

1104
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,964
There's so much I want to know.
When did you get back?

1105
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,465
Well, I got back a few weeks ago.

1106
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:28,552
I spoke to Queenie, she said you were
in the war, somewhere at sea.

1107
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:32,390
-We were so, so worried about you.
-Oh, I’m okay.

1108
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:36,394
Well, look at you. You're so lovely.

1109
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,939
You stopped writing.

1110
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:47,154
"When I had left, she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place.

1111
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:50,658
"She was the most beautiful woman
I’d ever seen."

1112
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,076
Beautiful.

1113
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,080
"The most beautiful."

1114
01:28:57,874 --> 01:28:59,625
-You remember Grandma Fuller?
-Why, sure I do.

1115
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:02,795
-She passed.
-I heard that. I’m sorry.

1116
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:07,508
I just can't believe we're both here.
Must be fate.

1117
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:09,552
No, no, what do they call it?

1118
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:11,053
Kismet.

1119
01:29:11,138 --> 01:29:13,055
Do you know about Edgar Cayce,
the psychic?

1120
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:14,181
I don't believe l. . .

1121
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:17,143
He says
that everything is predetermined,

1122
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:20,604
but I like to think of it as fate.

1123
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:27,028
I’m not sure how it works,
but I’m glad it happened.

1124
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:30,740
Have you been to Manhattan?
It’s right across the river from me.

1125
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:32,992
Now, I can see
the Empire State Building

1126
01:29:33,076 --> 01:29:34,869
if I stand on my bed.

1127
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,954
What about you?
Where have you been?

1128
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,666
Tell me everything. Last time you wrote,
you said you'd been to Russia.

1129
01:29:40,751 --> 01:29:44,920
I’ve always wanted to go to Russia.
Is it as cold as they say?

1130
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:47,798
-Twice as cold.
-My goodness.

1131
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:53,095
We always said you were different.
But I think you really are.

1132
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:58,726
You wrote that you met somebody.
Did it work out?

1133
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:00,895
It ran its course.

1134
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,315
Hey, do you remember this?

1135
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,912
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1136
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:20,122
"at 5:00 in the afternoon."

1137
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,168
Would you like to have dinner?

1138
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:34,553
Did I telic you
that I danced for Balanchine?

1139
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:39,767
Oh, he's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.

1140
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:46,023
You know, in a rehearsal once,
a dancer fell.

1141
01:30:46,108 --> 01:30:48,943
And he just...
He just put it right into the production.

1142
01:30:49,027 --> 01:30:52,530
I mean, can you imagine that?
Like in a... In a classical ballet?

1143
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:55,866
You know, a dancer,
intentionally falling.

1144
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:59,620
There's a whole new word
for dance now. It’s called "abstract."

1145
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:01,038
No, he's not the only one, though.

1146
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:05,042
There's Lincoln Kirstein
and Lucia Chase, and oh, my...

1147
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:07,628
Oh, there's Agnes de Mille.

1148
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:09,797
She's just torn up all those conventions,

1149
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,882
you know,
ail that straight-up-and-down stuff.

1150
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:15,177
It’s not about the formality of the dance,
it's about what the dancer's feeling.

1151
01:31:15,262 --> 01:31:17,972
As she told me
about this big new world,

1152
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:20,599
names that didn't mean a thing to me,

1153
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:22,768
I didn't really hear very much
of what she was saying.

1154
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:25,104
It’s new and it's modern
and it's American.

1155
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:28,357
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

1156
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:30,609
Oh, my God.
I’ve just been talking and talking.

1157
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:35,197
No, no, I’ve enjoyed listening.
I didn't know you smoked.

1158
01:31:35,282 --> 01:31:36,866
I’m old enough.

1159
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:42,746
I’m old enough for a lot of things.

1160
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:48,085
In New York, we stay up all night,

1161
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:52,173
watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

1162
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:56,802
There's always something to do.

1163
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:16,614
I have to go back tomorrow.

1164
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:19,909
-So soon.
-Wish I could stay.

1165
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:27,875
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery anymore.

1166
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:31,503
I can imagine
dancing completely naked.

1167
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:35,174
Have you read D. H . Lawrence?

1168
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:37,384
-Well. . .
-His books were banned.

1169
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:41,013
The words are like making love.

1170
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:30,145
In our company,
we have to trust each other.

1171
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:39,113
Sex is a part of it.

1172
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:46,412
You know,
a lot of the dancers are lesbians.

1173
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:51,667
There was one woman
who wanted to sleep with me.

1174
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:01,969
-Does that upset you?
-Which part?

1175
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:05,514
Somebody wanting to sleep with me.

1176
01:34:06,016 --> 01:34:07,182
You're a desirable woman.

1177
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:11,020
I would think most of them
would want to sleep with you.

1178
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:13,230
Let's go back to the house.

1179
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:16,567
Or we could get a room somewhere.

1180
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:22,740
-We could lay down your jacket.
-I don't know, Daisy.

1181
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:28,203
It’s not that I wouldn't like to or anything.
I think I’ll just disappoint you.

1182
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,207
Oh, Benjamin, I’ve been with older men.

1183
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:35,002
You're going back to New York
in the morning.

1184
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:37,421
You should be with your friends.

1185
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,924
-You're only young once.
-Oh, I’m old enough.

1186
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:43,635
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

1187
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:59,318
We could go hear some music.

1188
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:04,281
Our lives are defined by opportunities.

1189
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:07,117
Even the ones we miss.

1190
01:35:08,078 --> 01:35:11,622
You look so handsome
and so distinguished.

1191
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,874
They're saying the hurricane's
gonna miss us, blow right on by.

1192
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:18,587
-Oh, that's great.
-I’ll stay under the blankets with Mother.

1193
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:22,800
She says nothing. . . Benjamin?

1194
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:25,761
"Things were becoming different. . ."

1195
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:27,054
...for me.

1196
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:30,724
My hair had very little gray
and grew like weeds.

1197
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:34,603
My sense of smell was keener.
My hearing, more acute.

1198
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:37,356
I could walk further and faster.

1199
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:43,237
While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger, all alone.

1200
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:47,491
Come in.

1201
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:50,202
Benjamin.

1202
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:54,415
-Do you remember me?
-Well, sure I do, Mr. Button.

1203
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:58,669
-What happened to you?
-Darn foot. Got infected, so. . .

1204
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:01,588
Welcome home, my friend.

1205
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:07,386
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

1206
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,720
Creature of habit.

1207
01:36:08,805 --> 01:36:10,931
You still visiting the house
on Bourbon Street?

1208
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:12,766
Not for a long time.

1209
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:16,437
Interesting times, though.

1210
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:20,983
We went from making 40,000
to nearly half a million buttons a day.

1211
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:23,110
We employed 1 0 times
the number of people.

1212
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:25,696
We were operating around the clock.

1213
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:31,660
Damn shame.

1214
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:35,706
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

1215
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:39,793
You know,

1216
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:45,382
I’m sick.
I don't know how much longer I have.

1217
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:48,343
-I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Button.
-No. . .

1218
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:52,806
I don't have any people.
I keep to myself.

1219
01:36:55,268 --> 01:36:58,312
I hope you don't mind,
but, whenever possible,

1220
01:36:58,396 --> 01:37:00,397
I’d enjoy your company.

1221
01:37:00,482 --> 01:37:03,025
I’ll certainly do what I can.

1222
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:09,239
Benjamin, do you know anything
about buttons?

1223
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:17,456
Now, Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 1 24 years.

1224
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:22,711
My grandfather was a tailor,
and he had a small shop in Richmond.

1225
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:25,214
After the Civil War,
he moved to New Orleans,

1226
01:37:25,298 --> 01:37:30,344
where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

1227
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:35,349
So, with his help,
the tailor shop grew to this.

1228
01:37:36,059 --> 01:37:38,685
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1229
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:45,234
That's very, very interesting.

1230
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:51,281
You sure have done well for yourself.

1231
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:56,286
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Button?

1232
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,833
Benjamin? You're my son.

1233
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:12,010
I’m so sorry I never told you before.

1234
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:17,558
You were born
the night the Great War ended.

1235
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:23,146
Your mother died giving birth to you.

1236
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:26,858
I thought you were a monster.

1237
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:33,699
I promised your mother
I’d make sure you were safe.

1238
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:42,583
I should never have abandoned you.

1239
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:48,046
My mother?

1240
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:52,342
At the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1241
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:55,887
When I was a boy,
I’d love to wake up before anyone else,

1242
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:59,016
run down to that lake
and watch the day begin.

1243
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:03,312
It was as if I was the only one alive.

1244
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:07,858
I fell in love the first time I saw her.

1245
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:11,028
Your mother's name
was Caroline Murphy.

1246
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:14,531
She worked
in your grandfather's kitchen.

1247
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:19,494
She's from Dublin.

1248
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:24,541
In 1 903, Caroline and all her brothers
and sisters came to live here,

1249
01:39:24,626 --> 01:39:26,209
in New Orleans.

1250
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:31,173
I’d find excuses
to go down to that kitchen

1251
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:34,134
just so I could look at her.

1252
01:39:40,475 --> 01:39:44,227
April 25th, 1918.
Happiest day of my life.

1253
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:47,230
The day I married your mother.

1254
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:51,109
Why didn't you just telic me?

1255
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:54,821
I plan on leaving everything I have
to you.

1256
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:58,784
-I have to go.
-Where?

1257
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:01,244
Home.

1258
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:03,246
And what does he think, anyway?

1259
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:04,665
He thinks he can just show up

1260
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,625
and everything's
supposed to be fine and dandy.

1261
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:09,336
Everybody's just supposed to be friends.

1262
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,339
Well, he got another thing coming,
that's for sure.

1263
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:15,842
God be my witness,
he got another thing coming.

1264
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:19,012
He left us $1 8 that night you was found.

1265
01:40:19,097 --> 01:40:20,931
Eighteen ratty dollars

1266
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,766
-and a filthy diaper.
-Good night, Mama.

1267
01:40:24,102 --> 01:40:25,310
Good night, baby.

1268
01:40:38,574 --> 01:40:42,953
Did I ever telic you
I was struck by lightning seven times?

1269
01:40:44,706 --> 01:40:46,790
Once, I was walking my dog
down the road.

1270
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:55,632
I’m blind in the one eye,
can't hardly hear,

1271
01:40:56,843 --> 01:41:01,471
get twitches and shakes out of nowhere,
always losing my line of thought.

1272
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:04,725
But you know what?

1273
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:08,437
God keeps reminding me
I’m lucky to be alive.

1274
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:15,736
Storm's coming.

1275
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:45,891
May I help you, sir?
Up the stairs, first bedroom.

1276
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:47,058
Thank you.

1277
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:04,201
Wake up.

1278
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:08,580
Let's get you dressed.

1279
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:37,651
Now that's something.

1280
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,280
Thank you.

1281
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:46,386
You can be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1282
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,930
You can swear and curse the Fates.

1283
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:52,726
But when it comes to the end,

1284
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:55,687
you have to let go.

1285
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:20,295
Well, it sure is a beautiful service.

1286
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:24,966
He’ll be buried
right next to your mother.

1287
01:44:26,385 --> 01:44:28,053
You're my mother.

1288
01:44:31,849 --> 01:44:33,141
My baby.

1289
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,856
Now, I’d never seen New York.

1290
01:46:08,029 --> 01:46:11,448
-Excuse me, I’m a friend of Daisy's.
-Right this way.

1291
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:17,829
-Daisy has company. Daisy! Daisy!
-Yes!

1292
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:21,499
-We need the wardrobe.
-Is somebody looking for me?

1293
01:46:24,086 --> 01:46:26,296
-Benjamin.
-Hi.

1294
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:31,384
-What are you doing here?
-Thought I’d come visit.

1295
01:46:31,469 --> 01:46:34,929
Spend some time with you, if I could.

1296
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:40,935
Oh, well, I wish you would've called.
You took me by surprise.

1297
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:46,441
-You can just throw them out.
-No. Thank you, they're lovely.

1298
01:46:47,026 --> 01:46:51,863
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.
I thought you were mesmerizing.

1299
01:46:53,866 --> 01:46:56,701
Thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

1300
01:47:01,999 --> 01:47:04,084
I better get changed.
A group of us are going to a party.

1301
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:07,420
-Would you want to come?
-Someone told me about a restaurant

1302
01:47:07,505 --> 01:47:08,797
I thought you might enjoy.

1303
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:11,424
I made a reservation, just in case.

1304
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:14,511
Just, all the dancers go out
after the show. You're. . .

1305
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:18,431
You're welcome to come with us.
I’ll get changed. All right?

1306
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:26,981
She choreographs
for the Ballets Russes.

1307
01:47:27,066 --> 01:47:28,399
She's divine.

1308
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:30,860
You were breathtaking.

1309
01:47:36,534 --> 01:47:37,826
Sweetie.

1310
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:41,871
This is David.
He dances with the company.

1311
01:47:42,832 --> 01:47:44,874
-This is Benjamin.
-Who?

1312
01:47:44,959 --> 01:47:48,211
-I told you about him.
-Oh, yeah. How you doing?

1313
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:51,798
-I’ll go get you a drink.
-All right. Thanks.

1314
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:02,642
So, you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

1315
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,686
Or something like that?

1316
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:07,605
Something like that.

1317
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:09,482
Hey, excuse me.

1318
01:48:31,797 --> 01:48:33,089
Come on.

1319
01:48:54,403 --> 01:48:55,486
Hey!

1320
01:48:56,447 --> 01:48:58,948
Now, I had no idea you were coming.

1321
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:01,534
Lord, Benjamin.

1322
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:07,999
What did you expect?
What, you want me to drop everything?

1323
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:10,043
Now, this is my life.

1324
01:49:10,127 --> 01:49:12,629
Babe! You going downtown?

1325
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:20,678
Come on. You’ll have a good time.

1326
01:49:21,513 --> 01:49:23,056
There's lots of musicians,
interesting people.

1327
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:26,059
You don't have to do that.
This is my fault.

1328
01:49:27,144 --> 01:49:28,561
I should've called.

1329
01:49:28,646 --> 01:49:31,481
I thought I’d come here

1330
01:49:31,565 --> 01:49:34,317
and sweep you off your feet
or something.

1331
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:40,323
-Daisy! Come on! Let's go.
-Be right there.

1332
01:49:42,076 --> 01:49:43,493
Seems nice.

1333
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:46,454
Do you love him?

1334
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:50,959
I think so.

1335
01:49:53,045 --> 01:49:54,754
I’m happy for you.

1336
01:49:56,674 --> 01:49:58,800
Maybe I’ll see you at home.

1337
01:50:01,387 --> 01:50:02,512
Okay.

1338
01:50:04,515 --> 01:50:06,307
I enjoyed the show!

1339
01:50:13,899 --> 01:50:18,444
He came to telic me his father had died.

1340
01:50:19,905 --> 01:50:26,119
-You couldn't have known.
-I was 23. l. . . I just didn't care.

1341
01:50:28,664 --> 01:50:30,039
What did you do next?

1342
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:37,088
Some photographs, I think,
in the front of my bag.

1343
01:50:39,174 --> 01:50:43,303
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

1344
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:47,140
For five years, l. . .

1345
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:51,686
I danced everywhere.

1346
01:50:53,105 --> 01:50:56,649
London, Vienna, Prague.

1347
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:59,110
I’ve never seen these.

1348
01:51:02,406 --> 01:51:03,531
Mom.

1349
01:51:04,783 --> 01:51:07,493
You never talked about your dancing.

1350
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:09,620
Well, I was the only American

1351
01:51:09,705 --> 01:51:14,667
to be invited to dance
with the Bolshoi, sugar.

1352
01:51:16,503 --> 01:51:18,546
It was glorious.

1353
01:51:22,968 --> 01:51:26,721
But Benjamin was never far
from my thoughts.

1354
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:33,436
And I’d find myself saying...

1355
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,355
Good night, Benjamin.

1356
01:51:37,316 --> 01:51:40,985
-"Good night, Daisy."
-He said that?

1357
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:44,280
"Life wasn't all that complicated.

1358
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:47,950
"If you want, you might say
I was looking for something."

1359
01:51:57,419 --> 01:52:00,421
Benjamin?
Mrs. La Tourneau just passed.

1360
01:52:06,804 --> 01:52:10,473
-Letter for Mr. Benjamin Button?
-That'd be me.

1361
01:52:13,352 --> 01:52:14,727
Thank you.

1362
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:42,922
Miss Daisy Fuller.

1363
01:52:43,006 --> 01:52:45,842
-Just a minute. Please have a seat.
-Sure.

1364
01:52:53,308 --> 01:52:57,728
Sometimes we're on a collision course
and we just don't know it.

1365
01:52:58,272 --> 01:53:02,817
Whether it's by accident or by design,
there's not a thing we can do about it.

1366
01:53:05,612 --> 01:53:08,698
A woman in Paris was on her way
to go shopping.

1367
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:13,786
But she had forgotten her coat,
went back to get it.

1368
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:16,080
When she had gotten her coat,
the phone had rung.

1369
01:53:16,165 --> 01:53:19,208
So she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.

1370
01:53:20,669 --> 01:53:22,462
While the woman was on the phone,

1371
01:53:22,546 --> 01:53:26,757
Daisy was rehearsing for a performance
at the Paris Opera House.

1372
01:53:26,842 --> 01:53:29,635
And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,

1373
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:32,054
had gone outside to get a taxi.

1374
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,853
Now, a taxi driver had
dropped off a fare earlier,

1375
01:53:38,937 --> 01:53:41,689
and had stopped to get a cup of coffee.

1376
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:45,318
And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing.

1377
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:51,324
And this cab driver,
who dropped off the earlier fare

1378
01:53:51,408 --> 01:53:53,409
and had stopped
to get the cup of coffee,

1379
01:53:53,494 --> 01:53:55,203
he picked up the lady
who was going shopping

1380
01:53:55,287 --> 01:53:58,039
and had missed getting the earlier cab.

1381
01:53:58,957 --> 01:54:01,375
The taxi had to stop
for a man crossing the street,

1382
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:04,295
who had left for work five minutes later
than he normally did

1383
01:54:04,379 --> 01:54:06,923
because he forgot to set his alarm.

1384
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:10,968
While that man, late for work,
was crossing the street,

1385
01:54:11,053 --> 01:54:14,514
Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.

1386
01:54:15,015 --> 01:54:16,349
And while Daisy was showering,

1387
01:54:16,433 --> 01:54:20,061
the taxi was waiting outside a boutique
for the woman to pick up a package

1388
01:54:20,145 --> 01:54:21,270
which hadn't been wrapped yet,

1389
01:54:21,355 --> 01:54:23,189
because the girl
who was supposed to wrap it

1390
01:54:23,273 --> 01:54:26,901
had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before and forgot.

1391
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:30,738
When the package was wrapped,
the woman, who was back in the cab,

1392
01:54:30,822 --> 01:54:32,490
was blocked by a delivery truck.

1393
01:54:32,574 --> 01:54:35,326
All the while,
Daisy was getting dressed.

1394
01:54:36,787 --> 01:54:40,206
The delivery truck pulled away,
and the taxi was able to move

1395
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,375
while Daisy, the last to be dressed,

1396
01:54:42,459 --> 01:54:46,045
waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.

1397
01:54:46,463 --> 01:54:49,382
While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,

1398
01:54:49,466 --> 01:54:53,386
Daisy and her friend
came out the back of the theater.

1399
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:56,889
And if only one thing
had happened differently,

1400
01:54:56,974 --> 01:54:59,058
if that shoelace hadn't broken

1401
01:54:59,142 --> 01:55:01,686
or that delivery truck
had moved moments earlier

1402
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:03,646
or that package
had been wrapped and ready

1403
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:06,482
because the girl hadn't broken up
with her boyfriend,

1404
01:55:06,567 --> 01:55:10,236
or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier

1405
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,531
or that taxi driver hadn't stopped
for a cup of coffee

1406
01:55:13,615 --> 01:55:17,660
or that woman had remembered
her coat and got into an earlier cab,

1407
01:55:18,161 --> 01:55:20,871
Daisy and her friend
would have crossed the street

1408
01:55:20,956 --> 01:55:23,416
and the taxi would have driven by.

1409
01:55:34,469 --> 01:55:36,220
But, life being what it is,

1410
01:55:36,305 --> 01:55:39,307
a series of intersecting lives
and incidents

1411
01:55:39,391 --> 01:55:41,183
out of anyone's control,

1412
01:55:42,019 --> 01:55:44,770
that taxi did not go by,

1413
01:55:44,855 --> 01:55:47,690
and that driver was
momentarily distracted.

1414
01:55:48,692 --> 01:55:49,692
Daisy!

1415
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:51,110
And that taxi hit Daisy.

1416
01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:52,945
Daisy! Help!

1417
01:55:56,074 --> 01:55:58,075
And her leg was crushed.

1418
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:06,667
Daisy?

1419
01:56:10,922 --> 01:56:13,507
-Who told you?
-Your friend wired me.

1420
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:18,638
Very kind of you to come all this way
to see that I was all right.

1421
01:56:20,182 --> 01:56:22,224
You'd do the same for me.

1422
01:56:24,102 --> 01:56:25,353
My God.

1423
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:30,941
Look at you. You're perfect.

1424
01:56:33,737 --> 01:56:38,282
I wish you hadn't come here.
I don't want you to see me like this.

1425
01:56:44,706 --> 01:56:46,999
Her leg had been broken in five places.

1426
01:56:47,084 --> 01:56:50,252
And with therapy and time,
she might walk again.

1427
01:56:51,755 --> 01:56:53,673
But she'd never dance.

1428
01:56:55,258 --> 01:56:57,718
I’m gonna take you home with me.

1429
01:56:57,803 --> 01:57:00,596
-I want to look after you.
-I’m not going back to New Orleans.

1430
01:57:00,681 --> 01:57:02,890
Then I’ll stay here in Paris.

1431
01:57:03,475 --> 01:57:06,435
Don't you understand?
I don't want your help.

1432
01:57:07,521 --> 01:57:11,857
I know I’m feeling sorry for myself,
but I don't want to be with you.

1433
01:57:11,942 --> 01:57:15,736
Tried to telic you that in New York.
You don't listen.

1434
01:57:17,239 --> 01:57:19,198
You might change your mind.

1435
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:22,284
We are not little children
anymore, Benjamin.

1436
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:27,540
Just stay out of my life.

1437
01:57:50,355 --> 01:57:53,649
I was awfully cruel.

1438
01:57:54,693 --> 01:58:00,156
He didn't understand.
I couldn't have him see me like that.

1439
01:58:02,826 --> 01:58:04,201
"I didn't leave right away.

1440
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:10,166
"I stayed in Paris for a while
to look out for her."

1441
01:58:13,712 --> 01:58:15,588
I never knew that.

1442
01:58:18,967 --> 01:58:23,053
Oh, darling, could you get the nurse?

1443
01:58:26,725 --> 01:58:31,854
I taught myself to walk again.

1444
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:37,485
I took the train to Lourdes.

1445
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:44,408
Let's take a look. That's normal.
Pulse rate is slowing.

1446
01:58:44,493 --> 01:58:46,494
She is gonna struggle to breathe.

1447
01:58:46,578 --> 01:58:48,829
-Will you be all right?
-Yeah.

1448
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:07,890
All right, he says, "I went back home."
And then there's a lot of pages torn out.

1449
01:59:08,099 --> 01:59:11,852
"I listened to the sound of the house."
I read that already.

1450
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:13,854
He. . .

1451
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:18,067
He spilt something on it,
so it's hard to read, Mom.

1452
01:59:19,194 --> 01:59:21,987
Something about sailing,
does that make sense?

1453
01:59:22,697 --> 01:59:26,075
I learned to sail an old boat
of my father's from the lake house.

1454
01:59:35,252 --> 01:59:37,253
I can't lie.

1455
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:40,172
I did enjoy the company
of a woman or two.

1456
01:59:48,473 --> 01:59:50,057
Or maybe three.

1457
02:00:26,553 --> 02:00:30,806
Don't know why you bother, Sam,
just gonna be there again tomorrow.

1458
02:00:35,145 --> 02:00:36,312
Mama.

1459
02:00:41,151 --> 02:00:43,652
And in the spring of 1 962,

1460
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:49,033
she came back.

1461
02:01:08,386 --> 02:01:12,056
-You want to know where I’ve been?
-No.

1462
02:01:14,017 --> 02:01:18,938
How come you didn't write or nothing?
Just disappearing like that.

1463
02:01:19,022 --> 02:01:21,607
It was something I needed to do
for myself.

1464
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:25,444
Yeah, well, I never took you
to be the selfish type.

1465
02:01:25,528 --> 02:01:28,030
I sure hope I’m not wrong.

1466
02:01:29,157 --> 02:01:31,241
I’m usually not wrong about people.

1467
02:01:31,326 --> 02:01:33,869
-Good night, Mama.
-Good night, baby.

1468
02:01:34,829 --> 02:01:36,497
Y'all have fun.

1469
02:01:39,209 --> 02:01:43,587
-You haven't said two words.
-I don't want to ruin it.

1470
02:02:13,743 --> 02:02:16,078
-Sleep with me?
-Absolutely.

1471
02:02:53,825 --> 02:02:56,285
I asked her to come away with me.

1472
02:02:58,496 --> 02:03:01,623
We sailed into the Gulf
along the Florida Keys.

1473
02:03:42,957 --> 02:03:47,336
I am so glad we didn't find one another
when I was 26.

1474
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:51,757
-Why do you say that?
-I was so young.

1475
02:03:51,841 --> 02:03:53,634
And you were so old.

1476
02:03:54,302 --> 02:03:57,221
It happened
when it was supposed to happen.

1477
02:03:57,305 --> 02:04:00,474
I will enjoy each and every moment
I have with you.

1478
02:04:05,605 --> 02:04:08,107
I bet I can stay out here longer than you.

1479
02:04:08,191 --> 02:04:09,817
I bet you can't.

1480
02:04:12,654 --> 02:04:15,197
Barely a line or a crease.

1481
02:04:15,573 --> 02:04:18,742
Every day I have more wrinkles.
It’s not fair.

1482
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:24,164
I love your wrinkles. Both of them.

1483
02:04:29,838 --> 02:04:32,172
What's it like growing younger?

1484
02:04:34,592 --> 02:04:39,221
I can't really say.
I’m always looking out my own eyes.

1485
02:04:44,227 --> 02:04:48,021
Will you still love me
when my skin grows old and saggy?

1486
02:04:48,106 --> 02:04:52,609
Will you still love me when I have acne?
When I wet the bed?

1487
02:04:53,903 --> 02:04:56,780
When I’m afraid
of what's under the stairs?

1488
02:05:04,247 --> 02:05:05,330
What?

1489
02:05:11,337 --> 02:05:15,340
-What are you thinking?
-Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1490
02:05:17,719 --> 02:05:19,761
And what a shame that is.

1491
02:05:22,724 --> 02:05:24,391
Some things last.

1492
02:05:26,644 --> 02:05:30,898
-Good night, Daisy.
-Good night, Benjamin.

1493
02:05:47,290 --> 02:05:48,373
Mom?

1494
02:05:50,627 --> 02:05:54,671
-When did you meet Dad?
-Some time after that.

1495
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:02,554
-Did you telic him about this Benjamin?
-He knew enough, darling.

1496
02:06:22,533 --> 02:06:23,659
Mama?

1497
02:06:30,833 --> 02:06:32,125
Queenie?

1498
02:06:35,255 --> 02:06:36,588
Hello?

1499
02:06:37,006 --> 02:06:40,634
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

1500
02:06:40,718 --> 02:06:45,931
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.
I’m so sorry.

1501
02:07:14,585 --> 02:07:18,005
I’m so sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

1502
02:07:18,089 --> 02:07:19,923
Our deepest condolences.

1503
02:07:25,054 --> 02:07:28,098
We buried her
beside her beloved Mr. Weathers.

1504
02:07:35,064 --> 02:07:38,567
And so we might have memories
of our own,

1505
02:07:38,651 --> 02:07:40,610
we sold my father's house
on Esplanade.

1506
02:07:40,695 --> 02:07:43,322
It is a wonderful old place, darling.

1507
02:07:43,906 --> 02:07:46,825
I think we are going to be
so happy here.

1508
02:07:46,909 --> 02:07:49,828
Oh, what a long family history you have.

1509
02:07:49,912 --> 02:07:51,913
They come with the house.

1510
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:57,419
-Come on.
-You have to see the master suite.

1511
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:01,173
We bought ourselves a duplex.

1512
02:08:03,217 --> 02:08:05,260
I loved that house.

1513
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,681
It smelled like firewood.

1514
02:08:10,767 --> 02:08:14,019
Don't. . . Don't stop, darling.

1515
02:08:14,604 --> 02:08:17,481
"It was one of the happiest times
of my life."

1516
02:08:17,565 --> 02:08:20,108
We didn't have a stick of furniture.

1517
02:08:20,902 --> 02:08:23,653
We would have picnics
in the living room.

1518
02:08:27,116 --> 02:08:31,119
We ate when we felt like it.
Stayed up all night when we wanted.

1519
02:08:32,538 --> 02:08:34,539
We vowed never to fall into routine,

1520
02:08:34,624 --> 02:08:37,501
to go to bed or wake up
at the same time.

1521
02:08:37,585 --> 02:08:39,628
We lived on that mattress.

1522
02:09:15,331 --> 02:09:18,834
Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.

1523
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:23,171
We lived four blocks from a public pool.

1524
02:10:01,544 --> 02:10:04,337
You know, you might've got
a few more years out of it,

1525
02:10:04,422 --> 02:10:08,550
but you chose to do
something so special and unique

1526
02:10:09,969 --> 02:10:13,722
that there was only
a short window of time you could do it.

1527
02:10:15,516 --> 02:10:18,018
So, even if nothing ever happened,

1528
02:10:18,102 --> 02:10:21,229
you'd still be right here
where you are now.

1529
02:10:21,314 --> 02:10:23,565
I just don't like getting old.

1530
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:27,652
They put too much chlorine in here.

1531
02:11:08,903 --> 02:11:12,781
I promise you I’ll never lose myself
to self-pity again.

1532
02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:20,205
And I think right there and then

1533
02:11:20,289 --> 02:11:24,292
she realized
none of us is perfect forever.

1534
02:11:28,256 --> 02:11:29,881
She found peace.

1535
02:11:31,759 --> 02:11:34,678
She opened a studio
and taught young girls how to dance.

1536
02:11:34,762 --> 02:11:37,889
And tendu.

1537
02:11:37,974 --> 02:11:43,061
Come back the other way.
And spot, spot, spot. Excellent.

1538
02:11:44,730 --> 02:11:47,190
-Good night, Miss Daisy.
-Good night.

1539
02:12:12,675 --> 02:12:15,302
You certainly are beautiful to watch.

1540
02:12:17,096 --> 02:12:19,514
Dancing's all about the line.

1541
02:12:21,767 --> 02:12:23,685
The line of your body.

1542
02:12:25,021 --> 02:12:29,357
Sooner or later, you lose that line,
and you never get it back.

1543
02:12:35,239 --> 02:12:41,202
I figure, you were born in 1 91 8,
49 years ago.

1544
02:12:41,287 --> 02:12:42,829
I’m 43.

1545
02:12:44,999 --> 02:12:47,542
We are almost the same age.

1546
02:12:50,838 --> 02:12:55,050
-We're meeting in the middle.
-We finally caught up with each other.

1547
02:12:56,218 --> 02:12:57,344
Wait.

1548
02:12:58,679 --> 02:13:01,348
I want to remember us
just as we are now.

1549
02:13:12,193 --> 02:13:13,693
I’m pregnant.

1550
02:13:31,379 --> 02:13:35,048
You know, I swear the nurse slipped
and said it was a boy.

1551
02:13:50,022 --> 02:13:52,023
But I think it's a girl.

1552
02:13:57,321 --> 02:14:00,907
-I know you're afraid.
-I’m not hiding it.

1553
02:14:00,991 --> 02:14:02,117
Okay.

1554
02:14:09,458 --> 02:14:12,043
-What's your worst fear?
-Baby born like me.

1555
02:14:12,128 --> 02:14:14,587
Then I will love it all the more.

1556
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:21,553
Okay. How can I be a father
when I’m heading in the other direction?

1557
02:14:22,179 --> 02:14:25,515
It’s not fair to a child.
I don't want to be anybody's burden.

1558
02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:28,476
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1559
02:14:29,937 --> 02:14:31,980
I am gonna make this work.

1560
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:37,569
I want this, and I want it with you.

1561
02:14:37,653 --> 02:14:41,072
I want you to have everything you want,
all of it.

1562
02:14:41,157 --> 02:14:44,367
I’m just not sure how to reconcile this.

1563
02:14:44,452 --> 02:14:46,536
Would you telic a blind man
he couldn't have children?

1564
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:48,204
Here you go.

1565
02:14:48,289 --> 02:14:51,750
You’ll be a father for as long as you can.

1566
02:14:51,834 --> 02:14:54,627
I know the consequences.
I’ve accepted that.

1567
02:14:54,712 --> 02:14:57,338
Loving you is worth everything to me.

1568
02:15:01,844 --> 02:15:03,511
I have to go pee.

1569
02:15:17,568 --> 02:15:19,819
The oldest woman
to ever swim the English Channel

1570
02:15:19,904 --> 02:15:21,654
arrived here today in Calais...

1571
02:15:21,739 --> 02:15:24,240
-Keep it.
-...having made the swim in 34 hours,

1572
02:15:24,325 --> 02:15:26,534
22 minutes and 1 4 seconds.

1573
02:15:26,619 --> 02:15:31,456
The 68-year-old Elizabeth Abbott
arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,

1574
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:33,333
exhausted but happy.

1575
02:15:33,417 --> 02:15:36,961
Miss Abbott, how would you sum up,
in words, this achievement?

1576
02:15:37,046 --> 02:15:38,671
I suppose...

1577
02:15:40,049 --> 02:15:41,800
Anything's possible.

1578
02:15:45,805 --> 02:15:46,971
-All right?
-Yes. Thank you.

1579
02:15:47,056 --> 02:15:48,056
-You ready?
-Thank you very much.

1580
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:50,099
Thank you. Thank you all.

1581
02:15:50,184 --> 02:15:52,185
-Yeah.
-You're very kind.

1582
02:15:59,401 --> 02:16:03,279
In the spring, on a day like any other...

1583
02:16:04,031 --> 02:16:06,032
I’ll be back in an hour!

1584
02:16:11,038 --> 02:16:12,247
Honey?

1585
02:16:14,291 --> 02:16:16,334
Go and call an ambulance!

1586
02:16:19,255 --> 02:16:20,922
The baby's coming.

1587
02:16:21,757 --> 02:16:22,799
Operator, I need an ambulance.

1588
02:16:22,883 --> 02:16:25,343
-The baby's coming!
-271 4 Napoleon.

1589
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:35,270
There you go. Keep breathing.

1590
02:16:36,146 --> 02:16:38,565
Deep breaths. Push.

1591
02:16:48,450 --> 02:16:49,868
There we go.

1592
02:17:06,260 --> 02:17:09,637
Everyone's fine.
She's a perfectly healthy baby girl.

1593
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:17,729
Honey?

1594
02:17:19,648 --> 02:17:23,318
She gave birth to a five pound,
four ounce baby girl.

1595
02:17:39,501 --> 02:17:41,419
Did you count the toes?

1596
02:17:45,716 --> 02:17:47,258
She's perfect.

1597
02:17:47,676 --> 02:17:50,970
"And we named her
for my mother, Caroline."

1598
02:17:54,683 --> 02:17:56,851
This Benjamin was my father?

1599
02:17:58,354 --> 02:18:00,521
And this is how you telic me?

1600
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:07,445
Excuse me.

1601
02:18:17,915 --> 02:18:20,667
...because all the ingredients are there
for a major storm,

1602
02:18:20,751 --> 02:18:23,336
possibly even up to a Category 5.

1603
02:18:30,052 --> 02:18:33,763
Hey, I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

1604
02:18:37,017 --> 02:18:39,018
Nobody can telic you exactly
where it's gonna hit,

1605
02:18:39,103 --> 02:18:41,229
but we have to go with the guidance
that we have,

1606
02:18:41,313 --> 02:18:45,066
incorporate that information
and then pass it along to you.

1607
02:18:51,907 --> 02:18:56,744
"You grew as the doctor had promised,
normal and healthy."

1608
02:19:05,421 --> 02:19:08,548
You're gonna have to find a real father
for her.

1609
02:19:11,677 --> 02:19:13,469
What are you talking about?

1610
02:19:13,554 --> 02:19:16,848
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

1611
02:19:16,932 --> 02:19:19,767
She’ll learn to accept
whatever happens. She loves you.

1612
02:19:19,852 --> 02:19:22,603
Honey, she needs a father,
not a playmate.

1613
02:19:26,734 --> 02:19:28,026
-Is it me?
-Of course not.

1614
02:19:28,110 --> 02:19:30,111
-Is my age beginning to bother you?
-Of course not.

1615
02:19:30,195 --> 02:19:34,240
-Is that what you're telling me?
-You can't raise the both of us.

1616
02:19:42,875 --> 02:19:47,795
It was your first birthday.
We had a party for you.

1617
02:19:48,547 --> 02:19:50,381
The house was filled with children.

1618
02:19:50,466 --> 02:19:52,425
-How are you?
-Hey, man.

1619
02:19:52,509 --> 02:19:56,179
Before you turn around,
they’ll be in high school, dating.

1620
02:20:28,587 --> 02:20:32,590
I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain,

1621
02:20:32,674 --> 02:20:35,426
I sold Button's Buttons,

1622
02:20:35,511 --> 02:20:40,056
I sold my father's sailboat,
put it all into a savings account.

1623
02:20:42,309 --> 02:20:45,520
And so that you
and your mother might have a life,

1624
02:20:46,730 --> 02:20:50,691
I left,
before you could ever remember me.

1625
02:21:40,367 --> 02:21:42,577
"I left with just the clothes on my back."

1626
02:21:43,912 --> 02:21:48,583
I don't want to read this now.
Can you just telic me where he went?

1627
02:21:50,043 --> 02:21:52,295
I don't really know.

1628
02:22:03,557 --> 02:22:08,519
It’s for me. 1 970. I was two.
"Happy Birthday.

1629
02:22:11,273 --> 02:22:14,150
"I wish
I could have kissed you good night."

1630
02:22:19,239 --> 02:22:20,990
They're all for me.

1631
02:22:21,992 --> 02:22:26,996
Five. "I wish I could have taken you
to your first day of school."

1632
02:22:31,501 --> 02:22:37,381
Six. "I wish I could have been there
to teach you to play piano."

1633
02:22:40,802 --> 02:22:43,763
1 981 , 1 3.

1634
02:22:43,847 --> 02:22:47,183
"I wish I could have told you
not to chase some boy.

1635
02:22:48,477 --> 02:22:52,146
"I wish I could have held you
when you had a broken heart.

1636
02:22:53,649 --> 02:22:59,445
"I wish I could have been your father.
Nothing I ever did will replace that."

1637
02:23:06,912 --> 02:23:09,455
I guess he went to India.

1638
02:23:09,539 --> 02:23:11,999
"For what it's worth, it's never too late,

1639
02:23:12,084 --> 02:23:13,918
-"or, in my case, too early. . ."
-...or, in my case, too early,

1640
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:17,171
to be whoever you want to be.

1641
02:23:21,176 --> 02:23:23,886
There's no time limit.
Start whenever you want.

1642
02:23:26,765 --> 02:23:31,269
You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.

1643
02:23:33,814 --> 02:23:37,316
We can make the best or the worst of it.

1644
02:23:37,401 --> 02:23:39,735
And I hope you make the best of it.

1645
02:23:42,823 --> 02:23:45,533
I hope you see things that startle you.

1646
02:23:47,703 --> 02:23:51,205
I hope you feel things
you never felt before.

1647
02:23:53,667 --> 02:23:57,211
I hope you meet people
with a different point of view.

1648
02:23:58,338 --> 02:24:01,048
I hope you live a life you're proud of.

1649
02:24:04,052 --> 02:24:09,098
And if you find that you're not,
I hope you have the strength

1650
02:24:09,182 --> 02:24:12,393
-to start all over again.
-". . .start all over again."

1651
02:24:13,937 --> 02:24:17,690
He had been gone a long time.

1652
02:24:19,443 --> 02:24:21,569
I’ll see you next Thursday.

1653
02:24:24,531 --> 02:24:27,908
-Good night, Miss Daisy.
-Oh, good night, sweetheart.

1654
02:24:45,761 --> 02:24:47,762
I’m sorry, we're closing.

1655
02:24:50,682 --> 02:24:52,266
Can I help you?

1656
02:24:53,810 --> 02:24:56,270
Are you here to pick somebody up?

1657
02:25:06,615 --> 02:25:08,491
Why did you come back?

1658
02:25:10,077 --> 02:25:13,496
Mom?

1659
02:25:14,706 --> 02:25:16,248
You ready yet?

1660
02:25:19,211 --> 02:25:20,336
Mom, what's wrong?

1661
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:24,006
I was just hearing a very sad story
about a mutual friend

1662
02:25:24,091 --> 02:25:26,801
who I hadn't seen for a very long time.

1663
02:25:28,053 --> 02:25:30,805
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1664
02:25:30,889 --> 02:25:33,641
You knew him
when you were just a baby.

1665
02:25:36,061 --> 02:25:37,311
-Hi.
-Hi.

1666
02:25:39,231 --> 02:25:41,148
Hey.

1667
02:25:43,110 --> 02:25:47,947
-Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you were done.
-Oh, this is a friend of my family's.

1668
02:25:48,031 --> 02:25:52,993
Benjamin Button,
this is my husband, Robert.

1669
02:25:53,078 --> 02:25:55,496
-How do you do?
-A pleasure.

1670
02:26:03,630 --> 02:26:06,632
Well, it was very nice to meet you.

1671
02:26:06,716 --> 02:26:08,551
-We’ll be in the car, darling.
-All right.

1672
02:26:08,635 --> 02:26:09,802
Bye.

1673
02:26:10,512 --> 02:26:12,304
I’m just locking up.

1674
02:26:17,018 --> 02:26:18,144
Wow.

1675
02:26:20,647 --> 02:26:23,524
She's beautiful. Like her mother.

1676
02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:27,611
-Does she dance?
-Not very well.

1677
02:26:27,696 --> 02:26:29,613
I guess that'd be
from my side of things.

1678
02:26:29,698 --> 02:26:31,699
She's a dear, sweet girl.

1679
02:26:32,868 --> 02:26:37,246
She seems a little lost.
But then, who isn't at 1 2?

1680
02:26:37,414 --> 02:26:41,709
A lot of her reminds me of you.

1681
02:26:42,544 --> 02:26:46,547
My husband, he's a widower, or was. . .
Was a widower.

1682
02:26:46,882 --> 02:26:50,843
He's an incredibly kind, just bright,
adventurous man.

1683
02:26:53,972 --> 02:26:56,724
-He's been a terrific father.
-Good.

1684
02:27:01,396 --> 02:27:05,316
-You are so much younger.
-Only on the outside.

1685
02:27:07,402 --> 02:27:08,944
You were right.

1686
02:27:10,697 --> 02:27:14,074
I couldn't have been raising both of you.

1687
02:27:14,159 --> 02:27:15,951
I’m not that strong.

1688
02:27:20,123 --> 02:27:22,208
So, where are you staying?

1689
02:27:24,836 --> 02:27:25,836
What are you gonna do?

1690
02:27:25,921 --> 02:27:29,757
I’m staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel
on the Avenue.

1691
02:27:29,841 --> 02:27:33,385
I don't know what I’m gonna do.

1692
02:27:33,470 --> 02:27:34,678
But. . .

1693
02:27:41,144 --> 02:27:42,811
They're waiting.

1694
02:28:24,938 --> 02:28:28,232
I remember that. That was him?

1695
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:32,069
The hurricane has changed directions.

1696
02:28:32,153 --> 02:28:33,988
It’s going to make landfall
sometime soon.

1697
02:28:34,072 --> 02:28:35,823
-Am I supposed to do something?
-Arrangements are being made

1698
02:28:35,907 --> 02:28:37,157
to move people, but it's up to you.

1699
02:28:37,242 --> 02:28:39,118
No. No, we're. . . We're staying.

1700
02:28:39,202 --> 02:28:41,870
I’ll let you know if anything changes.

1701
02:28:43,873 --> 02:28:48,252
"That night, while I was sitting
and wondering why I came back at all,

1702
02:28:48,336 --> 02:28:50,671
"there was a knock at the door."

1703
02:28:54,301 --> 02:28:55,551
Come in.

1704
02:29:09,858 --> 02:29:11,525
Are you all right?

1705
02:29:14,613 --> 02:29:18,741
I’m sorry,
I don't know what I’m doing here.

1706
02:29:27,751 --> 02:29:29,293
Nothing lasts.

1707
02:29:32,714 --> 02:29:35,090
I have never stopped loving you.

1708
02:29:41,056 --> 02:29:43,807
Oh, but, Benjamin,
I’m an old woman now.

1709
02:29:54,402 --> 02:29:56,654
Some things you never forget.

1710
02:30:16,925 --> 02:30:18,008
...so few people even know

1711
02:30:18,093 --> 02:30:19,802
that you were ever in jail
in the first place.

1712
02:30:19,886 --> 02:30:22,096
I’ll telic you, I am sick about it, too,

1713
02:30:22,180 --> 02:30:24,765
because, please,
if they're not gonna give you an award

1714
02:30:24,849 --> 02:30:26,934
like "Man of the Year,"
at least what they could do

1715
02:30:27,018 --> 02:30:29,687
is stop having you listed
as an ex-convict

1716
02:30:29,771 --> 02:30:32,314
which I think is, again, so unfair.

1717
02:30:45,078 --> 02:30:46,912
Good night, Benjamin.

1718
02:30:48,415 --> 02:30:50,124
Good night, Daisy.

1719
02:30:53,294 --> 02:30:57,548
And as I knew I would,
I watched her go.

1720
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:02,594
That's the last thing he wrote.

1721
02:31:03,722 --> 02:31:08,308
Sometime after your father passed,

1722
02:31:08,393 --> 02:31:11,270
there was a call.

1723
02:31:14,315 --> 02:31:15,482
Hello.

1724
02:31:16,568 --> 02:31:18,110
Yes, speaking.

1725
02:31:21,406 --> 02:31:23,907
I’m sorry, I don't understand.

1726
02:31:33,710 --> 02:31:35,627
It’s the corner house.

1727
02:31:57,776 --> 02:31:59,193
Come on in.

1728
02:32:04,741 --> 02:32:06,784
-I’m Daisy Fuller.
-I’m David Hernandez,

1729
02:32:06,868 --> 02:32:10,621
with the Orleans Parish Department
of Child Welfare Services.

1730
02:32:10,705 --> 02:32:13,373
He was living in a condemned building.

1731
02:32:15,126 --> 02:32:17,461
The police found this with him.

1732
02:32:17,545 --> 02:32:20,506
This address.
It’s got your name in it a lot.

1733
02:32:21,674 --> 02:32:24,301
He's in very poor health.
He was taken to the hospital.

1734
02:32:24,385 --> 02:32:28,472
He doesn't seem to know who
or where he is. He's very confused.

1735
02:32:28,556 --> 02:32:32,142
I was telling Mr. Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

1736
02:32:32,227 --> 02:32:36,063
lf he needs a place to stay,
it's all right, he can stay here.

1737
02:33:05,510 --> 02:33:06,802
Benjamin?

1738
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:12,474
You play beautifully.

1739
02:33:15,937 --> 02:33:17,813
He doesn't seem to like to be touched.

1740
02:33:17,897 --> 02:33:19,565
He goes in and out
of states of recognition.

1741
02:33:19,649 --> 02:33:21,316
The doctors say,
if they didn't know any better,

1742
02:33:21,401 --> 02:33:23,861
he has the beginnings of dementia.

1743
02:33:25,613 --> 02:33:27,406
Do you remember me?

1744
02:33:30,535 --> 02:33:31,910
I’m Daisy.

1745
02:33:34,455 --> 02:33:35,956
I’m Benjamin.

1746
02:33:41,629 --> 02:33:44,339
It’s nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1747
02:33:46,009 --> 02:33:51,430
Would you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

1748
02:33:55,268 --> 02:33:56,810
Do I know you?

1749
02:34:01,733 --> 02:34:03,400
-I want some breakfast.
-And every day,

1750
02:34:03,484 --> 02:34:07,446
I would stop by to make sure
that he was comfortable.

1751
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:10,198
-No, I didn't.
-You just finished eating.

1752
02:34:10,283 --> 02:34:12,618
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing!

1753
02:34:12,702 --> 02:34:15,454
You're all fucking liars!

1754
02:34:15,538 --> 02:34:18,498
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

1755
02:34:19,792 --> 02:34:23,420
Now, why don't we see

1756
02:34:23,504 --> 02:34:26,924
if we can't find something else
for you to do?

1757
02:34:27,050 --> 02:34:30,260
I have a feeling
there's a lot of things I can't remember.

1758
02:34:30,345 --> 02:34:32,262
Well, like what, sugar?

1759
02:34:33,514 --> 02:34:37,517
It’s like there's this whole life I had,

1760
02:34:38,978 --> 02:34:41,396
and I can't remember what it was.

1761
02:34:44,192 --> 02:34:45,525
It’s okay.

1762
02:34:47,612 --> 02:34:49,112
It’s okay to forget things.

1763
02:34:49,322 --> 02:34:54,910
Many times, he would simply forget
who or where he was.

1764
02:34:55,203 --> 02:34:56,912
There he is, he's up there on the roof.

1765
02:34:56,996 --> 02:34:58,705
It wasn't easy.

1766
02:34:58,790 --> 02:35:01,041
-Benjamin!
-I can see everything!

1767
02:35:01,125 --> 02:35:02,918
-I can see the big river!
-That's right,

1768
02:35:03,002 --> 02:35:04,753
you can see everything, sweetheart.

1769
02:35:04,837 --> 02:35:06,838
I can see the graveyard
where Mama's buried,

1770
02:35:06,923 --> 02:35:10,300
-and all those other people.
-I want you to come down!

1771
02:35:10,385 --> 02:35:14,179
-What if I could fly?
-I knew a man who could fly.

1772
02:35:15,139 --> 02:35:18,141
You come down
and I’ll telic you all about him.

1773
02:35:21,688 --> 02:35:23,313
Somebody go up there.

1774
02:35:29,904 --> 02:35:32,864
He was five when I moved in.

1775
02:35:32,949 --> 02:35:37,452
Nearly the same age I was
when I had met him.

1776
02:35:43,418 --> 02:35:47,379
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1777
02:35:47,463 --> 02:35:49,923
"at 5:00 in the afternoon

1778
02:35:50,008 --> 02:35:53,510
"when he had got
his beautiful hind legs."

1779
02:35:54,721 --> 02:35:56,013
The days passed.

1780
02:35:56,097 --> 02:36:00,392
And I watched as he forgot how to walk

1781
02:36:05,606 --> 02:36:08,066
-and how to talk.
-What's my name?

1782
02:36:08,484 --> 02:36:09,860
I’m Daisy.

1783
02:36:10,987 --> 02:36:12,779
Can you say "Daisy"?

1784
02:36:14,323 --> 02:36:19,619
In 2002, they put up a new clock
in that train station.

1785
02:36:26,461 --> 02:36:30,255
And in the spring of 2003,

1786
02:36:34,594 --> 02:36:36,303
he looked at me

1787
02:36:38,765 --> 02:36:43,852
and I knew that he knew who I was.

1788
02:36:47,356 --> 02:36:53,195
And then he closed his eyes
as if to go to sleep.

1789
02:37:25,728 --> 02:37:29,940
-I wish I’d known him.
-Now you do.

1790
02:37:34,403 --> 02:37:38,198
Mom, I think I should go see
what's going on.

1791
02:37:45,206 --> 02:37:47,290
Good night, Benjamin.

1792
02:38:09,647 --> 02:38:12,023
We're expecting flash flooding
after the levee break.

1793
02:38:12,108 --> 02:38:14,401
It occurred in the Ninth Ward.

1794
02:38:17,405 --> 02:38:20,240
Some people are born to sit by a river.

1795
02:38:21,742 --> 02:38:23,743
Some get struck by lightning.

1796
02:38:25,580 --> 02:38:27,747
Some have an ear for music.

1797
02:38:29,292 --> 02:38:30,959
Some are artists.

1798
02:38:32,253 --> 02:38:33,628
Some swim.

1799
02:38:35,047 --> 02:38:36,715
Some know buttons.

1800
02:38:38,467 --> 02:38:39,885
Some know Shakespeare.

1801
02:38:41,012 --> 02:38:42,804
Some are mothers.
