2
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:22,125
Bring him here.

3
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,671
In the time of our ancestors

4
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,467
the cycle of our people lay in the
hands of the children.

5
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:34,637
A child's position in the tribe
was left to the maker.

6
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,851
Children bearing marks were brought
before the elders.

7
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,853
There, they were given titles...

8
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:45,148
...titles that would last a lifetime.

9
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:51,070
Wisdom...

10
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,825
courage...

11
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:00,538
vision.

12
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,087
This boy holds the holy marks

13
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:11,174
of our ancestors.

14
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:15,053
He is a leader.

15
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:19,015
He is a prophet.

16
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,852
We should listen to him.

17
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,898
We should listen to him.

18
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:02,475
I see you!

19
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:19,701
Nat?

20
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,705
Nat!

21
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,583
All right, you win again.

22
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,085
Come on out!

23
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:42,098
Sam? You come on in here
for supper!

24
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,933
Yessum.

25
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:45,476
Bye, Nat.

26
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:46,978
Bye.

27
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,673
You so much
as bat an eye,

28
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,217
I'm gonna blow you
from here to Hell.

29
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:42,927
What you doin' out here, boy?

30
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,014
Pickin' up some food
for my master,

31
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:47,432
Benjamin Turner.

32
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,393
In the middle of the night?
Turn around.

33
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:57,442
Where your pass at?

34
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:02,071
Bring it on. C'mon! Bring it!

35
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,616
Get back.

36
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,454
You think you're smarter
than me, don't you, boy?

37
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,664
No, sir.

38
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,166
Jesse, who do we call a nigger

39
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:15,668
who done think
he can outsmart a white man?

40
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,503
A dead nigger.

41
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,297
Turn around.

42
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,260
On your knees.

43
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:30,433
You done this
to yourself, boy.

44
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:49,994
What happened?

45
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,120
Go on to bed.

46
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,914
I got caught stealing food.

47
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:56,626
I killed a slave catcher.
I gotta go.

48
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,338
You take care of your mom
and Nana, you hear?

49
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:01,589
You a child of God.

50
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:04,509
You got purpose. It's in you.

51
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:06,427
The Lord put it there,

52
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:09,263
and there ain't nothing nobody
can do to take it away.

53
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:10,598
You hear?

54
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:11,933
Yes, sir.

55
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,727
Now you go ahead on
and go to bed.

56
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,439
I'll be back for y'all
as soon as I can.

57
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:30,535
Go on back to bed.
Go on to bed, girl! We sleep!

58
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,347
Bridget! Nancy! Y'all wake up!

59
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,516
Isaac's in a lot of trouble.

60
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,978
I need one of y'all
to tell me where he is.

61
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,814
Don't know where he is, massa.
We ain't seen him all night.

62
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,023
You sure?

63
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:03,985
Ben, I'm gonna
ask you to leave.

64
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,194
Huh?

65
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:07,613
A white man
has lost his life tonight.

66
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:10,199
You know like I do
what that mean. Get!

67
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,285
Now, any harm done
to these people,

68
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,078
I'm gonna call the sheriff!
I'm serious!

69
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,003
None of y'all know
where he is, huh?

70
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,213
No, sir.

71
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:29,177
Goddamnit.

72
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,223
What about you, boy?

73
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:35,507
He don't know nothing, either.

74
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:50,990
Where's your daddy at?

75
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,830
Now listen, you don't tell me
where he's at...

76
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,624
someone else
is gonna find him,

77
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,375
and they gonna kill him.

78
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:07,215
You tell me, I'll go get him.
I'll bring him back here safe.

79
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,341
All right?

80
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,304
Tell me where daddy's at.

81
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:18,893
Say it. Spit something
outta that mouth! Say it!

82
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:21,938
Tell me where he's at!

83
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,984
Goddamnit.

84
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,697
You that nigger's boy,
all right.

85
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,866
If I find out
y'all's been lying...

86
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:38,120
I'm gonna come back here,
I ain't gonna be so nice...

87
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,165
Oh, massa, please! Please!
Massa, please! Oh, Lord!

88
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,209
All right, that's...
That's enough! Stop!

89
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:47,088
You best teach
that boy some manners.

90
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,756
Next time he look me
in the eye,

91
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,093
you gonna get the same thing
what waitin' for his pa.

92
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,906
Mind if I help you?

93
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,492
No, ma'am.

94
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,494
Samuel told me
something this morning

95
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,037
I wanted to ask you about.

96
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:25,668
He said...
Nat knows how to read.

97
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,045
Nat don't not know
how to read.

98
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,132
Part of me
couldn't believe it myself.

99
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,926
So I tested him.

100
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,305
Sure enough...

101
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,933
there he was
sounding out letters.

102
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:44,687
You have him come by the house
tomorrow after lunch.

103
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,647
He don't mean no harm.

104
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,733
I'ma whip him good
the next time I see him.

105
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:52,528
Whip him? Nonsense.

106
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,948
I'm gonna teach him.

107
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:59,952
If the good Lord gave that boy
a gift to read...

108
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:02,705
we'd be remiss
to let it go to waste.

109
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:06,334
And don't expect him back
anytime soon.

110
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,961
He'll be living with us
in the main house for a while.

111
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,757
Lessons best not be disturbed
in the beginning.

112
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,759
Yes, ma'am.

113
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,573
It's okay, baby.
It's okay. It ain't real.

114
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:41,577
It ain't real. It's all right.
It's in your mind.

115
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,704
It's in your mind.

116
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:46,207
Momma's here now.

117
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,212
Want my poppa.

118
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,007
Me too, baby.

119
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,427
Me too.

120
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,598
Put your arms through.

121
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,229
How handsome.

122
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,829
He'll be all right.

123
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,903
These books are
for white folks.

124
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:02,366
They're full of things
your kind wouldn't understand.

125
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,120
But I do have
a special one just for you.

126
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,205
And guess what?

127
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,249
It's the best book
ever written.

128
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,800
You're a special boy,
Nathaniel.

129
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,556
Study hard and heed
my instructions, hear?

130
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,933
Your life...

131
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:30,728
it'll never be the same.

132
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,271
I'll see to that.

133
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,814
Yes, missus.

134
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,947
"Genesis. In the beginning..."

135
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,158
In the beginning...

136
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,577
Here, this word here, "The."

137
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,830
That's tricky.
Now, these letters "T-H."

138
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,373
<i>Whenever you see them...</i>

139
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:54,418
"...cleanse your hands,
ye sinners...

140
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:58,422
"and purify your hearts,
ye double-minded.

141
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,301
"Be afflicted, and mourn,
and weep.

142
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,180
"Let your laughter
be turned to mourning...

143
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,808
"and your joy to heaviness."

144
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:14,772
James 4, Chapter 8 and 9.

145
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:32,957
Turn with me, if you would,
to James 1.

146
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:37,711
Holding on to the goodness
of the Lord.

147
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,133
I spoke to Ben

148
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:45,970
before he went on
to be with the Lord.

149
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:53,477
He felt you'd be more useful
to our family as a field hand.

150
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,652
I'm sorry, Nat.

151
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,172
Now, you gonna start here,

152
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,508
and you're gonna work your way
down yonder.

153
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,677
And I'll be right over here.
You hear?

154
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,359
Ah!

155
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,328
Thank you, brother.

156
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:46,757
I had fainted, unless I had
believed to see...

157
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,134
the goodness of the Lord...

158
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:52,096
in the land of the living.

159
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,767
Wait on the Lord...

160
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,644
be of good courage,

161
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,355
and He shall strengthen
thine heart.

162
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,360
Wait, I say...

163
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,612
on the Lord.

164
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:13,617
Let us bow our heads.

165
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,376
Sam, that sister of yours...

166
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,962
gonna make a fine wife indeed.

167
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,715
It's been a true blessing

168
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,802
seeing her develop
into the woman that she is.

169
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,303
It'd be
an even better blessing

170
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,471
seein' her and Momma...

171
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,808
put their feet under his table
instead of mine.

172
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,655
I gotta say...

173
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,200
Sam, your slaves sure do know
how to behave.

174
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,828
I'm impressed with them
every time I come around.

175
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,414
Well, they God fearin'.
One of them's a preacher.

176
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:01,749
No one's gotta tell you

177
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,209
the times are tough
with the drought.

178
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,671
It's gettin' harder for
the whites in this county...

179
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,424
to clothe
and feed their niggers good.

180
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:14,845
Talks of insurrection
got folks scared.

181
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,640
I think people might pay
good money

182
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:21,018
to have them calm down a bit.

183
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,854
Especially by
one of their own.

184
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,866
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

185
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,536
You seen a nigger
run past here?

186
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,248
Naw. Then again
I doze off for a few.

187
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,708
What about you, boy?

188
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:48,712
Best not lie now.
I know when y'all's lyin'.

189
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:51,048
No, sir.

190
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,549
Couple of niggers went missin'

191
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,068
off Bill Johnson's place
this mornin'.

192
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,552
Say they raised up
on an overseer

193
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,471
before they took off.

194
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:00,891
All right, you see somethin'
let us know.

195
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,226
Will do.

196
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:03,560
Giddyup.

197
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,821
You finish up here,
I'll go square up inside.

198
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,405
Yes, sir.

199
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:29,837
Ma'am. The youngin',
he dropped this a step back.

200
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,506
Thank ya.

201
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,637
Whatcha think you're doin'?

202
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,721
He was just tryin'...

203
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,431
You spoke to my wife.

204
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,393
Where's your owner, boy?

205
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,062
I asked you a question.

206
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,529
You best goin' to put
that stick down now!

207
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,699
I want the Sheriff.
This boy assaulted me!

208
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,117
He assaulted my wife!

209
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,451
And I'm bringin' charges!

210
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:02,619
Sheriff Floyd?

211
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,413
All right, you fetch him
if you like.

212
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:05,932
But in the meantime
I will give you

213
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,796
to the count of three
to put your stick down...

214
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,102
before I give you
some real charges

215
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,326
to give him when he gets here.

216
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,628
You threatnin' me?

217
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:12,963
One.

218
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,757
Two.

219
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,136
C'mon, get the boy.

220
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,138
Let's get home.

221
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,782
We got sweet corn!

222
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,242
C'mon now!
Get your grits!

223
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,577
We got sweet corn here.

224
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,829
Here you go.

225
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,748
And this one here!

226
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,499
Strong as an ox!

227
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,668
Nothin' but good seed flowin'
from this here buck.

228
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,339
Look at them teeth. Huh?
I'll start him out at...

229
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,341
200.

230
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,343
150?

231
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,803
C'mon now, I gotta
make a living here, gents.

232
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,598
100? 75?

233
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,184
Sold! Get outta here.

234
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,811
Put a yoke on him.
Bring her up here.

235
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:16,026
Now, consider
this comely wench.

236
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,280
Not a day over 18.

237
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,866
All right,
I'll start her off at 175.

238
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:26,203
I got 175. Do I hear two?

239
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:30,207
Now we're talkin'!
Do I got 225?

240
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,851
Massa, that wench there
sure would make

241
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,353
a good weddin' gift
for Miss Catherine.

242
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:34,461
225!

243
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:35,784
You keep sayin'
she been askin'.

244
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,047
Do I hear 250?

245
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,674
She looks right young,
if you ask me.

246
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:39,883
C'mon now.

247
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,608
- You right, sir, she young.
- Gimme 250.

248
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:44,137
C'mon.
But with the right teacher,

249
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,222
a wench like that?

250
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,473
250.

251
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,800
Could be workin' a long time.

252
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:50,227
There it is! 275?

253
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,077
Massa, sure would be
a shame to watch her

254
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,398
go to waste
for such a low price.

255
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:55,875
And what the hell
would you know about

256
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,402
what's a little
and what's a lot, huh?

257
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,654
I don't know
what's gotten into you lately,

258
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,137
but whatever it is,
you better quit.

259
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,408
Are you seein'
what I'm seein'?

260
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:09,746
You take this one home,
you know, clean her up...

261
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,416
won't be long
before you find yourself

262
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,584
happier than a dog
with three balls!

263
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,254
Smile, bitch.

264
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:20,257
That's 250 goin' once.

265
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:24,428
250 goin' twice.

266
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,722
275.

267
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,433
We got 275!

268
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,019
275 goin' once.

269
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:35,689
275 goin' twice.

270
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:40,694
Sold to that fine gentleman
in the back!

271
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,908
Whoa.

272
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,913
She be fine, sir.

273
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:54,124
I sure hope you're right.

274
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:57,044
Have your momma
get her cleaned and fed.

275
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,128
Start breakin' her in.

276
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,212
Yes, sir.

277
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:00,896
You and Hark
can start on the north fence

278
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,300
first thing in the morning.
Yes, sir.

279
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,724
I ain't gonna hurt you.

280
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,310
Just gonna climb up
and help you out.

281
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,941
It's all right.

282
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,093
Who is this child?
What happened?

283
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,469
Burnin' up.

284
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:51,431
This mine! This my dress!
My dress! This my dress!

285
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,682
Go now! Get out, ya!

286
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,978
We're not gonna hurt you.
We're not gonna hurt you.

287
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,188
Don't take it away.

288
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,682
You just smile

289
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,559
and let them do the talkin'.
All right?

290
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,394
Yessum.

291
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:48,196
Afternoon, massa.
This here Cherry-Ann.

292
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:49,531
Massa.

293
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,825
Catherine!

294
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,413
Catherine, this here
is Cherry-Ann.

295
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,747
Missus.

296
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,419
Oh, thank you!

297
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,840
Come on,
I want you to meet Momma.

298
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,846
Momma.

299
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,265
Thank you.

300
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:16,600
For what?

301
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:21,688
For gettin' her better.
For makin' her so beautiful.

302
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:24,065
I didn't do nothin'.

303
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,026
That girl was
brought into this world

304
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,069
as beautiful as she could be.

305
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:40,874
It sure is sad to see you
and the missus go.

306
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,626
We'll be just down the road.

307
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,936
When we get
all good and settled,

308
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,086
we'll come back and visit.

309
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,255
On Sundays for church
and that.

310
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,049
Well, there's no rush.

311
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,217
Oh.

312
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,468
I'm foolin'. Come here.

313
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:52,886
If y'all need anything,

314
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:56,097
or he ain't treatin'
you right, you let me know.

315
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,058
Yes, big brother. I love you.

316
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,976
Love you, too.

317
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,645
Momma, you ready?

318
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,735
I'm worried about you, Sam.

319
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,488
This a big place to be
out here all by yourself.

320
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,657
I'll be fine.

321
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,497
You take care now.

322
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:22,499
All right.
Hmm.

323
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,925
Massa.
For the horses.

324
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,261
Just one.

325
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:35,679
Yes, sir.

326
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,478
Hi.

327
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,689
Hi.

328
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:49,859
I'm Nat.

329
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,444
I know.

330
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,156
Sorry for...

331
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,701
fightin' you.

332
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,120
Oh, that's fine.

333
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,832
Um...

334
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,467
They're pretty.

335
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:18,054
Found them 'round here.

336
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,181
Thank you.

337
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,193
Bye.

338
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,930
<i>You got
a right, you got a right</i>

339
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,183
<i>You got a right,
you got a right</i>

340
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,226
<i>You got a right
to the Tree of Life</i>

341
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,437
<i>You got a right
to the Tree of Life</i>

342
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,564
<i>You got a right,
you got a right</i>

343
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,441
<i>You got a right,
you got a right</i>

344
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,610
<i>You gotta right
to the Tree of Life</i>

345
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,737
<i>You gotta right
to the Tree of Life</i>

346
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,864
<i>- Hold on!
- Hold on!</i>

347
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,783
<i>- Hold on!
- Hold on!</i>

348
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:20,950
<i>Hold on!</i>

349
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:22,117
<i>Hold on!</i>

350
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,161
<i>Hold on!</i>

351
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,244
<i>Hold on!</i>

352
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:26,289
<i>- Hold on!
- Hold on!</i>

353
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:30,627
<i>Okay, hold on!
Oh yeah, hold on!</i>

354
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,966
Just as the planted crop

355
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,635
is harvested
in its own time...

356
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,888
so too has the Lord
planted us.

357
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,147
Good Lord.

358
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,819
The good Lord,
the good Lord...

359
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:59,656
will finish His work in us.

360
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:09,082
So, in closing, I urge you all
to take heart...

361
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,000
for God is at work
in your life,

362
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,753
and He will not stop until
his job is done. Amen?

363
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,463
Amen.
Dismissed!

364
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:23,263
It seems like
it's been forever

365
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:25,306
since I last seen you.

366
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,685
There were a few miles
between us.

367
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,105
Just feels like so many more.

368
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,525
How is it there?

369
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:40,822
It's fine. Not like
what I come from 'fore here.

370
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,200
Most days I'm just tending
to Miss Elizabeth

371
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,870
or fetching this-that
for Miss Catherine.

372
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:53,334
You know if y'all coming back
next week for church?

373
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,378
I know as much as you.

374
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,505
I suppose if missus
is suggesting it...

375
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,133
Master Reese
don't mind the trip.

376
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:05,180
I sure wouldn't wanna wait
another season to see ya.

377
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,141
Me, neither.

378
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:24,157
My Nana got it
from my grandaddy.

379
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:28,036
She brought it with her when
she was taken from Africa.

380
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,415
Said it was the only thing
that kept her mind free.

381
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,752
It's pretty.

382
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,550
I want you to have it.

383
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:49,390
In case I don't see you
for a while, you...

384
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,936
have something
that reminds you of me.

385
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,610
I don't know if it's right
I take it.

386
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:03,446
'Sides, I don't have
nothing to give you

387
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,406
to remind you of me.

388
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:10,787
I spend all my time
thinkin' about you already.

389
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:14,791
Cherry?

390
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,709
Come help with Momma.
It's time to go.

391
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,243
Who there?

392
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,253
Nat?

393
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,676
What are you doin'?

394
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,271
I shoulda done that earlier.

395
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,400
You came here to kiss me?

396
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:13,493
No, no, no.

397
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:18,665
I ain't got much.

398
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:23,086
My faith, Momma, Nana.

399
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:26,297
Up until now, enough.

400
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,843
Cherry, I'd feel right honored
if you'd be my wife.

401
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:36,307
I'd treat ya right.
Protect ya with my life.

402
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:38,309
If you'd have me.

403
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,439
Yes. Yes, I will.

404
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,331
What now?

405
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,416
Uh...

406
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,918
I talk it over with Samuel.

407
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,921
Get us a cabin set up
when y'all visit.

408
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,757
All right.

409
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:30,570
<i>Heavenly Father.
We are gathered here today...</i>

410
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:32,864
to join together
these two children,

411
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:36,159
who have found the love
that exists in You.

412
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:39,746
The love that surrounds
all of us all the time.

413
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:43,583
We bless these children
together with our hands...

414
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,961
that the love that flows
through our hands...

415
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:14,781
Well, hello, Reverend.

416
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:16,574
I wasn't expecting
to see you around

417
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:17,784
these parts 'till Sunday.

418
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:19,792
What brings you around
the middle of the week?

419
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,746
Never a wrong time...

420
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:24,081
to bring a blessing
to a brother in Christ.

421
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,458
Oh Lord.

422
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,210
Is this blessing
gonna cost me money?

423
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:31,214
Not a penny.
To the contrary, in fact.

424
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:33,549
Isaiah, run us out a water.

425
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:36,010
Gin, if you please.

426
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,055
So, I put the word out
about your preacher.

427
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,103
Got a couple of farmers
willing to turn a good coin.

428
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,939
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

429
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:51,359
Every bit counts these days.

430
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:53,236
Oh.

431
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:00,660
Ah!

432
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,411
Mmm.

433
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:05,540
If your boy
does to their liking,

434
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:06,958
you could get outta debt.

435
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,168
Save your farm.

436
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,590
And all I gotta do
is let Nat preach.

437
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,509
That's it.

438
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:20,388
Now, I'm not vouching for
the character of these fellas.

439
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:23,558
What business
they runnin' or how.

440
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:24,767
I'm just here to tell you

441
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,435
that there's
an opportunity there.

442
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:29,355
One you got the means
to capitalize on.

443
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,523
Whereabouts we talkin'?

444
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:32,650
In Southampton, at the start.

445
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:35,611
Well, sounds good enough.

446
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,113
I'll send you the details.

447
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,450
Names, locations, and dates,
I'd say by tomorrow.

448
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:43,286
You already booked the dates.

449
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,079
I figured you'd say yes.

450
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,748
What's in it for you?

451
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:51,961
The pure joy of knowing
that I'm helping a brother.

452
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,254
And, uh...

453
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:54,380
Oh, here it comes.

454
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:58,342
Well, if I was to receive
a gift offering...

455
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:00,845
I certainly wouldn't object.

456
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:03,139
You are caution, Reverend.

457
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,976
I am but a servant.

458
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:17,486
Here's some salt pork
and some tomatoes

459
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:18,779
for when you get hungry.

460
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,990
Thank you, Momma.

461
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:24,535
Don't y'all go
getting' worried now.

462
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,287
I'll be back directly.

463
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:27,997
I know.

464
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:31,542
Pray the Lord
brings you back safe.

465
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,209
You Massa Turner's nigger?

466
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,044
I'm Nat.

467
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,047
Massa Turner's in here.

468
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:24,929
Come on.

469
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,688
- We're here?
- Yes, sir.

470
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,236
Sam Turner.

471
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:43,114
Made it right on time.
Joseph Randall.

472
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:48,119
This here's Abner.
This little one? Jasper.

473
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,871
This the preacher?
Yes, sir.

474
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,456
Nat?

475
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:54,083
Evening, sir.

476
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,168
He's a little young, ain't he?

477
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:57,628
Why, he's old enough.

478
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,838
You've been studying
the Word awhile, haven't you?

479
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:02,675
Studyin'?

480
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:06,262
I can barely train my niggers
to learn their own names.

481
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:08,264
Come on!

482
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:16,564
<i>It's hard times</i>

483
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,607
<i>for small farmers
like you and myself.</i>

484
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:19,936
Breakin' even's hard enough,

485
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:21,652
but getting ahead's
impossible.

486
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,029
So to save some,

487
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,406
I cut them back to a meal
a day per head now.

488
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:27,533
A few of them
started getting' fidgety,

489
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:28,993
so I had Abner
come down on 'em.

490
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:32,955
Abner, here...
he's my only real protection.

491
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,833
Now, they needs to mind me.
You speak on that.

492
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,919
They treasure in Heaven
from submittin' and all.

493
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:42,256
If they gets
to moanin' or carryin' on,

494
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,674
you don't pay 'em no mind...

495
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,384
because they lazy as all hell.

496
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:47,928
They do anything
to get outta work.

497
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:49,680
You ready, boy?

498
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:06,947
Listen up!
Got a preacher here tonight.

499
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:09,158
Come here, boy.

500
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,329
Now, he's a nigger here
like y'all...

501
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,956
and he's here to talk to you
about the Lord.

502
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:17,708
So you listen to him

503
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:22,338
and you might just make it
into Heaven, you hear?

504
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:56,205
Brothers and sisters.

505
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:06,215
I lead you to... Peter 2:18.

506
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:12,763
"Slaves, submit yourselves...

507
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:16,559
"to your masters
with all respect."

508
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:21,230
"Not only to those who are
good and considerate...

509
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:27,570
"but also to those...
who are harsh."

510
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,038
You sure you don't wanna
stay the night?

511
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:39,707
Got some fine brandy

512
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,418
and a couple of choice wenches
in the cellar.

513
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:45,588
Get Abner here to strike out
the fiddle and...

514
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:48,924
sit around the fire,
tell some old lies, huh?

515
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,594
No. We best be gettin' back
before sun go down.

516
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:54,805
All right. Suit yourself.

517
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,473
Would take
a bottle of that brandy,

518
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,600
if you could spare it.

519
00:41:57,808 --> 00:42:00,603
Oh, sure thing. Abner?

520
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,771
I got a chocolate one here

521
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:05,649
that does it right every time.

522
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,819
You sure you don't wanna stay?

523
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:11,447
No, they expectin'
us back. You know how it is.

524
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:13,616
All right.

525
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,287
You's a smart man, Sam.

526
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,915
Man make a fortune
with that boy.

527
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,381
Great doin' business with you.

528
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:35,304
Let's go.

529
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,661
You all right?

530
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:02,331
Yeah.

531
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:10,130
The dress there.

532
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:13,133
That the one you were
wearing that day?

533
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:16,845
Yes.

534
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:19,682
Momma offered you one of hers?

535
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:22,351
She did.

536
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,912
"Abigail Hayne."

537
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:44,164
My momma.

538
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:50,713
"Madison Hayne." Who was that?

539
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,173
That's me.

540
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,176
My momma...

541
00:43:57,177 --> 00:44:00,180
she put this dress on me...

542
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:03,183
the day they took me from her.

543
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:07,187
Showed me this here patch.

544
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:11,191
Told me to never forget
who I was...

545
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,944
and that I had a momma.

546
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:17,406
And that she was somewhere...

547
00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:21,577
missing me and loving me.

548
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:25,539
I was 13.

549
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:35,215
I can call ya
Madison, if ya like.

550
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:38,427
You can call me
whatever you want.

551
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:41,597
I'll call you Queen.

552
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,436
What's wrong?

553
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:52,316
We're gonna have a baby.

554
00:44:54,777 --> 00:44:56,779
A baby?

555
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:02,451
You sure?

556
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,460
You mad?

557
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:14,463
Mad?

558
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:16,840
No. No.

559
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:20,469
I ain't mad.

560
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:40,697
"...as the eyes
of the servants

561
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:43,033
look unto the hand
of their masters...

562
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:44,368
"and the eyes of a maid

563
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:46,662
"look unto the hand
of her mistress..."

564
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,799
"...and Noah
awoke from his wine

565
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:00,509
"and knew

566
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:01,844
"had done unto him.

"God of Shem, and Canaan..."

571
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:52,227
Wait here.

572
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:08,076
I'll go check 'round back.

573
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:09,786
Yessum.

574
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,143
Whatcha doin' on my land?

575
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,770
Hey! Call off your dog!

576
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:35,979
Whatcha doin' on my land?

577
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,689
No! He's with me!

578
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:40,526
Who the hell are you?

579
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:43,195
I'm Samuel Turner.
Reverend WALTHALL sent us.

580
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:45,781
Fella with
the nigger preacher.

581
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:48,617
Come on!

582
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:51,286
Let's go find Earl.

583
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,833
You all right? Come on.

584
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:59,294
Niggers is niggers here.

585
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,839
Now, we don't treat none
no different than another.

586
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:05,050
We got rules.

587
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,511
Cost of breakin' 'em,
stealin', sassin'...

588
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,513
or any other thing
that Earl and I think

589
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:12,307
worth dealin' with,
will be paid for in skin.

590
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:15,060
You interfere with that...

591
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,521
we'll shoot you
where you stand.

592
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:18,981
Got any problem with that,

593
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:22,150
you can stop right now and go
on back where you came from.

594
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:29,241
Come on now! Come on!

595
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:31,994
Earl!

596
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:34,037
This here is Sam Turner,

597
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:35,831
fella with
the nigger preacher.

598
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,045
Where you say you come from?

599
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,339
We from here.
Southampton County.

600
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:45,674
Just south of Nottoway.

601
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:46,883
Mmm.

602
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:48,969
Lotta Yankees makin' their way
down that way.

603
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:51,680
Rabble-rousin', stirring shit
on our way of life.

604
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,975
They're pullin'
that same shit.

605
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:57,686
Earl. Got a little problem.

606
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,370
Which one?

607
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:17,414
This one.

608
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:19,082
How long?

609
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,960
Mmm. About a day or so.

610
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:28,050
You ain't gonna eat, hmm?

611
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:33,722
You gonna eat? Come on.
You ain't gonna eat?

612
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:35,766
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

613
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:38,143
All right.

614
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:41,396
If it ain't one thing,
it's another.

615
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:04,586
You wonderin' why we could
use that nigger of yours?

616
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,506
You're seein' it firsthand.
All right, get his mouth open.

617
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:11,093
Well, if it ain't the Yanks...

618
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:13,845
it's the drought.

619
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:16,014
If not the drought...

620
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:20,102
it's goddamn mutiny.

621
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:26,191
Get a funnel in there.

622
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,795
Truth is,
even the meanest nigger's

623
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,839
fearful of the Gospel.

624
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:52,217
Maybe a good word
from your boy there...

625
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:55,887
discipline word, go a lot
further than my pistol would.

626
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:58,765
Nat's a... good preacher.

627
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:01,810
I don't right care
how good he is...

628
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:04,646
long as he say
what he's supposed to.

629
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:33,675
Brethren.

630
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:40,515
I pray you sing to the Lord...

631
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:44,227
a new song.

632
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:52,944
Sing praise in assembly
of the righteous.

633
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:57,282
Let the saints be joyful
in glory.

634
00:51:57,783 --> 00:52:00,535
Let them sing aloud
on their beds.

635
00:52:00,702 --> 00:52:01,745
Let the high praise of God

636
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,205
be on the mouths
of the saints...

637
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:04,956
and a two-edge sword
in their hand

638
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,459
to execute vengeance
on the demonic nations...

639
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,211
and punishment
on those peoples

640
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:10,962
to bind their kings
with chains...

641
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:13,423
and their nobles
with fetters of iron

642
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,550
to execute on them
this written judgment.

643
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:17,636
This honor hath
all his saints!

644
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:18,804
Praise the Lord!

645
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:23,058
Praise the Lord!
Sing to him a new song!

646
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:27,270
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!

647
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:58,134
Don't suppose
you got a pass anywhere

648
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,345
underneath that pretty dress.

649
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:02,389
No, sir.

650
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:05,267
I belongs to Massa Guiles
and this here his property.

651
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,102
You sassin' me, girl?

652
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:09,062
No, sir.

653
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:11,314
Anybody that knows nothin'
knows that state law says...

654
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:14,359
that if a nigger's less than
10 paces from a tree line...

655
00:53:14,693 --> 00:53:15,819
that nigger need a pass.

656
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:20,615
Well, sir, I can get one.

657
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:23,285
You ain't goin' nowhere.

658
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:25,620
Either you gonna
show me a pass,

659
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:27,706
or you gonna show me
somethin' else.

660
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:33,961
What?

661
00:53:34,004 --> 00:53:35,380
I'm sorry
to disturb ya,

662
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:37,382
but Nat's gotta talk to you.

663
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,634
Somethin' awful had happened.

664
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:40,921
Whatever it is,
just tell him

665
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:42,637
I'll get to it in the mornin'.

666
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:45,640
Massa, if you could
just see Nat

667
00:53:45,724 --> 00:53:47,017
for just a moment, I...

668
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,644
Goddamnit, Isaiah.

669
00:53:52,022 --> 00:53:54,482
All right, tell him I'll meet
him on the front porch.

670
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:56,818
I'm right here, sir.

671
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:59,237
Might as well come in then.

672
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:04,659
Sir, I am awfully sorry
about all this. I...

673
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,244
What is it, Nat?

674
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:09,539
Cherry... she's been hurt
real bad.

675
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:11,833
Whatcha mean hurt?

676
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:15,086
A group of men... sir.

677
00:54:19,174 --> 00:54:20,550
Isaiah, fetch me some paper.

678
00:54:20,717 --> 00:54:22,052
Yeah.

679
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:26,848
All right,
you should go down there.

680
00:54:27,057 --> 00:54:29,684
Take Jupiter,
but don't start no trouble.

681
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:32,729
Stay the night, come back
first thing in the morning.

682
00:54:32,938 --> 00:54:36,358
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

683
00:54:57,462 --> 00:54:59,798
God's gonna punish
whoever did this.

684
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:02,717
Monsters.

685
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,780
Nat?

686
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:07,323
I'm right here.

687
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:09,325
I'm right here.

688
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:14,122
It's me now.

689
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,875
I'm right here.

690
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:21,546
I'm sorry.

691
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:25,550
No, no. You don't apologize.

692
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:28,344
You don't owe that to nobody.

693
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:35,810
You need to tell me
who done this to you.

694
00:56:35,977 --> 00:56:38,354
'Cause I'm gonna
take care of it, you hear?

695
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:40,815
On my soul.

696
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,988
I need you to tell me now.

697
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:18,019
"Put up again
thy sword into His place.

698
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:23,608
"For all they
that take the sword...

699
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:27,403
"shall pass with the sword."

700
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:32,408
You taught me that.

701
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:40,625
I need you here.

702
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,045
Joanna, too.

703
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:49,634
Leave this to the Lord.

704
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,485
You wanted
to see me, sir?

705
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:13,867
Yeah. How's Cherry?

706
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:15,910
I'm believin' she'll be fine.

707
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:17,996
Good. Good.

708
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:21,749
Not many woulda
let you go like I did.

709
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:25,044
Thank you, sir.
Mmm.

710
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:27,481
We're having
a big get-together tonight

711
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:29,257
with a lot of very
important people.

712
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:32,343
Kind of like
when Daddy was alive.

713
00:58:32,427 --> 00:58:33,428
So I'm gonna need you

714
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:34,738
and a couple of others
in the house.

715
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:36,264
Anyone who's had experience

716
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:38,725
servin' and being
respectable help.

717
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:41,102
Yes, sir.

718
00:58:41,186 --> 00:58:43,688
Can't tell ya how important
this is for all of us.

719
00:58:43,897 --> 00:58:44,939
If we get this right,

720
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:47,275
the Turner name
will mean something again.

721
00:58:50,445 --> 00:58:52,197
Isaiah.

722
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:55,450
Yes, sir.

723
00:59:45,959 --> 00:59:47,919
As you all know,
this annual dinner

724
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:50,129
was a tradition
of our daddy many years ago.

725
00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:53,341
And for all he believed,
he placed family, faith,

726
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:55,468
and tradition at the top
of his priority list.

727
00:59:55,677 --> 00:59:57,011
Twenty years later,

728
00:59:57,136 --> 00:59:59,806
those same priorities have
kept this property afloat.

729
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:02,100
That and the cash down
from your colored preacher.

730
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:05,103
Yeah!
That, too.

731
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:07,522
May God continue
to bless all of us

732
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:09,148
for many generations to come.

733
01:00:09,774 --> 01:00:12,151
Hear, hear.

734
01:00:12,986 --> 01:00:14,696
Nat, would you please
lead us in prayer?

735
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,179
Reverend, I trust
you wouldn't mind.

736
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:18,783
I guess not.

737
01:00:29,794 --> 01:00:32,005
Heavenly Father.

738
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:35,883
We come to thank You
for Your word and Your will.

739
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:40,555
We pray for and thank You

740
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,808
for Your protection
and Your promise.

741
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:46,394
And in our obedience,

742
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:50,315
You will be an enemy
to our enemies.

743
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:54,402
That you will oppose those
who oppose us.

744
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:00,575
Continue to guide us,
O Lord...

745
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:03,411
and we will continue
to follow.

746
01:01:04,037 --> 01:01:06,414
Through fine tribulation
we will push forward...

747
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:10,835
recognizing only You
as our source and strength.

748
01:01:12,587 --> 01:01:15,590
In Your holy name we pray.

749
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,759
Amen.

750
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:18,843
Bon appétit.

751
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,096
Daddy always said,

752
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:24,599
"Three black peppercorns
in a glass of port...

753
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:28,061
"and you got yourself
a excellent digestif."

754
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:30,271
Well, black is always tasty.

755
01:01:30,438 --> 01:01:36,277
Especially a nice piece
of black meat. Sweet. Juicy.

756
01:01:38,363 --> 01:01:39,423
I ain't doin' it, all right?

757
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:41,007
Naw, naw.
I need you to get out of here!

758
01:01:41,074 --> 01:01:45,244
Ain't gonna happen, man.
You just come out here...

759
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:48,122
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ho, ho, ho!

760
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:50,208
What's goin' on, huh?

761
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:51,459
- I ain't doin' it.
- Huh?

762
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:53,294
- I ain't doin' it, Nat.
- Doin' what?

763
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:55,213
He'd have to lynch me first.

764
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:57,465
Lynch ya?
What are we talkin' about?

765
01:01:58,424 --> 01:02:01,636
One of Samuel's guests...

766
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:04,722
What?

767
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:10,978
One of Samuel's guests
requested Esther, and, uh...

768
01:02:17,902 --> 01:02:20,488
Just go and talk to Samuel.
Just tell him what happened.

769
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:22,424
Tell him what it was
and he'll straighten this out.

770
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:25,660
But Samuel sent me
over here personally, Nat.

771
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:29,914
I can't do it, Nat. I won't.

772
01:02:30,123 --> 01:02:31,666
Brother Hark...

773
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:33,334
But, what... Who are you?

774
01:02:33,418 --> 01:02:34,836
Brother Hark, do you think

775
01:02:34,919 --> 01:02:37,755
that I wanna
come over here for this?

776
01:02:38,256 --> 01:02:40,133
You here, ain't ya?

777
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,094
Nat!

778
01:02:45,263 --> 01:02:46,264
Where is she?

779
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:49,183
Samuel, sir.
Please, you can't do this.

780
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:54,605
Everything all right?

781
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:56,524
Oh, it's just fine.

782
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:58,317
I'll be inside directly.

783
01:02:58,484 --> 01:03:00,027
I hope you won't be alone.

784
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:03,948
I assure you, I will not be.

785
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:07,368
If you mess this up for me,
my hand to God...

786
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:09,620
I will lynch every one
of you come mornin!

787
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:11,456
Do you understand me?

788
01:03:13,374 --> 01:03:14,375
Fetch her.

789
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:15,543
Yes, sir.

790
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:15,603
It's okay.

791
01:04:30,618 --> 01:04:34,038
Where is He, Nat?
Where's God now?

792
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,634
Hark.

793
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:56,811
Excuse me.

794
01:04:57,645 --> 01:05:00,648
I'm looking for a preacher
named Nat.

795
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:02,960
He's been banned
from every church

796
01:05:02,984 --> 01:05:04,068
in the county for his sins.

797
01:05:04,277 --> 01:05:06,737
He's lucky that's all he got
for what he done.

798
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:09,657
The world has its way
with dealing with the immoral.

799
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:12,243
Above all those
who cast that immorality

800
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:14,495
on the children as he has.

801
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:18,291
But no one is without sin,
Miss Elizabeth.

802
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:21,669
And this man wants to repent
and be delivered.

803
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:26,507
As a Shepherd of the Lord,
it's my duty to serve.

804
01:05:26,674 --> 01:05:28,676
So...

805
01:05:29,677 --> 01:05:31,846
I'd like to baptize him.

806
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:33,514
The hell you will!

807
01:05:33,598 --> 01:05:34,932
Jethro, you will
mind your mouth.

808
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:36,350
With respect, Miss Elizabeth,

809
01:05:36,434 --> 01:05:39,103
a nigger can't baptize
no white man.

810
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:42,690
I just think we should wait
for Mr. Samuel to get back.

811
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,167
Jethro, go wait
in the front yard.

812
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,911
Mr. Samuel gets back,
he'll have both of us!

813
01:05:46,027 --> 01:05:48,321
I won't ask you again.

814
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:53,117
Boy, you gonna get it.

815
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:59,040
Are you sure
you want to do this, Nat?

816
01:05:59,123 --> 01:06:01,125
Samuel may not like it.

817
01:06:01,334 --> 01:06:03,377
Nor will a lot of other folks
around here.

818
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:07,131
Don't got
too much choice, missus.

819
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:10,551
This man still belongs to God.

820
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:13,888
When you stand between
the Lord and his people...

821
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:16,724
it's a dangerous place to be.

822
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:20,204
We've been good to you.
My whole family has.

823
01:07:20,413 --> 01:07:23,416
And you go on and do
something like this to me.

824
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:27,420
A nigger baptizing a white man
on my property!

825
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:29,296
Do you know
how this makes us look?

826
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:32,591
This could ruin everything
we worked for!

827
01:07:33,134 --> 01:07:36,220
Boy, you better
say something and quick!

828
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,807
"Take heed therefore
unto yourselves...

829
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:41,225
"and to all the flock
over which

830
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:43,436
"the Holy Ghost hath
made you overseers.

831
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:45,062
"To feed the church of God

832
01:07:45,146 --> 01:07:48,232
"which He has purchased
with his own blood."

833
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:50,151
Ex...

834
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:51,986
"Exhort servants

835
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:54,989
"to be obedient
to thy own masters...

836
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:56,574
"and to please them well

837
01:07:56,657 --> 01:07:58,097
"in all things
not answering again... "

838
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:01,245
"You were bought with a price,
do not become slaves of men."

839
01:08:01,454 --> 01:08:04,248
"He that shall blaspheme
against the Holy Ghost

840
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:06,834
"hath never forgiveness,
but is in danger... "

841
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:08,502
"Beware of false prophets

842
01:08:08,586 --> 01:08:09,980
"who come dressed
in sheep's clothing...

843
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:11,505
"but inwardly are
ravening wolves!"

844
01:08:11,756 --> 01:08:13,174
You black bastard!
Nat!

845
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:14,651
"He that stealeth a man
and selleth him..."

846
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:15,760
Don't you eyeball me, boy!

847
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:17,154
"...or if he be found
in his hand, he shall surely

848
01:08:17,178 --> 01:08:18,179
"be put to death!"

849
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:29,857
Get him to the post.

850
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:40,761
Hey, boy.

851
01:09:43,097 --> 01:09:46,100
If you make it
out of this alive...

852
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:50,938
I'm gonna ride you harder
than hogs on slop.

853
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:56,944
Die.

854
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:15,499
You learned your lesson, boy?

855
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:20,921
Oh, yes, sir, I've learned.

856
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:23,507
Go on, get him off.

857
01:12:28,554 --> 01:12:30,514
You're done preachin'
for a little while.

858
01:12:30,723 --> 01:12:32,643
And I don't want you
runnin' off with any groups,

859
01:12:32,725 --> 01:12:35,269
unless me and Jethro
are there, you understand?

860
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:37,521
Yes, sir.

861
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:39,940
All right, go and get yourself
cleaned up.

862
01:12:40,107 --> 01:12:42,735
Be back in the field
come morning.

863
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:00,753
Brother, you all right?

864
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:05,257
Hey! Hey!

865
01:13:20,314 --> 01:13:22,691
I watched your
grandfather die...

866
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:25,319
in old land.

867
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:30,616
Saw him give up the ghost
with my own eyes.

868
01:13:31,492 --> 01:13:33,494
And he saw me.

869
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:37,164
He harnessed
the Holy Spirit that day.

870
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:39,500
Yes, he did.

871
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:41,293
I was proud of him.

872
01:13:43,504 --> 01:13:45,506
So proud.

873
01:13:46,048 --> 01:13:47,674
I still thank God...

874
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:52,346
that he died that day.

875
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,517
That he didn't live
to see the things I seen.

876
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:04,191
To watch a strong man
broken down...

877
01:14:05,734 --> 01:14:08,362
is a terrible thing.

878
01:14:43,564 --> 01:14:45,732
Hey, Nana.

879
01:14:51,905 --> 01:14:54,241
The stitches held up good.

880
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:09,590
Nana?

881
01:16:11,818 --> 01:16:13,654
You all right?

882
01:16:21,495 --> 01:16:23,121
Mostly.

883
01:16:32,339 --> 01:16:35,717
I need you to round up
a few men you trust.

884
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:37,302
Have them meet us
at the big cypress

885
01:16:37,386 --> 01:16:39,888
at Cabin Pond
night after next.

886
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:44,351
Hark.

887
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:47,688
He's still here, brother.

888
01:16:48,897 --> 01:16:51,149
Even now.

889
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:11,545
This is Simon.

890
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:14,548
Samuel bought him
a month back in Norfolk.

891
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:16,675
I remember. Welcome, brother.

892
01:17:16,842 --> 01:17:18,385
And you knew Nelson.

893
01:17:19,553 --> 01:17:21,013
Welcome.

894
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:22,556
This is Will.

895
01:17:23,557 --> 01:17:26,351
Word travels fast. Welcome.

896
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:30,564
Hey! This grown folk's
business! Get! Get!

897
01:17:30,772 --> 01:17:32,190
Hold on.

898
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:34,192
Come on over here.

899
01:17:39,406 --> 01:17:40,407
Come from Randall's?

900
01:17:40,574 --> 01:17:41,575
Yes, sir.

901
01:17:41,742 --> 01:17:43,201
He's just a boy.

902
01:17:43,368 --> 01:17:44,745
So was David.

903
01:17:46,455 --> 01:17:48,957
Come on. Have a seat.

904
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:03,221
I've been following
the Lord a long time.

905
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:06,975
Preachin', citing scripture...

906
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:09,770
sharing the Gospel
from the few pages

907
01:18:09,895 --> 01:18:11,772
and sections
I've been allowed.

908
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:14,941
But I've gone back
through this Word, all of it.

909
01:18:15,067 --> 01:18:16,985
With new eyes.

910
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:18,945
I see now, for every verse

911
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:20,489
they use to support
our bondage...

912
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:22,783
there's another
demanding our freedom.

913
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:26,995
Every verse they use
to justify our torture...

914
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:30,290
there's another damning them
to Hell for those actions.

915
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:35,670
Lord has spoken to me.
Visions of what's to come.

916
01:18:35,796 --> 01:18:38,256
A rise of good against evil.

917
01:18:38,465 --> 01:18:42,010
The first shall be last,
and the last shall be first.

918
01:18:45,806 --> 01:18:48,141
Brothers, we've been chosen.

919
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:50,143
What are we gonna do?

920
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:52,020
Same as David and Gideon...

921
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:55,816
and Joshua and Samson.

922
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:58,610
We'll fight.
The six of us?

923
01:18:58,819 --> 01:19:00,821
At first. But once it begins,

924
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:02,306
our brothers and sisters
will join.

925
01:19:02,447 --> 01:19:03,824
There's a whole lot of whites.

926
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:05,676
How many slaves you think
there are in the county?

927
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:09,037
On all the plantations?
How many whites?

928
01:19:09,496 --> 01:19:10,705
But they got guns.

929
01:19:10,831 --> 01:19:12,191
We'll take the armory
in Jerusalem.

930
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:13,792
We'll have guns, too.

931
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:15,502
Jerusalem?

932
01:19:15,669 --> 01:19:17,671
That's right.
It's only 10 miles north.

933
01:19:18,213 --> 01:19:19,533
We'll start right here
at Turner's

934
01:19:19,631 --> 01:19:20,841
and fight our way there.

935
01:19:21,049 --> 01:19:22,801
By then we'll number
in the hundreds,

936
01:19:22,884 --> 01:19:24,636
thousands even.

937
01:19:24,845 --> 01:19:27,514
The grapevine's ablaze
with talks of fightin'.

938
01:19:27,681 --> 01:19:30,058
Slaves all over
havin' meetins'.

939
01:19:30,183 --> 01:19:31,852
They waitin' on something.

940
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,478
They waitin' on us.

941
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,567
We make a stop
at Fowler place?

942
01:19:38,692 --> 01:19:40,360
We will.

943
01:19:42,863 --> 01:19:43,989
I'm with you.

944
01:19:44,156 --> 01:19:45,198
Me, too.

945
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,200
- When we fight?
- Soon.

946
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:49,536
The Lord will give us a sign.

947
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:51,204
Until then
we remain steadfast,

948
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:53,707
ready to strike at the moment
of the Lord's call.

949
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:55,876
With the strength
of our Father,

950
01:19:56,001 --> 01:19:57,502
we'll cut the head
from the serpent.

951
01:19:58,712 --> 01:20:00,922
We'll destroy them all.

952
01:20:31,745 --> 01:20:32,787
Somethin' wrong?

953
01:20:32,913 --> 01:20:35,749
There was a meeting
a few nights ago.

954
01:20:35,957 --> 01:20:38,585
And although I was not
privy to what was said...

955
01:20:38,752 --> 01:20:40,921
I can only assume...

956
01:20:41,129 --> 01:20:45,050
by the secrecy that it was not
altogether productive.

957
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:04,569
<i>Now, I don't know
what ideas</i>

958
01:21:04,653 --> 01:21:06,947
<i>is floatin' around
in your head...</i>

959
01:21:08,156 --> 01:21:10,283
<i>but I been around here
long enough to know...</i>

960
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:12,494
that the result
of certain ideas

961
01:21:12,619 --> 01:21:14,621
is not gonna get you
what you want.

962
01:21:14,788 --> 01:21:16,957
All I want...

963
01:21:17,165 --> 01:21:19,167
I want for the oppressed
people of God.

964
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:21,795
You want death for them?

965
01:21:23,255 --> 01:21:24,256
For your wife?

966
01:21:25,966 --> 01:21:27,133
For your daughter?

967
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,426
If it be God's will.

968
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:30,637
God's will?

969
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,890
And who determined you

970
01:21:33,974 --> 01:21:35,850
to be the instrument
of such a thing?

971
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:37,769
He has.

972
01:21:42,816 --> 01:21:43,858
You just make sure that

973
01:21:43,984 --> 01:21:45,224
He's the one doin'
the orderin'.

974
01:21:45,443 --> 01:21:50,198
Man of God is called
to lead in love.

975
01:21:50,448 --> 01:21:53,493
Anything else
will leave us all worse off.

976
01:21:53,702 --> 01:21:56,997
He is a god of love, Nat.

977
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:59,666
Don't you forget that.

978
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:01,668
I won't.

979
01:22:01,835 --> 01:22:04,838
Nor will I forget
He's a god of wrath.

980
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:18,560
Mmm...

981
01:22:32,032 --> 01:22:34,242
The Lord's calling me.

982
01:22:36,828 --> 01:22:38,079
To stand and fight.

983
01:22:48,882 --> 01:22:51,885
I knew this day would come.

984
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:58,058
I told myself
I wouldn't be scared.

985
01:22:59,893 --> 01:23:02,062
All my life...

986
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:06,524
I've been praying
for the Lord to help us...

987
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:10,070
or to send someone who could.

988
01:23:11,071 --> 01:23:13,073
We all have.

989
01:23:14,282 --> 01:23:18,912
Just wasn't expecting it
to be my own husband.

990
01:23:31,758 --> 01:23:34,260
If the Lord's
called you to fight...

991
01:23:35,637 --> 01:23:37,764
you fight.

992
01:23:38,765 --> 01:23:41,309
You fight for me...

993
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,562
and Joanna.

994
01:23:48,108 --> 01:23:51,111
You fight for us all.

995
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:52,821
Hmm?

996
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:04,392
Who's there?

997
01:25:09,397 --> 01:25:11,024
Nat?

998
01:25:11,191 --> 01:25:12,859
Yes.

999
01:25:31,669 --> 01:25:33,671
Wait, goddamnit!

1000
01:25:38,051 --> 01:25:39,427
Damn it!

1001
01:27:16,774 --> 01:27:18,318
Momma?

1002
01:27:22,155 --> 01:27:23,781
Momma.

1003
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:28,536
Nat?
Oh Lord, I slept too late.

1004
01:27:28,786 --> 01:27:30,663
No, no... Momma.

1005
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,792
You won't have to work today.

1006
01:27:35,543 --> 01:27:37,337
You free.

1007
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:47,847
The battle's begun, Ma.

1008
01:27:49,015 --> 01:27:50,808
Simon.

1009
01:27:54,312 --> 01:27:56,564
Simon will take you
to Reese's.

1010
01:27:56,814 --> 01:27:58,667
And I need you to take care
of Cherry and Joanna

1011
01:27:58,691 --> 01:28:00,568
'till I get back, you hear?

1012
01:28:03,363 --> 01:28:05,031
What's wrong?

1013
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:06,741
Nothing.

1014
01:28:08,701 --> 01:28:10,578
I'm proud of you.

1015
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:30,348
What did you do, boy? Huh?

1016
01:28:31,265 --> 01:28:32,517
Huh? You killed them, boy?

1017
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,519
Is that what you did?

1018
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:38,398
You kill them and you kill us!

1019
01:28:43,403 --> 01:28:46,072
You killed all of us.

1020
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:49,409
We already dead.
We already dead!

1021
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:53,246
You dead.

1022
01:28:53,454 --> 01:28:55,748
We already dead.

1023
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:02,088
We dead now!

1024
01:29:08,428 --> 01:29:10,096
Your...

1025
01:29:10,263 --> 01:29:13,224
earthly master is gone.

1026
01:29:14,434 --> 01:29:18,271
You're now free
men and women...

1027
01:29:18,438 --> 01:29:20,106
servants of only the Lord.

1028
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:25,111
As the sword of the Lord
bears down on our enemies...

1029
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:27,947
our ancestors
and unborn children rejoice.

1030
01:29:29,449 --> 01:29:31,451
Are we dead?

1031
01:29:34,912 --> 01:29:38,291
No.
I say we are now alive...

1032
01:29:38,458 --> 01:29:40,334
seeing through eyes
that have been denied us...

1033
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:43,463
since being born
into the darkness of bondage.

1034
01:29:46,257 --> 01:29:47,257
Stand with us.

1035
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:49,135
Let your other captive
brothers and sisters

1036
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:50,303
also know freedom.

1037
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:52,096
Stand that our children

1038
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:53,580
for generations
to come will know...

1039
01:29:53,681 --> 01:29:55,284
that with the supernatural
power of God...

1040
01:29:55,308 --> 01:29:56,434
we straightened our backs

1041
01:29:56,517 --> 01:29:58,644
against the works
of the evil one!

1042
01:30:00,855 --> 01:30:02,940
Stand with us.

1043
01:30:56,494 --> 01:30:58,746
Can I do this myself?

1044
01:31:56,596 --> 01:31:59,599
The boy! He gone!

1045
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:10,443
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1046
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:31,464
Get down!

1047
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:35,468
Hey, preacher!

1048
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:37,094
Hark!

1049
01:32:37,303 --> 01:32:39,180
Are you out there?

1050
01:32:39,305 --> 01:32:40,681
Tell the men to fall back.

1051
01:32:40,848 --> 01:32:42,308
What?

1052
01:32:42,475 --> 01:32:43,809
If we have a gun battle now,

1053
01:32:43,935 --> 01:32:45,120
we'll never make it
to Jerusalem.

1054
01:32:45,144 --> 01:32:46,187
Me and my boys
is ready!

1055
01:32:46,312 --> 01:32:47,396
I want my revenge!

1056
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,689
This ain't
about revenge, Hark!

1057
01:32:48,814 --> 01:32:51,817
You all gonna hang!
You hear me?

1058
01:32:51,943 --> 01:32:53,653
All of ya!

1059
01:32:55,821 --> 01:32:57,865
The root...

1060
01:32:58,115 --> 01:32:59,158
not the branch.

1061
01:33:01,494 --> 01:33:02,995
We must stay focused, brother.

1062
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:08,501
Will! Fall back! C'mon!
C'mon, y'all. C'mon.

1063
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:10,795
Let's fall back, y'all!

1064
01:33:35,528 --> 01:33:37,363
You all right?

1065
01:33:40,032 --> 01:33:42,118
It's all of us.

1066
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:43,327
This it?

1067
01:34:02,888 --> 01:34:04,932
Hark, what time
you think it is?

1068
01:34:05,933 --> 01:34:08,728
5:30, 5:35.

1069
01:34:12,398 --> 01:34:14,400
What?

1070
01:34:16,777 --> 01:34:20,406
By now I'd be two rows down...

1071
01:34:20,573 --> 01:34:21,782
half a bag full.

1072
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:24,952
I'd be headed to the barn...

1073
01:34:25,202 --> 01:34:26,954
gettin' ready
to feed the stock.

1074
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:29,248
I'd be boiling
water in the smokehouse,

1075
01:34:29,373 --> 01:34:31,292
thinkin' 'bout dumping
on massa's head.

1076
01:34:32,877 --> 01:34:34,920
I'd be tying the barrels,
sealin' cracks.

1077
01:34:35,087 --> 01:34:37,173
Checkin' the leaves and straw.

1078
01:34:37,256 --> 01:34:39,592
Packin' and stackin' 'em up.

1079
01:34:40,426 --> 01:34:43,429
Dodgin' that cracker's lash.

1080
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,767
Not today.

1081
01:34:47,975 --> 01:34:49,769
No, sir.

1082
01:34:49,977 --> 01:34:52,271
Not today.

1083
01:34:56,567 --> 01:34:58,444
On to Jerusalem?

1084
01:34:58,986 --> 01:35:00,279
On to Jerusalem.

1085
01:35:00,446 --> 01:35:01,781
On to Jerusalem!

1086
01:35:25,388 --> 01:35:27,056
All right, this is how
this is gonna work.

1087
01:35:29,058 --> 01:35:30,619
You're gonna throw the weapons
to the ground,

1088
01:35:30,643 --> 01:35:33,229
then you're gonna lie down.

1089
01:35:35,815 --> 01:35:37,316
Do it.

1090
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:42,488
The Lord is our light
and our salvation.

1091
01:35:43,322 --> 01:35:44,657
Of whom we shall fear?

1092
01:35:46,283 --> 01:35:48,160
Throw your weapons
to the ground!

1093
01:35:48,327 --> 01:35:51,330
The Lord is the strength
of our lives.

1094
01:35:51,497 --> 01:35:53,749
Of whom shall we be afraid?

1095
01:35:56,335 --> 01:35:58,921
When the wicked,
even our enemies

1096
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:00,256
and our foes came upon us...

1097
01:36:00,464 --> 01:36:02,967
to eat up our flesh,
they stumbled and fell!

1098
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,427
Goddamn, niggers.

1099
01:36:04,635 --> 01:36:06,178
Though a host
shall encamp against us,

1100
01:36:06,262 --> 01:36:08,097
our hearts will not fear!

1101
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:09,181
Ready!

1102
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:10,450
Though war
shall rise against us,

1103
01:36:10,474 --> 01:36:11,809
in this we will be confident!

1104
01:36:12,017 --> 01:36:13,519
Aim!

1105
01:36:16,647 --> 01:36:18,107
Rebel!

1106
01:37:44,443 --> 01:37:45,903
Come on!

1107
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:01,085
Get down!

1108
01:38:36,954 --> 01:38:38,163
Will!

1109
01:38:57,516 --> 01:38:59,351
Get back!

1110
01:39:10,529 --> 01:39:12,531
I'm all right.

1111
01:39:44,647 --> 01:39:46,482
<i>Southern trees</i>

1112
01:39:51,987 --> 01:39:55,074
<i>Bearing strange fruit</i>

1113
01:39:59,244 --> 01:40:01,497
<i>Blood on the leaves</i>

1114
01:40:06,043 --> 01:40:08,671
<i>And blood at the root</i>

1115
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:19,264
<i>Black bodies swinging
in the southern breeze</i>

1116
01:40:26,397 --> 01:40:30,109
<i>Strange fruit hanging</i>

1117
01:40:32,444 --> 01:40:34,613
<i>From the poplar trees</i>

1118
01:40:39,785 --> 01:40:41,912
<i>Pastoral scene</i>

1119
01:40:43,789 --> 01:40:47,793
<i>Of the gallant south</i>

1120
01:40:52,297 --> 01:40:55,759
<i>Them big, bulging eyes</i>

1121
01:40:57,136 --> 01:41:00,431
<i>And the twisted mouth</i>

1122
01:41:05,269 --> 01:41:08,939
<i>Scent of magnolia</i>

1123
01:41:09,815 --> 01:41:13,485
<i>Clean and fresh</i>

1124
01:41:18,615 --> 01:41:20,826
<i>Here is a fruit</i>

1125
01:41:43,307 --> 01:41:44,850
Cherry.

1126
01:41:50,272 --> 01:41:51,273
It's Nat, love.

1127
01:41:53,692 --> 01:41:55,694
Keep on workin'.

1128
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:03,702
They lookin' for you.

1129
01:42:07,623 --> 01:42:09,333
They hurt you?

1130
01:42:10,334 --> 01:42:12,336
No.

1131
01:42:13,837 --> 01:42:15,714
How's Joanna?

1132
01:42:17,174 --> 01:42:19,343
She fine.

1133
01:42:20,552 --> 01:42:21,887
Momma?

1134
01:42:22,137 --> 01:42:24,348
She fine, too.

1135
01:42:27,309 --> 01:42:28,894
Keep on workin' now.

1136
01:42:30,187 --> 01:42:32,064
Any word on the other men?

1137
01:42:32,314 --> 01:42:34,233
They been hanged.

1138
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,568
All of them.

1139
01:42:39,571 --> 01:42:41,240
They killin' people everywhere

1140
01:42:41,365 --> 01:42:44,159
for no reason at all
but being black.

1141
01:42:47,162 --> 01:42:50,749
They say the killin'
won't stop...

1142
01:42:50,916 --> 01:42:53,377
'till they get you.

1143
01:43:00,926 --> 01:43:02,761
All these months...

1144
01:43:05,389 --> 01:43:07,391
I thought...

1145
01:43:12,396 --> 01:43:14,773
I thought you were dead, too.

1146
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:19,778
I'm here, love.

1147
01:43:20,946 --> 01:43:22,781
I'll always be.

1148
01:43:28,912 --> 01:43:31,790
I miss you so much.

1149
01:43:38,213 --> 01:43:39,965
Cherry?

1150
01:43:40,799 --> 01:43:42,801
Who you talkin' to?

1151
01:43:45,637 --> 01:43:48,432
I's just talkin' to myself.

1152
01:43:52,144 --> 01:43:54,646
Wishin' things was different.

1153
01:44:39,858 --> 01:44:41,485
Hey!

1154
01:44:46,782 --> 01:44:48,867
That's him right there!

1155
01:44:49,117 --> 01:44:50,953
Kill that nigger!

1156
01:44:56,541 --> 01:44:59,544
I know you're angry.
Trust me, I am too.

1157
01:44:59,795 --> 01:45:04,007
This boy committed mass murder
and will hang for all to see.

1158
01:45:04,216 --> 01:45:05,884
Get him up.

1159
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:36,266
Go to Hell!

1160
01:46:38,101 --> 01:46:39,978
Animal!

1161
01:47:05,504 --> 01:47:07,089
Hang him!

1162
01:47:21,019 --> 01:47:22,521
Is there something
you wanna say

1163
01:47:22,646 --> 01:47:24,439
to these good people?

1164
01:47:32,531 --> 01:47:34,449
I'm ready.

1164
01:47:35,305 --> 01:48:35,937
