2
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,608
Shit.

3
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,933
What the hell are you doing out here?

4
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,182
I had to drive all night.

5
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,687
I'm hungover as shit.

6
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,319
And you're really starting
to cut into my vacation time,

7
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,395
so can we go, please?

8
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,945
We'll take my car. Come on.

9
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,697
I don't think so.

10
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,994
Why you making...
Why are you gonna make this difficult?

11
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,870
What's difficult? He turns himself in.
Then it's easy.

12
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,043
Turns himself in. Why would he do that?

13
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,259
What exactly did he say I did?

14
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,963
He didn't. He just said to come pick you up.

15
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,595
Nothing else? Nothing about Barcelona?

16
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,926
No.

17
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,012
Nothing about Dublin? Nothing about Paul?

18
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,320
Hi. Can I get you something?

19
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,897
- Need a minute?
- Y'all have beer?

20
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,487
No, I wish.

21
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,568
Just a coffee. Black.

22
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,158
Okay, if you got something to say, say it.

23
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,493
Aaron...

24
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,830
Have you even seen him?

25
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,298
No.

26
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,433
You're really not getting in the car, are you?

27
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,605
No.

28
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,071
- Thank you.
- Have you got any...

29
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,868
You need to get in the car, Mallory!

30
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,502
- You got a car? You got a car?
- What?

31
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,341
- Which one?
- This one.

32
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,090
No, no, passenger side. Give me your keys.

33
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,546
- Here.
- Keys!

34
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,520
What's happening?
Where are you taking me?

35
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,439
Put your seatbelt on.

36
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,190
Shit!

37
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,988
- What's your name?
- Scott.

38
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,444
- I'm Mallory.
- Hi.

39
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,531
You're gonna fix my arm while we drive.
Okay, Scott?

40
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,831
Yeah.

41
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,882
Okay. Here. Ready?

42
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,479
- Okay.
- Now take two of the dry packets,

43
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,525
put them on the one
you already have in place.

44
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,944
- Yeah?
- Now take the tape,

45
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,114
wrap it around the gauze
so it stays on my arm.

46
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,156
- Tight.
- Yeah.

47
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,578
- Sorry.
- Couple times around.

48
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,405
- Watch your arm.
- Yeah.

49
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,497
Okay, now tape... Use the scissors to cut it.

50
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,330
- Okay.
- Okay.

51
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,585
That should be good for now.

52
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,543
Jesus Christ.

53
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,629
- I'm hyperventilating.
- Scott.

54
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,635
Thank you.

55
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,761
Yeah, sure.

56
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,847
So, who...

57
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,474
Who was that guy?

58
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,102
- I mean, honestly.
- Aaron?

59
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,274
Someone I worked with.

60
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:47,320
- Was he your... You know.
- No.

61
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,613
No.

62
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,565
Where did you work with him?

63
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,070
Barcelona.

64
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,162
I...

65
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,161
I don't mean to, you know, get personal.

66
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,868
- Are you in the drug business?
- No.

67
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,420
Are you with the government?

68
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,873
They contracted a company I work for.

69
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,005
Private company.

70
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,508
Wow. That's actually real?

71
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,056
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.

72
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,724
So what do you do? What's your job?

73
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,101
Barcelona. Separatists?

74
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,773
No, no. It's clean.

75
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,353
Negotiations broke down,
just need somebody to go and get the guy.

76
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,990
Okay, whatever.

77
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,917
In four points,

78
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,746
a better immunity language,
more access to intelligence,

79
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,626
this fee structure is unacceptable.

80
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,666
I ntelligence?

81
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,336
Y eah, I need parity with Rodrigo here
and all his people.

82
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,973
You're with State, right?

83
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,351
Yes.

84
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,895
You like it?

85
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,809
I like the idea of me doing my job

86
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,736
more than the idea
of someone else doing my job.

87
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:14,317
All right, now the immunity language
is as good as we can do.

88
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,868
Fee structure... A number?

89
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,328
Yeah, we need to adjust the overall payment

90
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,328
in order that we can address things
like hazard bumps.

91
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,624
I'll make a list.
But also how the installments are spaced.

92
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,376
Fewer steps.

93
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,623
Hi.

94
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
Hey.

95
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,630
What, am I first?

96
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,510
Yeah, Victor will be here at 4:30,
and Jamie's running late.

97
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,346
There's always a cash flow problem.

98
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,556
This is a short timetable, Kenneth.
Should I be nervous?

99
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,394
If it will make you feel better,

100
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,898
you can get the people
that did the Mexico job, Alex.

101
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,654
Look, I know it's more efficient
if we wait for everybody to get here,

102
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:00,863
but you want to start going through this?
I've got some ideas.

103
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,291
You're right. It's more efficient
if we wait for everyone to get here.

104
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,497
This should be fun.

105
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,708
- Your kit's under your bed.
- Yours check out?

106
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,511
- Good to go.
- I'll check later then, thank you.

107
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,590
There's no smoking in here.

108
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,094
Okay.

109
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,553
It's a phone.

110
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,520
Tell me about Kenneth.

111
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,061
What about him?

112
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,148
How long have you worked together?

113
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,778
Three years.

114
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,411
Not so long.

115
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,990
It is in this business.

116
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,165
You said four points.

117
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,994
You have Mallory Kane
as an essential element.

118
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,044
Is that a problem?

119
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,588
Not a good precedent for me,
for my business.

120
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,631
Well, it doesn't work for us
if she's not involved.

121
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,300
She's not available.

122
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,887
You mind if I call and check on that?

123
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,017
I didn't realize
your interest extended to personnel.

124
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,143
No, no. No, when somebody's good,
it comes to my attention.

125
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,145
It's come to my attention
you're spreading yourself a little thin.

126
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,648
Kenneth, I don't want your B-team.
She's value-added.

127
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,730
Only reason we came to you.

128
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,571
All right, I'll free her up.

129
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,825
And I'll forego the hazard bumps
if you remove the essential element clause.

130
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,748
- That important, huh?
- Do you want her in Barcelona or not?

131
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,479
Explain it to me then.
So I can understand it.

132
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,772
How are we not light?

133
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,991
So we have a man in the car,
we got a man at the door.

134
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,818
Leaves you two to breach with.

135
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,078
You're going hot on a hostage rescue.

136
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,327
There's two rooms inside.

137
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,329
So, the way I read it,

138
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,787
you're either two men short in one room,
or you're one man short in each room.

139
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,832
Anyone else think we're light?

140
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,168
Us?

141
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,423
No way.

142
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,759
Good to go.

143
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,009
Good to go.

144
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,291
You tracking me with the names?

145
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,876
Repeat them.

146
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,298
Mallory. Kenneth. Aaron.

147
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,510
Jamie. Victor. Rodrigo.

148
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,971
Barcelona.

149
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,308
Hostage name.

150
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,733
- Yang.
- Jiang.

151
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,981
Shit. Jiang. Jiang.

152
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,815
Don't speak. Walk in front of me.

153
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,448
If I touch you, drop to your knees.
Do you understand?

154
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,118
Done.

155
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,298
They all gone?

156
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,720
Yeah.

157
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:26,515
When that guy took off,
why'd you chase him?

158
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,564
We already had Jiang in the backseat.

159
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,641
I don't like loose ends.

160
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,235
Is this your idea of relaxing?

161
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,239
Wine and gun maintenance?

162
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,163
There's another glass in the kitchen.

163
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,830
You gonna leave your name
and number afterwards?

164
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,500
Why? You want it?

165
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,462
You're gonna leave Kenneth?

166
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,681
I left Kenneth six months ago.

167
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,727
I meant the company.

168
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,645
You're gonna leave the company?

169
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,770
Company, I left an hour ago.

170
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,351
How come?

171
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,607
'Cause I'm not going down with the ship.

172
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,111
Are you?

173
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,614
If he's paying, yeah, I'm staying.

174
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,415
If you stay...

175
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,371
I don't know, maybe...

176
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,908
Hi.

177
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,951
What are you doing here?

178
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,238
Gate key still worked.

179
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,040
I didn't change everyone's locks, just mine.

180
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,663
Hey, I came by
'cause you weren't picking up.

181
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,621
- I just landed.
- Yeah, two hours ago.

182
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,586
I've been away for nine weeks.
That was my third job in a row.

183
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,007
Give me a break.

184
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,584
You wouldn't know what to do with a break.

185
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,340
You think you know me?

186
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,347
I know you.

187
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,229
I bet he's just like his books.

188
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,931
- What?
- Your father.

189
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,392
I bet he's just like the characters
in his books.

190
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,476
How would you know?

191
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,108
You've never read one of his books
and you've never met him.

192
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,485
I'm just going off his photograph.

193
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,280
What do you want?

194
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,284
The usual. I have an assignment.

195
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,117
Well, your timing sucks.
I haven't even unpacked yet.

196
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,873
This'll take no time at all.
It's like a paid holiday.

197
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,875
This will take no time at all starting when?

198
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,790
Well, tonight.

199
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,214
I mean, you would have to leave tonight.

200
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:33,595
Well, if it is a paid holiday,
then it doesn't have to be me.

201
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,392
I'm overqualified.

202
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,182
The client has asked for you.

203
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,644
Mallory, it's Ml6.
It's a new in for me. I can expand.

204
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,399
Yeah, sounds great. For you.

205
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,980
Let me turn the volume up a little here.

206
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,532
You probably heard me
mention the name Paul.

207
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,701
Paul. Never, not once.

208
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,201
Well, Paul, he's one of us,
but he's freelance.

209
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,157
Actually, I was hoping
you might convince him to come aboard,

210
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,412
but that's secondary.

211
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:03,166
Paul has managed to get close
to a curious character named Studer,

212
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,919
and our client
wants to take advantage of this.

213
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,002
Studer is a French national
residing in Ireland.

214
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,836
It's tricky, they want a light footprint.

215
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,173
- Well, you've got Paul.
- I've got Paul, but Paul...

216
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,886
Paul has presented himself
as one half of a power couple.

217
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,938
This is your pitch?

218
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,687
You want me to be eye candy?

219
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,893
Ml6 wants me to be eye candy?

220
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,020
Mallory, you are the eye.

221
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,570
I don't even know how to play that.

222
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,902
I don't wear the dress.

223
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,740
- Make Paul wear the dress.
- Well, I'll ask.

224
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,918
Look, do this and then we'll go away
afterwards. We'll go to Majorca.

225
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:47,290
- Majorca?
- Not like before, as friends.

226
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,874
You can take a break.

227
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,011
It's literally two days.

228
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,797
Paul. That's Paul.

229
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,928
You guys would be like the perfect couple.

230
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,640
So he'll know you.

231
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,524
I need this to happen.

232
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,329
- Hi.
- Hi.

233
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,054
My better half. You look great.

234
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,746
Mind if I freshen up first?

235
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,171
Presumably, you'll need more time.

236
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,877
Go ahead.

237
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,559
All yours.

238
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,864
Wow. You look fantastic.

239
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,243
Can you zip me?

240
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,910
Of course.

241
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,094
- I'm leaving my gun.
- Me, too.

242
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,492
Shall we?

243
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,001
Russborough. Remember Russborough.

244
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,382
Russborough.

245
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,800
Who's Russborough?

246
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,378
Not a who. A what. A place.

247
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,096
It's where we were supposed to meet Studer.

248
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,197
Not your natural habitat, is it?

249
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,927
Wrong side of the tracks.

250
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,129
Kept getting into fights.

251
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,714
Bleak future.

252
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,393
Kenneth knows
how to put trouble to good use.

253
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,225
I'm empty.

254
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,488
- You have family?
- Both parents, still going strong.

255
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,815
T eachers.

256
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,494
Two brothers and a rather adorable niece.

257
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,945
Whiskey.

258
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,791
- They know what you do?
- No.

259
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,539
I can never lie to my dad.

260
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,086
Then he must worry about you.

261
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,913
I tell him not to.

262
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,710
Still keeping tabs?

263
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,966
I hate babysitting jobs.

264
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,344
That guy just recognized me.

265
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,975
- Who?
- Gray shirt, gray tie, goatee.

266
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,193
- You sure?
- Yeah.

267
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,440
Why would he know you?

268
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:53,071
'Cause the last time I saw him,
I was in Baghdad in my hotel room.

269
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,743
All right. Here comes our friend.

270
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,617
Well, it's obvious you're newlyweds.

271
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,123
Still talking to each other
instead of the other guests.

272
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,580
- I'm sorry. Are we being rude?
- No, no.

273
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:09,041
- Katie, Eric Studer.
- Hi.

274
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:13,470
Listen, I had some brainwave.
What are you two doing afterwards?

275
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,139
Well, I don't know. You're jet-lagged, right?

276
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,384
No, I'm sorry. I mean tomorrow, this week.

277
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,844
No particular plans.

278
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,305
- We were going back to London.
- London?

279
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,062
I may have better than this.

280
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,357
We're going to Saint Moritz.

281
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,530
- "We"?
- Yeah, some friends.

282
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,574
It'll be fun. We'll fly in,
put you up at a Suvretta.

283
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,652
- Well...
- Do you ski?

284
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,738
- Snowboard.
- These are the Alps, they're pretty steep.

285
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,949
Like the prices. We'll discuss it.

286
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,375
No, no, no discussion. We go.

287
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,999
I'll send the itinerary to your hotel.

288
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,417
Wheels up at 11:00.

289
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,625
Okay? Okay?

290
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,133
You locate Goatee. I'll take Studer.

291
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,940
Myself and a few friends
are heading to a nice little village.

292
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,017
Maybe you could come and join us.

293
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,444
- Sounds good.
- Yeah?

294
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,863
Bet you look good in white.
Fluffy, little bunny.

295
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,846
I should think Sunday.

296
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,599
Sunday?

297
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,606
Maybe Saturday, if we're lucky.

298
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,190
Then let's be lucky.

299
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,053
- Mrs. Hillier.
- Hi Katie.

300
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,760
Katie. You haven't promised to come skiing.

301
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,392
I can't even find my way around here.

302
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,064
Richard is in the other room. I just left him.

303
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,235
Well, actually, I was looking for the...

304
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:19,156
They're in the back of the library.

305
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,732
So much wine.

306
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,569
- So much to look at.
- Yeah.

307
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,406
You've only seen the inside.
I should show you the maze.

308
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,582
Isn't it a little dark out there?

309
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,079
Perfect time.

310
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,412
I get claustrophobic, even in the daytime.

311
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,670
No, the whole point is to relax
and lose yourself.

312
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,001
I'll take a rain check.

313
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,381
This is Ireland. Won't be long.

314
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,804
And to find your way back,
retrace your steps.

315
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,920
Fuck.

316
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,469
Hi.

317
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,298
- Where are you?
- In the bathroom.

318
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,724
I'm not used to drinking so much.

319
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,395
My friend from Baghdad has a date.
Well, a couple, actually.

320
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,768
I think it's the paid-for kind.

321
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,645
Where are you?

322
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,601
In the main room.

323
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,062
I spoke to Studer briefly
and made our apologies,

324
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,239
told him we'd discuss Saint Moritz
in the morning.

325
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,944
I think we should get back to the hotel
and talk to Kenneth, don't you?

326
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,043
Thank you.

327
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,892
Mallory, you're in way over your head.

328
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:45,769
Think this through.

329
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,602
You've been out of control
since you've arrived.

330
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,152
You need to call Kenneth.

331
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,999
Excuse me. I should take this.

332
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,459
Pauly?

333
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,956
So, is the divorce final?

334
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,252
Paul, are you there?

335
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,345
Mallory.

336
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:45,324
- Hello.
- Dad, it's Mal.

337
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:49,123
Things are kind of screwed up here
and I need to come home.

338
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,919
It may take me a couple of days,
depending on what happens.

339
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,496
Don't worry about me,
you just get here as quick as you can.

340
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,083
I'll try.

341
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,166
Keep your eyes open.

342
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,179
I haven't shut my eyes since you were born.

343
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,255
Just be careful.

344
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,012
And watch your six.

345
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,682
I will.

346
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,138
I'll see you at the house.

347
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,641
- Can I get this cell phone?
- It's €42.50.

348
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,027
There you go.

349
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,849
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Get over there. Let's go. Come on.

350
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,436
Rodrigo. Hi, it's Mallory Kane.

351
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,558
- Mallory Kane.
- I hope it's not too late.

352
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,981
I just landed in New York.
Do you have a minute?

353
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,605
I just felt like I had to call.
I was going over my report,

354
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:46,484
and I realized
I never thanked you for all your help.

355
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:51,535
It's really not necessary.
It's not even customary.

356
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,702
Well, it should be.

357
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,033
But I just wanted to verify one thing
with you before I actually file my report.

358
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:02,122
Was it you or Ken neth
who sold the Barcelona job to Studer?

359
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,508
Rodrigo.

360
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:52,471
What are you working so late for?
It's what, past 8: 00, your time?

361
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,800
Yeah. Listen, Mallory Kane just called me.

362
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,931
I thought you should know.

363
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,185
- Wait, she called you at home?
- Yes.

364
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,144
Was that a nice conversation?

365
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:12,199
Yeah, yeah, very nice.
Brief, but very nice. Yeah.

366
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,201
She thanked me for my assistance.

367
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,206
She still in Dublin?

368
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,830
She said she just landed in New York.

369
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,660
Good.

370
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:28,294
Good. Well,
why don't you stay off your house line,

371
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:33,046
and I wouldn't go outside till I call you back.

372
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,131
Or your family.

373
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,216
- I see. Thank you.
- All right.

374
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,017
Rodrigo, you take care, all right?

375
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,844
Yeah, sure. Bye.

376
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,113
Tyler, the activity log
for the number that I just sent you,

377
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:59,287
I want you to connect me
to the last incoming call.

378
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,245
Who is this?

379
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,169
Mallory, hi. My name is Alex Coblenz.

380
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:15,050
I was with Kenneth and Rodrigo
when the Barcelona deal went down.

381
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,597
Who else besides you knows about this?

382
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:21,552
No, only the people
that need to know in order to fix it.

383
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,763
The people who thought up Barcelona.

384
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,439
Mallory, we did not think up Barcelona.

385
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:29,393
No, you just helped.

386
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,900
- Can you bring me in?
- We can, yes,

387
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,323
but I'd like you
to keep doing what you're doing.

388
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:40,154
We want you to bust Kenneth's budget,
you know, see how he reacts.

389
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,661
Everyone he reaches out to,
you know, it's like another layer.

390
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:45,583
What do you think he's into?

391
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:48,583
Well, whatever it is,
Kenneth is not at the top.

392
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:54,419
It's just not possible. We like Studer.
We think there's something there.

393
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,549
You gotta get me off the watch list.

394
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,843
Mallory, I cannot do that.

395
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,016
You know, while Kenneth's watching,
he'll know we spoke.

396
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:07,439
I promise I'll do everything I can
to convince him to meet you.

397
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:09,642
Then you can find out
what we both want to know,

398
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,443
which is why this is happening.

399
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,240
I got a fake I D in London,
came in through Canada,

400
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,238
and crossed the border.

401
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:23,618
Coblenz helped me set up a meeting
with Kenneth, but Aaron showed up instead.

402
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,449
And then I met you.

403
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,915
There's some water in my backpack.

404
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,372
Have some.

405
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,217
Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

406
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,344
- You want some?
- Yeah, please.

407
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,721
- Help me.
- Yeah, sorry.

408
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,729
- Good?
- Yeah. Thanks.

409
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:00,033
What's going on here?

410
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,826
Random road check?

411
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:05,451
All right. Hold on.

412
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:17,876
Yep.

413
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,103
Jesus!

414
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,190
Jeez!

415
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:49,124
I just got this car, like, a week ago.

416
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,326
Yeah, well...

417
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,714
Whoops, more LEOs.

418
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:06,683
What's a LEO?

419
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,978
Law enforcement officers.

420
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,916
Shit!

421
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,834
Shit! Watch the car!

422
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,553
That was nice. That was nice.
That was really bad.

423
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,925
I thought
that was gonna be really bad for a second.

424
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,972
I thought I was gonna have a heart attack.
Oh, my God.

425
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,893
Jesus Christ! You are a great driver!

426
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,945
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, are you?

427
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:03,865
Yeah. Oh, my God! There's a deer in the car.

428
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,783
- Jesus...
- Yeah, I know.

429
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,793
- Should we run?
- No. Don't.

430
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,542
We've done enough.

431
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,717
Show me your hands.

432
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:30,050
- Freeze! Don't move!
- You, behind the car, step forward!

433
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,727
Hands in the air! Turn around!

434
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:33,849
Turn around, punk!

435
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,315
Unit three.

436
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:43,647
Unit three.

437
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:48,657
Proceed with suspects to 2345 Clearview.

438
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:53,036
Repeat, 2345 Clearview, and hold.

439
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:56,118
Federal agents en route.

440
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,703
U nit three, copy.

441
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,834
You must have stepped in something.

442
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,257
Y eah.

443
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,678
Excuse me, Deputy Cross?

444
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,721
Deputy Cross? Hi.

445
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,096
You were in the Corps, right?
I was a devil dog.

446
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:15,429
Listen, this might sound a little funny.

447
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:18,185
I'm a private contractor
on a 10-24 operation,

448
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,562
and these guys you're about to meet
are not federal agents.

449
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,395
I mean, follow your protocol and all,

450
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,355
but you should really keep your distance.

451
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:29,739
Use your radio and your loudspeakers
in order to confirm who these guys aren't.

452
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,535
Really, I'm not joking.

453
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:34,956
You can look me up,
a New Mexico license for Mallory Kane.

454
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:36,874
I'll confirm the number.

455
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,998
You need to sit back.

456
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:42,377
Look, an innocent civilian will be killed
if you do not listen to me.

457
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,834
Hey, Wonder Woman, you said your piece.
Now sit back and shut up.

458
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:51,241
- Jesus, are you...
- Get down!

459
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,416
Just keep your head down
a few more minutes and you're out of this.

460
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,749
Great, great. How are you gonna
get out of this, may I ask?

461
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:11,052
I'll just dump the car.
I'll find another ride. I'll catch a bus.

462
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,720
Great, good luck with that.

463
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,889
I can't wait till Coblenz hears about this.

464
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,217
- What is that?
- Listen, when we split,

465
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:19,177
I'm gonna give you a number to call.

466
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,480
I was supposed to be sleeping in late today,

467
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,432
not getting carjacked.

468
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,858
Scott, you still with me?

469
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:29,233
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, a number.
- Just tell them everything.

470
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:32,361
Tell the police, too,
tell them everything I've told you, okay?

471
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:34,317
- Yeah, okay.
- You did great.

472
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,903
- You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah. Okay.

473
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:41,074
This is the trouble
with the private sector, Kenneth.

474
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:44,411
You got that macho takedown,
but where's the due diligence?

475
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:45,746
Where's the follow-through?

476
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:50,547
Now, we got ourselves a real twizzler here.

477
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,340
And for eight figures,
I don't accept excuses,

478
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,514
explanations or rationales.

479
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,058
Now I don't even know
why the hell you're standing here.

480
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:02,433
You should be in her father's living room,
explaining to him,

481
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:06,608
telling him that his daughter
is a fugitive with ties to terrorists.

482
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:09,902
That she killed a man in cold blood
in Dublin and killed four cops.

483
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,772
You tell him.

484
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,112
Show him.

485
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:19,742
He'll come at you like he's government,
make me seem like a monster.

486
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,199
Play like you're shocked.

487
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:26,081
The guy with the broken arm, Aaron,

488
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,332
get in his head.

489
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,506
Keep bringing up Barcelona.

490
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,799
Get him arguing with Kenneth.

491
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,877
Kenneth.

492
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:37,556
My fault. I should've seen that one coming.

493
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,724
You did.

494
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:44,054
Hold up a sec, Mal.
Let's analyze your options.

495
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:46,481
We could leave right now, disappear.

496
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:49,651
We could be in Buenos Aires
this time tomorrow.

497
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,860
I'm not gonna run anymore.

498
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:02,410
Mr. Kane, these were taken by the police.
They're pretty graphic.

499
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,918
Her prints are all over the room.

500
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:10,714
The security video shows them
coming in together and her leaving alone.

501
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,463
The guest downstairs
complained about the noise.

502
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,260
Paul fought back,

503
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,679
but she obviously had
the element of surprise in her favor.

504
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,008
She choked him out
and she shot him in the head.

505
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:27,727
Add that to the four police,
and that is five dead in three days.

506
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:32,152
- Where was she last seen?
- Upstate New York, 36 hours ago.

507
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:35,651
- Was she alone?
- No, she was with a boy, 19.

508
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:38,484
She grabbed him at gunpoint.
Used him as a ride and a shield,

509
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:41,445
so we can add aggravated kidnapping
to the murder charges.

510
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:44,993
No, I'm sorry.

511
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:48,414
This doesn't sound like my daughter.

512
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:54,044
She ever mention the name Kenneth?

513
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,591
No.

514
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,127
Really?

515
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,680
He runs the company she worked for.

516
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:04,851
They were in a relationship for over a year,
and yet she never mentioned him to you?

517
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:07,641
What do you know about her?

518
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:09,977
Really, at the end of the day?

519
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,682
I raised her.

520
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,812
And denial is a very effective parenting tool.

521
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:17,898
She was a Marine. She does something,
there must be a reason for it.

522
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:21,655
Mr. Kane, she is no longer a Marine.
She is a murderer.

523
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,283
She is a public threat.
She's on a killing spree.

524
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,700
Now, you are the on ly person
that she can trust.

525
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,081
You're gonna help bring her in
before she kills again.

526
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,754
Without you, she won't survive this.

527
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,930
I heard from her.

528
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:49,595
Ten days ago.

529
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:53,187
She texted me,
said she was going to Barcelona.

530
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:55,815
What did she say exactly?

531
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,772
"Going to Barcelona. Call you after."

532
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,857
Six words, that's it?

533
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,408
Well, it was enough for me.

534
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,032
And she didn't mention Dublin?
She didn't say anything about this?

535
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:06,203
No.

536
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,708
Who was he?

537
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,662
He was an agent with British Intelligence.

538
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:18,591
Now, whether this was a murder-for-hire
or a crime of passion, we don't know.

539
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:20,134
Well, she would never kill someone
for money.

540
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,427
There must be an explanation.

541
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,347
Didn't this all start after Barcelona?

542
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,720
Maybe that has something to do
with why she's a fugitive.

543
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,551
Something must have happened there.

544
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,220
- Aaron.
- I'm on it.

545
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:41,736
It's overseas. Prepaid phone.
Yeah, that's gotta be her.

546
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,657
Wait for the track.

547
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:45,742
Go.

548
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,240
Talk to her.

549
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:51,825
Mallory.

550
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:55,036
Dad, don't say anything.
Give Kenneth the phone.

551
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,877
Just be careful.

552
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:11,261
Mallory, I hope you've decided
to turn yourself in.

553
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:13,597
You can tell me right now
why you sold me out

554
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,306
and what you're into with Studer,

555
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,891
or you can tell me in ten minutes,

556
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,693
when I have my hands around your throat.

557
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,234
You need to think for a minute, Mallory.

558
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:23,610
You need to stop pretending

559
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,317
you can achieve a desirable outcome
in this situation,

560
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,120
and turn yourself in.

561
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,823
Do it for the sake of your father.

562
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,658
Surrender now if you wanna live.

563
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:36,460
I'm sorry, Mallory, that's not possible.

564
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,663
All right, Kenneth. We'll do it your way.

565
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,794
She's...

566
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,125
She's here.

567
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:43,376
Here? Where?

568
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:46,971
In the house. Track says she's in the house.
Go, now. You sit down.

569
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:48,719
You knew about this?
You knew she was here?

570
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:53,520
No. I told you, I haven't heard from her
since she texted me.

571
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:54,891
Kenny.

572
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,984
Do we need to have a conversation
about Barcelona?

573
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:01,857
Aaron, you were in Barcelona.
You know what happened.

574
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,358
We rescued a man.

575
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:06,361
- Did we?
- Aaron, you need to focus right now.

576
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,317
You were in Barcelona?

577
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,447
I'm confused.
She works for a private company.

578
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,749
Breaker box. Get on it. Lock the doors.

579
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,332
- What if she's inside?
- Then we'll pressure-cook her.

580
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,667
We'll find her.

581
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,001
I don't mean to tell you your job,

582
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:28,304
but isn't there someone
you should be calling, Agent Milgrom?

583
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:31,133
Other officers of the law, to bring help?

584
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,092
We can handle this.

585
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,053
- Go.
- I got this. Watch him.

586
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:17,595
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

587
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,021
Get on it.

588
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,982
Tom's down. IED in the breaker box.

589
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:30,987
- We need to get to the car.
- I'm not sure if that'll help.

590
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,193
But she can't outrun a car.

591
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,990
She can if it's not running.

592
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,617
Well, then let's find out.

593
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,703
Be my guest. Go ahead.

594
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,378
You should see this.

595
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:48,004
Who did that? Her?

596
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,962
- Yeah, probably. That's why we're here.
- Doesn't make any sense, man.

597
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,514
- Aaron, let's not discuss this right now.
- No. We're gonna talk about it.

598
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:54,716
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

599
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,893
- What did you do?
- I did what I was contracted to do.

600
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,560
We were contracted to rescue somebody.

601
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,979
It seems to me,
you auctioned him off and tried to burn her.

602
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,432
- That's not what happened.
- Really?

603
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:03,858
- No, I can explain.
- Then explain it,

604
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,526
and try really hard.

605
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,072
Don't give me a reason.

606
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,556
No, just go help her!

607
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,371
- Kenneth!
- He's gone.

608
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,317
You better run.

609
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:01,680
I'm so stupid.

610
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:14,568
Can't believe I met you a week ago.

611
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,650
Eight, eight days.

612
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:22,363
We were in Barcelona eight days ago?

613
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:28,999
I'm trying to focus on my breathing.

614
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:29,722
Mal?

615
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,062
Mal?

616
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,063
Sweetheart?

617
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,785
It's okay.

618
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,921
In the auction business,
they have an expression

619
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,624
called "the halo effect."

620
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,755
You know what that is?

621
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:44,338
It's when an object or work of art
is more desirable

622
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,674
because of its prior ownership.

623
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:52,187
Very rare when it happens, you know?
Maybe once in a lifetime.

624
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,475
Gotta catch it when you can.

625
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:02,026
Look, I got plenty of drama in my own office.

626
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,824
You were his contact.

627
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:06,072
No, I was his employer.

628
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:08,495
There's a very big difference, trust me.

629
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,072
There's only one person I trust.

630
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,579
Your dad, yes. He okay?

631
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:16,003
He's fine. Thanks for cleaning up.

632
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:21,335
Well, I told you you can have Kenneth
alone at the house. I promised you that.

633
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:24,591
It should at least make me a colleague,

634
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:26,718
if not a friend.

635
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:29,175
And if something happens to you?

636
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,101
Well, then you're screwed.

637
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,974
One friend's not a lot.

638
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,681
It depends on who it is.

639
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:39,564
- And the kid who helped me?
- We'll fix the ding in his car.

640
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:43,732
Okay, I will buy him a new car.

641
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:47,201
What is that, an incentive?

642
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,367
It could be.

643
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:51,947
You gotta admit

644
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,658
that this type of life appeals
to a certain kind of person.

645
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:58,837
You know? You're off the grid,
you never answer to anybody.

646
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:02,382
Always looking over your shoulder.

647
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:07,721
And you got Kenneth out there
with all his contacts.

648
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,807
Makes you pretty vulnerable.

649
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,010
Where is he?

650
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:18,399
Well, Mallory, that is a valuable piece
of information, isn't it?

651
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,736
We think he's crossed the border.

652
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:25,360
Possible sightings in Veracruz.

653
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:30,240
But what would be nice to know
is what he gave everything up for.

654
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,159
So we're back to the government option.

655
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:39,120
Pays less, taxes are taken out.

656
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:41,957
But you get your good name back.

657
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,550
I'll let you know.

658
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:57,472
- When?
- When I have him.

659
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:29,879
Yes?

660
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,297
Kenneth.

661
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:38,762
He's not available.

662
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:00,246
I'm good.

663
01:20:00,337 --> 01:20:02,202
Just going for a walk.

664
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:58,614
Fuck!

665
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:04,499
Who did I extract in Barcelona?

666
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,168
You mean who did you kill in Dublin?

667
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,629
Tide's coming in.

668
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:12,799
It was a journalist, a dissident.

669
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,546
A dissident journalist,
a scientist, what does it matter?

670
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,380
It mattered to someone. Who?

671
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:24,094
You were excited on the phone.
What do you have?

672
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:27,685
A unique alignment of conditions.

673
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:33,396
I know this man, Jiang,
has been a problem for you,

674
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,607
leaking information and so forth.

675
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,784
Restricting your movements.

676
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:43,580
I also know this Kane girl
is about to leave her employer

677
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:46,659
and take all his business with her.

678
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:49,495
Which he won't survive.

679
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,797
So when I get word that

680
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:54,751
Jiang has been staying
in a safe house in Barcelona,

681
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:58,800
I see an opportunity for everyone

682
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:03,013
to transcend their circumstances.

683
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:09,599
You mean hire the girl to rescue Jiang?

684
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:12,901
And I deliver him to you.

685
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,024
The story will be that she's gone rogue.

686
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:16,775
Sold out on the Barcelona job

687
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,949
and murdered a man
for money at Russborough.

688
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:21,447
Resistance?

689
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,449
He won't be in a position to.

690
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:24,950
Put a bullet in him,

691
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:28,125
plant the broach on him, and then kill her
when you get back to the hotel.

692
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:31,211
- Self-defense.
- Of course.

693
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:39,545
I'm assuming the motive of everyone
involved is strictly professional?

694
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:44,641
Paul, the motive is money.

695
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,969
The motive is always money.

696
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:49,806
What about Kenneth?
Can he guarantee delivery?

697
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,982
It's a two-for-one deal.

698
01:23:52,236 --> 01:23:54,477
You take Jiang out,

699
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:57,438
Kenneth takes the Kane girl out.

700
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,649
T o close the loop.

701
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,608
With no one looking.

702
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,035
Yeah. You're right.

703
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:06,455
She does sound perfect.

704
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,749
You only have to look at her.

705
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,200
What about the girl?

706
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,999
- What about her?
- Can she handle herself?

707
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:17,582
I'm sure you'll cope.

708
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:25,299
I've never done a woman before.

709
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:29,102
You shouldn't think of her
as being a woman.

710
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,350
No, that would be a mistake.

711
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:34,433
What's in this for you?

712
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,693
Besides my money.

713
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:40,025
A new life.

714
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:43,488
And a new wife.

715
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:48,580
That's everything I know.

716
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,283
That's everything I know. That's it.

717
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:02,844
Mallory!

718
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,924
Mallory!

719
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:17,202
Dianna.

720
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,395
Dianna.

721
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:01,497
Shit.
