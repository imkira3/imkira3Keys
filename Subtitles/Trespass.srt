3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,369
[Kyle] I don't understand why we
can 't continue construction.

4
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,363
We could become partners.

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,410
Well, If you finish it, we can sell it.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,130
You're being unreasonable.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,931
Look, you're bleeding us dry!

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,130
Don't twist. Everyone knows real
estate 's in trouble. Come on!

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,170
We sell, everybody wins.

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,561
I-I'll get you
some money.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,247
No, don't hang up.
Goddamit.

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,563
[dialing and ringing]

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,007
Mr. Kaplan,
Kyle Miller again.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,488
Yeah, hi. I'm calling about the
golconda diamond that we discussed.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,121
Well, I have a buyer.
I know we haven't done business before

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,771
but I assure you I can be
an asset to your company.

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,565
Let me show you what I
can do with this stone.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,242
No, I won't take commission. What do you have to lose?
It's my contact and my risk.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,846
I guarantee it's 100% reliable.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,446
If this goes upside down,
it's on me, okay?

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,281
Hang up. Hang up.
I'm calling him now. Thanks.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,091
[metallic clinking]

[engine roars]

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,806
Emile Strewart?
Kyle Miller. How are you?

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,087
[Avery] Hey, Mom, can I go to a party?

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,168
[Sarah] Come on, Avery. Not tonight.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,447
Please?

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,286
It's at this guy Jake's house.
Everyone's going.

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,408
Who's everyone?

30
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,970
Friends from school.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,883
Why are you being so vague about it?

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,645
I'm not. Hang on.
I'm getting water-boarded.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,364
[chuckles]

34
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,044
Please? It's
no big thing.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,441
Yeah? Well, if
it's no big thing,

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,364
why can't you tell me who
you're going with? Hm?

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,569
So, that little daydream we discussed.

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,927
Yes, the flawless one.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,050
Well, it turns out it could
be yours provided that, uh...

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,043
Just a minute.

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,761
Provided that you come up
with a less insulting number.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,083
No, you're gonna have to do a
little bit better than that, Emile,

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,889
or my seller's gonna walk.

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,008
It's just a party.

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,003
With Kendra?

46
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,606
Why do you have such a
problem with Kendra?

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,611
Avery, I just thought we could have dinner at
home tonight as a family. Your Dad's back.

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,444
I thought it'd be nice.

49
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,569
I don't wanna have dinner.
I wanna go to a party.

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,286
Well, I said no.

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,124
[Kyle] Emile. Emile.

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,531
Fine, I'll ask Dad.

53
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,523
Okay. Ask him.

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,127
Emile, Stafford's offering two
percent above your price.

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,647
Yes! That Stafford.
Carl Stafford.

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,328
Mom's being arbitrary and inflexible.

57
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,004
[scoffs] Oh, come on.

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,242
[whispering] I need hugs.

59
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,971
What difference does it make if
Carl said it or he didn't say it?

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,287
The point is you're
getting a damn good rock.

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,567
Uh, just a minute.

62
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,688
Did you wear that to school?

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,205
Can I go to a friend's party?

64
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,726
No.

65
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,842
I have to go with your mother on this.

66
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,570
No! I wanna
meet with you.

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,563
You don't know what we
we're talking about.

68
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,330
Yes. We were
talking about Kendra.

69
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,448
That means boys, probably older,

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,450
and that is every father's worst nightmare.
I'm sorry, Sweetie.

71
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,291
Yes, yes. I'm back.
No, tonight is fine.

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,125
Uh, I could be there
in 30,45 with traffic.

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,771
Whatever you two are going through
treating me like a child,

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,569
isn't gonna make anything any better.

75
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,688
Are we going through something?

76
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,205
I don't know.
Are we?

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,407
Look, I'm sorry about all this.
It's just...

78
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,051
It's just a bit crazy
here at the office today.

79
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,170
Yes. Well, I don't think
you're really hearing me.

80
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,083
Emile, this is the flawless.

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,401
It's whiter than the
snow on Mount Fuji.

82
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,005
Are you cartooning me?
This is a 2A diamond

83
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,970
so clear you will weep.
You will just weep.

84
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,805
I mean, in any other circumstance
a four karat golconda

85
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,201
is 1.5 million dollars.
I mean, this is a steal.

86
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,204
I'm inviting you to steal from me.
Yes, cash.

87
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,681
[muffled voice]
This is a basement price.

88
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,842
I'm not even taking a commission.

89
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,651
No, it has to be cash.

90
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,367
Thank you. Thank you, Emile.
I'm glad we could come to an understanding.

91
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,330
And you won't be
disappointed. Good-bye.

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,209

[Sarah] Kyle?

98
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,448
I'm on the phone.

99
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,650
I just wondered if you wanted
something to eat before you go out.

100
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,842
Uh, no, I'll pick something up.

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,288
[suspenseful music]

102
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,285
Please don't say it's all because you
love me and you're worried about me.

103
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,281
Honey, you have to eat something.

104
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,567
I'm not hungry.

105
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,440
All right.
Well, I'm just gonna leave it here.

106
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,727
It's yummy.

Avery, you're so pretty and
you're so smart and you...

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,004
You just don't have to be
in such a hurry to grow up.

110
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,609
I love you, baby.

111
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,889
I know, Mom.
I love you, too.

Hey.

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,967
They think you're a bad influence.

118
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,088
They're right.

that my mom is having sex
with her divorce lawyer.

122

Do you have his number?
My mom's gonna need one.

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,201
How was Houston?

129
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,966
Just supplying diamonds for oil
men's mistresses. [Scoffs]

130
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,729
How's Avery?

131
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,531
Oh, she's still in her room. [Scoffs]

132
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,290
She hates me.

133
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,842
No, she doesn't hate you.
She hates both of us.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,004
Uh. I found this.

135
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,605
Do you think she's smoking?

136
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,648
I hope not.

137
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,291
It's not just this.
There were cigarettes out by the pool.

138
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,600
Really?

139
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,920
Uh-huh.

140
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm worried about her.

141
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,569
Yeah.

142
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,529
Here.

143
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,524
This guy's only in town tonight, otherwise
the whole deal, just, you know?

144
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,527
You look so beautiful.

145
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,642
I do?

146
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,327
What I do, that I leave,
that I can't always be here,

147
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,482
it's all for you and Avery.

148
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,928
To take care of you.
You know that?

149
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,045
I know.

150
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,487
Hey. Hm?

151
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,722
I have to go.

152
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,201
I wonder how many times
this has to happen before

153
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,888
[sighs] I'm not really
gonna care any more.

Mr. Kyle Miller?

Yes.

Mr. Miller.

160

May we come in to speak with you?

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,724
What's this about?

162
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,246
How many people are at
your house at this time?

163
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,971
My wife and daughter and myself.
Is there a problem, oficer?

164
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,963
Kyle, what's going on?

165
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,168
Sir, we're talking to all
the families in the area

166
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,005
because there 's been
a rash of burglaries.

167
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,082
Get Avery.

168
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,924
Mr. Miller?

169
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,970
Yes, all right. All right.
Just- just a minute.

170
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,206
[suspenseful music]

171
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,648
Avery!

172
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,131
[rattles doorknob] Oh.

173
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,806
Avery, come on, open up.

174
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,207
Avery.
[knocking]

175
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,567
Come on, don't be silly.

176
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,405
Avery! Come on! It's locked!

177
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,087
Well, will you just get her to open it?
I want her down here now.

178
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,527
Yeah. Yeah.
Avery, come on!

179
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,202
[doorbell ringing]

180
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,163
She's gone!

181
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,481
Sarah, run!
Run, Sarah!

182
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,642
[man] Shut the fuck up.

183
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,961
Don't fucking do anything.

184
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,129
Get her!
Get after her!

185
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,771
I'm will put a hole in you.

186
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,850
Don't fucking look at me. Get the cash.

187
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,611
[shrieks]

188
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,204
[starts engine]

189
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,169
[tires screeching]

190
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,924
[shouts and brakes]

191
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,243
[panting]

192
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,524
I told you it was happening.

193
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,489
What is happening is
you almost killed us.

194
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,722
Do not embarrass me and
go acting your age.

195
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,086
What age should do I act?

196
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,525
Legal!

197
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,251
[loud pop music]

198
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,924
What up, ladies?

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,570
I'm glad you all could make it here.

200
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,211
My name is Jake.
Welcome to my party.

201
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,170
Hey, Jake. I, uh,
I invited them. Jake.

202
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,687
Yeah! It's
all cool.

203
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,366
Kendra.
Follow me, please.

204
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,166
I would absolutely love to show you something.
Check this out.

205
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,924
In your fucking knees.

206
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,604
Face down.

207
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,648
[panting]

208
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,767
We need that in case security calls.

209
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,208
Okay. Let's all get really clear
on one thing here. All right?

210
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,045
This is my house now.
It's my house, it's my rules.

211
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,565
Daddy's home!

212
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,324
Kid's gone.

213
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,931
So, do you have any idea where
your underage daughter is

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,207
and when she 's coming back?

215
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,090
No, I don't know.

216
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,845
Don't you just love surprises?

217
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,206
She'll be back.

218
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,887
Hey, 15 minutes.
In and out.

219
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,201
No bullshit.

220
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,527
All right.
Cell phones on the floor, now!

221
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,523
Now! Cell phones!

222
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,726
I don't have one!

223
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,006
Liar!

224
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,326
I don't have one on me.

225
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,890
[man] You don't have one?

226
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,088
All right.
We'll see about that.

227
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,004
Shall we, Sarah? Spread.
Oh, that's a nice ass.

228
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,411
Do not...

229
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,164
No! No! No!

230
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,368
Don't you ever fucking
do that again, Kyle.

231
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,966
If I see a gun, if I see a hand,

232
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,610
I will fucking put a hole in you.

233
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,688
Do I make myself clear, asshole?

234
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,001
Shut the fuck up!

235
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,970
[sighs] They're feisty.

236
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,520
[phone ringing]

237
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,922
Okay. Get that.
Get it.

238
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,004
Kill it.
And the rest, too.

239
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,242
[phone ringing]

240
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,922
All right. Let's
try that alarm now.

241
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,203
After all, we wanna know when
little Avery gets home, right?

242
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,045
You'd be surprised the things
I know about you, Kyle,

243
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,203
and what I don't know,
you're gonna tell me.

244
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,570
Like, what's the alarm code?

245
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,406
What's the alarm code?

246
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,165
[thumps and crashing]

247
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,528
You know, Kyle, I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you.

248
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,921
What did you say the code was?

249
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,002
I can't hear you!
What's the fucking code?

250
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,127
774...

251
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,885
65!
7465!

252
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,770
7465? You sure
about that?

253
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,922
Yes.

254
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,606
All right. You sure about that?
You're sure about that.

255
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,650
I just wanna be sure because we
really, really hate surprises.

256
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,530
7465!

257
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,523
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait! No!

258
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,921
Wait! Wait! Wait!
No! No! What?

259
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,005
What? You hear the cops?
You hear anything? You hear a siren?

260
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,845
I don't hear a siren.
You know why I don't hear a siren?

261
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,526
Because there are
two codes here, Kyle.

262
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,362
One that's real and one that acts
real, only it calls the police!

263
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,324
Now, we happen to know your code.

264
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,046
And we happen to know a
lot about you, Kyle.

265
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,361
Please don't fucking
underestimate us, okay?

266
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,047
Don't waste your time. Get up. See?

267
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,010
This is what we call a
little trust exercise, Kyle.

268
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,004
Now, relationships are
essentially built on trust.

269
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,249
And once that trust is broken,

270
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,006
it's very, very hard to get back.

271
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,003
Isn't that right, Sarah?

272
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,048
What do you want from us?

273
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,044
I don't know. Why don't we
start with everything you got?

274
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,565
[beeping sound]

275
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,251
Old man has no idea I know the combo.

276
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,448
Do you want some blow?

277
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,204
See that?

278
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,362
There's 100K in there
and a stash of cipro

279
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,084
just in case the terrorists

280
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,447
completely destroy
the financial universe

281
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,808
and mail him some anthrax.
It's unbelievable.

282
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,405
You want some of this?

283
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,403
Oh, no. I'm okay.
Just gonna go see

284
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,562
what Kendra 's doing
maybe or something.

285
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,130
Look. I know.

286
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,009
I like you, too. I do.

287
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,091
And I know you just met
me, but I can tell.

288
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,925
You want this.
You do.

289
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,128
And, you know, maybe neither one of us

290
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,965
exactly saw this night
going like this,

291
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,442
but you gotta ask yourself, I mean,

292
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,320
do you really want tonight to
be about what could've been?

293
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,801
Huh?

294
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,611
[chuckling softly]

295
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,728
[dialing]

296
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,529
[woman] Dispatch.

297
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,648
Yeah. I'd
like a taxi.

298
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,449
One moment, please.

299
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,921
Picking up at what address?

300
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,490
Where are you going?

301
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,289
Somewhere I can throw up.

302
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,443
Well... I got
a bathroom.

303
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,484
Watch out for the kid.

304
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,130
Leave me!

305
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,090
Baby, just do what he says, okay?

306
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,601
You know what, Kyle?

307
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,281
Isn't this a little bit obvious?
You have a safe behind your picture.

308
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,169
It's-it's aesthetic.

309
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,924
Aesthetic?

310
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,241
It's not about hiding it from people.

311
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,846
It's a... there's not
a giant safe staring...

312
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,924
Ten minutes.

313
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,890
[whispering] What are we gonna do?

314
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,644
You know, Kyle? I'm impressed with you.

315
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,563
You have a Benelli
pointed at your forehead

316
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,211
and you still have the
audacity to condescend to me.

317
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,968
Your either really, really
stupid or you're suicidal.

318
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,651
Come on, open the safe.

319
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,121
Open the safe.

320
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,043
[sighs]

321
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,610
Open it!

322
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,565
Now, this doesn't have
to be hard, all right?

323
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,122
Just get in there and open the safe.

324
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,602
Hell, you can probably claim
whatever you get in insurance.

325
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,048
You'll get the cash all back, so
it's a win-win situation, right?

326
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,922
Now, the combination.

327
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,571
No.

[cocks rifle]

329
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,800
[scoffs] No?

330
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,247
No.

331
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,209
One "no" is not an option, Kyle.

332
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,968
Please. Don't make us
be obvious about this.

333
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,644
I don't know it!
I don't know it!

334
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,688
What do you expect to find?

335
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,889
We know things about you, okay?
I told you that, asshole!

336
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,804
We saw you sign for diamonds.
Lots of them!

337
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,402
I know you've got diamonds in there
smaller than my pinkie Fingernail

338
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,881
that are worth more than
a Porsche, all right?

339
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,122
I don't give a shit what's in the safe

340
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,124
as long as you fucking open it, so
I'm gonna ask you one more time

341
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,444
really nicely.
Open the goddamn safe, pretty please.

342
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,046
Please. Please! Kyle.

[suspenseful music]

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,204
Who's cutting them?

345

You gotta be kidding me.

346
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,684
These diamonds, who 's cutting them?

347
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,684
Kyle Miller.

348
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,240
You really don't wanna
get smart with me now.

349
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,881
You really wanna stay as
stupid as fucking possible.

350
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,008
I stay stupid, you go to jail.

351
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,971
So, I assume you have someone
to deal with the inscriptions?

352
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,202
Eight. Minutes.

353
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,170
Tell me you thought this through.
You came here to steal diamonds.

354
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,242
You must know something about them.

355
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,527
What does it take to shut
this prick up, Sarah?

356
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,807
Yes, I'll shut up, because
there's another way.

357
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,241
You can learn about the
micro-laser inscriptions

358
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,051
when you're being arrested for
trying to pass off stolen goods.

359
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,884
We're wasting time.
[cocks rifle]

360
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,883
Wait. No. I wanna hear it.
I need to hear it.

361
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,166
No more talking.

362
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,447
No! Don't hurt him!

363
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,569
Anyone with a jeweler's Loupe is gonna
know that the stones are stolen

364
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,369
and who you stole them from.

365
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,562
Every diamond on the market
in the United States

366
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,041
is registered with the Gemological
Institute of America.

367
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,487
The weight, the shape, the grade,

368
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,131
fluorescence and ownership

369
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,686
are documented, filed,
etched into the stone.

370
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,127
You get caught trying
to pass off my diamonds

371
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,841
how soon before they
connect you to my murder?

372
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,843
Open the safe.
No one gets murdered.

373
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,042
Wait. What's he
talking about?

374
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,885
Just-just let him talk.
I need to hear this.

375
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,850
[deep sigh]

376
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,208
The only way to sell stolen
diamonds is to change the shape,

377
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,681
shave off the inscription.

378
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,684
Even so, if you try to sell recur
diamonds without a certificate,

379
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,930
the buyer's gonna know they're stolen,
he's gonna be the bell of your bought.

380
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,482
And yes, yes, there are several
hundred thousand dollars

381
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,843
worth of diamonds in this safe.
But how much do you think a bunch of, you know,

382
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,844
pardon my French, hooligans
are gonna get for them

383
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,646
assuming you can even find a buyer who's
interested in stolen goods to begin with?

384
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,886
Huh? Ten thousand?? I doubt it.
Ten hundred? Maybe. Probably not!

385
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,688
In your hands, they go back
to being nothing but rocks.

386
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,366
Just-just pretty,
shiny little rocks.

387
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,762
[sniffs] So, I'm gonna ask you again.

388
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,763
Who's cutting them for you?

389
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,366
Every minute we stay
past the first 20,

390
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,410
ups our risk 10%, which is

391
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,767
six minutes from right now.

[suspenseful music]

394
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,244
Why are you telling us this?

395
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,886
Because I'm that guy.

396
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,083
I'm the one who can get the stones recut
without anyone tracing them to us.

397
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,806
We'll be partners.
I'll sell the diamonds, give you the cash.

398
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,962
Report them stolen,
claim the insurance.

[panting] Everybody wins
and everybody lives.

400

That is fucking brilliant.

401
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,967
Let me get this straight.
We take the diamonds

402
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,486
and then we give them back to you?

403
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,767
[scoffs] Look.
We do not need this asshole

404
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,243
and whatever bullshit he is selling
because there is cash. Okay?

405
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,087
I don't know how much but it's enough
to give this disk jocky a workout.

406
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,482
It's enough to make us tonight's
fucking lottery winners.

Fuck the diamonds.

get the fuck outta here.

You had your show.
You made your offer.

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,321
I refuse.
Now, open the safe.

413
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,802
You don't have any rope, handcuffs,
nothing to tie us up with.

414
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,405

Please. Open the safe!

They'll kill us, Sarah.
They'll just kill us if I do.

Okay? Trust me, Kyle.

And trust that I will fucking
kill her, right now if you don't!

That lock is the only
reason we're still alive.

I open it, we lose leverage.
We lose leverage, we die.

I want you to look at this
very pretty face here, okay?

Now, can you imagine what
a 125 gram hollow point

is gonna do to this?
It's gonna fucking destroy it, all right?

We are moments away!
How about that for leverage?

This is a negotiation.

but I have the power to make you rich.

drive away and I'll do that.

she's worth it, Kyle?

Now, it's a hell of a kick

You open that big guy up, okay?

479
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,691
I'm gonna stick you with this shit.
You'll fall asleep.

480
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,728
By the time you wake
up, we're in Mexico.

481
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,162
This is all a bad
dream with insurance.

482
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,403
I want you to listen to me,
listen to me really good, okay?

483
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,764
You may have noticed that I don't really
have control over the big guy, okay?

484
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,208
So you have to ask yourself why
I'm gonna bring someone like that

485
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,729
to a job like this.
Maybe I don't have a choice, all right?

486
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,849
Now, I don't wanna
hurt you or your wife.

487
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,241
But he does and he will.

488
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,051
I'm not giving you anything
until after you let her go.

489
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,208
Come on, man, don't
do this to yourself.

490
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,329
[beeping]

491
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,323
Time's up.

492
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,004
[clanking]

493
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,286
[suspenseful music]

494
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,124
Ugh!

495
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,124
[panting]

496
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,808
[groaning]

497
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,689
[shouting]
Kyle! Kyle!

498
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,489
[suspenseful music continues]

499
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,446
Leave her alone!
Leave her the fuck alone.

500
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,130
What the fuck are you doing?

501
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,009
Keep his dirty fucking
hands off of her.

502
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,605
You agreed to shut your mouth.

503
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,569
Please, help me.
Help us.

504
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,689
You told me nobody was gonna touch her.
You promised!

505
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,888
You're gonna shut your fucking mouth.

506
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,291
Did you take your pills?

507
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,328
Yes, I took my fucking pills!

508
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,404
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

509
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,290
[panting] If you touch her,
I will fucking kill you.

510
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,682
[all panting]

511
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,884
F Fuck!

512
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,962
[panting]

513
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,283
[suspenseful music stops]

514
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,126
[panting]

515
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,727
[growling and pounding]

516
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,361
[sobbing, pounding, panting]

517
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,489
[Sarah] Well, the contractor
keeps calling and calling.

518
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,245
I don't know what you
want me to do here, Kyle.

519
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,848
Come one. This is
what you wanted.

520
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,730
I thought we were happier
in the old house.

521
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,485
Don't yell at me.

522
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,809
I was just asking, Kyle. What do you...

523
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,090
[sighs] Okay. Okay.
I'll talk to you later.

524
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,003
Bye.

525
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,366
[eerie music]

526
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,444
[sighs]

527
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,728
[sniffs] Oh.

528
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,689
Um, no, I'm sorry, I...

529
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,366
I couldn't help overhear.

530
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,442
Are you-you okay?

531
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,921
Yeah. Yeah,
yeah, I'm fine.

532
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,684
Okay.

533
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,928
Did you design this whole
place by yourself?

534
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,004
The house? Yeah. I did. [Sniffs]

535
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,731
You are very talented.

536
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,609
Thank you.

537
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,842
It's a little bigger
than we needed, but...

538
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,969
Well, if you're gonna
dream, dream big. Right?

539
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,963
Yeah.

540
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,247
I'm all finished here today, so.

541
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,691
Well, thank you.

542
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,444
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

543
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,841
[crickets chirping]

544
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,842
[eerie music continues]

545
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,691
[footsteps]

546
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,243
[panting]

547
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,810
Take that off!

548
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,484
Oh, did I remind you of someone?

549
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,648
Take it off!

550
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,121
It's not yours.

551
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,407
[provocatively] It is now.

552
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,649
Are you sure this is
the right location?

553
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,802
Uh-huh.

554
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,685
Look, if it's about the money, I'll
take you where you want to go.

555
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,047
No, no, my my house
is right here. I'm fine.

556
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,246
You sure?

557
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,845
Uh-huh. Thank you.

558
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,083
No. No. No.

559
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,401
I'm taking Sarah for a
little walk with me.

560
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,481
No!

561
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,925
Sarah!

562
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,081
Kyle!

563
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,810
Come with me.

564
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,325
[Sarah] Help!

565
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,369
You know, you don't see a lot of
biometrics on home security systems.

566
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,970
Fingerprint scanner?

567
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,008
Ugh.
[thump]

568
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,129
[suspenseful music]

569
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,729
You know, you're gonna put your thumb
on that thing sooner or later.

570
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:25,169
The only question is, whether it
will still be attached to your body.

571
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,290
[suspenseful music]

572
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,364
Serve me.
Serve me.

573
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,171
Pour me some wine.
I want you to serve me.

574
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,129
Would you serve me?

575
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,562
Would you serve me?

576
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,449
Like you served my baby brother?

577
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,965
[panting] Huh?

578
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,884
Yes, you recognized
him. I saw you.

579
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,246
[panting] No.

580
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,560
Yes.

581
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,404
No, I didn't.

582
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,482
Drop the fucking thing.
Don't even try.

583
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,245
Drop the fucking knife or I'll
bite your fucking ear off.

584
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,288
You know why we're here, Sarah,

585
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,488
because you fucked around
with my little brother.

586
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,729
And for that reason, I have to tell
you something. You're gonna die.

587
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,447
And I think you know deep down
inside you that you deserve to die.

588
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,091
And I need you to tell
me "I deserve to die."

589
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,685
You go to hell.

590
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,967
Not go to hell, Sarah.
Not go to hell.

591
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,202
I'm not doing this for me, Sarah.

592
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,802
It's for you. There's a reason they
send priests to guys on death row.

593
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,084
It's their last chance for moral clarity.
Let's get really clear on one thing here.

594
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,004
Only you can save your husband

595
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,527
and your little girl.
We will come back for your little fucking girl

596
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,127
and she doesn't deserve
to die, does she?

597
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,283
No. No.

598
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,648
So, I need you to say it.

599
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,210
[sobbing] What?

600
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,285
I need you to say it. I deserve...

601
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,203
[panting] I..

602
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,441
[whispering] Say it.

603
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,171
Say it.

604
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,083
I..

605
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,767
deserve

606
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,084
[whispering]
to die. Say it, Sarah.

607
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,130
[loud] I deserve

608
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,884
[whispering] to die.

609
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,964
[panting]

610
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,647
Good girl.
Good girl.

611
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,281
Now, you're gonna help
me get that money, okay?

612
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,600
How do I do that?

613
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,762
I think you'll find a way.

614
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,605
And I will make sure that your husband

615
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,321
and your little girl are taken care of.
And they will never have to know...

616
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,890
You promise?

617
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,928
Yes. And I think
you'll find a way

618
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,209
'cause I think you know your
way around men, don't you?

619
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,089
Now, you come with me.

620
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,369
I'd prefer not to make a mess.

621
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,720
But I do when I have to.

622
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,689
Nothing personal.

623
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,569
I'm a collector, you see?

624
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,642
I'm here to collect on a debt.

625
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,051
Ugh!

626
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,884
Ah!
[thump]

627
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,610
Hey, I don't owe you anything.

628
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,001
Who said it was your debt?

629
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,161
[Kyle]
Sarah! Sarah!

630
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,368
No. Kyle. Yeah.

631
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,841
[panting]

632
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,810
[man downstairs]
Tell me where they are.

633
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,410
Tell me where they are!

634
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,369
Mom? Mom?

635
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,090
[Kyle shouting] Run, Avery!

636
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,525
[Kyle] Run, Avery!

637
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,649
Avery!

638
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,809
[intense suspenseful music]

639
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,244
[shouts]

640
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,962
Shit.

641
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,290
Where did you go? Huh?
Where did you go? Sweetie?

642
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,249
Did we scare you?

643
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,800
[footsteps]

644
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,087
I promise we won't hurt you.

645
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,082
Where the fuck are you?

646
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,370
[shouting]

647
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,771
All right.
Come on.

648
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,205
[Avery shouting] No!

649
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,126
Avery! Avery!
Oh, my God!

650
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,000
Avery! You shit
fucking animals!

651
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,048
[crying]

652
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,724
[groaning]

653
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,404
[Sarah] It's all right.

654
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,050
Sweetie.

655
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,248
[sobbing] Dad.

656
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,405
[Sarah groaning]
Av... Avery.

657
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,482
[panting]

658
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,609
It's all right, baby.
It's all right. I got you.

659
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,163
[Avery sobbing]

660
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,208
[Sarah and Avery crying]

661
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,965
Okay, man. Okay, okay. Hey. Hey.

662
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,849
You know what? You did good. All right?

663
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,002
You did good.
You held your ground.

664
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,681
Now it's just your bad luck that
your little girl showed up, okay?

665
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,331
I'm glad that you feel
this way, though.

666
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,402
Now you know how I feel, man.

667
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,443
I'm a family man, too, okay?

668
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,409
That's why we're here.

669
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,767
My Mom...

670
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,968
My Mom got herself beat up every night

671
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,611
by her drunken, asshole husband.

672
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,251
Because she thought that
if she was getting beat up,

673
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,163
we weren't getting beat up.

674
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,766
And she got beat and she
got beat and she got beat

675
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,922
until she got renal failure.

676
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,324
You know what that means?
She needs a new fucking kidney, Kyle,

677
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,970
which is where you come in.

678
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,122
I got a broker that's gonna get us one

679
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,249
but it's gonna cost us
$180,000, all right?

680
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,325
So, I have a choice.
I have to leave here with a $180,000

681
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,048
or a new kidney, and I don't care
which, but I have to tell you, man,

682
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,249
the younger the kidney, the better.

683
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,765
You're full of shit.

684
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,968
No, I'm not, man.
Why do you think

685
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,125
I brought the guy with the
knife and the tranquilizer?

686
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,005
Now, for her sake

687
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,242
I'm gonna ask you one more time

688
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,529
open the fucking safe.

689
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,449
Open the safe.

690
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,045
[suspenseful music]

691
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,565
No!

692
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,371
Motherfucker!
You're a motherfucker!

693
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,081
I'll shoot you up with this
and you'll never wake up.

694
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,447
Isn't that what you said?
So you let my daughter go.

695
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,205
I swear to God I'm gonna do it.

696
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,681
[man] Somebody shoot her!

697
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,003
Five! Go away. Come on, let her go.

698
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,923
You're all gonna fucking die with me.

699
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,526
Come on, Avery.
Go on. Two!

700
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,683
[Avery shouting]

701
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,046
[sobbing]

702
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,686
No one's killing your girl.

703
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,047
Nobody's killing her.

704
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,010
[Sarah] Avery get up.
Come on, you gotta run. Run!

705
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,162
Don't you fucking touch her!

706
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,050
Kyle! Run!

707
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,326
What the fuck are you doing?

708
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,811
What needs to be done.

709
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,723
Avery, baby, I need you to run.

710
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,167
Run, baby. Run
as fast as you can.

711
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,571
Go! Go!

712
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,125
I can't, Mom.

713
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,487
You can do it.
You can do it, baby.

714
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,365
Run! Run!

715
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,126
Now, drop the needle, open the safe,

716
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,567
or I bring her back.

717
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,324
Open it, Kyle.

718
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,686
Sarah...

719
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,843
Open the safe!

720
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,244
Do it! Or we can all die because
I don't give a fuck anymore!

721
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,881
[suspenseful music]

722
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,365
A Ha boy.

[beep]

725
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,841
Let go.

726
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,445
No!

727
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,045
[Elias] No, no, no, no, no!

728
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,691
No fucking way, you motherfucker!

729
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,491
You motherfucker!
Where is it?

730
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,043
[Elias] Shut up. Shut up.
Just shut the fuck up!

731
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,924
[all shouting]

732
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,162
Where is it, baby?
You said...

733
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,651
Shut up!

734
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,850
Okay, let me think.
Let me think.

735
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,725
Kyle, put your hand against the wall.

736
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,003
Ah! Oh, fuck!

737
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,366
No! No!

738
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,329
[Sarah]
No! Get off!

739
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,323
[Kyle shouting in pain]

740
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,006
[woman] Damn you!

741
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,844
[Kyle] Fuck!

742
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,809
It's the second time
you lied to me, Kyle...

743
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,043
There's not gonna be a third time.
Where's the money?

744
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,361
[panting]

745
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,886
I have no money.

746
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,325
Bullshit.

747
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,448
Fuck that.
Where's the stuff?

748
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,206
I put it all in my house, in my family.

749
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,171
No, no, no, no! No fucking way
he spent all of that. Okay?

750
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,084
That was too much fucking cash, Kyle!
I saw...

751
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,650
I got it, I got it! I got it!

752
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,882
Where's the fucking money?

753
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,486
[groaning] There is no fucking money.

754
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,450
Everything is mortgaged.
It's all borrowed.

755
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,251
We never owned this house-
It owned us! We 're broke...

756
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,527
Bullshit!! Bullshit!!

757
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,246
It was a family business.
I'm not family. Honey, they fired me.

758
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,051
They found someone
that could do it cheaper.

759
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,966
I-I was just trying to save something
before the bank took it all.

760
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,280
No. No.
I saw you!

761
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,084
Yeah, we saw you, asshole!

762
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,367
Yeah, you saw me, fucker!
I mean, I just drive

763
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,047
and hustle and drive and
try to make some money.

Oh.

What's all
this, then? Huh?

773
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,523
What's all this?

774
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,602
Where's the money, Kyle?

775
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,287
Oh, my God! I have no money.
I have no money!

776
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,489
Hey! These are diamonds.

777
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,082
Each one of these is a diamond, so
you're gonna tell me where they are.

778
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,561
Have a look at it.
Tell me where they are!

779

How am I supposed to read
without my glasses, asshole?

Where is it? Hm?

Where is the money?

782
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,167
You tell me where each of these are!

783
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,049
Uh, this one's in Houston, I think.

784
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,364
Sarah. Sarah.
I'm not asking for me, okay?

785
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,647
I am asking for us.

786
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,406
Uh, Albany, maybe... I don't know!
I don't have these!

787
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,610
I never owned them!
I'm a middle man living on credit.

[woman] Baby, what's he talking about?
What are we gonna do?

789
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,644
You! You are a fucker!

790
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,645
You said that there was millions here.
This is your fault!

791
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,042
Fucking amateurs.
Look what I found, huh?

792
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,521
No!

[sobbing] Baby, baby, did they hurt you?

794
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,563
What the hell has she got
to do with any of this?

795
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,642
Well, yeah. What do you call it?

796
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,563
You call it leverage, right?

797
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,803
If it's a kidney you want,
then take mine, ass fuck!

798

Kyle!

799
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,087
Really? You're
really ready?

800
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,527
Yeah. Do it, shithole!

801
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,526
You ready for that?
Now this knife,

00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,365
does it have to be
sterilized or is it good?

803
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,841
You might want to turn away.
Get some ice!

804
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,526
Okay. That's the way
you want it, yuppie.

805
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,840
Are you...

806

Ugh.

807

Don't look,

808
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,403
Okay, the kidney's on this side, right?
Brace yourself.

00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,809
You thought I want your kidney?

813
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,884
My Mom, she died because
she was a fat ass drunk.

814
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,123
It's okay. It's okay.
[phone ringing]

815
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,928
I'm still here.

816
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,844
I don't know.
Let me ask him.

817
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,649
How're we doing?

818
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,484
Under control.

819
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,884
It's under control.
That's what Elias says...

820
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,810
We'll be there.

821
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,567
You got an hour.

822
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,405
[woman] No. No. No, no, no, no.

Look at it. They're fucking rich.
You're lying!

00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,527
You are lying!

827
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,202
Get that girl under control.

828
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,442
You said you have
things under control?

829
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,922
Get it under control.

830
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,290
[panting] We're not the
only hostages here.

It's not... You're not
fucking helping me.

839
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,441
Baby, there's a fucking car.
It's a Porsche.

840
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,443
We can get money for the Porsche.

841
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,126
What are we gonna do with it?
Have a fucking yard sale?

842
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,969
I don't know, baby.
I'm really scared.

843
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,804
I just wanna get out of here.

844
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,201
I wanna go, too.
But you're safer here with me.

845
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,123
They can't get you
here. All right?

846
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,009
Tye is gonna fucking kill you.

847

Don't worry about
Tye. I got Tye.

848

Please. You can't
die on me, okay?

849
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,728
I'm not gonna die.
Do I look like I'm gonna die?

850
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,444
I'm not gonna fucking die.

I don't know what I'll
do without you, baby.

852
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,406
Please, this is fucking wrong.
Let's just go.

853
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,881
We can be in Mexico.
At least, we can, we can...

No, man.
No one's running.

You promised me.
We had a deal.

We had a deal.
You would let my family go.

No. You
stay here.

On your knees.

964
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,321
[soft music, birds chirping]

965
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,170
[buzz]

966
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,005
You're a stupid asshole, you
brought this on yourself.

967
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,367
I didn't want it
like this. Okay?

968
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,124
So you can save yourselves,

969
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,447
but how much do you care
about your daughter?

970
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,806
You can still save her.

971
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,370
I told you.
We have nothing.

972
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,885
Okay.
[cocks gun]

973
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,689
That's the way you wanna play it.

974
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,410
I'm gonna take the necklace.

975
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,482
I'm gonna leave three bodies.

976
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,646
If you're gonna kill me, why don't you
fucking look me in the eye, you coward!

977
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,609
It's fake.

978
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,045
Come again?

979
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,841
The necklace.
It's fake.

980
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,003
The stones are cubic zirconia.

981
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,606
Ninety-nine bucks a pop
on the shopping network.

982
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,569
[whispering] Bullshit.

983
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,571
Fuck you.

984
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,442
Are you okay?

985
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,808
Don't fucking worry
about me, honey, okay?

986
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,202
You sure? Because I know where
my Mom hides the Vicodin.

987
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,962
Do you expect me to believe

988
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,202
that you bought your wife fakes?

989
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,002
I sold the real ones.
That's a copy.

990
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,482
Do you know anything

991
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,366
about the etymology
of the word "diamond?"

992
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,290
Why don't you educate me, asshole?

993
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,724
It comes from the Greek
adamas meaning "unbreakable"

994
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,247
'cause real ones are so hard

995
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,927
they won't break.

996
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,484
They won't break.

997
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,130
All right.

998
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,929
[cocks gun] We're done.

999
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,526
No!
[gunshot]

1000
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,083
Hey, man, it's still my show!

1001
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,083
It's still my show.

1002
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,448
Then wrap it up.

1003
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,169
Does that look like the hardest
substance in the world to you?

1004
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,887
[chuckles]

1005
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,804
You know what?
This doesn't save you.

1006
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,048
Hey, Kyle.

1007
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,006
You know, your loving wife,
she fucked my baby brother.

1008
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,367
That's why we're here.

1009
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,920
That's why we picked you.
[chuckles softly]

1010
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,368
[clicking tongue]

1011
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,240
Kyle, he's lying.
Look at me.

1012
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,242
It's up there.
You want me to get it?

1013
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,483
What? And untie you?
How dumb do you think I am, huh?

1014
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,645
[shouting and crashing]

1015
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,563
[shouting]

1016
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,450
Stupid bitch!
You fucking bitch!

1017
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,851
Get that tweaking bitch.

1018
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,010
[alarm going]

1019
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,727
[alarm continues]

1020
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,525
[beeping]

1021
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,729
Ugh.

1022
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,765
I'm getting a lot of money to do this.

1023
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,285
And you...

1024
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,203
[bones cracking] Ah!

1025
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,443
You, I'm gonna do it for free.
You, I'm gonna enjoy.

1026
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,887
Ah!

1027
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,965
[alarm continues, phone ringing]

1028
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,530
[alarm stops]

1029
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,844
[phone ringing]

1030
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,730
[phone continues ringing]

1031
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,688
Hello?

1032
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,411
[woman] Good evening, sir.
This is Guardalert Security.

1033
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,721
Uh, we're gonna have to call you back.

1034
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,010
Am I talking now,
Kyle? Huh?

1035
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,686
Huh? No more
bullshit, Kyle?

1036
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,489
I don't hear you talking.

1037
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,688
[suspenseful music]

1038
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,521
You know what else they use
that needle for? Huh? Huh?

1039
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,206
Lethal injection. Yeah.

1040
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,080
See? It paralyzes you
but you stay conscious.

1041
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,527
Eventually, [spits]

1042
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,887
your lungs collapse and you die.

1043
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,883
[panting] Before that happens,

1044
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,363
you're gonna get to watch me
slice you to little pieces.

1045
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,729
[both grunting]

1046
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,167
[grunting]

1047
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,971
[grunting]

1048
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,167
[coughing]

1049
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,165
[fixed phone ringing]

1050
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,445
Good evening, sir, this is Kyle
with Guardalert Security.

1051
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,410
We have an indication there's an
alarm incident at your residence.

1052
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,609
I think you have the wrong number.
This is the Miller's residence.

1053
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,008
I need to speak to either Kyle,
Sarah or Avery Miller right away.

1054
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,162
Hang on a sec.

1055
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,288
[suspenseful music intensifying]

1056
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,249
[shouting]

1057
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,560
Get up.

1058
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,851
Don't fuck with me.

1059
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,730
[Kyle] Drop the gun.

1060
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,167
How about you
drop the gun? Hm?

1061
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,362
You, too, sweetie.

1062
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,011
Except that's not even a nail
gun until it's turned on.

1063
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,162
[panting]

1064
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,210
Yeah, sorry about that.
Who did you say you were looking for?

1065
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,329
Sir, I've alerted
the local authorities.

1066
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,925
No, no, no.
Hang on. Hang on.

1067
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,764
Avery, can you talk to this woman?

1068
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,923
It's something about your alarm.

1069
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,321
Yeah, hi, this is Avery.

1070
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,085
Hi. You having a bit of
a party there tonight?

1071
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,243
Yeah, um, sorry.

1072
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,561
That was Brad and he's
emotionally retarded.

1073
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,768
How can I help you?

1074
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,201
Well, your alarm went off
so I need you to provide me

1075
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,090
with the password to this account.

1076
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,767
If for any reason you feel
like you can't speak...

1077
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,969
No, no, um, um, it's-it's "diamond."

1078
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,646
[suspenseful music]

1079
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,246
That's right, isn't it?

1080
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,403
Yes. Yes, it is.

1081
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,483
[screams]

1082
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,722
Patrol cars have been
dispatched to your location.

1083
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,087
The officers will need to verify...

1084
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,289
No. Please don't do that.
My parents have no idea I'm having this thing.

1085
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,045
If they find out, um, I'm dead.

1086
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,488
I mean, this is my first party here,

1087
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,406
and-and we're gonna clean
up and everything.

1088
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,484
And you have the password, okay?

1089
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,008
Okay?

1090
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,525
Okay? Please?

1091
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,126
Sure. Sure. Okay.

1092
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,841
I'll let it go this time, honey.

1093
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,684
Have a good time.

1094
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,841
Thank you.

1095
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,602
You're a smart girl.
Okay.

1096
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,282
Let's start over.

1097
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,284
[gunshot] Oh!

1098
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,567
Oh, my God!

1099
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,770
No! Stay there, dammit!
I'm fucking sick of you yelling all the time!

1100
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,411
Shut up, Sarah!
Shut up!

1101
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,609
It's your fucking fault!
I got it. I got it, bro. Okay?

1102
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,523
Just trust me for a fucking moment.

1103
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,602
Everyone just shut the fuck up!

1104
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,480
And let me concentrate for a minute.

1105
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,164
Avery, shut up.

1106
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,244
We're just gonna sit for a minute.

1107
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,049
[suspenseful music]

1108
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,361
You know what? When I was a little boy,

1109
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,522
you know what my mom used to say to me?

1110
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,251
I'd get these headaches.
I'd be screaming and she would say,

1111
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,449
"Elias, would you shut up?
You're taking all the air out of the room.

1112
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,126
Air that other people could
be doing good things with."

1113
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,089
I was never any good at anything.

1114
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,049
I mean, I had a few jobs, you know,

1115
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,804
nothing that stuck, though.

1116
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,521
Avery, quiet, okay?
Daddy needs to concentrate.

1117
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,649
[Avery crying]

1118
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,567
There was one thing I was good at.
Selling dope, okay?

1119
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,880
When I had the product,

1120
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,486
[pops] everything worked.

1121
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,803
I was so good at it, man, that they
decided they were gonna front me

1122
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,123
$180,000 worth.

1123
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,728
When they said that, I thought,
hey, this is too much, man.

1124
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,646
I can't handle this.
But then I thought about it.

1125
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,331
I figured, fuck it, man.

1126
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,928
The world's been against
me my whole life.

1127
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,641
It's time I back myself and my girl.

1128
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,121
Hey, buddy.

1129
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,690
I want you to listen to me

1130
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,922
because I'm telling you a story.

1131
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,331
[sighs]

1132
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,004
See? Somebody
jacked my shit.

1133
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,082
$180,000 worth.

1134
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,083
[general shouting]

1135
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,645
[Petal] No, no, no.

1136
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,326
No. No.

1137
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,926
Hundred an eighty.
That's a whole lot of money you owe.

1138
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,850
Yeah. We're
getting it.

1139
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,450
How?

1140
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,206
Never mind how. Okay?
We're getting it.

1141
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,851
He has a pretty face.

1142
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,845
It would be a shame to
cut up a face like that.

1143
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,968
And there's some of us, you know,

1144
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,247
we can't turn around and just say,

1145
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,961
"Hey, man, I'm sorry. I'd love to pay
you back but I'm bankrupt, bro."

1146
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,169
Which is why they sent
the big guy along.

1147
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,084
Because I owe his boss a lot of money.

1148
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,367
So, guess who they're
gonna blame for that?

1149
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,205
You know, it's really bad
mojo to cut the tax man.

1150
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,681
So I'll tell you what, man.

1151
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,808
Get me some cash.

1152
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:55,123
And then we'll get this thing seen to.
All right?

1153
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:05,521
[whispering] I'm-I'm worth
more dead than alive.

1154
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,521
Baby, look.

1155
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,481
I guess I'm not the only one
you've been holding out on, huh?

1156
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,450
You knew all along about my
baby brother and your wife.

1157

[mobile phone ringing]

1158
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,927
Hey. No.
No, it's me, man.

1159
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,925
Well, he-he can't come
to the phone right now.

1160
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,890
I'm getting your goddamn
money, that's what I'm...

1161
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,770
Yeah. Okay.

1162
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,923
No, I'm sorry.
I'll-I'll be there.

1163
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,843
I'll be there.

1164
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,924
Hey, man.

1165
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,281
[sighs] I'm sorry.

1166
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,931
How's that leg doing? [Sniffs]

1167
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,923
I'm sorry about this.

1168
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,480
Looks like you had enough
problems before we came.

1169
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,803
You know, you're not the
only one bleeding, man.

1170
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,283
You could have saved us
all this fucking hassle.

1171
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,169
No!

1172
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,208
Stay away, you whore!

1173
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,770
[Avery crying]

1174
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,490
[both grunting]

1175
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,964
Back off.
Back off.

1176
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,849
You're a coward.
You know that?

1177
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,002
You're a fucking coward
and you are fucked up!

1178
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,003
What the fuck did you expect?

1179
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,527
Look. Look around you.
Could this be any more fucked up?

1180
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,965
Oh, yeah.
It could be, man.

1181
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,844
Like if someone was here,

1182
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,526
if someone was here for
something other than money.

1183
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,967
What does that mean? Huh?
What does that mean?

1184
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,530
You're not even supposed to be here...

1185
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,011
[Elias] No, you're not coming.

1186
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,367
Why the hell I'm not?

1187
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,046
You can go somewhere and get
yourself seen by a lot of people

1188
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,770
and I'll call you afterwards.

1189
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,491
How about I save you
the trouble of calling?

1190
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,807
I'm here for the same
reasons and you know that.

1191
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,689
You're not taking your medications.

1192
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,524
What?

1193
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,127
You're not taking your medications.

1194
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,725
Medication.

1195
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,406
That trick again?
Let me look at that.

1196
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,686
Don't...

1197
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,728
Mm.

1198
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,361
[spits] Man, you have
an asshole of a doctor.

Stay here.

1202
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,003
Hey, it's a little late for
house calls, don't you think?

1203
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,402
I apologize, Mr. Miller.
It's Officer Kelly, from Guardalert.

1204
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,289
We had an alarm incident earlier.

1205
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,124
Oh, yeah, yeah!
That was my daughter.

1206
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,282
She had some people
over without asking us.

1207
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,443
We worked it out.
She 's being punished.

1208
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,488
Let me assure you.

1209
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,086
Sorry, but the police
summons was canceled.

1210
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,242
As a matter of Guardalert's protocol,

1211
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,085
I just-I need a signature
from a family member.

1212
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,691
How about we just all
get some sleep, huh?

1213
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,762
I mean, thanks for stopping by.

1214
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,444
I will have to notify the police.

1215
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,887
Give me a sec.

1216
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,606
Kyle, I love you.

1217
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,251
I love you.

1218
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,606
It doesn't matter.

1219
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,889
You have to know, this is...

1220
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,928
It doesn't matter.

Believe me, please.

Look, I'm sorry to trouble you.

1225
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,448
I just need a signature
from a family member.

1226
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,648
Yeah, it's no problem.

1227
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,769
I'm just sorry you had to come all
the way out here for nothing.

1228
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,923
Where do I sign?

You fucking psycho!

Look at yourself. Huh?
Tell me who the psycho is.

Me or the guy talking to a rent-a-cop
with blood all over your face?

Get the fuck outta here.

Are you seriously buying this?

01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,282
Honey. You rich people,
you don't smoke.

1279
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,683
Sarah, you don't need to worry.

1280
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,047
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1281
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,282
I will take care of you and Avery.

1282
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,364
Okay? The way

He 's right.

1286
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,721
Come on, you don't really believe...

1287
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,565
That you're a part of this?
That I'm a cuckold? What?

1288
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,405
That your filthy lust
invited them in? What?

1289
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,881

Excuse me.
What are you doing?

01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,647
What are you doing?

1298
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,044
You need to get your things.
You need to leave.

1299
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,965
No.

1300

You have to go.

1306

Please! Please.
I asked you to leave.

1308
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,206
I need you
to go. Please.

1309
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,924
Really? Is that
what you want

1310
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,889
or what you just you
think you should say?

1311
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,883
What are you talking about?

1312
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,564
This is good. Okay?

1313
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,449
No, this is insane.
Please leave.

1314
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,806
Be honest with yourself.

1315
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,484
I am honest, I...

1316
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,927
We could be so fucking good together.

1317
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,402
No. I'm gonna call your supervisor
if you don't get out right now.

1318
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,608
I'm gonna call him and tell
him what you're doing.

1319
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,762
You don't need to.

1320
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,207
Please. Come on.
You're scaring me.

1321
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,805
I need you to leave.

Listen, you do not have to be unhappy.

1323
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,246
I'm not unhappy, I...

1324
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,325
I love my husband and I want
you to get out of my house.

1325
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,680
Okay.

1326
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,364
Get your stuff and leave.

1327
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,771
I will go.

1328
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,922
Oh, God, please don't touch me.

1329
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,446
You know I'm right.

1330
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,128
Do you love her?

1331
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,491
And she loves me.

1332
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,767
Well, good.
Because that stuff

1333
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,042
your brother was gonna
shoot her up with?

1334
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,964
They use it for executions.
Did you know that?

1335
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,886
Yeah. Yeah. That was the plan.
To execute her.

1336
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,124
So if you love her, take her,
find Avery and get out of here

1337
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,770
before that jackass kills her!

1338
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,810
Baby, you know you can do this, right?

1339
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,483
I'm gonna take you to Mexico.

1340
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,801
And we're, we're gonna get her...

1341
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,724
We're gonna her out of foster
care, I'm gonna marry you,

1342
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,564
and what are you gonna do?

1343
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,244
You're gonna get clean, baby.

1344
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,970
[whining] I'm gonna get clean.

1345
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,925
But if it turns out that this party's
bullshit, what are you gonna do?

1346
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,682
I'm gonna kill her.

1347
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,601
I would never...

1348
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,883
Never leave Avery, I know, which is why
you have to go with him now and get her.

1349
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,370
Sarah, come on.
Sarah. Sarah. Come on.

What are you waiting for? Go. Go.

So what's your little plan, princess?

1358
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,050
This guy wants to have sex with me.

1359
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:38,170
And he's gonna pay 100K just
for that little privilege?

1360
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,244
You think you're worth that, huh?

1361
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,846
Do you think you're worth
that much more than me?

1362
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,490
You know my plan, huh?
You wanna know my plan?

1363
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,846
Stop it.
Stop it.

1364
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,649
I'm gonna go in there

1365
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,326
and I'm gonna blow
everybody's brains out.

Off with their fucking heads.

1369
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,441
Then I'm gonna take that cash
money and I'm gonna turn around

1370
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,602
and I'm gonna blow that smug

You know what you are
gonna do about it?

1373
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:20,486
You're gonna do shit!
Because you can't do shit, can you?

01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,210
You can't do shit, can you?

What the fuck did you do that for?

You can't fucking hurt my brother.

Why are you protecting him, man?

1391

He's the reason you're in this mess.

That's right.

01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,049
Not before I kill one of your parents.

1439
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:53,808
So which one 's it gonna be?
Huh ? Who?

1440
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,724
I'll tell you what I'll
choose for ya. Mommy.

1441
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,007
[gunshot]

1442
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,481
[loud thump]

1443
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,007
Oh, fuck.

1444
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,890
You see, Sarah,

1445
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,291
he didn't love you.

1446
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:29,409
He knew you'd leave him for me.

1447
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:32,927
Right? He saw divorce
and decided to cash out.

1448
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,809
Why, Kyle?

1449
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,451
You were just gonna cry poor

1450
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,528
and screw your family in a settlement?

1451
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,924
I was saving it for my family.

1452
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,643
Something the bank
c-couldn't take.

1453
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,770
It's the money from the necklace.

1454
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:58,846
I hid it to get us out of this.

1455
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,002
Oh, well, thank you.

1456
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,003
Thank you, for all of it.

1457
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,367
Sarah, do you wanna help
me with this cash?

1458
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,930
Huh?

1459
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,003
What? Kyle.

1460
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,321
Run.

1461
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,482
No. No. No!

1462
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,846
[Kyle] Run.

1463
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,685
Kyle. Kyle, no!
Kyle!

1464
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,125
[Avery] We gotta go.

1465
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,680
[Sarah]
No! Kyle!

1466
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,081
Sarah! Sarah!

1467
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,043
Take Avery.

1468
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:38,731
Kyle! Kyle!

1469
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,564
Avery, I said run now!

1470
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,203
Sarah!

1471
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,329
Run, Mom, please.

1472
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,004
Avery.

1473
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,923
Come on.

1474
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,161
[shooting]

1475
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,242
[growling]

1476
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,322
Leave

1477
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,526
my family

1478
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,681
[growling]

1479
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,489
alone.

1480
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,761
Oh!
[growling]

1481
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,731
No! No!

1482
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,882
Get out of the way.

1483
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,531
You're gonna have to shoot me.

1484
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,524
I would-I would never hurt you.
I love you.

1485
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,082
If you love me, give me the gun.

1486
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,203
Help me.

1487
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,045
Help me.
Help me.

1488
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,041
[panting]
Give me the gun! Please.

1489
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,361
Jonah.

1490
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,051
I knew that you would
come back for me.

1491
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,610
Yeah.

1492
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,887
Yeah. That's right.

1493
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:57,567
I love you.
Come on.

1494
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:01,964
Give it to me.
It's fine. Yeah.

1495
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,684
I'll help you.

1496
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,330
You're a liar!

1497
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,721
You're just trying to protect him!

1498
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,921
If I'm dying, you are coming with me.

1499
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,968
Okay? We
belong together.

1503
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,763
Ah!

[screaming]

1505
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,530
I'm sorry.

1506
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,921
[groaning]

1507
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,331
Your necklace...

1508
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,643
No, it doesn't
matter. Please.

1509
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:07,122
I had insurance for when I'm gone.

1510
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,646
You're not going anywhere.

1511
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,722
We need you.

1512
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,723
I need you.

1513
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,561
I need you.

[approaching sirens]

Mom! They're
coming. Dad!

1516
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:26,409
It's all right. Mom!
They're coming. They're coming.

1517
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,165
They're coming, Dad.
You're gonna be okay.

They're here.
