1
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,650
Apollo is saying "Come on! "

2
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,650
Apollo is going right.

3
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,650
Now he's gone for the left.

4
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,650
He's going for another right... another right.

5
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,660
Down on one knee.

6
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,650
Lou Filippo in there wiping off the glove.

7
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,670
Aii right, a left and a right combination.

8
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,660
What is keeping him up, Bill? I don't know.

9
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,680
He can't even get his gioves up to protect himself.

10
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,680
Down! Down! Stay down!

11
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,670
Apollo's dancing around with his arms in the air.

12
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:44,690
Five...Six...seven...eight...

13
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,690
nine....

14
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,700
Come on.

15
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,690
Apollo can't believe it!

16
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,710
He got a left to the ribs, his right ribs

17
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,720
You okay, champ?

18
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,720
I'm okay.

19
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,720
He broke my ribs!

20
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,730
I can't see nothing. You gotta open my eye.

21
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,730
Cut me, Mick. But I don't want to.

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,720
Try anything. Cut it.

23
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,740
You're bleeding inside, champ. I'm gonna stop the fight.

24
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,740
You ain't stopping nothing, man!

25
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,730
You stop this fight, I'll kill you!

26
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,750
I'll kill you!

27
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,730
You gotta get him down within the body.

28
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,740
There is the bell for the 15th and final round.

29
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,760
You better start fighting.

30
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,760
You're doing nothing.

31
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,750
They look like they've been in a war, these two.

32
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,770
Apollo, the champion, really tagged him.

33
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,760
And Apollo clearly protecting his right side, his ribs.

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,770
look at that!

35
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,770
Belly punches!

36
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,770
Hard left and right!

37
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,780
look at the blood coming out.He's spltting out blood now.

38
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,780
A left

39
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,780
and he's already using his right hand.

40
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,790
Go for it! Go for it, Rocky!

41
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,790
listen to this crowd. A left to the ribs. Another to the ribs.

42
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,790
That left hand again, that left hand!

43
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,790
Right to the chin! He's got him up against the ropes.

44
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,790
Apollo, the champion

45
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,780
Ain't gonna be no rematch!

46
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,790
Don't want one!

47
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,810
You went the distance. You went the 15 rounds!

48
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,810
How do you feel?

49
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,810
Adrian

50
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,810
What did you think when it was the 15th round and you came out?

51
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,810
Rocky!

52
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,820
Ladies and gentlemen

53
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,820
Attention please.

54
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,810
Rocky!

55
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,820
we have had the privilege of witnessing the greatest

56
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,810
exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring!

57
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,820
Adrian

58
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,830
Rocky!

59
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,820
ladies and gentlemen, we have a split decision!

60
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,840
Adrian Rocky.

61
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,830
Eight for Apollo Creed!

62
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,840
Adrian

63
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,840
Those fans out there deserve a rematch.

64
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,850
Are you ready for it? !

65
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,850
Ain't gonna be a rematch!

66
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,840
I had enough things in my face tonight!

67
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,840
Rocky! That's my friend,

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,840
Rocky.

69
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,850
You're breaking this jacket!

70
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,840
Paulie!

71
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,850
Adrian! Rocky!

72
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,850
Where's your hat?

73
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,860
I love you! I love you!

74
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,860
I love you!

75
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,860
I love you! I love you!

76
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,860
I love you!

77
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,960
Rocky Balboa

78
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,960
Get 'em outta here!

79
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,950
Let him breathe...will you? ! Get 'em out of here! Give him air.

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,970
Sit down, Rocky. Sit down, kid.

81
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,970
Rocky, did you think you had it won?

82
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,970
I don't know.

83
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,960
How about a statement, Rocky?

84
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,960
I'm at a loss for words.

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,960
Get back there!

86
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,960
Rocky, did you think you had it won?

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,970
I don't know.

88
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,970
Where's the doctor?

89
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,970
How's my nose look? As bad as Mickey's?

90
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,970
It ain't that horrible. Give him a break!

91
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,970
Rocky,

92
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,980
is that the worst beating you ever took?

93
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,980
You gonna get worse if you don't get outta here!

94
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,970
Rocky, what did you think going into the last round?

95
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,980
I don't know, that I should've stayed in school or something.

96
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,990
Do you think you have brain damage?

97
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,990
I don't see any.

98
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,990
Where is he? Where is he?

99
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,990
Apollo, how about a statement?

100
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,990
Get away from me!

101
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,980
I want the Stallion. You got the Gold Star, Stallion.

102
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,980
You're lucky, so lucky! What you did was a miracle.

103
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,990
You are the luckiest man on the earth!

104
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,990
Do I look lucky?

105
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,000
Look, nobody goes the distance with me!

106
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,000
Get up out of that chair, chump, and let's finish this fight right now.

107
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't, please. Sit down.

108
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,000
Is he serious?

109
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,000
When you were going down, did the bell save you, Apollo?

110
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,000
Bell nothing, man! I can beat that chump!

111
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,010
I'll fight him anyplace, anytime!

112
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,010
Does that mean there'll be a rematch?

113
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,010
I said anyplace, anytime, man!

114
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,010
Apollo, you said no rematch.

115
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,010
Look, chump,

116
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,020
anyplace, anytime!

117
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,010
Rocky, a rematch could be worth millions!

118
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,010
I'm officially retired now.

119
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,010
Don't you run out on me!

120
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,010
I gave you a shot the first time.

121
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,020
Now I'm ready to give you a second shot!

122
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,020
He sure has a lot of energy. You know, you got nothing to prove.

123
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,020
I don't care what the hell them judges said.

124
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,020
This is the man that won the fight!

125
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,020
I'm gonna show you how lucky you are!

126
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,020
You're gonna fight me again, chump. Come back here!

127
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,030
Adrian, you better go home

128
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,030
because I'm gonna be busy healing here for a while.

129
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,040
I wanna be here!

130
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,020
No, maybe you better go home with Paulie and get some sleep.

131
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,040
I love you.I love you.

132
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,040
See you later.

133
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,030
See you, Mick.

134
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,040
Can you fix my nose?

135
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,050
I'm a little depressed about my nose.

136
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,050
We'll fix that, all right.

137
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,050
It's the eye that concerns me.

138
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,060
The eye is great, you know.

139
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:17,050
I ain't never really feIt this good.

140
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,040
You guys should've seen us tonight.

141
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,060
We were good.

142
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,050
I always wanted to be. You should've seen it.

143
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,560
You had him in the 10th and in the 15th, he was gone.

144
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,070
You think so?

145
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,070
Trust me, I was there.

146
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,070
How's your face, Rocky?

147
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,070
I don't know. How's it look?

148
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,070
I wouldn't want it.

149
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,080
Rocky, I got a little favor I'd like to ask you.

150
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,070
You know your friend Gazzo? He admires you a lot.

151
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,090
Tell him to give me your old job with him.

152
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,080
You mean collecting?

153
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,080
Yeah, I'm good with numbers.

154
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,080
Okay, as soon as I get finished, you know, healing here

155
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,090
I'll tell him to give you my old job with him,

156
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,090
okay? I'd appreciate that.

157
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,090
What're you doing here?

158
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,090
Visiting hours are over. I have to ask you to leave.

159
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,100
Okay, I'll see you later, Paulie.

160
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,110
Okay. Everybody's proud of you, Rocky.

161
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,110
Yeah? yeah!

162
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,110
l feel good tonight.

163
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,090
Yeah, ya look good. Let's go.

164
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,110
How are we feeling tonight?

165
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:38,100
Very handsome.

166
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,120
That tastes good.

167
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,110
My kid would die for your autograph.

168
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,120
Sure.

169
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,120
Would you sign it, please?

170
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,120
To my good friend, Charlie Flynn.

171
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,120
My hands are so sore.

172
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,120
It's my first autograph. Thank you.

173
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,140
To my good friend, Charlie Flynn,

174
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:18,130

175
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,150
You, Apollo?

176
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,150
Who is it?

177
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,150
It's just me, Rocky.

178
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,160
Listen, could you answer me one question?

179
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,160
Yeah, sure.

180
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,140

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,150

182
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,150
Thank you.

183
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,170
This coming year, Rocky You all right?

184
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,170
It feels great being outside.

185
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,170
This coming year you gonna make $300,000 with us.

186
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,180
Rocky! Rocky!

187
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,180
Could you sign my head?

188
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,180
Yeah, sure!

189
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,180
I hope it don't go to your brain.

190
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,180
I bet that's heavy.

191
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,180
A little bit.

192
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,180
Think how fast you'll be when you get it off.

193
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,180
Let me use your head for a minute, kid.

194
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,190
Just sign, Rocky, just seal the deal.

195
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,190
I want to talk to you about this here.

196
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,190
It's a standard deal.

197
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,190
Just for talking about shaving stuff.

198
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,180
Sledgehammers, whatever, batteries.

199
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,200
All kinds of commercials.

200
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,200
Like balIs and baseballs?

201
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,200
You're gonna make $300,000. You gotta strike now while the iron's hot.

202
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,200
People kinda forget, you know.

203
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,200
The time is now. Here, sign it here.

204
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,210
It takes you two seconds to sign.

205
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,210
It's a standard deal.

206
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,200
I'll sign it,

207
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,200
but I gotta go now.

208
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,200
Where you going? What could be more important?

209
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,210
I just gotta do some things, you know. I'll be back.

210
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,210
I'll talk to you or something. Where will we call you?

211
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,200
I'll call you. You got a number?

212
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,210
No, I'll just call you.

213
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,220
All right. You call. Here.

214
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,210
The guy's got brain damage.

215
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,220
It's great being out of the hospital, not having to take all those pilIs and everything.

216
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,220
My legs were getting so sore and all that.

217
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,210
From just laying there, I was kinda shrinking and all that.

218
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,220
It's great to be outside, you know.

219
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,230
What are we doing here at the zoo?

220
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,230
You know, I kinda like this zoo a lot.

221
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,230
It's a special place,

222
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,240
especially when it snows.

223
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,240
It kinda smelIs clean and everything like that, you know.

224
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,240
Don't you like the zoo?

225
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,240
I like the zoo.

226
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,230
Yeah, me too.

227
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,250
You know, I was wondering like

228
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,240
what do you think you're doing for like the next 40 or 50 years?

229
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,240
What do you mean?

230
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,250
I was wondering

231
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,250
if you wouldn't mind marrying me very much.

232
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,250
What'd you say?

233
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,250
If you wouldn't mind marrying me too much?

234
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,460
Yes. I'd like to marry you.

235
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,270
Yeah? Yes.

236
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,280
I'll be a good guy, I promise.

237
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,280
I ain't gonna do nothing wrong.

238
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,280
I ain't gonna leave no hair in the sink

239
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,280
or nothing like that, you know.

240
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,290
Things are gonna be great, you know?

241
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,290
We're getting married you know!

242
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,290
You wanna come?

243
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,290
Can you get out for the weekend?

244
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,290
I'll send you an invitation, Mr. Tiger!

245
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,790
That's fantastic, ain't it?

246
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,300
Absolutely. Yes.

247
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,310
I do.Thanks.

248
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,320
You may kiss the bride now.

249
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,320
I gotta take this off.

250
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,330
Go in peace and God bless you.

251
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,330
Thanks, Father,

252
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,330
you done real good. I'm proud of you.

253
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,330
Adrian and Rocky, congratulations!

254
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,340
Rocky, you want to buy into the pet shop?

255
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,340
I'm gonna do commercials.

256
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,340
Commercials? What for, a concussion?

257
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,350
Isn't that Father something?

258
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,350
Good luck to both of you

259
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,350
I gotta go back to the gym.

260
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,350
I got a couple of good prospects.

261
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,350
Are they really good? They're pretty good.

262
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,340
I'll see you around. Thanks for coming.

263
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,360
Excuse me, can I borrow the bridegroom for a minute?

264
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,360
You look beautiful, Adrian.

265
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,360
Yeah, she really turned out pretty.

266
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,350
How much money did you make from your last fight? How much did you clear?

267
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,370
About 37 grand.

268
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,370
l know taxes kill you. What you wanna do with your money now?

269
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,370
You want to put 'em on the street.

270
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,370
Tony, I just got married in here.

271
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,370
I know, and I'm happy for you.

272
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,380
How's about investing in condominiums? It's safe.

273
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,370
Condominiums?

274
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,360
Yeah, condominiums.

275
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,770
I never use them.

276
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,400
Hey, you, what are you doing?

277
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,400
Rocky, what's happening, man?

278
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,400
You know, I just got a little married.

279
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,400
congratulations!

280
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,410
What are you guys doing? Getting some wine in?

281
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,410
Why don't you keep singing some more?

282
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,410
Sing somethin' for him.

283
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,420
Who are they?

284
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,420
They're like a neighborhood jukebox.

285
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,420
I never knew you were so light.

286
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,420
No, if I did,

287
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,420
I would've carried you everywhere.

288
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,420
Are you getting tired?

289
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,430
No, this is great for the arms.

290
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,430
I can't believe we're married.

291
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,430
I got proof in my pocket.

292
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,430
Everything happened so fast.

293
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,440
But I knew it was gonna happen from the start.

294
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,440
What did you know?

295
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,440
The first time I seen you,

296
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,440
I says to myself, I says:

297
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,450
Even though this girl is suffering from the disease of being shy

298
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,450
underneath them sweaters, and hat, and

299
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,440
What'd you have on, about 20 sweaters?

300
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,240
No, three.

301
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,440
Three Sweaters is the best girl in Philly, you know?

302
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,440
I said that. Really?

303
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,450
we're gonna check this out.

304
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,450
Butkus, could you get down? Go on.

305
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,450
Go find another seat, will you?

306
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,460
You want me to help you with this?

307
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,460
Can I take this off?

308
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,460
That's the way I like you.

309
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,480
You know, you're the best thing that ever come into my crazy life.

310
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,470
You know that, huh? Really.

311
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,480
You're the best thing that ever come into my life.

312
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,480
You think it'll always be like this?

313
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,500
Yeah.

314
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,490
I hope you. What?

315
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,500
you never get tired of me.

316
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,510
Oh, no.

317
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,500
You ain't never getting rid of me.

318
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,510
I hope nothing changes.

319
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,520
I ain't changing. I sure ain't

320
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:07,510
never changing nothing about you.

321
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,510
I love you.

322
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,510
I love you, too.

323
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,560
It's a nice car, Rocky.

324
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,560
It's a great car.

325
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,570
Here's the papers for it. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

326
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,570
Congratulations. Lots of luck. Same to you.

327
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,560
Isn't that nice?

328
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,560
We really don't need a car.

329
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,560
I'm gonna be doing commercials.

330
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,570
I can afford this, you know. No problem.

331
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,570
Do you know how to drive?

332
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,570
Do I know how to drive? Do you know how to drive?

333
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,560
I'm one of the greats! Come on, I'll drive you.

334
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,580
This'll just be like Cinderella and the pumpkin, you know.

335
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,580
Do you know how to drive? Do I know how to drive? !

336
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,270
I drive airplanes and bulldozers.

337
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,990
I'd drive you crazy if you'd give me a chance.

338
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,480
You know what I mean?

339
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,590
Look at this here.

340
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,590
Tell me that wouldn't look great on you?

341
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,600
This one's okay.

342
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,590
Look at this black thing here with a tiger on the back.

343
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,590
Black, I like black. It's kinda my favorite color. You wanna buy 'em?

344
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,610
We get 'em before someone else buys 'em. What do you say?

345
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,610
Come on, Adrian.

346
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,610
I think that would be perfect for her.

347
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,610
I think that's perfect, too.

348
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,620
Don't you think this is kind of expensive?

349
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,620
Come on, do you like having a good time?

350
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,610
Then you need a good watch.

351
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,610
I wanna get one for Paulie, too. Okay?

352
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,620
What about one for yourself? For me?

353
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,620
I can't tell time very good.

354
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,620
But, all right, I'll take one, too.

355
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,620
Gloria, you got something nice for Butkus?

356
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,620
Sure thing, Rockyhead.

357
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,630
You like that?

358
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,630
Butkus, look at that.

359
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,630
Your neck looks great, huh?

360
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,630
Gloria, you got something a little smaller?

361
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,630
Look at that.

362
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,640
Oh yeah, look at that.

363
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,640
You see? Now that's what I call class, huh?

364
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,620
Real sharp.

365
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,640
You okay, Butkus?

366
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,650
Nice house.

367
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,650
Look at these bricks, Adrian.

368
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,660
My husband's an expert on bricks.

369
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,660
Are these new bricks?

370
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,660
This is a very solid neighborhood.

371
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,660
I like the bricks. They're very nicely done here. They look very solid.

372
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,650
Nice box. I like this mailbox. These numbers almost add up to nine.

373
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,650
I like that. It's a good omen.

374
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,670
Nice house.

375
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,670
Adrian, baby,

376
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,670
that's a great spot for a bag.

377
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,660
I could teach you how to work that bag someday, you know.

378
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,680
Does it have copper plumbing?

379
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,680
Upstairs and down.

380
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,680
The whole house is supported with steel. The whole thing.

381
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,680
All these floors are solid oak, solid.

382
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,680
Mrs. Balboa,

383
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,680
can I show you the kitchen? You're gonna really like it.

384
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,680
Solid.

385
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,670
Adrian, that's a great spot for a radio. Right over there, you know.

386
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,680
Look at these steps. Nice steps.

387
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,680
A nice kitchen.

388
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,700
What're the taxes every year?

389
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,700
Fifteen hundred. Fifteen hundred.

390
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,690
I like it. I know a pretty good deal when I see one, too.

391
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,700
Excuse me, I want to talk to my husband for one second.

392
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,710
Can I talk to you?

393
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,700
I'm available. I got no appointments.

394
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,710
Rocky, you're making this man's job very easy.

395
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,710
The bank says it will give us

396
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,710
a $16,000 mortgage

397
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,710
at nine and a haIf percent.

398
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,710
That don't matter. Let's get the house?

399
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,710
But we didn't go upstairs.

400
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,710
That's just details. I'm sure it's nice.

401
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,720
Details, huh? Are you sure?

402
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,720
Absolutely, okay?

403
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,720
We'll take the house,

404
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,720
and it better not leak, or else.

405
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,730
Could you stand over there? I gotta talk secretly with my wife.

406
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,720
Sure. Sure.

407
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,720
You know, I kinda feel stupid, talking like this with the lights on.

408
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,740
But the house here,

409
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,730
the solid oak floors and all that stuff and the plumbing

410
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,730
wouldn't mean nothing without you being here

411
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,740
I don't know, without you being here, I'd probably

412
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,740
I wouldn't be here either, you know.

413
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:30,730
You don't have to speak.No?

414
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,740
Okay, let's go celebrate.

415
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,750
I'll beat you to the pool!

416
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:44,760
Hey, you guys! Slow down.

417
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,760
Mary Anne, hon, listen to this.

418
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,750
You didn't beat nobody and anybody

419
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,750
who knows boxing knows the fight was fixed.

420
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,760
This one came from London.

421
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,760
You call yourseIf 'The Champ.' You're a fake

422
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,760
The fight was a fake. Go kill yourself.

423
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,770
Wouldn't you rather play with the children than read hate mail?

424
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,770
How much did you get to carry that bum for 15 rounds?

425
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,770
You're a disgrace to your people.

426
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,770
Why can't you ignore it? !

427
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:14,770
Are you serious?

428
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,780
Let me get you in focus.

429
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,770
You ready, man? All right, I'm ready.

430
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,780
Are you blind, Rocky?

431
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,780
What're you getting wise with me? Throw the ball,

432
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,780
let me see your best, here. I'm waiting for you.

433
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,790
I'm waiting for you.

434
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,790
You can't even play stickball!

435
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,780
Come on, I'm ready now. I'm just warming up.Are you ready for this?

436
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,800
You better keep your mouth closed. It's coming in that direction.

437
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,800
What a shot! Over the roof!

438
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,790
Now I know this day weren't no waste.

439
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,810
Yeah? yes

440
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,800
Adrian, you did it!

441
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,820
You woke up this morning with a smile on your face.

442
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,810
I said, Something special's gonna happen today.

443
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,830
If this kid has your good looks, your good brains and my good left hook...

444
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,820
he's really gonna be something.

445
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:33,820
What if it's a boy, I mean, a girl? What if it's a girl?

446
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,830
I didn't think about that.

447
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,830
She'll be everything I'm not.

448
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,830
She won't have to be shy.

449
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,830
We could give her singing and dancing lessons.

450
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,840
How about a new dress every day? Would you like that?

451
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,840
I'll hire a bodyguard

452
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,840
when she starts going to school

453
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,840
to keep the boys away.

454
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,850
You know how them little boys can be a real pest in general, can't they?

455
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,850
And if it's a boy,

456
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,840
I'd like him to be just like the father.

457
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,840
Don't you think one dumbbell in the family's enough, huh?

458
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,860
I'll tell you one thing. This kid ain't gonna get no tattoos.

459
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,850
He ain't gonna be hanging on no corners or dress like no wise guy like me...

460
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,840
He's gonna be a good somebody like you.

461
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,860
Like you.

462
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,860
No, like you.

463
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,860
Like you.No, like you.

464
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,860
Like you.

465
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,860
Adrian,

466
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,870
we did it, didn't we?

467
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,870
How you feel, Rocky?

468
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,870
Pretty good.

469
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,870
The reason we didn't call you a couple of months ago is

470
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,870
we wanted to wait till the swelling went down.

471
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,870
I see.

472
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,880
But you look terrific now.

473
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,880
We're gonna make a buck together. Don't worry about it.

474
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,870
I got a deal from Smart Deal Toy Company.

475
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,880
Did you ever hear of 'em?

476
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,880
Maybe Mrs. Rocky did. Did you ever hear of a Smart Deal toy?

477
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,880
Big. They're Number One.

478
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,880
And they wanna make a Rocky doll.

479
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,880
You can kick it. You can beat it.

480
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,890
It does everything. For kids.

481
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,890
It takes a terrific beating.

482
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,890
We're gonna make a lot of money with it, okay?

483
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,900
Is he ready, dear?

484
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,900
Finito.

485
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,900
How do I look? The best.

486
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,900
Fabulous.

487
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,910
Adrian, how do I look? Different.

488
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,890
Sensational. Come on, let's get it on.

489
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,900
He's gonna be great.

490
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,910
Don't be nervous.

491
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,910
I look stupid, don't I?

492
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,910
Yes.

493
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,910
You got any deodorant? No.

494
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,920
Excuse me

495
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,920
All right. We're ready. Let's go, Arthur.

496
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,920
In the cage, Rocky.

497
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,920
Just the way we rehearsed.

498
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,920
Everyone, get ready for picture now.

499
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,930
Come on, Rocky, we're running late. Girls, come on. Look alive, dear.

500
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,930
Could I have it a little higher?

501
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,920
That's it.

502
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,920
Magic time.

503
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,930
Roll, please. Speed.

504
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,930
Beast After-Shave, Take One.

505
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,930
Action.

506
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,930
Go now?

507
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,930
Action!

508
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,930
In the morning, I splash it on

509
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,940
and it makes me smeal mainly.

510
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,940
Smeal mainly? Cut!

511
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,940
Isn't that ''smell manly''?

512
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,940
Can you read that, Rocky?

513
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,950
So, let's go again.

514
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,950
Well, excuse me.

515
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,950
You know, I know I said it wrong,

516
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,950
but it really don't smell manly.

517
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,940
I mean, do you think this stuff smelIs like a man?

518
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,950
I say absolutely no.

519
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,950
Are you finished? I am Sorry

520
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,950
Okay, rolling again. Nice and quiet.

521
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,950
''Beast After-Shave,'' Take Two.

522
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,950
Action

523
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,960
In the morning,

524
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,960
I splash it on

525
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,960
and it surrounds my face with class.

526
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,960
Cut!

527
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,960
Action

528
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,970
Beast After-Shave

529
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,970
will turn the women into beasts.

530
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,970
Cut!

531
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:49,970
Action

532
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,980
If you want to be the king of the beasts

533
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,980
and smell like a jungle rat

534
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,970
That's right. It's ''cat.'' They look alike.

535
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,960
Action!

536
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,980
In the afternoon, when I put it on

537
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,970
to go out with the guys and have a rendez-vous

538
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,970
Cut! We're going to the alternate set.We're cutting the set.

539
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,990
I can get it.

540
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,990
I'm sure you can. Will you get out of the cage?

541
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,990
The word, ''rendez-vous''

542
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,990
Rocky, if you don't mind.

543
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,000
Yes, rendez-vous over to the other set,

544
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,000
We've only wasted four hours.

545
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,000
Arthur, will you organize here? We're going to the alternate set.

546
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:32,980
It sounded great before it came out like that.

547
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,000
Get the damn club away from him and get the girIs into their other outfits.

548
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,000
Where are the wardrobe people? Where are the prop people?

549
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:42,990
All right, wet him down!

550
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,010
Arthur, step out, please.

551
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,010
Speed.

552
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,000
''Beast After-Shave, the contender,'' Take Seven.

553
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,010
Try to get it right. Action!

554
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:56,010
Hi, my name is Rocky Balboa, the ltalian Stallion.

555
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,020
They say I'm the American Dream

556
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:01,020
but not because

557
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,030
Can I do it over again?

558
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,020
Christ! Cut!

559
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,020
No, just keep it rolling.

560
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,020
Just, read it off the dummy cards.

561
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,010
Dummy cards? Please, go on.

562
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,030
Wait a minute. I'd like to explain something.

563
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:21,030
You know, I ain't punchy. I got what you call a relaxed brain

564
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,040
but I ain't punchy, you know. It's just the way I talk here.

565
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,040
What's the difference?

566
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,040
Can you just do it the way it's written?

567
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,040
This whole thing here ain't right.

568
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,040
What isn't right?

569
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,050
You're a rude guy.

570
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,050
I'm trying very hard and you're being rude.

571
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,050
That's bad manners, ain't it, Adrian?

572
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,040
Yes.

573
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,040
But I'll tell ya, I gotta be almost punchy to be

574
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,040
doing this in front of my wife.

575
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,040
You wanna quit? Then quit! Leave!

576
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,050
Get outta here! I didn't want you for this setup in the first place!

577
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,050
You have wasted, wasted our time, sir.

578
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,060
This is a complete bust.

579
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,060
Leonard, where are you going?

580
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:00,050
l want you to take him with you, Leonard. Take this man with you.

581
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,070
He is not a professional. I only work with professionals.

582
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,070
You cost us thousands of dollars

583
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,070
because you can't read!

584
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,070
snarled the robber.

585
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,070
It's no time to cuss me,

586
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,070
By God! Fellas, grab your rifles an' take color cover.

587
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,070
How's it sound?

588
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,070
It's good.

589
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,070
You know, being a good reader's gonna help me get

590
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,070
a good office job, you know.

591
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,080
Wanna hear some more?

592
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:27,070
I can't wait. OK.

593
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:30,080
There ain't no cover, Smokey

594
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,080
We better head for the canyon.

595
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,090
You read nice.

596
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,090
Thank you. You lie nice.

597
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,090
And how far did you go in high school?

598
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:43,080
Ninth.

599
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,100
Now, one last question.

600
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,090
Do you have a criminal record?

601
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:53,080
Nothing worth bragging about.

602
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:57,090
Would you be interested in some sort of manual labor?

603
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,090
I got nothing against honest manual labor.

604
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:06,100
It's just that I'dlike to see if I could make a living sitting down like you're doing over there.

605
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,110
Can I be honest?

606
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,110
No one's going to offer you an office job.

607
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,110
There's too much competition.

608
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,120
Why don't you fight?

609
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,110
I read you're a very good fighter.

610
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,120
Yeah? Well...

611
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,120
Was you ever punched in the face 500 times a night?

612
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:29,110
Stings after a while, you know.

613
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,120
Thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it.

614
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,140
Mr. Balboa, Yeah.

615
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,140
I'm very sorry. We have nothing.

616
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,130
Are you sure? Next

617
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,150
Look, pal, you gotta be realistic. You got no high-school diploma no qualifications.

618
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,140
Wouldn't you be more content

619
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:01,130
with a good-paying menial labor job?

620
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,150
The way I see it is I can get another job if I wanna.

621
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,160
But do I wanna? Do I wanna be doing something I ain't gonna be happy doing?

622
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,160
Plus, you know, we need the money now, Butkus.

623
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:21,150
Dogs don't wanna hear my problems. Come on.

624
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,160
I wish I was a canine sometimes.

625
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,170
Give me a kiss.

626
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,170
The only job I got's lugging beef.

627
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,160
You have nothin' better for Rocky than hauling beef?

628
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,170
That's all I got,and we're cutting back,too.if you want to work,

629
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,170
it'll be from week to week, okay?

630
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,170
That's okay with me, but when can I start?

631
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,170
How about tomorrow?

632
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,180
How about today?

633
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,180
Okay, we got a load coming in. Great.

634
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,180
Paulie, you look kinda skinny there!

635
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,180
He's losing weight, ain't he?

636
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,180
Don't bother to thank me.

637
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,180
Thanks a lot, Paulie.

638
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,190
And, you don't have to thank me for the watch either.

639
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,240
There's the best-looking thing I've seen all day.

640
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,250
You look tired.

641
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,250
No, my face is tired.

642
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,250
I feel okay.

643
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,250
Do you want to take a hot bath?

644
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:34,260
No, come on. I feel dynamic, honest.

645
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,260
Listen, tomorrow...

646
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,260
I was thinking at work maybe after work

647
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,260
I'll take you out.

648
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,270
You wanna do something nice, huh? You want to do that?

649
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,260
How's your stomach? Fine.

650
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:50,250
You look great. You know that?

651
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,260
You look tired, though.

652
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,310
they're just like old friends, ain't they?

653
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,310
Old friends never tasted this good.

654
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,290
I heard that!

655
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,310
You

656
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,320
You Rocky

657
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,320
You wanted me, Frank?

658
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:11,310
Roky, I gotta let you go.

659
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,330
How come? I'm working hard.

660
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,330
I'm doing good.

661
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,330
Real good,

662
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,330
but we gotta cut back on manpower.

663
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,330
You ain't got enough time in.

664
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,330
It's seniority.

665
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:26,320
How about if I take a cut in pay, all right?

666
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:29,330
Can't do it. Union rules.

667
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:34,330
Rules, rules.

668
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,340
Can I finish out the day?

669
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:42,330
Sure. Rocky, I'm sorry.

670
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,340
Me, too.

671
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,360
You got more stories than a book, you know that?

672
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,350
There's my brother-in-law, Rocky. Give me the five!

673
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,350
My brother-in-law came to visit me.

674
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,350
How are you? How you doing?

675
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,360
Looking over your old stomping ground?

676
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,360
Paulie, you wanna buy this car?

677
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,370
I thought you liked it.

678
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,370
It's okay, I don't need it no more.

679
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,370
I have a hard time making these right turns with my bad eye.

680
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,360
I keep hitting trash cans and things like that.

681
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,380
You got problems at home? Need bread?

682
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,380
Everything's okay.

683
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,380
You know, this car'd look great wrapped around you, you know.

684
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:31,370
Look, if you need a handout, I'll give you a handout.

685
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,390
I don't need no handout, Paulie.

686
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,380
Look, you wanna buy the car?

687
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,380
Sure.

688
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:42,370
Rocky, why don't you be smart and fight again?

689
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,390
That's okay, I don't need to fight no more.

690
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,390
Listen, you wanna buy the car?

691
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,390
You wanna pick up the payments?

692
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,390
My sister giving you a hard time?

693
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:53,380
You know, if she is, you break her teeth.

694
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:58,390
I appreciate the advice,Paulie,but I kinda like her teeth where they are.

695
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,390
Here ya go, you bought yourseIf a car.

696
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,410
It's a good car, you know.

697
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,400
You gotta buckle up for safety and all that.

698
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,390
Where you going? You need a lift?

699
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,400
See you around.

700
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:27,410
Say hi to my sister for me.

701
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:32,410
Listen, if you two need the car, just ask!

702
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,430
When did you get home? I thought you were at work.

703
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,430
No,

704
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,430
I ain't at work no more. I got...

705
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:56,430
I got canned today.

706
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:59,440
What happened? I don't know.

707
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,440
It was nobody's fault.They were just cutting back.You know,it was economics.

708
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,450
What're you gonna do? I don't know.

709
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,440
I was thinking about fighting.

710
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,460
What about your eye?

711
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,460
The doctor said you shouldn't fight anymore.

712
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,450
He recommended I don't fight,

713
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,450
and I recommend that I do.

714
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,460
You can go blind.

715
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,460
Nobody's going blind.

716
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,460
Honest, I see great.

717
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:30,450
And I see like a beagle or something like that.

718
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,460
You could be whatever you wanna be. You don't have to fight anymore.

719
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,470
You know, I am a fighter. Not too good,

720
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,470
but that's what I do.

721
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,480
Rocky, you gave me your word you wouldn't fight anymore.

722
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:48,470
I mean, if we need, I could get a job.

723
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,460
You don't have to do that.

724
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,480
Oh, sure. I can get my job back,

725
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:01,470
you know, part time, at the pet shop.

726
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,490
But I'm the one who's supposed to support.

727
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:14,490
It's just for a little while.

728
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,500
Listen, what if you catch some

729
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,500
pet-shop disease or something?

730
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,500
There're no pet-shop diseases, Rocky.

731
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,490
Really, I wanna work.

732
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:28,490
You really wanna do it?

733
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,500
We need the money.

734
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:35,500
It'll come in handy.

735
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,510
Maybe you're right, you know.

736
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:43,500
You know what's best.

737
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,520
Darling,could you start dinner? I'm starting to get a little hungry.

738
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,520
I just wanna finish my workout here, okay?

739
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,520
Sure.

740
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,520
Who the hell is there? !

741
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:14,530
Avon lady.

742
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:16,570
Who's that? Rocky?

743
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,580
I don't remember giving you no key.

744
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:23,570
You don't look so bad, do you, kid?

745
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,590
What's that?

746
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,590
An outer-space monster you brought me?

747
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,590
No, that's Butkus, my large dog. What's that in your ear there?

748
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:33,580
What is that? I hear stupid things better.

749
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,600
Well now, did you come here to show me that dog?

750
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,600
Mickey,

751
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,600
can I have my locker back?

752
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,590
Really? What's on your mind?

753
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,600
Fighting.

754
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:46,600
Fighting? What? Do you wanna go blind?

755
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:50,590
Nobody's going blind. Now you heard what I said? And the eye's great.

756
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,600
No problem.

757
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,610
Listen, every pug thinks he has

758
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,610
one good one left.

759
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,600
Now forget it because your fighting career is over, kid.

760
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,610
Is that right? I think that's right.

761
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,610
You know, I spend my whole life getting a career.

762
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,620
I get one and you tell me it's over.

763
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,620
What's the matter?

764
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,620
You shook the hell out of the champion of the whole wide world.

765
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,620
Be happy with that.

766
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,630
Maybe we can do better this time.

767
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,620
Or worse. What about that?

768
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,620
You, Mick. I've done you a favor last time, you know.

769
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:22,610
Can you do me one this time?

770
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,630
I don't know.

771
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,620
You don't understand me. I wanna show you something now. Test you.

772
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,630
Now, you look, right there, at the end of my nose.

773
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,640
I wanna test you. Look at your nose.

774
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,640
Now, when I bring my finger in here,

775
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,640
tell me when you see it, will yo?

776
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,640
There's the little thing. I see it.

777
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,640
That's good.

778
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,640
I told you it was okay.

779
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,650
Wait. Now we try the other lamp.

780
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,630
Now, look here, will you? Now tell me.

781
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,640
I see it.

782
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,650
No, you see nothing!

783
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,650
Creed would've caved in the whole side of your face.

784
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,650
Now, forget it, kid.

785
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,650
You got the heart,

786
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,650
but you ain't got the tooIs no more.

787
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,660
Now, forget it!

788
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,660
Is that right?

789
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,660
That is right. Yeah?

790
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:13,650
Maybe it's you who ain't got it no more, you know that?

791
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,670
Now look, you didn't even see that coming,

792
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,670
did you? No.

793
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:25,670
That was from a broken-down pug like me.

794
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:30,660
What do you think the champ would do to you?

795
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:36,680
I don't know, hurt me bad.

796
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:39,680
No, he'd hurt you permanent.

797
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,680
Permanent!

798
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,690
if I can't fight no more

799
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:54,690
then maybe I can help out around here, you know.

800
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,700
Here? Sure, but

801
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,690
You know, you're like royalty here, kid.

802
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,690
Do you want those guys to see

803
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:07,690
you carrying toweIs and buckets around? Where's your dignity?

804
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:13,690
I don't know how to say this, you know.

805
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:18,700
It's just I gotta be around it.

806
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,720
All right, kid.

807
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:29,710
Will you come back tomorrow, huh?

808
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,710
Thanks a lot, Mick.

809
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:57,740
Look,

810
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:01,740
I don't know about anybody else,but since I'm gonna be promoting the fight myself,

811
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,730
I want a lot more pressure put on for a rematch.

812
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,750
We can get the same money for the two top contenders.

813
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,740
Why go after Balboa? Why?

814
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,740
Because there's still a lot of people out there that think he won.

815
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,740
There's a lot of people accusing me of having the fight fixed

816
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,750
accusing me of being a fake,and insulting my kids at school.

817
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,750
That's why!

818
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,750
You wanna hear the truth?

819
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:22,750
I wanna hear the truth.

820
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,760
The truth is he was damn lucky.

821
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,760
Now he's all finished.

822
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,760
I mean, he's been hanging around doing nothing for six months.

823
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,750
And any trainer worth anything wouldn't have nothing to do with him.

824
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,770
Now I say,

825
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,770
Let's go after some new meat.

826
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,770
Forget this bum.

827
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:44,760
Do you think I beat him the last time? Do you?

828
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,770
You got the decision.

829
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,760
Man, I won, but I didn't beat him!

830
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:53,760
What are you afraid of, Tony?

831
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:54,780
Honest?

832
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:59,770
Yeah, honest.

833
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,790
He's all wrong for us, baby.

834
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,790
I saw you beat that man

835
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:13,770
like I never saw no man get beat before.

836
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:17,780
And the man kept coming after you.

837
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:22,780
We don't need that kind of man in our life.

838
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,800
I know what you're feeling.

839
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:30,790
Let it go!

840
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:35,800
Let it go! You're the champ.

841
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,810
Thank you.

842
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,810
You're in charge of my public relations, right?

843
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,820
I want a new campaign started.

844
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:47,820
I want something done publicly to bring this man out.

845
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:52,800
I want something done to jar this man's pride.I want something done to get the people around him talking.

846
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:56,820
You realize if we use this humiliation tactic

847
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,820
you're setting yourseIf up as the bad guy.

848
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,810
Look, man, whatever gets him in the ring.

849
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:29,840
What's happening?

850
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,840
What're you talking about?

851
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,840
You heard me. What is this?

852
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:49,850
It's kinda funny, don't you think?

853
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:19,880
Chico, listen. What's with the grin?

854
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:22,870
How'd you get so happy with yourself? Let me tell ya something.

855
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,890
Snarl more, you see.

856
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,880
Now a good snarl can give you what the Bible calIs a psychological edge.

857
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,880
Because ya snarl on your punches.

858
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,880
Wait a minute. Rocky! Come here a minute, will you?

859
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,890
Show this Latin lamebrain

860
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,880
how to snarl and punch. Show him that.

861
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:42,890
That's it, you see!

862
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:46,890
That's ugly! That's a snarl.

863
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:49,900
John will ya empty them buckets? They're flowing over. Will you do that?

864
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,900
Johnny, I'll do it.

865
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,900
Let him do it.

866
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,910
I got it, Rocky. Come on, I don't mind.

867
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,900
It's no problem.

868
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,890
Wait a minute.

869
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:07,900
Now you can take it.

870
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,910
Can't you think of anything tougher to say than ''whoops''?

871
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,910
Come on, Chink, hit that right. Bang!

872
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:41,930
Tony, how you doing?

873
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:44,940
How am I doing? No, how are you doing?

874
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:47,940
What're ya doing? Give it to me straight.

875
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:50,940
You know, sweeping. Making a few bucks here and there.

876
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,940
You ain't no janitor, Rocky. You don't need a job like this.

877
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,650
Besides, you're ltalian.

878
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,950
Now you come back and work for me, Rocky.

879
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:01,940
What would I be doing? You mean like...

880
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,960
collecting or something? What else?

881
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:06,960
You come back, work on the docks, get some fresh air.

882
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,960
It stinks in here.

883
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:11,960
Tony, I appreciate the offer, but...

884
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,960
I can't do that stuff no more.

885
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,960
It's healthy, huh? Look, I gotta go.

886
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,960
Take it easy, huh, champ?

887
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,950
See you around.

888
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,970
Remember that guy, Rocky.

889
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,960
How's everybody in the clubhouse tonight?

890
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,990
Fine. How'd your day go?

891
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,990
A million laughs. You know, it was great. You need some help with that?

892
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,990
Yes. Yes, ok.

893
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,990
You know Adrian,

894
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,990
l was thinking maybe you oughta stay home and rest your stomach.

895
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,000
Come on, Rocky, it's just part time. We need the money.

896
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:07,990
Well, maybe you're right.

897
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:11,000
There we go.

898
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,010
That ain't my brand, huh? I like oatmeal.

899
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,010
Listen, why don't we forget all this work?

900
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,990
I'll tell ya a few jokes on the way home and maybe you'll laugh,

901
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:25,000
We need a few laughs in our life. What do ya think? Maybe?

902
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,010
Yes.

903
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,010
Maybe. Okay,

904
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,010
let's get outta here, okay?

905
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,010
Here we go.

906
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,020
Listen, Adrian Listen to this one:

907
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:36,020
Why do cows wear bells?

908
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,020
Why?

909
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,020
Because their horns don't work.

910
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:44,010
Isn't that killing you? No? Huh?

911
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,030
Everybody liked it in third grade.

912
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:51,020
I used to break everybody up with it.

913
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:58,020
You really sweep good, man.

914
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,030
Is he talking to you?

915
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:05,030
He has me mixed up with somebody else. Come on.

916
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:10,030
Italian chicken!

917
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,410
You guys got the easy life.

918
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,400
How you guys doing? Did anybody move today, you know? Huh?

919
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,410
How's life in the bowl?

920
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,410
You gotta exercise once in a while.

921
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:24,420
Would you like a little snack, a little something?

922
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,420
Come on, Cuff. Hello, Link,

923
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,420
what are you drowning down there, huh?

924
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:34,420
You wanna hear some TV, huh?

925
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:46,430
Come here, Butkus. Come here, boy.

926
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:49,440
What'd you do today, huh?

927
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,440
Did you bark at anybody today?

928
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,440
You know, Adrian,

929
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,440
sometimes I look at Butkus. I don't think he's a normal canine.

930
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,450
What you think he is? I don't know.

931
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:04,450
He's just don't look like a regular dog sometimes when I look inside there.

932
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,460
Earlier today, I was down at Apollo Creed's palatial gym

933
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:09,460
as usual,

934
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,460
the world champion was not at a loss for words about Rocky Balboa.

935
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,470
I know a lot of people wanna see me

936
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,470
in a rematch with a timid fellow who calIs himseIf "The ltalian Stallion."

937
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,460
But this man does not have the honor to meet me in the ring.

938
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:23,480
Rocky Balboa did officially retire.

939
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:24,480
What is your name, huh?

940
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,480
The bum's hiding. The bum's running.

941
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:29,480
He doesn't wanna face me. He's scared.

942
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,470
You've been under close scrutiny ever since that split-decision victory.

943
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,490
I think there's more here than meets the eye.

944
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,490
A lot of reporters, including me,

945
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,490
thought it was an even draw.

946
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,490
That's your opinion, you're entitled to it.

947
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,500
But now I'm ready to have a rematch

948
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,500
to prove that this lucky club-fighter, that's what he is

949
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,500
does not have the skill

950
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:49,500
to last five minutes

951
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,500
in the ring with a superior athlete like me.

952
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,510
The man's running. The man's hiding. The man doesn't wanna face me.

953
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:56,510
So I say to you, Rocky Balboa,

954
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,510
or whatever your name is

955
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,510
that I want the American people to know I want the whole world to know

956
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,510
that I'm ready,willing and able to meet you anywhere,anyplace,anytime.

957
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:04,520
I'll meet and defeat this so-called fighter...

958
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:07,520
who calIs himseIf "The ltalian Stallion."

959
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:09,520
If the man only has the guts to give me a call.

960
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,520
And you can call me collect. Call me, Balboa!

961
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,530
This would be a legitimate rematch the boxer against the puncher,

962
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,530
and I think everyone wants to see them

963
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,530
back in the ring together.

964
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,530
But there's only one problem:

965
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:24,540
Where is Rocky Balboa?

966
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:26,530
No-good bum!

967
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:37,540
You know, I was thinking that I ain't supposed to do no commercials

968
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:42,540
and I ain't supposed to work in no meat house.

969
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:46,560
I'm supposed to be a fighter.

970
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:51,550
I thought you gave that up.

971
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,570
I think I'm becoming a nobody again, too.

972
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,570
In whose eye? Not mine.

973
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:01,560
In mine. In here.

974
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:07,570
We'll get by.That's just it.

975
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:10,580
I don't want just to get by the hard way, you know?

976
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,580
I want you to have good things.

977
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,590
I want the kid to have good things.

978
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:17,590
We'll have them.

979
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:21,580
I just think we need them now. Don't you?

980
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:24,600
Rocky, please.

981
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:28,590
You don't have to prove anything.

982
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:31,600
Adrian, it's all I know.

983
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,600
I don't want you to do it.

984
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:40,600
It's all I know.

985
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:44,610
Adrian

986
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:48,610
You know

987
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:49,620
I never asked you

988
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,620
to stop being a woman, you know.

989
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,630
please.

990
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,630
I'm asking you, please.

991
01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:00,620
Don't ask me to stop being a man.

992
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,670
I think we oughta knock his block off.

993
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:38,660
Absolutely.

994
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:44,670
I'm sorry.

995
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:53,670
Let's do it.

996
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,690
Apollo,

997
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,690
has a site been chosen for the rematch?

998
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,690
This fight will be held in the Philadelphia Spectrum.

999
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,690
Because I want this man's home town to see this.

1000
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,700
I want all of Philadelphia. I want all of America,

1001
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,700
I want the whole world

1002
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,700
to see me destroy this man after two short rounds.

1003
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:12,700
Because after this fight,he's gonna have to donate what's gonna be left of his body to science.

1004
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,710
But there won't be much. That, I can guarantee.

1005
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,700
what do you think about the fight taking place in the Spectrum?

1006
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:21,710
I'm very happy about that.Why?

1007
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,720
It's only about 10 minutes from my house.

1008
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,720
A lot of people say you lost the fight, a victim of the Southpaw Jinx.

1009
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,720
Did fighting a left-hander throw you off?

1010
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,720
Southpaw Jinx nothing!

1011
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,730
Last time,I took the fight too lightly and this man was just plain lucky.

1012
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,730
But this time, you all will see

1013
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,730
the real Apollo Creed.

1014
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,740
The world's gonna see the real Apollo. Lightning fast and hard to catch.

1015
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:47,730
No playing, no jiving. Just business.

1016
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:48,740
Rocky,

1017
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:52,730
do you think you have a chance this time against Apollo?

1018
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,750
I don't know. He looks pretty mad.

1019
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,750
Me and Mick, we're gonna try our best.

1020
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,750
His lungs he's gonna punch out.

1021
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,760
Now who's that, Al Capone?

1022
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:05,760
I wouldn't sweat you.

1023
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:09,760
A lot of people may not like me and that's okay.

1024
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,760
But come November,

1025
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,770
Apollo Creed will provide the ultimate gala spectacle on Thanksgiving,

1026
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,770
in front of this man's home crowd

1027
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,770
I'm gonna drop him like a bad habit.

1028
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:21,770
Rocky, your pay for the fight is very substantial.

1029
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:23,780
What're you gonna do with the money? Yes, what're you gonna do?

1030
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:27,770
First thing I gotta do is, I gotta pay the rent, you know.

1031
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:32,770
Then,I made this list on the way over and I was just thinking of things to do.

1032
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:36,780
I'd like to get a couple of hats, a motorcycle and

1033
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,790
a couple of quarts of perfume, for Adrian.

1034
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,790
She likes to smell good.

1035
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:43,780
And some Muppet toys, you know. Ernie and Big Bird

1036
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:48,790
and that frog. What's his name, Kermit?

1037
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,800
I thought maybe a statue for the Church and

1038
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:56,800
I think a snow-cone machine for you, Paulie.You like snow cones,don't you?

1039
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:00,800
Rocky, got anything derogatory to say about the champ?

1040
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:03,820
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.

1041
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,820
How about some clowning shots, Apollo?

1042
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:10,810
Does this look like a circus to you, man? !

1043
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:15,820
Come November, you're mine.

1044
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:20,820
He's very upset.

1045
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:27,830
See how he bumps that jab into your eye?

1046
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,840
Yeah.

1047
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,840
You got guts to go back in the ring with him, kid.

1048
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,840
Thanks a lot, Mick.

1049
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,850
Your style's too easy to figure out.

1050
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:41,850
Left-handed fighters, they're the worst.

1051
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:43,860
They lead with their face mostly,

1052
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:45,860
gotta throw that big left.

1053
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,860
The right's no damn good.

1054
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:50,860
They oughta outlaw southpaws.

1055
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,860
Why didn't you tell me this before?

1056
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:56,860
I didn't wanna hurt your feelings. Now, look

1057
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:00,860
You gotta pull this miracle off. You gotta change everything.

1058
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:02,870
You gotta learn to be a right-handed fighter.

1059
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:05,880
Now, this'll confuse Apollo

1060
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:08,880
and it'll protect that bad eye.

1061
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:10,880
No, I can't learn how to fight right-handed no more.

1062
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,880
What's can't? There ain't no can'ts! There's no can'ts!

1063
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,890
Now he will beat you uglier than you are now.

1064
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,890
Now listen, you start fighting right-handed

1065
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:23,900
and then ya change sudden

1066
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:24,900
and that'll make history.

1067
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:26,900
But first, we gotta get speed,

1068
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:29,900
demon speed.

1069
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:33,890
Speed's what we need.

1070
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:34,910
We need greasy, fast speed!

1071
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:36,910
Now, I show you a trick how to get some speed in them legs.

1072
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,910
You have to wear that stinking sweatshirt?

1073
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:40,910
It brings me luck, you know.

1074
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,910
You know what it brings? It brings flies.

1075
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:44,920
Now listen, I want ya to try Listen to me!

1076
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:47,920
I want you to try to chase this little chicken.

1077
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:50,920
Why do I gotta chase a chicken for? It's embarrassing, you know.

1078
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,920
First, because I said so.

1079
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,930
And second, because chicken-chasing

1080
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,930
is how we always used to train in the old days.

1081
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,930
You catch this thing, you can catch greased lightning.

1082
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:02,930
I'd rather eat it than chase it.

1083
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:04,940
It ain't mature, but all right.

1084
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:06,940
Neither are you very mature!

1085
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:08,940
I'm a fighter. I ain't a farmer.

1086
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,940
Come on at it! Go on and get him!

1087
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,940
Get him, get him!

1088
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,950
What's the matter with you? Get him!

1089
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,950
Come on! What's the matter with you? Get him!

1090
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:21,940
Pick him up! Pick him up!

1091
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:23,960
Pull him around!

1092
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:26,960
What's the matter? You're so fast.

1093
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:28,960
Are your standards still speed, speed! ?

1094
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:30,960
Can't you catch a little chicken?

1095
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,960
Come on, run!

1096
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,970
Move your tail!

1097
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,960
You look like a girl out there.

1098
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:42,970
I feel like a Kentucky-fried idiot.

1099
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:44,980
Wake up, will you? Will you wake up?

1100
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,980
What's the matter with my sister?

1101
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,980
Adrian don't like this.

1102
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,980
She started crying and everything.

1103
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:52,980
She don't like me fighting no more.

1104
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,990
What's with this domestic stuff? !

1105
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:56,990
Jab that till it hurts!

1106
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,990
Five hundred times without stopping.

1107
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:02,990
Do you hear me? ! Five hundred times.

1108
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:05,000
Mick, I wanna use my other arm.

1109
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:07,000
If you do, I'm gonna chop it off. Is that clear?

1110
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:09,000
I'll figure something.

1111
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:11,000
I wish you would. I'd appreciate it, you know.

1112
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,000
I'm sorry, are you finished?

1113
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,010
Can we go to work?

1114
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,010
That would be nice. Now hit that bag.

1115
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,010
Jab it till it hurts. Go ahead!

1116
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:22,010
Three...four....

1117
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:25,020
Now I want 500 high ones! Go!

1118
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:29,010
Where was I, seven or eight?

1119
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:31,020
Five, six.

1120
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,020
One, two. One, two. Come on,

1121
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:35,030
turn it over. Come on, stab it, stab it. Come on!

1122
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:40,020
Hit it! Come on! Speed! Speed! Speed!

1123
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:43,030
All right, pick it up!

1124
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:46,040
Faster! Faster!

1125
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:48,040
Faster!

1126
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:53,030
Come on! Faster!

1127
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,040
Time!

1128
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:06,050
Time!

1129
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,060
Leave me alone!

1130
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,060
Get up!

1131
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,070
Get me another one, all right?

1132
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,070
Come on, you gotta ease up on these sparring partners.

1133
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:22,060
You just get me another man.

1134
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:28,080
What's the matter?

1135
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:31,080
That bag's too fast for you?

1136
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:42,090
They gonna pound that sass right out of him.

1137
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:44,100
Last time, we should've won,

1138
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:47,100
but this time you're gonna be scary, kid.

1139
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:51,090
You're gonna be a greasy, fast, ltalian monster!

1140
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:55,100
You're gonna eat lightnin'. You're gonna crap thunder!

1141
01:08:55,140 --> 01:09:00,100
We're gonna have to put you in a cage, kid.

1142
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:02,110
Let's take a break, Mick, all right?

1143
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:03,110
Break? What break?

1144
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:06,120
Where you going? We're not finished.

1145
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:11,110
I said, where the hell you going? ! Talking to myself, mister.

1146
01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:50,160
Speed! Speed!

1147
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,160
Catch that punk!

1148
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,170
Speed, damn it! Speed!

1149
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,170
Can't you catch that little squirt?

1150
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,170
Can't you? !

1151
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,170
Come on! Get the lead out!

1152
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:03,170
Move! Move! Fast!

1153
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:05,180
You look dead.

1154
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:07,180
If you're gonna catch that little speedball

1155
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:09,180
you're gonna catch Creed easy.

1156
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:12,180
Come on! Move, move!

1157
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:13,180
Time!

1158
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:18,180
Dead-ass, get over here!

1159
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:22,180
You sick, kid?

1160
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:24,200
What's the matter with you?

1161
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:25,200
Nothing.

1162
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:27,200
Let me tell you something, kid.

1163
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:30,200
Now, for a 45-minute fight

1164
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:34,190
you gotta train hard for Forty-five thousand minutes.

1165
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,210
That's 10 weeks.

1166
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,210
That's 10 hours a day, you listening? !

1167
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,210
You ain't even trained one! I don't know

1168
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:46,210
what the hell you're waiting for.

1169
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:49,220
I don't know

1170
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,220
Suit yourself.

1171
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,230
Rocky.

1172
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,230
Paulie, how you doing?

1173
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,230
I'm worried about you. I been watching.

1174
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:01,230
What? Your head ain't screwed on right.

1175
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:04,240
Come on. I'm doing okay. You know,

1176
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:06,240
I've been thinking if you'd like to work my corner.

1177
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:09,240
You wanna get involved in this fight?

1178
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:11,240
Get involved in what? Watching you get murdered?

1179
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,240
Come on, I'm doing okay.

1180
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,250
My sister got you so guilty

1181
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,250
you're running all over the place.

1182
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,250
No, it ain't all right.

1183
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,250
Paulie, it's okay. All right?

1184
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:23,250
It's not okay.

1185
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:28,250
You just leave Adrian alone, all right?

1186
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,270
Hey kid, carry this will ya?

1187
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:42,260
Because I liked ya better when ya was carrying spit!

1188
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:44,280
What's that supposed to mean?

1189
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:46,280
It means that you're training like a ninth-grade pug

1190
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,280
who oughta be pumping gas in Jersey someplace.

1191
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:50,280
Yeah? That's what it means.

1192
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,280
I think I wanna go take a shower, Mick.

1193
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,280
Soak your head someplace. Soak it good.

1194
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:10,290
Adrian, where are you? Paulie.

1195
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:12,300
What the hell are ya doing?

1196
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:13,300
What do you mean?

1197
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:16,310
About what?

1198
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:20,300
About messing up that guy over there.

1199
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:22,310
I'm just trying to keep him safe.

1200
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:25,320
What, feeding these goddamn squirrels?

1201
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,320
Did I teach ya how to do that

1202
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:29,320
while you're ditching the guy when he needs your help?

1203
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:30,320
I can't believe my ears.

1204
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,320
You didn't teach me anything.

1205
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,330
And I never hurt Rocky.

1206
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,330
You're messing up his brain real bad. Do you know that?

1207
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,330
That's not what I'm doing. I don't know what you're talking about.

1208
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,330
Don't tell me!

1209
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,330
He's gonna get hurt because of you.

1210
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:44,340
It ain't true. Don't say that!

1211
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:45,340
I'm saying it.

1212
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:47,340
Come across and tell him it's all right.

1213
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:48,340
It's not all right, Paulie!

1214
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,340
If he goes blind, you walk away.

1215
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:55,340
I can't. I love him, you don't!

1216
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:00,350
What're you doing?

1217
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:02,350
What're you doing? What's wrong?

1218
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:07,350
Adrian, what's the matter?

1219
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:10,360
Come on, where're your guts?

1220
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,360
What's your problem, Mick?

1221
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,360
My problem? You got a problem, kid.

1222
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,370
You got a ticker problem.

1223
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,370
What's the matter? You got nothing left inside, huh?

1224
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:25,370
Because you're training like a damn bum. You know that?

1225
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:26,380
A bum?

1226
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,380
A bum!

1227
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:31,380
Maybe you're right. Maybe I ain't got it no more.

1228
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:36,380
Then don't you waste my time no more, do you hear that?

1229
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,390
Go away!

1230
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,390
Go back to the docks where you belong.

1231
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:43,380
You'll go back to being a two-bit nothing!

1232
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:45,400
But don't you ever come back here again

1233
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:47,400
because I'm too old

1234
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,400
to waste my time

1235
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:51,400
trying to train a no-good loser like you.

1236
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,400
You bum!

1237
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,410
They want you across the street.

1238
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:59,400
You're wife's sick.

1239
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:08,420
Mr. Balboa, I'm Dr. Cooper.

1240
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:11,420
The baby is fine even though it's a month premature.

1241
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,420
What is it?

1242
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:13,420
It's a boy.

1243
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:16,430
Holy smoke, I didn't know she could do it.

1244
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,430
How's Adrian? Where is Adrian?

1245
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:22,420
She's had complications.

1246
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:23,430
Like what?

1247
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:24,440
Your wife was hemorrhaging

1248
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:26,440
when she was brought in.

1249
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:30,430
The premature delivery was most likely caused by straining or overwork.

1250
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:35,440
And the sudden loss of blood has caused her to slip into a coma.

1251
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,660
Adrian, it's me.

1252
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,490
They said you're very sick, but

1253
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,480
I don't wanna believe that.

1254
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:28,490
Maybe you're just tired, you know.

1255
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:34,490
Don't worry about nothing. You just sleep as long as ya want, okay?

1256
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:39,500
Because I'm gonna be here when ya wake up.

1257
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:47,520
Rocky, come on.

1258
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:50,520
You're not doing any good, you know.

1259
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,520
Let's go see the kid. That's what Adrian would want.

1260
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:57,520
No, we gotta see him together.

1261
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:02,520
We gotta see him together.

1262
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,550
Mr. Balboa

1263
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:18,550
visiting hours are over.

1264
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:22,540
Well, can't I stay? I'll be quiet.

1265
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:27,550
I'm sorry. Hospital rules.

1266
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:32,550
I can't do any more of this watchin' stuff.

1267
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,570
Do you have a chapel?

1268
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,560
Yes, we do.

1269
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:54,570
Good night.

1270
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,600
Hi, Rocky.

1271
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,600
It's three in the morning.

1272
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:27,610
You know that I went up to your house.

1273
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:30,620
They told me you was here.

1274
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:35,620
It's 3:00 a.m., kid.

1275
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:40,620
Adrian she's a good girl.

1276
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:46,630
You know, I'm sorry for both of you.

1277
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:51,640
There's nothing I can do, is there?

1278
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,640
Except

1279
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,650
I'd like to tell you something once,

1280
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,650
and then I ain't gonna say it again.

1281
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:04,660
Rock, you got another shot.

1282
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:09,650
It's the second shot

1283
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:14,650
the biggest title in the world.

1284
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:18,660
And you're gonna be swapping punches

1285
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:23,660
with the most dangerous fighter in the world.

1286
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:26,680
And just in case...

1287
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:29,680
you know, your brain ain't working so good

1288
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:32,680
all this happens pretty soon.

1289
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,680
And you ain't ready.

1290
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,690
You're nowhere near in shape.

1291
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:43,680
So I said, for God's sake.

1292
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:44,700
Why don't you stand up

1293
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:46,700
and fight this guy hard

1294
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:51,690
like ya done before? ! That was beautiful!

1295
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:56,700
But don't sit down in front of him like this!

1296
01:18:56,740 --> 01:19:00,700
Like, I don't know, some kind of mongrel or something.

1297
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:05,710
Because he's gonna kick your face in pieces!

1298
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:10,710
This guy just don't wanna win. He wants to bury you.

1299
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,720
He wants to humiliate you. He wants to prove to the whole world

1300
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,730
that it was nothing

1301
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,720
but some kind of a freak the first time out!

1302
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:19,730
And he said you're

1303
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,720
a one-time lucky bum!

1304
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,740
I don't

1305
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:31,740
I don't want to get mad

1306
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:35,740
in a BiblicaI place like this.

1307
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:40,740
But I think you're a hell of a lot more than that, kid!

1308
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:50,750
But if you want to blow it.

1309
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,760
If you want to blow this thing

1310
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,760
damn it, I'm gonna blow it with you.

1311
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,770
If you wanna stay here, I'll stay with you.

1312
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,770
I'll stay with you.

1313
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:05,770
I'll stay with you.

1314
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:13,770
I'll stay and pray. What I got to lose?

1315
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,800
It's gonna be okay.

1316
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,860
There ain't no other traiI to the ranch,

1317
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,870
or no shorter one.

1318
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,860
Oh yes, there is, When I was a kid,

1319
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:44,860
I helped my old man traiI some cattle up from the border.

1320
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:48,880
Can you hear me, Adrian?

1321
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:52,870
Keep listening. Keep listening.

1322
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,880
After breakfast, Bruce watched the party get away on the chase.

1323
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,880
He saw Cora and Kay and Bud

1324
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:06,900
start up the valley 15 minutes ahead of the others.

1325
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:09,900
At the last minute, the girl

1326
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:14,890
replied, Olga, Buck Mason, who is he?

1327
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,930
I just wrote this thing for you, Adrian.

1328
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:42,930
Maybe you'll like it.

1329
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:45,940
I'll just read it.

1330
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:48,940
Remember when we was on ice-skates

1331
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:51,940
And I thought you was supposed to be great

1332
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:53,940
But I kept giving you lip,

1333
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:55,950
And you kept trying to slip

1334
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:58,950
So I could catch you.

1335
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,950
And that was our first date

1336
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:01,950
And after that

1337
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:03,950
every day was great.

1338
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:08,950
So now, I want ya to know, That wherever you go

1339
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:12,950
Atlantic City or in the snow

1340
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,970
Don't worry 'bout a thing,

1341
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,970
Because as long as I got this ring

1342
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,960
I'll always be there to catch you.

1343
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:38,040
I knew you'd come back.

1344
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:50,050
Thanks, God!

1345
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,060
Anybody want a refill?

1346
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:55,070
Adrian, it costs six bucks a bottle.

1347
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:58,070
I don't need that. I ain't drinking now.

1348
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,070
You mean you haven't seen the baby?

1349
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,070
No, come on. I was waiting to see him together.

1350
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:04,070
You know, the kid's a winner.

1351
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:07,080
He's got full arms like you, Mickey.

1352
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:12,070
Here he is now. Look.

1353
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:18,080
My baby!

1354
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:23,080
Is that it?

1355
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:26,100
I can't believe it! He's ours?

1356
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:29,100
He's really ours? Thank you.

1357
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:32,100
Adrian, I can't believe you done this!

1358
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:34,100
Believe me, we did.

1359
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:38,100
What do you wanna call him?

1360
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:41,110
Paulie's a great name.

1361
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:43,110
Paul, Paulie's a pretty good name.

1362
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:45,120
What about after the father?

1363
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:47,120
Rocky Junior?

1364
01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:49,120
Come on, you really want to do that?

1365
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:55,120
Adrian, he's the best I've ever seen.

1366
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,130
You look so tired.

1367
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,130
Why don't you go get some sleep?

1368
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:04,120
No, no. I feel great. Listen, I've been thinking.

1369
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:06,140
If you don't want me mixing with Creed no more

1370
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:10,130
we'll make out some other kinda way, you know.

1371
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,140
There's one thing I want you to do for me.

1372
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:13,140
What?

1373
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:15,150
Come here.

1374
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,150
What?

1375
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:20,140
Win!

1376
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,150
Win!

1377
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:27,150
What're we waiting for? Take this!

1378
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:06,190
Faster! Faster!

1379
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:09,200
Keep moving, keep moving!

1380
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:10,200
Faster!

1381
01:27:10,230 --> 01:27:13,190
Pick 'em up! Pace doubles.

1382
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:19,210
That's it.

1383
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,210
That's it.

1384
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,210
Speed! Speed!

1385
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:24,210
Come on!

1386
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:26,220
Don't give up!

1387
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:28,220
Come on

1388
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,220
44 45

1389
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:36,230
46 47

1390
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:39,230
48 49

1391
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:07,250
Don't give up! Get that other out of you!

1392
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:10,260
Push!

1393
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:20,260
41 42 43

1394
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,270
46 47

1395
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:27,270
Push! Again!

1396
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:33,270
Left. Right.

1397
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,290
I did it!

1398
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:44,280
That's speed!

1399
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:47,300
Speed! Speed!

1400
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:16,320
Good night.

1401
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,460
I made it!

1402
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:50,470
Rocky!

1403
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,530
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Bill Baldwin speaking to you

1404
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:44,530
from the magnificent Spectrum,

1405
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:45,540
here in Philadelphia

1406
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:47,540
the site of Superfight Two

1407
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:50,530
with Rocky Balboa, the challenger,

1408
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:54,530
of course, Apollo Creed, the world champion.

1409
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:55,550
My sidekick and partner again tonight, Stu Nahan.

1410
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:56,540
Thank you, Bill.

1411
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:01,540
we're gonna see a real great battle, in every sense of the word.

1412
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:08,560
Don't worry about nothing.

1413
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,560
It's okay.

1414
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,560
I gotta go.

1415
01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:22,570
Adrian, I wish the doctor'd let you go to this fight.

1416
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:25,570
Me too.

1417
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:29,570
You're the man. You're Number One. The champ, the best of all time.

1418
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:32,580
The girIs love you. Men will always love you.

1419
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:35,590
You're the best. You're the man. And he's yours.

1420
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,590
This bum shouldn't even be in the same ring with you.

1421
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:41,590
I want you to show him who you are tonight.

1422
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:43,600
Show him who you are. Stick him!

1423
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:53,600
Rocky

1424
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,610
Listen, Paulie, you're gonna help out with the baby tonight.

1425
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:03,610
You just take care of everything now,

1426
01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:05,620
You're gonna be late for your fight.

1427
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:06,620
Everything's gonna be fine.

1428
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:07,620
Maybe I better go fight now.

1429
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:08,620
I love you.

1430
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:12,610
And I love you, too.

1431
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,620
Adrian, I wish you could go.

1432
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:16,630
The doctor said, no.

1433
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:21,620
Take care.Good luck.

1434
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:42,640
The champion has let it be known that he is in the best shape of his illustrious career.

1435
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:45,660
Rocky Balboa

1436
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:47,660
is a five-to-one underdog.

1437
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:49,660
Still a street brawler from Philadelphia.

1438
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:51,660
But can he repeat that

1439
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:54,660
incredible performance of 10 months ago?

1440
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:58,660
He took a real beating at the hands of the champion.

1441
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:04,670
Father Carmine!

1442
01:35:04,710 --> 01:35:07,680
Hey, Father Carmine, you home?

1443
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:10,680
Father Carmine!

1444
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:11,680
Rocky?

1445
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,680
It's me, Rocky Balboa.

1446
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,690
Rocky? Yes.

1447
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,690
I'm going to the fight right now.

1448
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:23,690
But I was wondering if you could do me a small favor, you know?

1449
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,700
It's about the fight, you know.

1450
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:29,700
Now I got the family and the baby and all that stuff.

1451
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:31,700
if you could throw down a blessing.

1452
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:36,690
So if I get beat up tonight it won't be too bad, you know.

1453
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:38,690
Could you do something like that?

1454
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:45,720
Thanks a lot, Father. I appreciate it.

1455
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:46,720
I gotta go. I'm so late.

1456
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:51,710
I'll see ya in church, I hope. Take care.

1457
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:09,740
Hey, Rocky.

1458
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:11,740
Good luck, son.

1459
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:13,740
Where you been? You lost your brains or something?

1460
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:16,750
We got a fight here tonight, remember?

1461
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:18,750
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm here.

1462
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:21,750
Get dressed, will you?

1463
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:23,750
There are many rumors about this fight.

1464
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:26,760
The most obvious being a definite desire

1465
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:29,760
for Apollo to draw first blood, to end it quickly.

1466
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:32,760
This would prove his claim that the last fight was a fluke.

1467
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,760
Lightning! Thunder!

1468
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,760
Hurricane! Hurricane!

1469
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:45,780
You're gonna get him.

1470
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:48,770
He's ours. He's ours.

1471
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:56,780
It's time, kid.

1472
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:03,790
Okay, let's do it.

1473
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:05,790
All right, I'm ready.

1474
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,800
I think I'm starting to get a headache here.

1475
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:17,800
No, you are in perfect working condition.

1476
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,810
You look real good, too.

1477
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,810
And you look perfect.

1478
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,810
Hey, Mick

1479
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:24,810
In case I don't get a chance,

1480
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:25,810
I just wanna say

1481
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:27,820
I'm gonna be trying hard for you today, okay?

1482
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:29,820
Thank you.

1483
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:31,820
Ain't this robe nice?

1484
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:34,820
It's better than the last one. Remember that baggy one?

1485
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:36,820
This is gorgeous. It's perfect.

1486
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:38,820
It's real cute. I like it.

1487
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:46,840
Here's Rocky Balboa heading toward the ring now.

1488
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:51,830
known to millions as The Italian Stallion

1489
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,840
Why this fighter of limited ability

1490
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:55,850
has gained such popularity

1491
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,850
is such a mystery.

1492
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:02,840
Rocky Balboa!

1493
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:04,850
And the crowds here in this section are beginning to chant his name.

1494
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:05,860
He has an awfuI lot of backers here.

1495
01:38:05,890 --> 01:38:07,860
Balboa is wearing a black-and-gold robe.

1496
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:09,860
He wore a red one the last time

1497
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:11,860
from that meat-packing plant.

1498
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,860
Some said that was from the high school

1499
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:18,860
that he never graduated from Thirty-one years of age.

1500
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:22,860
And we're waiting now for the champion to come into the ring.

1501
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:27,870
Rocky!

1502
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:29,880
The arena's certainly packed with Rocky's people.

1503
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:32,880
I've never seen so many Italians in one place in my life.

1504
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:33,880
You said it, I didn't say it.

1505
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,890
Rocky! Rocky!

1506
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,890
These people are for you, Rocky!

1507
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:38,890
I appreciate it.

1508
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,890
Are you ready in here? I think so.

1509
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:41,890
Tonight's our night, kid.

1510
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:45,880
By the sound of the crowd,the champion is just now coming into the Spectrum.

1511
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:47,900
And the champion, Apollo Creed.

1512
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:52,890
He looks a little more determined this time than he did the last time!

1513
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:54,900
It's Apollo.Who'd ya expect?

1514
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:59,900
I was hoping he wouldn't show.

1515
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:05,920
And now, the champion is climbing into the ring

1516
01:39:05,950 --> 01:39:09,910
very determined-looking, very serious right now.

1517
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:12,920
Rocky doesn't look as confident as he might.

1518
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,920
Apollo Creed, the master of disaster!

1519
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,920
You going down, man! You going down!

1520
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:26,940
Don't let it bother you, kid.

1521
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:29,940
Wouldn't it bother you?

1522
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:32,940
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1523
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:37,940
And welcome to the Philadelphia Spectrum.

1524
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:40,950
This is the main event of the evening:

1525
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:45,940
Fifteen rounds, the Heavyweight Championship of the world.

1526
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:51,960
In the black corner,

1527
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,960
the challenger weighing 202 pounds.

1528
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,960
From the great fighting city of Philadelphia

1529
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,960
The ltalian Stallion, Rocky Balboa.

1530
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:25,980
a champion

1531
01:40:26,030 --> 01:40:29,000
who needs no introduction anywhere in the civilized world.

1532
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:32,000
The true master of disaster

1533
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:37,000
the undefeated Heavyweight Champion of the world

1534
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:44,000
the one, the only, Apollo Creed.

1535
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:52,010
Referee Lou Filippo will give the instructions.

1536
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,030
I'm gonna give you

1537
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:04,030
the instructions now.

1538
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:06,040
I expect you to follow them.

1539
01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:09,040
Watch your low punches

1540
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:10,040
and watch your kidney punches.

1541
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:11,040
Watch your rabbit punches.

1542
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:13,040
In case of a knockdown,

1543
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,040
you go to the corner I tell you to

1544
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,050
and stay there until I tell you to come out. Understand?

1545
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:20,040
Okay, boys, let's have a good fight.

1546
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,040
You're going down.

1547
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:28,060
Good luck to you.

1548
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:29,060
He's still upset.

1549
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:31,060
Who cares? Now listen, protect that eye.

1550
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:35,060
And no matter what happens don't go back to fighting southpaw till I tell you.

1551
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:36,070
Now, you get him, son.

1552
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:37,070
Rocky, good luck.

1553
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:39,070
Now, he's gonna try to kill you quick.

1554
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:43,070
If you get through this first round, then he's ours!

1555
01:41:43,110 --> 01:41:46,070
Show him who you are.

1556
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:53,080
Rocky Balboa prays in his corner. The champion dancing over in his corner.

1557
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:58,080
We're just seconds away from the fight of the century, Superfight Two.

1558
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:04,080
The champion comes over in a hurry and throws a couple of rights and lefts.

1559
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:06,100
He starts to take command early here.

1560
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:10,090
And now, he's kind of hauling speed around the ring.

1561
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:12,100
Rocky's holding that right hand.

1562
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:14,100
He's fighting right-handed.

1563
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:15,100
I don't believe it.

1564
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:20,100
The Southpaw from Philly, he is fighting right-handed!

1565
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:26,100
Rocky!

1566
01:42:26,150 --> 01:42:31,110
Rocky!

1567
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:36,130
Break that damn jab!

1568
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:40,120
Protect that eye!

1569
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:45,120
Is that all you got? You ain't got nothing!

1570
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:47,140
You ready to lay down?

1571
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:49,140
A go right, a go left.

1572
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:51,140
Another right and another right!

1573
01:42:51,170 --> 01:42:54,140
Creed out with a right hand. Take it, Balboa.

1574
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:56,150
Now he's in the corner.

1575
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:58,150
And those left and right hits are coming back at him.

1576
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:01,150
A lot of lefts and a right to the head.

1577
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:03,150
Balboa appears to be getting hit often.

1578
01:43:03,190 --> 01:43:06,160
But he seems to be in pretty good condition right now.

1579
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:09,160
Balboa is in trouble now.

1580
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:13,160
He's in trouble, taking rights and lefts from the champion.

1581
01:43:13,190 --> 01:43:16,150
It is a tremendous fight

1582
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:23,160
Balboa is down

1583
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:25,170
We see Apollo's hit that bad left eye,

1584
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:28,180
remember,from the first fight? It was the eye that was cut the last time.

1585
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:30,180
Balboa's getting up.

1586
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:32,180
Go get him!

1587
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:36,170
Go after him, kid! Go after him!

1588
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:40,180
The champion starts to move in again,

1589
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:42,190
throwing rights and lefts

1590
01:43:42,230 --> 01:43:46,180
Balboa right into the cord.

1591
01:43:46,230 --> 01:43:48,200
Come on! Balboa!

1592
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:53,190
Balboa's tags: Left, left and right combinations by the champion.

1593
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:58,200
It's the end of the round.

1594
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:03,210
There's a lot of bad blood between these two.

1595
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:05,210
Good round. Good round.

1596
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:07,220
I can't believe it.

1597
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,220
He broke my nose again.

1598
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:10,220
Balboa's gotta be in great shape

1599
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:13,220
to withstand that butchering.

1600
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:15,220
And I'll tell you just what it is, it's a plain old butchering.

1601
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:18,230
Did the switching bother you?

1602
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:20,230
All right, then you should've had him.

1603
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:22,230
you can't be hurt, Because you are too tough!

1604
01:44:22,270 --> 01:44:24,230
Now, don't let up on this man. This man is dangerous.

1605
01:44:24,270 --> 01:44:28,230
This man is danger! I am dangerous!

1606
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:29,240
That guy's great.

1607
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:31,240
Listen, he's only a man.

1608
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:32,240
You can beat him

1609
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,240
because you're a tank.

1610
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,250
You're a greasy, fast, 200-pound

1611
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:38,250
Italian tank.

1612
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,250
Go to him! Run over him!

1613
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:42,250
I'm a tank. I'm gonna get him!

1614
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:47,250
Here we go, round 2.

1615
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:50,260
The champion comes back out.

1616
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:52,260
He's leading across again starting with the left to the left,to the left.

1617
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:55,260
Left to the chin. Left to the head. Left to the chin. Left to the head.

1618
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:57,270
He's coming on now. They're pulling out that right hand.

1619
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:00,270
He's just waiting for that precise moment that he wants. There it is!

1620
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:05,260
And here comes Balboa!

1621
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:08,280
You can't hurt me. He can't hurt me, no way!

1622
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:12,270
Break it up. Break it up.

1623
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,280
Break it up. Break free.

1624
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:16,290
Now the champion holds Balboa.

1625
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:19,290
You're too slow! Man, you're too slow!

1626
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:21,290
Get your cameras ready.

1627
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,280
Watch this, man, watch this!

1628
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:26,290
He's going down.

1629
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:39,300
Get up, Rocky, get up!

1630
01:45:39,340 --> 01:45:43,300
Balboa for the second time is down, struggling to get up.

1631
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:47,310
Just stay down there, chump.

1632
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:50,320
Beautiful. Beautiful.

1633
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:52,320
Seven...eight....

1634
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:54,320
Protect that eye, kid!

1635
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,330
Get at it! Your body!

1636
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,330
You're a tank, kid.

1637
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:02,320
I told you.

1638
01:46:02,370 --> 01:46:04,330
Here comes the champion

1639
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:05,330
One, two. One, two.

1640
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:06,340
But here it is. A left and a right,

1641
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:07,340
and he's got him back in the corner.

1642
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:11,330
Balboa's back in the corner.

1643
01:46:11,370 --> 01:46:13,340
Here comes Balboa again. Where does he get that stamina?

1644
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:15,340
He's got the champion trapped over in the corner.

1645
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:18,350
Rocky!

1646
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:21,350
Rocky!

1647
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:26,340
Rocky!

1648
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:35,350
Keep it up! Keep it up!

1649
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:36,370
Come on.

1650
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,370
Break it up.

1651
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:40,370
I'm standing here.

1652
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,370
And they're taunting each other.

1653
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:45,360
The battle, the round is over.But they're taunting each other!

1654
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:46,380
Everybody in the audience get ready

1655
01:46:46,410 --> 01:46:51,370
for World War III!

1656
01:46:51,410 --> 01:46:53,380
I ain't goin' down no more.

1657
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:56,390
That a boy. Go get him.

1658
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:13,400
Come on boys, break it up. Break it.

1659
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:17,400
Break it up.

1660
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:22,400
The champion again, with a combination of lefts and rights to the head

1661
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:24,410
That was another round for Creed.

1662
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:27,420
Creed's just piling up the points.

1663
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:32,410
Hit him, Rocky!

1664
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:37,430
Hit him!

1665
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:40,420
Hit him! Just hit him!

1666
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:48,430
Another round for Apollo Creed.

1667
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:56,430
Come on, Rocky!

1668
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,450
Creed's in the corner.

1669
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:03,440
Left and right to the midsection. Those hurt.

1670
01:48:06,490 --> 01:48:09,460
Hold that body.

1671
01:48:09,490 --> 01:48:10,460
He's won another round.

1672
01:48:10,490 --> 01:48:14,450
He now begins to pound Balboa's head.

1673
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:19,460
Get out!

1674
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:38,480
Get out!

1675
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:45,490
I'm gonna give that round to Balboa.

1676
01:48:45,530 --> 01:48:48,500
You wonder what's on Apollo Creed's mind right now.

1677
01:48:48,530 --> 01:48:53,490
He's lost his first round.

1678
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:59,500
Go for it, Rocky!

1679
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:07,510
Looks great.

1680
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:14,520
Come on.

1681
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:17,530
Come on! Hands up! Now just stick and move!

1682
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,530
This man is breaking you up inside. Stick and move!

1683
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:22,520
Keep your hands up.

1684
01:49:42,590 --> 01:49:47,550
Hit him back!

1685
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:49,560
He took a beating 10 months ago,

1686
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:53,550
but tonight, it's twice as bad.

1687
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:58,560
Another round for the champion, Apollo Creed.

1688
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,570
The left eye is closed.

1689
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:04,570
Now bust him, understand? Keep working on him.

1690
01:50:04,610 --> 01:50:05,570
Stay away from him.

1691
01:50:05,610 --> 01:50:07,580
Don't let him breathe.

1692
01:50:07,610 --> 01:50:12,570
Get him!

1693
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:18,590
Come on.

1694
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:23,580
God!

1695
01:50:24,630 --> 01:50:28,590
Balboa's taking another beating in the corner.

1696
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:32,590
Another round for the champion.

1697
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:37,600
Rocky! Rocky!

1698
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:12,640
Now you gotta beat him on points. You understand? !

1699
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:13,640
Now, stick and move!

1700
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:15,640
He's gonna fall.

1701
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:16,650
Don't go for the knockout!

1702
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:18,650
How's that eye, now?

1703
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:19,650
It works!

1704
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:21,650
You can't do much more with that, can you?

1705
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:22,650
I know what I'm doing!

1706
01:51:22,690 --> 01:51:24,650
You get in trouble one more time, I'm gonna stop

1707
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:26,660
Please don't stop nothing.

1708
01:51:26,690 --> 01:51:30,650
Let me stop it because you're getting killed!

1709
01:51:30,690 --> 01:51:31,660
It's my life!

1710
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:33,660
Apollo's well ahead.

1711
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:35,660
All he has to do is stay away and he retains the title.

1712
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:37,670
Just stick and move, you understand? !

1713
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,670
Just stick and move!

1714
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:40,670
It ain't gonna be like last time.

1715
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:41,670
Switch now to southpaw anyway, will you?

1716
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:43,670
No tricks, I ain't switching.

1717
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:44,670
But you're fading out, kid.

1718
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:45,670
I don't need no tricks!

1719
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:47,680
All right! Go with the right.

1720
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:49,680
You got a plan, you gotta switch, kid.

1721
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:51,680
He's ready, believe me.

1722
01:51:51,710 --> 01:51:53,680
Apollo, don't go for the knockout.

1723
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:57,680
They've come to the center of the ring for the 15th and final round.

1724
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:00,690
You're going down. No, no way.

1725
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,690
Here we go. Let's see what Creed does here now.

1726
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:07,690
Creed is starting to move in on Balboa. He's going for the knockdown.

1727
01:52:07,730 --> 01:52:12,690
The champion comes off jabbing with that left hand. Sticking the left hand out.

1728
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:17,700
Now! Now!

1729
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:20,710
Balboa has nearly floored the champ!

1730
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:24,700
His left hook caught the exhausted champ off guard!

1731
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:26,720
Creed doesn't know where he is. It's blind instinct.

1732
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:28,720
Balboa is staggering from exhaustion.

1733
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:30,720
Apollo is barely protecting himself.

1734
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:32,720
A right to the head of the champion.

1735
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:35,720
Another right! A left to the head!

1736
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:39,720
Stay away from him!

1737
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:40,730
Balboa tries to stay away,

1738
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:43,730
but now it is Creed coming back. Creed with the left hand.

1739
01:52:43,770 --> 01:52:46,740
Go for it! What're you waiting for? !

1740
01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:48,740
What's keeping these two guys up?

1741
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:53,740
Now!

1742
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:54,740
Here comes Balboa.

1743
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:56,750
But the champ came back with another left!

1744
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:01,750
Get away from him!

1745
01:53:01,780 --> 01:53:03,750
Where are they getting it, I don't know!

1746
01:53:03,790 --> 01:53:06,760
A right hand! A right hand! It's Creed.

1747
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:08,760
Now it's Balboa!

1748
01:53:08,790 --> 01:53:10,760
It's Creed.

1749
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:11,760
A tremendous,

1750
01:53:11,790 --> 01:53:13,760
tough fight.

1751
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:18,760
They're sending deadness up to the ring!

1752
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,770
Rocky!

1753
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:24,770
Come on! Good!

1754
01:53:24,810 --> 01:53:25,770
Rocky

1755
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:56,810
Creed will retain the title if he's up.

1756
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:02,810
Then Creed will win the title automatically!

1757
01:54:04,850 --> 01:54:05,810
Get up, my man!

1758
01:54:05,850 --> 01:54:08,820
Get on your feet!

1759
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:15,820
Now Rocky Balboa reaches for another....

1760
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:17,830
Get up! Rocky! Get up!

1761
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:19,830
Balboa's trying to get up

1762
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:21,830
Now the champ is trying to get up.

1763
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:25,830
The champ can't make it! He slips down again.

1764
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:31,840
He is trying to get up!

1765
01:54:31,870 --> 01:54:32,840
Get Up!

1766
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,850
The champ is still on one knee! Get up!

1767
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:44,840
It's over! He won! Balboa just legally did it!

1768
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:48,860
Rocky has shocked the world!

1769
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:52,850
He is the new Heavyweight Champion of the world.

1770
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:54,860
Ladies and gentlemen,

1771
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:59,860
in a stunning upset scoring the winning-point knockout

1772
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:05,860
the new Heavyweight Champion of the world, Rocky

1773
01:55:05,910 --> 01:55:06,880
You're great.

1774
01:55:06,910 --> 01:55:10,870
Rocky Balboa

1775
01:55:10,910 --> 01:55:13,880
Good luck.

1776
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,890
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1777
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:21,880
I can't believe this has happened. I can't.

1778
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:23,890
And I just wanna say thanks to Apollo.

1779
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:26,900
For fighting me, Apollo.

1780
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:31,890
I wanna thank Mickey for training me....

1781
01:55:31,930 --> 01:55:33,900
We love you, Rocky!

1782
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:37,900
And I love you, too!

1783
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:42,900
Most of all, I wanna thank God.

1784
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:46,900
Except for my kid being born

1785
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:48,920
this is the greatest night

1786
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:51,920
in the history of my life.

1787
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:56,910
I just wanna say one thing to my wife who's home.

1788
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,930
Adrian, I did it!

1789
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,930
I love you. I love you.
