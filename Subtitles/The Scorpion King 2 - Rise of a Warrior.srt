Good.
Then riches and glory will be yours.

But Mathayus
betray me even once

167
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,240
and you will pray to the gods
for a quick death.

168

I'm a quick learner I hope.

Bring in the prisoner.

178
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,360
He was overheard
slandering my name.

179
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,990
And the punishment is death.

180

Wait. But this is my...
I know.

181

You do the deed yourself

182
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,770
you prove your loyalty to me
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

183

I'll permit you
to make it quick.

Is this true?

186
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,120
Did you slander the king?

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,360
Mathayus! Please!

188

Answer me!

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,870

Yes.

what's coming to you.

192

but your family as well.

and hurricanes.

290

You know this may come
as a shock to you

291
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,920
but not everything
in the world happens because of you.

292
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,580
Then why are you
going to Egypt?

293
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,990
Because...

294
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,550
Everyone should go and see the pyramids
once in their lives.

295
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,300
Why are you going to Egypt?

296
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,130
Personal matters

297
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,600
which don't concern you.

298
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,930
Don't play coy with me.
You know I'll get it out of you anyway.

299
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,240
All right.

300
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,680
My father once fought for the pharaoh's
private guard and saved his life.

301
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,280
So I'm going to ask if in return
he'll let me borrow

302
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,350
the Spear of Osiris
to help me defeat Sargon.

303
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,250
The Pharaoh of Egypt

304
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,230
is going to lend one of the most
fabled weapons in history

305
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,360
to a 19-year-old kid
he's never even heard of?

306
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,230
I don't remember
asking your opinion.

307
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,930
Actually

308
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,370
I'm afraid she's right.
It wouldn't work.

309
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,010
But mainly for the simple reason
that the Spear of Osiris

310
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,980
is only effective
against Egyptian monsters.

311
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:04,580
Such as the winged scarab
sphinxes and cursed mummies.

312
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,850
And you know this how?

313
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,950
Let's just say
I'm well connected.

314
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,360
Really? And who
are you exactly?

315
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,790
Aristophanes of Naxos.

316
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,500
Not to be confused with the Aristophanes
from Corinth. That hack.

317
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,560
I speak 20 languages fluently
and another 20 passably.

318
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,510
So if you need
any translation services...

319
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,740
Yes yes. How did you learn
about the Spear of Osiris?

320
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,210
I am a poet and playwright by trade
and sometimes a musician.

321
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,980
And was most recently
court poet to the king of Elam.

322
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,120
Petty despot. May he rot in the
underworld for his lack of esthetic taste.

323
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,390
And learned of it from one of
his high priests.

324
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,400
But you are thinking
along the right path.

325
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,200
To defeat a man like Sargon
well-versed in the black arts

326
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:54,100
one would require
a potent weapon indeed.

327
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,770
Like?

328
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,780
Let's see.

329
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,010
There's the Hammer of Zeus.
No too unwieldy.

330
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,740
The Shield of Cronos.
That's completely discredited.

331
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,150
The Cloak of...

332
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,750
I've got it!
The Sword of Damocles!

333
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,090
The what?

334
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,090
Damocles. You know.

335
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,720
The one condemned to die
a thousand deaths

336
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,630
by the very hand of the sword that he used
to kill King Philpman.

337
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,570
(GROANS)

338
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,540
What do they teach you
in Akkadian schools these days?

339
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,040
Not to touch
other men's swords.

340
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,610
Well in any case

341
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,670
according to Book Five of
Herodotus' <i>Histories</i>

342
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,650
Damocles' infamous sword was transformed
by a lightning bolt from Zeus

343
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,750
into a wondrous weapon whose blade
could cut through anything.

344
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,850
Mortal or immortal.

345
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,460
And presented as a gift
to the Queen of the Underworld.

346
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,330
You're saying this sword
can cut through anything?

347
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,840
Oh please.

348
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,870
Anything.

349
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,470
And you know
where this sword is?

350
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,140
This has to be the most harebrained
scheme I've heard yet today

351
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,340
and that is saying plenty.

352
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,780
Oh and you
have a better idea.

353
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,850
Okay. I've decided.

354
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,490
We're gonna continue
on our journey to Knossos.

355
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,650
And you're gonna lead me
to the Sword of Damocles.

356
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,360
My friend such a journey would be
fraught with perils.

357
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,460
The Underworld is a grim and
dangerous place of condemned souls

358
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,530
suffering unspeakable...

359
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,600
How much do you want?

360
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,800
Exclusive rights to compose
an epic ode of your quest

361
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,900
and one hundred silver staters
for expenses.

362
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,040
Wait. A hundred?

363
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,780
For risking my life
it's a pittance.

364
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,950
A lady doesn't part
with her dowry that easily.

365
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,480
Here we go.

366
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,260
First of all
I'm coming along.

367
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,420
Wait. Forget it.

368
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,130
Second you will treat me with respect
and as your equal.

369
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,500
If not your superior.

370
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:07,870
LAYLA: Thirty-fifth you will launder my
undergarments daily in fresh rosewater.

371
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,750
Forty-seventh you will bathe and
rub my feet with olive oil once a day.

372
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,380
Don't push it.

373
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,620
Hey Greek.

374
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,960
Call me Ari my sweet.

375
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,160
In case you get any funny ideas
about losing us

376
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,360
or making off with my money
just remember this.

377
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,340
Akkadian women are just as handy with
a dagger as Akkadian men.

378
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,640
I'm sure that's not the only thing
you're handy at fair maiden

379
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,910
whose beauty makes even
goddesses blush with envy.

380
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,670
Hey save your flowery words
for your scribblings.

381
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,370
Focus on the task at hand

382
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,080
which is getting
us into that.

383
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,780
Alive.

384
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,560
Of course.

385
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,950
(WHISPERING) Perhaps Layla here might use
her feminine wiles

386
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,220
to distract the guards
whilst we slip past them.

387
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,240
This I have to see.

388
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,500
Hi boys.
Nice night isn't it?

389
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,200
GUARD: Concubines around back.

390

She is quite the charmer

00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,370
isn't she?

392
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,250
You should see her
in a bad mood.

393
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,480
Hmm.

Come on let's go.

396
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,570
These keys
should get us into the palace.

397
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,630
But then we need
to find the labyrinth.

398
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,440
The portal to the Underworld
lies within the labyrinth.

399
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,840

The Minotaur.

A creature
half man half bull.

428
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,130
A crazed monster whose appetite must
be satisfied daily with human flesh.

429
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,320
King Minos believes that the Minotaur
protects the city
