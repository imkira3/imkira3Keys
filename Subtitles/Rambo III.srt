3
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,159
Do you know him?

4
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:49,300
Rambo!

5
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:42,092
Rambo! Rambo.

6
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,795
John!

7
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:49,302
John.

8
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,529
John!

9
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:22,633
John Rambo!

10
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:30,146
I don't believe this.

11
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,745
So where did you come from?
Washington.

12
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:42,974
Good to see you again.
Yeah, you too.

13
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,285
Do you want to tell me about it?

14
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:49,508
About what?

15
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:53,360
How about yesterday, I've seen you stick
fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok.

16
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:56,066
You saw that?
Yeah.

17
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:59,679
And today I find you
working in a monastery.

18
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:03,519
They let me live here
and I help out, fixing things.

19
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:05,221
And the stick fighting?

20
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:08,772
I just do that for a
little extra money.

21
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:10,311
Yeah I...

22
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:12,817
...saw you give it
to the monks.

23
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:14,609
You see a lot.

24
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:19,200
Colonel, who are they?

25
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:21,321
They're partly the
reason I'm here.

26
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,820
Bob!

27
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,002
This is Robert Griggs,

28
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:27,370
he's a field officer
with our local embassy.

29
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:28,569
John Rambo.

30
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:30,614
Pleasure.

31
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,488
Well, You're certainly
not easy to find.

32
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,890
Why are you keeping track?

33
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:38,959
Well, like the Colonel says,
good men are hard to find.

34
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:45,767
John, I'd like you to take a
look at some of these photos.

35
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:48,462
I don't know how much
you know about Afghanistan.

36
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,320
Most people can't
even find it on a map.

37
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,623
But over two million civilians,

38
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,680
mostly peasant farmers
and their families

39
00:09:56,782 --> 00:10:00,116
have been systematically
slaughtered by invading Russian armies.

40
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:02,784
Every new weapon,

41
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:09,877
including chemical warfare,
has been used to eliminate these people.

42
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:12,839
And they've been very successful,
on many levels.

43
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:17,775
I assume that you're out of touch
with the current status of the war,

44
00:10:18,415 --> 00:10:20,122
but after nine years of fighting,

45
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,105
the Afghan Forces are now getting
shipments Stinger missiles,

46
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:25,977
and are beginning to hold their
own against the air strikes.

47
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,880
Except for one region,
50 miles over the border.

48
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:34,015
Apparently, the Soviet commander
there is exceptionally brutal,

49
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:36,063
as those photos indicate.

50
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:39,923
And he's managed strangle
off all aid from the outside.

51
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:43,758
So, we want to

52
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,991
investigate the problem
firsthand.

53
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,204
And what's that got
to do with me?

54
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:52,874
They've asked me to go in.

55
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:54,574
You're not gonna do it?

56
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:58,541
Yes, and I want you
to come with me, John.

57
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,798
I put in my time.

58
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:02,105
What's that mean?

59
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:05,430
It means my war is over.

60
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:19,189
I thought you said he
was this great soldier.

61
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,811
Well, Colonel...

62
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:25,360
...looks like we got a
long walk down those stairs.

63
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:44,663
Don't be down on him,
just following orders.

64
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:48,094
This mission's important, John.

65
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:50,344
Do you really think we are
gonna make a difference?

66
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:52,051
If I didn't,
I wouldn't be going.

67
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:55,158
It didn't before.
That was another time.

68
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,483
Come with me, John.

69
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,521
I don't know what you
think about this place,

70
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:07,467
but I like it.

71
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:12,260
I like bein' here, I like workin' here.,
I like belong into something.

72
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:15,291
You do belong to something.
Not this.

73
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:18,453
When you're gonna
come full circle?

74
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:20,082
What are you talking about?

75
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:24,837
You said that your war is over.
I think that the one out there is,

76
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:26,944
but not the one inside you.

77
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:30,847
I know the reasons you're here, John,
but it doesn't work that way.

78
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:35,031
You may try, but you can't get
away from what you really are.

79
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:38,050
And what do you think I am?
A full-blooded combat soldier.

80
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,499
Not any more.
I don't want it.

81
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,017
That's too bad, 'cause
you're stuck with it.

82
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:45,191
Let me tell you a story, John.

83
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:49,367
There was a sculptor and he
found this stone, a special stone.

84
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:51,887
He dragged it home and
he worked on it for months...

85
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:53,774
...until he finally finished.

86
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:55,588
When he was ready,
he showed it to his friends,

87
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,439
and they said he had
created a great statue.

88
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,894
The sculptor said he
hadn't created anything.

89
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:03,049
The statue was always there.

90
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:06,052
He just cleared away
the small pieces.

91
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:10,216
We didn't make you
this fighting machine.

92
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:13,327
We just chipped away
the rough edges.

93
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:16,300
You're always gonna be
tearing away at yourself...

94
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:18,803
...until you come to terms
with what you are!

95
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:21,401
Until you come full circle.

96
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:26,198
I guess I'm not ready yet.

97
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:34,020
Well, I got to move.

98
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:39,536
Promise me you'll look me
up when you get stateside.

99
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:41,837
I promise.

100
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:43,420
Colonel!

101
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:48,042
I'm sorry, but it's got
to end for me sometime.

102
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,541
I understand.

103
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:18,089
Take cover!
Fire the rocket.

104
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:45,956
Drop your weapons
and remain where you are!

105
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:48,500
You cannot escape.

106
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:55,833
Drop your weapons.

107
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:58,394
You have no chance of escape.

108
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:02,167
Drop your weapons!

109
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:03,770
Now!

110
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,749
Rambo!

111
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,983
Something went wrong.
What happened?

112
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:38,299
Soviets intercepted the
team just over the border.

113
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:42,369
From what we've gathered,
Trautman and the rest of his party...

114
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,934
...have been taken to the
regional command post.

115
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:47,094
And what are you doing about it?

116
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:51,977
I can't do anything about it.
I'm sorry.

117
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:54,515
I just thought you should know.

118
00:16:56,384 --> 00:16:57,973
What about me?

119
00:17:00,137 --> 00:17:01,383
What about you?

120
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:03,045
Can you get me in?

121
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:05,119
You're not serious.

122
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:06,818
Oh yeah, I'm serious.

123
00:17:09,105 --> 00:17:12,002
It can't be done officially.
Make it unofficial.

124
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:17,033
If it can be done, I want you to
know upfront that if you captured,

125
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:19,164
or if any of this leaks,

126
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:23,175
we'll deny any participation or
even knowledge of your existence.

127
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:26,480
I'm used to it.

128
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:29,274
I'll get back to you.

129
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,772
You want to buy?
Many guns here!

130
00:18:57,814 --> 00:19:00,772
No. I'm looking
for Mousa Ghani.

131
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:04,511
What's your name?
John Rambo.

132
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:09,117
Wait here.

133
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,657
They sell many in Afghanistan.

134
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:37,352
Many land mines.

135
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:39,697
Land mines everywhere.

136
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:43,645
I am Mousa Ghani.
What is it you want?

137
00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:45,281
I was sent by Griggs.

138
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:48,928
You do not look like men
Griggs sent before.

139
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:51,908
You not look like you
are with military.

140
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:53,497
I'm not.

141
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:55,706
What you are? A mercenary?

142
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:58,144
No.

143
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,794
You're not with military. You're
not mercenary, what are you?

144
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,671
Lost tourist?

145
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:10,201
I'm no tourist.

146
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:13,310
Sorry.

147
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:15,227
Now, do you know
where the American is?

148
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:17,924
Yes. In a Soviet fort,

149
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,812
near the village of Khost,
30 miles over border.

150
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:25,193
Mr. Griggs send you
the supplies you asked for.

151
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:27,063
You wish to see them now?

152
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:28,163
Yeah.

153
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:33,780
Is this what you asked for?
Yeah.

154
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:37,002
Never seen these things before.
What are these?

155
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:40,255
Detonators.
And this?

156
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:42,344
What is this for?

157
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:44,966
It's a blue light.

158
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:46,586
What does it do?

159
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:48,884
Turns blue.

160
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,429
I see.

161
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:54,267
Can you tell me how many
more men come with us?

162
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:56,560
There's no rescue team.
It's just me.

163
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,063
Just you?
Come on, this is no good.

164
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:00,712
I can not take only
one man to the fort.

165
00:21:00,713 --> 00:21:02,598
You need more men to help.

166
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:06,276
Griggs said you'd take me in.
Take me in.

167
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:08,893
I am needed to take
medical supplies.

168
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,295
If I not take it,
many people will die.

169
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:12,311
Do you understand?

170
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:16,205
Well, I do not know
who you really are,

171
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:18,207
but by the way you look,
I can see you have...

172
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:20,145
...no experience in war.
Do you?

173
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:22,659
Come on, do you?

174
00:21:23,838 --> 00:21:25,464
I've fired a few shots.

175
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:30,958
A few shots?

176
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:34,534
Come on, maybe you
should go back home,

177
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:36,393
and think it all over again...

178
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:37,911
...for a very long time.

179
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:43,976
I did think it over.

180
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:46,517
You did?

181
00:21:47,947 --> 00:21:50,614
Well, this is your choice.

182
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:54,621
But let me tell you, you cannot
get this American alone.

183
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:58,031
If you fail, do not blame me.

184
00:21:58,457 --> 00:22:00,418
I will accept no responsibility.

185
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:03,922
Sounds familiar.

186
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:42,915
My name is Colonel Zaysen,
Regional Commander of this sector.

187
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:50,910
Do you realize you're the first
American captured in Afghanistan?

188
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,681
Congratulations.

189
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:58,392
I believe you're planning
to supply enemy rebel forces...

190
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:02,297
...with stinger missiles
 intended to destroy Soviet aircraft.

191
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,346
If I'm gonna be interrogated,

192
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:06,976
I wanna be interrogated
by your superiors.

193
00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:12,088
Out here, I have no superiors.

194
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,616
I am in full command.

195
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,247
You are alone here.

196
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,915
Abandoned by your government.

197
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:31,173
What do you want?
Cooperation.

198
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,438
This sector has been under
total control for over five years.

199
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,514
There is little more
I can do here.

200
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:48,145
It is, as you say,
without challenges.

201
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,870
If you supply to me
worthy information...

202
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:55,733
...about most stinger missiles
you're planning to deliver,

203
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:58,786
it could provide a way
out of this for us both.

204
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:04,158
After all, in the end
what everyone really wants...

205
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,959
...is peace.

206
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,379
The Kremlin's got a hell
of a sense of humor.

207
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,128
Please explain.

208
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:15,131
You talk peace and
disarmament to the world,

209
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:18,154
and here you are,
wiping out a race of people.

210
00:24:18,196 --> 00:24:21,222
We are wiping out no one.

211
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:26,474
I think you are too intelligent to
believe such absurd propaganda.

212
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,210
Now again:
where are the missiles?

213
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,130
I don't know anything
about any missiles!

214
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:33,018
Of course you do.

215
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,651
But you do not seem to realize
I'm providing a way out for us both.

216
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:38,108
You expect sympathy?

217
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:41,318
You started this damn war,
now you have to deal with it!

218
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:46,125
And we will. It is just a matter of time
before we achieve a complete victory.

219
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:47,680
You know there
won't be a victory.

220
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,754
Every day your war machines lose
ground to a bunch of poorly armed,

221
00:24:51,796 --> 00:24:53,782
poorly equipped freedom-fighters!

222
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:56,409
The fact is that you
underestimated your competition.

223
00:24:56,553 --> 00:24:57,795
If you'd studied your History,

224
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,263
you'd know that these people
have never given up to anyone.

225
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:04,473
They'd rather die than be
slaves to an invading army.

226
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:06,379
You can't defeat
a people like that.

227
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:09,778
We tried. We already
had our Vietnam.

228
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,072
Now you're gonna have yours.

229
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:16,823
So, you wish to test me.
Good.

230
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:58,045
This is Afghanistan.

231
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:01,256
Alexander the Great
tried to conquer this country,

232
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:05,997
then Genghis Khan,
then the British, now Russia.

233
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:09,722
But Afghan people fight hard,
they never be defeated.

234
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:12,963
Ancient enemy make prayer
about these people.

235
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,670
Do you wish to hear?

236
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:18,523
Very good. It says:

237
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,443
"May God deliver us
from the venom of the cobra,

238
00:26:21,444 --> 00:26:24,776
the teeth of the tiger and
the vengeance of the Afghan."

239
00:26:26,782 --> 00:26:28,484
Understand what this means?

240
00:26:29,994 --> 00:26:32,628
That you guys
don't take any shit?

241
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:36,650
Yes, something like this.

242
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:42,616
We go now.

243
00:27:16,998 --> 00:27:20,350
To the north there are many caves,
we'll travel through them.

244
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:22,919
It'll be safer. We go.

245
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:30,087
This cave leads us to the
"Valley the Five Lions".

246
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,175
In ancient days, the Afghan
King was asked to send...

247
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,713
...500 of his warriors
into battle.

248
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:37,464
He sent only five.

249
00:27:40,189 --> 00:27:42,977
His greatest five,
and they won.

250
00:27:43,443 --> 00:27:47,032
He said, "It's better to send
five lions than 500 sheep."

251
00:27:47,074 --> 00:27:49,746
What do you think of this?
I think the King was lucky.

252
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:51,264
Lucky?

253
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:56,027
How much longer to the village?
About two hours.

254
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:11,037
Where in my sector are
the missiles being delivered?

255
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,987
I don't know.

256
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,545
You're a liar.

257
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:22,778
Where?

258
00:28:26,068 --> 00:28:27,594
Where?

259
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:30,137
All right, I'll tell you.

260
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,758
I knew you were lying.

261
00:28:34,787 --> 00:28:39,064
Now, where are
the missiles located?

262
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:41,657
Close.

263
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:43,930
How close?

264
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:47,785
In your ass!

265
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:03,384
You've tried
my patience long enough.

266
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:13,137
I tried to be civilized.

267
00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:46,456
The name John Rambo...

268
00:29:51,344 --> 00:29:53,224
...do you know it?

269
00:29:55,013 --> 00:29:56,470
No?

270
00:29:57,245 --> 00:30:00,487
He says there are plans
for a rescue attempt...

271
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,562
...with the help of
some of the rebels.

272
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,355
He also says he knows
where this man is going.

273
00:30:10,612 --> 00:30:12,315
We will welcome him.

274
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,766
It's the last village in the valley.
About 100 men here.

275
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,487
They have a lot of kids here.
Yeah.

276
00:30:39,354 --> 00:30:41,231
And they are
good fighters too.

277
00:30:41,436 --> 00:30:44,105
I'll tell the leaders
we want to talk.

278
00:30:49,657 --> 00:30:52,003
They never see man
look like you.

279
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,644
These are Mujahideen horsemen.

280
00:31:01,646 --> 00:31:04,724
There are 10,000 horsemen
more waiting at the border.

281
00:31:04,764 --> 00:31:06,955
They are waiting to get weapons.
When they'll get it,

282
00:31:06,957 --> 00:31:08,717
they come back here to fight.

283
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:29,017
Let's go to the hospital.

284
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:37,119
He's the only doctor
for 500 kilometers.

285
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,067
The first medicine
they get in two months.

286
00:31:52,173 --> 00:31:55,957
More gifts from the Soviets.
They look like toys, but they're mines.

287
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:59,394
We teach the children not to touch.
Some learn too late.

288
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,469
Who's that?

289
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:07,399
His name is Uri.
He's Russian.

290
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:08,578
Deserter?

291
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:11,813
He calls himself a defector.
There are many like him.

292
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:16,025
He's the one who can help the most.
He knows the inside of the fort.

293
00:32:19,945 --> 00:32:21,551
I think we should go now.

294
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:47,390
Mine starts here at 1 meter like
this, then go 2 meter like this,

295
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,052
and like this.

296
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:52,191
There have four towers,
four guards,

297
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:55,684
here, here, here and here.

298
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,691
Where do they keep
the prisoners?

299
00:32:57,981 --> 00:32:59,355
Here.

300
00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:03,317
If we get in there,
is there another way out?

301
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:06,750
Underground,
where is all the bad water.

302
00:33:06,797 --> 00:33:09,571
I do not know words
for this place.

303
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,340
He means sewer.
Where is it?

304
00:33:12,342 --> 00:33:17,098
Here. Outside, it goes there.
Guards patrols there.

305
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:19,498
I do not think
you go this way.

306
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:22,777
Now, we should go through the
mine fields. They'll never expect it.

307
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:26,692
This can not be done. In there
are many Spetsnaz commandos.

308
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:31,040
We are only this.
We have lost many men.

309
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,391
We lose more men
if we go there.

310
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:35,907
I don't need many men.

311
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:38,155
What is it you want to do?

312
00:33:38,594 --> 00:33:40,871
I need two men to get me
through the mine field,

313
00:33:40,873 --> 00:33:42,255
and two to help
with the escape.

314
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:46,254
If this is done, Soviet will
come here like before,

315
00:33:46,296 --> 00:33:47,979
and more people will die.

316
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:50,095
I can't wait.

317
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,883
You must wait for help
the way we wait!

318
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:58,011
Then I'll go alone.
And you will die.

319
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:02,320
Then I die.

320
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,983
Wait!

321
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:11,819
Please don't go.

322
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,792
My name is Masoud.

323
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:24,044
You must not judge us...

324
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:27,252
...before you understand
why we are not ready to help.

325
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:32,010
Most of the Afghan
people are very strong,

326
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:35,339
and we are determined not
to be driven from our land.

327
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:41,677
Our children die of disease,
mines, and poison gas,

328
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:44,640
and the women
are raped and killed.

329
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:49,614
Last year, in the valley
of Laghman, the next valley,

330
00:34:49,782 --> 00:34:52,066
6,000 Afghans were killed.

331
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,612
Pregnant women
were cut with bayonets,

332
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:59,902
and their babies
thrown into the fires.

333
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:04,879
This is done, so they will not have
to fight the next generation of Afghans.

334
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,790
Yet nobody sees anything or
reads anything in the papers.

335
00:35:10,134 --> 00:35:11,629
What you see here...

336
00:35:13,137 --> 00:35:15,264
...are the Mujahideen soldiers,

337
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,427
holy warriors.

338
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:20,310
To us, this war is a holy war.

339
00:35:20,812 --> 00:35:23,309
And there is no true
death for a Mujahideen,

340
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,806
because we have
taken our last rites,

341
00:35:26,276 --> 00:35:29,147
and we consider ourselves
dead already.

342
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:33,987
To us, death for our land
and God is an honor.

343
00:35:34,117 --> 00:35:35,860
So, my friend,

344
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:41,957
what we must do is to stop this
killing of our women and children.

345
00:35:43,336 --> 00:35:45,368
If getting this man free,

346
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:51,255
so he can return to the free world
and tell what happens here, is necessary...

347
00:35:52,072 --> 00:35:54,228
...then of course we will help.

348
00:35:56,265 --> 00:36:01,217
Leave us now, so we may
speak among ourselves...

349
00:36:01,354 --> 00:36:04,021
...and find the best way
to free this man.

350
00:36:09,611 --> 00:36:12,323
Thank you.
We thank you.

351
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:39,425
Don't worry,
they will decide soon.

352
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:42,287
Got to get in there tonight.
What is your name?

353
00:36:45,981 --> 00:36:48,464
This boy is very hard inside.

354
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:50,741
His parents were
killed last year.

355
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:54,532
His brother died in the fort
where the American is.

356
00:36:54,991 --> 00:36:58,034
He looks like a boy,
but he fights like a man.

357
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,074
What is your name?
Rambo.

358
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:04,447
Where are you from?
Arizona.

359
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:06,996
Arizona?
How much days walk?

360
00:37:07,944 --> 00:37:10,590
About two years.
Two years.

361
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:15,103
Are you a soldier?
No more.

362
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:17,587
I am a soldier.
Yeah?

363
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:19,063
Are you here to fight?

364
00:37:19,432 --> 00:37:22,015
No.
Are you scared?

365
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:26,305
What is this?

366
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:28,886
It's a knife.
Can I see this?

367
00:37:28,888 --> 00:37:30,189
Sure.

368
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:41,125
Very good. Can I have it?
No.

369
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:45,618
What is this?
You want everything!

370
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,499
This is for luck.
What is luck?

371
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:50,357
Luck is...

372
00:37:52,224 --> 00:37:54,660
Can I have it?
I need luck.

373
00:37:54,702 --> 00:37:55,844
So do I.

374
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:02,976
Look what a child.
Always like this.

375
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:08,842
Look there!
It's our national sport.

376
00:38:08,991 --> 00:38:12,307
Old insane game,
maybe 3,000 years old.

377
00:38:12,745 --> 00:38:14,522
No, they never
stop playing it.

378
00:38:18,126 --> 00:38:20,407
War, not war,
they don't mind.

379
00:38:21,214 --> 00:38:23,965
You like it?
I'll take football.

380
00:38:24,424 --> 00:38:27,777
Football? What's football?
You play it with your foot?

381
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:29,413
Not really.

382
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:41,760
Come on, let's go.

383
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,555
Hey, American!

384
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:56,324
What are they saying?
They want you to try.

385
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:00,653
It's a way to welcome you to be with them.
If you want to try, go ahead, but...

386
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:03,353
...I'm not responsible for it.

387
00:39:07,593 --> 00:39:09,736
I'll try. Yes?

388
00:39:11,638 --> 00:39:13,115
What are the rules?

389
00:39:13,157 --> 00:39:15,256
Well, you have
to take the sheep...

390
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:18,430
...once around, and then
thrown it in the circle.

391
00:39:18,884 --> 00:39:19,960
Why?

392
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,965
Because there is a circle there.

393
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:26,342
That's it?
That's it. Very simple.

394
00:39:28,562 --> 00:39:30,121
Like football.

395
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:32,411
God must love crazy people!

396
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:35,608
Why? He makes
so many of them.

397
00:44:16,485 --> 00:44:18,008
Take cover!

398
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,195
Move! Move!

399
00:47:14,346 --> 00:47:16,353
Now you see how it is here.

400
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,937
Somewhere in war,
there's supposed to be honor.

401
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,945
Where is the honor here?
Where?

402
00:47:26,399 --> 00:47:29,539
We are taking the survivors to
the border. Are you coming?

403
00:47:30,987 --> 00:47:32,580
I'm going to the fort.

404
00:47:32,738 --> 00:47:35,093
Have you not seen
enough death?

405
00:47:35,671 --> 00:47:40,405
Go. Go while you can.
This is not your war.

406
00:47:43,457 --> 00:47:45,097
It is now.

407
00:47:48,922 --> 00:47:50,630
So be it.

408
00:47:52,217 --> 00:47:53,545
You are a good friend.

409
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,867
I stay. I will
show you the way.

410
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:08,732
I will go too.

411
00:48:09,483 --> 00:48:11,041
No, you go with them.

412
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:15,627
I will not. They killed all
my family. I want to fight.

413
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,789
Not with me. You go.

414
00:48:20,371 --> 00:48:21,920
Go on.

415
00:48:26,752 --> 00:48:28,543
Why must you do this?

416
00:48:30,215 --> 00:48:32,377
Because he'd do it for me.

417
00:48:58,253 --> 00:49:00,554
Have you decided to talk?

418
00:49:01,129 --> 00:49:02,620
No?

419
00:49:03,382 --> 00:49:05,049
Very well.

420
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:08,650
Soon you will be my
guest down the hall.

421
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:02,685
Come on.

422
00:50:41,949 --> 00:50:43,655
Go back!
No.

423
00:50:43,701 --> 00:50:44,732
Go back.

424
00:51:13,344 --> 00:51:14,625
Come on!

425
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:18,436
Stay here! Stay back!

426
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:20,182
I know this place.
You need me.

427
00:51:20,224 --> 00:51:23,010
I don't need you dead.
Now go back. You understand?

428
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,056
Let's go, sir.

429
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:56,967
Come on!

430
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:27,062
American?

431
00:58:28,659 --> 00:58:29,904
American?

432
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,464
Colonel? Colonel?

433
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,101
John? How the hell
did you get in here?

434
00:59:03,143 --> 00:59:05,903
Can you move?
You damn right I can.

435
00:59:07,895 --> 00:59:09,094
Let's go!

436
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:15,455
John, behind you!

437
00:59:26,157 --> 00:59:27,410
Go!

438
00:59:33,165 --> 00:59:35,917
John, get out of here.
Get the hell outta here!

439
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:35,754
Go on!

440
01:01:32,515 --> 01:01:33,914
Over here!

441
01:01:35,157 --> 01:01:36,375
Come on!

442
01:01:43,001 --> 01:01:44,251
Help me!

443
01:02:19,287 --> 01:02:20,652
Take him!

444
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:43,626
Go on!
Hurry!

445
01:02:47,481 --> 01:02:48,777
Give me the boy!

446
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,588
Come on!

447
01:03:22,183 --> 01:03:24,098
Come on!
Okay!

448
01:03:25,186 --> 01:03:26,350
Take the kid.

449
01:03:29,691 --> 01:03:30,890
Get down!

450
01:04:44,392 --> 01:04:45,855
Give me the boy!

451
01:05:41,198 --> 01:05:45,243
Who is this terrorist? What
makes you so valuable to him?

452
01:05:45,702 --> 01:05:49,836
This bastard tried to destroy
me tonight, but he failed.

453
01:05:49,878 --> 01:05:53,952
At sunrise, I will hunt him down,
and have his skin hanging on the wall!

454
01:05:54,337 --> 01:05:57,041
You don't have to hunt
him. What?

455
01:05:58,008 --> 01:05:59,635
He'll find you.

456
01:06:02,803 --> 01:06:04,708
Are you insane?

457
01:06:05,516 --> 01:06:08,600
One man against
trained commandos?

458
01:06:09,061 --> 01:06:10,930
Who do you think this man is?

459
01:06:11,877 --> 01:06:13,328
God?

460
01:06:14,649 --> 01:06:18,265
No, God would have mercy.
He won't.

461
01:06:32,126 --> 01:06:34,272
It's all right.
There's nobody there.

462
01:06:34,378 --> 01:06:37,051
All right.
This will hold a while.

463
01:06:38,044 --> 01:06:39,886
What's the fastest
way outta here?

464
01:06:40,195 --> 01:06:43,369
Northwest, there's trail
between mountains,

465
01:06:43,411 --> 01:06:47,343
about 3 kilometers from here.
The trail is very difficult.

466
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:51,839
Now, you take the boy
and go. I want to stay.

467
01:06:52,353 --> 01:06:53,729
You can't.

468
01:06:55,607 --> 01:06:59,137
You cannot go back there.
We must all go to Pakistan.

469
01:06:59,445 --> 01:07:00,858
No, I gotta go back.

470
01:07:00,903 --> 01:07:04,027
I know he's your friend,
but you cannot do this!

471
01:07:04,355 --> 01:07:07,112
You both will die.
For what? Come with us!

472
01:07:07,154 --> 01:07:08,458
Just do what I say.

473
01:07:10,585 --> 01:07:11,789
Give me your gun.

474
01:07:18,385 --> 01:07:21,375
All right, let's go.
Come on!

475
01:07:38,406 --> 01:07:40,236
I see you again?

476
01:07:41,242 --> 01:07:42,697
Sure.

477
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:31,786
Come on! Move! Move!

478
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,794
Come on!

479
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,777
Can you fly that thing?

480
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:55,495
Let's find out.

481
01:14:19,602 --> 01:14:20,971
Let's go!

482
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,105
Hurry! Hurry!
Get on board!

483
01:14:48,646 --> 01:14:49,867
Hold on!

484
01:14:59,851 --> 01:15:01,163
Over there!

485
01:15:07,192 --> 01:15:08,345
There!

486
01:15:27,462 --> 01:15:28,749
Hold on!

487
01:15:29,506 --> 01:15:30,835
Get him up!

488
01:15:31,301 --> 01:15:32,825
Take my hand!

489
01:15:57,785 --> 01:15:59,309
We're going down!

490
01:16:14,344 --> 01:16:15,547
Hold on!

491
01:16:28,392 --> 01:16:30,226
Get out of here. Quick!
Come on, move it!

492
01:16:30,665 --> 01:16:31,810
It's gonna blow up.

493
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,443
Take what you can, John!

494
01:16:33,904 --> 01:16:36,113
Come on, move it!
Come on!

495
01:16:49,003 --> 01:16:51,566
We gotta get to the border.
We'll stay here.

496
01:16:51,631 --> 01:16:53,194
We know where to go.

497
01:16:53,549 --> 01:16:56,538
Which direction, John?
Northeast.

498
01:17:44,643 --> 01:17:46,256
Hold it, John!

499
01:17:49,481 --> 01:17:51,093
I gotta rest a minute.

500
01:17:53,318 --> 01:17:54,496
How's the wound?

501
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,638
You taught us to
ignore pain, didn't ya?

502
01:17:57,866 --> 01:17:59,348
Has it worked?

503
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,757
Not really.

504
01:18:03,077 --> 01:18:04,688
Don't take it personally.

505
01:18:06,414 --> 01:18:07,741
Thanks.

506
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:30,716
You go on ahead and see
if you can find some cover.

507
01:19:06,712 --> 01:19:07,740
No!

508
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:17,726
John!

509
01:19:33,037 --> 01:19:34,289
John!

510
01:19:43,013 --> 01:19:45,422
That was close, John!
How are you?

511
01:19:46,307 --> 01:19:47,924
Well done!

512
01:19:59,154 --> 01:20:02,101
We don't want to make it easy for
them. We'd better split up.

513
01:20:03,533 --> 01:20:05,598
I'm sorry I got
you into this, John!

514
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,518
No, you're not.

515
01:21:08,348 --> 01:21:09,696
Are you listening?

516
01:21:10,611 --> 01:21:11,938
Who are you?

517
01:21:13,104 --> 01:21:15,310
Your worst nightmare.

518
01:23:09,305 --> 01:23:10,520
That's good timing.

519
01:23:10,907 --> 01:23:12,413
What are friends for?

520
01:23:14,082 --> 01:23:15,155
You get back to the hole.

521
01:23:15,385 --> 01:23:17,300
I'll cover you and see
if there's anyone left.

522
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:19,203
John!

523
01:26:34,262 --> 01:26:36,453
Across the valley is the border.

524
01:26:38,474 --> 01:26:41,298
We did it, John.
Yeah.

525
01:26:42,269 --> 01:26:43,550
Wait!

526
01:26:47,401 --> 01:26:48,927
What the hell is that?

527
01:26:52,904 --> 01:26:54,364
The son of a bitch!

528
01:27:20,307 --> 01:27:22,716
Do not try to retreat!

529
01:27:23,268 --> 01:27:24,959
You can not escape!

530
01:27:25,104 --> 01:27:27,799
We will not attack
if you do not run.

531
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:29,848
We do not want to hurt you.

532
01:27:30,047 --> 01:27:31,325
Somehow I don't believe him.

533
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:36,278
I order you to come forward
and you will be given a fair trial.

534
01:27:36,512 --> 01:27:39,069
Drop your weapons and
remain where you are.

535
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,015
You got any ideas?

536
01:27:42,393 --> 01:27:44,235
Drop your weapons!

537
01:27:45,437 --> 01:27:47,229
Surrounding them is out.

538
01:27:48,649 --> 01:27:50,906
Helluva time for humor, John!

539
01:27:51,903 --> 01:27:54,311
Drop the weapons!
Now!

540
01:27:55,824 --> 01:27:57,971
You have no chance
of escape.

541
01:27:58,013 --> 01:28:01,781
Come forward!
I wish to take you back alive.

542
01:28:02,204 --> 01:28:04,412
This is your last warning.

543
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:09,175
The choice is yours.

544
01:28:09,642 --> 01:28:11,037
What do you say, John?

545
01:28:13,257 --> 01:28:14,544
Fuck 'em!

546
01:28:33,447 --> 01:28:36,019
If we're gonna go, I wish we could
have taken that bastard with us!

547
01:29:14,153 --> 01:29:15,268
What is that?

548
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:26,711
It's the rebels.

549
01:29:39,471 --> 01:29:40,516
Come on!

550
01:33:25,324 --> 01:33:26,660
John, get out of there!

551
01:33:34,769 --> 01:33:35,809
John!

552
01:35:02,171 --> 01:35:05,921
You sure you don't want to stay?
You fight good for a tourist.

553
01:35:08,762 --> 01:35:10,169
Maybe next time.

554
01:35:11,556 --> 01:35:13,182
You want this back?

555
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:16,930
No. You keep it.

556
01:35:17,561 --> 01:35:19,100
Can you not stay?

557
01:35:33,079 --> 01:35:34,490
I've got to go.

558
01:35:59,188 --> 01:36:01,021
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

559
01:36:08,863 --> 01:36:10,394
Hard to believe, John.

560
01:36:10,758 --> 01:36:12,058
What's that, sir?

561
01:36:12,422 --> 01:36:13,446
Well, I hate to admit it,

562
01:36:13,448 --> 01:36:15,908
but the truth is I think
we're getting soft.

563
01:36:17,831 --> 01:36:19,707
Maybe just a little, sir.

564
01:36:20,181 --> 01:36:21,940
Just a little.

565
01:36:21,964 --> 01:36:26,164
