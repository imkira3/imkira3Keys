1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:32,439
Teela, my child.

3
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:36,739
You must take this stone to
the Paladin at Sung Hill.

4
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:39,561
I am too old to make the journey.

5
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:42,057
Run! Run!

6
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:56,829
Teela! Teela!

7
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:16,085
Where... is the stone?

8
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:18,057
You will never find it!

9
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,944
Run, Teela! The Goddess will not let me die.

10
00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:22,437
Find help.

11
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:36,325
We shouldn't doing this.

12
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:39,325
Nonsense.

13
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:59,517
Gentle... or we'll go... pooh!

14
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:12,417
- This-this one here?
- Mm-hm.

15
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,008
- OK.
- Softly!

16
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,701
- I can't!
- Pour.

17
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,875
- Nothing's happening. We should stop.
- Ah-ah... and I would pour the rest in.

18
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,067
Oh!

19
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:37,717
Now, begin!

20
00:04:38,717 --> 00:04:40,205
Ah, that's it.

21
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:14,745
I don't know what went wrong.

22
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:17,654
I think I need more Basilisk blood.

23
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:18,982
No!

24
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,177
What's that smell?!

25
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,167
Take care of this.

26
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:25,256
You brought some down there, boy?

27
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:27,445
I'll strip your hide from you!

28
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:40,334
Out of my way, gimp!

29
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:42,485
You clumsy bitch!

30
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,405
You're not worth the gruel it costs to feed you!

31
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:48,976
Leave that! Let the gimp finish it.

32
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:51,475
Here!

33
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,530
Take this into town.

34
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,455
Get coin, from the wizard

35
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,440
And I want you back before first watch!

36
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:00,725
I don't want any trouble with the guards.

37
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:15,914
- I'll go.
- No, your leg...

38
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:19,915
You won't get back before dark. They'll catch
you and... they'll brand you as a runaway.

39
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:22,868
I mastered the vision spell you gave me.

40
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:27,330
Although, I-I think it could've...
used some more Basilisk blood.

41
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:30,935
And what the Basilisk blood project?

42
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:34,204
An eagle.

43
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:38,015
That's fascinating. I'm certain Basilisk
blood would result in a fireball.

44
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:45,944
Think I'm ready for more spells.

45
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:47,855
Really? What kind of spells?

46
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:51,635
Healing.

47
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,374
I'm not a holy man.

48
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,124
You need a healer.

49
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,125
Magic... is not an art of
faith, but of understanding.

50
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:11,325
However... I do have something for you.

51
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,425
Bring me that pile of parchment.

52
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:25,554
There, a displacement spell.

53
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,914
It's very useful, but don't
use it on living objects.

54
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:30,564
Why not?

55
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,785
Because it will most likely cease to be living.

56
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:34,560
What are you doing?

57
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:38,354
I'm leaving. These things
not safe to be left here.

58
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:41,194
Nothing, is safe here anymore.

59
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:43,554
You're leaving?

60
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:47,555
There's too many eyes, too much... lust for power.
I've stayed too long.

61
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,974
Take me with you.

62
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:53,284
You've a strong mind Marek...
and a gift for learning.

63
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:54,804
You could teach me.

64
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:56,944
You could buy me and you could teach me.

65
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:00,984
There's an inn...

66
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:03,035
It's just outside of town.

67
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,621
You ask for Hammerhead.

68
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:09,915
You'll find the experience that you lack, there

69
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,750
and someone... will be in need of a conjurer.

70
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:17,215
I can't.

71
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:22,620
I'd be alone... a runaway.

72
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:25,114
Hunted down and hanged.

73
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:29,194
You're a fighter, Marek.

74
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,494
It would be a shame to see that flame go out.

75
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:35,495
- But, I ca...
- No. It's getting dark and you must go.

76
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:38,155
It's almost night.

77
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:42,884
Here, it's for the hogs' room.

78
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:44,654
Please don't go.

79
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:46,784
You're my only friend.

80
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,759
The only one who could help me.

81
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:54,484
Good friends aren't so hard to find.

82
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:57,315
Our paths will cross again.

83
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,180
Now... haste.

84
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:06,215
It's after first watch and the guards
will looking for slaves breaking curfew.

85
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,859
- What is it?
- Adventurers, they have dragon heads.

86
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:38,033
The first watch!

87
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:54,955
Watch where you're going, gimp!

88
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:58,404
Ohh... ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

89
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,425
What do we think of this, huh?

90
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Oh, slave girl, huh? But you're not so young.

91
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:13,230
I could sell you as a 15 year old. Mmm...

92
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:15,725
- 16 years old, no right leg?
- No! No!

93
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:18,754
But it's your twisted foot... it's not my type.

94
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:22,755
But some man, mmm, some man
may pay extra for a girl like you.

95
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,095
No!

96
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,505
Take her to the den. Take her!

97
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,874
No! No.

98
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,875
- Let go! Let go! Let go!
- Ohh!

99
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:39,564
And find out who owns the rights, in case...
somebody wants to claim her.

100
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,630
Hold!

101
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:53,137
My slave, she ran away... but I caught her.

102
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:55,530
No! He's lying!

103
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,130
Your slave's out past first watch.
She'll have to come with me.

104
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:04,768
Like, I said... my slave girl ran away...

105
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:07,175
and I found her.

106
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,470
There's no harm done here.

107
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,615
That's for your troubles.

108
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:21,515
What's her name?

109
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:30,541
Kill him!

110
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,385
Ah, you... bitch!

111
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:13,318
I will find you!

112
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:24,975
You, uh... you just don't know who I am, do you?

113
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,205
I have a general idea.

114
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:36,235
If you cross me, you will pay!

115
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:37,423
You thrust this in with some force, my lady.

116
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,459
The effect... was nearly disastrous.

117
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,369
Papers!

118
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:47,385
- What are you carrying?
- Nae but straw.

119
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,685
Move along. Move along.

120
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:07,996
Get off me!

121
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,476
A thousand pardons, my lady.

122
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:11,908
I can't help myself.

123
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:15,943
Beautiful girl... intimate moment in the straw...

124
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:20,470
But, alas, work calls.

125
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:23,339
The magistrate isn't going to
cuckhold himself, now, is he?

126
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:24,993
Pleasant travels.

127
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:34,695
<i>- The coins...
- Hey, stop! You there, stop!</i>

128
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,690
<i>Hey!</i>

129
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,195
Oh, no! No! No!

130
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:26,490
Who's the man here?

131
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:32,065
Does this belong to you?

132
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,065
Yes.

133
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,955
I trust this can be forgotten!

134
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:56,588
You led the Vitalian Guard to this house?!

135
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:58,604
Where's my coin?

136
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:01,054
I'm sorry, I was robbed, and...

137
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:06,544
Are you trying to make a fool of me, girl?

138
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,895
You managed that, yourself.

139
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,404
You're finished here!

140
00:17:15,405 --> 00:17:19,390
Yes, I wanted you clean, so I
could keep your price up!

141
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:23,425
Now, I'll just take what's mine! Sell
whatever's left of you... to the whorehouse!

142
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:10,384
What was that?

143
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:15,985
- I... I don't mean...
- You used no powders and you said no words.

144
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:19,746
It-it was like no magic I've ever seen before.

145
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:24,046
<i>- Where is she?
- Witch! Conjurer!</i>

146
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:29,578
I have to go. I'm going to Hammerhead's inn.

147
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:33,391
Come with me. I can't do it alone, Egan.

148
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:34,791
Wait.

149
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:44,267
I made it. It'll help you run.

150
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:48,985
I don't have your courage.
I- I would never make it.

151
00:19:51,385 --> 00:19:53,205
Come on, go. Quick.

152
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:58,308
Goodbye, Egan.

153
00:19:58,309 --> 00:19:59,509
Go.

154
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:15,143
Make sure she stays out.

155
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,060
I won't be sayin' it again!

156
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:41,605
No fightin' blades in the establishment!

157
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:52,084
Feed that mess to the pigs.

158
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:24,655
A round of drinks for the Blood Clan!
On the house!

159
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:34,664
Hammerhead!

160
00:24:34,665 --> 00:24:36,739
Move it along, nowl!

161
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,240
Hammerhead!

162
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:43,540
I'm going to assume that you're new here

163
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:47,300
and that this is a gift... so that Orc over there

164
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:50,695
doesn't have to polish the blood
off the blade of my ax, again.

165
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,730
- I'm looking for work.
- Then talk to Narnie, over there.

166
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:57,240
No... adventuring work!

167
00:24:57,275 --> 00:25:00,394
I want a chance at a bounty. I do magic.

168
00:25:00,395 --> 00:25:01,574
Ohhh!

169
00:25:01,595 --> 00:25:04,725
Why didn't you say so? A magician!

170
00:25:05,425 --> 00:25:08,120
Well! I had no idea!

171
00:25:08,155 --> 00:25:12,155
And all this time I've been payin'
court to a real fyekin' magician!

172
00:25:13,768 --> 00:25:16,849
- Now get out before my temper's...
- Ahh!

173
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:24,122
In the name of the goddess, Anisette,
I demand audience with Orin Tuck!

174
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:34,375
- Fyekin' women tonight!
- You are Orin Tuck?

175
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:37,915
Hammerhead's what they be callin' me now.

176
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:41,925
I am Teela, of the order of
Anisette, sent to plead your help.

177
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:44,810
Orcs raided my temple, two nights past

178
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:48,535
and my people were slain, or taken by foul beasts.

179
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,064
I seek heroes to win their freedom.

180
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:53,044
Have you any gold?

181
00:25:54,445 --> 00:25:58,445
I... have some. 200 silver.

182
00:25:58,915 --> 00:26:01,154
That's not gold.

183
00:26:01,155 --> 00:26:05,155
Please, you and your kind were friends
to the order, in times of old.

184
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:08,759
Times of old are olden times, now.

185
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,015
And those heroes lie shriveled, in the dirt.

186
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,364
I've no use for causes!

187
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,479
And neither does any man here, today.

188
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,588
They have my sister!

189
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:21,589
Does any lad here want to
help save this lass's sister,

190
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,914
who was kidnapped by a band or marauding Orcs?

191
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:29,915
The pay is 200 silver pieces.

192
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:39,134
There's the door.

193
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:40,975
I suggest you use it.

194
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:54,345
If I just fyekin' saw who I think I fyekin' saw...

195
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:57,644
she better be here to sell herself as a whore!

196
00:26:58,645 --> 00:27:00,485
I will take that bounty!

197
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,770
I'm forming a team.

198
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:10,754
Any of you are welcome to join my team.

199
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:14,135
I... bring the skill... of magic.

200
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:20,738
<i>Careful, she has magic!</i>

201
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,654
Wait!

202
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:30,064
You need help.

203
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:33,484
In there... I-I heard you. You nee...
you need help.

204
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,485
I require seasoned adventurers... heroes, even.
Not young girls.

205
00:27:39,755 --> 00:27:41,355
I have a team!

206
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:44,915
You have a limp.

207
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:47,924
No one else will help you.

208
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:49,514
Hammerhead said it.

209
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:53,515
The mission is too dangerous and...
you have too little to pay.

210
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:58,555
And you... you do not fear it?

211
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:01,894
No.

212
00:28:02,095 --> 00:28:04,935
- Should I?
- Yes.

213
00:28:19,295 --> 00:28:23,295
200 silver pieces... full sum upon completion.

214
00:28:24,815 --> 00:28:26,804
It will be dangerous.

215
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,004
But with a care, a man just might survive it.

216
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:31,658
You won't regret it.

217
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:35,144
- I very much doubt that.
- Give me until fourth watch.

218
00:28:35,145 --> 00:28:37,725
We meet at the stone circle, at dawn.

219
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:12,941
I know you.

220
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:16,498
You're that slave girl that
got me thrown into this cage.

221
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:17,899
Marek.

222
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:24,764
That pimp has some influential
friends in my regiment.

223
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,414
I'm here to free you.

224
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:30,405
All I need is for you to swear an oath to me.

225
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,265
Why not?

226
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:36,778
I need a swordsman, for a bounty.

227
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,105
Join me and we'll win it together.

228
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:42,395
You're joking!

229
00:29:43,935 --> 00:29:45,743
You're not joking.

230
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:53,994
Long ago, I swore an oath, to the Vitalian Empire.

231
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:57,995
That oath, took me across the
world, and into this cage.

232
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,014
I'm done with oaths.

233
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:04,314
I saw you in the alley. You... you're a brave man.

234
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:07,364
- I wouldn't go that far.
- No more masters, no magistrates!

235
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:09,474
We-we'll create our own destinies.

236
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:14,994
And what would those destinies
hold for us, little varmint?

237
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:18,515
A life with dignity.

238
00:30:21,355 --> 00:30:24,935
Well, friend... for a life of dignity...

239
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:41,625
Oh, God.

240
00:30:53,205 --> 00:30:56,674
Oh, here come the guards! Maybe
one of them has the key!

241
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,374
Reckless balls...!

242
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:43,075
Name's Thane.

243
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:47,914
We need a thief.

244
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:49,270
It's Thor's day.

245
00:31:50,271 --> 00:31:53,531
I believe there's one coupling
with my commander's wife.

246
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,289
Well, there's our thief.

247
00:32:01,314 --> 00:32:02,514
Pssst!

248
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:04,344
Boy!

249
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:05,966
Boy!

250
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:07,767
Boy!

251
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,644
Go around the corner and tell the guards

252
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:16,065
you saw a man climb into that window.

253
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,526
What's on your leg?

254
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:23,527
Go!

255
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:29,548
What is that on your leg?

256
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:30,735
Oh! My husband's back!

257
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:34,426
<i>Take these! Go! Go! Go! No-no-no! Don't hurt me!</i>

258
00:32:53,683 --> 00:32:56,294
What is that thing on your foot?

259
00:32:56,295 --> 00:32:57,504
Where's my money?

260
00:32:57,505 --> 00:33:00,934
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- In the hay wagon.

261
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,469
I meet a lot of women in the hay.

262
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,001
No offense, but, I... can't say
as I remember you, sweetheart!

263
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,758
Wait, it's coming to me.

264
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,857
What manner of insult is it you bring to me?!

265
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:14,804
To this house! To my bed! Get away, you whore!

266
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:17,064
Can we maybe discuss this somewhere else?

267
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:18,575
Take your time, pal.

268
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:22,005
Alright... alright.

269
00:33:22,006 --> 00:33:26,006
Given my very... limited... knowledge on thieves,

270
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,494
I would assume you money is gone. Gambled away,

271
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:32,933
or spent on very, very expensive women.

272
00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:34,684
You bastard!

273
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:36,374
Most probably.

274
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:47,224
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm
a harder catch than that.

275
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,234
We're here to make you an offer.

276
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:53,358
Guads! Guards! I can just...

277
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:55,074
I need you for one mission.

278
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,260
No chance, milady.

279
00:33:56,295 --> 00:33:59,454
Then we'll let the magistrate have
you, and she keeps her clothes.

280
00:33:59,555 --> 00:34:01,314
- What's the pay?
- 50 silver.

281
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,615
100!

282
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:08,134
- 100!
- Is now really the time to haggle?

283
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:10,114
- 75.
- What?

284
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,105
- Have him destroyed!
- I'm in!

285
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,035
We're here.

286
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:49,954
Weh-heh-heh-hell, well... allow me!

287
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,210
Dagen.

288
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:56,804
- And you are?
- Teela, from the order of Anisette.

289
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:58,323
A holy woman?!

290
00:35:01,575 --> 00:35:05,575
A little girl, a Vitalian... and a miscreant.

291
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:09,825
Pray the goddess may bless our worthy cause.

292
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,025
Charming.

293
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:15,644
There is an Orc encampment 10 leagues east.

294
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:17,174
My sister is held there.

295
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:19,144
We will rescue her under cover of night.

296
00:35:19,145 --> 00:35:23,145
You and I, under the covers, at night? I like it.

297
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:26,090
Except without the dress. All done up in...

298
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,825
why don't you stick out like a
lily in a pile of pig shite?

299
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,004
- Done. Up!
- Should we head out?

300
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:32,994
My white robes symbolize purity

301
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:35,404
and show my dedication to the goddess, Anisette.

302
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:39,200
And I will not be spoken to
like one of your common whores.

303
00:35:41,645 --> 00:35:44,444
Speak to ladies like whores, and whores, like

304
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:47,813
ladies. Surprising what you get from both.

305
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:51,474
I've ten leagues, yet, before I test this blade.

306
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:53,055
Don't push me off.

307
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:00,095
The goddess leads us.

308
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,275
<i>"The goddess leads us. "</i>

309
00:36:06,275 --> 00:36:08,240
Ten leagues.

310
00:37:22,345 --> 00:37:24,724
Maybe we should take a look around, down there.

311
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:27,619
See if they... missed anything valuable.

312
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,705
They are my friends and teachers.

313
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:35,924
Should we go down there... to pick up the trail?

314
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,495
Let's keep moving.

315
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:02,019
What is that smell?

316
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:06,275
We're to stay downwind.

317
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,959
Keep low... and quiet.

318
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:14,087
That's a lot of orcs.

319
00:38:14,122 --> 00:38:16,444
Right. Time to go home.

320
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:18,807
If we fight, we die.

321
00:38:19,408 --> 00:38:20,979
I have a plan.

322
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:24,355
I'll create a distraction.

323
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:27,364
The meadow. Draw them out that way.
Get them to chase us.

324
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:31,365
- Then Dagen will run in and...
- Oh, hey, no! Like hell I will!

325
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,124
You out of your nut?

326
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:34,790
Those aren't imaginary Orcs that your

327
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:37,805
grandmother told you about, to
lull you to sleep, sweetheart.

328
00:38:37,806 --> 00:38:41,806
Those are real, bloodthirsty, musclebound animals.

329
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:46,388
And we only have one musclebound animal.

330
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:48,956
I can conjure a distraction.

331
00:38:48,957 --> 00:38:50,931
There's a lot of Orcs down there.

332
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:57,532
Fine! Well, then, thief, you're going to slip
into the water, quietly... hop into those cages

333
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:01,915
and find out which one has Teela's sister in it.

334
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,740
- Mmm.
- Then come ashore when you're in the clear.

335
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:06,934
- Well, what about freeing the other captives?
- Yeah, why not?

336
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:09,109
And while I'm at it, I'll swipe some teeth

337
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,339
from the biggest gooch's mouth.

338
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,907
- Forget it!
- If anything happens, we'll attack...

339
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:16,809
causing a distraction.

340
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,964
It's a good plan.

341
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:20,794
Naturally!

342
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:23,894
And what about that guard,
down there by the cages?

343
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,894
Maybe I'll make friends with him.

344
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:29,814
All the while, Thane can spend the night, up
here, on the rocks, pleasuring you lovely ladies,

345
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:33,674
while Teela's sex deprived
goddess watches on, with envy.

346
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:36,809
Shove your dagger straight up through his bowels.

347
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,005
He won't scream and death is instant.

348
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:44,656
The sisters of my order
study principles of combat.

349
00:39:44,657 --> 00:39:47,864
- Dagen, if your thieving skills aren't up to it.
- My thieving skills?

350
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:51,484
No-no-no-no-no. It's fine. I'll do it.

351
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:55,485
Fyke! Always the thief gets
the sodden end of the stick!

352
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,915
Teela, cut that out!

353
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:00,645
Alright? It's bad luck.

354
00:40:06,145 --> 00:40:08,331
Alright, excuse me.

355
00:40:09,885 --> 00:40:11,954
What's she look like, this sister of yours?

356
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:14,294
- Brown hair.
- Is she beautiful?

357
00:40:15,173 --> 00:40:17,315
Chances are improving.

358
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:28,935
What's going on down there?

359
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:33,190
Teela, is that your sister?

360
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,105
No, a priest.

361
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:45,013
That's him. He led the raid on my temple.

362
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:51,455
- Where is the stone?
- I don't know.

363
00:40:58,227 --> 00:41:00,219
What is he doing to him?

364
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:09,397
Necromancy. It's an old, dark magic,

365
00:41:09,882 --> 00:41:12,170
which draws on the life of survivors.

366
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:14,914
I'd only ever heard tales of it, until now.

367
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:28,044
I can't see Dagen.

368
00:41:28,745 --> 00:41:30,156
Any sign of him?

369
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,657
Come on, thief, earn your pay.

370
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:52,644
Which one of you is Teela's sister, Caeryn?

371
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:54,279
They kill those of us who speak.

372
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:58,475
I mean to free you.

373
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:02,004
- The Ogre came and he took...
- Silence!

374
00:42:02,405 --> 00:42:05,514
Or my blade shall taste of your blood, again!

375
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:17,333
So, what have we got, here?

376
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:23,955
Put it in... easy, easy...

377
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:30,115
A bit deeper... and... there she is.

378
00:42:31,498 --> 00:42:34,515
Right. Let's have a look at you.

379
00:42:35,818 --> 00:42:37,631
You're Caeryn?

380
00:42:40,535 --> 00:42:41,743
Caeryn isn't here.

381
00:42:41,778 --> 00:42:44,884
- What do you mean?
- I misunderstood.

382
00:42:45,085 --> 00:42:47,646
Goddess wants all of her worshipers released.

383
00:42:48,946 --> 00:42:52,022
They'll see we've escaped and come after us.

384
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,344
Ohh... oh, no.

385
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:07,126
Fyke! Don't do it.

386
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,690
Alright. Alright. They've got him.

387
00:43:17,172 --> 00:43:19,956
No-no! Come on down whenever you're ready!

388
00:43:19,957 --> 00:43:21,351
It's going in!

389
00:43:27,112 --> 00:43:29,144
Do we have a plan?

390
00:43:29,145 --> 00:43:30,534
We fight.

391
00:43:30,535 --> 00:43:32,804
I thought you said we'd die.

392
00:43:32,805 --> 00:43:34,225
We'll see now, won't we?

393
00:43:58,575 --> 00:44:00,166
It is a lot of Orcs.

394
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,092
Are you alright?

395
00:44:29,093 --> 00:44:30,591
Of course I'm not alright!

396
00:44:47,778 --> 00:44:49,192
Help Teela!

397
00:45:07,658 --> 00:45:09,645
You had to fyeking stab me.

398
00:45:09,646 --> 00:45:12,220
Teela, your combat training is shite!

399
00:45:12,255 --> 00:45:14,795
Leave us your women and you can live.

400
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,755
How very Orkish of you.

401
00:45:37,755 --> 00:45:40,765
Leave me! I'm not afraid to die.

402
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:42,389
Just do it, already.

403
00:45:47,123 --> 00:45:49,313
You had to fyeking stab me.

404
00:45:58,145 --> 00:46:00,017
Must have lost them.

405
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:04,193
Not. Marek!

406
00:46:04,885 --> 00:46:07,657
Could really use some magic, right now!

407
00:46:08,657 --> 00:46:12,128
- Just leave me! I'm slowing you down!
- No!

408
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:14,113
Our oath goes both ways!

409
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:21,729
Move him faster, or drop him!

410
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:38,134
Wait, wait! I know this place!

411
00:46:38,135 --> 00:46:40,194
Up there, we raided a camp here, once.

412
00:46:40,195 --> 00:46:42,722
There's a cave. It's hard to get to.

413
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:49,370
I'm out of arrows!

414
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,690
Hard to get to?

415
00:47:06,915 --> 00:47:08,915
I'm not gonna let you die!

416
00:47:14,325 --> 00:47:16,557
The bolt! Pull the bolt!

417
00:47:16,592 --> 00:47:18,790
- I'm alright!
- OK.

418
00:47:20,855 --> 00:47:22,587
Keep him quiet!

419
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:24,933
Shhh! Quiet!

420
00:47:27,725 --> 00:47:29,945
I'm bleeding too fast!

421
00:47:31,045 --> 00:47:32,445
Move aside.

422
00:47:40,295 --> 00:47:43,871
Embrace the pain and welcome
death, should she beckon you.

423
00:47:48,919 --> 00:47:50,719
No! No!

424
00:48:25,431 --> 00:48:27,218
I couldn't get it all.

425
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:30,338
It'll take time to fully heal you.

426
00:48:30,339 --> 00:48:31,997
But you will live.

427
00:48:33,197 --> 00:48:35,024
You are so beautiful.

428
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:37,464
Sleep now. I will watch over you.

429
00:48:37,465 --> 00:48:38,743
Thank you.

430
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,315
Thank you.

431
00:48:54,115 --> 00:48:55,881
I'm going to see what else is in here.

432
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,860
It's Faltic.

433
00:50:40,475 --> 00:50:44,475
It needs to be placed on a shrine. It's a...
gift to the gods, to grant a wish for love.

434
00:50:47,983 --> 00:50:49,671
How do you know that?

435
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:52,973
Personal experience, I'm afraid.

436
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:59,916
It's far too pretty a thing for this place.

437
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,742
I don't even know where we are.
What is this, a house?

438
00:51:04,743 --> 00:51:06,112
Ah, no.

439
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:09,600
No, it's a-it's a runner's cache.

440
00:51:09,635 --> 00:51:12,989
Daring smugglers used to keep them
up and down the trade routes.

441
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,290
It's long forgotten.

442
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:19,325
But, um... might wish we asked to go
through them... being a slave in them.

443
00:51:23,945 --> 00:51:27,945
No, I ju... um, I just, uh... saw
the-the mark on your... neck.

444
00:51:31,165 --> 00:51:32,815
Explains a lot.

445
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,025
I'm going to make a fire.

446
00:52:08,915 --> 00:52:12,235
Well, Teela. I presume the mission's over?

447
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:17,935
Unless, of course, you have some idea as
to where your sister might actually be.

448
00:52:19,065 --> 00:52:21,699
My sister might have been taken by the Ogre.

449
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:25,701
- The Ogre?
- Oh, yes, THE Ogre. And not just any Ogre...

450
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:30,505
but the one that attacked
your temple, with the Orcs.

451
00:52:30,705 --> 00:52:34,705
A little-or should I say, a HUGE
detail that Teela left out.

452
00:52:35,474 --> 00:52:37,840
It's probably why she didn't want
us to go down there. We'd have

453
00:52:37,841 --> 00:52:40,794
- noticed all the evidence...
- No!

454
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:43,874
- I mean, I didn't know the goddess led us to...
- Oh, the goddess be damned!

455
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:47,464
I did my part, whether your
sister was there or not!

456
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:50,415
Now I want my silver and then, I'll be going.

457
00:52:51,597 --> 00:52:53,465
I do not have your silver.

458
00:52:53,485 --> 00:52:55,485
- Ah!
- Not yet.

459
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,194
Well, that's perfect, isn't it?

460
00:53:00,195 --> 00:53:03,610
The goddess has promised to
provide you with payment.

461
00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:05,515
OK. I'm done with you lot.

462
00:53:09,755 --> 00:53:11,945
I know, in my heart, that my sister is alive.

463
00:53:13,045 --> 00:53:14,956
I still have to find her!

464
00:53:14,957 --> 00:53:18,824
Yeah, well... good luck with that, priestess.

465
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:19,965
Dagen, wait!

466
00:53:57,545 --> 00:54:00,007
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

467
00:54:00,008 --> 00:54:03,965
- This mission is suicide.
- It's suicide alone.

468
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,734
Take my chances.

469
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:10,421
You can come with me... if you like.

470
00:54:11,621 --> 00:54:13,470
I want to see this through.

471
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,929
- Take care of Thane.
- Wait!

472
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,920
Teela?

473
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,015
No.

474
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,580
I'm sorry.

475
00:54:58,555 --> 00:54:59,915
Nothing has changed.

476
00:55:04,145 --> 00:55:05,855
My promise is good.

477
00:55:08,455 --> 00:55:09,954
One bounty.

478
00:55:11,455 --> 00:55:13,455
We leave at dawn.

479
00:55:33,715 --> 00:55:35,065
Teela?

480
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,125
You should rest.

481
00:56:29,425 --> 00:56:31,417
I've no need.

482
00:56:32,517 --> 00:56:36,517
Nor I. Sleep doesn't come so easily, now.

483
00:56:36,565 --> 00:56:40,544
Before this, I would sleep like a babe.

484
00:56:49,835 --> 00:56:51,885
This is very clever.

485
00:56:52,686 --> 00:56:56,504
Teela... you're a healer.

486
00:56:56,505 --> 00:57:00,505
Are you able to heal... anyone?

487
00:57:01,475 --> 00:57:05,475
Those with... pure intent, who have
faith to heal and be healed... yes.

488
00:57:08,765 --> 00:57:10,652
Am I pure enough?

489
00:57:10,653 --> 00:57:14,475
C- can your goddess... can she heal me...
my... my leg?

490
00:57:15,783 --> 00:57:17,083
Please?

491
00:57:41,675 --> 00:57:43,555
I'm sorry, Marek.

492
00:57:44,155 --> 00:57:46,245
It is not the will of the goddess.

493
00:57:47,145 --> 00:57:48,489
What?

494
00:57:49,689 --> 00:57:51,454
Why? Why?

495
00:57:51,455 --> 00:57:55,455
Your leg... it's a deliberate mark, from the gods.

496
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,870
A reminder of the darkness inside you.

497
00:57:58,905 --> 00:58:02,905
I'm good! I know I am. There's no...
there's no darkness inside of me!

498
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:07,175
We all harbor darkness... and all light.

499
00:58:15,215 --> 00:58:17,494
Then why am I different?

500
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:19,275
And why can't I be healed?

501
00:58:59,785 --> 00:59:02,394
How recent do you think this Ogre trail is?

502
00:59:02,395 --> 00:59:04,314
Less than a day, I'd wager.

503
00:59:04,315 --> 00:59:08,315
- Are Vitalian soldiers trained in tracking?
- Aye. But men... not Ogres.

504
00:59:12,655 --> 00:59:14,864
Why become a soldier?

505
00:59:14,865 --> 00:59:18,865
A chance to see the world...
and swing a sword at it.

506
00:59:19,335 --> 00:59:21,004
And you?

507
00:59:21,005 --> 00:59:24,484
- Why did I chose the order of Anisette?
- Aye.

508
00:59:24,485 --> 00:59:26,854
It was my sister, who was first called.

509
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,542
Greatly upsetting our father.

510
00:59:28,543 --> 00:59:31,494
I promised I would never follow in her footsteps.

511
00:59:31,995 --> 00:59:33,895
Nor did I desire to.

512
00:59:33,896 --> 00:59:36,314
Then, I found out he planned
to trade me to a nobleman

513
00:59:36,315 --> 00:59:40,315
for a tract of land. I refused
and ran to Caeryn and the order.

514
00:59:41,395 --> 00:59:44,124
The goddess has been my life, since.

515
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:47,524
Not many girls would pass up a
chance to marry a nobleman.

516
00:59:47,525 --> 00:59:50,316
I refused to be traded like property.

517
00:59:50,317 --> 00:59:52,729
Well, we all sell ourselves
for something, in the end.

518
00:59:52,764 --> 00:59:54,907
That's rather bleak.

519
00:59:55,907 --> 00:59:57,705
Life is bleak.

520
01:00:02,455 --> 01:00:04,874
The imprint is deeper here.

521
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:08,875
And lengthened... the Ogre was running.

522
01:00:09,055 --> 01:00:12,925
- Running? For what?
- From what?

523
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,665
I have little experience with these creatures.

524
01:00:20,335 --> 01:00:23,837
Following blindly... is reckless.

525
01:00:25,637 --> 01:00:27,205
What do you suggest?

526
01:00:28,805 --> 01:00:32,484
I say we get up high... spy out the land.

527
01:00:33,485 --> 01:00:35,685
Learn what... might be waiting for us.

528
01:00:38,395 --> 01:00:39,900
We don't have time.

529
01:00:39,901 --> 01:00:42,144
If your sister's still alive...

530
01:00:42,145 --> 01:00:44,524
there's no telling how much longer she has.

531
01:00:44,525 --> 01:00:46,525
We have the trail, let's keep going.

532
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,375
Orcs.

533
01:01:21,575 --> 01:01:23,144
He chose his own path.

534
01:01:23,145 --> 01:01:26,410
He may have been taken captive.
He's likely still alive.

535
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:28,285
Maybe.

536
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:30,174
The goddess has her purposes.

537
01:01:30,175 --> 01:01:32,264
Dagen's fate is no longer our concern.

538
01:01:32,265 --> 01:01:34,814
I've heard enough of your damned goddess!

539
01:01:34,815 --> 01:01:37,474
What good is she to me, to you, to anyone?

540
01:01:37,475 --> 01:01:39,924
Maybe Dagen had it right.

541
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:44,009
Your temple is burned. Your
sister is probably dead.

542
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:47,794
And chances are, we're probably
going to die here, too.

543
01:01:47,795 --> 01:01:51,795
Maybe I'm not good enough... for you
and your goddess, to care about,

544
01:01:52,661 --> 01:01:56,661
but I know this. I'm not like your goddess.

545
01:01:57,707 --> 01:02:00,555
I wouldn't leave a friend to
die, alone, in the wilderness.

546
01:02:03,031 --> 01:02:05,103
The same way Dagen left us?

547
01:02:11,105 --> 01:02:14,159
- What was that?
- We need to move. Now!

548
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:19,006
We need to find a clearing!

549
01:02:19,007 --> 01:02:21,975
We'll have a better chance of
fighting, if we can see it.

550
01:02:41,623 --> 01:02:43,790
Go on! Don't look in his eyes!

551
01:02:43,825 --> 01:02:47,545
- Blind me! I have looked directly into his eyes!
- Do we keep running or make a stand?!

552
01:02:47,642 --> 01:02:49,336
Keep running!

553
01:02:50,734 --> 01:02:54,231
- I thought we needed to find a clearing?!
- I'm trying!

554
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,815
Stop playing around! Marek, run!

555
01:03:36,265 --> 01:03:39,736
- What was that?
- I don't wanna know.

556
01:03:40,937 --> 01:03:42,421
There's a clearing ahead!

557
01:04:09,665 --> 01:04:11,665
We should have scouted.

558
01:04:23,615 --> 01:04:25,211
Into the trees!

559
01:04:27,795 --> 01:04:29,488
Leave me, I can make it!

560
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:31,978
Put me down! Put me dow...

561
01:04:31,979 --> 01:04:34,371
- Shut up and hold on!
- Leave me!

562
01:04:36,657 --> 01:04:39,353
Faster! Run faster!

563
01:04:58,373 --> 01:05:00,364
Over here, you brute!

564
01:05:02,055 --> 01:05:03,355
Pretty!

565
01:05:08,929 --> 01:05:12,316
Marek! Forget about us! You must find the stone!

566
01:05:12,317 --> 01:05:14,309
The goddess leads you!

567
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:40,535
Why won't you heal me?

568
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,881
Anisette, hear my prayer.

569
01:06:15,217 --> 01:06:18,360
<i>I have failed you, goddess.</i>

570
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:24,260
<i>My friends are going to die. I was alone.
I was alone. I'm alone.</i>

571
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:30,405
<i>Heal me. Heal me, so I can save my friends!</i>

572
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:33,878
<i>Anisette, if you hear me, answer.</i>

573
01:06:33,879 --> 01:06:36,970
<i>If you hear me... answer.</i>

574
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:41,332
<i>Answer me.</i>

575
01:06:42,134 --> 01:06:43,716
<i>Answer me.</i>

576
01:06:44,916 --> 01:06:46,610
<i>Answer me!</i>

577
01:06:50,437 --> 01:06:51,787
<i>Answer me.</i>

578
01:06:59,283 --> 01:07:01,870
<i>You're wrong!</i>

579
01:07:01,871 --> 01:07:03,863
<i>You're wrong about me.</i>

580
01:07:12,133 --> 01:07:14,217
To hell with the gods!

581
01:08:57,285 --> 01:09:00,354
What about a last meal, or something?

582
01:09:00,355 --> 01:09:01,954
Some meat?

583
01:09:01,955 --> 01:09:03,640
Ale would be nice.

584
01:09:06,915 --> 01:09:08,539
Thanks very much.

585
01:10:26,043 --> 01:10:28,830
Marek. Thanks for it.

586
01:10:29,831 --> 01:10:31,914
Quiet... I'm concentrating.

587
01:10:39,293 --> 01:10:41,179
Thank you... very much.

588
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,914
Don't mind me, I'm just a bit foxy.

589
01:11:07,881 --> 01:11:10,168
You have impeccable timing, Marek.

590
01:11:10,169 --> 01:11:13,184
The ugly one had a look in his eye I didn't like.

591
01:11:13,685 --> 01:11:15,496
Yep, yep, OK.

592
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:22,890
This is yours.

593
01:11:23,091 --> 01:11:24,328
Oh, ho-ho-ho!

594
01:11:24,349 --> 01:11:28,349
Oh, my God! And I thought you'd deserted me!

595
01:11:30,715 --> 01:11:32,345
Where are the others?

596
01:11:35,409 --> 01:11:37,395
You left them?

597
01:11:37,595 --> 01:11:40,274
- Smart.
- No.

598
01:11:40,275 --> 01:11:42,245
We're going to rescue them.

599
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:44,945
The Ogre?

600
01:11:45,745 --> 01:11:47,749
Fyke, Marek!

601
01:11:48,349 --> 01:11:49,694
Why?

602
01:11:50,594 --> 01:11:52,250
Because they're our friends.

603
01:11:55,594 --> 01:11:57,884
And I don't have many friends.

604
01:11:58,685 --> 01:12:00,380
And neither do you.

605
01:12:02,955 --> 01:12:05,014
I spotted the Ogre trail, not far from here.

606
01:12:05,015 --> 01:12:07,065
It's just over that ridge.

607
01:12:07,465 --> 01:12:08,945
Alright.

608
01:12:17,845 --> 01:12:19,778
Wait! Wait! Wait!

609
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:48,400
- Yes, alright.
- Is this the Ogre's cave?

610
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,393
I'd bet my magic wand we're at his doorstep.

611
01:12:59,757 --> 01:13:02,194
You know, you're asking the impossible, right?

612
01:13:02,195 --> 01:13:04,272
Surely not impossible for you.

613
01:13:05,872 --> 01:13:08,705
I just want to make sure
you'll appreciate my success.

614
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:16,925
- What was that for?
- I'm probably falling in love.

615
01:13:33,933 --> 01:13:35,904
<i>Who's out there?</i>

616
01:13:36,405 --> 01:13:38,055
<i>Is there someone there?</i>

617
01:13:39,356 --> 01:13:40,834
<i>Please!</i>

618
01:13:41,135 --> 01:13:42,992
<i>Are you here to help me?!</i>

619
01:13:44,393 --> 01:13:45,979
<i>Who's there?</i>

620
01:13:47,737 --> 01:13:49,708
<i>I'm trapped! I can't get out.</i>

621
01:13:51,315 --> 01:13:53,995
<i>Is there anyone there? I-I hear you.</i>

622
01:13:56,695 --> 01:13:58,395
<i>Is that someone out there?</i>

623
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:04,494
<i>Who's there? Who's there? I'm in here!
I'm in here!</i>

624
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:09,915
Psst! Anybody home?

625
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,874
Who are you? Just... get me out of here.

626
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:17,918
Shhh, sh-sh-sh. Calm down, boy.

627
01:14:19,919 --> 01:14:21,799
Is there anyone else in there with you?

628
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,034
A tiresome priestess, maybe?

629
01:14:24,035 --> 01:14:25,910
No. I'm-I'm all alone.

630
01:14:26,111 --> 01:14:28,825
Alright, just... sit tight.

631
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,194
Please! You have to save me!

632
01:14:32,195 --> 01:14:36,195
Please! Please! Get me out of here!

633
01:14:36,865 --> 01:14:38,626
Don't... don't leave me!

634
01:14:39,127 --> 01:14:41,102
<i>Where did you go?</i>

635
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:43,586
<i>Come back! Come back!</i>

636
01:14:44,387 --> 01:14:45,866
<i>Please! Please, help!</i>

637
01:14:46,067 --> 01:14:47,465
Hello, beautiful.

638
01:14:47,466 --> 01:14:50,454
I'm Dagen. Your insane sister
sent me here to rescue you.

639
01:14:50,455 --> 01:14:54,455
<i>- I'm not important. Take this.
- Please, get me out of here!</i>

640
01:14:58,367 --> 01:15:02,367
Take the stone. Bring it to the Paladins
at Sung Hill. They can protect it.

641
01:15:03,107 --> 01:15:04,785
Listen, sweetheart...

642
01:15:04,786 --> 01:15:08,514
We have gone through a lot of
trouble to get you out of here.

643
01:15:08,945 --> 01:15:12,254
<i>Come back, please! Please, get me out of here!</i>

644
01:15:12,655 --> 01:15:13,855
Shut it!

645
01:15:13,856 --> 01:15:17,524
You fool! Escape with the stone!
Nothing else matters!

646
01:15:18,595 --> 01:15:21,785
You remind me a lot of your sister.

647
01:15:25,478 --> 01:15:29,478
<i>Go! It's coming! Let's go and get out here!
It's coming!</i>

648
01:15:36,068 --> 01:15:40,068
<i>Let me go! Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahh!</i>

649
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:52,924
Dagen move!

650
01:16:03,402 --> 01:16:07,051
Did you two want to quit lying
around and give me a hand?

651
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:11,544
Dagen. By the gods, never thought
I'd be happy to see you again.

652
01:16:11,545 --> 01:16:15,545
Yeah, well, I was missing Teela's sunny demeanor.

653
01:16:16,161 --> 01:16:18,535
- Where's Marek?
- She's here.

654
01:16:19,495 --> 01:16:21,290
We're going to get you out of here.

655
01:16:26,663 --> 01:16:28,395
Ready, push!

656
01:16:31,476 --> 01:16:33,424
OK, OK. I'm, uh...

657
01:16:34,425 --> 01:16:36,868
- Uhh...
- Maybe we could the... Ogre to...

658
01:16:36,869 --> 01:16:40,136
He doesn't take them out to play with
them, he takes them out to eat them.

659
01:16:41,525 --> 01:16:43,050
I have an idea.

660
01:16:43,215 --> 01:16:47,014
Teela, remember that spell, in hideout?

661
01:16:47,215 --> 01:16:49,915
The one you were practicing on the kettle?

662
01:16:50,343 --> 01:16:51,710
Yes.

663
01:16:51,745 --> 01:16:53,915
Anisette, be merciful.

664
01:16:55,165 --> 01:16:56,865
Hang on to each other...

665
01:16:56,866 --> 01:16:58,214
tightly.

666
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:05,510
Ready?

667
01:17:24,635 --> 01:17:26,935
Hold on, Teela, I've got you.

668
01:18:17,027 --> 01:18:18,323
Marek.

669
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:30,387
- What was that?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

670
01:18:30,435 --> 01:18:32,434
- It was the only way. I didn't mean...
- Yeah, well, it worked...

671
01:18:32,435 --> 01:18:34,734
but, never do it again.

672
01:18:34,735 --> 01:18:36,195
Did you find Caeryn?

673
01:18:38,605 --> 01:18:39,914
Caeryn?

674
01:18:40,405 --> 01:18:44,405
- Yeah, together, we might be able to move it.
- Yeah, Yeah.

675
01:18:44,775 --> 01:18:46,060
Push!

676
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:56,730
- Sister!
- She's out. She's out.

677
01:18:58,185 --> 01:19:00,015
I'm gonna need something sharp!

678
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:20,853
This way!

679
01:19:35,922 --> 01:19:39,520
Come on! That way! Come on. Come on. Come on.

680
01:19:50,293 --> 01:19:51,975
I feel fresh air moving!

681
01:19:52,005 --> 01:19:54,166
This must be another way out.

682
01:19:54,167 --> 01:19:55,915
I see a light. This way!

683
01:20:00,241 --> 01:20:01,741
Get out, get out!

684
01:20:16,555 --> 01:20:18,524
Think you can make it?

685
01:20:19,325 --> 01:20:22,314
Probably, but how are we gonna
get the rest of you out?

686
01:20:22,395 --> 01:20:23,889
Help him.

687
01:20:31,855 --> 01:20:33,349
What is that?

688
01:20:43,207 --> 01:20:45,897
I've got a bad feeling about this.

689
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:04,539
You wanna eat us? You'll have to crawl
in after us. We're not coming out.

690
01:21:04,996 --> 01:21:07,114
I'm not so sure about that!

691
01:21:08,314 --> 01:21:10,310
Here come the spiders!

692
01:22:01,408 --> 01:22:02,905
I'm out of arrows!

693
01:22:24,959 --> 01:22:27,759
Quickly... before it recovers!

694
01:22:34,042 --> 01:22:35,539
Oh, come on!

695
01:22:40,628 --> 01:22:43,724
There's the entrance! We can make it if we run!

696
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:52,465
Well done, wizard.

697
01:24:58,952 --> 01:25:00,449
Is everyone alright?

698
01:25:03,941 --> 01:25:05,935
You did it.

699
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,633
We did it.

700
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,285
Are you kidding?

701
01:25:16,985 --> 01:25:18,511
There's no treasure!

702
01:25:18,912 --> 01:25:22,912
I have always heard... that Ogres...
amass hordes and hordes of treasure.

703
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:26,965
That belongs to the temple.

704
01:25:27,765 --> 01:25:30,677
We must hurry. This country is unsafe, at night.

705
01:25:30,678 --> 01:25:32,245
At night?

706
01:25:32,945 --> 01:25:36,945
Hardly imagine anything worse...
than this country, during the day.

707
01:26:04,419 --> 01:26:07,115
How much for an Ogre's ear?

708
01:26:08,005 --> 01:26:09,965
An Ogre's ear, you say?

709
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:14,465
I'd say that's worth... a free drink...
and a smidgen of respect.

710
01:26:17,961 --> 01:26:19,261
Done!

711
01:26:32,374 --> 01:26:35,071
I won't stop until I've reached the monastery.

712
01:26:35,106 --> 01:26:37,769
The Paladin will send the team their silver.

713
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:39,544
I'm afraid for you.

714
01:26:39,545 --> 01:26:41,254
Why must you travel alone?

715
01:26:41,255 --> 01:26:43,184
My path is sure.

716
01:26:43,185 --> 01:26:45,134
I have no fear.

717
01:26:45,135 --> 01:26:48,384
And the goddess says you are to
stay here for the time being.

718
01:26:48,385 --> 01:26:50,414
I must take the stone to the Paladin.

719
01:26:50,915 --> 01:26:52,905
Farewell, my sister.

720
01:26:56,065 --> 01:26:58,070
Now, go. Be with your friends.

721
01:27:12,588 --> 01:27:16,588
<i>I said, you take that staff and you give it
to the captain... he knows right where to...</i>

722
01:27:26,015 --> 01:27:27,944
Maybe I'll... become a farmer?

723
01:27:27,945 --> 01:27:30,577
- Find a soft woman to settle down with.
- Oh.

724
01:27:32,377 --> 01:27:33,945
To adventure!

725
01:27:35,645 --> 01:27:38,325
- To a life of dignity.
- To riches and gold!

726
01:27:39,305 --> 01:28:39,869
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
