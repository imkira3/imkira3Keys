2
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,385
Stop now.

3
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,804
Tell me where it is.

4
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:28,480
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

5
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:33,026
I don't know what
you are talking about.

6
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,071
Is it a secret you will die for?

7
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,533
- Please.
- As you wish.

8
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,326
Wait!

9
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,624
My God, forgive me.

10
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,086
In the sacristy...

11
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,756
...the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

12
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,092
Beneath the Rose.

13
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:38,091
Thank you.

14
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:54,274
Symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past.

15
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:59,154
As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words...

16
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,366
...but which words?

17
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,703
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind.

18
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,206
- Hatred, racism.
- Ku Klux Klan.

19
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:14,670
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would
disagree with you in Spain.

20
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,340
There, they are robes
worn by priests.

21
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,676
Now this symbol. Anyone?

22
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,052
Evil.

23
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,471
In English, please.

24
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,722
Devil's pitchfork.

25
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,100
Poor, poor Poseidon.

26
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:33,814
That is his trident. A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

27
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,190
Now this symbol.

28
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,694
- Madonna and child.
- Faith. Christianity.

29
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,656
No. No, it's the pagan god
Horus and his mother, Isis...

30
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,409
...centuries before
the birth of Christ.

31
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,329
Understanding our past
determines actively...

32
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,582
...our ability to understand
the present.

33
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:57,421
So how do we sift truth from belief?

34
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,216
How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally...

35
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,510
...and thereby define ourselves?

36
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:08,056
How do we penetrate years,
centuries, of historical distortion...

37
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,310
...to find original truth?

38
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,730
Tonight, this will be our quest.

39
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,233
I still think that his whole take on phi
was a little far-fetched.

40
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:24,614
I don't think so. I think that the
golden ratio is everywhere in nature.

41
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,075
Sure, I can do that.

42
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,245
My son is a student
of yours at Harvard.

43
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,664
- Michael Culp? He adores you.
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,916
He says you're the best teacher
he's ever had.

45
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:39,087
Ms. Culp, I think I already gave
Michael an A-minus.

46
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,672
He told me. Thank you.

47
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,174
Mr. Langdon?

48
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,217
Hi.

49
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,761
Bonjour, professor.

50
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:51,975
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBI.

51
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,062
Will you take a look
at this photo, please?

52
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,106
My police chief, Capitaine Fache,
had hoped...

53
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,902
...considering your expertise
and the markings on the body...

54
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,570
...you might assist us.

55
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,373
Will you excuse me a moment?

56
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,461
I was supposed to have
drinks with him.

57
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,879
Yes, we know.

58
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,341
We found your name
in his daily planner.

59
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,220
He never showed.
I waited for over an hour.

60
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,184
Why would someone do this to him?

61
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,479
Oh, you misunderstand, professor.

62
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,940
He was shot, yes.

63
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,818
But what you see
in the photograph...

64
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,612
...Monsieur Saunière did to himself.

65
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,994
Teacher, all four are dead.

66
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,957
The Sénéchaux and the
Grand Master himself.

67
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,210
Then I assume
you have the location.

68
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,505
Confirmed by all.

69
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,091
Independently.

70
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:11,179
I had feared the Priory's penchant
for secrecy might prevail.

71
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,854
The prospect of death
is strong motivation.

72
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,693
It is here.

73
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,362
In Paris, Teacher.

74
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:33,785
It hides beneath the Rose
in Saint-Sulpice.

75
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,038
You will go forth, Silas.

76
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,448
I chastise my body.

77
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,363
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.

78
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,998
Okay.

79
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,760
- Mr. Langdon.
- Yes.

80
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,179
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.

81
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,640
You like our pyramid?

82
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,891
It's magnificent.

83
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,644
A scar on the face of Paris.

84
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,606
After me, please.

85
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,407
It's the pairing
of those two pyramids.

86
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,200
It's unique.

87
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,536
The two are geometric echoes.

88
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,746
Fascinating.

89
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,002
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

90
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,592
How well did you know the curator?

91
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,012
Not at all. We met only once.

92
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,514
We were on a...

93
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,892
On a panel together.

94
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,686
Something is funny?

95
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,563
We didn't agree on much.

96
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,317
Frankly, I was surprised
when he contacted me.

97
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,744
Could we take the stairs?

98
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,595
So Saunière requested
tonight's meeting.

99
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,930
Yes.

100
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,598
How? Did he call you?

101
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,520
E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.

102
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,398
Had something to discuss.

103
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,691
What?

104
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,990
You seem uncomfortable.

105
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,759
- Are any of those real?
- Of course not.

106
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:03,680
So you know something
of security procedures.

107
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:08,101
Well, I know video surveillance in
a museum this size is cost-prohibitive.

108
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,812
Most now rely on containment.

109
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,190
Yes, forget about
keeping the criminals out.

110
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,568
Now we keep them in.

111
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:26,202
The Grand Gallery.
This is where you found the body.

112
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,163
How would you know that?

113
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:34,127
I recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable.

114
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,846
Dear God.

115
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,935
Let's cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.

116
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,022
Many call Opus Dei
a brainwashing cult.

117
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,358
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

118
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,278
- We are a simple Catholic church.
- Simple?

119
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,198
With a brand-new $47-million
headquarters in Manhattan.

120
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,493
Our followers are generous,
should we apologize for that?

121
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,995
Perhaps a less defensive tack,
Your Eminence.

122
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,331
The press continue
to be harsh with us.

123
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,295
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.

124
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,547
We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.

125
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,383
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

126
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,888
Does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity, tithing...

127
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,225
...and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?

128
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,896
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.

129
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,024
Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetically...

130
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,819
...in the cloisters
of our residential halls.

131
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,322
But we are all united in God's work
around the world.

132
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,326
Surely that is an admirable way
to lead one's life.

133
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,412
Why are some media referring
to Opus Dei as "God's mafia"?

134
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,333
Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.

135
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,420
And because the war finally
draws to a close.

136
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,633
- Bishop, we need to stay on message.
- That will be all, Michael, thank you.

137
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,051
Aringarosa.

138
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,889
Silas has succeeded.
The legend is true.

139
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,100
It hides beneath the Rose.

140
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,436
My part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled.

141
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,023
I meet the council in an hour.

142
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,069
I will have your money tonight,
Teacher.

143
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,114
The Vitruvian Man.

144
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,534
It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most famous sketches.

145
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,661
And the star on his skin?

146
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,121
A pentacle.

147
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,956
And its meaning?

148
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,541
The pentacle is ancient.

149
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,630
Symbols carry different meanings
in different settings.

150
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,425
This symbol, professor.
This setting.

151
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,802
The pentacle is
a pagan religious icon.

152
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,054
Devil worship.

153
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:55,018
No. No, no, no.
The pentacle before that.

154
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,687
This is a symbol for Venus.

155
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,690
It represents the female half
of all things.

156
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,068
It's a concept called "the divine
goddess" by religious historians.

157
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,823
You are telling me that
Saunière's last act on earth...

158
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:13,453
...was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest? Why?

159
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,082
Captain Fache,
obviously I can't tell you why.

160
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,587
I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol...

161
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,506
...and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

162
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,091
- Is that so?
- Yes.

163
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,509
Then...

164
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,679
...what do you make of this?

165
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:36,351
"O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint."

166
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,729
It's a phrase.
Doesn't mean anything, not to me.

167
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,608
What would you do if you had such
limited time to send a message?

168
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,697
Well, I suppose
I'd try to identify my killer.

169
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,868
Precisely.

170
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,161
So, professor...

171
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,706
Officer Neveu.

172
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,375
Please, pardon the interruption.

173
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,584
This is not the time.

174
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,878
I received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

175
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,880
...and I've deciphered the code.

176
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,799
It's a Fibonacci sequence.

177
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,385
That's the code Saunière
left on the floor.

178
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,845
Headquarters sent me
to explain, captain.

179
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,305
It is the Fibonacci sequence.

180
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,974
The numbers are out of order.

181
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,977
But before that, I have an urgent
message for Professor Langdon.

182
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,603
Right?

183
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,063
Pardon me?

184
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,485
I'm Sophie Neveu,
French police, Cryptology.

185
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,696
Your embassy called Division.

186
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,746
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

187
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,084
This is the number of your
embassy's messaging service.

188
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,086
Well, thank you.

189
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,554
Hello, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.

190
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,182
Miss Neveu? This...

191
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,934
No. That's the right number.

192
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,603
You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.

193
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,813
But I'm getting...

194
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,899
It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.

195
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,953
Professor Langdon,
do not react to this message.

196
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,415
You must follow my directions
very closely and, above all...

197
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,917
...reveal nothing to Captain Fache.

198
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,170
You are in grave danger.

199
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,018
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

200
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,895
Good evening, Sister.

201
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,691
I need you to show someone
our church tonight.

202
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,526
Of course, Father.

203
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,779
But so late?

204
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,031
Wouldn't tomorrow...?

205
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,952
This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.

206
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,122
It would be my pleasure.

207
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,108
There's been an accident. A friend.

208
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,318
I have to fly home in the morning.

209
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,778
I see.

210
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:38,032
Is there a restroom I could use? I just
wanna splash some water on my face.

211
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,367
Yes.

212
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,831
She said it is meaningless.

213
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,916
Mathematical joke.

214
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,752
Is it meaningless?

215
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,465
I'll take another look
when I come back.

216
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,805
I'm sorry. Of course.

217
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,825
Do you have a message
from Saunière?

218
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,161
What are you talking about?

219
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,746
Crazy old man.

220
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,541
You have me confused with
someone else.

221
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,501
I was asked to come here
and consult.

222
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,587
No, you are
sous surveillance cachée.

223
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,380
Yes, and...

224
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,174
What?

225
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,261
Bring the suspect to the crime scene
and hope he incriminates himself.

226
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,512
Suspect?

227
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,764
Check your jacket pocket.

228
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,350
Just look.

229
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,106
GPS tracking dot.

230
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,359
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

231
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,113
The agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket...

232
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,617
...in case you tried to run.

233
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,829
We have you on a little leash,
professor.

234
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,382
Why would I try to run?
I didn't do anything.

235
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,637
So, what do you think about
the fourth line of text...

236
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,681
...Fache wiped clean
before you arrived?

237
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,691
He brought you here to force a
confession, Professor Langdon.

238
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,280
He's still in there?
What's he doing?

239
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,413
Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?

240
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,123
He is sure you're guilty.

241
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,380
When did Saunière contact you?

242
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,631
- Today?
- Yes, yes.

243
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,883
What time? What time?

244
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,927
At 3. Around 3. Three.

245
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,846
The gallery alarm was triggered at 8.
You were...

246
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,723
- I was giving a lecture.
- At 9.

247
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:12,687
You had the privacy light on
in your hotel room until 8:30, right?

248
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,607
We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.

249
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,986
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

250
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,531
And by then whatever Saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

251
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,825
Stop it! Just stop!

252
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,952
Who are you?

253
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,496
What are you talking about?
Tell you what?

254
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,041
Maybe who really killed him.

255
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,259
The Fibonacci sequence.

256
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,636
I believe Saunière wrote it...

257
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,723
...so his investigation would
include cryptographers.

258
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,562
That's quite a leap, isn't it?

259
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,188
No.

260
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,108
And the letters.

261
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,401
"P.S."

262
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,236
P.S., postscript.

263
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:10,161
"Princess Sophie."
Yeah. Silly, I know.

264
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,247
But I was only a girl
when I lived with him.

265
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,339
Jacques Saunière
was my grandfather.

266
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,847
Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.

267
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,851
If you help me understand why...

268
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,730
...I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

269
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,734
Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?

270
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,778
No.

271
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,449
If we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.

272
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,796
What exactly do you propose?

273
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,141
Saunière was reading his book.

274
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,477
"Blood trail."

275
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,231
Excuse me, captain.

276
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,485
Crypto called.
They identified the code.

277
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,487
Neveu told us already.

278
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,491
I should have fired her on the spot,
barging in like that.

279
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,618
Yes.

280
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,329
Except they didn't send Neveu.

281
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,916
What?

282
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,503
Captain, look at this.

283
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,464
He jumped!

284
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,924
Shit.

285
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,346
He's moving again. And fast.

286
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,723
He must be in a car.

287
00:23:56,143 --> 00:24:00,354
He's going south
on Pont du Carrousel.

288
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,364
Bastard.

289
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,974
That cop will check
the whole lower floor.

290
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,897
I will only take a moment.

291
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,690
Of course.

292
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,576
He is much older than I remember.

293
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,716
I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.

294
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,771
He phoned my office today.
Several times.

295
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,983
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

296
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,862
I thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.

297
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,451
It seems when
he couldn't speak to me...

298
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,579
...he reached out to you.

299
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,463
Whatever he needed
so badly to say...

300
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,342
...he found neither of us in time.

301
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,996
- Wait a minute.
- Professor?

302
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,748
Come on.

303
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,667
It can't be that easy.

304
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,879
This is wrong.
Yeah. See? This is wrong.

305
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:36,051
The Fibonacci numbers only
make sense when they're in order.

306
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,720
These are scrambled.

307
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:41,682
If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

308
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,726
Would you hold this, please?

309
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,022
This phrase is meaningless.

310
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:54,653
Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.

311
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,988
An anagram.

312
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,501
You have eidetic memory?

313
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,380
Not quite. But I can pretty much
remember what I see.

314
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,737
Anagram is right.

315
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,699
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint"
becomes:

316
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,535
"Leonardo da Vinci.
The Mona Lisa."

317
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:47,414
Professor, the Mona LiSa
is right over here.

318
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:58,634
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

319
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,594
Smart to hit the truck.

320
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,515
What, you admire him now?

321
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,227
We're stupid.
Who did we leave at the museum?

322
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,146
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

323
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,566
Her smile is in
the lower spatial frequencies.

324
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,362
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

325
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,613
Why?

326
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:23,117
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

327
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,412
Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.

328
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,706
The sacred feminine.

329
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,458
Why do you say that?

330
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:35,921
Something Saunière said
the first time we came here.

331
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,467
There. Blood.

332
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,856
Hey.

333
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,235
"So dark the con of man."

334
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,322
No. It doesn't say that.

335
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,783
Is it another anagram?
Can you break it?

336
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,207
Professor, hurry. Hurry!

337
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,754
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

338
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:21,008
Demons. Omens. Codes.
Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

339
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,259
Madonna of the Rocks.

340
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,136
Da Vinci.

341
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,315
Careful. Careful.

342
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:47,618
This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.

343
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,513
Stay where you are!

344
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,849
Let go of the painting...

345
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,810
...and put it on the ground.

346
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,982
No. You put your gun down.

347
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,276
Now!

348
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,070
Or else I will destroy the painting.

349
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,407
Hurry up!

350
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,409
Slide your gun to me.

351
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,747
Be careful.

352
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,874
I never really liked this painting.

353
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,105
Run.

354
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,887
It was Saunière's.

355
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,473
I remember finding it once
when I was a girl.

356
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,560
He'd promised
he'd give it to me one day.

357
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,563
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

358
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,148
"So dark the con of man"?

359
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,983
No. Have you?

360
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,612
When you were a child, were you
aware of any secret gatherings?

361
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,157
Anything ritualistic in nature?

362
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,619
Meetings your grandfather
would've wanted kept secret?

363
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:57,247
Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?

364
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,375
The what? Why are you
asking these things?

365
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,045
The Priory of Sion is a myth.

366
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:07,716
One of the world's oldest and most
secret societies, with leaders like...

367
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,427
...Sir Isaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.

368
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,679
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.

369
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,390
They're guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to...

370
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,768
...as "the dark con of man."

371
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,811
But what secret?

372
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:25,651
The Priory of Sion protects
the source of God's power on earth.

373
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,453
I can't do this by myself.

374
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,915
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.

375
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,208
Please.

376
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,876
Even if we could get out of this...

377
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,544
Okay.

378
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,251
No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!

379
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,218
Well, that was...

380
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,232
We won't last long in this car.

381
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,277
Fache doesn't like to be eluded,
even on a good day.

382
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,279
We need to get out of sight.

383
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,966
Christ, give me strength.

384
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,524
You are a ghost.

385
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,154
Christ, give me strength.

386
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,710
Stealing in a house of God!

387
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,059
You are an angel.

388
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,772
Christ, give me strength.

389
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,425
You have powerful friends.

390
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,304
Bishop Aringarosa
has been kind to me.

391
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,892
I could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

392
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,229
A pity you couldn't wait for morning.

393
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,397
The light is not ideal.

394
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,402
Tell me, Sister, please,
of the Rose Line.

395
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,991
A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.

396
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:30,121
Set into the streets of Paris,
135 brass markers...

397
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,832
...mark the world's
first prime meridian...

398
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,502
...which passed through
this very church.

399
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,504
It hides beneath the Rose.

400
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,922
I'm sorry?

401
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,424
Sister.

402
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,430
I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.

403
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,768
I insist.

404
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,942
May the peace of the Lord
be with you.

405
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,237
And with you.

406
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,971
Gray Smart Car. Black roof.

407
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,725
Corner of Denain Boulevard
at the train station.

408
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,143
How could you let them get away?

409
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,271
Why not just shoot the damn painting?
Lmbecile!

410
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,316
You should put his cigar
out in your hand!

411
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,859
Get out of here!

412
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:48,616
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

413
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:54,039
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon's credit card.

414
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,749
A decoy, I'm sure.

415
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,376
All the same,
send an officer to the station.

416
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,254
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.

417
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,174
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

418
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:08,386
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

419
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,514
Robert Langdon is guilty.

420
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,233
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

421
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,278
We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.

422
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:45,298
Your police don't patrol this park.

423
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,645
Stay here.

424
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,565
Police.

425
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,317
What do you want?

426
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,209
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

427
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,547
Go and get something to eat.

428
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,736
Did it occur to you
that could be dangerous?

429
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,156
No. And now we have
a place to think.

430
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,366
Any ideas, professor?

431
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:40,121
You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.

432
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,626
"What's the next step?"

433
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,461
With him, it's always:

434
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,756
"Sophie, what's the next step?"

435
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,841
Puzzles.

436
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,426
Codes.

437
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,512
A treasure hunt.

438
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,226
To find his killer.

439
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,900
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

440
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,109
I hope not.

441
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,114
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

442
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,701
It all started over a thousand
years ago when a French king...

443
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,329
...conquered the holy city
of Jerusalem.

444
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,832
This crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history...

445
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,545
...was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood...

446
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,129
...the Priory of Sion...

447
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:34,384
...and their military arm,
the Knights Templar.

448
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,887
But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.

449
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:42,100
That was a cover to hide their
true goal, according to this myth.

450
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,770
Supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact...

451
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,814
...lost since the time of Christ.

452
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:52,151
An artifact, it was said,
the Church would kill to possess.

453
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,946
Did they find it,
this buried treasure?

454
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,407
Put it this way:

455
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,493
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

456
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,163
They quit the Holy Land
and traveled directly to Rome.

457
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,249
Whether they blackmailed
the papacy...

458
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,876
...or the Church bought their silence,
no one knows.

459
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:13,464
But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights...

460
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:17,302
...these Knights Templar,
of limitless power.

461
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,306
By the 1300s, the Templars
had grown too powerful.

462
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,890
Too threatening.

463
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,351
So the Vatican
issued secret orders...

464
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,479
...to be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.

465
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:33,234
The Pope had declared the
Knights Templar Satan worshipers...

466
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:37,989
...and said God had charged him with
cleansing the earth of these heretics.

467
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,617
The plan went off like clockwork.

468
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,786
The Templars
were all but exterminated.

469
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:48,207
The date was October 13th, 1307.
A Friday.

470
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,335
Friday the 13th.

471
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,588
The Pope sent troops
to claim the Priory's treasure...

472
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,381
...but they found nothing.

473
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,843
The few surviving
Knights of the Priory had vanished...

474
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,888
...and the search for their
sacred artifact began again.

475
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:06,225
What artifact? I've never
heard about any of this.

476
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,935
Yes, you have.

477
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,688
Almost everyone on earth has.

478
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,192
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

479
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:23,951
Please, Saunière thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?

480
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,245
Maybe more than that.

481
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:30,375
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

482
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:35,797
This metal here underneath is much
newer, and there's a modern ID stamp.

483
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,882
"Haxo 24."

484
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:43,221
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.

485
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:47,100
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.

486
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,936
He left us, professor.

487
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:55,692
And vingt-quatre Haxo,
it's not an ID stamp.

488
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,236
It's a street address.

489
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,659
This is Jacques Saunière.

490
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,870
Please leave a message
after the tone.

491
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,957
Please, Monsieur Saunière,
pick up the phone.

492
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,709
This is Sandrine Bieil.

493
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,211
I have called the list.

494
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,547
I fear the other guardians are dead.

495
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,049
The lie has been told.

496
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,301
The floor panel has been broken.

497
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,972
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.

498
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,391
Job 38, verse 11.

499
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,728
Do you know it, Sister?

500
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,273
Job 38:11.

501
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,152
Hitherto shalt thou come...

502
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,738
...but no further.

503
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,322
"But no further."

504
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,328
Do you mock me?

505
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,542
Where is the keystone?

506
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,128
I do not know.

507
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,297
No.

508
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,343
You are a sister of the Church...

509
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,682
...and yet you serve them:
The Priory.

510
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,895
Jesus had but one true message.
That...

511
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,793
Come, you saints of God.

512
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,379
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

513
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,883
To receive her soul.

514
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,888
And bring her to the sight
of the Almighty.

515
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:57,438
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

516
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,346
Welcome, bishop.

517
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,101
May Christ be with you.

518
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,061
And also with you.

519
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,897
It's been too long, Manuel.

520
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,442
I saw your press conference.

521
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,069
Very priestly.

522
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,612
Vultures.

523
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,116
But you need a good cover
to fly into Italy these days.

524
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,162
So how are things in Rome?

525
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,832
We serve at his pleasure.

526
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,295
Today is today.

527
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,381
But there are many tomorrows.

528
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,969
Vatican cellars.

529
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,763
1976.

530
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:16,934
Seventy-six, a year of independence.
How fitting.

531
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,731
I thought you'd like it.

532
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,442
I'll fetch the others.

533
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,797
Welcome, bishop.

534
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,386
This council is convened.

535
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,357
Our words shall never
pass these walls.

536
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,949
What business, say you?

537
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,994
As you know, my request for funds...

538
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:21,457
Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.

539
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,835
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, bishop?

540
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:28,255
The endeavor is complex.
Freedom has a high cost.

541
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,466
And, of course, you will deliver us.

542
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,177
How fortunate we are.

543
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:38,015
I only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.

544
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,475
How humble.

545
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,186
Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.

546
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,480
Were we to grant your request...

547
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:48,067
...when would
this mission commence?

548
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,069
- Actually, tonight.
- What?

549
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,196
- It has begun.
- We have not agreed.

550
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,906
How dare you presume to...

551
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,866
I do not presume, I act!

552
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,244
The Vatican's unwillingness
to support us...

553
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,037
...is both impious and cowardly.

554
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:04,375
Blood is being spilled because true
Christian values lie in ruins. No more!

555
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,254
This council has forgotten
its very purpose.

556
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,091
Tonight...

557
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,553
...the Grail will be destroyed.

558
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,682
The Priory's few remaining members
will be silenced.

559
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:31,861
I was contacted by a man
who calls himself only "the Teacher."

560
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,448
He knows a great deal
about this council.

561
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,367
And about the Priory.

562
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,343
Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...

563
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,763
...getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Boulogne.

564
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,362
Because of your expertise?

565
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,990
- I'm sorry?
- About the Priory.

566
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,659
Do you think that's why
Saunière sought you out?

567
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,330
I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

568
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:28,626
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

569
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:32,713
Once made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.

570
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,256
What was it?

571
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,271
How may I help you?

572
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,446
The door to the right, please.

573
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,960
That was quite a performance.

574
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:15,881
The little shit should know better
than to play politics with me.

575
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,472
I know I got in front of you,
old friend.

576
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,393
I did what I thought was best.

577
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,569
So...

578
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,820
...now what?

579
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,575
Now we wait for the Teacher's call.

580
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,631
Good evening. I am André Vernet,
the night manager.

581
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,428
I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

582
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,597
Yes.

583
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:06,807
Understood.

584
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,935
Keys are often passed on
and first-time users...

585
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,813
...are sometimes
uncertain of protocol.

586
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,651
Keys are essentially
numbered Swiss accounts.

587
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,572
Often willed through generations.

588
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,952
Is it yours, mademoiselle?

589
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,082
The shortest safety-deposit-box
lease is 50 years.

590
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,127
And what's your longest account?

591
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,921
Quite a bit longer.

592
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,007
Technologies change,
keys are updated.

593
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,303
But our accounts date back
to the beginning of banking itself.

594
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,893
Once the computer
confirms your key...

595
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,480
...enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.

596
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,358
The room is yours,
as long as you like.

597
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,658
What if I lost track
of my account number?

598
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,701
How might I recover it?

599
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,539
I'm afraid each key is paired
with a 10-digit number...

600
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,792
...known only to the account bearer.

601
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,044
I hope you manage to remember it.

602
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,339
A single wrong entry
disables the system.

603
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,305
- Ten.
- Ten.

604
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:31,016
Your grandfather's
Fibonacci sequence.

605
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,563
Scrambled, unscrambled?

606
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,816
Unscrambled.

607
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,151
It's your key.

608
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,576
Funny, I don't even like history.

609
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:57,209
I've never seen much good come
from looking to the past.

610
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,218
Moment of truth.

611
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,390
My God. I don't believe this.

612
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,975
A rose.

613
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,648
The rose was a symbol
for the Holy Grail.

614
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,111
Forgive the intrusion.

615
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:09,865
I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than I anticipated.

616
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,618
You must follow me, please.

617
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,161
For your own safety.

618
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,121
You knew they were coming?

619
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:19,083
My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.

620
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,127
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

621
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,588
It includes a safe-passage clause.

622
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:25,964
Safe passage?

623
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,803
If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.

624
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,473
In there?

625
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,448
Hey, is there a problem?

626
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,284
Good evening, sir. Police.

627
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:58,831
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

628
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,332
- English?
- Yes.

629
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,378
We are looking for two criminals.

630
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,465
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.

631
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,594
Would you mind opening the hold?

632
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,682
Please. You think they trust us,
the wages I get paid?

633
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,725
You don't have keys
to your own truck?

634
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,645
It's armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.

635
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,897
You mind? I'm on a schedule here.

636
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:31,864
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?

637
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,407
What?

638
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,369
This piece of shit.

639
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,371
Forty euros in Barbès.

640
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,706
Yours for 35.

641
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,291
No, no, no.

642
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,251
- Thirty.
- No. It's okay, it's okay.

643
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,711
Come on, 30, eh?

644
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,212
I said, no!

645
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:48,922
Move along!

646
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,437
Now we wait.

647
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,231
The Teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money.

648
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,818
You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.

649
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:14,406
Yes, I have. And I have given him
an angel to do his will.

650
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,160
For surely there is no better
soldier for God than my Silas.

651
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:22,789
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

652
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,598
...to do penance
and to amend my life.

653
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,058
Amen.

654
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,664
I chastise my body.

655
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,306
The Holy Grail.

656
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:26,979
A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.

657
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,480
It's nonsense.

658
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,358
You don't believe in God.

659
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,360
No.

660
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:39,658
I don't believe in some magic
from the sky.

661
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,326
Just people.

662
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,580
Sometimes that they can be kind.

663
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:46,707
And that's enough?

664
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,419
Well, I think it has to be.
I think it's all we have.

665
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,591
Are you a God-fearing man,
professor?

666
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,510
I was raised a Catholic.

667
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,763
Well, that's not really an answer.

668
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,559
Professor, are you okay?

669
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,353
Go ahead, open it.

670
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,188
Go on.

671
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,614
A cryptex.

672
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,451
They are used to keep secrets.

673
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:25,370
It's da Vinci's design.

674
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:29,291
You write the information
on a papyrus scroll...

675
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:34,588
...which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

676
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:38,008
If you force it open, the vial breaks...

677
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,886
...vinegar dissolves papyrus...

678
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,223
...and your secret is lost forever.

679
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,643
The only way
to access the information...

680
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,228
...is to spell out the password...

681
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:53,899
...with these five dials,
each with 26 letters.

682
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:58,487
That's 12 million possibilities.

683
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:02,741
I've never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex.

684
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,244
Saunière made one for me once.

685
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,422
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

686
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,260
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

687
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,307
Come on.

688
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,059
Please, you're not all right.

689
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,189
May I try something?

690
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,441
I don't know why it works.

691
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:40,696
My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.

692
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,280
You think?

693
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,157
Yes.

694
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,004
Feeling better, Sophie?

695
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:14,646
My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.

696
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:16,982
I was 4.

697
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,193
I'm sorry.

698
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,488
It was many years ago.

699
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,422
Better?

700
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,134
Yeah.

701
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,094
Okay.

702
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,831
Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box...

703
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,542
...and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.

704
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,045
I don't know what
you're talking about.

705
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,215
All right! Okay!

706
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:24,925
Right now!

707
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,394
Step back!

708
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,734
No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.

709
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,447
Turn around.

710
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,075
Turn around!

711
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,077
You too, mademoiselle.

712
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,184
Sophie!

713
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,019
Get in the truck!

714
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,188
I'll drive! Hurry!

715
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,563
- Better?
- Always, if I got too nervous...

716
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,858
...I had to put my head out
of the window not to be sick.

717
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:08,236
Saunière used to say
I was like a dog.

718
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:13,825
A cute dog. You know, a little dog.

719
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,463
What happened between you
and your grandfather, Sophie?

720
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:32,844
I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.

721
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,638
I need to know.

722
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:38,308
You say he raised you,
but you two don't talk anymore.

723
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,477
You call him by his last name.

724
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:43,313
You say you hate history.

725
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,774
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

726
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,984
So now you're a psychologist too?

727
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,530
What if Saunière had started
to groom you for the Priory?

728
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,491
What do you mean, groom me?

729
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,994
Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child.

730
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:03,041
Say Saunière was hoping one day
you would join him in the Priory.

731
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,335
Still, years later,
when he imagines...

732
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,964
...the Grail is in danger,
he reaches out to you.

733
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:13,218
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?

734
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:16,554
We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

735
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,848
- Real enough to kill for.
- Who?

736
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,607
I'm out of my field here.

737
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:34,739
I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

738
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:38,076
An Englishman,
lives here in France.

739
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,995
Do you trust this man?

740
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,664
I hope you can.

741
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,588
Vernet, André.

742
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,093
It seems you're not a driver at all.

743
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:01,725
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

744
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:09,149
Aiding and abetting
two murder suspects.

745
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:11,693
That carries jail time.

746
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,070
Speak to my lawyer.

747
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:22,746
All this confusion, violence,
vanishing property...

748
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:29,127
It might get around that your bank is
less than ideal, don't you think?

749
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,923
You think you're in pain now,
André Vernet?

750
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,303
My cause is worth your life.
Understand?

751
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:44,267
What do you want?

752
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,814
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.

753
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,492
Please wait.
I'll see if he's available.

754
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,327
It's on the wrong side.

755
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,996
Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.

756
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:08,333
Robert! Do I owe you money?

757
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:12,003
Leigh, my friend...

758
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:15,590
...care to open up
for an old colleague?

759
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,509
- Of course.
- Thank you.

760
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:20,220
But first, a test of honor.

761
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,514
Three questions.

762
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,018
Fire away.

763
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,686
Your first:

764
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:31,523
Shall I serve coffee or tea?

765
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,775
Tea, of course.

766
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,026
Excellent.

767
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,529
Second: Milk or lemon?

768
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,614
Milk?

769
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,284
That would depend on the tea.

770
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,494
Correct.

771
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:49,707
And now the third
and most grave of inquiries:

772
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:55,213
In which year did a Harvard sculler
outrow an Oxford man at Henley?

773
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:06,474
Surely such a travesty
has never occurred.

774
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,977
Your heart is true.

775
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,229
You may pass.

776
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:15,400
Welcome to Château Villette.

777
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:22,949
Leigh Teabing has spent
his entire life...

778
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,994
...studying the Grail.
That thing is one hot tamale.

779
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,579
Sorry?

780
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,874
The cryptex, it's a hot coal.

781
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,085
A hot potato?

782
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:39,924
So you want to keep our chest
close to our cards, yes?

783
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,428
Very close.

784
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:07,285
The truck's signal is coming online.

785
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:08,912
It's about time.

786
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,292
Locked on and tracking, sir.

787
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:20,506
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.

788
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:25,595
Attention! All of Collet's units
to Château Villette.

789
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:29,807
The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.

790
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,659
Aringarosa.

791
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,673
I still don't know why
he put you into this...

792
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,259
...and I'm sorry.

793
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,556
But...

794
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,184
...l'm also very glad.

795
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,122
You are requested
to make yourself at home.

796
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:43,589
Robert!

797
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:47,260
And you travel with a maiden,
it seems.

798
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:50,722
Sir Leigh Teabing,
may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.

799
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:53,057
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

800
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:57,061
It's an honor to welcome you...

801
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,731
...even though it's late.

802
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:03,901
Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.

803
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:08,156
So late, mademoiselle,
it's almost early.

804
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,410
What a lovely smile you have.

805
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,455
Earl Grey?

806
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:17,540
Lemon.

807
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,417
Correct.

808
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,315
Château Villette. Yes.

809
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,156
- No.
- Oh, you must.

810
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:53,117
Remy is from Lyons,
but nevertheless...

811
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:54,786
...he is fantastic with sauces.

812
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:57,163
- Thank you.
- No, I can't.

813
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,087
A dramatic late-night arrival.

814
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,840
Mention of life and death.

815
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:11,511
What can an old cripple
do for you, Robert?

816
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:16,182
We wanna talk about
the Priory of Sion.

817
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,850
The keepers?

818
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:20,144
The secret war?

819
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:22,313
Sorry for all the mystery.

820
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:26,067
Leigh, I'm into something here
that I cannot understand.

821
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:27,610
You?

822
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,823
- Really?
- Not without your help.

823
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:35,326
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

824
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:36,702
Not if it works.

825
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:41,499
There are always four:

826
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,420
The Grand Master
and the three Sénéchaux...

827
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:49,006
...make up the primary
guardians of the Grail.

828
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,718
Thank you, Remy.
That'll be all for now.

829
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:02,854
The Priory's members
span our very globe itself.

830
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:07,483
Philippe de Chérisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.

831
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:09,610
And that is what
they want you to believe.

832
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:13,364
The Priory is charged
with a single task:

833
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:16,868
To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.

834
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:19,579
The source of God's power
on earth.

835
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:21,372
No, that's a common
misunderstanding.

836
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:26,544
The Priory protects the source
of the Church's power on earth:

837
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:28,546
The Holy Grail.

838
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,715
I don't understand.

839
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:35,052
What power? Some magic dishes?

840
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:39,891
Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?

841
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,270
To understand the Holy Grail,
my dear...

842
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,773
...you must first understand
the Holy Bible.

843
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:07,543
The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.

844
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:12,757
The Bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man:

845
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,717
The pagan emperor Constantine.

846
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:17,261
I thought Constantine
was a Christian.

847
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:20,431
Oh, hardly, no.
He was a lifelong pagan...

848
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,267
...who was baptized
on his deathbed.

849
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:26,771
Constantine was Rome's
supreme holy man.

850
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,606
From time immemorial...

851
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:33,277
...his people had worshiped a balance
between nature's male deities...

852
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:36,989
...and the goddess,
or sacred feminine.

853
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:41,327
But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.

854
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:43,871
Three centuries earlier...

855
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,041
...a young Jew named Jesus
had come along...

856
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,544
...preaching love and a single God.

857
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,880
Centuries after his crucifixion...

858
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:56,133
...Christ's followers
had grown exponentially...

859
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:58,886
...and had started a religious war
against the pagans.

860
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:07,353
Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?

861
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,274
Leigh, we can't be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.

862
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:14,402
We can at least agree that the
conflict grew to such proportions...

863
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,154
...that it threatened
to tear Rome in two.

864
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:20,658
So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan...

865
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,660
...but he was also a pragmatist.

866
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:24,996
And in 325 anno Domini...

867
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:30,293
...he decided to unify Rome under
a single religion, Christianity.

868
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:34,672
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.

869
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,134
And to strengthen this new
Christian tradition...

870
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,595
...Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering...

871
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,639
...known as the Council of Nicaea.

872
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:45,308
And at this council...

873
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:50,396
...the many sects of Christianity
debated and voted on, well...

874
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:54,525
...everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels...

875
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,235
...to the date for Easter...

876
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:59,530
...to the administering
of the sacraments, and of course...

877
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,699
...the immortality of Jesus.

878
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,492
I don't follow.

879
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:06,537
Well, ma chère,
until that moment in history...

880
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:11,709
...Jesus was viewed by many of his
followers as a mighty prophet...

881
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:15,755
...as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.

882
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:18,799
A mortal man.

883
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:22,303
Some Christians held
that Jesus was mortal.

884
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,222
Some Christians believed
he was divine.

885
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:26,724
Not the Son of God?

886
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:29,310
Not even his nephew twice removed.

887
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:33,397
Hold on, you're saying
Jesus' divinity came from a vote.

888
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:36,609
Well, remember, in those days,
gods were everywhere.

889
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:41,197
By infusing Jesus the man
with the divine magic...

890
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:44,909
...by making him capable
of earthly miracles...

891
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:49,205
...as well as his own resurrection,
Constantine turned him into a god...

892
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,582
...but within the human world.

893
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:55,169
And he basically knocked the more
distant gods out of the game.

894
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:58,839
Constantine did not create
Jesus' divinity.

895
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:03,010
He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.

896
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,845
- Semantics.
- No, it's not semantics.

897
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:08,057
You're interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.

898
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:13,020
Fact: For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next.

899
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,272
For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.

900
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,942
Absurd. There was a formal
announcement of his promotion.

901
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,111
They couldn't even agree
on the Nicene Creed!

902
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:23,698
Excuse me.
"Who is God, who is man?"

903
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,955
How many have been murdered
over this question?

904
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:34,709
As long as there has been
a one true God...

905
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,086
...there has been killing
in his name.

906
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:48,264
Now let me show you the Grail.

907
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:59,483
This used to be the ballroom.

908
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:01,777
I have little occasion to dance
these days.

909
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,030
I trust you recognize
The Last Supper...

910
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:09,618
...the great fresco by
Leonardo da Vinci.

911
01:19:11,955 --> 01:19:14,623
Now, my dear,
if you would close your eyes.

912
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:17,042
Oh, Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.

913
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:19,587
You asked for my help, I recall.

914
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,423
Allow an old man his indulgences.

915
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:30,139
Now, mademoiselle,
where is Jesus sitting?

916
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,433
- In the middle.
- Good.

917
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,478
He and his disciples
are breaking bread.

918
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:38,063
And what drink?

919
01:19:38,398 --> 01:19:40,316
Wine. They drank wine.

920
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,818
Splendid. And one final question:

921
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:46,030
How many wineglasses
are there on the table?

922
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:49,283
One? The Holy Grail?

923
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,493
Open your eyes.

924
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,122
No single cup.

925
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:56,916
No chalice.

926
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,877
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?

927
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:03,214
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend...

928
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:07,676
...celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

929
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:12,973
Now, Robert,
you could be of help to us.

930
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:17,061
If you'd be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman, please.

931
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:20,981
No balloon animals.
I can make a great duck.

932
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:28,155
This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.

933
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,491
- Quite to the point.
- Yes, indeed.

934
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,743
This is known as the blade.

935
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:34,829
It represents aggression
and manhood.

936
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,790
It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

937
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:42,044
Yes, the more penises you have, the
higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

938
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:46,549
Now, as you would imagine, the
female symbol is its exact opposite.

939
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:48,175
This is called the chalice.

940
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:53,180
And the chalice resembles a cup
or vessel or, more importantly...

941
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,558
...the shape of a woman's womb.

942
01:20:56,726 --> 01:20:59,728
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

943
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:04,900
It is quite literally this ancient
symbol of womanhood.

944
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:11,156
And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful...

945
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:15,661
...that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

946
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,121
Wait, please.

947
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:21,834
You're saying the Holy Grail
is a person? A woman?

948
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:26,672
And it turns out, she makes
an appearance right there.

949
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:28,924
But they are all men.

950
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:30,217
Are they?

951
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,845
What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord...

952
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,764
...seated in the place of honor?

953
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,434
Flowing red hair.

954
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:41,812
Folded feminine hands.

955
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:45,441
Hint of a bosom. No?

956
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,325
It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

957
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:55,993
Who is she?

958
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:59,163
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.

959
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:00,581
The prostitute?

960
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,042
She was no such thing.

961
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:08,047
Smeared by the Church
in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.

962
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:13,302
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.

963
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,311
This is an old wives' tale.

964
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:23,938
The original one, in fact.

965
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:26,231
There's virtually no empirical proof.

966
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:29,610
He knows as well as I do
there's much evidence to support it.

967
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,487
Theories. There are theories.

968
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:34,865
Notice how Jesus and Mary
are clothed.

969
01:22:36,242 --> 01:22:38,327
Mirror images of each other.

970
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,996
The mind sees
what it chooses to see.

971
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:45,626
And venturing into the even more
bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...

972
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:49,338
...appear to be joined at the hip and
are leaning away from each other...

973
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:54,093
...as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them.

974
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:58,430
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

975
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:03,560
Yes. Oh, and Robert,
notice what happens...

976
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:06,897
...when these two figures
change position.

977
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:11,068
Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn't make it true.

978
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:13,153
No. But history...

979
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,364
...she does make it true.

980
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:18,784
Now, listen to this. It's from
the Gospel according to Philip.

981
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:19,994
Philip?

982
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:23,038
Yes, it was rejected
at the Council of Nicaea...

983
01:23:23,206 --> 01:23:25,249
...along with any other gospels
that made...

984
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:27,918
...Jesus appear human
and not divine.

985
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:33,048
"And the companion of the Savior
is Mary Magdalene.

986
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:37,136
Christ loved her more
than all the disciples...

987
01:23:37,303 --> 01:23:39,221
...and used to kiss her on the..."

988
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,265
But this says nothing of marriage.

989
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:44,143
Well, actually...

990
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:45,352
Robert.

991
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:50,649
Actually, in those days, the word
"companion" literally meant "spouse."

992
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:55,279
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

993
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:58,157
- She wrote a gospel?
- She may have.

994
01:23:58,324 --> 01:24:01,285
- Robert, will you fight fair?
- She may have.

995
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:05,456
"And Peter said,
'Did he prefer her to us? '

996
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:07,708
And Levi answered:

997
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:12,004
'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

998
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:16,675
If the Savior made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'

999
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:21,346
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...

1000
01:24:21,514 --> 01:24:25,392
...that it's up to her
to continue his Church.

1001
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:29,188
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

1002
01:24:29,981 --> 01:24:33,817
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

1003
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:38,989
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

1004
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:44,787
Now, my dear, the word
in French for Holy Grail.

1005
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:49,374
From the Middle English
"Sangreal"...

1006
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:52,169
...of the original Arthurian legend.

1007
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:57,508
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?

1008
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:02,679
Sang real, it means "royal blood."

1009
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:07,601
When the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of Christ...

1010
01:25:08,144 --> 01:25:13,482
...it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.

1011
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:17,319
But how could Christ
have a bloodline, unless...?

1012
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:20,322
Mary was pregnant
at the time of the Crucifixion.

1013
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:33,252
For her own safety and for that
of Christ's unborn child...

1014
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:36,547
...she fled the Holy Land
and came to France.

1015
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:41,844
And here, it is said,
she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.

1016
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:45,389
They know the child's name.

1017
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:48,225
- A little girl.
- Yes.

1018
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,519
If that were true,
it's adding insult to injury.

1019
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:51,770
Why?

1020
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:55,607
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

1021
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:57,526
People found God through sex?

1022
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:00,571
In paganism, women were worshiped
as a route to heaven...

1023
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:03,574
...but the modern Church
has a monopoly on that...

1024
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:06,034
...in salvation through Jesus Christ.

1025
01:26:06,202 --> 01:26:08,954
And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.

1026
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:12,332
Women, then, are a huge threat
to the Church.

1027
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,376
The Catholic Inquisition
soon publishes...

1028
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:17,880
...what may be the most
blood-soaked book in human history.

1029
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:20,465
The Malleus Maleficarum.

1030
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,218
The Witches' Hammer.

1031
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:27,264
It instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill...

1032
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,725
...all freethinking women.

1033
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:35,063
In three centuries of witch hunts...

1034
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:39,234
...50,000 women are captured,
burned alive at the stake.

1035
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:42,029
Oh, at least that.
Some say millions.

1036
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:44,364
Imagine, then, Robert...

1037
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:48,744
...that Christ's throne
might live on in a female child.

1038
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:52,748
You asked what would
be worth killing for.

1039
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:56,919
Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.

1040
01:26:57,670 --> 01:26:59,963
This is the secret
that the Priory of Sion...

1041
01:27:00,131 --> 01:27:02,549
...has defended
for over 20 centuries.

1042
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:05,928
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

1043
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:09,932
The keepers of the proof
of our true past.

1044
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:14,603
They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ...

1045
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,981
...and Mary Magdalene.

1046
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:28,992
Sir Leigh?

1047
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:33,121
Sometimes I wonder
who is serving whom.

1048
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,833
His sauces are not that fantastic.

1049
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:40,712
Yes, can I help you?

1050
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,965
Yes. They're on the news now.

1051
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:49,304
Living descendants? Is it possible?

1052
01:27:49,472 --> 01:27:51,139
It's not impossible.

1053
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:55,936
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

1054
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,021
You are wanted for four murders!

1055
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:00,732
That's why Vernet said
"killing spree."

1056
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:04,361
You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.

1057
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:07,030
- That's why he needed you.
- You will leave my house!

1058
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:09,241
- Leigh, listen!
- No, I'm calling the police.

1059
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,785
Jacques Saunière
was her grandfather.

1060
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,290
You're the obsessive Priory scholar.

1061
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:18,709
You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?

1062
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:22,754
I'll bet Jacques Saunière
was on one of those lists.

1063
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:27,217
He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasn't he?

1064
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:30,095
- What?
- I'll bet he was right at the top.

1065
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:35,475
Consider: Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

1066
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:38,937
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other Sénéchaux dead?

1067
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:41,231
What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?

1068
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:45,360
You'd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.

1069
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:47,237
Someone outside the society.

1070
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:52,701
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

1071
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,539
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

1072
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,042
Not really.

1073
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,837
No, that's impossible.

1074
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:08,592
Can that really...?

1075
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:12,304
Is it the keystone?

1076
01:29:15,641 --> 01:29:18,018
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.

1077
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,562
Will you just tell us
what the hell it's for?

1078
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:40,165
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

1079
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:44,503
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

1080
01:29:53,262 --> 01:29:54,429
Yes.

1081
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:57,432
As the legend foretold:

1082
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:01,395
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1083
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:03,230
Oh, my.

1084
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,571
Leigh.

1085
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:16,451
Leigh?

1086
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:18,370
Please.

1087
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:20,580
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

1088
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:25,001
Inside the keystone...

1089
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:27,879
...there'll be a map.

1090
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:30,882
A map that will lead us
to the Holy Grail.

1091
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:37,764
To be trained by
the Grand Master himself.

1092
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:42,060
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?

1093
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:47,482
And he must have sung you
the riddle songs.

1094
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:49,192
I know some of them.

1095
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,328
Can you keep secrets?

1096
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:04,791
Can you know a thing
and never say it again?

1097
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:06,918
And codes?

1098
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:12,215
I imagine they lie down
for you like lovers.

1099
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:20,098
A Sénéchal. A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.

1100
01:31:20,266 --> 01:31:23,185
Tell him, please.
I don't know any of this.

1101
01:31:23,352 --> 01:31:26,229
Leigh, it's not that simple.
She doesn't rem...

1102
01:31:27,773 --> 01:31:29,065
Robert!

1103
01:31:34,363 --> 01:31:35,739
Do not move, woman.

1104
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:41,036
Cripple.

1105
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:45,415
Put the box on the table.

1106
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,876
What, this trifle?

1107
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:52,047
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

1108
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:55,258
Put the keystone on the table.

1109
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:57,886
You will not succeed.

1110
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:03,350
Only the worthy
can unlock the stone.

1111
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:35,131
Rip the gate down.

1112
01:32:38,594 --> 01:32:40,303
Well, well, my dear.

1113
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:45,809
Sit down.

1114
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,435
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1115
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:49,771
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1116
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:52,315
Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.

1117
01:32:52,483 --> 01:32:54,651
Get something
to restrain this monster.

1118
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:01,283
Above the joint.

1119
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:06,705
Fortunately,
a dragon most easy to slay.

1120
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:08,331
He's wearing a cilice.

1121
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:11,334
- A what?
- Well, look.

1122
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:16,298
Inflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.

1123
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:22,554
Not so common these days.

1124
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:24,889
Opus Dei.

1125
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:27,559
Remy, take care of this.

1126
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:33,356
Fache is Opus Dei.

1127
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:37,611
The policeman who's chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.

1128
01:33:37,778 --> 01:33:39,446
Robert.

1129
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:45,035
Well, I must say,
you two are anything but dull.

1130
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:47,370
Leigh?

1131
01:33:49,498 --> 01:33:51,458
You want what's in this box?

1132
01:33:52,543 --> 01:33:54,336
We need a way out of here.

1133
01:33:54,503 --> 01:33:56,546
Well, actually...

1134
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,341
...I do have a plane.

1135
01:34:09,852 --> 01:34:11,728
- Robert! Where do we go?
- Come along.

1136
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:13,730
- In here. Come in.
- Over here.

1137
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:16,399
Get the door. Hurry.

1138
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:20,403
Over here. Over here. Sophie.

1139
01:34:20,571 --> 01:34:21,863
Watch out!

1140
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:25,075
Be careful.

1141
01:34:25,242 --> 01:34:26,910
Come, Rem...

1142
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,377
Shit.

1143
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:39,422
Easy.

1144
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:03,405
Jesus!

1145
01:35:03,572 --> 01:35:04,614
Apropos.

1146
01:35:07,451 --> 01:35:09,327
I can't imagine
what your complaint is.

1147
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:12,539
I'd be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!

1148
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:15,125
Put that away. We might need him.

1149
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:16,876
Better.

1150
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:25,468
Opus Dei.

1151
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:28,972
- What is it?
- A conservative Catholic sect.

1152
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:31,015
Opus Dei is a prelature
to the Vatican.

1153
01:35:31,183 --> 01:35:34,561
You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?

1154
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:36,688
No, no, no. Not the Vatican...

1155
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:39,399
...and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.

1156
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:42,026
And one that has been
going on forever.

1157
01:35:42,194 --> 01:35:44,487
On the one side stands the Priory...

1158
01:35:44,655 --> 01:35:47,323
...and on the other
an ancient group of despots...

1159
01:35:47,491 --> 01:35:49,784
...with members hidden
in high-ranking positions...

1160
01:35:49,952 --> 01:35:51,745
...throughout the Church.

1161
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:56,583
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

1162
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:59,461
And that throughout history,
they seek out and kill...

1163
01:35:59,628 --> 01:36:01,588
...the living descendants
of Jesus Christ.

1164
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:03,465
- That's insane.
- Is it?

1165
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:06,259
How many atrocities and scandals
has the Catholic Church...

1166
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,553
...rationalized in its time?
And what happens...

1167
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:11,514
...if some persuasive scientific
evidence emerges that shows...

1168
01:36:11,682 --> 01:36:14,809
...that the Church's version of Christ
is inaccurate?

1169
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:17,812
What if the world discovers...

1170
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:20,732
...that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie?

1171
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:24,611
The Vatican faces a crisis of faith
unprecedented.

1172
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:27,989
I've got a signal now, sir.
It's ringing.

1173
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:34,871
Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got
tired of the weather here in France...

1174
01:36:35,247 --> 01:36:38,208
...and could you make
the plane ready for...

1175
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:41,336
...Zurich.

1176
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:43,379
Yes. No, we love Zurich.

1177
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:53,890
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

1178
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:57,435
You're the one who lost them.

1179
01:36:57,812 --> 01:36:59,354
You control every step
of this investigation.

1180
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:01,940
You don't let anybody breathe.

1181
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:05,151
You're acting like
you lost your mind.

1182
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:11,407
What is it with these two birds?

1183
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:17,872
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

1184
01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:22,001
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

1185
01:37:49,947 --> 01:37:57,287
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1186
01:37:58,247 --> 01:38:00,081
I am the messenger of God.

1187
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:06,129
Did you kill my grandfather?

1188
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:10,925
I am the messenger...

1189
01:38:11,343 --> 01:38:15,430
Each breath you take is a sin.

1190
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,309
No shadow will be safe again.

1191
01:38:19,476 --> 01:38:24,272
For you will be hunted by angels.

1192
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:27,650
You believe in God?

1193
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:31,446
Your God doesn't
forgive murderers.

1194
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:36,826
He burns them.

1195
01:38:47,963 --> 01:38:49,005
Sophie.

1196
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:31,965
The Teacher will be pleased.

1197
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:34,384
What will you do
once you have the Grail?

1198
01:39:34,551 --> 01:39:35,843
Destroy it.

1199
01:39:36,011 --> 01:39:39,681
The documents and the
sarcophagus, of course.

1200
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:42,392
And the heir?

1201
01:39:46,188 --> 01:39:49,691
Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?

1202
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:51,734
There will be no need.

1203
01:39:51,902 --> 01:39:56,656
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

1204
01:39:56,824 --> 01:39:59,575
There is no way to prove
a living bloodline.

1205
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:01,911
But if you had to...

1206
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:06,582
...would you do as councils
have done before us?

1207
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:16,884
Christ...

1208
01:40:21,765 --> 01:40:26,102
Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.

1209
01:40:29,481 --> 01:40:32,442
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

1210
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:43,578
Robert.

1211
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:47,749
When we land, you must go
straight to your embassy.

1212
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:50,543
Is that so?

1213
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:54,589
Don't you see it?

1214
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:56,507
They never wanted you.

1215
01:40:57,301 --> 01:41:00,053
Maybe even Fache didn't.

1216
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:03,306
It's all about this...

1217
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,183
...idiotic little box.

1218
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:11,981
That's not too flattering.

1219
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:14,984
Crazy old man.

1220
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:17,570
Why leave me with this?

1221
01:41:17,946 --> 01:41:20,573
I should just throw it away.

1222
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:26,662
He trusted you, Sophie.

1223
01:41:27,664 --> 01:41:31,000
A guardian of the Holy Grail.

1224
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:35,004
It sounds so stupid.

1225
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:40,593
It's quite an honor,
if you think about it...

1226
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:42,095
...and take it seriously.

1227
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:45,264
He took it seriously enough
to get himself killed.

1228
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:48,059
Not him. You.

1229
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:53,648
He was the only family I knew.

1230
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:56,442
And maybe I didn't know him at all.

1231
01:41:58,028 --> 01:42:00,029
I'm his marionette, Robert.

1232
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:03,366
Like a girl again,
just with no gift at the end.

1233
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:10,998
But you've done enough.

1234
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:18,381
I don't know why Saunière
picked me to help you, Sophie.

1235
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:24,053
But I won't leave you alone
in all this.

1236
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:31,978
Two marionettes, then.

1237
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:37,984
Maybe this is why he chose you.

1238
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:43,447
Because you will stay.

1239
01:42:58,922 --> 01:43:00,715
I need the flight plan.

1240
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:02,049
Ten minutes.

1241
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:05,386
I asked you to get it for me.

1242
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:08,431
I'm on break.

1243
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:11,475
Come back in 10 minutes.

1244
01:43:13,478 --> 01:43:15,646
My nose! My nose!

1245
01:43:16,231 --> 01:43:17,607
The flight plan, please.

1246
01:43:17,774 --> 01:43:18,816
You asshole!

1247
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,831
It's not "cross."

1248
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:36,375
"Spear"?

1249
01:43:43,342 --> 01:43:44,926
What happened to her?

1250
01:43:45,636 --> 01:43:47,303
No one knows.

1251
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:51,057
Mary Magdalene lived out
her days in hiding.

1252
01:43:52,684 --> 01:43:55,144
And the zealots pursued her still...

1253
01:43:55,687 --> 01:44:00,107
...even in death, trying to destroy
proof of her existence.

1254
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:03,444
But she always had her Knights.

1255
01:44:03,612 --> 01:44:06,072
Brave men sworn to defend her.

1256
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,824
You see, to worship
before her sarcophagus...

1257
01:44:09,326 --> 01:44:12,620
...to kneel before the bones
of Mary Magdalene...

1258
01:44:12,788 --> 01:44:15,957
...was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power...

1259
01:44:16,124 --> 01:44:17,166
...who were oppressed.

1260
01:44:17,542 --> 01:44:22,004
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline...

1261
01:44:22,172 --> 01:44:24,840
...until most believed
her sarcophagus...

1262
01:44:25,842 --> 01:44:27,510
...the Holy Grail...

1263
01:44:28,512 --> 01:44:31,514
...was finally lost in time.

1264
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:43,442
What are you doing?

1265
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:46,279
At the chateau, you said,
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1266
01:44:46,446 --> 01:44:47,863
No, no, no. Do be careful.

1267
01:44:48,031 --> 01:44:51,659
In Latin, Sub roSa.
Literal translation...

1268
01:44:51,827 --> 01:44:53,452
"Beneath the rose."

1269
01:45:06,425 --> 01:45:07,925
We need a mirror.

1270
01:45:08,093 --> 01:45:10,970
Backwards. In the style
of Leonardo himself.

1271
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:12,847
Thank you.

1272
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:21,147
In London lies a knight
a Pope interred

1273
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:25,067
His labor's fruit
a Holy wrath incurred

1274
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:28,404
You seek the orb
that ought be on his tomb

1275
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:32,408
It speaks of Rosy flesh
and seeded womb

1276
01:45:32,576 --> 01:45:36,579
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred"?

1277
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:40,583
A knight whose funeral
was presided over by the Pope.

1278
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,919
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

1279
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:45,129
Templars.

1280
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:48,424
And there's just one place to bury
a Templar knight in London.

1281
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:49,759
Temple Church.

1282
01:45:49,926 --> 01:45:52,094
Temple Church.
If you'll excuse me, my dear...

1283
01:45:52,262 --> 01:45:55,139
...Roger and I must discuss
a change in flight plan.

1284
01:45:55,307 --> 01:45:56,724
Leigh.

1285
01:45:58,435 --> 01:46:00,853
Harboring and transporting
fugitives?

1286
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:04,190
You are already implicated enough.

1287
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:08,986
You and I, Robert,
have observed history.

1288
01:46:09,154 --> 01:46:11,447
Time has been our glass.

1289
01:46:11,948 --> 01:46:15,201
We are in history now. Living it.

1290
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,537
Making it.

1291
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:20,664
"Lmplicated"?

1292
01:46:20,874 --> 01:46:23,459
I am on a Grail quest.

1293
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:26,587
Forgive me, Robert...

1294
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:29,090
...but you two may well
have given this old man...

1295
01:46:29,257 --> 01:46:31,634
...the greatest night of his life.

1296
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,637
Thank you.

1297
01:46:36,681 --> 01:46:38,849
He's going to want more money.

1298
01:46:55,951 --> 01:47:00,079
I suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

1299
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:05,376
I've lost them.
They flew to Switzerland.

1300
01:47:05,627 --> 01:47:07,837
No extradition.

1301
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:16,887
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

1302
01:47:20,976 --> 01:47:24,061
What's going on, Bezu?

1303
01:47:27,065 --> 01:47:29,942
You know that I am Opus Dei?

1304
01:47:30,318 --> 01:47:31,861
Yes.

1305
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:40,703
A bishop of my order called me.

1306
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:43,122
He said a killer
came to him in confession.

1307
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,041
His name was Robert Langdon.

1308
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:50,379
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this man's heart.

1309
01:47:50,547 --> 01:47:53,257
That he would keep killing.

1310
01:47:53,633 --> 01:47:56,093
He said I had to stop him.

1311
01:47:58,138 --> 01:48:01,974
The bishop broke his vows
to tell me this.

1312
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:05,561
He charged me
to stop Robert Langdon.

1313
01:48:08,523 --> 01:48:13,277
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

1314
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:15,905
The bishop?

1315
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,283
God himself?

1316
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:31,045
They've changed their flight plan
to London.

1317
01:48:36,927 --> 01:48:41,430
Go on, Fache.
I'll take care of the controller.

1318
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:46,727
Maybe he needs a few extra euros.

1319
01:48:47,604 --> 01:48:51,357
Just tell me next time.

1320
01:49:15,465 --> 01:49:19,260
I have them, tower. Relay Hawker
to land and hold on tarmac.

1321
01:50:16,526 --> 01:50:18,736
- Secure the area!
- Wider!

1322
01:50:18,903 --> 01:50:21,030
- Armed police!
- You two, round the back!

1323
01:50:21,364 --> 01:50:24,617
Armed police!
Put your hands in the air!

1324
01:50:24,784 --> 01:50:26,744
- Three men up!
- Ready!

1325
01:50:26,911 --> 01:50:29,538
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

1326
01:50:29,706 --> 01:50:32,166
I'm afraid that's
easier said than done in my case.

1327
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:35,544
Oh, good morning.

1328
01:50:35,712 --> 01:50:38,589
Did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me?

1329
01:50:38,757 --> 01:50:41,508
Sir, the French police say
you're transporting fugitives...

1330
01:50:41,676 --> 01:50:43,469
...and you may have
a hostage onboard.

1331
01:50:43,637 --> 01:50:45,220
I'm to take you all into custody.

1332
01:50:45,388 --> 01:50:48,724
Sadly, I have an important medical
appointment which I can't miss.

1333
01:50:48,892 --> 01:50:50,184
I'll fetch the car, sir.

1334
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:53,228
This is serious, sir. The French police
are on their way. Stop!

1335
01:50:53,772 --> 01:50:57,066
Inspector, I can't afford the time
to indulge your games.

1336
01:50:57,233 --> 01:50:58,609
I'm late and I'm leaving.

1337
01:50:58,777 --> 01:51:00,653
If it's so important
for you to stop us...

1338
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:03,072
...then you're just going
to have to shoot us.

1339
01:51:03,573 --> 01:51:05,240
You can start with him.

1340
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:12,247
Search the plane.

1341
01:51:12,415 --> 01:51:13,666
All right.

1342
01:51:25,845 --> 01:51:27,554
I could run them over.

1343
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:34,144
Bad tip.

1344
01:51:36,147 --> 01:51:37,564
Let him go.

1345
01:51:42,028 --> 01:51:44,446
The French cannot be trusted.

1346
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:54,081
Everyone comfy?

1347
01:51:56,459 --> 01:51:57,501
Biscuits?

1348
01:51:58,086 --> 01:51:59,753
They didn't notice anything?

1349
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:04,633
Well, people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes, don't you find?

1350
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:21,275
Do you have the bonds, bishop?

1351
01:52:21,484 --> 01:52:22,735
Yes, I do, Teacher.

1352
01:52:22,902 --> 01:52:26,238
I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.

1353
01:52:26,406 --> 01:52:27,865
I am honored.

1354
01:52:28,116 --> 01:52:32,953
By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.

1355
01:52:35,498 --> 01:52:38,500
- I take it the news is good, then.
- I fly to London.

1356
01:52:38,668 --> 01:52:40,711
The Teacher is waiting for me there.

1357
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:44,506
He has chosen a house of Opus Dei
to make the exchange.

1358
01:52:44,674 --> 01:52:49,094
Mere currency
for the location of the Grail.

1359
01:52:49,262 --> 01:52:51,263
Imagine it.

1360
01:52:57,145 --> 01:53:02,191
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.

1361
01:53:02,358 --> 01:53:05,360
- So should anything go wrong...
- Yes, I know, I know.

1362
01:53:06,488 --> 01:53:08,197
This council does not exist.

1363
01:53:09,157 --> 01:53:10,908
As it never has.

1364
01:53:13,745 --> 01:53:17,539
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

1365
01:53:25,006 --> 01:53:27,007
Keep an eye out for the police.

1366
01:53:40,104 --> 01:53:42,773
I must say, Robert,
I'm quite impressed...

1367
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:46,235
...by the way you withstood
my little aeroplane.

1368
01:53:47,862 --> 01:53:49,404
Did he never tell you?

1369
01:53:49,572 --> 01:53:52,908
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

1370
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:54,743
How old were you?

1371
01:53:54,911 --> 01:53:56,078
Seven.

1372
01:53:58,748 --> 01:54:01,875
Treading water all night long,
screaming his lungs out...

1373
01:54:02,043 --> 01:54:04,086
...to the echoes screaming back.

1374
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:06,755
When they found him,
he was nearly catatonic.

1375
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:08,048
Help!

1376
01:54:09,092 --> 01:54:10,467
It was a long time ago.

1377
01:54:10,635 --> 01:54:12,261
Oh, now, now, Robert.

1378
01:54:12,428 --> 01:54:16,974
You above all people shouldn't be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.

1379
01:54:22,146 --> 01:54:25,482
Temple Church.
I always forget it's right here.

1380
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:31,363
Built 1185 and modern London
just sprang up right around it.

1381
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:38,704
Tell me, why has the Priory kept the
Grail location secret all these years?

1382
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:39,913
I don't know.

1383
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,958
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself...

1384
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:44,918
...which is especially odd...

1385
01:54:45,086 --> 01:54:48,463
...since legend suggests he may not
know his own true identity.

1386
01:54:56,389 --> 01:54:57,431
Hello?

1387
01:54:58,182 --> 01:55:00,851
Why do they make them so scary?

1388
01:55:06,482 --> 01:55:07,608
Oh, it's cold.

1389
01:55:07,775 --> 01:55:11,111
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1390
01:55:20,955 --> 01:55:24,374
So which tomb has an orb?

1391
01:55:40,683 --> 01:55:43,936
Those knights
with their legs crossed...

1392
01:55:44,103 --> 01:55:46,188
...means they'd been
to the Holy Land.

1393
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:49,650
Two wear tunics over their armor...

1394
01:55:49,817 --> 01:55:52,986
...and two have full-length robes.

1395
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:55,781
Two are grasping swords.

1396
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:59,868
And one... Two are praying.

1397
01:56:01,788 --> 01:56:03,789
This one has his arms at his sides.

1398
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:07,668
Oh, and this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.

1399
01:56:07,835 --> 01:56:12,547
I don't see any orb
that ought be on a tomb.

1400
01:56:13,424 --> 01:56:16,218
"Ought be on his tomb."
Are we looking for a missing orb?

1401
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:18,303
Maybe.

1402
01:56:29,065 --> 01:56:30,649
These aren't tombs.

1403
01:56:30,817 --> 01:56:33,235
- What? Yes, of course they are.
- No.

1404
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:35,404
- They're effigies.
- What?

1405
01:56:35,571 --> 01:56:37,656
Not tombs. There's no bodies here.

1406
01:56:37,865 --> 01:56:39,324
This place is wrong.

1407
01:56:41,327 --> 01:56:44,705
Can we go now? We should go.

1408
01:56:47,875 --> 01:56:49,584
Sophie! No!

1409
01:56:51,295 --> 01:56:52,754
Where is the keystone?

1410
01:56:53,881 --> 01:56:55,048
Do not test me!

1411
01:56:55,216 --> 01:56:56,508
- Let her go!
- Don't hurt her.

1412
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:58,760
Give me the keystone! Give it to me!

1413
01:56:58,928 --> 01:57:00,679
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

1414
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:04,516
Just let her go, and you and I can...
We'll come to some agreement.

1415
01:57:05,101 --> 01:57:06,560
Remy.

1416
01:57:09,897 --> 01:57:12,441
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

1417
01:57:13,735 --> 01:57:16,987
Put it away. They're too close
together. You don't have a clear shot.

1418
01:57:17,155 --> 01:57:19,573
- Yes, I do.
- What do you think you're doing?

1419
01:57:21,784 --> 01:57:26,246
Thank you, professor. For a moment,
this was getting complicated.

1420
01:57:26,414 --> 01:57:28,498
Oh, this is absurd.
Oh, for God's sake, man!

1421
01:57:31,794 --> 01:57:33,962
That was satisfying.

1422
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:36,006
I'm glad this bullshit is over.

1423
01:57:39,218 --> 01:57:40,969
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

1424
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:42,429
What?

1425
01:57:47,810 --> 01:57:49,811
Here. You okay?

1426
01:57:55,234 --> 01:57:56,318
Sorry.

1427
01:58:37,276 --> 01:58:39,111
I don't think he's following.

1428
01:58:47,286 --> 01:58:51,206
They won't kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

1429
01:58:53,292 --> 01:58:56,503
- So we have to find it before they do.
- I have to get to a library, fast.

1430
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:06,179
Lieutenant!

1431
01:59:06,347 --> 01:59:07,931
One flag off the prints.

1432
01:59:11,602 --> 01:59:13,770
Remy Legaludec.

1433
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:15,522
Petty theft.

1434
01:59:17,233 --> 01:59:21,027
Skipped out on a hospital bill
for a tracheotomy.

1435
01:59:22,905 --> 01:59:24,739
Peanut allergy.

1436
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:27,576
Like Marie.

1437
01:59:27,743 --> 01:59:29,828
This way. Marie?

1438
01:59:29,996 --> 01:59:32,247
My daughter.

1439
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:34,040
Over here.

1440
01:59:40,715 --> 01:59:41,798
Where?

1441
01:59:41,966 --> 01:59:43,258
Up there.

1442
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,277
What's all that?

1443
02:00:02,445 --> 02:00:04,821
Very advanced surveillance.

1444
02:00:09,535 --> 02:00:10,869
It's a listening post.

1445
02:00:20,296 --> 02:00:22,505
Get me Fache.

1446
02:00:22,673 --> 02:00:27,636
Four of these names are
the men killed last night.

1447
02:00:35,728 --> 02:00:40,690
He once whined to me about the
wasted space of so large a trunk.

1448
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:43,276
Let's see if he complains so now.

1449
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,321
Are you the Teacher?

1450
02:00:49,492 --> 02:00:50,575
I am.

1451
02:00:52,328 --> 02:00:56,873
Superbly done.
You've been of great service.

1452
02:01:00,336 --> 02:01:03,171
The cryptex has yet to be opened.
I can still serve.

1453
02:01:03,339 --> 02:01:05,507
You've done enough.

1454
02:01:08,678 --> 02:01:12,389
We cannot let ego
deter us from our goal.

1455
02:01:13,516 --> 02:01:15,517
I understand.

1456
02:01:16,519 --> 02:01:17,686
Good.

1457
02:01:20,856 --> 02:01:25,694
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

1458
02:01:25,861 --> 02:01:28,071
I will dispose of the old man.

1459
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:30,865
Bless you, Silas.

1460
02:01:32,868 --> 02:01:34,160
Teacher.

1461
02:01:42,336 --> 02:01:44,087
Christ be with you.

1462
02:01:46,799 --> 02:01:51,970
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

1463
02:01:52,221 --> 02:01:54,264
If we're gonna help Leigh,
that's too long.

1464
02:02:05,985 --> 02:02:07,402
Where you going?

1465
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:09,738
Getting you a library card.

1466
02:02:13,326 --> 02:02:15,410
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

1467
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:18,079
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1468
02:02:26,589 --> 02:02:27,922
That's great.

1469
02:02:28,841 --> 02:02:31,092
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

1470
02:02:33,763 --> 02:02:35,096
Thanks.

1471
02:02:35,681 --> 02:02:39,017
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

1472
02:02:39,185 --> 02:02:42,604
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1473
02:02:42,772 --> 02:02:44,606
Compounding keywords:

1474
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:47,650
Knight, Pope, Grail.

1475
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:52,280
Your precious treasure was
almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

1476
02:02:56,660 --> 02:02:58,953
Can you believe how well I did?

1477
02:03:00,498 --> 02:03:02,665
I even convinced the monk.

1478
02:03:03,501 --> 02:03:05,460
I should be in theater.

1479
02:03:12,134 --> 02:03:17,680
A toast to our success, Teacher.
The end of the journey is near.

1480
02:03:20,184 --> 02:03:23,520
Your identity shall go
with me to the grave.

1481
02:03:28,943 --> 02:03:32,570
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.

1482
02:03:32,988 --> 02:03:35,156
See, keywords keep coming up
with the writings...

1483
02:03:35,324 --> 02:03:38,326
...of some bloke named
Alexander Pope.

1484
02:03:38,494 --> 02:03:39,744
"A. Pope."

1485
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:43,123
Your grandfather was a genius.

1486
02:03:48,003 --> 02:03:49,087
Come on.

1487
02:04:23,706 --> 02:04:25,457
Emergency.
Which service do you require?

1488
02:04:25,624 --> 02:04:30,753
I know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

1489
02:04:34,633 --> 02:04:36,759
We've just had a 999 call.

1490
02:04:36,927 --> 02:04:39,304
Triangulation leads back
to Docklands.

1491
02:04:39,472 --> 02:04:41,556
Caller was male.
Claimed your two murderers...

1492
02:04:41,724 --> 02:04:44,392
...are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

1493
02:04:53,486 --> 02:04:57,614
The knight we're looking for
is Sir Isaac Newton.

1494
02:04:59,116 --> 02:05:02,869
His life's work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

1495
02:05:03,329 --> 02:05:05,622
Gravity, for God sakes.

1496
02:05:06,957 --> 02:05:10,084
And if you choose to believe...

1497
02:05:10,252 --> 02:05:14,672
...he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

1498
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:27,852
But if he offended
the Catholic Church...

1499
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:31,814
...the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

1500
02:05:31,982 --> 02:05:34,234
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

1501
02:05:34,401 --> 02:05:37,320
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1502
02:05:37,488 --> 02:05:40,615
Sir Isaac Newton's funeral
was presided over...

1503
02:05:40,783 --> 02:05:44,452
...by his good friend,
his colleague, Alexander Pope.

1504
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:49,082
A. Pope. His first initial.
How did I miss that?

1505
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:50,625
Here.

1506
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:54,128
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.

1507
02:05:55,214 --> 02:05:56,464
An orb.

1508
02:05:56,632 --> 02:06:01,594
Yes. Which one? It's not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing.

1509
02:06:01,762 --> 02:06:05,306
"An orb with Rosy flesh
and seeded womb."

1510
02:06:05,474 --> 02:06:10,103
Solar system. The planets.
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1511
02:06:10,646 --> 02:06:12,814
See, our moon is missing.

1512
02:06:12,982 --> 02:06:15,817
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.

1513
02:06:16,151 --> 02:06:18,736
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

1514
02:06:20,698 --> 02:06:23,658
Robert. These tracks.

1515
02:06:24,493 --> 02:06:26,828
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

1516
02:06:29,873 --> 02:06:31,332
Teabing was here.

1517
02:06:32,668 --> 02:06:33,876
He was alone.

1518
02:06:35,838 --> 02:06:40,008
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did...

1519
02:06:41,093 --> 02:06:43,928
...others might call it God's will.

1520
02:06:44,805 --> 02:06:47,348
I believed that if I had the cryptex...

1521
02:06:47,683 --> 02:06:50,727
...I could solve the riddle alone.

1522
02:06:51,604 --> 02:06:53,104
But I was unworthy.

1523
02:06:53,272 --> 02:06:54,564
But you...

1524
02:06:55,357 --> 02:06:57,859
You have a reason to be here.

1525
02:06:58,027 --> 02:07:01,696
You're the last remaining
guardian of the Grail.

1526
02:07:01,864 --> 02:07:04,032
Your grandfather
and the other Sénéchaux...

1527
02:07:04,199 --> 02:07:06,200
...would not have lied
with dying breath...

1528
02:07:06,368 --> 02:07:09,203
...unless they knew
their secret was preserved.

1529
02:07:11,624 --> 02:07:14,334
How could you know
Saunière's last words?

1530
02:07:14,501 --> 02:07:15,543
Leigh.

1531
02:07:16,712 --> 02:07:19,005
Grail quests require sacrifice.

1532
02:07:19,548 --> 02:07:20,882
You are a murderer.

1533
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:24,135
No. No. Robert, tell her.

1534
02:07:24,303 --> 02:07:28,139
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

1535
02:07:30,225 --> 02:07:32,268
You self-righteous bastard!

1536
02:07:32,436 --> 02:07:33,770
We need to just walk away.

1537
02:07:33,937 --> 02:07:35,772
- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.

1538
02:07:39,068 --> 02:07:40,610
I'll do what I have to now.

1539
02:07:45,949 --> 02:07:47,116
Anything.

1540
02:07:51,246 --> 02:07:52,705
Do you understand?

1541
02:07:54,375 --> 02:07:56,042
So now...

1542
02:07:57,252 --> 02:07:59,337
...can't we all be friends again?

1543
02:08:00,589 --> 02:08:01,923
This way.

1544
02:08:38,127 --> 02:08:41,963
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

1545
02:08:43,799 --> 02:08:45,007
I'm listening now.

1546
02:08:45,634 --> 02:08:47,009
For 2000 years...

1547
02:08:47,636 --> 02:08:51,556
...the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind...

1548
02:08:52,349 --> 02:08:57,311
...crushed passion and idea alike,
all in the name of their walking God.

1549
02:08:57,563 --> 02:09:01,983
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering...

1550
02:09:02,484 --> 02:09:05,403
...drive this church of lies
to its knees.

1551
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:08,656
Armed police!

1552
02:09:08,866 --> 02:09:10,199
Drop your weapon!

1553
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:14,787
Stop, Silas!

1554
02:09:27,593 --> 02:09:30,762
We are betrayed, my son.

1555
02:09:31,346 --> 02:09:33,973
The living heir must be revealed.

1556
02:09:34,433 --> 02:09:36,684
Jesus must be shown
for what he was.

1557
02:09:36,852 --> 02:09:40,104
Not miraculous, simply man.

1558
02:09:41,190 --> 02:09:42,690
I'm sorry.

1559
02:09:44,818 --> 02:09:46,444
Armed police!

1560
02:09:46,779 --> 02:09:49,906
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

1561
02:09:59,333 --> 02:10:01,834
Put it down now! Put it down!

1562
02:10:09,551 --> 02:10:11,594
I am a ghost.

1563
02:10:12,763 --> 02:10:15,389
The dark con can be exposed.

1564
02:10:15,557 --> 02:10:20,895
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

1565
02:10:22,147 --> 02:10:23,731
The three of us.

1566
02:10:41,583 --> 02:10:43,042
How is Silas?

1567
02:10:43,210 --> 02:10:45,586
Is he...? Is he alive?

1568
02:10:45,921 --> 02:10:47,046
The monk?

1569
02:10:50,592 --> 02:10:53,553
Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?

1570
02:10:55,097 --> 02:10:56,806
Get me out of here, Fache.

1571
02:10:57,349 --> 02:10:58,391
Wait.

1572
02:11:01,854 --> 02:11:04,856
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

1573
02:11:05,607 --> 02:11:09,819
One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.

1574
02:11:10,696 --> 02:11:15,700
I cannot be implicated here. There are
still important works to be done.

1575
02:11:17,452 --> 02:11:18,786
You used me.

1576
02:11:20,622 --> 02:11:22,707
God uses us all.

1577
02:11:23,458 --> 02:11:25,042
Help me, Fache.

1578
02:11:26,169 --> 02:11:27,295
Take him.

1579
02:11:31,967 --> 02:11:33,801
- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.

1580
02:11:33,969 --> 02:11:36,053
I'm going to need a trace.

1581
02:11:38,891 --> 02:11:40,725
Your Silas is dead.

1582
02:11:47,816 --> 02:11:49,609
The Priory's sacred charge...

1583
02:11:49,776 --> 02:11:52,820
...was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

1584
02:11:53,822 --> 02:11:58,993
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

1585
02:11:59,161 --> 02:12:03,080
The Priory failed
in their sacred charge.

1586
02:12:03,832 --> 02:12:05,917
So, what choice did I have?

1587
02:12:10,172 --> 02:12:12,006
I sought out the enemy.

1588
02:12:13,425 --> 02:12:17,845
I persuaded them, the Council
of Shadows, that I was an ally.

1589
02:12:18,388 --> 02:12:22,141
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

1590
02:12:22,601 --> 02:12:25,603
Rector, I made them call me.

1591
02:12:26,104 --> 02:12:27,146
"Teacher."

1592
02:12:27,314 --> 02:12:28,606
- Why don't you and l...
- No.

1593
02:12:28,774 --> 02:12:31,400
Robert, no words. On your knees.

1594
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:33,027
Do it.

1595
02:12:33,570 --> 02:12:34,987
No, I mean it. Down.

1596
02:12:36,031 --> 02:12:38,866
Not you. No, my dear, you...

1597
02:12:41,495 --> 02:12:43,955
You're my miracle, Sophie.

1598
02:12:44,539 --> 02:12:46,999
You're the guardian of the Grail.

1599
02:12:47,918 --> 02:12:51,462
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless...

1600
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:54,548
...of those of different skin,
of women.

1601
02:12:54,716 --> 02:12:57,969
You can put an end to all that.

1602
02:12:58,136 --> 02:13:01,889
You must explode the truth
onto the world.

1603
02:13:02,641 --> 02:13:04,141
It's your duty.

1604
02:13:07,062 --> 02:13:09,814
You know the answer to this riddle.

1605
02:13:11,233 --> 02:13:12,775
Open the cryptex...

1606
02:13:14,403 --> 02:13:16,070
...and I'll put down the gun.

1607
02:13:34,256 --> 02:13:36,257
I have no idea how.

1608
02:13:36,425 --> 02:13:38,300
I don't know the code.

1609
02:13:38,468 --> 02:13:41,178
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1610
02:13:46,768 --> 02:13:49,103
Like your grandfather, then.

1611
02:13:49,813 --> 02:13:52,857
Willing to die for your secret.

1612
02:13:53,942 --> 02:13:57,486
But by the way you've been
looking at your hero...

1613
02:13:57,654 --> 02:14:02,450
...I wonder, would you
let him die for you?

1614
02:14:02,784 --> 02:14:05,036
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

1615
02:14:05,203 --> 02:14:07,329
- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.

1616
02:14:07,998 --> 02:14:09,040
I don't know how.

1617
02:14:09,207 --> 02:14:11,125
Open it or he dies.

1618
02:14:11,293 --> 02:14:13,252
- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!

1619
02:14:13,420 --> 02:14:14,754
- Stop it!
- I don't know!

1620
02:14:14,921 --> 02:14:16,297
Stop it!

1621
02:14:21,803 --> 02:14:23,846
She can't do it, Leigh.

1622
02:14:35,859 --> 02:14:37,693
But give me a moment.

1623
02:14:47,829 --> 02:14:49,497
Robert.

1624
02:15:02,636 --> 02:15:03,803
What are you doing?

1625
02:15:04,596 --> 02:15:05,805
Please.

1626
02:16:25,969 --> 02:16:38,731
I'm sorry.

1627
02:16:41,693 --> 02:16:43,152
No!

1628
02:16:51,161 --> 02:16:52,369
No, Robert!

1629
02:16:53,330 --> 02:16:54,622
No!

1630
02:16:55,498 --> 02:16:56,540
No.

1631
02:16:56,958 --> 02:16:59,210
Oh, the map. It's ruined.

1632
02:17:06,635 --> 02:17:08,135
The map is ruined.

1633
02:17:09,012 --> 02:17:10,387
The Grail.

1634
02:17:10,972 --> 02:17:12,139
It's lost.

1635
02:17:12,807 --> 02:17:14,308
The Grail is gone.

1636
02:17:14,643 --> 02:17:17,394
Only the worthy
find the Grail, Leigh.

1637
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:20,064
You taught me that.

1638
02:17:23,568 --> 02:17:24,693
Armed police!

1639
02:17:24,861 --> 02:17:27,238
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

1640
02:17:27,489 --> 02:17:33,994
Put the gun down.

1641
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:41,502
That one. The old man.

1642
02:17:41,670 --> 02:17:42,711
You're under arrest!

1643
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:45,130
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense...

1644
02:17:45,298 --> 02:17:47,216
...if you do not mention,
when questioned...

1645
02:17:47,384 --> 02:17:49,426
...something which you
later rely on in court.

1646
02:17:49,594 --> 02:17:52,263
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1647
02:18:02,941 --> 02:18:05,276
I'll have some questions for you.

1648
02:18:40,645 --> 02:18:43,147
Big crowd out there now.

1649
02:18:43,732 --> 02:18:47,192
Thank you for your statements.
You are free to go, of course.

1650
02:18:56,244 --> 02:18:58,912
I'm sorry. You thought
he was your friend, no?

1651
02:18:59,122 --> 02:19:01,582
It wasn't only us, was it?

1652
02:19:03,209 --> 02:19:04,918
He used you too.

1653
02:19:07,005 --> 02:19:12,760
Leave us, please.

1654
02:19:24,230 --> 02:19:26,815
I should have been smarter.

1655
02:19:26,983 --> 02:19:29,360
I acted on faith, I suppose.

1656
02:19:30,236 --> 02:19:31,612
I'm sorry.

1657
02:19:32,864 --> 02:19:34,490
How many?

1658
02:19:34,657 --> 02:19:37,868
Your grandfather, the other three,
maybe more.

1659
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:43,624
The monk was given to Teabing
as a gift, it seems.

1660
02:19:44,918 --> 02:19:47,127
To do as he asked.

1661
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:50,672
Teabing killed the servant himself,
you know.

1662
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:53,675
- Remy?
- Yes.

1663
02:19:53,843 --> 02:19:54,927
By poison.

1664
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:00,224
How much of it
have you been able to figure out?

1665
02:20:01,267 --> 02:20:05,145
Some. Not enough for it
to make sense.

1666
02:20:06,231 --> 02:20:07,815
It won't ever make sense.

1667
02:20:19,202 --> 02:20:20,411
I'm sorry.

1668
02:20:35,343 --> 02:20:38,429
He forgot everything we've learned.

1669
02:20:39,097 --> 02:20:41,181
Everything we teach.

1670
02:20:44,352 --> 02:20:47,146
It's why we study history.

1671
02:20:47,897 --> 02:20:50,983
So we'll stop killing each other.

1672
02:21:13,047 --> 02:21:16,758
Robert! Robert! Robert!
How could you do it?

1673
02:21:16,926 --> 02:21:19,136
How could you? Robert!

1674
02:21:19,554 --> 02:21:21,889
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1675
02:21:22,223 --> 02:21:25,559
To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

1676
02:21:25,727 --> 02:21:26,977
How could you?

1677
02:21:31,691 --> 02:21:33,650
You couldn't! You solved it.

1678
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:39,573
You took the scroll out
before it broke!

1679
02:21:39,741 --> 02:21:43,744
You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert.
You'll find it. You know what to do.

1680
02:21:43,912 --> 02:21:46,205
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her...

1681
02:21:46,372 --> 02:21:48,415
...and you'll set her free
upon the world!

1682
02:21:48,583 --> 02:21:52,044
That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!

1683
02:22:02,514 --> 02:22:07,434
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one:

1684
02:22:08,353 --> 02:22:12,564
The orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired Newton's life's work.

1685
02:22:12,732 --> 02:22:17,611
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

1686
02:22:20,865 --> 02:22:22,366
A-P-P-L-E.

1687
02:22:23,451 --> 02:22:24,743
Apple.

1688
02:22:39,259 --> 02:22:42,261
The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits

1689
02:22:42,428 --> 02:22:44,805
The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates

1690
02:22:44,973 --> 02:22:47,099
Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies

1691
02:22:47,267 --> 02:22:51,144
She rests at last
beneath the starry skies

1692
02:22:52,772 --> 02:22:54,731
I think I know where she's gone.

1693
02:22:55,608 --> 02:22:58,151
I think the Grail has gone home.

1694
02:23:18,006 --> 02:23:22,843
Built by the Templars themselves.
Named for the original Rose Line.

1695
02:23:23,011 --> 02:23:24,928
Rosslyn Chapel.

1696
02:23:26,014 --> 02:23:27,848
So this is it.

1697
02:23:28,808 --> 02:23:30,684
The gift at the end.

1698
02:23:31,644 --> 02:23:35,397
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits."

1699
02:23:36,316 --> 02:23:39,568
You never told me the joke
Saunière made of you.

1700
02:23:39,819 --> 02:23:41,153
What was it?

1701
02:23:41,654 --> 02:23:43,572
He called me a flatfoot.

1702
02:23:43,865 --> 02:23:46,158
A beat cop of history.

1703
02:23:46,868 --> 02:23:48,952
Oh, a dumb policeman...

1704
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:52,539
...who just does his job
day after day, of history.

1705
02:23:52,707 --> 02:23:56,543
You know, his father was one.
A policeman.

1706
02:23:57,128 --> 02:24:01,882
Saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

1707
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:08,430
We are who we protect, I think.

1708
02:24:09,349 --> 02:24:11,099
What we stand up for.

1709
02:24:22,987 --> 02:24:24,404
Jewish...

1710
02:24:25,490 --> 02:24:28,241
...Christian, Egyptian...

1711
02:24:29,535 --> 02:24:31,953
...Masonic, pagan...

1712
02:24:32,997 --> 02:24:34,748
...Templar crosses...

1713
02:24:35,333 --> 02:24:36,750
...pyramids.

1714
02:24:44,467 --> 02:24:48,261
I think I've been here before.

1715
02:24:48,429 --> 02:24:49,596
Sophie.

1716
02:25:09,450 --> 02:25:11,201
A very long time ago.

1717
02:25:13,538 --> 02:25:15,330
Come along, Sophie.

1718
02:25:30,555 --> 02:25:31,638
Sophie.

1719
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:33,807
Over here.

1720
02:25:41,524 --> 02:25:45,152
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates."

1721
02:25:45,486 --> 02:25:47,988
Pagan symbols for
male and female.

1722
02:25:49,949 --> 02:25:51,742
Fused as one.

1723
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:54,286
As the pagans would have wanted.

1724
02:25:55,872 --> 02:25:57,622
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

1725
02:26:03,838 --> 02:26:06,214
We're just gonna be a moment.

1726
02:26:55,389 --> 02:26:56,723
Robert.

1727
02:27:29,924 --> 02:27:31,758
I've never seen that before.

1728
02:27:36,973 --> 02:27:39,349
The style is...

1729
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:42,435
It's unmistakable.

1730
02:27:51,654 --> 02:27:53,947
These could have been painted by
Leonardo da Vinci.

1731
02:27:56,075 --> 02:27:59,202
"Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies."

1732
02:27:59,745 --> 02:28:05,584
"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies."

1733
02:28:24,312 --> 02:28:26,062
The fleur-de-lis.

1734
02:29:17,114 --> 02:29:18,156
She was here.

1735
02:29:21,202 --> 02:29:22,827
Her sarcophagus.

1736
02:29:24,914 --> 02:29:26,539
Mary Magdalene.

1737
02:29:28,209 --> 02:29:30,293
The Holy Grail herself.

1738
02:29:31,837 --> 02:29:33,380
She was here.

1739
02:29:40,596 --> 02:29:44,808
With modern DNA testing,
those bones...

1740
02:29:44,976 --> 02:29:48,520
...could have shown definitive proof
of a bloodline.

1741
02:29:50,690 --> 02:29:52,357
Where did she go?

1742
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:55,735
Did the Church finally get her?

1743
02:30:10,292 --> 02:30:12,877
This is incredible. Look at this.

1744
02:30:13,045 --> 02:30:16,381
Look at this. These records
go back thousands of years.

1745
02:30:17,591 --> 02:30:20,468
They date back
to the death of Christ.

1746
02:30:22,763 --> 02:30:26,141
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

1747
02:30:48,164 --> 02:30:52,459
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

1748
02:30:53,461 --> 02:30:56,171
How was I ever supposed
to figure all this out?

1749
02:30:56,589 --> 02:30:59,007
When you and your
grandfather fought...

1750
02:30:59,175 --> 02:31:01,926
...was it something about your past?

1751
02:31:03,721 --> 02:31:05,513
How could you know that?

1752
02:31:06,182 --> 02:31:08,975
About how your parents died?

1753
02:31:09,935 --> 02:31:11,644
Sophie?

1754
02:31:13,856 --> 02:31:16,149
It was during primary school.

1755
02:31:17,693 --> 02:31:19,736
I was in his library.

1756
02:31:21,489 --> 02:31:23,031
Doing research.

1757
02:31:23,199 --> 02:31:25,867
I was trying to find out
about my family.

1758
02:31:26,035 --> 02:31:28,328
Sophie, where are you, princess?

1759
02:31:29,121 --> 02:31:31,456
I wanted to know about them.

1760
02:31:32,124 --> 02:31:34,167
But I couldn't find any records.

1761
02:31:35,294 --> 02:31:37,212
Not of their death...

1762
02:31:38,672 --> 02:31:40,548
...not of the accident.

1763
02:31:41,175 --> 02:31:43,551
I'd asked him for as long
as I could remember...

1764
02:31:43,719 --> 02:31:45,053
...but he would never tell me.

1765
02:31:45,221 --> 02:31:46,930
I told you, no.

1766
02:31:49,350 --> 02:31:50,850
But why can't I?

1767
02:31:51,185 --> 02:31:53,019
He stood over me...

1768
02:31:54,730 --> 02:31:56,815
...and he wouldn't let me leave.

1769
02:31:56,982 --> 02:31:58,817
They're dead. Dead and buried.

1770
02:31:59,318 --> 02:32:00,985
Never look for them, Sophie.

1771
02:32:01,237 --> 02:32:02,445
Promise me.

1772
02:32:03,906 --> 02:32:05,031
Swear it!

1773
02:32:05,741 --> 02:32:06,866
Swear it to me!

1774
02:32:17,545 --> 02:32:19,546
I kept my promise.

1775
02:32:23,134 --> 02:32:25,969
The next week he sent me
to boarding school.

1776
02:32:27,638 --> 02:32:31,057
One weekend
I came home unexpectedly.

1777
02:32:32,143 --> 02:32:34,978
And what I saw
my grandfather doing...

1778
02:32:35,896 --> 02:32:37,564
Some ritual.

1779
02:32:39,567 --> 02:32:41,151
I was so frightened.

1780
02:32:45,823 --> 02:32:48,032
We hardly ever spoke again.

1781
02:32:51,745 --> 02:32:56,791
Do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the accident?

1782
02:32:57,835 --> 02:33:00,086
Before your parents were killed?

1783
02:33:00,754 --> 02:33:03,339
Yeah. No. I don't know.

1784
02:33:04,466 --> 02:33:05,592
Why?

1785
02:33:08,345 --> 02:33:10,722
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

1786
02:33:30,201 --> 02:33:32,202
These are my parents.

1787
02:33:34,330 --> 02:33:35,705
My brother.

1788
02:33:37,374 --> 02:33:39,167
And this is you, isn't it?

1789
02:33:44,131 --> 02:33:47,842
The paper says
the entire family was killed.

1790
02:33:48,302 --> 02:33:52,180
The mother, the father, the boy, 6...

1791
02:33:53,974 --> 02:33:56,309
...and the girl, 4.

1792
02:33:57,895 --> 02:34:02,482
But your name was never Saunière.
It's Saint-Clair.

1793
02:34:05,903 --> 02:34:08,238
It's one of the oldest families
in France.

1794
02:34:08,906 --> 02:34:12,659
It's from a line of the
Merovingian kings.

1795
02:34:21,252 --> 02:34:23,086
Royal blood.

1796
02:34:25,089 --> 02:34:26,714
I was so wrong.

1797
02:34:28,342 --> 02:34:32,637
Saunière didn't want you to help guard
the secret of the Holy Grail.

1798
02:34:34,348 --> 02:34:35,682
Sophie...

1799
02:34:38,185 --> 02:34:40,353
...you are the secret.

1800
02:34:41,689 --> 02:34:44,190
You survived the accident.

1801
02:34:44,441 --> 02:34:47,110
If it even was an accident.

1802
02:34:47,278 --> 02:34:49,237
The Priory found out.

1803
02:34:49,863 --> 02:34:53,032
Somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive.

1804
02:34:53,617 --> 02:34:56,953
They hid you with the
Grand Master himself...

1805
02:34:57,454 --> 02:34:59,664
...who raised you as his own.

1806
02:35:00,708 --> 02:35:02,542
According to all of this...

1807
02:35:04,044 --> 02:35:05,712
...Princess Sophie...

1808
02:35:09,425 --> 02:35:10,925
...you are the heir.

1809
02:35:13,220 --> 02:35:15,138
The end of the bloodline.

1810
02:35:16,765 --> 02:35:20,059
You are the last living descendent...

1811
02:35:21,228 --> 02:35:23,104
...of Jesus Christ.

1812
02:36:08,525 --> 02:36:09,901
What is this?

1813
02:36:11,945 --> 02:36:13,196
Sophie?

1814
02:36:16,367 --> 02:36:17,492
Who are you?

1815
02:36:17,659 --> 02:36:20,161
There have been many names.

1816
02:36:20,662 --> 02:36:22,497
The keepers.

1817
02:36:23,332 --> 02:36:24,832
Guardians.

1818
02:36:25,209 --> 02:36:27,502
The Priory of Sion.

1819
02:36:27,836 --> 02:36:33,174
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you:

1820
02:36:33,634 --> 02:36:35,259
Jacques Saunière.

1821
02:36:37,638 --> 02:36:42,975
He would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much.

1822
02:36:43,894 --> 02:36:47,897
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now...

1823
02:36:48,065 --> 02:36:51,275
...as they have always
protected our family.

1824
02:36:53,821 --> 02:36:55,947
I gave you up once...

1825
02:36:56,698 --> 02:36:59,784
...knowing I might
never see you again.

1826
02:37:03,205 --> 02:37:05,164
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

1827
02:37:06,333 --> 02:37:11,671
I have prayed for this moment
for a very long time.

1828
02:37:13,340 --> 02:37:15,508
Welcome home, child.

1829
02:37:39,533 --> 02:37:40,616
Hey.

1830
02:37:43,078 --> 02:37:44,704
No more strings.

1831
02:37:49,209 --> 02:37:52,628
His last breath to keep me safe.

1832
02:37:56,925 --> 02:38:01,179
She has some things
she wants to tell me.

1833
02:38:01,930 --> 02:38:04,348
About my family.

1834
02:38:10,689 --> 02:38:11,856
What will you do?

1835
02:38:12,941 --> 02:38:16,736
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

1836
02:38:17,488 --> 02:38:19,947
They just got the pronoun wrong.

1837
02:38:23,243 --> 02:38:24,994
She said when Saunière died...

1838
02:38:25,162 --> 02:38:28,956
...he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.

1839
02:38:29,124 --> 02:38:33,085
So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.

1840
02:38:35,255 --> 02:38:37,215
What would you do, Robert?

1841
02:38:38,133 --> 02:38:42,428
Okay, maybe there is no proof.
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

1842
02:38:42,596 --> 02:38:46,849
But, Sophie, the only thing that
matters is what you believe.

1843
02:38:47,809 --> 02:38:50,895
History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man...

1844
02:38:51,063 --> 02:38:53,064
...a human inspiration. That's it.

1845
02:38:53,857 --> 02:38:56,609
That's all the evidence
has ever proved.

1846
02:38:58,111 --> 02:38:59,237
But...

1847
02:39:00,155 --> 02:39:02,073
...when I was a boy...

1848
02:39:04,451 --> 02:39:08,955
When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about...

1849
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:14,293
...I thought I was going to die,
Sophie.

1850
02:39:16,255 --> 02:39:17,713
What I did...

1851
02:39:18,423 --> 02:39:19,799
...I prayed.

1852
02:39:21,301 --> 02:39:25,429
I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive...

1853
02:39:25,597 --> 02:39:27,348
...so I could see my parents again...

1854
02:39:27,516 --> 02:39:30,142
...so I could go to school again...

1855
02:39:30,519 --> 02:39:32,812
...so I could play with my dog.

1856
02:39:34,189 --> 02:39:37,525
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't alone down there.

1857
02:39:39,403 --> 02:39:42,154
Why does it have to be
human or divine?

1858
02:39:42,322 --> 02:39:44,282
Maybe human is divine.

1859
02:39:45,534 --> 02:39:47,410
Why couldn't Jesus
have been a father...

1860
02:39:47,578 --> 02:39:50,413
...and still been capable
of all those miracles?

1861
02:39:50,831 --> 02:39:53,374
Like turning water into wine?

1862
02:39:53,750 --> 02:39:57,378
Well, who knows?
His blood is your blood.

1863
02:39:57,546 --> 02:40:00,715
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

1864
02:40:01,300 --> 02:40:04,343
Maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands.

1865
02:40:04,511 --> 02:40:07,680
And maybe you're
a knight on a Grail quest.

1866
02:40:10,350 --> 02:40:13,102
Well, here's the question:

1867
02:40:13,854 --> 02:40:16,564
A living descendent
of Jesus Christ...

1868
02:40:18,066 --> 02:40:20,651
...would she destroy faith?

1869
02:40:21,153 --> 02:40:24,864
Or would she renew it?

1870
02:40:26,658 --> 02:40:29,952
So again I say, what matters
is what you believe.

1871
02:40:32,164 --> 02:40:33,497
Thank you.

1872
02:40:35,584 --> 02:40:36,876
For bringing me here.

1873
02:40:39,046 --> 02:40:41,547
For letting him choose you...

1874
02:40:42,215 --> 02:40:43,466
...Sir Robert.

1875
02:40:53,685 --> 02:40:54,727
You take care.

1876
02:40:56,271 --> 02:40:57,438
Yes.

1877
02:41:22,089 --> 02:41:23,255
Hey.

1878
02:41:36,186 --> 02:41:37,228
Nope.

1879
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:40,773
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

1880
02:41:44,277 --> 02:41:45,695
Godspeed.

1881
02:42:44,421 --> 02:42:45,755
Bloodline.

1882
02:42:49,259 --> 02:42:50,676
Rose Line.

1883
02:42:57,392 --> 02:42:59,268
"Hides beneath the Rose."

1884
02:44:58,013 --> 02:45:01,640
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits.

1885
02:45:04,686 --> 02:45:08,147
Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies.

1886
02:45:24,164 --> 02:45:27,833
The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates.

1887
02:46:07,290 --> 02:46:07,293
She rests at last
beneath starry skies."

1888
02:46:40,290 --> 02:47:05,293
