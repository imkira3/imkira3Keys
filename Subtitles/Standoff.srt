I understand the, uh, unfortunate

165
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:47,898
and, uh, complex moral dilemma

166
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,735
<i>that you're facing here.
But it's real simple.</i>

167
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:53,937
The little lady's seen my face.

168
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:58,009
<i>Now she's got to pay the
price like everybody else.</i>

169
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:00,780
That's how it works.

170
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:05,518
As far as you should be
concerned, she's already dead.

171
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:10,053
Now, the sooner you allow me

172
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:12,657
to prove that little point to you,

173
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:13,890
the sooner you can get back

174
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:16,661
to your perfect little life here.

175
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:19,900
- ( groans )
- <i>Now, I know you're bleeding up there.</i>

176
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:23,768
And that does make time a factor,

177
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,470
so here's what you're gonna do...

178
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:28,840
you're gonna send the girl down to me.

179
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:31,642
Get yourself down to a
hospital. Get yourself fixed up.

180
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:33,543
I'm gonna take care of my
business and that'll be that.

181
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:34,547
What do you say?

182
00:16:36,683 --> 00:16:38,383
<i>Believe me when I tell you, son,</i>

183
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:40,851
you do not want to fight me on this thing.

184
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:44,122
This will only devolve
into a battle of wills

185
00:16:44,124 --> 00:16:46,727
and my will is stronger than
anyone you have ever met.

186
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:51,162
( sighs )

187
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:52,433
Yeah?

188
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:57,501
Well, you and me ain't never
been introduced, asshole.

189
00:16:57,503 --> 00:17:00,637
My name's Carter Greene. This is my house.

190
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,809
Now, so long as I'm still breathing,

191
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:08,078
you ain't gonna harm a
hair on this child's head.

192
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,448
Listen, you just send the
little lady down here right now.

193
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,682
This is not the time to play hero,

194
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:15,853
and I am the last individual
on God's green earth

195
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:17,888
that you wanna butt
heads with, you hear me?

196
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,990
Oh, yeah, I hear ya.

197
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:22,862
I hear ya and you sound real scary.

198
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:26,763
Fuck you, Farmer Jim!

199
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:29,800
You're all alone out here on the frontier.

200
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:31,669
No friends, no family,

201
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:34,172
<i>no cops, no help at all.</i>

202
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:36,574
This is the Wild West, son.

203
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:39,042
The Wild fucking West.

204
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:42,480
There ain't no gods coming
out here to save your ass.

205
00:17:42,482 --> 00:17:46,217
It's just you and me and a murder of crows

206
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:48,853
waiting to pick over our dead bones.

207
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:51,756
<i>So you take a breather.</i>

208
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:54,491
You let that sink in.

209
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:58,462
But don't take too long, ya hear?

210
00:17:58,464 --> 00:17:59,696
You don't wanna get too much blood

211
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:02,168
all over your white trash fineries.

212
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:10,942
I need your help.

213
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:13,009
I want you to go in the
bathroom and get a first aid kit.

214
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:14,647
It's under the sink. Go.

215
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:30,228
Come to papa.

216
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,096
Okay, set it down.

217
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:34,701
Open it up. Come here.

218
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:38,672
You're gonna help me, okay?

219
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:43,774
Carter: <i>Pour this on.</i>

220
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:46,847
Okay. ( groans )

221
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:52,149
( panting, groaning )

222
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:55,952
- ( screams )
- Get it real hot, okay?

223
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:58,058
<i>Just hold it on there.</i>

224
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,096
All right, slowly put it down.

225
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:06,700
Don't look.

226
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:12,772
- ( Carter screams )
- ( Sade screams )

227
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:19,213
Carter: More.

228
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:23,180
More, more, more. Come on.

229
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:25,486
There.

230
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:32,826
You're supposed to swallow them.

231
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:40,631
Not when you hurt as bad as I do.

232
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:43,768
Go... go in the other room.

233
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,938
In a box there are some light bulbs, okay?

234
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,638
Bring me all of them.

235
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,609
And some water. Bring me some water.

236
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:54,848
<i>( footsteps creaking )</i>

237
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:06,760
I said all of them. Go.

238
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,968
And towels, bring me some towels.

239
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,740
The bathroom, go. Go.

240
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:26,613
Please.

241
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,028
Good.

242
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,045
<i>( glass shatters )</i>

243
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:15,326
That ain't no farmer.

244
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:17,694
Now even if we're not here,

245
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,196
- we'll hear him if he tries going up the stairs.
- Cool.

246
00:21:20,198 --> 00:21:22,732
What's the water for?

247
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:25,038
It's for drinking.

248
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:28,942
Oh.

249
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:32,311
Want some?

250
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:36,916
<i>( creaking )</i>

<i>( clatters )</i>

252
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:53,297
- So, what's your name?
- Isabelle.

253
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:56,200
But everyone calls me Bird.
I don't like it, though.

254
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:57,934
Bird?

255
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:00,971
How'd you get a colorful name like that?

256
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:03,007
My dad gave it to me.

257
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:05,843
My mom said he started
calling me his little bird

258
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:08,315
when I was real small
'cause I never wanted to eat.

259
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:11,717
He died, though.

260
00:22:13,118 --> 00:22:14,919
They both did.

261
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:19,226
- Car crash.
- <i>( clattering )</i>

262
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:22,995
God, I'm...

263

( exhales ) I'm sorry.

264
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:32,903
How'd you get in this mess, anyway?

265
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:34,939
He shot Roger at the cemetery.

266
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:37,807
- Roger?
- Aunt Jane's boyfriend.

267
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:39,943
( exhales )

268
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:43,213
Jesus. I'm sorry.

269
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:45,816
You apologize a lot

270
00:22:45,818 --> 00:22:47,953
for someone who didn't do anything wrong.

271
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:52,056
I know. I... I just meant

272
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:54,157
you know, it's too bad your uncle's dead.

273
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,060
He wasn't my uncle.

274
00:22:57,062 --> 00:23:00,232
But I should've been nicer to him.

275
00:23:18,283 --> 00:23:20,286
- ( exhales )
- <i>( clattering )</i>

276
00:23:44,443 --> 00:23:46,879
He's a monster.

277
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,981
He's no monster. Hey.

278
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:54,884
Don't give him the satisfaction.

279
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:56,487
He's no monster.

280
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:59,192
Yes, he is.

281
00:24:03,061 --> 00:24:04,428
You're all alone?

282
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,430
This big company just moved in

283
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:08,566
and this whole valley's a graveyard.

284
00:24:08,568 --> 00:24:12,138
The crops are alive,
but the houses are dead.

285
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,343
There's nobody here but scarecrows.

286
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:19,112
And you.

287
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,415
And me.

288
00:24:26,918 --> 00:24:29,953
- <i>( ball bounces )</i>
- How many bullets do you have?

289
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:31,891
Just the one.

290
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:35,124
That's it?

291
00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:38,162
<i>You don't have any more
packed in a box or something?</i>

292
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:40,064
I'm afraid not.

293
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,465
Last shell in the house.

294
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,902
Don't worry, though.

295
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:47,273
He doesn't know that.

296
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:50,441
Can we go out a window?

297
00:24:50,443 --> 00:24:54,010
No. I mean, I'd never
make it with this leg.

298
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:55,645
You could climb out on your own.

299
00:24:55,647 --> 00:24:58,449
But then I wouldn't be
there to protect you,

300
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:00,017
and that's just what he wants.

301

<i>No, we're stuck here

302
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:04,989
<i>or he leaves.</i>

Thank you.

305
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,195
No, don't mention it, Isabelle.

306
00:25:12,197 --> 00:25:14,533
Just... just doing what's right.

307
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:17,604
Call me Bird if you want.

308
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:21,107
I thought you didn't like that name.

309
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:25,212
Depends on who's using it.

310
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:31,147
Well, pleased to meet you, Bird.

311
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:33,853
I'm Carter, in case you missed it.

313
00:25:45,196 --> 00:25:47,064
It's a nice camera you got there.

314
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:49,935
What, are you taking pictures
of the cemetery or something?

315
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:55,638
Him. I got a picture of
him without his mask on.

316
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,174
- Does he know that?
- I think so.

317
00:25:58,176 --> 00:26:00,512
Well, that's great. Give me the film.

318
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:09,586
Sade: <i>Hey, tough guy!</i>

319
00:26:09,588 --> 00:26:11,622
<i>I was wondering.</i>

00:26:11,624 --> 00:26:13,159
<i>Let me ask you.</i>

321
00:26:16,995 --> 00:26:19,028
What's with all the boxes, huh?

322
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,533

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,278
So, hey, man,

327
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,082
what happened to your family, huh?

328
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:40,487
What, they up and leave your sorry ass?

<i>Is this a broken
home I'm sitting in?</i>

Come on, badass, talk to me!

331
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:50,326
Don't be shy!

332

Shit, you can confide in me.

Whoa, whoa! Lookie here.

334
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:59,470
Soldier boy.

335
00:26:59,472 --> 00:27:02,205
You're a soldier boy.

336
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:04,674
Damn good one from the
looks of this photograph.

337
00:27:04,676 --> 00:27:07,144
Look at you, all spit and polish

338
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:09,413

and your pretty ribbons.

<i>Huh?</i>

341

Hey, look, I'm ex-military, too, man.

342
00:27:14,787 --> 00:27:17,520
Black ops, you know, real
jackal shit. Where were you?

343
00:27:17,522 --> 00:27:20,423
Iraq? No, no, no.

Afghanistan.

00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:24,260
Hey, Sar. Greene!

346

Nice-looking woman you had there, boy.

Oh, come on, Sar. Greene!

357

I'm just fucking with you a little bit.

358
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,064
Ah!

359

Ain't no need for you to get

Took the liberty of dipping
into your little reserve.

364

<i>I understand where you're
coming from with all this, man.</i>

00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:27,657
I understand. I got a little girl myself.

371
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,259
She ain't but... well,
she can't be no older

372
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:32,162
than the little lady up there

373
00:28:32,164 --> 00:28:35,432
and she means the world to me.

374
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:38,201
Uh, nothing I wouldn't
do for that little girl.

375
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:39,670
I mean, that's why I'm
in this line of work.

376
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:41,538
You know, I got a family that depends on me

377

and I can't let one little
loose end with a ponytail

responsibilities either.

Right? I mean, what's more important,

382

the life of a stranger or...

I already lost.

<i>God damn, Sergeant Greene.</i>

487
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:24,200
That sure is a whole lot of apologies.

488
00:36:24,202 --> 00:36:27,102
Exactly how many kids did you get killed?

489

<i>( Sade laughing )</i>

490

Don't look at me.

00:36:36,682 --> 00:36:38,584
Don't look at me!

492
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:43,587
Well, now I know why you
had that cannon so handy.

493
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:45,988
You packed the place up,

494
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,792
got drunk,

495
00:36:48,794 --> 00:36:50,759
then you stopped and thought about it.

496
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:54,663
<i>Decided that life wasn't
worth living anymore, was it?</i>

Well, hell...

...don't let this little
fiasco with the kid

ruin your whole afternoon.

500
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:03,772
By all means, go ahead!

501
00:37:03,774 --> 00:37:05,341
Act like the two of us ain't even here

502
00:37:05,343 --> 00:37:08,713

Oh, but, no, seriously, man,

505
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:18,721
I know where you're coming from, though.

506
00:37:18,723 --> 00:37:21,156
I do.

507
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:23,628
<i>Shit, she ain't your kid.</i>

508
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:26,830
Can't turn back time.

509
00:37:26,832 --> 00:37:27,800
Believe me, I done tried.

Even Tombstone courage runs out.

512
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:39,278
You need to go ahead on
and give in to the beast.

513
00:37:41,213 --> 00:37:43,649
Send the little lady down here to me.

Bird: <i>I'm sorry.</i>

522
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,930
No, don't be sorry. I...

523
00:38:33,932 --> 00:38:36,334
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

524
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:48,747
What was your son's name?

525
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:53,019
Sam.

526
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:56,055
You miss him?

527
00:38:58,756 --> 00:39:00,290
Every day.

528
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:02,694
I miss my parents, too.

What?

"There ain't no quitting me."

532
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:15,240
Just something my dad used to say.

533
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:20,879
It always made me feel safe.

534
00:39:24,515 --> 00:39:27,183
You think I'll see him when I die?

535

Hey, don't talk like that, okay?

536
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:32,321
Help will be here soon.

537
00:39:32,323 --> 00:39:36,095
Don't say that, Carter. I'm not stupid.

538
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,229
All right.

539
00:39:40,231 --> 00:39:42,867
Maybe help ain't coming.

But I can promise you this...

You believe me?

546
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:10,995
Why'd your wife leave?

<i>you loose sack of shit!</i>

Hey, don't worry, though.

581
00:41:59,203 --> 00:42:01,069
I'll let your daughter know you died

Out-fucking-standing.

You beat me at my own game.

You're a master of psychological warfare!

Next thing you know,

588
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:16,919
you'll have me tidying up the place

589

How big?

602
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:00,330
It's big.

603
00:43:00,332 --> 00:43:02,732
There's a generator in the basement

604
00:43:02,734 --> 00:43:04,334
that runs the whole power, you see?

605
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:06,171
I haven't filled it up in days.

606
00:43:07,472 --> 00:43:09,504
It's running on fumes.

607
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:12,008
I don't understand.

608
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:13,977
It'll be night soon, Bird.

609
00:43:13,979 --> 00:43:16,345
Without any power, the whole

Not with one shot.

613
00:43:21,752 --> 00:43:23,521
What does that mean?

614
00:43:26,256 --> 00:43:28,390
It means I gotta get you out of here

615
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:30,727
while it's still light out.

616
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:33,363
But your leg.

617
00:43:33,365 --> 00:43:36,332
I'm not going with you.

618
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:39,067
I'm gonna help you climb out a
window so you can run for help.

619
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:41,537
- But you said that's what he wants!
- I know what I said, Bird,

620
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:43,006
but things are different now, okay?

621
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:44,774
You gotta trust me on this.

622
00:43:44,776 --> 00:43:47,576
This is your best chance.

623
00:43:47,578 --> 00:43:49,981
<i>Okay?</i>

624
00:43:59,024 --> 00:44:00,960
Oh, fuck.

625
00:44:08,265 --> 00:44:10,165
Hey, is the, uh,

626
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:12,734
shooting range on Red
Pepper open for the fall yet?

627
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:15,370
Dispatch: <i>What's that, kid?</i>

628
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:17,540
The shooting range on Red Pepper,

629
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:19,207
is it open now?

630
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:21,310
<i>Nope. Why?</i>

631
00:44:21,312 --> 00:44:23,712
I... I'm not sure, I, uh...

632
00:44:23,714 --> 00:44:26,452
I'm at the cemetery and I heard...

633
00:44:28,385 --> 00:44:30,621
<i>What's that? What did you hear, kid?</i>

634
00:44:32,189 --> 00:44:34,256
<i>Kid?</i>

635
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:37,192
Nothing. Uh...

636
00:44:37,194 --> 00:44:39,529
I'm gonna look into something.
I'll get back to you.

637
00:44:39,531 --> 00:44:42,201
And stop calling me "kid."

638
00:44:43,834 --> 00:44:45,670
( engine starts )

639
00:44:59,584 --> 00:45:01,183
All right, let's go.

640
00:45:01,185 --> 00:45:02,819
What if he realizes you aren't guarding

641
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:04,453
the stairs anymore?

642
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:06,288
We got the broken glass.
We'll hear him. Come on.

643
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,323
Now, I want you to climb
down on this roof, right?

644
00:45:08,325 --> 00:45:09,758
There's a crate. Jump down on it.

645
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,261
Run like hell, all right?

646
00:45:12,263 --> 00:45:14,663
Hey, hey. Even if he hears you,

647
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:17,366
you'll be a little speck on the
horizon by the time he gets outside.

648
00:45:17,368 --> 00:45:19,569
- I don't wanna do this.
- Neither do I, Bird,

- Come on. Give me the camera.
- No.

652
00:45:47,365 --> 00:45:48,897
Come on, I'll take good care of it.

653
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:51,369
Don't you trust me? Come on.

654
00:45:52,736 --> 00:45:54,439
Bird, I...

655
00:45:56,207 --> 00:45:58,510
Okay, keep the camera. Come on. Go.

656
00:46:00,178 --> 00:46:01,743
That's it.

657

Stay low.

00:46:05,883 --> 00:46:07,385
Okay, go. Come on.

Afternoon, Officer.

Shit.

- Carter!
- What?

672
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,337
He hid the police car in the hangar.

673
00:48:11,408 --> 00:48:13,477
What? Where is he now?

674
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:17,412
He's far.

675
00:48:17,414 --> 00:48:19,817
He's walking back around the front.

676
00:48:27,357 --> 00:48:28,624
Freeze!

677
00:48:28,626 --> 00:48:30,558
Put your fucking hands up in the air.

678
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,997
Hands up. That's right.

679

It's over.

680
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:37,433
It's time for you to leave.

681
00:48:37,435 --> 00:48:39,035
I ain't got my glasses on,

682
00:48:39,037 --> 00:48:41,504
but that looks like that
same candy-ass 20 gauge

683
00:48:41,506 --> 00:48:43,372
you've been counting on this whole time.

684
00:48:43,374 --> 00:48:46,408
Heavy on power, shit for range?

685
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,711
That's all you got, ain't it?

686
00:48:48,713 --> 00:48:52,381
You got until the count of five

687
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:56,051
to turn around and get
the fuck off my property!

688
00:48:56,053 --> 00:48:57,653
You got to be kidding me.

689
00:48:57,655 --> 00:48:58,953
You probably couldn't even nick me

690
00:48:58,955 --> 00:49:00,756
with that potty trainer from up there,

691
00:49:00,758 --> 00:49:02,591
let alone make a kill shot.

692
00:49:02,593 --> 00:49:05,560
Hell, how many bullets
you got left, Jethro?

693
00:49:05,562 --> 00:49:07,330
I got plenty!

694
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:08,531
All right?

695
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:09,698
Don't you worry about it.

696
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,401
I got six reloads waiting on your ass!

697
00:49:12,403 --> 00:49:14,837
Good God damn, six reloads?

698
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,839
<i>Whoo, you're practically swimming</i>

699
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:18,374
<i>in ammunition up there.</i>

700
00:49:18,376 --> 00:49:20,408
Well, why not go ahead and try your luck?

701
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,645
You might sink a pellet
in my eye, take me down.

702
00:49:22,647 --> 00:49:24,647
Come on, what you waiting on?

703
00:49:24,649 --> 00:49:27,783
- Fire away!
- I'm not gonna kill you if I don't have to.

704
00:49:27,785 --> 00:49:29,352
When I first got to this dump,

705
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:31,520
you spit fire at me just to say howdy do.

706
00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:32,821
Now you wanna play trigger-shy?

707
00:49:32,823 --> 00:49:34,656
I don't buy that for a minute.

708
00:49:34,658 --> 00:49:38,660
Are you riding on just one
shell up there, partner?

709
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:40,995
<i>You are, aren't you?</i>

710
00:49:40,997 --> 00:49:43,031
<i>And if you take the shot at me</i>

711
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:45,968
at this range and miss, it's over.

712
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,537
<i>I don't think you can
afford to take that risk.</i>

713
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:50,508
<i>Let's ask the little lady.</i>

714
00:49:52,776 --> 00:49:54,410
Five.

715
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:56,011
I ain't going nowhere.

716
00:49:56,013 --> 00:49:57,846
You might as well save your
breath, go on and shoot.

717
00:49:57,848 --> 00:50:00,383
- Four.
- Look, I'm fitting to pull my pistol out

718
00:50:00,385 --> 00:50:02,051
- and shoot you now.
- Three!

719
00:50:02,053 --> 00:50:03,785
I suggest you either shoot me

720
00:50:03,787 --> 00:50:05,955
- or get your ass back inside.
- Two!

721
00:50:05,957 --> 00:50:07,693
- One!
- Shit!

722
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:12,093
I ain't calling you a liar, Sar. Greene,

723
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,464
but you got to be the most
merciful man I ever met.

724
00:50:15,466 --> 00:50:18,033
Hey, little lady. ( laughs )

725
00:50:18,035 --> 00:50:20,870
I just wanna shoot you.

726
00:50:20,872 --> 00:50:23,738
Hey, you made the right call, soldier boy!

727
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,875
Yes, indeed! Who are you to gamble

728
00:50:25,877 --> 00:50:27,877
with that little girl's life?

729
00:50:27,879 --> 00:50:31,383
Let's see if you gamble
with somebody else's.

730
00:50:36,421 --> 00:50:37,953
Sade: <i>Roll call!</i>

731
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:40,089
That's you, Enis.

732
00:50:40,091 --> 00:50:42,424
- Come on.
- ( gasps )

733
00:50:42,426 --> 00:50:45,093
- Tell us a little bit about yourself.
- You sick son of a bitch.

734
00:50:45,095 --> 00:50:47,796
Don't you disappoint me, hillbilly.

735
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:50,499
And speak up

736
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:52,968
so the man upstairs can hear you.

737
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,703
( panting ) My...

738
00:50:54,705 --> 00:50:56,839
my name is Officer Gerald Baker.

739
00:50:56,841 --> 00:51:00,575
Sade: <i>Jerry Baker! ( laughs )</i>

740
00:51:00,577 --> 00:51:03,712
Oh, tell us about, uh...
about the wife and kids,

741
00:51:03,714 --> 00:51:06,482
- two-cow garage.
- I have a wife

742
00:51:06,484 --> 00:51:09,017
- <i>and a son.</i>
- <i>Names, damn it! Give the man names!</i>

743
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:11,620
<i>My wife's name is Linda</i>

744
00:51:11,622 --> 00:51:13,988
- <i>and my son's name...</i>
- All right, cut it out!

745
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,058
<i>This ain't gonna work!</i>

746
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,694
<i>Just save yourself the effort.</i>

747
00:51:18,696 --> 00:51:20,629
You need to think about it, Sar. Greene.

748
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:22,163
You need to think about it real hard,

749
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:24,500
<i>get your mind right, see?</i>

750
00:51:24,502 --> 00:51:26,769
- ( sobbing )
- Jerry here ain't seen my face,

751
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:28,703
just like you, which means,

752
00:51:28,705 --> 00:51:30,738
technically, he's off the hook.

753
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,975
Also, he's not hurt too bad,

754
00:51:32,977 --> 00:51:35,611
which means you can probably
get him to the hospital.

755
00:51:35,613 --> 00:51:36,912
<i>But you're gonna have
to do it right quick,</i>

756
00:51:36,914 --> 00:51:38,948
<i>I mean, like, pronto.</i>

757
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,950
You don't have the leverage
that you think you do, asshole.

758
00:51:40,952 --> 00:51:42,517
Fuck leverage!

759
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,053
Do the math, dipshit!

760
00:51:44,055 --> 00:51:46,120
You send the little lady
down to me right now,

761
00:51:46,122 --> 00:51:49,258
you're saving two lives
in exchange for one.

762
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,026
Not to toot my own horn, but
that's a hell of a bargain.

763
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:54,095
Fuck you!

764
00:51:54,097 --> 00:51:55,964
Okay, you heard it, Jer.

765
00:51:55,966 --> 00:51:57,602
Have it your way.

766
00:52:01,071 --> 00:52:03,238
Oh, quit your whining.

767
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,040
Hold on, hold on. I got
something here for you.

768
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:07,977
- <i>Here we go.</i>
- No. ( sobs )

769
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:09,912
All right.

770
00:52:09,914 --> 00:52:12,982
That's it. Oh, yeah. That's
it, that's it. All right.

771
00:52:12,984 --> 00:52:14,216
What are you doing?

772
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:15,553

Go. Go upstairs.

Listen up, soldier boy!
What's it gonna be?!

784

Me and Jerry Baker are waiting

You're a piece of fucking
shit, you know that?

787

Sticks and stones, my friend.

788
00:53:04,901 --> 00:53:06,972
All right, have it your way.

789
00:53:09,205 --> 00:53:11,941
Stay with me. It's just you and me.

790
00:53:11,943 --> 00:53:13,611
Please stop! ( sobs )

but I guess I lost the
stomach for the hard stuff.

You wanna kill somebody?!

00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:21,343
You go ahead!

00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:23,678
<i>You got fucking brain damage!</i>

812
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,046
You're a sick fuck

813
00:54:25,048 --> 00:54:26,381
and you want to!

814
00:54:26,383 --> 00:54:28,619
- Not because...

A simple yes or no would've worked.

817
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:58,046
But, you know, you done
really pissed me off, Jethro.

818
00:54:58,048 --> 00:55:01,883
Matter of fact, you done lost
all your conversation privileges.

819

Yeah!

820

Radio silence starts right now!

821
00:55:05,856 --> 00:55:07,355
And it ends when you're ready

822
00:55:07,357 --> 00:55:08,991
to send the little girl down.

823
00:55:08,993 --> 00:55:12,326
Well, that suits me just fine, asshole.

824
00:55:12,328 --> 00:55:14,698
I'm sick of hearing your
goddamn voice anyway.

825
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:19,767
Just do me a favor... when you drop dead,

826
00:55:19,769 --> 00:55:21,069
just do it real loud, okay,

827
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:23,107
so I can hear it from up here.

Hey, asshole.

830

I don't hear him walking around anymore.

831
00:56:05,482 --> 00:56:07,251
What's he doing?

832
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:19,330
Let's find out.

833
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:23,233
All right, cocksucker.

834
00:56:25,035 --> 00:56:26,535
All right, you win.

835
00:56:26,537 --> 00:56:28,270
I gotta...

836
00:56:28,272 --> 00:56:31,339
I gotta get to a hospital, man.

837
00:56:31,341 --> 00:56:33,441
You... you can have her.

<i>You can have the girl, okay?</i>

839
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:41,350
You hear me? You win.

840
00:56:41,352 --> 00:56:44,086
I'm sending her down, all right?

841
00:56:44,088 --> 00:56:45,553
Just...

842
00:56:45,555 --> 00:56:47,089
Just get the fuck out of here

843
00:56:47,091 --> 00:56:48,993
when I do, okay?

844
00:56:58,368 --> 00:56:59,738
He ain't down there.

845
00:57:02,272 --> 00:57:04,038
He must've gone outside again.

846
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,241
I'm gonna sneak down there,
wait for him to come back in,

847
00:57:06,243 --> 00:57:07,810
and blow him in half.

- It's a trick.
- No, no.

849
00:57:09,245 --> 00:57:11,013
I just offered you up like he wants.

850
00:57:11,015 --> 00:57:13,247
That trumps anything else he's got cooking.

851
00:57:13,249 --> 00:57:16,517
He ain't talking back
'cause he ain't down there.

852
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:18,486
No, he's waiting for you!

853

Get in the bathroom. Lock the door.

854

- Carter, don't go.
- No time to argue.

855

A professional, huh?

905
01:03:24,921 --> 01:03:28,355
I don't lose. I don't ask for help.

906
01:03:28,357 --> 01:03:30,691
That's what keeps me employed.

907
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:32,894
Yeah, well,

908
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:35,263

924
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:13,734
Yeah.

Are you really the monster
you want me to think you are?

928

You don't have a daughter, do ya?

929
01:04:29,852 --> 01:04:31,819
Yeah, I got a daughter.

930
01:04:31,821 --> 01:04:33,687
What, you think monsters don't breed?

931
01:04:33,689 --> 01:04:36,860
How do you get to be what you are?

932

Oh, what the fuck is it with you?

933
01:04:41,531 --> 01:04:44,366
You wanna be my friend,
you wanna be my shrink?

934
01:04:44,368 --> 01:04:46,734
Huh? Or did you just fall in love

935
01:04:46,736 --> 01:04:49,571
with the velvet baritone of my voice?

936
01:04:49,573 --> 01:04:51,406
Come on, man.

937
01:04:51,408 --> 01:04:54,375
( exhales ) You wanna know,

938
01:04:54,377 --> 01:04:56,948

940
01:05:07,591 --> 01:05:09,390
Oh, Jesus.

01:05:09,392 --> 01:05:11,459
Oh, let's see.

942
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:13,727
Oh, yeah.

943
01:05:13,729 --> 01:05:16,698
The first guy I killed,

944
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,868
it broke me up a bit.

945
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,970
No, a lot.

946
01:05:21,972 --> 01:05:24,406
I couldn't eat.

947
01:05:24,408 --> 01:05:26,908
Couldn't sleep.

948
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:29,977
Couldn't even look myself in the mirror.

949
01:05:29,979 --> 01:05:32,846
Then something strange happened.

950
01:05:32,848 --> 01:05:35,984
Killed another fellow,
I felt a little better.

951
01:05:35,986 --> 01:05:39,053
Killed another fellow,
I felt a little better.

952
01:05:39,055 --> 01:05:41,689
Fellow after that, better.

953
01:05:41,691 --> 01:05:44,926
Pretty soon, the more
jobs I got under my belt,

954
01:05:44,928 --> 01:05:47,897
the easier I slept at night.

955
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:51,633
How many people did that take?

956
01:05:51,635 --> 01:05:54,468
I don't know. I don't count.

957
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,404
Let's just say

958
01:05:56,406 --> 01:05:59,741
these days I sleep like a baby.

959
01:05:59,743 --> 01:06:01,743
I don't know.

960
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:03,877
I don't know how you could
live with something like that.

961
01:06:03,879 --> 01:06:06,714
Well, something I read once, uh,

962
01:06:06,716 --> 01:06:09,019
stuck with me.

963
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,323
"He who makes a beast of himself...

Well,

we all got our ways of dealing with stuff.

967
01:06:26,702 --> 01:06:28,770
Guess for you, it's killing people.

968
01:06:28,772 --> 01:06:30,839
I kill 'cause it's my job.

969
01:06:30,841 --> 01:06:32,674
I take orders.

970

know what that's like.

972
01:06:36,912 --> 01:06:39,046
We don't kill kids.

973
01:06:39,048 --> 01:06:41,582
I kill for two reasons...
money and necessity.

974
01:06:41,584 --> 01:06:43,917
I don't kill for pleasure,

975
01:06:43,919 --> 01:06:46,087
I never have, I never will.

976
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:48,089
Why don't we roll out Jerry Baker

977
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:49,957
and ask him how he feels about that, huh?

978
01:06:49,959 --> 01:06:53,930
That was an intimidation
tactic, pure and simple.

979
01:06:56,066 --> 01:06:57,732
But I'm gonna do whatever's necessary

980
01:06:57,734 --> 01:06:59,770
to get ahold of that girl, you know that.

<i>She's gotta go.</i>

You don't look the devil in the face

01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:09,546
without taking the ride
to the bottom floor.

984

The devil?

985
01:07:12,915 --> 01:07:15,883
You really are fucked in
the head, you know that?

986
01:07:15,885 --> 01:07:18,788
Oh, so now I'm crazy, huh?

987
01:07:21,957 --> 01:07:23,993
Well, one of us must be.

01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:10,540
What's the matter?

01:08:12,107 --> 01:08:15,044
I'm sorry I got you into this.

Found her number in your phone.

1010
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:22,303
Gave her a call.

1011
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:25,206
Told her I was a friend of yours.

1012

That I was real worried about you.

1013

Being the close, loyal friend that I am.

1019

This poor woman drove
half the night to get here,

01:10:43,392 --> 01:10:45,259
ain't that right, ma'am?

1021
01:10:45,261 --> 01:10:48,161
Carter, I'm sorry.

1022
01:10:48,163 --> 01:10:50,764
He told me you were drinking.

1023
01:10:50,766 --> 01:10:52,066
I was worried about you.

1024

- You hush now, hear?

Somehow I doubt that, soldier boy.

- Really open her up,

<i>Now you get your mind right</i>

1044

You can't.

1049
01:11:43,753 --> 01:11:45,853
But if she was my wife,

1050
01:11:45,855 --> 01:11:48,089
I'd take the chance just the same.

- Sade: <i>Don't take too long!</i>

1066
01:12:28,464 --> 01:12:30,230
He tries to come up them stairs,

1067
01:12:30,232 --> 01:12:31,432
you shoot him.

1068
01:12:31,434 --> 01:12:33,367
It'll knock you on your ass,

1069
01:12:33,369 --> 01:12:36,103
but you'll hit him if you
aim down the stairs, okay?

Well, not that it ain't

I couldn't do it, man.

I can't send that little girl down here.

She's got it.

You want her?

1094
01:13:43,138 --> 01:13:44,871
Go get her.

1095
01:13:44,873 --> 01:13:47,175
Are you fucking kidding me?

1096
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:50,377
All she's gotta do is
aim down that stairwell

1097
01:13:50,379 --> 01:13:52,212
and pull the fucking trigger, man.

1098
01:13:52,214 --> 01:13:54,081
And you're drunk and you're slow.

1099
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:56,250
You'd be like shooting fish in a barrel.

1100

That's brilliant.

1101

That's fucking brilliant, soldier boy.

1102
01:14:00,155 --> 01:14:02,490
Just go home.

1103

- You win.
- You fucking coward!

1106

You need to bring your ass down here
