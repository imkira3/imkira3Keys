00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hi, Jimmy. I hope you get home OK...
You enjoy your flight and then...

5
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,000
I know how much
you hate flying so, eh, anyway

6
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Well anyway, I'm doing a big chicken on Sunday.
- Ask him about Sunday!

7
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, your dad is cleaning out the garage
and wants to know if you want
that old punching bag hanging up.

8
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
He's getting too old for that.

9
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,000
Anyway, give us a call tomorrow,
eh, when you land...

10
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,500
or today or whenever you can.
You know what I mean, eh...

11
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Can't wait to see you.
Love you! Bye!

12
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Wednesday, 9:36 pm.

13
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:11,410
Jimmy, it's Griff. Eh, oh God,
I don't know what to say.

14
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,130
I'm so sorry.

15
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,130
Listen, when you get back,
you give us a shout.

16
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,630
I'll get 'im, I promise ya.

17
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,630
I love you, mate.
Talk to you soon.

18
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,630
End of messages.

19
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,530
Hi Jimmy, how you're feeling?

20
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,630
Alright Deb...

21
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,130
Hi Jimmy.

22
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,130
Could I get a coke, please.

23
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,140
Yeah.

24
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,540
Look, mate, em... I'm sorry
about what happened.

25
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,140
I'm sure you can point me in the
right direction, Cal.

26
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,640
I didn't see anything, Jimmy.
Sorry, mate.

27
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,140
You live 50 yards away.

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,140
Look, if you're only here to cause
trouble, you may as well go.

29
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,540
- Terry!
- Stay out of this, will ya!

30
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
Trouble?

31
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,440
Jesus...
leave it!

32
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,540
Jimmy, don't!
Don't!

33
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,650
Jimmy! Jimmy don't, don't.
Oh, Jim...!

34
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,930
Jimmy, wait!

35
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,430
Just tell him,
will ya?

36
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,430
I called the fire service.

37
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,930
There were four of them.
They broke in.

38
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,930
I heard your dad...
screamin'.

39
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,430
I heard him screamin'
and I just watched.

40
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,530
I watched from the window...

41
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,430
'cause I was scared.

42
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,430
Who are they?

43
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,940
- Morning.
- Bye.

44
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,940
- Hang on.
- I'm Late, George.

45
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,940
- Oh, can you get the lawn mowed later?
- Why?

46
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,440
Jimmy's coming home for a few days
and I want the place to look nice.

47
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,940
He won't be back until Friday.

48
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,940
Yeah, but it's goin' rain all week
after today, and it won't get done.

49
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,940
He's been in the Afghan desert
for months. The lawn is the
last thing he goin' care about.

50
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,940
Besides, I want to put the cab in for service.

51
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,940
You alright, love?

52
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,440
I just want him home for good, now.

53
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,950
You've gone missin' in that picture.

54
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,450
I'd been in labor for 7 hours!

55
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,950
It was lucky you were behind the counter.

56
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,450
With your mullet and your earring,
talk about a mess!

57
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,950
One minute you bumpin' about on the back
of me bike, the next we got a baby boy.

58
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,850
We didn't know what hit us, did we?

59
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,950
At 10:35 that night I knew
exactly what hit us.

60
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,950
I'll mow the lawn
when I get home.

61
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,450
Thanks, love.

62
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,950
- She ain't carryin' no ten grand, mate.
- Oh, fuck off, man. I've been scoping her out for months, gov.

63
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,960
She better be, I ain't sittin' in the car,
gettin' big old cramp for nothing, guv.

64
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,960
About every Friday at half four,
she does the cash run, trust me.

65
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,380
What are you talking about? It's pushing
five already, you know.

66
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,660
What?

67
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
- Where're you goin'?
- Bank run.

68
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,460
Here. Take this over with ya.

69
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,960
- You never like doing the bank.
- I will if I take your car.

70
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
- Keep it on ya.
- Yeah, I know.

71
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
There she is, just like clockwork...

72
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,460
- Eh, there she is, she's on the move.
Hey, let's do this, yeah. Yeah?

73
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,460
- We'll take a left, Bob, head her off.
- Hey, give me my mask.

74
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,970
Oh, God!

75
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,970
Shit!

76
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:26,970
Come on!

77
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,970
- Where's the money, bitch?
- It's not in her purse. She must have it on her.

78
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,470
Where is it? Where's the money?

79
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,470
Let's get the fuckin' shit and
get back in the car, man!

80
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,970
No, you've got to be fuckin' kiddin' me.

81
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,470
Where's the money? Where'd you
put it? Is it in the car?

82
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,970
- What the fuck you want, man?
- What the fuck do you think you're doin'?

83
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
Get the fuck back in your car, man!

84
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,980
Come on! You'll have a day, a fuckin' day!

85
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Fuck off, man!

86
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Get back in your fucking car!

87
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,180
Fuck 'em up!.

88
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:20,280
Come on, come and get it!
I fucking dare ya!

89
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
- Come on.
- Hey, Sigmund. Sigmund, look here!

90
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,780
- Come on.
- Let's cover this stuff, wood boy!

91
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780
For fuck sake, let's go!

92
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,780
Hey, watch me, man.
Watch! Prick!

93
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,780
Are you alright?

94
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,790
And then he came at you. But,
you said he was behind you.

95
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,790
Mr Vickers...

96
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,690
Sorry. I just wanted to stop him.
I never meant to...

97
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,690
Yeah. Well, you should have thought
of that before you started swinging.

98
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,790
Let's get him out of here before the families find out.

99
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,790
Otherwise, we'll have Reverend McDaniel
giving us seven types of shit.

100
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,790
- Mr....What is it?
- Vickers.

101
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,000
Mr. Vickers, I'm DCI Holland. You're
gonna have to come with us.

102
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,790
How serious is this?

103
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,500
Mr. Vickers, I'm arresting you on
suspicion of manslaughter.

104
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,790
You do not have to say anything, though
it may harm your defense if you do not

105
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,100
mention, when questioned, something
that you'll later rely on in court.

106
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,700
Anything you say may be given in evidence.

107
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
- Do you have any questions?
- No.

108
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,300
Fantastic. Alright, the next time
we meet, it'll be down in nick.

109
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,800
- Where the fuck's my money, then?
- We had a little problem, Warren.

110
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Hey. Oh, it got on top, firm. Man meant
to do us some fuckin' Avatar ills, still.

111
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Where's the fuck's my brother?

112
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Oi...
that's the thing...

113
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Huh?

114
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
He's dead, Wass.

115
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,800
- You're supposed to be
lookin' out for each other.
- We do look out for each other,

116
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,500
but shit happens, Bob.

117
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
- What the fuck! You're supposed
to be to connect with 'im!
- We'll get 'im!

118
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,810
We found out where he lives. He
only made bail a few hours ago, Bob.

119
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,810
You find him and you finish him. Right?

120
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,810
And then we'll deal with it, yeah?
Trust.

121
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,810
Oh! No!

122
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,810
George!

123
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,310
Do you remember me?

124
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,810
George!

125
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,710
Shut your fuckin' mouth. Or...I'll
cut your fuckin' tongue out.

126
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,310
The fuck you doin'?

127
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,310
You're going to milked me.

128
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
No!

129
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
On the other hand, fuckin' me and
wondering what's happening to
my missus is a fucking tune to me.

130
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,820
It seems you had some bollocks
twelve years ago. You a fucking hero?

131
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,820
You're a hero, are ya?

132
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,320
But I bet when they let you out on bail,
you come right to tell your missus
you'd never get a slap, did they?

133
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,220
I stopped a robbery. I killed one of them,
as well. What's for dinner?

134
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Suppose I mention the lad, you killed his
brother, is right in there with your missus.

135
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Come on now, don't be like that.
You need a line all set up.

136
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
You can't go through life without
a grin once in a while.

137
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
So why don't you give us a really big smile.

138
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,820
Give me the phone.

139
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,030
Now. Go start the car.

140
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,230
Fuck that, man, I want to see them
go up the rude way.

141
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,830
You know, it was the mean old fuckers
who done you, right.

142
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,830
You're very lucky, mate.

143
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:44,830
See, I didn't get to say goodbye to my
little brother after you smashed
his fuckin' head in with that bat.

144
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,830
But I'm gonna let you say goodbye to 'er.

145
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,830
Cause I'm a nice guy.

146
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,830
See, I did you a little favor.
You're not my style.

147
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,830
I put a little more petro...
on the bitch.

148
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,830
Now, hopefully she lights off first.

149
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,830
Fuck me, it's cold...

150
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Don't worry, Georgy.
I'll turn the heatin' up.

151
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
How ya feelin'?

152
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,840
You're not doin' yourself any favors by
beatin' the shit out of people for info.

153
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
Yeah, well. Somebody knows something.

154
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,540
Well, maybe they do.

155
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,140
But doing this job for 6 years, you realize

156
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,200
it's every neighbor's god-given right to turn a blind eye.

157
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,140
Fear of gettin' a knife in their belly.

158
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,840
- So, stop poking around.
- And what have you got?

159
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,840
Nothing...
no one's talking.

160
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,840
One of the neighbors said they heard some
commotion about 11. Thought it was the TV.

161
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Then called the fire brigade at 11:30
when they saw the garage going up.

162
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,850
Saw a black BMW speedin' off.

163
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,850
There's been a couple of attacks
like the one your old man
stopped. We think it's the same lot.

164
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,850
Whoever they are,
people are scared Jimmy.

165
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,850
Were they alive?

166
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,850
Jimmy, mate...don't...

167
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,850
Were they burnt alive?

168
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,350
Postmortem suggests they
burnt to death, yes.

169
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,850
Have you seen Morgan since you got back?

170
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,850
No...I haven't signed the divorce papers.

171
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,850
Can you get me the CCTV footage?

172
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Jimmy, I've seen it, mate.
It's just weird rabbit masks.

173
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,860
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

174
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,860
Jimmy...

175
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,360
He stood his ground...
your old man.

176
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,860
When did ya get back?

177
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
Friday.

178
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,360
You missed the funeral.

179
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,550
Tryin' to make up for it.

180
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,360
I e-mailed you four...
five times, Jimmy.

181
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
I had a combat mission in Helmand.

182
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,870
Your commanding officer said you'd
been arrested and detained.

183
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,370
What happened?

184
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,870
You know I can't tell you, Morgan.

185
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,870
Oh, I think you can, Jimmy.

186
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,370
Especially when I have to arrange and cover
for you at your own parents' funeral.

187
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,870
Wait!

188
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,870
Sorry.

189
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,370
You don't have to be on your own.

190
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,370
Stop by the flat, sometime. OK?

191
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,370
- Hey, yeah, you on my best case?
- Fuck, man.

192
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
who the fuck is this?

193
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,710
Hey, this is Ronnie, he's alright
and he just wants some...

194
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,880
- Hey, I heard your stuff's awesome, fella.
- Get the fuck out of here.

195
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Bring him up to Caleb's in business hours.

196
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,380
- Yeah?
- Well, and they want half-an-ounce, I suppose.

197
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,380
We're havin' a party.

198
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,100
Well, that takes money.

199
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,380
This is four bills. What the fuck!
I said five.

200
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,110
Your guy told us four.
We only got four on us.

201
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,980
- We could-We'll just get
four hundred's worth?
- I said I'd get half-an-ounce.

202
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,880
I tell you what. You run me the four bills
and let me see your wifey's breasts.

203
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,890
- Naw, man. Look, let's just get four
hundred's worth, yeah? - No deal.

204
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,390
Babe, let's just go.

205
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,890
Babe, we need this gear.

206
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,890
I ain't asking for much,
just a quick flash.

207
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,890
You ain't even wearin' a bra.

208
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,390
This guy is sick, you know.

209
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,890
You actually thought I'd gonna give you
a hundred pounds off the gear...

210
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,890
- for a quick look at
your girlfriend's tits?
- I did, yeah.

211
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,890
Look, we're gettin' out of here.
Just give me my money back.

212
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,390
You ain't going nowhere.

213
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,400
That's crazy, you know.

214
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,400
You get the gear
when she sucks my cock.

215
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,900
No! Leave him! Don't!

216
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
- Stop!
- Take off your top.

217
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,900
They'll stop wailin' him in
when you start suckin'.

218
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,400
- Wait! Leave him! She's up for it.
- Dickhead.

219
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
You know,
I've got to record that shit, bro.

220
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck?

221
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:07,700
I told you to suck this dick. Do it properly
or I'll throw you through the window.

222
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
And you won't get no gear.

223
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,910
Mr Evans?

224
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,910
What the fuck you want?

225
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,910
Mr. Evans. We've had reports of a disturbance
at this address a few hours ago.

226
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,910
So what?

227
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,910
- Mr. Evans, have you been home all night?
- Yeah.

228
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,910
We have reason to believe that
a man has been assaulted on
your premises. Mr. Ryan Scott?

229
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,910
Don't ring a bell.

230
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,910
Can we come in?

231
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,210
Get the fuck out of here!

232
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,910
Mr. Evans, there's a young man in hospital
whose been quite badly beaten.

233
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,920
So what? It don't have fuck
to do with me.

234
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,920
So take your little fuck-puppet here and
get the fuck away from my yard.

235
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,420
Don't be stranger though, sweetheart.
You come back around here,
anytime you want, yeah?

236
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,620
- What was that?
- You heard.

237
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,620
What different reality do you
honestly think I would...

238
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,620
be interested in a tommy-sack
of shit like you?

239
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,620
Whoa, whoa. Come on.

240
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,620
Go on, girl. You have peace with 'em.
Reign her in.

241
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,220
You get that little pit bull on a leash, yeah?

242
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,620
Oi! Jenny, wait up.

243
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,120
You can't let them get to you.

244
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,500
We know he did it and we're gonna
go in and get away with it?

245
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,620
You've been a constable for five minutes.

246
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,130
Wanna make a difference?
Climb the ladder.

247
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,630
I'll be in the car.

248
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:08,630
The owner of the black BMW is a
Warren Evans, 3305 South Avenue.

249
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,630
You sure it's him?

250
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,130
Warren Evans had a
younger brother Joshua.

251
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,630
Joshua Evans was accidentally
killed two weeks ago during
an attempted robbery.

252
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,630
After receiving a blow to the head.

253
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,630
From your old man.

254
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,130
Hello?

255
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,130
What the fuck!

256
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,630
What the fuck! Huh?

257
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,640
What the fuck you doing driving into me,
like that, you fucking fool?

258
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
Huh?

259
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,040
Oh, you don't talk?
I'm fuckin' talking to you, bro.

260
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,140
Don't fuckin' look at me, bro!
What the fuck!

261
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
What the fuck, man! You crazy?!

262
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,140
What the fuck are you doing?

263
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
You know who the fuck I am?

264
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,640
Oh, you're a big man, yeah?
Got me tied up.

265
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,640
You cut me and we'll see what happens
to you, you fuckin' dickhead.

266
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,140
I'm gonna ask you once.
If I have to ask you twice,

267
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,640
I'm gonna cut off your left ear.
If I have to ask you again,

268
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,640
I'm gonna cut off your right ear.

269
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,650
Does that make sense? It's a very,
very simple process. OK?

270
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,150
Are we on the same page? Yeah?
Good boy. OK.

271
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:48,650
The couple in the garage.
Couple of weeks back.

272
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,150
Fuck you, man. Fuck that dickhead.

273
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:55,150
He killed my little brother.
He deserved what we did to him.

274
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,150
Hey. So, what was he to you?

275
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,650
I bet you're the son or
something, innit.

276
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,650
Your mom...fucked me.
Great ass.

277
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,450
We made 'em face each other, you know.
Before we lit 'em up.

278
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,650
So they could watch each other burn.

279
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,650
Should have seen the look on their faces.

280
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,660
Fuckin' priceless.

281
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,160
You know what?

282
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,160
I'm gonna let you go.

283
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,160
But you gotta do something for me.

284
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,660
- You're lying. All of this...
- I'm not lying to you.

285
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,660
- For real?
- Yes, for real.

286
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,660
Yes..
Yes, I like ya.

287
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,160
I need you to give me the names
of the other boys, yeah. Now...

288
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,960
See, take that, take that.
Now, listen, listen. Listen.

289
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,260
They're never gonna know, alright,
black and white.

290
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:04,050
You give me the names and you live,
if you don't...well...

291
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,470
Alright, alright.
Alright, fuck it.

292
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:20,670
Alright, fuckin' done.
Here, fuckin' take it, man.

293
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:28,570
But about that stuff I said before,
I took it too far, yeah. My bad.

294
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,670
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

295
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:38,320
But just imagine...Just imagine what
it felt like...to be burnt alive.

296
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,670
- What you talking about, man?
- The jolly, lad.

297
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,170
What you fuckin' talkin' about?

298
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,670
Hey, man, you said you'd let me go.

299
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:50,570
What the fuck you doin'? Huh? Please, man,
you said you would be helpin'.

300
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
Let me go, man!
Please!

301
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
Please! Please!

302
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,680
So sorry, man!

303
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,180
Please! I said let me go!

304
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,180
Let me go!

305
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,180
Please! Please!

306
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Help!

307
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Please! Please!

308
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,680
So sorry, man!

309
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,080
Please, I...! Please, man, you said you
would let me out of here!

310
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,690
Let me go man! Please!

311
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,330
Please let me go!
I said it before, man, please!

312
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,330
[Screams]

313
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,690
Not sleepin', are you?

314
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,690
The coffee's not gonna help, is it?

315
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,690
The sun will be up soon.

316
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,690
How've you been, anyway?

317
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,690
Yeah, um...

318
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:43,190
Yeah, good, but...the vets have moved
to a bigger building, right? Despite the...

319
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,690
Jimmy, I'm really sorry
about what's happened.

320
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,190
Do you think that was retaliation
for what your dad did?

321
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,190
Jimmy, promise me you're not gonna
do anything stupid. OK?

322
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Can I use your bathroom?

323
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,700
Yes, of course.

324
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,700
Wait a minute. What's that?

325
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,200
- That's just nothing.
- Jesus, Jimmy, you're bleeding!

326
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,700
- Oh, Morgan, just leave it.
It's nothing. Noth...
- No, sit down.

327
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,200
- Listen. Just leave it.
- Jimmy, you need a stitch. Sit down.

328
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Tell me what happened, Jimmy?

329
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,200
- Just a couple of lads in a pub, you know.
- In Afghanistan.

330
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Alright, alright...

331
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,700
Something works to get the guy to talk.

332
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,710
Ah, it's just....
It's complicated out here.

333
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,710
Really? Because somebody told me there's
no such thing as a complication.

334
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,710
Only a problem derived by a person,
not a situation.

335
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:17,420
Who, me? Oh, that makes absolutely no
sense, so...I must have been pissed.

336
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,710
Clown.

337
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,710
I will get around to signing those.

338
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,710
No rush.

339
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,710
Right, eh...

340
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,710
I'm done.

341
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,710
Wait, eh, a minute.
We'll put a dressing on it.

342
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
You got it?

343
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
It's all better.

344
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,720
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

345
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,540
Usually cats and dogs, but it'll do.
Hope you like scars.

346
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
I'm used to 'em.

347
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,220
How's your little scar.
The day I saved your life.

348
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Please, I was hardly gonna
bleed to death, was I?

349
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,950
Well, that was 20 miles away
from the nearest hospital,

350
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,780
in the middle of the Brighton Bay.
Anything could have happened.

351
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,220
Well, ah...

352
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Thank you.

353
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,730
- Hey, Morgan.
- Hey.

354
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,230
- What can I get you?
- Ah, cappuccino thanks.

355
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:57,010
<i>Mr. Evans was last seen yesterday
at the gym in Kenwood Downs,
last night at around 9 o'clock.</i>

356
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,090
<i>Big question is how Mr. Evans came
to be out there and why.</i>

357
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,730
<i>Nobody really knows what Mr. Evans was
doing out here on his own in a car.</i>

358
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,630
<i>In fact, It's yet to determine whether
he was actually alone.</i>

359
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,730
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

360
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,730
They've been on about this all day.
Who cares, right?

361
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,830
Just some dealer, it's just
what they come to.

362
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,730
<i>...And an explosion shortly after.</i>

363
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,130
<i>It seems that this particular area,
just up the Carmel Road, </i>

364
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,730
<i> is quite popular with teen-agers
and dealers.</i>

365
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,630
<i>In fact, it's been a troublesome spot
for some time now.</i>

366
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,730
<i>Mr. Evans was arrested 3 years ago after...</i>

367
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,730
<i>police caught him in
an organized crime gang</i>

368
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,740
<i>raided a flat in Garrison, East London. </i>

369
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,740
<i>Mr. Evans admitted being involved in
the supply of cocaine and heroin.</i>

370
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,630
<i>The sources said the six-year-old
Caleb Green, jailed...</i>

371
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,740
How the fuck do you know this Caleb?

372
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,240
Who else is it gonna be, guv?

373
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,740
You know they don't spend their
days much with these organized visits.

374
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,240
Boss was only talking about offing
Caleb last week, man.

375
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Hm. Boy, that's a little tawdry, man.

376
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,740
Hey, yo. Less with the gibes, alright?

377
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,240
Do this.

378
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,240
- What you asking, fella?
- Want to talk some business.

379
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,890
Fuck off.

380
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,740
- Go, on!
- David!

381
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,240
- You better know what you're doing, bro.
- Tell me you didn't do it. Tell me!

382
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,160
- What are you on about?
- You fuckin' know, Warren, man!

383
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,750
Oh, you're trippin' out, bro.

384
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,750
I ain't got a fuckin' clue what
you're on about.

385
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,650
Nah!

386
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,750
Have one chance
so you put the gun down.

387
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,750
And get the fuck off me!

388
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,750
And I'm gonna you both walk
out of here alive.

389
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,750
- For whatever offense it was.
- I ain't involved, brother.

390
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,250
That's not even loaded.

391
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,750
Try me.

392
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,250
Get up. The both of ya.

393
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,750
- Someone burned out his car.
- With him in it, bro.

394
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
And you think that was me?

395
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,660
Why the fuck would I take the time
to do something like that?

396
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
When I off some great problem.

397
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,760
- If I find out it's you, OK?
- I'm what?

398
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,760
You try and do fucko. Now fuck off. Don't
let me see you up in my block again.

399
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,760
Pair of fuckin' clowns.

400
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,260
I need some addresses.

401
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,260
Did it feel good?

402
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
It's far from left.

403
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,760
Jimmy, you gotta let this go, mate.

404
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,730
What? And let you lot sort it.

405
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,760
I got 4 names.
What did you get?

406
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:12,270
So this is it?
This is how it's gonna be?

407
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,270
I'll just stand back while you go on some
urban safari across London?

408
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:26,770
Now, you know as well as I do, this is the
only way this is gonna get done.

409
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,270
What happens if you do get one of 'em?

410
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,270
What're you gonna do, take a statement?
You gonna process 'em,

411
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,770
while they laugh at ya,
spit in your face.

412
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,670
You try and put them
in some cushy little jail,

413
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,270
where they sit on their fuckin'
ass all day, playing video games.

414
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,370
This country's changed.

415
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,870
The riots, just are starting.

416
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:54,770
There was a time I would've bled
to keep the red in the Union Jack.

417
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,770
Them days are long gone.

418
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,270
We've got a generation of offenders
we don't know what to do with, Griff.

419
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,280
And you know as well as I do, there's
nothing to stop them doing it again

420
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,280
There's me.

421
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,780
Revenge will never give you closure.

422
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,780
Revenge?

423
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,280
It's not revenge,
this is necessity.

424
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,780
Get me an address.

425
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,280
- How many were there?
- Two.

426
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,280
I know it's really hard, Mrs. Gilbert,
can you describe them?

427
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,780
One had, like a, a black and white hoodie,

428
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,970
I don't remember the others.
It happened so fast.

429
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,780
It's OK.

430
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,790
Look, I'll be in a sec, OK?

431
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,460
- Sir?
- Yeah, hang on a sec, will ya.

432
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,790
Alright, let's get on with it. I'm teeing
off with the superintenant at one o'clock.

433
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,790
And I don't want to be late for this shit.

434
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,220
Armed robbery, two suspects,
both in their forties.

435
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,540
Mr. Oliver tried to grab one
of the guns, apparently.

436
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,540
Other guy put two in his chest.

437
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,690
Held Mrs. Guilbert at gunpoint
and raided the till.

438
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,950
Cool. That's a tidy bit of business.

439
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:34,290
- Eh, any CCTV?
- Yeah, but it's a bit faded.

440
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,290
What's he doin' tryin' to
disarm them-the nutter.

441
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,800
I don't know. Protecting his livelihood?

442
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,300
Yeah, that worked out well for him,
didn't it?

443
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,800
- Listen PC...what's your name?
- Griffin.

444
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,700
It's probably just an insurance jump
gone wrong. Try not to
take it too personally, mate.

445
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,800
She'll make a claim, get a huge payout,
everyone's happy.

446
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,900
And the suspects?

447
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,300
Eh, get the rounds dug out of
Charlie Bronson over there

448
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,300
and have the morgue send 'em over to me.

449
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,840
It may take a while, but, eh, hey...slim
justice is better than no justice.

450
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
That's enough for me. Thank you.

451
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,300
- You're drivin', are you?
- No, but I'm a lousy drunk.

452
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,600
- Oh, yeah?
Hm... Define lousy.

453
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:33,810
Put it this way:

454
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:38,810
The last time I got drunk, I entered a
wet T-shirt competition on holiday.

455
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,870
- That right?
- I won, of course.

456
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:44,810
Course.

457
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,310
So, what kind of a drunk are you?

458
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,380
I can be quite incorrigible.

459
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,080
Unlike most people,
I embrace the effects of alcohol.

460
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,940
I don't beat myself up about
having a good time.

461
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,110
And this is your assessment
of my character?

462
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:09,110
No. But I can tell you're cautious...
timid.

463
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:14,110
And I reckon you're fucking shit-scared
that if you have that glass of wine,

464
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,160
that dress of yours is gonna end up on my
bedroom floor.

465
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,020
And your panties in my collection.

466
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,120
I'm not wearing any.

467
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,320
Sorry about that, guys.

468
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,320
Thirsty, dear?

469
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,980
Now. Where were we, Ronnie?

470
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,420
We were about to come down
to about 30%, Alex.

471
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,220
Finish these desserts and you're
both get the bill.

472
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
At least that's what your
lovely wife was saying.

473
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,600
Oh, was she now?

474
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,820
That's why I like to bring her along.
Good judge of character, my Susann.

475
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,820
- Aren't you, babe?
- Um hm.

476
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,820
You've got yourself a deal.

477
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:04,330
I might move Alex, myself. Smart move.

478
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,330
Excuse me for two seconds.
Will you?

479
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,330
You know it doesn't matter
what you wear to me.

480
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,330
But you don't look right without an
MP5 and a fuckin' ammo rig.

481
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,330
I'll take that as a compliment.

482
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,600
She's something else.

483
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,630
That's that fellow's wife, mate.
Drink?

484
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:46,330
I need to get my hands on some bits.
If you're still in that business.

485
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,330
Hey!

486
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,330
Hanny!

487
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,340
- You alright, Trison?
- Yeah.

488
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,340
What the fuckin' hell's that?
Excalibur?

489
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,340
Not walkin' about with it.

490
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,340
It's slender, titanium.
That'll go through a car door.

491
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,340
What the fuck do I want to
stab a car door for?

492
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,340
- That'll work, too.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...listen, listen.

493
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,340
Put that back. You're gonna have
someone's eye out.

494
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,340
What? You've never stabbed
someone before?

495
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,340
Now that is a SIG Sauer.
Peach.

496
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,340
Yeah, it takes 19 in the clip.
It's effective up to 50 meters.

497
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,750
The man knows his toys...

498
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,750
We'll take 'em.

499
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,650
I'll get him a silencer for that.

500
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:19,350
You should know, Jimmy, that ain't me,
no more. I mean, I did it
because you ask, but...

501
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,350
I appreciate it.

502
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:27,050
Jimmy...we go way back...
and I fuckin' know you.

503
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,050
That look in your eye,
it ain't good, mate.

504
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,350
I've got it under control.

505
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,650
Look, I feel your pain,
I really do.

506
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:40,360
Trust me, I'd be doing the same thing.
We should drink to Louis, mate.

507
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,860
So if you want to take a stand, you've gotta
be tall. Taller than you've ever been.

508
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,360
You understand what I'm sayin' to ya?

509
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,360
Take care, alright?

510
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,360
You need anything else, you just
let me know, alright?

511
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,360
- Hey, y'all.
- For what?

512
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,860
For Warren, yeah?

513
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,360
Hey, get some more in place.
I'm down for a piss kreig.

514
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,060
Hey yo, have you thought about
who it could've been?

515
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,260
No, man. You?

516
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,960
Fuck no, bro...

517
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:50,980
But we'll find 'im, yeah.
And when we do...

518
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,970
me, you and that scrawny
little shit in there...

519
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,270
will fuckin' ruin him, yeah?

520
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,470
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?

521
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,770
- Right.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

522
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,270
Line 'em up.

523
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,270
What the fuck is this?

524
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,770
What? You got a fuckin' problem?

525
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,270
Come on, then!

526
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:24,270
- You're gonna die tonight.
- No, I...

527
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,270
I know.

528
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:34,870
It's terrible, innit...

529
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,380
But it's the truth.

530
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,420
The only reason it hasn't happened
yet is because in your current...

531
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,380
unfortunate situation,

532
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,740
you leave me severely spoilt
with choices.

533
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,950
You see, I could...literally...

534
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,470
I could put anything in there.

535
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,780
Hello... Hello... Hello...

536
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,280
Sorry.
It was a bad joke.

537
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,490
You all done? You're tellin' me,
what's goin' on, bubba?

538
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,280
Stop fuckin about,
we're worried, fella.

539
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,690
Please, fucking shit-brain.

540
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,190
Who the fuck is this?
Where's Danny?

541
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,570
Danny can't talk, right now.

542
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,390
Who are you, mate?

543
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,690
You're the same guy
that did Warren, huh?

544
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,290
What's your fucking problem?

545
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,790
He deserved to burn to death

546
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,190
He deserved to die for what he did.

547
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:17,190
For what you all did to that copper.

548
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,690
About that, ya?

549
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,200
So what the fuck that's got
to do with you?

550
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,850
You think you're a fuckin' scary do ya
on the other end of the phone, yeah?

551
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,200
Fuckin' scary, aren't ya?

552
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,580
Well, let's go face to face, see how
scary you are, then. Where are you, bro.

553
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,200
Oh, we will go face to face.

554
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,200
And when we do,
I'm gonna annihilate you.

555
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,200
I...

556
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,350
I'm gonna fuckin'...
annihilate you.

557
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,200
Where were we?

558
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,200
You're gonna love this.

559
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:19,010
Now this is a little lesson...
in cement.

560
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:24,710
In the general sense of the word,
cement's a binder.

561
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:30,710
Substance sets, hardens, independently.

562
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:36,210
Binds materials together.

563
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:47,610
- Shit, no!
- Traces back to the Romans.

564
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,210
Till they used the term...

565
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:56,610
"Opus Caementicium" (Roman Concrete:
lime, grease, sand and water)

566
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:00,200
Hey, yeah, hey.
No, no, no!

567
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:36,910
Wow!

568
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,310
Two kids found 'im.

569
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:43,540
Where the bloody hell do we start
with something like this?

570
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,210
What is that?

571
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,720
Eh, mouth clamp.
I think dentists use them.

572
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,420
It looks like some kind of sex toy.

573
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,120
That's solid.

574
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,120
He might have swallowed up to two
liters before he eventually suffocated.

575
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,320
The cement has bonded all of
his internal organs together.

576
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,920
If you hit 'im now with a sledge
hammer, he'd probably break apart.

577
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,320
Fuck!

578
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,820
The pathologist is on his way.

579
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,120
No, bugger that.
I'm all over the CSI shit.

580
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,380
I've been waiting for something decent to
fall into my lap ever since I got promoted.

581
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,230
Hmm. Hold that.

582
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:28,180
You get the kids' witness statements
and let's have some coffees.

583
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:29,570
This is gonna be a long morning.

584
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,830
- DCI Holland.
- Anything else?

585
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,330
Oh, yeah.

586
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,330
OK. Yeah.

587
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:09,180
DCI Holand. Holland command informs me
that you have something

588
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,280
on your CCTV I need to have a look at.

589
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:12,930
Not me, love.

590
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,740
Well, someone from your telephone said...

591
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,140
It was me.
I rang ya.

592
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,330
Had these installed last year.

593
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,640
Mainly because after the last three
breakins we had, you lot

594
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,560
- said you couldn't do
anything without CCTV.
- Right.

595
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,270
Too busy sitting up in a warm
office doing paperwork, I suspect.

596
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,530
Processing criminals instead of giving
them what they really need.

597
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,340
- A good kicking.
- OK.

598
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Debbie.

599
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,920
Can I have a word, Terry?

600
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,740
What?

601
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,710
- What are you doing?
- Protecting my pub.

602
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:56,870
Your pub? We both know exactly
who you're protecting.

603
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,350
It is that fearfulness.

604
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:04,450
You know exactly whose car that is.
And you can't turn a blind eye?

605
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,350
They know everything.

606
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:11,150
They get wind that I've let this slip,
they'll burn the place down

607
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,350
with us in it. You've seen
what they can do.

608
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,850
Yes. And I know what Jimmy can do.

609
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,850
He can steamroller the lot of them.

610
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:23,090
Just let him get on with it. You can't get
him up to that shark in there.

611
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,360
We gonna look at this, or what?

612
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,160
There.

613
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,160
So what?

614
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,160
Jesus Christ!

615
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,890
Take-Take-Take-Take it back,
come to the beginning.

616
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,760
Play it-Play it from there.

617
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,760
And pause it.
There.

618
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,260
I got you,
you fucker.

619
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,260
Shit!

620
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,860
Fuck!

621
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,870
- Mrs. Vickers?
- Yeah.

622
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:38,630
It's about your husband, Mrs. Vickers.

623
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:40,870
Right, OK.

624
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:45,270
- Well, have you seen him in
the past few days?
- No, I haven't. Sorry.

625
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:46,670
- Not at all?

626
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:48,970
No, I just said I haven't.
What's all this about?

627
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:51,770
We may have reason to believe that your
husband has been involved in a

628
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:53,270
series of crimes.

629
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:55,670
Um, what sort of crimes?

630
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:58,360
We can't say, I'm afraid.

631
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,570
Well, if you see him, can you give us
a call as soon as possible?

632
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,130
Eh, this is the detective in charge
of the investigation.

633
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,680
OK.

634
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,480
Thank you.

635
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:30,780
Those murders... on the news,
they're you, aren't they?

636
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,680
Jesus, Jimmy!

637
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,890
Morgan, they executed my fucking parents.

638
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:47,640
Well, aren't you doing exactly the
same thing, what is that? Justice?

639
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,880
They don't deserve justice.
They don't deserve to live.

640
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,380
They need their hearts torn out.

641
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,880
They've been there all day.

642
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:24,380
Jimmy, you know, when they told me what
happened, I... I didn't believe it.

643
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:30,390
Who does that to an old couple?
It's just...

644
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,290
I just wanted to find you.

645
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:53,390
What happened?

646
01:01:56,890 --> 01:02:02,090
There were these six Afghan soldiers
we were training, turned on us.

647
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:08,390
Four Taliban...
killed six of our soldiers.

648
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:14,870
We needed to figure out if there were any
more among us, so they put me to work.

649
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:16,690
work on a Monday with just one client.

650
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:21,290
And I got him talking eventually.

651
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:26,280
And he knew so much,
just so much...

652
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:31,290
They would have fucking done us all.

653
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,890
So I couldn't let him live.

654
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,900
I had to hold him to keep our
space together, cause...

655
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,400
I went too far...

656
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,200
And they locked me up.

657
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,300
You escaped.

658
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,300
Yeah.

659
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,300
Jimmy...

660
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,020
Was there ever anyone else?

661
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,300
No!...

662
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,200
This can only end badly.

663
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,000
And what's the alternative?

664
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:57,010
You get in a car and you drive until
you don't have any fuel left.

665
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,010
You might have to.

666
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:02,210
And would you come with me?

667
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,210
Yes.

668
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:15,810
I have to finish this.

669
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:58,210
Holland.

670
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:00,310
I think we found your man.

671
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:07,910
Under no circumstances are they to
approach him. Just maintain eye contact.

672
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:10,210
I'm on my way.
Oh yeah, get me helicopters.

673
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:12,310
Yeah, and I want a SWAT team.

674
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:15,920
Yes, I know we have to call on that,
just get it done.

675
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,220
Hi, mate.
Got any ID on ya?

676
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,920
- What's your name?
- It IS him.

677
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,420
Put the guns down, Vickers.

678
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:17,580
Didn't expect to see you, Colonel.

679
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,420
Here to take me back?

680
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:28,320
As soon as you report in, son,
the better this will be for everyone.

681
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,920
Well, everyone's gonna have to wait.

682
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,320
This is not an option, James.

683
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,920
You're a serving soldier in this
country's most elite force.

684
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:42,430
Rooker knows the Afghan spilled his guts
to you and he wants what you know.

685
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:48,220
I've got a few things I need to finish first
and then I'll come in.

686
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:50,730
This isn't gonna bring them back,
you know.

687
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:53,730
What you are doing.

688
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:59,930
You're a good lad...
and you're a great soldier.

689
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:05,830
But you've got to let this go before
it turns into a mess that
even I can't clean up.

690
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:09,330
It'll stop when they're dead.

691
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:12,330
And then I'm out.

692
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,230
Out?

693
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:20,230
I've seen enough blood to last
a lifetime. I want a normal life.

694
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:22,440
What is a normal life?

695
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,140
A comfortable desk job at the Ministry?

696
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:30,640
Maybe driving a forklift truck around
some grubby warehouse?

697
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,620
Newspapers and sandwiches on your
lunch break? A flask of coffee?

698
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,340
People like you are beyond the
realm of social integration.

699
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:44,240
They sit here...
you sit there.

700
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:51,840
Psychologically tweaked to be superior to
all these drones that walk the street.

701
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:55,270
Align 'em and laugh.

702
01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:02,670
These people, if they knew what you've done
to keep them living their mundane lives.

703
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,340
They'd even kiss your feet.

704
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:12,650
You're a hero, James.

705
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:18,150
You do know that if they hadn't of locked
me up, I would have been there for them.

706
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:23,350
I was due home the day
before they were killed.

707
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:30,150
Pull over.

708
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:41,150
You've got 48 hours to clean up
your personal shit.

709
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:46,650
Then this turns over to Rooker...
and he's not a pussy cat either.

710
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:12,350
Dickheads!

711
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,350
Joe.

712
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:22,950
What you on, mate?

713
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:24,650
You got a second?

714
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:28,060
Yeah, but I just got to get these
tools back to the armory, so...

715
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,860
- Have to get on the mosey.
- Of course.

716
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,560
- You know Jimmy Vickers, don't ya.
- Yeah.

717
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,160
Yeah, I ran a support op for him out of
Fort Robinson for four weeks, sir.

718
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,360
Is Holland closin' in on 'im?

719
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,360
Well, man's trauma now. I mean,
he's gone mad, right?

720
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,500
You know about this,
his mom and dad.

721
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,470
Never mind that. You still can't  go
around doing what he is doing.

722
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,430
But you've got to give me the facts
if I'm gonna find him.

723
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:53,560
Hang on a minute...
are you helpin' him?

724
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:55,860
Joe, I've known him since
I was six, mate.

725
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:58,370
I think this is fucked!

726
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:00,680
I don't care who you've grown up with,
he's rotten.

727
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:02,870
He's out of control.

728
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:04,870
And Holland isn't?

729
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:07,370
He doesn't give a fuck about anything.

730
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:10,590
All he wants to do is lynch Vickers to shortcut
his way right to the top.

731
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:14,370
Can you imagine a prick like
him as Superintendent?

732
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:22,690
Just keep me in the loop...
please.

733
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:33,370
- Anything else?
- No, that's lovely. Eh, just the bill.

734
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:35,790
Spencer Holland.

735
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:40,090
Hey, gorgeous. On your lunch break? This
week's fare? Thought you cops were

736
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:42,680
fish-and-chips types. Eat on the
go, crooks to catch, all that.

737
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,880
Yeah, I'm in a bit of a rush, too. So, eh...

738
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:49,860
Are you? Yeah, that's right. Got
your hands full with those two murders.

739
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,630
Murders?
I don't know what you're talking about?

740
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:55,480
Oh, fuck off, Spencer, everyone
knows about your killer.

741
01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:00,930
"THREE LEFT," I heard. Sounds like a
vigilante if you ask me.

742
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,380
If you fuckin' write any of this,
I will end you.

743
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,680
Come on, don't be a prick!
I want a quick interview.

744
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,380
People have got a right to know
what's going on in their streets.

745
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,480
Right to know. Really? Are you
honestly goin' try that one on?

746
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,980
I know you know who he is.

747
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,480
How would you know that?

748
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:27,030
You're like shit at this. You can't lie,
I suppose. It's written
all over your face.

749
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:29,900
God, my editor will hump my leg
if I bring in this.

750
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:33,590
Look, I'll show the police in a
really good light. Police say:

751
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:36,590
"Zero tolerance on vigilante attacks...

752
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:40,590
DCI Spencer Holland closing
in on the psycho."

753
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:48,590
Try the salad. You've put weight
on since last time.

754
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:50,790
Look who's talkin'.

755
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:53,290
Nice to see you, Jules.

756
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,990
Do something, luv.
Do something.

757
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,420
You can move,
let me see 'em.

758
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:22,280
- No. Fuck off! Go get Suzy, yeah!
- Fuck you, wanker!

759
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,200
Yeah, I'll give you wanker,
you slut.

760
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,300
Here you go.

761
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:31,640
And, eh...this is off that bloke at the
bar, asked me to give it to ya.

762
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:49,280
Oh, no!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

763
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,580
Hey, what's going on, bro?

764
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,400
Hey, mate. I wasn't...
Hey, mate, come on. Please.

765
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,300
Please, please, please, please...!

766
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:11,490
Please! Let...me breath. Hey, look,
I'm...I'm sorry, yeah!

767
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,300
Please! I'm so sorry, I am.

768
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,800
What you sorry for?

769
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,500
Whatever I've done,
I'm sorry, yeah?

770
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:22,810
What?

771
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:26,310
Whatever I did to you, I'm sorry.
Please! Please!!

772
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:28,810
- You see, you don't even know, do ya?
- We talk.

773
01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:29,810
- Huh?
- No.

774
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,310
And that's the problem.

775
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:36,010
Little pricks like you, running around,
burning people alive.

776
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:40,680
And neglect to the emotional
devastation you cause.

777
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:45,210
I know who you are. Look, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to, please...

778
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:49,370
Sorry, I'm...No, I'm...
everybody's sorry, sorry.

779
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:53,210
Sorry's fuck all!

780
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:56,520
Sorry is a cast-away word on the
breath of the hopefuls

781
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,620
who have gone too far to right their wrongs.

782
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,920
I'll tell you who I am:

783
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,020
The last face you're gonna see.

784
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,720
No, please. I said I was sorry.

785
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:10,320
Come on, man. Please
don't do me like that!

786
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:13,320
Please! I'm a...
Please, please!...

787
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,150
Please! No, no! Please!

788
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:17,830
Please! Fuck no! Please!
Please, please!

789
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:21,730
No! You fuck...motherfucker...
you fuck..

790
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,620
Oh, fuck...
sake's please!

791
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,320
Oh! Fuck! Oh!

792
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,720
Oh! All right, just quit!
What ya doin'?!

793
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,000
Oh, fuck me, I'll talk.

794
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,450
Stop!! Stop!! STOP!!

795
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:33,320
You said you got your plate full...
some fairly gruesome murders.

796
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:36,220
Nothing I can't handle, sir, we'll get 'im.

797
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,720
- You think it's the same person?
- Possibly.

798
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:43,640
You think that's a safe assessment?

799
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:45,230
Without a doubt.

800
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:48,540
Why'd you think I became the youngest
Chief Superintendent in London?

801
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,830
I didn't want to deal with
those shits anymore.

802
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:57,430
You know, in 2003, I went to New York
on holiday with the missus.

803
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:02,330
The week we were there, the binmen were
on strike. You cannot imagine the smell.

804
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:04,330
Picture that size, it was in August, too.

805
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:12,780
Listen, people don't really care
or take notice of the binmen.

806
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:15,830
They don't care how they toss
out people's rubbish...

807
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:20,290
But the binmen who stop makes you
know that, the city starts to stink.

808
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,840
Do you understand where
I'm getting to with this?

809
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,840
I need you to know who
you are in this story.

810
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:32,370
I'm the guy cleaning all the shit
up to make the streets safer.

811
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,840
Well, if you are,
you're an idiot.

812
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,840
The policeman who thinks he can clean
up the streets is a deluded fool.

813
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,840
You don't rock the boat.
You look after number one.

814
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:47,940
Before you know it,
you'll have your own borough.

815
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,040
Be nice to be the next Superintendent
in London, wouldn't it?

816
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:52,740
Yes, sir.

817
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,840
You wrap the gruesome ones quick.

818
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:57,440
You grab the statements,
you scrape them off the streets.

819
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,940
And you keep the media out.

820
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,640
If the Commissioner finds out
about this gettin' out,

821
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,160
you'll be demoted to Constable

822
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,110
before you can say "Katy Price
is a virgin." Do you understand?

823
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,250
Yes, sir.

824
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,750
- Anything else?
- No, just the coffee, please.

825
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:43,320
- Can I help you, sir?
- I'll have a tea, please.

826
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,740
Sure, coming right out.

827
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:50,850
- Bloody cold, isn't it?
- Yeah.

828
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:55,450
Do we know each other?

829
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:00,280
I'm gonna need you to hand over
everything you've got on 'im.

830
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:03,850
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen, mate.

831
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:08,520
You see, he belongs to us...
not you.

832
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:12,670
Colonel Leach, he does belong to me

833
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:15,670
when he's taking the law into
his own hands in my borough.

834
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,360
Let me explain something to you.

835
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:35,290
September 2009...we get intel of
a major attack being planned
for the British mainland

836
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,060
on a scale that would make 7/7
look like the Teddy Bear's Picnic.

837
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:43,060
We ran an op to bring in the guy
who was planning the attack.

838
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:48,260
Taliban come down on us
like piss rain.

839
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,960
Worst firefight I've ever been in.

840
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:56,260
We couldn't exit with the prick so
we had to get what we
needed there and then.

841
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:02,260
It took Vickers 10 minutes alone with
the guy to get him to spill his guts.

842
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:08,090
While we were fighting off 30 Taliban,
he gives him everything.

843
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:12,260
Afterwards, Vickers executes the prisoner.

844
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:20,030
You see, these people,
they don't fear death.

845
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:22,470
They welcome it.

846
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:25,430
So you must ask yourself...

847
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:28,870
how did he get the goods?

848
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:34,170
Now we were in danger of being overrun,
so we had to get out of there.

849
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:37,970
No sign of Vickers.

850
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:43,870
He turns up three days later at
bastion, not a scratch on him.

851
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:46,570
No one knows how he did it.

852
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:51,370
If he doesn't want to be found,
he won't be.

853
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:54,770
He'll finish up on these guys and then...

854
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,680
...he'll vanish.

855
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:04,380
Well, I'll find 'im...
because that's what I do.

856
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:11,780
If you lay a finger on my boy,
I'll come down on you so hard...

857
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:16,280
they'll need paint stripper to mop you up.

858
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,280
Commissioner Shields,
I presume.

859
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:44,280
Superintendent Walsh.

860
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:46,380
- Didn't get your name?
- Carter.

861
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,800
And would that be a Mr. Carter?

862
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,880
It'll be a Chief of Staff Carter.

863
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,040
Thank you for coming at such
short notice, gentlemen.

864
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:17,490
You will forgive a somewhat hasty pace,
but we must get into this matter.

865
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:22,870
This man is the subject of an investigation,
is he not?

866
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:26,390
Jimmy Vickers, yes sir. He's a
suspect in a series of murders.

867
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:29,890
At no point will he be taken into custody.

868
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:32,390
Is that understood?

869
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:36,390
Perhaps we could dispense
with the cloak-and-dagger

870
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:38,890
display here and start over, hmm?

871
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:42,290
I'm Commissioner Shields, London Met.
And you are?

872
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:49,290
The man who makes sure that you and the
rest of this exquisite country are safe

873
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:52,690
every second of every day.

874
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:56,590
We're somewhat embarrassed
this individual slipped

875
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:59,390
our grasp, but I assure you,
he belongs to us.

876
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:03,820
Your man heading up the investigation will
report on the hour.

877
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,800
And you will report to us.

878
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:07,300
Is that clear?

879
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:12,300
Just, eh, throw us a bone here,
will you?

880
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,930
Suffice to say, that he works for
a unit within the confines of
our military infrastructure

881
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:23,140
that may benefits us with
his character profile.

882
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,800
He's SAS.

883
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:28,110
It's a problem you do not want
on your streets.

884
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:32,100
A problem that only we can deal with.

885
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:36,320
I need him back where he belongs.

886
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,300
What...!

887
01:24:59,910 --> 01:25:02,660
Open your mouth,
open your fuckin' mouth now.

888
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:12,810
Knock on the door,
knock on the door, now.

889
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:16,310
Who's there?

890
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:34,810
I don't know what the fuck your
problem is. Or who's payin' ya.

891
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:37,910
But I'll triple it, brother.

892
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:42,910
It's in that safe over there.

893
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:46,310
Paid a lot?

894
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:56,310
What's the code?

895
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:58,110
No, no, no...

896
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:01,710
- Let me out first.
- Right.

897
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,920
Wait! Wait...

898
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:15,490
Twenty-one. Six.
Forty-four.

899
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:29,320
Brotha?

900
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,870
What the fuck now?

901
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,320
What the fuck!

902
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:43,470
Brotha, what the fuck you want?

903
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,820
Brotha, talk to me!
Talk to me!!

904
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:49,320
What the fuck you want from me?

905
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:54,320
Talk to me...
bro!

906
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:00,220
No...no...no...no!
Bro...

907
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:43,330
- Sir, did you want to see me about something?
- Yeah, I do. Come in, have a seat.

908
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:46,330
Nick, give us the room.

909
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,330
Major coincidence is it,
that the last officer to

910
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:01,930
access to the files of these two gentlemen,
was you.

911
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:05,430
Prior to their deaths, I might add.

912
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:16,930
James Vickers,
soldier boy...

913
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:23,490
currently serving in a somewhat shady
department of her majesty's forces.

914
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:29,430
MID isn't exactly falling over itself
to fill us in, but we understand
interrogation is his specialty

915
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,030
and would you believe it?

916
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:34,730
They want to know the very moment
we apprehend him.

917
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:38,330
Is he done?
Or are there more?

918
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,740
I need to know who's next.

919
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,740
You don't need to know anythin'.

920
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,840
All you need to do is stay out of his way.

921
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,640
Well, I'm not staying out
of anyone's way, mate.

922
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:53,540
I'm gonna find him and
I'm gonna lock him up.

923
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,640
And whoever he's after,
for whatever they've done.

924
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:58,340
The last thing he's gonna do
is let you lock him up.

925
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:03,340
He's gonna wipe 'em out.
Or die tryin'.

926
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,440
"Die tryin" is good enough for me.

927
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:09,840
If he thinks he can go vigilante on my streets,
he's got another thing coming.

928
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:11,840
He doesn't care about you.

929
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:14,950
He doesn't care about the law.

930
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:19,950
He only wants one thing...
revenge.

931
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:24,450
He'll do more justice in one week
than we can do in a year.

932
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,350
We?

933
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:32,250
Mr. Griffin, I think we can safely say
you ceased being a police officer

934
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:34,850
the moment you started helping
your little friend out.

935
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:38,350
Well, good luck finding 'im, then.

936
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,850
It might take you a while.

937
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:48,570
But...hey...
slow justice is better than no justice.

938
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:15,850
"The UK could face austerity until 2018."

939
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:18,360
Jules, the boardline's "cat stuck in a tree", babe.

940
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:22,560
In it, you've got Morris on your major expense
report. Marcus on the tubes strike.

941
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,760
Well, that's it,
London's quiet.

942
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:26,860
Well, what about these murders?

943
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:29,660
Oh, I've hit a wall on that.
There's nothin' ongoing.

944
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,260
I thought you had a new lead?

945
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:33,760
Yeah, I'm waiting for more
information on it.

946
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:36,860
Don't wait too long, Abby's already
sniffin' to snatch it from ya.

947
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,060
Whoever you're stitching on,
let's have it.

948
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,260
Bitch.

949
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:14,760
Superintendent, how are you this morning?

950
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:16,860
Spencer, have you seen the papers?

951
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:18,460
What paper's that, sir?

952
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,360
Don't fuck with me today.
We have a real problem, son.

953
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:24,170
I want you to report to me on
the hour with this from now on.

954
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:24,770
Yes, sir.

955
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:27,070
You corner 'im, you call it in,
you do not get brave.

956
01:32:27,170 --> 01:32:29,670
You wrap it up, you wrap it up, now.
Do you hear me?

957
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:31,690
Yes sir. Eh, I also think...

958
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:35,970
What?

959
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:32,270
Later.

960
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:59,670
Oh right, right, right. Ohhh.
What you want, mate?

961
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:01,770
I wanta go for a drive.

962
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,270
Where?

963
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:06,470
Right, right, right...

964
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:39,270
What's that?

965
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:45,280
Sarin. It's most dangerous in
any of its other forms. It's a gas.

966
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:50,420
Causes spasms, vomiting. That makes
your insides put out their own fire.

967
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,280
But this is liquid form.

968
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:57,380
And this...is what I'm goin' put
straight into your veins.

969
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,480
Makes so much, love,
what this is.

970
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:05,270
You're gonna be beggin' to
put a bullet inside ya.

971
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,380
Look at me.

972
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:13,380
- Any last words?
- Fuck you.

973
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:29,930
You feel betta now, do ya, huh? You
fuckin' pussy. You feel betta now?

974
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:33,810
- Yeah, a little bit. You?
- I will, mate.

975
01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:35,390
What?

976
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:38,280
When I see your face in a minute,
I'm gonna put so much fuckin' back.

977
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:40,990
What the fuck are you talking about?

978
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:42,990
You got in the back of my car,
didn't ya?

979
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:47,820
Thinking you're holding all the cards.
You must be fuck-all Jimmy "fuckin" Vickers.

980
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,760
How long have we been driving for?
Ten...twenty minutes?

981
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,260
You didn't know,
did ya?

982
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:56,260
Didn't even know what was
in the boot of the car.

983
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,260
Fucking pricey, wasn't she's, brotha?

984
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:30,360
Popped a good fuckin' plan.

985
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:43,850
- Armed policemen, put it down!
- Move it, move it now!

986
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:46,370
- On the floor now!
- Move it!

987
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,600
Drop it now! Drop it!

988
01:37:00,970 --> 01:37:02,370
Wait, wait!

989
01:37:03,070 --> 01:37:05,370
I'm gonna give you the
count of three, Jimmy.

990
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:08,370
One...

991
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:10,970
Two...

992
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:15,370
You had 'im...

993
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:20,670
Who the fuck do you think you are?
You piece of fucking shit.

994
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:22,570
Don't fuckin' touch me.

995
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:25,370
You had 'im in the hospital
and you let 'im go.

996
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:28,030
Even though you know what he did,
you let him go and he killed his wife.

997
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:34,380
Tell him...tell him you're the reason
his wife is dead.

998
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,880
-Tell him!!
- Alright!!

999
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:46,460
I let him go. I let him go because I
knew he'd lead us to this fuckin' psychopath.

1000
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:50,380
I mean, I didn't know he was gonna go
and do that.

1001
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,010
But you know what?
Shit fuckin' happens.

1002
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,380
Stand down.

1003
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:05,380
What the fuck are you doing?

1004
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:10,380
Alpha One to control. The suspect
has fled the scene on foot.

1005
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:14,780
I say again. The suspect's fled
the scene on foot.

1006
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:15,880
Roger. We're down.

1007
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:19,280
What, you fucking insane? Are you
just gonna let him walk?

1008
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:28,430
Are none of you gonna arrest him?

1009
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:35,490
Alright, Jesus Christ. If you want something
done, do it your fuckin' self.

1010
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:44,490
Oh, no, no, no, no!

1011
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:45,990
Shut the fuck up!

1012
01:39:46,990 --> 01:39:47,990
Oyi!

1013
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:52,490
What the fuck you want,
asshole?

1014
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:54,590
You gonna do somethin'
'bout this?

1015
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:56,890
You've got three seconds,
motherfucker.

1016
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:59,890
Turn around and walk the fuck back
the way you came from.

1017
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:01,790
One...

1018
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:03,790
Two...

1019
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:06,440
Three!

1020
01:40:07,305 --> 01:41:07,789
