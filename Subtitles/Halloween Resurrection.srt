2
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,102
You've heard of the tunnel.

3
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,109
The one we all go through
sooner or later.

4
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,488
At the end, there's a door.

5
00:01:56,617 --> 00:02:00,329
And waiting for you on
the other side of that door...

6
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,081
is either heaven...

7
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,167
or hell.

8
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,300
This is that door.

9
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,519
Why is this patient
in lockdown?

10
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,312
They didn't tell you
about Laurie Strode?

11
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,522
No.

12
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,984
You must have heard of her.
Sister of Michael Myers?

13
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,278
Michael Myers,
the serial killer?

14
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,114
Well, you'll hear
all the gossip soon enough.

15
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
For now, let's just get--

16
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,908
No, no, no, wait.
Tell me about her.

17
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,536
She decapitated a man.

18
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,787
Aah!

19
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,752
Oh, my God. Why?

20
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:35,090
Halloween.
Three years ago.

21
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,134
Twenty years after
the first murders...

22
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,261
her brother finally found her.

23
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,640
Tracked her down to the school
where she was working.

24
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,684
There were several murders.

25
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,728
Lots of confusion.

26
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,872
Guys, over here!

27
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,596
Oh, my God.
She killed the wrong person.

28
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,183
Unh!

29
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,146
Father of three.

30
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,818
Why didn't the paramedic
say something?

31
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:47,996
His larynx had been crushed.

32
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,541
Don't let on you know.

33
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:01,218
Hello, Miss Strode.
Did you enjoy your dinner?

34
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,345
She hasn't said a word in years.

35
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:07,266
Extreme disassociative disorder.

36
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,894
The doctors think
she's a suicide threat.

37
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,189
They found her up
on the roof more than once.

38
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,570
Must be the guilt.

39
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,198
Now all she does
is stare out that window.

40
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,076
God knows
what she sees out there.

41
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,271
Hello?

42
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,778
Anyone out there?

43
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,629
Boooo!

44
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,423
-Holy shit!
-Ha ha ha!

45
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,968
Harold, are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

46
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,594
No.

47
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,472
How the hell
did you get out again?

48
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,975
And who are you
supposed to be today?

49
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,812
Oh. John Wayne Gacy.

50
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,064
Born in Chicago, Illinois,
on March 17, 1942.

51
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,066
Come on, big guy.

52
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,569
Killed 33 people.
Buried them under his house.

53
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:24,903
I know, Harold.

54
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,573
-He was executed on May 7--
-I know, Harold.

55
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,954
Willie, I'm not trying
to criticize your work...

56
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,248
but if you put Harold
in his room...

57
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,292
how come I see him
in the basement?

58
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:42,337
I--But just
two seconds ago, he was--

59
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,631
Come on. Let's go get him.

60
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,508
How many times
do I have to tell you?

61
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,635
You gotta be sure
what you're doing.

62
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,284
Willie?
What are you doing?

63
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,328
I skipped dinner.

64
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,914
-Hurry up.
-OK.

65
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,419
Harold?

66
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,133
Harold,
what are you doing down here?

67
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,223
What's gotten into you?

68
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,961
Aah! Aah!

69
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,922
Aah! Unh!

70
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,392
Aah!

71
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,578
Hmm. Ted Bundy.

72
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:23,123
Born November 24, 19...

73
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:14,359
Hello, Michael.

74
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:40,469
I knew you'd come for me
sooner or later.

75
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,805
What took you so long?

76
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,364
You failed, Michael.

77
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,784
You want to know why?

78
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,996
Because I'm not afraid of you.

79
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,958
But what about you?

80
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,712
Are you afraid of me?

81
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,343
Are you afraid to die, Michael?

82
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,014
I just have to be sure.

83
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,905
Unh! Unh!

84
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,948
Aah!

85
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,576
Aah!

86
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,786
Aah!

87
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,998
Aah!

88
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,142
I'll see you in hell.

89
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:45,654
Michael Myers.

90
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:50,200
Born October 19, 1957.

91
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:54,913
Killed his older sister,
October 31, 1963.

92
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:59,835
Killed 3 high school students,
October 31, 1978.

93
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:04,339
Also killed three nurses
and a paramedic, same night.

94
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,678
Was believed to be dead,
then killed four students...

95
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,804
Was believed to be dead,
then killed four students...

96
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,348
Hillcrest Academy, 1998.

97
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:17,853
Has been missing, unheard of,
last three years.

98
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:22,191
Now he's back.

99
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,008
Carl Jung tells us...

100
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,886
that the human psyche
contains...

101
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,346
a figment of ourselves...

102
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:56,767
that even the collective
unconscious denies.

103
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,852
Good morning, Paul.
It's nice to see you in class.

104
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,604
Am I keeping you up?

105
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,482
What do I mean by all this,
people?

106
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,902
I mean that inside all of us...

107
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:12,324
there lurks
a dark, malevolent figure.

108
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,994
A kind of boogeyman,
if you will...

109
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,747
that Jung called what?

110
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,541
Stick with me, people.

111
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,335
Take that Kierkegaardian
leap of faith.

112
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,424
Jung said we must
face down our fears...

113
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:33,554
and face up to the figure
he called...what?

114
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,683
-The shadow.
-The shadow.

115
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,977
Yes, Sara, very good.
Thank you.

116
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,938
I'm glad somebody was awake.
Wow, what a class.

117
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:49,653
Hey, Sara!

118
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,321
Sara, wait up!

119
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,284
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

120
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,660
Guess what?

121
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,454
Uh-uh. What did you
sign us up for this time?

122
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,457
Eee, ha ha!
We gotta find Rudy. Come on.

123
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,349
Hey, Rudy.

124
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,143
Don't distract me.

125
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,353
I can't help myself.

126
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:27,149
I am distracting.

127
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,817
Have you checked your email?

128
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:31,195
No.

129
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,988
Why?
Did you send me something?

130
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,866
We're in!
They picked all three of us!

131
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,827
-What? Are you serious?
-Uh-huh!

132
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:42,706
Oh, God! Yes!

133
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,166
All right. That is all good.

134
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,668
This isn't one of
your little jokes, is it?

135
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:50,047
No, but Sara doesn't want to go.

136
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,007
I might go.
I just haven't decided yet.

137
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,843
No, no, no.
That is unacceptable.

138
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,970
It is unacceptable.

139
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,139
We're gonna be bigger
than "The Osbournes."

140
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,016
We're gonna be large.

141
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,185
Every time I let you two
talk me into something...

142
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,603
I live to regret it.

143
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,439
Listen, without me,
you would die of boredom.

144
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:11,193
Us! Without us,
you would die of boredom.

145
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,153
Whatever.

146
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,950
Are you sure they're not
just putting us in some house...

147
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,077
with hidden cameras
in the shower?

148
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,162
No.

149
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,456
It's like we're
investigative reporters...

150
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,959
searching a crime scene.

151
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,585
And look at the scholarship.

152
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,546
Yeah.

153
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,173
Besides that,
thousands of people...

154
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,717
are going to see my face...

155
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,428
our face.

156
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,181
Don't do it.

157
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,517
That's the house
where it all started.

158
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,604
He walked its hallways,
hid in its closets...

159
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:48,939
dreamed in its bedrooms...

160
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,232
helped his mother
in the kitchen...

161
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:53,026
watched TV in the living room
with his dad...

162
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,572
played in his sister's bedroom.

163
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,452
Then one day,
he picked up a knife...

164
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,165
and he never put it down again.

165
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,222
That guy's fucking weird.

166
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:25,934
Don't pay attention to him.
He's trying to scare us.

167
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,562
I just need to send
a quick email.

168
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,360
"Deckard...

169
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,988
"you'll never believe
what I got myself into."

170
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:42,910
Deckard? Who's Deckard?

171
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,578
Oh, it's my screen name.

172
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,497
Sara needed some tech support
setting up her offline reader...

173
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,749
so I, uh...

174
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:52,085
You told her
you're a graduate student?

175
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:55,172
-Graduate of what, junior high?
-Shut up, all right?

176
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:59,259
We talk every day.
It's kind of like we're dating.

177
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:00,802
She's never even seen you...

178
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,804
and Yahoo chat rooms
do not count.

179
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:05,766
Yes, they do count.
Did you know in the old days...

180
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,518
knights used to spend
their entire lives...

181
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,478
courting ladies that
they would never even touch?

182
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,898
They would just send
each other sonnets and stuff.

183
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,943
That's before
internet porn, man.

184
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,320
Whatever.

185
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,072
Now what are you doing?

186
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,740
Just give me a second,
all right?

187
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:38,757
I hope Sara shows up.

188
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,968
And wearing
something acceptable.

189
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,429
She can't still be mad at us
for the last time.

190
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:47,850
Here she is. Hey!

191
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,852
OK, everybody listen up!

192
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,563
Sara, are you gonna wear this?

193
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,941
I thought I told you
we were gonna be on camera.

194
00:21:55,983 --> 00:22:00,362
I'd like to start this off
by saying the search is over.

195
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,739
You six have been selected...

196
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,534
to explore
America's worst nightmare--

197
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,703
tomorrow night, Halloween...

198
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,831
live, in front of the whole
entire internet universe.

199
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:14,168
You six will enter
the birthplace of evil...

200
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,586
in its purest form--

201
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:19,214
the childhood home of
our most brutal mass murderer...

202
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:22,801
Michael Myers.

203
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:28,223
Thank you. Thank you.

204
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:30,934
So, what do you hope to find
in the house tomorrow night?

205
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,187
My way into
network broadcasting.

206
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,396
Pfft!

207
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,398
I just want to say
that Michael Myers...

208
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,109
is not just
a man behind a mask...

209
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:40,360
he's a legend.

210
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,821
I'm interested
in how Michael Myers...

211
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,115
embodies
the politics of violence...

212
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,909
embedded in pop mythology.

213
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,746
Never underestimate
the effect of a poor diet.

214
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,873
Too much protein, not enough
zinc, next thing you know...

215
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,082
you're cutting up bodies
in your bathtub.

216
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,752
Look at Hitler.
He was a vegetarian.

217
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,879
The brother
was seriously malnourished.

218
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,924
You don't have to go far
to find Michael Myers.

219
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:05,677
He is the great white shark
of our unconscious.

220
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,597
He is the dark-eyed child
of our spirits.

221
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:11,225
He's every murderous impulse
we've ever had.

222
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,769
He's the little voice
that whispers to us...

223
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,187
to strangle the old lady...

224
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,980
taking too long
at the checkout counter.

225
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,441
Get to know him, baby.

226
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:22,110
He's you.

227
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:25,948
Tell us, Sara, why do
ordinary people turn to murder?

228
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:29,201
Well, I, um...

229
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:32,913
I think it has something
to do with upbringing.

230
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,415
Aah!

231
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:38,085
Damn! That girl can sing.

232
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,259
That's what
I'm looking for. Ooh.

233
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,303
Ha! Hunh!

234
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,514
Hyah!

235
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,850
Get his ass! Get his ass!
Get his ass!

236
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,187
Who's better than Wat Chun Lee?

237
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,648
Whoopin' everybody ass
while he's smokin' a cigarette.

238
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,987
Oh, shit. Who's knockin'
on my door this late?

239
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,405
Whoever this is
is distracting me...

240
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:09,408
from seeing Wat Chun Lee
whoop some ass.

241
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,035
Sara? Ooh.

242
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,789
Sara, what are you doing here?
It's late.

243
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,457
I'm dropping out.

244
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,001
What?

245
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:20,460
I'm sorry.

246
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:23,130
It's just I'm so freaked out
I can't even sleep.

247
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:26,175
Slow down, slow down.
What's the problem?

248
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:29,595
Can't you see
I'm not like the others?

249
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,722
I know
you're not like the others.

250
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,557
You know
you're not like the others.

251
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,517
The others ain't nothin'
but a bunch...

252
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:38,353
of smart-ass, wise-crackin',
posin' wannabes.

253
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,731
You are the real deal.

254
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,025
Every existing element
about you...

255
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,195
is what the internet audience
really wants.

256
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,988
I don't want to be famous.

257
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,990
What do you mean
you don't want to be famous?

258
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:52,743
That's the American dream.

259
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,995
I think I'm just scared.

260
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,372
It's OK to be scared.

261
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:59,541
Being scared is good.
Fear is good.

262
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,919
Fear motivates.

263
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,588
Fear gives you
the feeling of being alive.

264
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:05,923
Fear makes me want to throw up.

265
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,883
Trust me, please.

266
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,801
When it's all said and done,
at the end of the day...

267
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:12,346
you'd be surprised of
how much you surprise yourself.

268
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:15,098
I'm sorry to bother you.
I just--

269
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,726
It's OK. Do me a favor.
Sleep on it.

270
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:20,729
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
You can sweat it tonight, man.

271
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:23,357
Now take your tail on outta here
and go to bed.

272
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,695
Ol' Freddie boy, damn, you good.

273
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,573
Shit you come up with
off the top of your head, boy.

274
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:35,410
Why don't you just
pat yourself on your back?

275
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,746
Oh, Wat Chun Lee! Oh!

276
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,092
Now, are you coming out soon...

277
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,718
or are you
planning on subletting?

278
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:57,599
Mmm! Sexy girl! Ha ha!

279
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:59,726
Don't you think
it's a bit too revealing?

280
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,938
I think
it's perfectly revealing.

281
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,189
Aah!

282
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:06,817
What?

283
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,945
Are you OK?

284
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,322
Did you see the
boogeyman or something?

285
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:16,159
The boogeyman?
How very Jungian.

286
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,788
Dr. Mixter's class?
I'm taking that course, too.

287
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:21,915
I hope they have this in black.

288
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:25,210
-Thrift stores.
-Oh, how marvelous, darling.

289
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:28,463
Ahh, there she is.

290
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,799
Oh, my God,
you've been pussy-whipped.

291
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:34,136
What's worse,
you've been cyber-whipped.

292
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,762
By the way,
where's your costume?

293
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,390
I can't go out tonight.

294
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,392
I promised Sara
I would watch her first episode.

295
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,102
She's really nervous about it.

296
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:46,648
No, Mickey Stern's party
is tonight, and you know that.

297
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,818
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, man.
I guess I forgot.

298
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,613
Forgot?
Do you have any idea...

299
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,531
what it means for
two freshmen to get invited?

300
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,116
It's never happened before!

301
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:57,284
Your sister invited us...

302
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,453
so you wouldn't tell
your mother about her tattoo.

303
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,997
That's besides the point,
Myles Barton.

304
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,833
You can sit here in your little
dream fantasy world...

305
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,836
or you can come with me
to this party...

306
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,671
and learn to walk like a man.

307
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,715
What's it gonna be?

308
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:15,844
All right, let's go.

309
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:19,097
Ahh, chat room romance?

310
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:21,016
He's just a friend.

311
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:23,727
He's probably fifty and bald,
with a bad toupee.

312
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:28,899
-Jen.
-Probably collects human skin.

313
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:30,651
Give me a break, Jen.

314
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,319
OK, everybody listen up.

315
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,196
I'd like to start off
by saying...

316
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:35,989
the home that
you will be entering tonight...

317
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,574
has been rigged up
with several cameras...

318
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:38,867
but for the most part...

319
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:43,205
the audience will see
only what you see.

320
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,414
See these cameras right here?

321
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,000
I kinda like these cameras.

322
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,546
They can pretty much be
clipped on to anything.

323
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:53,715
A hat, shirt collar,
your coat collar.

324
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,469
The viewers
can pretty much control...

325
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:58,720
what they want to watch...

326
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:01,181
switch around
from camera to camera...

327
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:03,976
depending on what seems to be
the most intriguing to them.

328
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:07,229
So if you guys want
to be stars for the night...

329
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:10,232
I suggest you do something
that is very interesting...

330
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:12,401
so that it's worth the while
of the viewers...

331
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:16,029
to want to keep
their cameras on you.

332
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,574
Cameras are so phallic.

333
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,826
Is that good or bad?

334
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,369
Depends who's watching.

335
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:46,226
Hey, Orson Welles,
pick a placement and move on.

336
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:52,441
Look, low angles--scary.

337
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:55,277
High angles--scary.

338
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:59,031
Medium angles--boring.

339
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,365
I bet you learned that
shooting...

340
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:01,992
all those weddings
and bar mitzvahs.

341
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,452
Hey, hey!

342
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:07,456
I went to Long Beach State.
Same as Spielberg.

343
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,583
NORA: Charley,
we're on a schedule here.

344
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,960
Tell Max to rig a camera
in the sister's room.

345
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:15,088
Max is back at the hotel
helping Freddie.

346
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:17,216
OK.

347
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:46,722
Freddie!

348
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,057
Baby, calm down.
It's all good. Just relax.

349
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,226
I got it all under control.

350
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,397
There was this Firebird
parked in front of the house.

351
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,858
Totally about to ruin
the establishing shot...

352
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,152
but I called a tow truck.

353
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,862
Yep, it's on its way.

354
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,406
All righty. Bye.

355
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:12,080
Look at you, Charley.
That's a nice angle, boy.

356
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,336
Look, there he is now.

357
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,546
All right, here we go.

358
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,964
Mr. Harris!

359
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,008
Can we ask you
a few questions, Mr. Harris?

360
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,427
-Right over here.
-I got one word for you.

361
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,929
-What's that?
-Product placement.

362
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,096
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

363
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,224
Product placement,
I like the sound of that.

364
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:32,142
While we're going
around the house...

365
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:33,894
discovering the secrets
of Michael Myers...

366
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:39,274
we could be drinking Pepsi
or sporting The Gap, right?

367
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:44,279
Nice sexy thinking.
I kind of like that.

368
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,864
How's everyone doing
this evening?

369
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:47,950
We'll get it started
like this, see?

370
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,535
In the next ten minutes...

371
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:50,869
we are going to enter
a mystery...

372
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:53,163
wrapped up inside of a riddle
inside of an enigma.

373
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,500
Now, remember this.
Everything you see...

374
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:59,461
absolutely everything
you see is real.

375
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:01,296
There's no actors...

376
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,423
none of the components
or contents in the house...

377
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,467
have been messed with,
mixed up, diluted...

378
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:09,471
or tampered with in any shape,
form, or fashion whatsoever.

379
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,266
Now, I'm not exactly sure
what's gonna happen...

380
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:15,310
but what I do know is
that no one will be allowed...

381
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:17,354
to leave
until the show is over.

382
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,315
Our state-of-the-art
camera surveillance system...

383
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:22,651
will pick up
anyone who tries to sneak out.

384
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:32,911
Let the Dangertainment begin
out this motherfucker.

385
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:36,248
Well, people, let's do it.

386
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:01,148
Rudy!

387
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:08,488
Way to go.
This is gonna be fun.

388
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,346
I read that
after the murders...

389
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:33,680
the family
just sealed it up...

390
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:36,225
and left without
taking anything with them.

391
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:40,270
It's not exactly
a house you put on the market.

392
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:41,939
Yeah, but I'll bet it has...

393
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,900
one of those big nice
old kitchens, you know?

394
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,028
Where are you going?

395
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:49,613
I'm gonna check it out.

396
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,616
What are we gonna do?

397
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,618
We don't have to do anything.

398
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:57,079
Technically,
we just have to be in the house.

399
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,414
Aren't we supposed
to be looking for answers?

400
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:02,251
The devil made him do it.
I'm done.

401
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:05,587
We owe it
to the people watching...

402
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:09,049
to at least take a look around.

403
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:10,425
Oh, that's cute.

404
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,262
You're already worried
about your fan base?

405
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:20,435
You are this close
to getting voted off the island.

406
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,859
Hey, check this out.

407
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,069
You want something
tasty and delicious?

408
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:32,948
You ever tasted
forty-year-old fennel?

409
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:36,243
Eww, don't.
It's got to be rotten.

410
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:38,287
-That's strange.
-What?

411
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,040
-It smells fresh.
-Yeah, it does.

412
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:48,297
You know, Donna,
you got great legs.

413
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,007
What time do they open?

414
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:52,801
That'd be 1:00?

415
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:56,471
God damn.

416
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,643
Sara.

417
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,399
You think this is the one
that he used to do his thing?

418
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,652
No. They'd keep that in
an evidence locker somewhere.

419
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,112
Whew.

420
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:22,623
-Boo.
-Aah!

421
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:26,001
-What, are you scared?
-No.

422
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:27,503
What's in here?

423
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:34,468
What is that?

424
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:41,934
OK, so I admit...

425
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:45,229
that this place
is a little creepy, OK?

426
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:48,524
No, no, no.
You have no idea.

427
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:52,110
-Look at this.
-Wow, a chair.

428
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:53,403
My God.

429
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:56,490
Do you think they actually
kept him in this?

430
00:35:58,283 --> 00:35:59,451
What is that?

431
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:02,371
Looks like the medieval key
to Sara's chastity belt.

432
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,706
-Rudy!
-OK, yeah.

433
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,709
Maybe we should
poke around a bit...

434
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,211
see what else we can find.

435
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:12,464
Ha! Aye-aye, captain.

436
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:16,969
Why are you touching me?

437
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:18,637
Don't.

438
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,224
Go poke.

439
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:56,049
Hey, what's going on?

440
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,801
Sexy.

441
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,555
Look at you!

442
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:07,936
Scott, what are we doing here?

443
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:10,689
Hey, come on, man,
be cool, all right?

444
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:13,609
Relax. Have fun. Shit.

445
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:16,486
Hey, Myles,
do you think anyone will know...

446
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:18,864
we're supposed to be
from "Pulp Fiction"?

447
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,765
-Huhh!
-Huhh!

448
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:25,430
Today, you're scared of
the boogeyman.

449
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:27,349
Ha ha ha!

450
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:30,894
He's gonna get you.
He's coming behind you.

451
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,354
Boogeyman!

452
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,871
Ohh! Shit!

453
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,915
Careful, Jen.

454
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:35,751
Ahem. Hands off, bud.

455
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:58,148
Bet this is Judith's room.

456
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:01,735
You know, the older sister.

457
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:05,155
The one he killed
when he was six years old.

458
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:09,117
Hey! Keep the camera
on the money here.

459
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,995
I think it happened
when she was right there.

460
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:16,166
Poor little Judith...

461
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,168
helpless...

462
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:21,505
brushing her hair...

463
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:25,259
young...and naked.

464
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,971
Yeah, because
that's gonna happen, right?

465
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:30,973
Come on, Jen.

466
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:32,766
One flash,
and you could light up...

467
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,727
a thousand computer screens.

468
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,479
Launch your whole career.

469
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,196
You think?

470
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,227
You crack me up.

471
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:24,234
It's a good wardrobe
for you, Jen.

472
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:38,165
Wait! No! There was
somebody else in the hall!

473
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:43,378
Come on.

474
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:55,390
Come on, lover boy.

475
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:57,017
-Whoa!
-Aah!

476
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:00,270
What are you doing,
you big perv?

477
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:03,732
They're exploring the house
of a mass murderer--live.

478
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:04,942
You want to watch?

479
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:06,902
-No way.
-Sure.

480
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:08,612
Oh, OK.

481
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:10,322
Impulse control disorder.

482
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,115
Huh?

483
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:14,993
That's my theory.

484
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:18,872
I think Michael Myers
had fits of rage...

485
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:21,458
that he could not control.

486
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:27,422
Kind of like a klepto
or a nympho or a pyro.

487
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:32,761
So, instead of
stealing silverware...

488
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:36,223
he slashes the necks
of teenage girls, huh?

489
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:38,809
Oh, come on...

490
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:42,312
haven't you ever had an impulse
that you could not control?

491
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:45,816
-Continuously.
-You mean continually.

492
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:49,319
"Continuous" means
continuing uninterrupted...

493
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:52,406
while "continual" means
reoccurring periodically.

494
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:55,325
Donna, when are you gonna
get out of your head...

495
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:56,785
and start thinking
with your body?

496
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:58,912
Please.

497
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:00,497
Does that line
ever actually work...

498
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:02,249
on the chicks
in the music department?

499
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:06,003
Art history, too.
Sometimes even poli sci.

500
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:08,672
Well, it doesn't cut it
with critical studies.

501
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:09,923
Bummer.

502
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:15,888
Besides,
screwing a music major...

503
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:19,224
would be tantamount
to lesbianism.

504
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:20,809
I could get into that.

505
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:30,569
Sara, I'm telling you,
it's in the food.

506
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:32,321
Remember that guy
who was on trial...

507
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:33,822
for murder in San Francisco?

508
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:35,324
All he ate was Twinkies.

509
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:38,744
Rudy, do you ever think about
anything other than food?

510
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:40,495
Wouldn't you like to know?

511
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,708
Jen?

512
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,090
Jen?

513
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:53,300
What's going on?

514
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:54,718
-What happened?
-I don't know.

515
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,470
I turned my back for a second
and she was gone.

516
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:57,721
Jen!

517
00:43:57,804 --> 00:43:59,389
Jen?

518
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:06,730
Jen?

519
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:09,399
Jen.

520
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,070
Jen?

521
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:20,786
Jen?

522
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:25,249
Jen?

523
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:31,880
Turn it down!

524
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:35,008
-Gotcha!
-God, you bitch.

525
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:36,260
Slut!

526
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:39,847
That's not right, OK?
You're foul.

527
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,890
Uhh, so foul.

528
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:46,687
This is to us,
for successfully--

529
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:48,397
let me give you
a little more--

530
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,399
puttin' together
something collectively...

531
00:44:50,482 --> 00:44:53,527
so ingenious
as a team and a duo...

532
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,863
that we should definitely
be able to secure...

533
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:57,906
a lot of food on the table
for ourselves...

534
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,242
as long as everything
goes as nicely...

535
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:01,743
as it's goin' right now.

536
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:11,795
I'm gonna get her back
for that.

537
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:13,046
Watch me.

538
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:17,718
Oh, my God!

539
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:19,386
Cheers.

540
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:27,060
Oh, no! No!

541
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:31,398
Mm. Mm.

542
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:32,941
Wait, what just happened?

543
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:36,403
-We just lost Bill's camera.
-Oh, shit.

544
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:39,323
He must've dropped it.
Fucking idiot.

545
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:40,991
Find another view quickly,
please.

546
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:42,910
Freddie, relax.

547
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:44,870
I think
this is going really well.

548
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:46,872
-Really, baby?
-Yes.

549
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:48,540
We are doing our thing.

550
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:49,750
OK.

551
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,127
To Dangertainment.

552
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:55,130
Salute. Heh heh heh.

553
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:59,468
And this must be the bed
where he was conceived.

554
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,762
Stop showing off, Jen.

555
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:29,665
Aaaah!

556
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:31,166
Aaaah!

557
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,043
Rudy!

558
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,962
-Sara!
-Jen, help me!

559
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:36,213
Are you OK?

560
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:42,177
Rudy, help. Sara!

561
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:45,514
Ewww.

562
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:47,850
-God.
-What happened?

563
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:50,227
What is that thing?

564
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:59,987
Hey, is this
that Michael Myers thing?

565
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:01,363
Yeah.

566
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:03,782
A'ight, cool.

567
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:07,286
Yeah, OK.

568
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:19,089
What is this?

569
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:28,307
Oh. Sorry.

570
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,225
Are you?

571
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:32,603
You're such a Lothario.

572
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:34,479
Um...

573
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:37,441
I don't know what that
means exactly, but...

574
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:39,026
Just go with it.

575
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:42,988
Hold on.
I just thought of something.

576
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:47,117
Hold on?

577
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:49,203
You've got to be kidding me.

578
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:52,456
What, are you
looking for "Playboys"?

579
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:02,174
This ain't right.

580
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:05,802
Well, it's obvious
that the boy was subject...

581
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:09,389
to emotional and physical abuse.

582
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:12,226
No, all of this.
It's not right.

583
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:14,228
It's too easy.

584
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:17,272
Why is all this stuff
still here?

585
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:19,775
Answer that, Nancy Drew.

586
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:22,778
Where's Bill?

587
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:25,280
He's probably
still mad at me.

588
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:29,785
He's gonna jump out
of somewhere and scare me.

589
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:31,328
You watch.

590
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:36,083
You watch.

591
00:49:00,607 --> 00:49:04,528
Jim? Uh.

592
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:20,919
You know, if I'm keeping you
from something...

593
00:49:21,003 --> 00:49:22,254
just let me know.

594
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:23,630
Look.

595
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:33,390
-Voilà.
-Clever boy.

596
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:46,028
See,
they're looking for clues.

597
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:49,239
Something that might explain
why Michael Myers went bad.

598
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:51,491
-Oh.
-Jeez.

599
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,035
Hey, Scott. What's up?

600
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:55,495
God, nice costume.

601
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:26,401
Whoa.

602
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:33,408
Hey, you think
they kept him down here?

603
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,745
Maybe. Look at this.

604
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:40,791
What? What is it?

605
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,335
It's some sort
of weird harness.

606
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:48,632
This whole place looks like
some sadistic playpen.

607
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:54,263
Ah ha ha.

608
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:57,391
And you know what
that makes me think?

609
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:58,767
What?

610
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:02,437
There's definitely
no cameras down here.

611
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:32,134
I could be a camera.

612
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:39,600
Say something smart.

613
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:43,478
Existence precedes essence.

614
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:52,321
God, you are sexy.

615
00:52:13,884 --> 00:52:18,472
Whoa! Oh, shit!

616
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:27,147
That worked perfectly!

617
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:30,067
Whoa! That is
what I'm talking about.

618
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,321
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! All his victims!

619
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:37,199
It's a mass grave!

620
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:38,617
Oh, my God!

621
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:45,541
Oh, God.

622
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:48,710
All of his victims. Oh!

623
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:52,923
Shit. Look at this.

624
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:55,050
I don't
fucking believe this.

625
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:56,552
What?

626
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:59,388
Made in fucking Taiwan.

627
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:09,917
Oh, shit, man!

628
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:12,002
Charley,
where the fuck you been?

629
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:14,755
We've been lookin' all over
this motherfucker for you!

630
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:17,007
And why the hell are you
dressed like me anyway?

631
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,967
I ain't payin' you
to be Michael Myers.

632
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:20,761
I'm playin' Michael Myers!

633
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:22,387
If them kids come around...

634
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:24,348
and see us dressed up
in the same shit...

635
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:27,809
you'll ruin the whole effect,
God damn it.

636
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:30,187
What the hell
is wrong with you?

637
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:33,148
What you lookin' at me
like that for?

638
00:54:33,232 --> 00:54:35,776
Huh? You don't get it?

639
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:37,986
Your shit ain't workin'
up there?

640
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:41,240
Take your ass in the back
of the garage with Nora.

641
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:42,574
That's your job.

642
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:45,369
Go back there with Nora
and help her ass out.

643
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:46,620
Go do your job.

644
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:50,249
I left the back door
unlocked for your ass...

645
00:54:50,332 --> 00:54:53,252
to go out the back
into the garage.

646
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:54,503
That's what I did.

647
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:57,297
You need to get the hell
outta here.

648
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:59,341
Go on, scoot! Skedaddle!

649
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:01,510
Get the fuck out of Dodge!

650
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:11,770
God damn. What the hell's
somebody gotta do...

651
00:55:11,854 --> 00:55:14,189
to get a little decent help
up in this motherfucker?

652
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:16,483
God damn it. Come on.

653
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:18,861
Let's go find Freddie.

654
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:24,741
This is bullshit.

655
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,010
Hey, Jim?

656
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:48,348
You gotta see this.

657
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:38,607
Gross.

658
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:44,571
Hey, Freddie.

659
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:47,115
Is this all part of the setup?

660
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,426
"Laurie Strode,
sister of Michael Myers...

661
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:09,137
"survives Halloween night
massacre."

662
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:23,569
Heh. Nice prop.

663
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:26,363
Aah!

664
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,116
Oh, my God!

665
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:34,538
Oh, my God!

666
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:36,832
Is anybody else seeing this?

667
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,170
Jim?

668
00:57:45,924 --> 00:57:47,342
Aaah!

669
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:50,137
Aaah!

670
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:54,349
Aah! Oh, my God!

671
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:56,018
No!

672
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:04,318
Help! Somebody!

673
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:06,987
Someone help! Oh, my God!

674
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:10,324
This isn't funny anymore!

675
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:15,495
Help me! Somebody help!

676
00:58:15,621 --> 00:58:16,705
This is not funny!

677
00:58:22,044 --> 00:58:23,921
Oh, my God!

678
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:26,548
Stay away from me! Aah!

679
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:31,345
Aah! Aah!

680
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:33,430
Aah!

681
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:39,061
Aah!

682
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:07,047
That was so fake.

683
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,799
No, no, wait.
Wait, you guys.

684
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:12,135
That really happened.
She was just killed.

685
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:16,640
Man, you're gullible.

686
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:18,183
Get outta here.

687
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,861
It's a good thing
there's no cameras in here.

688
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:33,365
We're wearing cameras.

689
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:38,620
Whoosh.

690
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,320
Aaaah!

691
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:13,614
Michael's here!

692
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,782
I saw him!
He's in the house!

693
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:17,409
He's here!

694
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,870
Oh, my God.

695
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:22,372
What's going on?
What you talking about?

696
01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:23,707
Don't do this, girl.

697
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,667
You're bringing me down
on this beautiful evening.

698
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:28,253
There's nobody here.
You're just bugging out.

699
01:00:28,337 --> 01:00:29,546
It's not funny, OK?

700
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:32,132
-Stop it, OK?
-He's down in that room.

701
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:36,136
There is 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 people in the house.

702
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:38,347
There's no Michael Myers here.
There's nobody.

703
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,974
Listen,
I saw him right over there.

704
01:00:41,058 --> 01:00:43,310
He's in here?
Ooh. Michael Myers.

705
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:44,478
Where's Michael Myers?

706
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:46,438
Michael Myers!
I don't see nothing.

707
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:49,149
-He was in here.
-You're bringing me down.

708
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:51,318
Rudy, I saw--Aaaah!

709
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:53,153
Rudy!

710
01:00:53,195 --> 01:00:56,240
Uhh! Uhh!

711
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:58,075
-Fucker!
-Whoa, whoa!

712
01:00:58,158 --> 01:01:00,661
Turn off the cameras!

713
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:03,080
-Get it back online.
-What's wrong?

714
01:01:03,205 --> 01:01:04,748
Cut to
a different camera angle.

715
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:08,502
It's me. Freddie.

716
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:11,046
Freddie.
What the fuck are you doing?

717
01:01:11,129 --> 01:01:12,714
Damn, man, you hit me...

718
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:15,509
like I murdered
your fuckin' mother.

719
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:17,135
Relax, man.

720
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:19,555
I'm only tryin'
to give America a good show.

721
01:01:19,638 --> 01:01:22,391
So none of
this shit is real, right?

722
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:23,767
Like the furniture...

723
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:26,019
the photos,
all the fucked up toys?

724
01:01:26,103 --> 01:01:27,896
It's all fake.
We've been set up.

725
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,107
You knew you didn't have
a show anyone would watch...

726
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:32,609
so you set us all up
at our fucking expense, huh?

727
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:34,653
What expense
are you talkin' about?

728
01:01:34,736 --> 01:01:37,447
You ain't contributed a dime
to settin' up this shit.

729
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:40,075
Besides, don't nobody
want to see any of y'all...

730
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,869
runnin' around
no empty house...

731
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:44,413
possibly comin' up
with nothing any-damn-way.

732
01:01:44,496 --> 01:01:46,790
America don't like reality,
first of all.

733
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:50,043
Second of all,
they think the shit is boring.

734
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:52,379
They want
a little razzle-dazzle...

735
01:01:52,421 --> 01:01:55,299
a little pizazz,
a little thrill in their life.

736
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:57,176
And us being the ones
that give it to 'em--

737
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:59,219
I don't see
nothin' wrong with that.

738
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:01,388
I did not sign up for this.

739
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,724
Y'all need to do me a favor,
all right?

740
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:07,186
Go along with this shit.
Don't blow it. Not now.

741
01:02:07,269 --> 01:02:09,313
You really have no idea...

742
01:02:09,438 --> 01:02:11,231
of how nicely
I worked things out...

743
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:12,900
so that we all can receive...

744
01:02:12,983 --> 01:02:16,111
somewhat of a robust back end
when this shit is all over.

745
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:18,739
I don't know what you want to do
about your share...

746
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,699
but please
don't fuck it up for me.

747
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:22,910
I want my money, a'ight?

748
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:25,829
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go...

749
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:28,165
scare the shit out of some more
of these motherfuckers...

750
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:31,084
so, I'm gonna get it crackin'.

751
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,462
Y'all do what
the fuck y'all gotta do.

752
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:36,089
See y'all. Ha ha ha ha!

753
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:38,675
-All right.
-We have it.

754
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:41,011
-Turn up the sound.
-Where'd everybody go?

755
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:04,368
Ohh.

756
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:07,454
There you are, Bill.

757
01:03:07,496 --> 01:03:10,165
So what
do you guys want to do?

758
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:13,335
I don't know.
I could use the money.

759
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:16,713
No. Fuck that.
I'm out.

760
01:03:16,839 --> 01:03:18,215
Me too. I quit.

761
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:24,221
Boo!

762
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:30,811
She must be going
for the first internet Emmy.

763
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,857
You can't scare us, Jen.

764
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,233
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

765
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:44,741
You too, Freddie.

766
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:52,040
Aaaaaaah!

767
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:04,469
-Eww!
-How'd they do that?

768
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:07,472
-Digital effects.
-No, it isn't!

769
01:04:09,057 --> 01:04:10,184
Hello. 911?

770
01:04:12,978 --> 01:04:15,147
Oh, my God.

771
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:21,820
-It's locked!
-Fuck.

772
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:24,531
Go in there!
Go in there now!

773
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:46,553
Jim, run! Run!

774
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:48,305
Ah!

775
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:51,391
Oh! Aah!

776
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,402
Uhh.

777
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:25,926
Hey, Michael!
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

778
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:27,970
You want a piece of me?

779
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:48,073
You should try a little less
protein in your diet.

780
01:05:48,156 --> 01:05:50,284
Control some
of that aggression, huh?

781
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:10,429
Want some of this, huh?

782
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,099
I know what 911 is for!

783
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:16,226
This is an emergency.
It's not a hoax.

784
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:21,773
Motherfucker, come on.
Trying to fucking kill me?

785
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:24,401
Come on!
You like sushi, motherfucker?!

786
01:06:24,443 --> 01:06:27,571
You gonna fucking kill me?

787
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:28,906
Oh, shit.

788
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:27,047
Somebody...

789
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,966
somebody out there,
please help us.

790
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:31,677
Somebody, please help us.

791
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:34,721
She really is
a very talented actress.

792
01:07:48,443 --> 01:07:50,237
Deckard.

793
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,698
Deckard, if you're there,
please let me know.

794
01:07:53,991 --> 01:07:56,577
Who's Deckard?
Myles is Deckard.

795
01:07:56,618 --> 01:07:57,744
What do you mean?

796
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:08,005
Deckard,
he's killing all of us.

797
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:09,381
He's killing us.

798
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:10,591
There he is!
Upper right!

799
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:12,926
-Zoom in!
-Go to the other camera.

800
01:08:12,968 --> 01:08:14,469
Tell her
he's coming up the stairs.

801
01:08:14,553 --> 01:08:17,389
This isn't funny anymore!
Do something!

802
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:37,784
Aah!

803
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:43,290
-He heard her!
-Oh, my God.

804
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:47,544
He's at the door!

805
01:08:47,628 --> 01:08:49,213
Get her out!

806
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:23,539
Oh, my God.

807
01:09:23,664 --> 01:09:25,666
-No!
-It's too high!

808
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:39,680
No!

809
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:48,730
Aaah!

810
01:10:00,075 --> 01:10:01,910
I can't see you!

811
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:16,717
Deckard, where is he?

812
01:10:40,157 --> 01:10:41,283
Tell her to go!

813
01:10:41,366 --> 01:10:43,410
-Now's her chance.
-Come on, go!

814
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:32,459
My God. Everybody's dead.

815
01:11:32,543 --> 01:11:35,003
Where is he?

816
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:37,047
I don't know.

817
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:41,093
We got to get the fuck
outta here now.

818
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:42,803
Come on. Let's go.

819
01:12:02,531 --> 01:12:04,533
Oh, shit.

820
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:06,451
Aaah!

821
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:23,343
So, you want to be
on Dangertainment?

822
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:27,389
Let's see what you got.

823
01:12:27,431 --> 01:12:29,141
Waa--hyah!

824
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:36,982
Hyah!

825
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:51,330
Aah!

826
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:54,708
Yo, Mike, come see me.

827
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:58,128
Michael, come and see me!
Look at me!

828
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:05,302
You wanna fuck with me, huh?

829
01:13:05,344 --> 01:13:07,304
You motherfucker.

830
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:08,972
Haaa-yah!

831
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:45,759
Let's get outta here.
Come on.

832
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:47,594
You all right?

833
01:13:47,678 --> 01:13:50,514
I saw his room.

834
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:53,308
He's been living underneath
this fucking house...

835
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:54,977
for who knows how long.

836
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:56,979
Probably the last 20 years.

837
01:13:57,062 --> 01:13:58,355
Come on.

838
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:05,445
I swear on my soul...

839
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:07,948
I had no idea.

840
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:09,908
I swear.

841
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:18,500
Aw, shit.

842
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:20,544
Come on. Let's go.

843
01:14:23,755 --> 01:14:26,341
Oh, my God.
He cut the cable.

844
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:29,052
Where the fuck is he?

845
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:32,472
This is bad.

846
01:14:34,183 --> 01:14:38,437
Deckard, where is he?

847
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:50,741
-No!
-Run! Oh!

848
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:06,507
Aah!

849
01:15:10,052 --> 01:15:11,345
No.

850
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,101
Uhh.

851
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,981
Oh, no.

852
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:31,425
Aaaah!

853
01:16:32,509 --> 01:16:34,303
Uhh!

854
01:16:56,074 --> 01:16:57,868
Aah!

855
01:16:57,951 --> 01:16:59,786
Aah!

856
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:14,468
Uhh.

857
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,063
You bastard!

858
01:18:08,146 --> 01:18:10,440
This is for Jen!

859
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:13,527
This is for Rudy!

860
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:19,032
For all of them!

861
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:32,462
Oh, shit.

862
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:39,094
Aah!

863
01:18:44,224 --> 01:18:46,476
Aah!

864
01:19:53,418 --> 01:19:56,672
Trick or treat, motherfucker.

865
01:19:59,716 --> 01:20:01,301
Aaaah!

866
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:14,481
No!

867
01:20:15,649 --> 01:20:17,192
No!

868
01:20:17,234 --> 01:20:18,402
Aah!

869
01:20:35,127 --> 01:20:36,753
Uhh!

870
01:20:36,837 --> 01:20:37,963
Aaah!

871
01:20:38,046 --> 01:20:39,631
Ohh!

872
01:20:52,853 --> 01:20:56,565
Burn, motherfucker! Burn!

873
01:20:58,317 --> 01:21:00,277
Sara!

874
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:04,239
Come on, come on!

875
01:21:04,364 --> 01:21:05,532
Uhh!

876
01:21:05,616 --> 01:21:09,036
Hey, Mikey!
Happy fucking Halloween!

877
01:21:58,919 --> 01:22:01,672
Sara? Sara Moyer?

878
01:22:01,755 --> 01:22:04,675
-Sara?
-Can we get a statement?

879
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:06,260
Hey, we can go live now.

880
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:08,512
What happened
with Michael Myers?

881
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:12,057
Thank you, Deckard.
You saved my life.

882
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:22,401
What's it feel like
to be a hero, Sara?

883
01:22:22,484 --> 01:22:24,194
How does it feel now
that it's all over?

884
01:22:24,278 --> 01:22:26,196
What makes you so sure
it's over?

885
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,489
Excuse me.

886
01:22:27,573 --> 01:22:29,783
-Watch the camera!
-No more cameras!

887
01:22:29,825 --> 01:22:32,369
Dangertainment
is off the air.

888
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:34,288
Why don't
y'all show some respect?

889
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:36,206
Mr. Harris, would you like
to make a statement?

890
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:38,041
What can you tell us
about Michael Myers?

891
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:40,711
Michael Myers
is not a sound bite...

892
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:45,340
a spin-off, a tie-in,
some celebrity scandal.

893
01:22:45,465 --> 01:22:50,637
Michael Myers is a killer shark
in baggy-ass overalls...

894
01:22:50,721 --> 01:22:52,472
that gets his kicks
off of killing...

895
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:55,017
everything and everyone
that he comes across.

896
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,019
That's all.

897
01:22:57,102 --> 01:22:59,479
We're done dancing
for these cameras.

898
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:01,023
Let's get outta here, Sara.

899
01:23:01,064 --> 01:23:03,942
But how are you
feeling right now?

900
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:05,819
Heh.

901
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:07,070
How am I feelin' now?

902
01:23:07,154 --> 01:23:09,907
You wanna know how
I'm feelin' right now?

903
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:11,241
Feel this!

904
01:23:11,325 --> 01:23:13,493
My camera!

905
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:25,130
That's him, isn't it?

906
01:23:25,214 --> 01:23:27,257
I want to see his face.

907
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:32,304
I want to warn you, ma'am,
it's not a pretty sight.

908
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,559
All right.

909
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:47,861
Come on, back it off.
Let's go.

910
01:23:47,945 --> 01:23:49,238
Wow.

911
01:23:49,321 --> 01:23:51,865
You're lookin' a little crispy
over there, Mikey.

912
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:54,701
Like some chicken-fried
motherfucker.

913
01:23:54,785 --> 01:23:59,456
Well, may he never,
ever rest in peace.

914
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:11,468
Hey, how's it going?

915
01:24:11,552 --> 01:24:13,387
You've gotta be kidding me.

916
01:24:13,428 --> 01:24:14,847
Another one?

917
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,348
It's your lucky night.

918
01:24:16,431 --> 01:24:17,766
You got a celebrity.

919
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:20,853
Ooh, let me get
my autograph book.

920
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:24,106
I'm not kidding.
It's Michael Myers.

921
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:25,399
What?

922
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:31,446
Get me a copy
of that autograph.

923
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:32,948
-Yeah, sure.
-Ha ha!

924
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:34,533
It's cracking me up.

925
01:24:35,305 --> 01:25:35,524
