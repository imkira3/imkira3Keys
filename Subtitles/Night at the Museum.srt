2
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,241
Hey, watch it.

3
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:36,446
Oh, come on.

4
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:45,948
Hey, Mike!

5
00:03:46,157 --> 00:03:48,767
-Hey, Larry.
-How you doing?

6
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:50,124
Have you seen Nicky?

7
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,839
I'm pretty sure he went with Erica.
It was half day today.

8
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:55,240
Parent Career Day.

9
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:03,593
-Hey.
-Hey. Come on in.

10
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:07,873
-You all right?
-Yeah, yeah.

11
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,275
Why didn't anybody tell me
it was Career Day?

12
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,991
What do you mean?
Nicky said he was gonna tell you.

13
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,749
Oh, okay, I guess he forgot.

14
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,255
There he is. How are you, Larry?

15
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:21,447
Good. How are you doing, Don?

16
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:23,744
Good.

17
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:26,667
Can you believe this weather?

18
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,618
Chilly, right? Chilly, chilly,
Chilly Willy the penguin.

19
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:38,152
Leave me alone. Hey, why don't I go tell
the little corncob you're here.

20
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,493
Great. Great, that's great.
Yeah, thanks.

21
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:46,296
Wow, your fiance really manages
to squeeze a lot onto that belt.

22
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:47,862
-Stop it.
-What?

23
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:50,995
What? No, it's like he's...

24
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,770
...the Batman of stockbrokers.

25
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,902
-Bond trader.
-Bond trader. Sorry.

26
00:04:56,111 --> 00:05:00,496
Hey, how's it going with that virtual-reality
driving range that you wanted to open?

27
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,732
Getting there, still waiting for
the technology to catch up.

28
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:06,134
It's not easy,
there are a lot of moving parts.

29
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:10,728
Hey, do you think Nick
would like Queens?

30
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,592
Oh, no, Larry.
You didn't get evicted again, did you?

31
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,679
I didn't...

32
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:19,811
...get evicted. I didn't get evicted, no.
I mean, I didn't....

33
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,047
-No, I didn't get evicted yet. It's like--
-Larry, listen to me.

34
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,136
I don't know how much more
Nicky can take.

35
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,955
Every couple months, it's a new career,
a new apartment.

36
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,401
If it wasn't for Nicky, I wouldn't
say anything, I would stay out of it.

37
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:34,220
It's just, it's too much instability.
It's not good for him.

38
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:37,018
I'm trying to figure things out
right now, okay?

39
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:43,199
You know...

40
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,853
...I don't think that Nicky
should stay with you.

41
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:50,611
-What?
-Just until you get really settled.

42
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:53,096
Hey, Dad.

43
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:56,290
-Hey, ready to carve it up?
-Cool.

44
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:04,916
All right, good!
Take it, Nicky! Break away!

45
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:11,702
-What are you doing?
-Hey, Nicky! Are you all right?

46
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,192
-You okay?
-I'm fine. Would you get off the ice?

47
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,802
Listen. Their left defenseman
is a very weak skater.

48
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,830
So you go left side, you got
a clear shot at the goal. Okay?

49
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,231
-Cool, thanks.
-All right, man.

50
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:29,951
We're good here. We're good.
All right. As you were, skaters.

51
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:31,282
Game on!

52
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:34,996
I'm good.

53
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:37,505
I'm telling you,
you tore it up out there today.

54
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:40,115
Thinking the NHL
is a serious possibility.

55
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:43,665
I don't really wanna be
a hockey player anymore.

56
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:49,289
-All right. What do you wanna be?
-A bond trader.

57
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:51,378
A bond trader?

58
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:55,449
Yeah, it's what Don does.
He took me to his office last week.

59
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:57,642
That's cool.

60
00:06:57,746 --> 00:07:00,461
So you wanna dress up
in a monkey suit and tie every day?

61
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:03,489
Like an automaton robot?

62
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:07,352
Trust me, you can't play hockey
in a cubicle. Kind of awkward.

63
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,857
Well, he's got a pretty big office.

64
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:12,990
That's not the point.
Come on, you love hockey.

65
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:16,227
I still like it,
but bond trading's my fallback.

66
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,211
Your fallback?

67
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:21,134
Wait a minute. You're too young
to have a fallback, okay?

68
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,266
And also, where did you ever
even hear that word?

69
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:27,503
Mom was talking to Don
about all your different schemes.

70
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:28,965
She called them schemes?

71
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:32,097
She said it was time
you found a fallback.

72
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:37,735
Are you really moving again?

73
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:43,164
I don't know. We'll see. I mean...

74
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:45,774
...there's some pretty cool places
out in Queens.

75
00:07:45,878 --> 00:07:48,488
-Yeah.
-Hey.

76
00:07:48,697 --> 00:07:51,413
Hey, Nicky, look at me.

77
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:53,823
Look at me, man.
I wanna tell you something.

78
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:57,268
I know that things have been kind of
up and down for me lately...

79
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,252
...and that's been hard for you.

80
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,280
But I really feel like my moment's coming
and when it does...

81
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:05,516
...everything's just gonna come together,
you know?

82
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:06,978
What if you're wrong...

83
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:10,737
...and you're just an ordinary guy
who should get a job?

84
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,776
All right, well....

85
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,101
You know what,
we'll figure it out, okay?

86
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,278
All right? Come on,
let's get you back to Mom's.

87
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:38,532
Mr. Daley, I can honestly say,
in 43 years at this agency...

88
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,455
...I've never seen a resume
quite like yours.

89
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:43,752
All right.

90
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:47,510
That wasn't a compliment.

91
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:50,016
It says here you were the CEO...

92
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:52,731
...of Snaptime lndustries.

93
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,401
Care to elaborate on that?

94
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,517
Sure. Well, that was the umbrella
corporation for my invention, the Snapper.

95
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:03,277
You know, you snap, the lights come on.
Snap, they come off.

96
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:06,096
Didn't they already make that?

97
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:11,003
No, no, that's the Clapper,
which, obviously...

98
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:12,778
...stole a bit of our thunder.

99
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:16,432
Personally, I don't really see
what the big difference is, I mean:

100
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:18,938
You know, whatever, but...

101
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,625
...apparently there is a significant portion
of the population that has trouble actually...

102
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,903
-...snapping.
-Clapping's easier.

103
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,827
Debatable.

104
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:33,209
I can't help you.

105
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,103
Debbie?

106
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:36,982
Can I call you Debbie? Because...

107
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:39,489
...I felt a connection
when I entered this office...

108
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:41,995
...and I don't know,
I feel like you did too.

109
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:44,527
I didn't feel a connection.

110
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:48,694
Look.

111
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:53,801
I need a job tomorrow, okay?

112
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,889
If I don't have one....

113
00:09:56,516 --> 00:09:58,813
Well, I just need it, okay?

114
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:01,318
Well, I don't know.

115
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:03,929
I might have one thing.

116
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:08,627
They've turned down everyone
I've sent over there, but--

117
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:10,297
Great.

118
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,490
--who knows?

119
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,414
You might get lucky.

120
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:51,753
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hi.

121
00:10:51,962 --> 00:10:56,555
I'm Larry Daley. I've got a job interview
with Cecil Fredricks.

122
00:10:57,077 --> 00:11:00,210
-Right. He should still be in his office.
-Great.

123
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:03,864
-I'm Rebecca Hutman. I'm a docent here.
-Hi.

124
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:07,309
-Let me point you in the right direction.
-Great.

125
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:10,859
Teddy Roosevelt, right?

126
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:14,722
-Yes, a great visionary.
-Yes, definitely.

127
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:16,915
He was our 4th president, right?

128
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,316
-Twenty-sixth.
-Twenty-sixth.

129
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,448
Please don't touch the exhibits!
I mean....

130
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:24,014
Riffraff.

131
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:27,461
Miss Hutman.
I cannot tolerate this type of chaos.

132
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:30,802
I mean, this is a museum, not a....

133
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:34,142
Do you know what "museum" means?

134
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:38,841
It doesn't mean,
"Daddy, it's a big Tyrannosaurus thing.

135
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:41,555
Can I touch its leg? " No!

136
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,748
Work it out, please.

137
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:46,671
-Will do, sir.
-Thank you.

138
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:49,281
Dr. McPhee, the museum director.

139
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,265
Seems like a fun guy.

140
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:54,302
Control your young, please. Can we?

141
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:09,128
Hello? Just kidding.

142
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:12,991
Hi. I'm Larry Daley.
Are you Mr. Fredricks?

143
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,288
Mr. Fredricks was my father.

144
00:12:15,497 --> 00:12:18,838
I am Cecil. Good to meet you, Larry.
Nice firm handshake.

145
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:22,492
I like that. Tells a lot about a man.
Come on in.

146
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:29,801
Let's talk turkey here.

147
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,334
The museum is losing money,
hand over fist.

148
00:12:35,543 --> 00:12:39,824
I guess kids today don't care about
wax figures or stuffed animals.

149
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:44,001
So they're downsizing,
which is code for firing...

150
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:46,089
...myself and the other two night guards.

151
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:48,595
They want to replace us
with one new guard.

152
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:52,353
-Oh, sorry.
-Well, what are you gonna do?

153
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,007
I'd like you to meet
my two colleagues here.

154
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:58,617
Reginald? Gus?

155
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:01,436
Where is he? I'll beat him with my fist!

156
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,866
Gus, this is Larry Daley, the kid who
wants to be the new night guard.

157
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,580
Night guard?

158
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,921
No, the lady at the agency said
this was a museum position.

159
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,263
Most important position
in the museum, Larry.

160
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,247
He looks like a weirdie.

161
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:21,379
Wonderful guard, terrible people skills.

162
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:24,929
Now, listen, lunch box.
Don't try anything funny.

163
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:28,270
I once went nine rounds
with John L. Sullivan.

164
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:31,193
You never fought John L. Sullivan
in your life.

165
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:34,012
Gentlemen, we have
a job candidate here.

166
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:36,727
He's got an excellent resume,
a winning attitude...

167
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:39,232
...and I say let's give him a shot.
What do you say?

168
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:43,513
Hang on a sec. I think I might wanna
have a little time just to think it over.

169
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,958
Do you want the job or not, snack shack?

170
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,224
-No, no, I want the job--
-Welcome to the night guards, Larry.

171
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:56,251
Larry, meet me up on the second floor.

172
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,219
I'll slip into my orthopedics and
give you a little tour. Arthritic knees.

173
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:04,395
Not fun getting old, my friend. Go on.

174
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:12,747
You really think he's the one?

175
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:15,880
Oh, yes.

176
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,968
He's the one.

177
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:35,196
Gotta keep it moving, Larry.
I'm pretty spry for an old man.

178
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:38,537
This is the Diorama Room.

179
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,729
Oh, yeah.

180
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:45,949
I remember these little guys. Cute.

181
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:50,230
Cecil!

182
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:55,137
Hey, Cecil!

183
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:10,903
-Did I get you good?
-Yeah.

184
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:13,409
You got me.

185
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:21,866
Seriously, though, no fooling around
in here. This stuff is really old.

186
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:27,086
All right, then. As you can see,
it's pretty quiet in here these days.

187
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,949
On the left there is your Attila the Hun.

188
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,439
And here we have our Easter lsland head.

189
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:38,884
Hey, Cecil.

190
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:45,463
And this, of course,
is the Hall of African Mammals.

191
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,968
Ah, yes.

192
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:52,458
Monkeys. I love monkeys.

193
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,590
-Yeah.
-Guy's cute.

194
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,557
Yeah, we call him Dexter.
He's quite a little...

195
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:02,481
...ball of fun, aren't you, Dexter?

196
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:06,866
Moving on.

197
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:13,861
And, finally, this is the temple
of the Pharaoh Ahkmenrah.

198
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:20,857
And in that tomb right down there,
the pharaoh himself.

199
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:22,319
Neat.

200
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:24,720
And hanging on the wall behind him...

201
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:30,148
...was his most prized possession,
the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

202
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:33,817
Twenty-four-carat gold.
It's worth a fortune.

203
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:35,696
Very cool.

204
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,471
It is indeed, Larry.

205
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,499
Very cool.

206
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:48,747
All right. Report here at 5 tomorrow.
We'll walk you through your duties.

207
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:50,730
Okay, 5. I'll be here.

208
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:52,819
Moving on.

209
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:57,413
Hey, it's me. So I got a job.

210
00:16:57,622 --> 00:16:59,919
Larry, that's great. What is it?

211
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:03,260
It's a job...

212
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:06,706
...at the Museum of Natural History.

213
00:17:06,914 --> 00:17:09,524
Yeah, so you can tell Nicky
that we won't be moving.

214
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:10,882
Larry, this is good news.

215
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:13,805
Yeah, no, definitely.
So I'll see you tomorrow?

216
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,415
-Okay.
-Okay, bye.

217
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,169
Larry?

218
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:30,302
Your keys. Your torch.

219
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:33,330
-Right.
-You'll wanna strap those to your belt.

220
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,731
It can get a little spooky
around here at night...

221
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,341
...so you might wanna
put a few lights on.

222
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:42,413
All right, flashlight, keys.
What am I for--?

223
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:47,007
The instruction manual.

224
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:48,364
Instructions.

225
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:51,810
You start with one, two, three....

226
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:53,376
Four?

227
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,255
Are you cracking wise?

228
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:58,387
I ought to punch you
in the nose, hopscotch.

229
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:01,519
Leave him alone, Gus.
You got it covered, right, Larry?

230
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:03,816
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

231
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:06,428
-You better get it!
-Gus.

232
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:10,082
Larry, do them in order,
do them all and do them quick.

233
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:15,511
And the most important thing of all
to remember: Don't let anything in or out.

234
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:16,868
Out?

235
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:18,747
Good luck, son.

236
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:21,880
-Night, Gus.
-Young buck. Cracking wise.

237
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:23,654
Moving on.

238
00:18:58,231 --> 00:18:59,797
Hello?

239
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:01,781
Hello!

240
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,660
Check!

241
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:06,479
Check.

242
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:10,238
I am Larry.

243
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:14,414
Check! Larry! Larry.

244
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,141
Monday! Monday! Monday!

245
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,960
Monster Truck Rally.

246
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:47,756
Cecil?

247
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:53,707
Okay, very funny, Cecil!

248
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:58,196
What is this, like a
David Copperfield thing?

249
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,638
This is weird.

250
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:19,079
Cecil?

251
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:13,475
Come on. Revolve. Revolve!

252
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,346
-Name, please?
-Cecil...

253
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:33,313
-...Fredricks!
-One moment. Connecting.

254
00:22:33,522 --> 00:22:35,610
-Hello.
-Cecil! It's Larry Daley!

255
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:37,802
Larry. Yes, how can I help you?

256
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:40,621
The dinosaur-- The dinosaur is alive!

257
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,918
I'm having a little trouble
hearing you, friend.

258
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:44,380
Tequila.

259
00:22:44,484 --> 00:22:46,364
The dinosaur's alive!

260
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:47,930
What do I do?
Tell me what to do!

261
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:51,271
Read the instructions.
It explains everything.

262
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:54,925
Okay, I got them!

263
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,058
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Wait! What--?

264
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:09,334
What bone?

265
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:08,752
Fetch?

266
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:14,076
Play fetch?

267
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,029
No way.

268
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:51,359
-Dum-dum.
-Yes?

269
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:54,695
-You give me gum-gum.
-I give you gum-gum?

270
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,828
You new dum-dum.
You give me gum-gum.

271
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,691
Okay, you know what?
I have no gum-gum. Sorry.

272
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:03,779
And my name isn't dum-dum,
my name's Larry.

273
00:25:03,883 --> 00:25:06,493
No, your name dum-dum.

274
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:10,774
Oh, you in trouble, dum-dum.

275
00:25:10,983 --> 00:25:13,802
You'd better run-run
from Attila the Hun-Hun.

276
00:25:17,978 --> 00:25:19,648
See you later, dum-dum.

277
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:57,758
What is happening?

278
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:38,800
Hey.

279
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:41,514
How you doing?

280
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:46,317
Are you...?

281
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,405
You're...

282
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,433
..."Sakagahwahwaya"?

283
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:53,103
You're "Sakagawaya"?

284
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,131
Oh, Sakagawea. You're Sakagawea?

285
00:26:56,758 --> 00:26:59,368
The glass. I can't...

286
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,143
...hear you.

287
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:04,901
You can't...? You can't hear me?

288
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:07,511
Excuse me.
"Who assisted the Lewis and Clark--"

289
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:10,958
Right, so that's Lewis and Clark
and you're.... Right.

290
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,359
You seem-- I'm Larry.

291
00:27:13,985 --> 00:27:17,431
What's going on? What's--?
Do you know what's going on here?

292
00:27:19,728 --> 00:27:21,294
Huns. I gotta--

293
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:09,917
Hey. Hi.

294
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:12,527
Tin Man. Hey. Hi. How you doing?

295
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:15,868
I'm new. It says I'm supposed to
lock up the lions or they'll eat me.

296
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:19,766
You're Galileo? No?

297
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:44,162
Okay....

298
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:45,938
Hey, I'm the....

299
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:51,994
Hi. I'm the new guy
and I'm just locking up, so....

300
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:56,623
If it's cool with you
I'm just gonna get my paperwork...

301
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,565
...and be out of your hair, okay?

302
00:29:56,445 --> 00:30:00,203
"Double-check your belt.
The monkey probably stole your keys."

303
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:02,083
Monkey.

304
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:08,869
Hey. Hey there. Hi.
What's your name? Your name is....

305
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,898
No, no, no. Come back. Come back.

306
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:13,986
Dewey? Is that your name, Dewey?

307
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:18,162
No, no, no. What's--? Dewey?
Dexter? Dexter. Dexter, right?

308
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:20,459
Hey, Dexter,
you wanna give me those keys?

309
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:22,965
I just want to lock up.

310
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:25,262
Yes. Oh, good. Come to Papa.

311
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:30,064
Oh, thank you. Can I have those keys?
Oh, good. What a good boy.

312
00:30:30,273 --> 00:30:32,152
That's okay. Oh, thank you.

313
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:36,224
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
Thank you very, very much.

314
00:30:57,955 --> 00:30:59,834
Bad monkey. Stop that.

315
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:03,071
That's not right. Are you done?

316
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:06,934
Do you have an issue with me?
Do you have an issue with me?

317
00:31:07,142 --> 00:31:10,170
Because if I have a problem with somebody,
I don't pee on them, okay?

318
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:13,616
And also-- Let me tell you something.
These keys?

319
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,957
Hey. Dexter, that's not funny.
Give it back.

320
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:18,940
Dexter. Give--

321
00:31:21,028 --> 00:31:25,206
Don't. I know what you're thinking.
Don't do it. Not a good idea.

322
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,876
Not-- Dexter, I need those.

323
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,844
Don't encourage him. You think
you're funny for your friends, huh?

324
00:31:30,948 --> 00:31:34,080
You three guys-- What, he's the ringleader,
you're the audience?

325
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:35,959
Yeah, no. Don't do it, okay?

326
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:37,734
Lookit-- You!

327
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:52,769
Oh, this is not happening.

328
00:32:01,744 --> 00:32:03,728
Oh, man.

329
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:31,709
What are you guys doing?

330
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:34,319
I can't feel my lip.

331
00:32:35,677 --> 00:32:37,348
Oh, shit.

332
00:32:40,811 --> 00:32:42,083
Man.

333
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:08,791
Hey. Hey.

334
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:12,446
Hey, stop that.

335
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:19,337
Hog-tie him, boys.

336
00:33:20,486 --> 00:33:24,558
-Get him, that big old Bocephus of a man.
-Hey, what are you doing?

337
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:27,063
Cinch him up good.
You ain't so big now, are you?

338
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,256
Hey. Hey, stop that.

339
00:33:33,014 --> 00:33:35,625
Every night, year after year...

340
00:33:35,729 --> 00:33:39,279
...one of you guards
locks us up in these boxes.

341
00:33:39,488 --> 00:33:42,724
Well, I hereby say, sir, enough!

342
00:33:44,395 --> 00:33:46,587
Fire up the iron horse, boys.

343
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,342
-Hey, blondie?
-Name's Jedediah.

344
00:33:57,551 --> 00:33:59,534
All right, Jedediah. Stop the train, please.

345
00:33:59,743 --> 00:34:03,293
-That's a big no-can-do, Cracker Jack.
-What's going on here, huh?

346
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:05,694
-Somebody's gotta pay.
-Pay for what?

347
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:10,706
I don't know. Just pay. Now, stop whining
and just take it like a man.

348
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,970
Seriously, stop the train.

349
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,998
-All right, stop the train.
-Thank you.

350
00:34:20,207 --> 00:34:22,190
Now full speed ahead and ram him!

351
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,175
Split his head like a watermelon!

352
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:28,038
For crying out loud.

353
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:29,709
All right, that's enough.

354
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,736
We got a breach.

355
00:34:40,776 --> 00:34:45,787
I got him. I got him. I got him, guys.
I got him--

356
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:52,791
-Oh, my....
-Prepare the catapults.

357
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,594
Octavius, hold on. This ain't your fight.
This here giant's on our land.

358
00:34:57,698 --> 00:35:00,205
Hey, little guy. Jed? Yeah.

359
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:03,337
Sorry, look. I just-- I'm not a giant.
I'm just an average-sized--

360
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:05,216
Don't talk down to me.

361
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:08,453
I'm not a giant, guys. All right?
You guys are really little.

362
00:35:08,662 --> 00:35:12,942
We may be small,
but our hearts are large...

363
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:15,031
...metaphorically speaking.

364
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,536
Don't take that wrong.
I'm saying you're miniatures.

365
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:20,668
Silence! The Roman Empire
knows no boundaries.

366
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:23,383
-Don't you do it, son.
-Do what?

367
00:35:23,592 --> 00:35:24,949
-Octavius.
-Don't do what?

368
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:28,603
-Unleash hell!
-Don't--

369
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:41,237
Climb aboard, boy.

370
00:35:41,342 --> 00:35:43,430
Take the hand, son.

371
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,084
Onboard.

372
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,618
That's right. You better run, boy.
You hear Jedediah?

373
00:35:52,722 --> 00:35:57,211
That mustachioed horseman ain't always
gonna be there to protect you, you hear me?

374
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,701
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

375
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,789
Theodore Roosevelt,
26th president...

376
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:06,295
...of these United States of America
at your service.

377
00:36:06,817 --> 00:36:11,411
Okay. I'm Larry Daley,
the new night guard.

378
00:36:14,231 --> 00:36:17,467
Pleasure to me you, Lawrence Daley.
You'll have to excuse me, though.

379
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,182
The hunt is afoot.

380
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:23,001
Hunt's afoot.

381
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:27,072
Excuse me, Mr. President.
Could I ask you something?

382
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:29,265
-Yes, but just one question.
-All right.

383
00:36:29,474 --> 00:36:32,710
Okay, why? Is it just some, like,
three-wishes kind of deal, or--?

384
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:37,513
Not at all. Self-reliance
is the key to a vigorous life.

385
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:41,898
A man must look inward to find
his own answers. How can I be of help?

386
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:45,552
I don't really know how to put this,
and please don't take it the wrong way...

387
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:49,312
...but isn't everything in this museum
supposed to be, you know...

388
00:36:49,521 --> 00:36:51,087
-...dead?
-Dead?

389
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:55,054
-Yeah.
-Follow me.

390
00:36:57,977 --> 00:36:59,544
Yell all you want, pharaoh.

391
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:03,720
You've been in there 54 years.
You're not getting out tonight.

392
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:06,748
There's the source of all this commotion.

393
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:10,193
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

394
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:14,996
Arrived here in 1952
from the Nile expedition.

395
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:21,364
On that night,
everything in this museum came to life.

396
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:23,974
And every night since.

397
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:32,015
So everything in the museum
comes to life every night?

398
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,685
Exactly.

399
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:36,817
And I'm supposed to do what?

400
00:37:37,026 --> 00:37:42,142
You're the night watchman, Lawrence.
A venerable position in this institution.

401
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:47,258
-Come on, lad.
-All right. Okay. This is impossible.

402
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:50,181
Nothing's impossible.
If it can be dreamed, it can be done.

403
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,418
Hence the 20-foot jackal staring at you.
Don't make eye contact.

404
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,968
Your job is to make sure that everyone
stays inside the museum...

405
00:37:57,072 --> 00:37:59,787
...because if the sun rises
and anyone's on the outside...

406
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,980
...we turn to dust.

407
00:38:02,502 --> 00:38:04,904
-You turn to dust?
-Dust.

408
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:06,887
-Really?
-Really.

409
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:10,437
Now, it's almost dawn.
I shall help you restore order tonight.

410
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:14,196
But mark my words, it's the last time
I shall ever do so. Is that clear?

411
00:38:15,553 --> 00:38:18,789
Yeah. I mean-- I mean, I guess. I don't....

412
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:21,922
Stop babbling, boy! Yes or no?

413
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,801
-Yes.
-Good.

414
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,993
Let's ride.

415
00:38:36,225 --> 00:38:39,567
All right.
So the Hall of Reptiles is secure.

416
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:49,903
What are you looking at?

417
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,602
I'm tracking, dear boy.

418
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:58,569
Man's got to track.
Welcome to the family, Lawrence.

419
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:01,701
See you tomorrow night.

420
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,625
Actually, I gotta be honest.
I don't think I'm coming back.

421
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:07,026
What? You've only just begun.

422
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:09,636
Yeah, well, this is not exactly what l--

423
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:10,993
-Lawrence?
-Yeah?

424
00:39:11,202 --> 00:39:13,291
What did you do
before you took this post?

425
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,572
Well, I've done a lot of different things.
I invented this thing called the Snapper.

426
00:39:17,781 --> 00:39:19,347
Did you give up on that as well?

427
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:22,792
No, I just hit a few roadblocks.
You might have heard of The Clapper?

428
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:24,149
-Lawrence.
-Yes, sir?

429
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:29,787
Some men are born great.
Others have greatness thrust upon them.

430
00:39:30,205 --> 00:39:33,964
For you, this is that very moment.

431
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,407
Bully. Got you, boy.

432
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:04,973
Yeah. You got me.

433
00:40:08,836 --> 00:40:11,133
Say hello to your little friend.

434
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,683
-What are you doing?
-Put me down.

435
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:16,980
I don't like to be manhandled.

436
00:40:17,188 --> 00:40:20,425
-Just calm down, Jed.
-lt doesn't feel good.

437
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:24,184
-lt makes me feel small and powerless.
-You done?

438
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:28,778
I'm gonna shoot you in your dang eye.
In your dadgum eye.

439
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:31,406
Yeah, keep shooting.
Nothing's gonna happen.

440
00:40:31,615 --> 00:40:34,121
Now you know my shame.

441
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:39,759
Jedediah's impotent rage.
His guns don't fire. Take me away.

442
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:42,473
This ain't over.
You ain't seen the last of me.

443
00:40:42,682 --> 00:40:44,770
I don't wanna hear it, okay?

444
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:45,979
Duck!

445
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,287
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

446
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:54,042
This is not worth 1 1.50 an hour.

447
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:58,343
Look, the giant's scared.
There's a bigger giant running around.

448
00:41:35,608 --> 00:41:37,383
Hello.

449
00:41:37,592 --> 00:41:39,159
Larry?

450
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:42,604
Larry?

451
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:51,165
Oh, don't do that.
We're too old for surprises.

452
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:54,402
Really? I thought you liked surprises.
Like how you surprised me...

453
00:41:54,506 --> 00:41:57,430
...with the fact everything in
the museum comes to life at night.

454
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:59,100
That little sweetheart.

455
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:01,815
We wanted to tell you.
You never would have believed us.

456
00:42:02,024 --> 00:42:04,112
-You have any idea what I've been through?
-What?

457
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,601
-You have any idea what I've been through?
-Keep a lid on it, butterscotch.

458
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:12,360
I don't know if what happened last night
was real, but I didn't sign up for this.

459
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:16,537
I just need a regular job that
is not life-threatening and pays my bills.

460
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:20,400
So thank you very much
and I left my uniform in the office...

461
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:23,010
-...and I will be seeing you.
-Larry!

462
00:42:28,857 --> 00:42:31,363
-Dad?
-Hey.

463
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,868
Hey, buddy.
What are you guys doing here?

464
00:42:33,973 --> 00:42:37,836
Oh, Erica had to be in court early,
so I'm taking Mr. Big Stuff here to school.

465
00:42:38,045 --> 00:42:40,341
But he wanted to swing by,
see you in the new job.

466
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:43,787
It's so awesome
that you're working here.

467
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:47,023
Hey, Niko, you wanna take
a little look-a-doo inside?

468
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,216
Maybe your dad will give you a VlP tour.

469
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,827
You know what?
We're pretty slammed this morning.

470
00:42:51,931 --> 00:42:56,525
Yeah, but Nicky, I promise,
I'll show you around soon, okay? Deal?

471
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,300
-Deal.
-All right.

472
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,493
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

473
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:02,372
-Love you.
-Love you too, buddy.

474
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,356
Bye, now. All right.

475
00:43:34,121 --> 00:43:35,687
Hey, Larry.

476
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:38,402
So I was thinking
maybe I'll give it one more night.

477
00:43:38,506 --> 00:43:40,490
I'm glad you came around.
Welcome back.

478
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:43,831
You. New night guard, here, now.

479
00:43:51,975 --> 00:43:54,167
-What's up?
-"What's up? "

480
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:57,926
Oh, well, take a walk with me
and I'll show you, Mr. "What's up? "

481
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,492
Come on.

482
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:05,653
So would you kindly do me the favor
of explaining this?

483
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:11,917
Okay. I'm guessing--

484
00:44:12,126 --> 00:44:16,824
And I'm just spitballing here,
but looks like that Roman dude got cocky...

485
00:44:17,033 --> 00:44:18,808
...and climbed over into the Wild West.

486
00:44:19,017 --> 00:44:22,149
And the cowboy knows Roman dude
wants to take over his territory...

487
00:44:22,253 --> 00:44:24,759
...so he rounded up a posse
and put him in the stockade.

488
00:44:26,651 --> 00:44:28,948
"Let's all laugh at me,
the comedy night guard."

489
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,872
"No" is the answer.

490
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:35,526
Sarcasm back at you,
with your humor box.

491
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:38,240
I wasn't laughing. Pretending to laugh...

492
00:44:38,449 --> 00:44:41,896
...if that's what you want,
some sort of battle of humor.

493
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,462
Do you?

494
00:44:45,028 --> 00:44:46,489
No.

495
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,830
I don't want--
No, I don't want a battle of humor.

496
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:52,858
No, you don't,
because it would be a bloodbath.

497
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:55,468
Nothing funny about Little Bighorn.

498
00:44:58,183 --> 00:45:02,464
No. I find it about as funny
as a "fancist."

499
00:45:03,194 --> 00:45:08,206
It's not funny. Okay? And I will not
stand for this type of blatant....

500
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:12,173
If I'm not clear, tell me.

501
00:45:14,575 --> 00:45:15,933
Am I clear?

502
00:45:16,873 --> 00:45:18,647
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

503
00:45:22,824 --> 00:45:24,077
Hey, Cecil?

504
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:28,148
You got an extra copy
of that instruction manual?

505
00:45:28,357 --> 00:45:32,429
Oh, no. I'm afraid not, Larry.
Listen, I'll tell you what you do.

506
00:45:32,638 --> 00:45:35,144
Read some books.
Brush up on your history.

507
00:45:35,352 --> 00:45:37,649
Helped me a lot when I first started out.

508
00:45:39,215 --> 00:45:43,078
This museum was originally dedicated
to that man on the horse up there...

509
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:44,749
...President Theodore Roosevelt.

510
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:49,029
He absolutely loved history and believed
that the more you know about the past...

511
00:45:49,238 --> 00:45:52,163
...the better prepared you are
for the future.

512
00:45:53,624 --> 00:45:57,174
Okay, kids. Who can tell me
what this room's called?

513
00:45:57,383 --> 00:45:59,784
Very good. The Hall of African Mammals.

514
00:45:59,993 --> 00:46:02,812
Right here we have the king of the jungle,
the lion.

515
00:46:03,438 --> 00:46:07,510
Up ahead is one of my favorite creatures
in the whole museum, the capuchin monkey.

516
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:12,626
A highly intelligent primate
known for its loving and generous nature.

517
00:46:16,594 --> 00:46:17,951
Excuse me?

518
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,083
I just thought that was....

519
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:24,006
I just was laughing in agreement.

520
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:27,975
Happy monkey.

521
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,525
All right, kids. This way.

522
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:38,937
Let me tell you something.
I'm not buying it.

523
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:42,592
You might have them fooled,
you might have the kids fooled. Not me.

524
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,246
Can't get past me.
There's a storm coming, buddy.

525
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:47,916
There's a storm coming.

526
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,076
One of the most famous trackers
in history, Sakagawea was the woman...

527
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:57,522
...who led Lewis and Clark on
their expedition to find the Pacific Ocean.

528
00:46:57,626 --> 00:47:00,967
You guys have heard the saying,
"Actions speak louder than words."

529
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:03,159
And yet they wrote--

530
00:47:03,264 --> 00:47:05,979
-Yes, Mr. Daley?
-Yes. Was she deaf?

531
00:47:07,337 --> 00:47:11,095
Was she deaf? No. She was not.
But she--

532
00:47:11,304 --> 00:47:16,629
Yeah, because-- Just-- She does seem
a little bit sort of unresponsive.

533
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:18,404
That's because she's a statue.

534
00:47:20,596 --> 00:47:24,355
Kids, could you give me one sec?
Go check her out. She's really cool.

535
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,844
-What are you doing?
-I'm gonna be here every night.

536
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:31,872
I wanted to learn a little bit more
about what I'm guarding.

537
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:34,065
Actually, I've got a bunch of questions.

538
00:47:34,169 --> 00:47:37,092
Maybe when you have a break,
could I buy you a cup of coffee?

539
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:38,658
A cup of coffee?

540
00:47:38,658 --> 00:47:40,956
Yeah, I mean, just purely a, you know...

541
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:45,550
...colleague-to-colleague,
information-download sort of coffee.

542
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:48,682
I finish in 20 minutes.
I'll meet you outside.

543
00:47:48,891 --> 00:47:50,353
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

544
00:47:50,562 --> 00:47:53,381
-And have a good rest of your--
-All right. Okay, kids.

545
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,691
It was incredible what she did.

546
00:47:55,795 --> 00:47:59,032
She literally led these men
across rivers, up mountains...

547
00:47:59,241 --> 00:48:02,790
...all with her newborn baby on her back.
She was the ultimate working mother.

548
00:48:02,895 --> 00:48:05,296
Wow, you are quite
the Sakagawean expert.

549
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,489
-Sakagawean.
-Sakagawean?

550
00:48:07,697 --> 00:48:11,978
Yeah. I should be, I've been writing
my dissertation on her for four years.

551
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:16,050
You've been working on one paper
for four years? That would drive me crazy.

552
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:20,331
Actually, it's more like a 900-page book.

553
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:24,925
So, what's your story? Have you
always wanted to be a security guard?

554
00:48:25,761 --> 00:48:28,997
-Oh, I didn't mean to--
-No, no, no.

555
00:48:29,102 --> 00:48:32,965
No, I'm divorced
and I have a 1 0-year-old son...

556
00:48:33,173 --> 00:48:36,932
...so I needed to find
a more steady situation.

557
00:48:37,141 --> 00:48:40,169
Got it. So, what can I tell you
about the museum?

558
00:48:40,377 --> 00:48:43,405
Okay, Attila the Hun.
What is that guy's problem?

559
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,642
Attila was considered the only
genuine threat to the Roman Empire.

560
00:48:47,164 --> 00:48:50,087
" Known as the 'Scourge of God'...

561
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:54,786
...Attila and his Huns would often
tear off the limbs of their helpless victims.

562
00:48:56,874 --> 00:48:59,171
Attila was famous
for his superstitious beliefs.

563
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,452
He surrounded himself with a phalanx
of sorcerers and magicians...

564
00:49:03,661 --> 00:49:06,897
...who advised and mystified him
with their dark arts."

565
00:49:59,623 --> 00:50:01,085
Larry?

566
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,069
Just wanted to say good luck, son.

567
00:50:03,382 --> 00:50:05,889
And goodbye.
We're clocking out for the last time.

568
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:07,663
If you're ever in Boca, look us up.

569
00:50:07,768 --> 00:50:11,004
Wait, you guys are going out of town?
What if this doesn't work out?

570
00:50:11,213 --> 00:50:13,719
Smart fellow like you? You'll be fine.

571
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:18,417
Yeah. We'll just be a phone call away.
Come on, walk us out.

572
00:50:18,626 --> 00:50:21,445
You fellas go ahead.

573
00:50:22,698 --> 00:50:24,368
I need a moment.

574
00:50:24,473 --> 00:50:29,171
He's very emotional.
A lot of memories in this room.

575
00:51:25,552 --> 00:51:27,640
Go crazy, big guy.

576
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,531
Hey, guys.

577
00:51:34,635 --> 00:51:36,619
Quest for fire...

578
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:40,378
...over. Knock yourselves out.

579
00:51:42,153 --> 00:51:43,510
Morning, dum-dum.

580
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:47,373
Me no dum-dum. You dum-dum.
You bring me gum-gum?

581
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:51,654
Yes, I did, fathead.
Lots and lots of gum-gum.

582
00:52:11,492 --> 00:52:16,607
What's that?
I can't hear you through the glass.

583
00:52:18,487 --> 00:52:20,053
Sorry.

584
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,454
Heave.

585
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:25,795
Heave. Heave.

586
00:52:26,004 --> 00:52:28,510
Hey, what's going on over here?

587
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:31,016
We expand or we die.

588
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:33,522
Heave.

589
00:52:33,731 --> 00:52:35,193
-Heave.
-On the count of three...

590
00:52:35,401 --> 00:52:38,847
...you blow this anthill to kingdom come.

591
00:52:39,473 --> 00:52:42,814
-And a one and a two--
-Hey, Jed. Stop that.

592
00:52:43,023 --> 00:52:46,886
No, no. You blow a hole in your mountain,
all you're gonna hit is a wall.

593
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:51,376
Step aside, Gigantor. We got us a railroad
to build. We're blowing a hole in that thing.

594
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,821
Okay, first of all, enough with
the Gigantor giant stuff, okay?

595
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,788
-I'm just trying to close up shop.
-We're gonna blow it anyway. And a three!

596
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,904
Yeah. What are you doing?

597
00:53:04,217 --> 00:53:07,351
What's it look like we're doing?
It's manifest destiny.

598
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:11,318
You can't fight it and neither can l.
Go! More dynamite.

599
00:53:11,527 --> 00:53:13,928
-Yeah, use it all.
-All right. Okay.

600
00:53:14,137 --> 00:53:16,852
Listen, "Octavus"? You gotta stop that.

601
00:53:16,956 --> 00:53:18,940
It's Octavius, mary.

602
00:53:19,044 --> 00:53:22,803
Okay, you know what? Fine. Great.
Here you go. This is what happens.

603
00:53:22,907 --> 00:53:25,204
-You cannot do this. I am a Roman general.
-Sorry.

604
00:53:25,308 --> 00:53:26,561
-I have rights.
-And you.

605
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,276
-Hey, no! Put me down!
-Keep heaving, men.

606
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:30,737
You can't stop progress!

607
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:33,139
We're gonna have a little talk, okay?

608
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:36,271
I told you, I don't like to be manhandled.

609
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,030
No, I will manhandle you, Jedediah.
Now, listen, guys.

610
00:53:40,238 --> 00:53:42,850
What is your problem, huh?
Why can't you just get along?

611
00:53:43,058 --> 00:53:45,355
Look, we're men. We fight, okay?
That's what we do.

612
00:53:45,564 --> 00:53:47,130
It's kind of how we pass the time.

613
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:51,724
You're, like, a giant. A freak, if you will.
We can't expect you to understand that.

614
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:55,587
You got the whole room to run around in.
You don't have to be near each other.

615
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:59,868
-What, you mean...?
-You're gonna let us out?

616
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,791
What, and just roam free?

617
00:54:03,222 --> 00:54:05,728
Yeah. Yeah, I might,
if you promise to behave.

618
00:54:05,936 --> 00:54:09,069
That means no fireballs,
no explosions, okay?

619
00:54:09,277 --> 00:54:10,426
You have my word, my liege.

620
00:54:10,635 --> 00:54:13,349
Yeah, no problemo, Gigantor.

621
00:54:13,454 --> 00:54:17,421
My name's Larry, first of all. Okay, Jed?

622
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:20,345
So I call you Jed.
I don't call you Tiny, right?

623
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,016
What's that supposed to mean?

624
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:27,863
-"Hey, Teeny." How does that sound?
-I don't like it. It hurts my feelings.

625
00:54:27,967 --> 00:54:30,682
"Gigantor" makes me feel
like some sort of freak, so....

626
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,396
I don't. I just call you Larry.

627
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,484
Don't be a kiss-ass, okay?

628
00:54:35,693 --> 00:54:37,572
Look, I'm trusting you guys, all right?

629
00:54:37,677 --> 00:54:41,122
If you don't do what I say,
you can end up like the Mayan world there.

630
00:54:41,331 --> 00:54:43,419
Locked up. Take a look.

631
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:46,760
-Do they look happy?
-No.

632
00:54:48,013 --> 00:54:49,370
They look sad.

633
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:52,607
They can't do what they wanna do.
Now, I'm letting you guys...

634
00:54:52,816 --> 00:54:56,053
...have a little bit of leash here.
Don't choke me with it, okay?

635
00:54:56,262 --> 00:55:00,438
I gotta run. You guys play nice, okay?
Okay. Good. Thanks.

636
00:55:02,109 --> 00:55:04,406
Hey, how's that gum treating you,
dum-dum?

637
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,867
Good.

638
00:55:09,313 --> 00:55:12,132
Oh, hey, Dexter.
I'm just locking up. You want in?

639
00:55:13,802 --> 00:55:15,368
Yeah?

640
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:18,605
All right.

641
00:55:24,556 --> 00:55:26,435
What's that? You got my keys?

642
00:55:29,045 --> 00:55:30,507
I don't think so.

643
00:55:32,387 --> 00:55:36,877
Looks like Uncle Larry pulled a fast one
on little Dexie.

644
00:55:37,086 --> 00:55:39,069
Those are baby keys for a little baby.

645
00:55:39,278 --> 00:55:41,471
Have fun with your baby keys,
little baby monkey.

646
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:45,125
Tomorrow I'll bring you a little baby diapy
so you can go poo-poo in it.

647
00:55:45,229 --> 00:55:47,630
I'll give you a tickle
because you're a cute baby.

648
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:52,538
While you cry all night long
about how Uncle Larry fooled you, huh?

649
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,043
I told you there was a storm coming.

650
00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:04,653
-Hey, Teddy.
-Lawrence.

651
00:56:04,757 --> 00:56:07,368
You impertinent pup.
I knew you'd come back.

652
00:56:07,682 --> 00:56:11,336
-You look like a man on a mission.
-Yeah, I'm gonna give it another shot.

653
00:56:19,271 --> 00:56:21,881
-You...?
-What?

654
00:56:21,985 --> 00:56:25,326
-You checking her out?
-The nerve.

655
00:56:25,535 --> 00:56:28,459
Checking her out.
I've never heard of such a thing.

656
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:32,635
No, no, no. I'm just-- I mean
because, you know, she's very beautiful.

657
00:56:32,739 --> 00:56:34,514
-Beautiful?
-Yeah.

658
00:56:38,586 --> 00:56:41,196
-Rather handsome woman, I suppose.
-Yeah.

659
00:56:41,614 --> 00:56:44,225
I don't know,
maybe you should go talk to her.

660
00:56:44,329 --> 00:56:46,939
-lndeed. Bless you, lad.
-Yeah. All right.

661
00:56:47,148 --> 00:56:49,967
-Carry on.
-Good. See you.

662
00:57:07,194 --> 00:57:08,969
I....

663
00:57:56,484 --> 00:57:58,155
Hey, hi.

664
00:57:58,886 --> 00:58:02,435
No! It's okay!
It's okay. You guys speak English?

665
00:58:02,853 --> 00:58:04,001
No?

666
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,491
Right. I don't know what that means...

667
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,772
...and I know that you and I got off
on the wrong foot last night, but...

668
00:58:14,755 --> 00:58:19,349
...a little birdie told me
that somebody likes...

669
00:58:20,184 --> 00:58:21,437
...magic.

670
00:58:21,646 --> 00:58:24,569
-Magic?
-Magic.

671
00:58:25,405 --> 00:58:27,075
Sorcery.

672
00:58:27,388 --> 00:58:28,850
Ah, sorcer--

673
00:58:28,954 --> 00:58:31,460
Yes. Illusion.

674
00:58:31,773 --> 00:58:33,236
Everybody likes magic.

675
00:58:33,445 --> 00:58:37,412
And flowers. People like flowers.

676
00:58:37,621 --> 00:58:39,083
There you go. Those are for you.

677
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:41,797
You know what else people like?
Money.

678
00:58:42,006 --> 00:58:46,391
The almighty dollar, right?
But money can sometimes...

679
00:58:47,331 --> 00:58:48,584
...disappear.

680
00:58:51,507 --> 00:58:53,491
At least that's what l...

681
00:58:54,222 --> 00:58:55,370
...hear.

682
00:58:57,041 --> 00:59:00,799
No wonder you can't understand me.
You got a coin in your ear.

683
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,855
Check this out. Anybody need a hanky?

684
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:11,554
Well, I wouldn't suggest this little
feller because he has a nasty habit...

685
00:59:12,076 --> 00:59:14,373
...of vanishing...

686
00:59:16,461 --> 00:59:18,445
...into thin air!

687
00:59:19,384 --> 00:59:21,681
No, no. Don't. That defeats the-- Don't!

688
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:43,920
Not the limbs. Guys, please,
do not tear the limbs.

689
01:00:00,321 --> 01:00:02,096
Cortes, right?

690
01:00:18,275 --> 01:00:19,527
How?

691
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:24,853
You! Don't even think about it.
Don't you--

692
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,150
Dexter!

693
01:00:37,591 --> 01:00:39,157
Come on, guys!

694
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:06,199
Hey, guys!

695
01:01:10,075 --> 01:01:12,581
Hey, guys. Hey, guys!

696
01:01:14,669 --> 01:01:16,653
Sorry. What's going on?
What happened here?

697
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:18,114
I thought we had a deal.

698
01:01:18,323 --> 01:01:20,516
We will never coexist
with these buffoons.

699
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:22,604
We're past words, Laredo.

700
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:25,840
Now it's time to let Smith & Wesson
do the talking!

701
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:27,406
Those guns don't even work.

702
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:29,808
They don't? Take a look at this.

703
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,194
Dexter!

704
01:02:23,683 --> 01:02:24,936
Why?

705
01:02:31,827 --> 01:02:33,915
Ho! Dexter.

706
01:02:41,432 --> 01:02:43,520
End of the line, cool breeze.

707
01:02:45,086 --> 01:02:46,549
End of the line.

708
01:03:04,924 --> 01:03:06,699
I am not playing games here.

709
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:12,546
Just hand them over.

710
01:03:17,766 --> 01:03:20,063
Easy. That's it, Dexter.

711
01:03:20,272 --> 01:03:22,361
Nice and easy, Dex. That's it.

712
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:47,209
Good Lord, Lawrence!
Why are you slapping a monkey?

713
01:03:47,836 --> 01:03:51,072
Teddy, this guy's been pushing me,
and I'm sick of it!

714
01:03:51,281 --> 01:03:54,309
Poppycock. This little creature is
your primate brother.

715
01:03:54,518 --> 01:03:56,293
Without him, there's no us.

716
01:03:56,919 --> 01:03:58,172
Are you rabid?

717
01:03:58,382 --> 01:04:00,052
Wipe that off.

718
01:04:00,783 --> 01:04:03,393
You have to deal with this creature
with love and respect.

719
01:04:03,602 --> 01:04:05,377
May I have the keys, dear friend?

720
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:09,240
Thank you. Lawrence?

721
01:04:11,328 --> 01:04:12,581
Well, you know what?

722
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:15,818
You seem to know what you're doing,
so I'm gonna let you take over.

723
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:19,054
No, no. My dear boy, you can't put up
the white flag now.

724
01:04:19,263 --> 01:04:21,247
The museum is on the verge
of total anarchy.

725
01:04:21,456 --> 01:04:23,126
I tried! I came back tonight,
didn't l?

726
01:04:23,335 --> 01:04:26,676
Tried? That was one night. I didn't build
the Panama Canal in one day.

727
01:04:26,885 --> 01:04:30,121
That's great, but I'm dealing with
the most ridiculous job in history.

728
01:04:30,226 --> 01:04:31,792
Some men are born great, Lawrence--

729
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,402
Yeah, I know. Others have
greatness thrust upon them.

730
01:04:34,716 --> 01:04:36,491
You hit me with that chestnut
last night.

731
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,206
The thing is, not everyone is great.

732
01:04:39,414 --> 01:04:42,024
That's the problem.
Some of us are just ordinary.

733
01:04:42,233 --> 01:04:44,843
No, you're not, Lawrence.
Stop wallowing in self-pity.

734
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:46,723
Every journey begins with a footstep.

735
01:04:46,932 --> 01:04:50,168
Teach the inhabitants to get along,
they wouldn't need to be locked up.

736
01:04:50,377 --> 01:04:53,405
That means a lot coming from a guy
who's spent the last 50 years...

737
01:04:53,613 --> 01:04:55,806
...spying on a girl he's never even
talked to.

738
01:04:56,641 --> 01:04:59,669
I was going to make contact.
Lawrence, please.

739
01:05:00,204 --> 01:05:01,979
I'm done, all right?

740
01:05:06,364 --> 01:05:09,601
No, Rexy! No!

741
01:05:41,341 --> 01:05:43,429
Oh, no.

742
01:06:46,805 --> 01:06:48,580
All right.

743
01:06:57,768 --> 01:07:01,528
No one comes here anymore. Besides,
I took this tour in second grade, Daley.

744
01:07:01,736 --> 01:07:04,138
I'm telling you,
my dad's gonna hook us up.

745
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:06,748
-Mr. Daley?
-Yeah?

746
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:10,089
-Foam.
-Yes, I know.

747
01:07:10,298 --> 01:07:11,551
In the Neanderthal display.

748
01:07:11,759 --> 01:07:14,683
There was an incident last night
with the fire extinguisher.

749
01:07:14,892 --> 01:07:16,562
I was on my way to go clean it up.

750
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:19,172
Okay, don't bother. You're fired.

751
01:07:20,947 --> 01:07:23,140
I don't think we're getting a tour today.

752
01:07:23,348 --> 01:07:25,332
Your dad just got canned, dude.

753
01:07:26,898 --> 01:07:28,882
Excuse me?

754
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,866
Mr. McPhee?

755
01:07:31,805 --> 01:07:33,163
Excuse me, Mr. McPhee?

756
01:07:33,371 --> 01:07:35,669
Can I talk to you about this, please?

757
01:07:35,878 --> 01:07:37,027
-Sir?
-What?

758
01:07:37,131 --> 01:07:40,054
I know I screwed up, but I finally
understand how to do this job.

759
01:07:40,263 --> 01:07:43,395
-You obviously don't.
-No, I didn't, but now I do.

760
01:07:43,604 --> 01:07:46,319
-Really, Mr. McPhee--
-Doctor.

761
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,629
Dr. McPhee.

762
01:07:49,568 --> 01:07:51,448
Can you please give me one more night?

763
01:07:54,267 --> 01:07:56,459
-One more night.
-Okay, thank you.

764
01:07:56,564 --> 01:07:59,905
And if anything is the tiniest...

765
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:02,828
...after your shift:

766
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:06,169
Because....

767
01:08:09,197 --> 01:08:10,867
-Got it.
-Okay?

768
01:08:11,076 --> 01:08:14,836
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice....

769
01:08:19,743 --> 01:08:22,979
Shame on me. Fool me--
Shame on me.

770
01:08:23,084 --> 01:08:25,589
-You.
-Fool me twice.... Got it.

771
01:08:25,798 --> 01:08:28,513
-Take it or leave it.
-Okay. Thank you.

772
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,568
-Hey.
-Hey.

773
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,909
-What's wrong?
-Maybe you should ask Nicky.

774
01:08:40,415 --> 01:08:43,130
Hey, buddy. What's going on?

775
01:08:43,756 --> 01:08:45,322
You got fired.

776
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,933
What are you talking about?
I didn't get fired.

777
01:08:49,395 --> 01:08:53,153
I came to the museum this morning.
I saw your boss yelling at you.

778
01:08:54,093 --> 01:08:56,808
Why didn't you tell me?
Everything's fine.

779
01:08:57,016 --> 01:08:59,105
We just had a little misunderstanding.

780
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:00,671
Why?

781
01:09:02,028 --> 01:09:05,056
It's hard to explain.
I mean, you wouldn't bel--

782
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:09,336
You know what? Let me show you.

783
01:09:09,754 --> 01:09:11,946
-Show me what?
-Come to work with me tonight.

784
01:09:12,155 --> 01:09:13,513
Larry?

785
01:09:13,617 --> 01:09:16,332
Can I talk to you for a second?

786
01:09:19,464 --> 01:09:20,821
Am I in trouble?

787
01:09:20,925 --> 01:09:22,700
Larry, what are you doing?

788
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,311
I just wanna show him what I do.
That's all.

789
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:28,444
I love that you wanna share that
with him, but I gotta tell you...

790
01:09:28,652 --> 01:09:32,202
...I don't think Nicky has any room
in his heart for more disappointment.

791
01:09:33,559 --> 01:09:35,126
He won't be disappointed.

792
01:09:35,961 --> 01:09:37,214
Larry.

793
01:09:37,736 --> 01:09:39,719
He won't be disappointed.

794
01:09:45,579 --> 01:09:48,629
Listen, hang out in the security
office till everyone's gone.

795
01:09:48,907 --> 01:09:51,018
Then I'm gonna come get you.
All right?

796
01:10:10,781 --> 01:10:14,017
Hey, miss? I'm gonna have to ask you
to vacate the premises.

797
01:10:14,017 --> 01:10:15,375
-Hey there.
-Hey.

798
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:20,282
-Good place to think, huh?
-Yeah. Definitely.

799
01:10:21,326 --> 01:10:23,832
So no big plans tonight?

800
01:10:23,936 --> 01:10:26,859
Yeah, no, I'm not really
a big-plan person.

801
01:10:27,173 --> 01:10:29,887
I prefer hanging out with people
who are dead for 200 years.

802
01:10:30,096 --> 01:10:31,766
It's the live ones that throw me.

803
01:10:31,871 --> 01:10:35,734
That's cool. Seriously though,
you do have to leave.

804
01:10:35,838 --> 01:10:37,926
-Seriously?
-Yeah, sorry. It's museum rules.

805
01:10:38,031 --> 01:10:40,745
We're sort of locking everything up.

806
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:44,086
You're really taking your job seriously.

807
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:47,741
You know, once I clip on the tie,
I'm all business.

808
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:49,099
-I get it.
-Yeah.

809
01:10:49,308 --> 01:10:51,187
How's that dissertation coming?

810
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:55,781
I've hit a dead end. I mean,
research can only get me so far.

811
01:10:55,989 --> 01:10:57,869
I'm never gonna know
who she really was.

812
01:10:58,495 --> 01:11:02,671
So I think it's time that I move on
to another subject.

813
01:11:03,193 --> 01:11:04,968
I'll let you get back to work.

814
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:10,189
-Good night, Larry.
-Yeah, okay.

815
01:11:10,502 --> 01:11:12,277
Night.

816
01:11:19,481 --> 01:11:20,838
Hey.

817
01:11:22,301 --> 01:11:23,971
Rebecca!

818
01:11:26,477 --> 01:11:28,774
-Hey, Rebecca.
-Hey.

819
01:11:28,983 --> 01:11:32,219
Hey. Listen, I don't think you should
give up on your paper.

820
01:11:32,324 --> 01:11:34,203
Okay. Why?

821
01:11:34,412 --> 01:11:37,231
All right, look, this is gonna
sound crazy, all right?

822
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,945
I mean, it's gonna sound, like,
really, really crazy.

823
01:11:40,154 --> 01:11:42,869
-Okay.
-No, I mean insanely crazy.

824
01:11:42,973 --> 01:11:44,539
-I can handle it.
-Okay.

825
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:49,342
You know how they say in certain
museums, history comes alive?

826
01:11:49,446 --> 01:11:52,370
-Yeah.
-ln this museum...

827
01:11:53,205 --> 01:11:54,771
...it actually does.

828
01:11:56,546 --> 01:11:58,217
What are you talking about?

829
01:12:02,811 --> 01:12:07,196
Everything in this museum
comes to life at night.

830
01:12:10,642 --> 01:12:13,774
-Really?
-Yeah, really. I'm not kidding you.

831
01:12:13,982 --> 01:12:16,071
You know that tablet?
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah?

832
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:19,203
It actually brings things to life.
It's like some ancient spell.

833
01:12:19,412 --> 01:12:22,126
Since the '50s, every night
everything's been coming to life.

834
01:12:22,335 --> 01:12:27,451
Teddy Roosevelt told me. Seriously.
The monkey, Dexter? The cute little--

835
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,121
-What is he?
-Capuchin.

836
01:12:29,226 --> 01:12:32,567
A capuchin. Right. The capuchin.
He urinated on me and bit my nose.

837
01:12:33,506 --> 01:12:37,370
And Sakagawea is in her case,
alive every night...

838
01:12:37,579 --> 01:12:39,772
...just listening to Lewis and Clark
argue.

839
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:42,382
So if you really wanna get inside
her head...

840
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,618
...I can hook that up.

841
01:12:47,184 --> 01:12:48,437
That's cool.

842
01:12:48,646 --> 01:12:51,778
Yeah, it's cool. It's freaking awesome.

843
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:57,103
Make fun of the history geek.

844
01:12:57,833 --> 01:13:00,966
-No. Rebecca!
-Good night, Larry.

845
01:13:02,854 --> 01:13:05,673
No, I'm not making fun of you.
Rebecca.

846
01:13:16,537 --> 01:13:19,042
-Here you go. Best seat in the house.
-What's going on?

847
01:13:19,251 --> 01:13:21,757
If I told you, you'd think I'm crazy.
I'm gonna show you.

848
01:13:21,966 --> 01:13:25,516
-What?
-You'll see in about 20 seconds.

849
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,799
-Okay, you like Tyrannosaurus Rex?
-Yeah.

850
01:13:28,008 --> 01:13:30,217
Yeah? Well, I call him Rexy.

851
01:13:30,218 --> 01:13:34,708
And he's about to come to life,
Nicholas, in...

852
01:13:37,109 --> 01:13:42,120
...five, four, three, two....

853
01:13:49,221 --> 01:13:51,727
-Dad?
-Hang on a sec.

854
01:13:51,936 --> 01:13:55,277
Say hello to Rexy!

855
01:13:56,425 --> 01:13:57,574
Dad, are you okay?

856
01:13:59,975 --> 01:14:01,437
This is weird.

857
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:03,629
Guys! Come on!

858
01:14:04,255 --> 01:14:06,030
Sundown!

859
01:14:08,327 --> 01:14:11,773
Hey, T.R., come on, rise and shine.
Buddy, I need you to wake up.

860
01:14:11,877 --> 01:14:13,965
Come on, my kid is here.
I need you to wake up.

861
01:14:14,174 --> 01:14:17,306
Texas? Texas! Come on!
Texas! Come on! Get on, Texas!

862
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,394
Get on, Texas! Get up.

863
01:14:19,603 --> 01:14:21,691
Just stop, okay?

864
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:25,346
No, Nicky, I'm telling you,
there's this tablet, okay?

865
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:27,539
Called the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.
Every night--

866
01:14:27,643 --> 01:14:30,358
-Now there's a tablet?
-Yeah, there is.

867
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:31,933
Come on, Dad.

868
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,265
Come on.

869
01:14:39,854 --> 01:14:41,838
-It's gone.
-What's gone?

870
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:45,492
The tablet. I think somebody stole it.

871
01:14:45,806 --> 01:14:47,476
Yeah, right.

872
01:14:47,685 --> 01:14:49,460
I'm not kidding, Nicky.

873
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,471
Nicky?

874
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:58,439
Hey, Nicky!

875
01:14:59,901 --> 01:15:02,616
Hey! Hey, Nicky! Where are you going?

876
01:15:02,825 --> 01:15:05,748
-Home.
-What? Wait a minute.

877
01:15:10,133 --> 01:15:11,595
Come on.

878
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,975
You guys shouldn't be here.

879
01:15:23,184 --> 01:15:24,437
Give us the tablet, son.

880
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:26,629
Wait a minute, Nicky.
What are you guys doing?

881
01:15:26,734 --> 01:15:29,030
We're not gonna hurt you.
Give us the tablet.

882
01:15:29,135 --> 01:15:32,163
I'm sorry to tell you this, son,
but your dad doesn't work here.

883
01:15:32,163 --> 01:15:35,296
He got fired this morning.
Couldn't hack it.

884
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,428
Dad? I thought you said
you weren't fired.

885
01:15:38,532 --> 01:15:40,934
I did. They're lying,
trying to steal that thing.

886
01:15:41,143 --> 01:15:43,627
Turn the middle piece,
you'll see what I was talking about.

887
01:15:43,761 --> 01:15:45,641
That is museum property, son.
Give it back.

888
01:15:45,745 --> 01:15:47,729
Nicky, trust me. Just turn it.

889
01:15:48,147 --> 01:15:50,235
-Give us the tablet!
-Nicky?

890
01:15:50,965 --> 01:15:52,427
Trust me.

891
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:16,037
Nick? Run. Now.

892
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:19,165
Get back here, kid!

893
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:23,545
Bad idea, Larry.

894
01:16:24,063 --> 01:16:26,673
You wanna dance, hot dog?
You wanna dance?

895
01:16:26,778 --> 01:16:28,970
Gus, you're an old man.
I don't wanna hurt you.

896
01:16:31,267 --> 01:16:35,026
You see, Larry, a few years into
the job, the three of us realized that...

897
01:16:35,234 --> 01:16:39,306
...like everything else in this museum,
we got new life at night.

898
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,556
Sundown to sunrise,
we felt young again.

899
01:16:44,744 --> 01:16:46,310
Okay. Did not see that coming.

900
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,191
Gave us an energy boost.

901
01:16:48,295 --> 01:16:50,592
We love the nightlife, Larry.

902
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:53,089
So when we found out
they were gonna fired us...

903
01:16:53,298 --> 01:16:54,759
...we had to steal the tablet.

904
01:16:54,968 --> 01:16:56,952
Everyone knows you need the money.

905
01:16:57,161 --> 01:16:59,040
Add the stuff we planted
in your place...

906
01:16:59,144 --> 01:17:01,337
...pretty obvious you committed
the crime.

907
01:17:01,546 --> 01:17:03,425
Take care of that cut.

908
01:17:03,634 --> 01:17:05,618
Come on, guys, let's go find that kid.

909
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:09,585
-Sweet dreams, cupcake!
-No!

910
01:17:09,689 --> 01:17:11,151
Pile driver!

911
01:17:11,802 --> 01:17:13,766
Let's get our tablet.

912
01:17:39,259 --> 01:17:41,556
Thank you very much.
We'll take it from here.

913
01:17:41,765 --> 01:17:43,331
Nicky!

914
01:17:45,315 --> 01:17:48,134
Just in time, Larry.
We were just locking up.

915
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:51,579
Sleep tight, hotshot.

916
01:17:53,563 --> 01:17:55,442
Let's grab everything we can fence.

917
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:59,932
I don't know about you,
but I'm planning on a long retirement.

918
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:11,613
Teddy! Teddy, if you're out there,
I need you, pal!

919
01:18:14,118 --> 01:18:15,267
Someone call my name?

920
01:18:17,146 --> 01:18:19,548
Theodore Roosevelt, at your service.

921
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,740
Teddy, can you get us out of here?

922
01:18:21,844 --> 01:18:24,141
Can't do it, man. This is your moment.

923
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:26,856
Will you save the lectures, please?
I'm not you. Okay?

924
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,510
I didn't build the Panama Canal,
I wasn't president of the United States!

925
01:18:30,615 --> 01:18:31,867
I need some help. Come on.

926
01:18:31,972 --> 01:18:33,747
Actually...

927
01:18:35,835 --> 01:18:39,803
...I never did any of those things.
Teddy Roosevelt did.

928
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:42,831
I was made in a mannequin factory
in Poughkeepsie.

929
01:18:43,144 --> 01:18:45,024
I never shot a wild beast.

930
01:18:45,128 --> 01:18:48,364
I'm not even brave enough to tell
that beautiful woman I love her.

931
01:18:48,587 --> 01:18:49,944
But you...

932
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:54,224
...you gotta finish the job this time.
You can't quit.

933
01:18:56,939 --> 01:18:58,923
I'm made of wax, Larry.

934
01:18:59,445 --> 01:19:01,220
What are you made of?

935
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:09,128
-Wait! That's all you got for me?
-That's it!

936
01:19:21,053 --> 01:19:23,037
That's it. Come on.

937
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:25,325
Duck!

938
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:28,362
Go over there!

939
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:51,954
Hey. Hi. How you doing?
Sorry to bother you...

940
01:19:52,058 --> 01:19:54,355
...but your guys there? Your jackal guys?

941
01:19:54,564 --> 01:19:56,861
Do you think you could ask them
to back off, please?

942
01:19:57,070 --> 01:20:00,306
We're not trying to hurt you, they think
we are. Could you do it like now?

943
01:20:06,153 --> 01:20:08,763
Thank you. Nicky.

944
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:10,643
Thank you.

945
01:20:18,682 --> 01:20:19,913
Dad?

946
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:33,926
You would not believe how stuffy
it is in there.

947
01:20:36,014 --> 01:20:39,042
-How come you speak English?
-I went to Cambridge University.

948
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,295
You went to Cambridge?

949
01:20:40,504 --> 01:20:43,114
I was on display
in the Egyptology Department.

950
01:20:44,262 --> 01:20:46,768
I am Ahkmenrah, fourth king
of the fourth king...

951
01:20:46,977 --> 01:20:49,482
...ruler of the land of my fathers.

952
01:20:50,213 --> 01:20:52,406
I am Larry...

953
01:20:53,763 --> 01:20:55,642
...son of Milton...

954
01:20:55,747 --> 01:20:59,192
...and this is my son, Nick.

955
01:20:59,297 --> 01:21:01,803
And we hail from Brooklyn.

956
01:21:02,117 --> 01:21:05,458
Well, I do. I mean, he comes out and
stays with me on Wednesdays...

957
01:21:05,562 --> 01:21:06,815
...and every other weekend.

958
01:21:07,546 --> 01:21:11,826
That was the custody agreement
that we had.

959
01:21:12,348 --> 01:21:16,002
Larry, Nick, guardians of Brooklyn...

960
01:21:16,316 --> 01:21:18,195
...I am forever in your debt.

961
01:21:18,195 --> 01:21:20,805
Now bestow the tablet upon me...

962
01:21:21,014 --> 01:21:23,520
...so that I may assume command
of my kingdom.

963
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:27,487
Oh, yes. Okay, the tablet. I would...

964
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:31,037
...love to bestow it upon you,
but we don't actually...

965
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:32,516
...have it.

966
01:21:40,761 --> 01:21:43,475
Thanks, guys. Don't worry.
I'll watch out for him!

967
01:21:43,684 --> 01:21:45,041
Thank you.

968
01:22:00,076 --> 01:22:01,746
What is that?

969
01:22:02,999 --> 01:22:04,670
Huns.

970
01:22:05,818 --> 01:22:07,593
I gotta deal with this guy.

971
01:22:44,245 --> 01:22:46,437
Pardon me, Larry. I speak Hun.

972
01:22:54,373 --> 01:22:56,253
He says that he wants to rip you apart.

973
01:22:56,461 --> 01:22:59,071
All right. Again with the ripping.
Listen, I understand.

974
01:22:59,176 --> 01:23:02,726
I get it. Ripping for you....
You want to rip things, okay?

975
01:23:02,934 --> 01:23:06,902
And I think maybe that's because
somebody ripped you a long time ago.

976
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,781
In here.

977
01:23:09,512 --> 01:23:11,705
Somebody ripped little...

978
01:23:11,809 --> 01:23:14,732
...baby Attila a long time ago,
right here.

979
01:23:15,881 --> 01:23:19,326
They ripped something out,
didn't they?

980
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:22,876
They ripped the love.

981
01:23:23,711 --> 01:23:26,009
They ripped the love right out of you,
didn't they?

982
01:23:26,844 --> 01:23:30,499
A little baby all alone in a tent...

983
01:23:31,229 --> 01:23:33,526
...whose daddy went off...

984
01:23:34,257 --> 01:23:37,285
...to pillage some town...

985
01:23:37,389 --> 01:23:40,104
...or go and plunder somewhere,
just doing his job.

986
01:23:40,313 --> 01:23:42,401
But who was left alone?

987
01:23:45,846 --> 01:23:47,726
You.

988
01:23:52,946 --> 01:23:56,704
Let it out. Let it go.

989
01:24:17,282 --> 01:24:20,832
It's okay. It's okay.

990
01:24:22,398 --> 01:24:24,591
You're next.

991
01:24:28,454 --> 01:24:31,377
Good. That's good. Just breathe.

992
01:24:35,344 --> 01:24:36,702
-Larry Daley.
-Yeah.

993
01:24:40,461 --> 01:24:42,340
Good. Yes.

994
01:24:42,758 --> 01:24:44,637
Yeah. Okay. Good, good.

995
01:24:46,617 --> 01:24:49,436
All right!
I need everybody to listen up!

996
01:24:53,194 --> 01:24:54,656
Guys! Come on!

997
01:24:58,415 --> 01:25:04,783
Quiet!

998
01:25:14,498 --> 01:25:16,065
My dum-dum want to speak.

999
01:25:16,273 --> 01:25:18,048
Thank you.

1000
01:25:18,883 --> 01:25:21,180
Now, this here's King Ahkmenrah.

1001
01:25:21,389 --> 01:25:24,208
His tablet is what brings you to life
every night.

1002
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:27,236
And those old night watchmen?
They stole it.

1003
01:25:27,758 --> 01:25:30,368
Now, we need to find those guards
and get the tablet back...

1004
01:25:30,472 --> 01:25:32,352
...and we need to do it before morning.

1005
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:35,693
Civil War guys,
head over to the Planetarium Wing.

1006
01:25:37,885 --> 01:25:40,704
My explorer friend
whose name escapes me.

1007
01:25:40,913 --> 01:25:44,254
-It's Columbus.
-Right, Columbus! Right, I'm sorry.

1008
01:25:44,463 --> 01:25:47,177
There's no nameplate, so....
Columbus, take the Neanderthals...

1009
01:25:47,386 --> 01:25:50,310
...and do a sweep from lnvertebrates
all the way through Reptiles.

1010
01:25:50,519 --> 01:25:53,547
Jed and Octavius, their van's parked
out back. Go take care of it.

1011
01:25:53,652 --> 01:25:56,784
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!
No, sir. I ain't working with toga boy.

1012
01:25:56,993 --> 01:25:58,663
Romans work alone.

1013
01:25:59,394 --> 01:26:01,482
-That didn't hurt. Don't be a baby.
-Yes, it did.

1014
01:26:01,691 --> 01:26:02,944
Come on.

1015
01:26:03,466 --> 01:26:05,136
That was much harder!

1016
01:26:05,345 --> 01:26:06,807
Guys, come on!

1017
01:26:07,642 --> 01:26:09,730
Jed, Octavius.

1018
01:26:09,939 --> 01:26:12,236
Take away the fact you were born
2000 years apart...

1019
01:26:12,445 --> 01:26:13,906
...you guys aren't that different.

1020
01:26:14,533 --> 01:26:16,725
You're both great leaders.

1021
01:26:16,725 --> 01:26:19,022
You just want what's best
for your people, right?

1022
01:26:19,231 --> 01:26:20,693
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1023
01:26:20,901 --> 01:26:22,363
Civil War dudes.

1024
01:26:24,138 --> 01:26:28,942
You guys are brothers, for God's sakes.
You gotta stop fighting.

1025
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:33,640
North wins. Slavery's bad. Sorry.

1026
01:26:33,849 --> 01:26:39,278
Don't wanna burst your bubble.
But, South, you guys get Allman Brothers...

1027
01:26:40,009 --> 01:26:43,036
...and NASCAR, so just chill!

1028
01:26:44,394 --> 01:26:48,674
Look, without that tablet,
all of this...

1029
01:26:48,883 --> 01:26:52,537
...this whole coming-to-life-at-night thing,
it all goes away.

1030
01:26:52,746 --> 01:26:55,878
Now, I don't wanna let that happen,
but I need your help.

1031
01:26:56,087 --> 01:26:58,384
We can get this done,
but we gotta do it together.

1032
01:26:59,637 --> 01:27:00,890
So who's with me?

1033
01:27:02,143 --> 01:27:03,814
Yeah.

1034
01:27:04,023 --> 01:27:05,902
-Who's with me?
-Yeah!

1035
01:27:06,111 --> 01:27:08,617
-Yeah!
-Charge!

1036
01:27:09,578 --> 01:27:12,502
All right! Now, let's do this, people!

1037
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:16,147
And animals!

1038
01:27:18,027 --> 01:27:21,681
And weird, faceless puppet creatures.
Come on, let's go! Let's do it!

1039
01:27:44,751 --> 01:27:46,735
Come on! Follow me, boys!

1040
01:27:46,839 --> 01:27:48,510
Geronimo!

1041
01:28:00,307 --> 01:28:02,187
Oh, jeez.

1042
01:28:16,178 --> 01:28:20,354
Now, boys, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

1043
01:28:25,888 --> 01:28:28,185
I guess it's gonna be the hard way.

1044
01:28:32,048 --> 01:28:35,806
Right, men, we're almost there.

1045
01:28:55,962 --> 01:28:58,155
Save yourself!

1046
01:28:58,363 --> 01:29:00,347
I ain't quitting you!

1047
01:29:02,226 --> 01:29:03,792
Gus?

1048
01:29:06,089 --> 01:29:07,342
Reginald?

1049
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,535
Fellas, where are you?

1050
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:12,458
Guys?

1051
01:29:23,003 --> 01:29:26,553
That's what I'm talking about.
Good job, gentlemen.

1052
01:29:26,657 --> 01:29:28,224
Loving the teamwork!

1053
01:29:48,575 --> 01:29:52,020
They've vanished.
How will we find them?

1054
01:29:52,634 --> 01:29:54,952
I know someone who can help. Come on.

1055
01:29:55,996 --> 01:29:57,876
Watch out!

1056
01:30:04,354 --> 01:30:08,217
Hey, Sakagawea, or wea. Listen,
I need a favor. Somebody stole his tablet.

1057
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:10,932
You think you can track the guys
who took it?

1058
01:30:11,663 --> 01:30:15,839
He went east
but he lost control and crashed.

1059
01:30:16,365 --> 01:30:19,393
You're amazing. How can you tell that?

1060
01:30:23,569 --> 01:30:25,553
He left the wagon...

1061
01:30:25,657 --> 01:30:27,537
...and went back.

1062
01:30:27,641 --> 01:30:29,416
He went back?

1063
01:30:30,773 --> 01:30:32,130
Why would he go back?

1064
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:36,411
Get out of the way!

1065
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:46,122
You saved me.

1066
01:30:46,539 --> 01:30:48,628
You're worth saving, my dear.

1067
01:30:50,924 --> 01:30:53,535
-That's problematic.
-Teddy. Oh, man.

1068
01:30:53,743 --> 01:30:55,936
Larry, relax. I'm wax.

1069
01:30:56,145 --> 01:30:58,024
You gotta do something.
Dawn's approaching.

1070
01:30:58,233 --> 01:31:01,574
-Half the museum's running amuck outside.
-He's got my tablet.

1071
01:31:04,288 --> 01:31:06,376
Come on, Ockie!

1072
01:31:12,432 --> 01:31:14,311
At your service, Gigantor!

1073
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:16,609
How can we be of assistance, my liege?

1074
01:31:16,818 --> 01:31:19,011
Just give me a second, guys.

1075
01:31:23,187 --> 01:31:24,857
Rexy?

1076
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:27,572
Here, boy.

1077
01:31:27,676 --> 01:31:29,973
Teddy, I need a horse.

1078
01:31:30,078 --> 01:31:31,748
Do it, man.

1079
01:31:46,882 --> 01:31:50,537
-Come on, boy! Let me hear you yell!
-Yeah!

1080
01:31:50,745 --> 01:31:52,625
Just living the dream, baby!

1081
01:31:52,835 --> 01:31:54,401
I'm loving this!

1082
01:31:58,055 --> 01:32:00,247
Pull the stagecoach over now!

1083
01:32:03,066 --> 01:32:04,632
Can I make this turn up here?

1084
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:09,853
I'll take that as a yes. Hang on!

1085
01:32:16,326 --> 01:32:18,205
I can't hold it!

1086
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:33,141
Come on, Tex, let's finish this.

1087
01:32:34,707 --> 01:32:36,377
Come on!

1088
01:32:41,284 --> 01:32:42,955
Give me the tablet, Cecil!

1089
01:32:43,064 --> 01:32:44,525
Can't do it, son.

1090
01:32:47,971 --> 01:32:49,432
Pull over!

1091
01:32:49,637 --> 01:32:52,769
It ain't gonna happen. Moving on.

1092
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:56,214
Last chance, Cecil.
Stop the horses or I will!

1093
01:32:56,423 --> 01:32:58,302
They can't be stopped, Larry.

1094
01:32:58,511 --> 01:33:00,182
Don't you know your history?

1095
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:05,403
These are money carriers. They were trained
not to stop for anything but a secret word.

1096
01:33:05,612 --> 01:33:07,595
Really? You mean a word like...

1097
01:33:08,722 --> 01:33:10,414
..." Dakota"?

1098
01:33:15,113 --> 01:33:16,470
Come on, Tex.

1099
01:33:20,351 --> 01:33:22,647
I read up on my history.
Thanks for the tip.

1100
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:24,518
Oh, and by the way...

1101
01:33:24,727 --> 01:33:27,485
...don't ever talk to me like that
in front of my son.

1102
01:33:29,334 --> 01:33:31,004
Moving on.

1103
01:33:35,372 --> 01:33:37,251
-Hey, Huns.
-Tell Attila to have his boys...

1104
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:39,444
...take him back.
Put him with the guards.

1105
01:33:42,681 --> 01:33:45,396
Oh, and no limb ripping, okay?

1106
01:33:59,177 --> 01:34:00,848
Hey, boy. Wait, wait, hold the phone.

1107
01:34:01,057 --> 01:34:05,128
What's makeekaka mean?
Wait. Translation, please.

1108
01:34:06,903 --> 01:34:10,871
The year was 1909. I was going up
the Zambezi River in Africa.

1109
01:34:10,975 --> 01:34:14,107
And our river guide was a brilliant Pygmy
who spoke only by clicking.

1110
01:34:22,147 --> 01:34:23,505
There we are.

1111
01:34:27,163 --> 01:34:29,043
-Oh, boy.
-What is it?

1112
01:34:29,251 --> 01:34:31,340
I gotta get you guys
back to the museum.

1113
01:34:33,114 --> 01:34:34,367
How?

1114
01:34:37,082 --> 01:34:39,483
Ahkmenrah, I'm gonna need your help.

1115
01:34:39,588 --> 01:34:42,824
This is your tablet. You know
the instructions. You get everyone back.

1116
01:35:10,815 --> 01:35:13,738
Come on. There's somebody
who's gotta see this.

1117
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:19,580
What I'm saying is, for the type of money
that they pay A-Rod...

1118
01:35:19,789 --> 01:35:23,026
...he ought to be bringing home
a World Series trophy every season.

1119
01:35:23,548 --> 01:35:25,218
You know what I mean?

1120
01:35:43,699 --> 01:35:46,309
Now, who they gonna get
to clean up all that doo-doo?

1121
01:35:46,518 --> 01:35:47,667
-lnuit.
-Yeah.

1122
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:49,546
One terracotta soldier.

1123
01:35:49,650 --> 01:35:50,903
-Vikings.
-Right.

1124
01:35:51,008 --> 01:35:52,991
-Alpaca.
-Welcome back, ladies.

1125
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,766
-Llama.
-Hey.

1126
01:35:54,975 --> 01:35:56,332
Viking guys.

1127
01:35:56,437 --> 01:35:58,942
Do me a favor. Your fellows
made some funeral pyre...

1128
01:35:59,151 --> 01:36:01,239
...in Petrified Wood. Go clean that up.

1129
01:36:01,552 --> 01:36:02,910
Okay? Thank you.

1130
01:36:04,371 --> 01:36:06,983
-He's back.
-All right, I'll deal with this joker.

1131
01:36:07,191 --> 01:36:10,324
Hey, hey, Moose.
It's not gonna happen, buddy. All right?

1132
01:36:10,532 --> 01:36:12,828
I told you, you can't come through
with those antlers.

1133
01:36:12,829 --> 01:36:15,961
So you and your caribou buddy
gotta go around to the loading dock.

1134
01:36:16,066 --> 01:36:18,780
-Lawrence!
-Hey, Teddy.

1135
01:36:19,511 --> 01:36:21,077
Great to see you in one piece.

1136
01:36:21,286 --> 01:36:23,687
Sakagawea, a little hot wax,
and I'm a new man.

1137
01:36:23,896 --> 01:36:25,567
Larry?

1138
01:36:30,161 --> 01:36:32,458
I told you I wasn't making fun of you.

1139
01:36:32,562 --> 01:36:35,277
-I know.
-Teddy?

1140
01:36:36,738 --> 01:36:39,975
Oh, my God.

1141
01:36:40,706 --> 01:36:42,480
Wanna meet her?

1142
01:36:44,256 --> 01:36:45,405
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1143
01:36:45,614 --> 01:36:46,762
Okay, come on.

1144
01:36:46,971 --> 01:36:50,103
Excuse me. President Roosevelt,
this is my friend Rebecca.

1145
01:36:50,312 --> 01:36:51,982
-An honor.
-Hi.

1146
01:36:52,191 --> 01:36:54,071
And this is Sakagawea.

1147
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:55,428
-Wea.
-Wea.

1148
01:36:55,537 --> 01:36:56,704
Wea.

1149
01:36:57,103 --> 01:37:00,026
I think she has a few questions
she wants to ask you.

1150
01:37:01,801 --> 01:37:03,993
You rock. I am a big fan.

1151
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:07,026
What would you like to know?

1152
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:10,880
Well, I mean,
I don't know where to start, but....

1153
01:37:22,061 --> 01:37:24,567
-One Buddha.
-Check.

1154
01:37:26,133 --> 01:37:28,534
Two zebras.

1155
01:37:29,161 --> 01:37:32,502
-Right. Check.
-Dexter! Welcome back.

1156
01:37:32,710 --> 01:37:35,529
Hey, Dex, so look.
No hard feelings, all right?

1157
01:37:37,095 --> 01:37:38,662
-Lawrence!
-You saw!

1158
01:37:38,766 --> 01:37:41,063
-You saw what he did just then!
-Who's evolved?

1159
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,151
-I am.
-Who's evolved?

1160
01:37:43,255 --> 01:37:44,613
I am!

1161
01:37:45,657 --> 01:37:47,014
Good.

1162
01:37:47,745 --> 01:37:49,207
Well, they're all here.

1163
01:37:49,415 --> 01:37:50,877
Well done. Everyone's in.

1164
01:37:51,086 --> 01:37:52,756
Yeah, well...

1165
01:37:52,965 --> 01:37:54,740
...not everyone.

1166
01:37:55,889 --> 01:37:58,917
We lost a couple of good, little men
out there tonight.

1167
01:37:59,335 --> 01:38:03,302
With great victory comes great sacrifice.

1168
01:38:04,242 --> 01:38:05,808
Yeah.

1169
01:38:08,736 --> 01:38:10,615
Dad, look.

1170
01:38:16,462 --> 01:38:18,446
Bully!

1171
01:38:39,128 --> 01:38:41,529
You ain't getting rid of us that easy.

1172
01:39:01,888 --> 01:39:03,559
Until tomorrow evening, Lawrence?

1173
01:39:04,185 --> 01:39:06,482
Yeah. I don't know about that, Teddy.

1174
01:39:07,214 --> 01:39:09,511
It's gonna be tough
to talk my way out of this one.

1175
01:39:09,515 --> 01:39:11,603
Well, if that's indeed the case...

1176
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:13,691
...then it's farewell, my friend.

1177
01:39:15,871 --> 01:39:17,541
Nick?

1178
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:20,369
Your father's a great man.

1179
01:39:20,891 --> 01:39:22,457
I know.

1180
01:39:28,208 --> 01:39:29,879
Told you.

1181
01:39:33,324 --> 01:39:35,308
All right. Good night.

1182
01:39:35,412 --> 01:39:38,335
No, Lawrence. Good day.

1183
01:39:43,548 --> 01:39:45,427
Hey, Teddy?

1184
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:00,357
Thanks.

1185
01:40:13,934 --> 01:40:17,171
You're watching New York 1.
News all morning.

1186
01:40:18,528 --> 01:40:21,035
Thanks for joining us.
There is a fresh blanket of snow.

1187
01:40:21,244 --> 01:40:23,645
But it's not the snow
that's got New Yorkers talking.

1188
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:27,926
It's what's in the snow. There are
dinosaur tracks along West 81st Street.

1189
01:40:28,552 --> 01:40:31,893
Here's the remarkable video. These appear
to be Tyrannosaurus Rex tracks...

1190
01:40:32,102 --> 01:40:35,130
...and they lead straight
to the Museum of Natural History.

1191
01:40:35,652 --> 01:40:39,724
Authorities have found what appear to be
cave drawings in the subway.

1192
01:40:40,037 --> 01:40:43,169
Neanderthals atop the museum roof.
Elaborate hoax or publicity stunt?

1193
01:40:44,735 --> 01:40:46,614
You be the judge,
but one thing's for sure:

1194
01:40:46,614 --> 01:40:50,269
The folks at the Natural History Museum
have really outdone them--

1195
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:54,762
Any explanation at all?

1196
01:40:59,148 --> 01:41:00,819
No. Got nothing.

1197
01:41:01,028 --> 01:41:02,281
Good.

1198
01:41:02,803 --> 01:41:05,517
I'll take your keys and your flashlight.

1199
01:41:23,579 --> 01:41:25,667
Folks, this way.

1200
01:42:23,406 --> 01:42:27,373
My name is Nick Daley.
My Career Day parent is my dad.

1201
01:42:27,582 --> 01:42:30,714
He's the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1202
01:42:35,726 --> 01:42:37,709
Hey, how's it going? Well, Nicky said it:

1203
01:42:37,814 --> 01:42:40,320
I'm the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1204
01:42:40,528 --> 01:42:44,496
Let me tell you something:
That's when history comes alive.

1205
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:48,360
How many of you guys
have been over to the museum?

1206
01:43:09,136 --> 01:43:12,582
Goal!

1207
01:43:39,624 --> 01:43:42,025
Hey, it's getting late.
Are you ready to go home?

1208
01:43:42,756 --> 01:43:43,696
Nope.

1209
01:43:50,273 --> 01:43:51,839
Let's ride.

1210
01:44:29,426 --> 01:44:32,767
It was nice of Larry not to rat us out,
but this is ridiculous.

1211
01:44:32,872 --> 01:44:35,901
We're night watchmen, not janitors!

1212
01:44:36,109 --> 01:44:37,884
Gentlemen, you're doing a terrific job.

1213
01:44:37,989 --> 01:44:39,450
I'll gonna catch a few Z's.

1214
01:44:39,659 --> 01:44:41,121
You ain't going nowhere.

1215
01:44:41,225 --> 01:44:43,940
Start mopping, hot dog.

1216
01:44:48,325 --> 01:44:49,995
Over here.
