00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,030
W - O - R - K!

3
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,030
Work.

4
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,300
Today we're going to share
what our parents do for...

5
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:10,470
Work!

6
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,700
My Mummy is a doctor.

7
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,470
My daddy is a truck driver.

8
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,475
My Mum's a teacher.

9
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:17,740
And your dad?

10
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,270
Mmm... My dad...

11
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,885
He's... a liar.

12
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:29,890
A liar? Oh, I- I'm sure
you don't mean a liar.

13
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,726
Well, he wears a suit and goes
to court and talks to the judge.

14
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,095
Oh! I see.

15
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,394
You mean he's a lawyer.

16
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,939
Hey, Fletcher.
How'd it go?

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,108
Just another victory
for the wrongly accused.

18
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,609
Yeah, right.

19
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,079
Mr. Reede, great job.
Do you want your coat back?

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,514
No, I'm sure you'll be
needing it again and again.

21
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,949
Do you have a Mument?

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,185
I'm late. It's my day
to be with my son.

23
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:02,221
A couple of reporters want
to talk about your big win.

24
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,323
Yeah? How's my hair?

25
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,019
Fabulous. You look great.

26
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,743
What time is it?

27
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:27,077
I am sure your dad just
got held up in court again.

28
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,321
Dad!

29
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,085
Maximilian!

30
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,529
Hey, how you doing, creep?

31
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,691
Good.

32
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:50,503
Me too, except my arm
has been bothering me.

33
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,704
Oh, no, Dad!

34
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,039
Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,008
It's becoming a claw!

36
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:03,308
Nothing can stop the claw!

37
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:09,755
Run, boy, run!
Save yourself!

38
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,350
Do the claw to Mum!
Do the claw to Mum!

39
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,928
You found the claw's
only weakness.

40
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,397
Subzero temperatures!

41
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,235
So, did you have any trouble
finding the place?

42
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,372
Okay, I'm late. I'm sorry.
I ran out of gas.

43
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:30,976
The gauge is broken.
Rough neighborhood too.

44
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,145
Good thing I was wearing
neutral gang colors.

45
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,614
I might have had to pull out
my nine and bust a cap.

46
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,951
With my mind on my money
and my money on my mind

47
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,088
They would never hurt you,
Fletcher. You're their lawyer.

48
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:45,422
That was below the belt.
Keep the gloves up.

49
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,527
Mum, Dad's taking me
to see wrestling!

50
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,662
Oh, Fletcher!

51
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,497
Oh, Audrey!

52
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,500
Why do you have to take him to
see that stuff? It's very violent.

53
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,903
The boy must grow
to be a warrior.

54
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,873
Who better to guide him
than Rick Rude

55
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,577
and Randy "Macho Man" Savage
in the cage of death?

56
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,547
Oh, good!

57
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,149
Jerry, how's it going?

58
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,818
Hey, gipper!

59
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,121
You look like
you grow by the minute!

60
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,056
Fletcher, pleasure to see you.

61
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,820
Hi, honey!
Hi.

62
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:24,286
Wow. That was a nice image.
Deleted.

63
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,166
I have some more boxes
for you.

64
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,400
Oh, you're an angel.

65
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,969
Boxes?

66
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,305
Remember, I told you a few weeks
ago, Jerry's moving to Boston.

67
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:38,010
Oh, right! The job, the thing.
What do you do again?

68
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,445
Hospital administrator.

69
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,746
Right, right!

70
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,782
Well, the boxes are
in my car.

71
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,250
Oh, those can wait.

72
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:47,220
I made this young man
a promise, didn't I?

73
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,355
Got time to throw a few?

74
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,456
Sure!

75
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,118
Come on, then!

76
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,227
I forgot the boyfriend
was moving. Jerry!

77
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,430
His name is Jerry!
And yes, he's moving.

78
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,967
I'm sorry. I hated him less
than your other boyfriends.

79
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,435
It wasn't serious, was it?

80
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,237
Semi-serious, yes.

81
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,470
You guys aren't...
You know...

82
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,180
I have been dating him
for seven months.

83
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,247
What do you think?

84
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,049
Really?

85
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,818
I was hoping after being married
to me you'd have no strength left.

86
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,654
Remember,
when we were married,

87
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,056
I wasn't having sex
nearly as often as you were.

88
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,857
Ouch! And the ref
takes a point away.

89
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,329
Out!

90
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,855
Max is gonna miss him.

91
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,267
I'll be here.

92
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:39,605
Ready? Yeah! Play ball.

93
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,371
Max, come on. We've gotta go.

94
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,877
Dad, are we really
going to wrestling?

95
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,512
Absolutely,
Max Factor.

96
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,881
We just have to stop
by the office for one minute.

97
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,950
Excuse me, sir.
Any spare change?

98
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,942
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm all out.

99
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,221
I can't do it.

100
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:59,558
Fred, it's your duty to present
the strongest case possible.

101
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,127
The strongest case possible
consistent with the truth.

102
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,363
Will you let the judge
decide what's true?

103
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,900
That's what he gets paid for.
You get paid to win.

104
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,402
If you insist that
I take it to trial,

105
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:14,340
I will represent Mrs. Cole
aggressively and ethically.

106
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,502
But Miranda, I won't lie.

107
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,580
Then we'll just have
to find someone who will.

108
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,318
Twenty-first floor.
Men's wear.

109
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,691
Hi, Mr. Reede!

110
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,925
Hey. Did you do
something to your hair?

111
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,831
It's a bit extreme,
isn't it?

112
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,835
No! That's the thing
nowadays, right?

113
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,004
He said it would
accent my facial features.

114
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,105
That's what it does!

115
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,871
It completely accents
your facial features.

116
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,769
We're just gonna go
to my office...

117
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,649
Hey, Fletcher.

118
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,916
Hey, Pete.

119
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,084
You losing a little weight?

120
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,419
I don't know. Maybe.

121
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,022
Looks and personality.
A double-threat guy.

122
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,491
Hey, Mr. Reede.
Hey... man.

123
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:06,558
It's, uh, Randy.

124
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,660
Yeah, I know.

125
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,296
Taking lunch orders.
Anything?

126
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,662
No, thanks.

127
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,435
I had so much for breakfast,
I'm ready to pop.

128
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,237
I mean, I'm full.

129
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,707
Okay. Great.

130
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,145
Max!

131
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,713
Hi, Greta.

132
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,381
Hey, what's new?

133
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,518
It's my birthday tomorrow,
and we're having a party.

134
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,887
Wow! I am sure your daddy has
got you something wonderful.

135
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,423
Yeah?

136
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:41,588
Yeah, you bet!
Listen, kiddo.

137
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,762
Why don't you play
in my office for a minute.

138
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,065
Sue somebody for
everything they've got.

139
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:50,332
Maybe you can send a fax to one
of your girlfriends. Hey, sorry.

140
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,939
Damn it!
I completely forgot.

141
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,908
Oh, what a surprise.

142
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,178
You are a saint.
I should buy you a gift.

143
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,479
You did.

144
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,781
I always do the classy thing.
Any calls?

145
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,983
Judge Rawlings' clerk
needs your filing.

146
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,185
Tell him it's in the mail.

147
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,886
Right.
You'll do it next week.

148
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,153
Mr. McKinley phoned to
confirm your meeting tomorrow.

149
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,293
Strep throat. Some kind of
virus. What's going around?

150
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,327
Asian flu?

151
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,395
Good one.

152
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,997
And your mother called.

153
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,131
I'm on vacation.

154
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,399
It's your fifth week.

155
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,734
Snowed in.
Phones are down.

156
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,269
Break mother's heart.
Done. That's it.

157
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,103
Except Miranda's
looking for you.

158
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:31,944
How much ass do I have
to kiss to make partner?

159
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,546
Tell her I broke my leg
and I had to be shot.

160
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,538
Tell her yourself.

161
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,953
And then send out a notice
of judgment on my win today!

162
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,621
I'll get right on it.

163
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,291
Miranda!
Hey, I didn't see you.

164
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,861
You look beautiful today.

165
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,163
Here!
I bought you a gift.

166
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:55,431
Oh, thanks. I heard about
your victory. Congratulations.

167
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,430
You're making quite an impression
on the partnership committee.

168
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,308
That's right! You folks
are meeting soon.

169
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,177
I've been so busy, I haven't
even thought about it.

170
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,884
Anyway. I have
a client in my office.

171
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,585
Better not
keep him waiting.

172
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,886
Actually, something rather
important's just come up.

173
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,826
You're not busy tonight,
are you?

174
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,996
We're not going, are we?

175
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,645
Audrey. You know how there are
Muments you know are critical? Mmm-hmm.

176
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,522
And choices that
have to be made

177
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,624
upon which all one's
future happiness will depend?

178
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,718
Mmm-hmm.

179
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,251
This is one of those Muments.

180
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,959
What are you trying to say?

181
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,836
Will you marry me?

182
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,807
You're moving.

183
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,677
I know, but I want you
and Max to come with me.

184
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,812
Audrey, I've been giving this
a lot of thought.

185
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,149
You know I'm not prone to
wild flights of romantic fancy.

186
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,453
But the thought of you and I
togetherjust makes sense.

187
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,223
Now I'm ready. I think
you're ready. I love Max.

188
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,125
You love Max.
It's right. It fits.

189
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,592
So what do you say?

190
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,016
Hey, creepy. Happy birthday.

191
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,185
How old are you now, 22 or 23?

192
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,820
I'm five, Dad.

193
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,653
Okay.

194
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,458
Return the beer keg.

195
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,728
Cancel the dancing girls.

196
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,764
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

197
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,534
I feel completely
unprepared for this.

198
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,368
You see, I bought you
a present, but last night

199
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,406
I accidentally swallowed it.

200
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,041
Dad, it's in your belly!

201
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,271
Scalpel.

202
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,273
I hope it's not
partially digested!

203
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,578
Look out!

204
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,478
Cool! What is it?
Cool!

205
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,254
It's... It's a surprise.

206
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,020
All right, it's a pony.
Just open it!

207
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,987
I'm gonna help,
'cause I can't stand it!

208
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,832
Baseball stuff!

209
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,702
Cool! Can we play?

210
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,573
I'll be Nomo. You can be
Jose Canseco. Can we play?

211
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,274
Absolutely.

212
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,606
Yeah!

213
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,112
Right after your
party tonight, we'll do it.

214
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,513
You and me.

215
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,815
I just have to really
concentrate on this right now.

216
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,177
Hi!

217
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,914
Hey! Happy birthday.

218
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,148
Thanks, Mum.

219
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,981
Happy birthday, Max!

220
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:37,389
One, two, three, four, five.
And one for good luck!

221
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,691
He struck the child.
Did you see that?

222
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,159
Look at what Dad got me!

223
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,629
Whoa! Great!

224
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,398
Hey, I have
my glove in the car.

225
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,635
Maybe we can stop at the park
on the way home and play catch.

226
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,338
Then tonight we can rub oil in it
and wrap a big rubber band around it.

227
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,341
It'll be great.
Hey, great gift, Dad!

228
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,412
Thanks, son. I'm so glad my gift
could bring those two together.

229
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,405
My plan to phase myself out
is almost complete.

230
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,152
Something's come up,
and we need to talk.

231
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,554
Come on, Mum.
I want to go play!

232
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,824
And actually it's kind of important,
so maybe we could talk tonight?

233
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:13,925
Tonight?

234
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,027
Yes.

235
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,662
Max's birthday party.

236
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:17,829
Oh! Yeah.

237
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,766
Sure. Of course.
We'll talk then. Great!

238
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,836
Maximus! I'm outta here.

239
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:25,971
Bye, Dad.

240
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,373
Jerry, enjoy my wife.

241
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,025
Well, this is good.

242
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,327
This is really smart.

243
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,330
Thank you.
Only...

244
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,859
Well, it's not true.
Does that present a problem?

245
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,538
Mrs. Cole,
the only problem here

246
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:03,342
is that after you've provided years
of faithful service and loving support,

247
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,644
of raising his children,
they are his?

248
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:09,877
Huh? Oh. Yeah, yeah.
One for sure.

249
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,885
After all that, your husband
wants to deny you

250
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,556
a fair share of the assets
based on one act of indiscretion.

251
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,291
Seven.
Pardon me?

252
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,591
Seven single acts
of indiscretion.

253
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,933
Seven acts of indiscretion, only
one of which he has any evidence of

254
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,495
and all of which he himself
is responsible for.

255
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,004
He is?

256
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,906
Mrs. Cole.

257
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,844
You're the victim here. The wife
of a cold, distant workaholic.

258
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,713
Starved for affection, driven
into the arms of another man!

259
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,548
Seven.
Yeah, whatever!

260
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,017
You're not trying to deny him
what is rightfully his.

261
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,587
All you're insisting on
is what is rightfully yours.

262
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:52,624
Yeah.
And maybe a... fraction more.

263
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,227
I think you're bending
over backwards.

264
00:14:55,228 --> 00:15:00,365
Yeah. I did offer to give him
joint custody of the kids.

265
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,368
He is, after all,
a wonderful father.

266
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,099
And how does he repay you?

267
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,040
By dragging you through
a painful litigation process!

268
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,778
No, no, no, no!
This can't happen!

269
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,348
With all due respect, this isn't
about you and Mr. Cole anymore.

270
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,316
This is about all women.

271
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,686
Where would Tina Turner be right
now if she'd rolled over and said,

272
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:25,157
"Hit me again, Ike,
and put some stank on it?"

273
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,526
Rolling on the river,
that's where she'd be.

274
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:31,554
But she's beyond Thunderdome,
because she decided to send a message.

275
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:36,768
Wake up, sisters! There's no

276
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,399
such thing as a weaker sex!

277
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,009
You know what?

278
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,513
You're right, Mr. Reede. I am
tired of getting kicked around!

279
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,183
Good for you!

280
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:55,314
Thank you. I am so grateful

281
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,690
to have an attorney
I can trust.

282
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,032
Oh, you are good.

283
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,066
You are very, very good.

284
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,074
The Cole case is worth a
truckload of money to this firm.

285
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,375
If you win, I guarantee
you'll make partner.

286
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:26,418
In fact, how would you like to make

287
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,910
a partner right now?

288
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,715
Oh, I don't know. I should...

289
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,033
Happy, happy, happy
happy, happy, happy

290
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:46,738
Happy
I'm so happy today

291
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,306
I live in the USA

292
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,808
So honey?

293
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,210
Have you thought about...

294
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,279
You know,
what we talked about?

295
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,082
Yeah. I can't go.

296
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,017
What? Why not?

297
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,785
Because of Max.

298
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,654
But he'll love it there.

299
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,823
I'm gonna take him
to Fenway Park.

300
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,025
There's hiking and camping...

301
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,621
Well, really,
it's... Fletcher.

302
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,565
Fletcher? Come on, honey.

303
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,934
He wouldn't even come over
unless you reminded him.

304
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,837
I know, but when he does
come over, Max is so happy.

305
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,039
It's like they have their
own little world together.

306
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,941
The gipper and I
have that too!

307
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,967
I know, but it's different.

308
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,211
How?

309
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,736
Well...

310
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,915
He does the claw.

311
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,183
The what?

312
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,413
The claw.

313
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,014
You know, it's like this...

314
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,722
I don't...

315
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:44,229
Run for you life.
It's the claw! The claw!

316
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,636
I can't really do it that
good. That's not the point.

317
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,128
The point is

318
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,675
if they're 3,000 miles apart,
they're never gonna see each other.

319
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,010
Fletcher's never gonna
come to Boston.

320
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,647
Hello.
Audrey?

321
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,983
Fletcher! Where are you?

322
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,147
We're waiting. Max won't cut
the cake until you get here.

323
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,422
Oh, man!

324
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,224
Actually, something
has come up. I've...

325
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,427
I've got this problem
on a new case.

326
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,062
What happened?
Nothing!

327
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,497
I stubbed my toe on the desk!

328
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:23,201
I'm really sorry,
but I just can't make it.

329
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,570
The boss is, uh,
really riding me.

330
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,574
Fletcher, it's his birthday!

331
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,610
I know, I know.

332
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,378
I'll make it up to him,
I promise.

333
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,246
I'll pick him up
from school tomorrow, okay?

334
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,348
You're gonna pick him up?

335
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,515
Yes!

336
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,418
All right, hold on a minute.
You can say happy birthday.

337
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,945
No! Gotta go! Goodbye.

338
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,391
Hello.

339
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:50,629
Happy birthday to you

340
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,867
Happy birthday, dear Max

341
00:18:55,868 --> 00:19:01,204
Happy birthday to you

342
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,940
Okay, birthday boy.
Make a wish.

343
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,816
Come on, Max.
It can be anything you want.

344
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,047
Anything in the whole world.

345
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,965
Max.

346
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,636
Your father is sorry.
He had to work.

347
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,509
He said he was gonna
be here. He promised.

348
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,813
I know, but he promises that
he is gonna see you tomorrow.

349
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:46,274
Okay? He's gonna pick you up
from school. All right?

350
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:52,383
So come on. Make a wish.

351
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:09,133
I wish that for only one day
Dad couldn't tell a lie.

352
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:40,863
That was incredible.

353
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,709
Was it good for you?

354
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,144
I've had better.

355
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,215
"I've had better"?

356
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,693
"I've had better"?

357
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,500
"I've had better"?

358
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,124
Hi.
Hi.

359
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,194
New in the building?

360
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,729
Yeah,
I just moved in Monday.

361
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,165
Oh! You like it so far?

362
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,500
Mmm-hmm.
Everybody's been real nice.

363
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,537
Well, that's because
you have big jugs.

364
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,739
I mean, your boobs are huge.

365
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,208
I mean, I wanna squeeze them.

366
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:53,978
Mama.

367
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,192
Any change, mister?

368
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,393
Absolutely.

369
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,594
Could you spare some?

370
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:10,695
Yes, I could.

371
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,364
Will you?
How come?

372
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,533
Because I believe you will
buy booze with it!

373
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,402
I just wanna get
to the office

374
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,872
without being confronted by
the decay of Western society!

375
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,140
Plus, I'm cheap!

376
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,744
Jerk-off!

377
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,444
You look like you're
having a rough morning.

378
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:03,245
Ding, ding, ding! What do
we have for her, Johnny?

379
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,283
Fletcher.

380
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,547
Dana.

381
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,486
All right, Samantha.

382
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,255
How much will it take
to put an end to all this?

383
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,990
Fifty percent
of your estate.

384
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,392
Fifty percent?

385
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,829
With a pre-nup and proof of
adultery? What's your case?

386
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,128
Our case is simply this.

387
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,442
Very funny, Fletcher!

388
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:08,313
You wanna play hardball?
I'm game.

389
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:11,316
"You wanna play hardball?
I'm game. "

390
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,052
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

391
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:18,122
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Marshall Stevens.

392
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,190
Honorable?

393
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:27,065
Good morning.
Call case number BD-00305.

394
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,934
Samantha Cole v. Richard Cole.

395
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,669
How are we doing this morning,
Counsel?

396
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,171
Fine. Thank you.

397
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,739
And you, Mr. Reede?

398
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,199
I'm a little upset about a
bad sexual episode last night.

399
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:45,416
Well, you're still young.
It'll happen more and more.

400
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:49,081
In the meantime, what do you
say we get down to business?

401
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,924
First, Mr. Reede, I see...

402
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,126
I would like a continuance!

403
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:58,997
This case has been delayed
several times, Mr. Reede.

404
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:03,731
I realize that, Your Honor, but I
would really, really like a continuance.

405
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,099
I'll have to hear good cause,
Counsel.

406
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,470
What's the problem?

407
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,719
I can't lie!

408
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,922
Commendable, Mr. Reede, but
I'm waiting to hear good cause.

409
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,624
Do you have one or not?

410
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,725
Not.

411
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,820
Motion for continuance denied.

412
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,830
Is there any chance
of a settlement in this case?

413
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,132
I don't think so,
Your Honor.

414
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:38,503
My client has already offered
Mrs. Cole $2.4 million.

415
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:41,305
But Mr. Reede has made it
clear he has no desire...

416
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,540
Settle!

417
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,242
Settle, settle,
settle, settle!

418
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,077
I don't want to settle.

419
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:50,548
Mr. Reede. You convinced me
yesterday, I'm the victim!

420
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,485
I'm starved for affection. I'm
driven into the arms of another man.

421
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,587
Seven!
Yeah, whatever.

422
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,724
With the story you came up
with, I don't think we can lose.

423
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,859
I want to proceed.

424
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,295
Mrs. Cole,
you don't understand.

425
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,731
Mr. Reede.
Do we have a settlement?

426
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,700
No!

427
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,038
No, Your Honor.

428
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,632
There's no settlement.

429
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,843
Trial to commence 1:30 sharp.

430
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,830
It was me!

431
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,803
Hi, Mr. Reede!
Like the new dress?

432
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,535
Whatever takes the focus
off your head.

433
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,076
What's up, Fletcher?

434
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:55,346
Your cholesterol, fatty!
Dead man walking.

435
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,781
Hey, Fletcher.
Hey!

436
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,149
You're not important enough
to remember.

437
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,250
What's it gonna be,
Mr. Reede?

438
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,918
A pockmark, eventually!

439
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,355
Don't ask!
For God's sakes, don't ask.

440
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,225
All right.
You can beat this.

441
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,751
It's all a matter
of willpower!

442
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,121
A test. Something small.

443
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:23,937
Red. Red. All right?
Now focus.

444
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,577
The color of this pen is...

445
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:33,815
The color of this pen is...

446
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:46,190
The color of the pen
that I hold in my hand is...

447
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,526
royal blue!

448
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,066
One lie, and I can't say it!

449
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,044
I'll write it.

450
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,667
Write it! Write it,
or I'll break it off!

451
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:40,818
No! Come on! Stop it.

452
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,265
Boss? What happened?

453
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,205
The pen is blue.
The pen is blue!

454
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:05,104
The goddamn pen is blue!

455
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,947
Mr. Reede,
are you all right?

456
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,682
I gotta go home.

457
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,351
Home?
Was the case settled?

458
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:16,082
No! I have to be
in court at 1:30!

459
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,155
Then how are you
going to go home?

460
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,425
I don't know. I don't know.

461
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,329
Okay. Mr. Reede,
Reuben and Dunn called.

462
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,332
They need to know where the
Darby settlement offer stands.

463
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,166
I just proposed a settlement
to dick with them!

464
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,773
Dick with them. Got it.

465
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,508
And your mother called.

466
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,909
Are you still on vacation?

467
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,311
No.

468
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,413
Then you're here?
Yes.

469
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,382
Thank you for clearing
that up, sir.

470
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,250
And your ex-wife called.

471
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,686
She wants to know when you're
coming to pick up your son.

472
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:51,247
Oh, I'm such a shit!

473
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,130
Hello.
Audrey?

474
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,966
Fletcher, hi. Are you still
picking Max up from school today?

475
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,035
Here's the thing.
I really can't!

476
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,137
I had a case I was
certain would settle,

477
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,205
and it didn't,
and I have to go to court.

478
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,768
Right. It's true! I really
want to see Max today!

479
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,078
I really do.

480
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,514
But things just keep coming up
at the last minute.

481
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:17,915
Yes, but this time
it's different.

482
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,583
I see. How is that?

483
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,052
Now I'm telling the truth.

484
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,453
And last night you weren't.
No.

485
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,754
Well, what were you doing?

486
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,621
Having sex!

487
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,727
Well, I hope that it was
with someone very special.

488
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:33,097
No! That's the thing. I don't
even like her, but she's a partner.

489
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:36,200
I thought I could help my
career by making her squeal.

490
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,608
What's wrong with me?

491
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,841
I'm getting what I deserve.
I'm reaping what I sow. I'm...

492
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,357
Is Dad still picking me up?

493
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,384
No, Max, he's not.

494
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:06,430
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
pick you up, okay?

495
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,399
I'll work it out.

496
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,568
I guess my wish
didn't come true.

497
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:11,802
What wish?

498
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:15,406
I wished that forjust one day
Dad couldn't tell a lie.

499
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,980
Max?

500
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:29,954
I have something important
to talk to you about, okay?

501
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:31,479
Okay.
Okay.

502
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,031
Hello?

503
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:44,201
Audrey! Let me explain.
Something has happened to me.

504
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,337
Well, something else
is about to happen to you.

505
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,005
Max and I are
moving to Boston.

506
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,106
What?

507
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,441
Jerry has asked me
to marry him,

508
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:53,377
and Max and I are going this
weekend to look at houses.

509
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,045
I thought it was semi-serious!

510
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,982
It's just been given
a violent shove into serious.

511
00:31:57,983 --> 00:32:00,551
You can't move to Boston,
I'll never see Max!

512
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:04,021
You'll have the same relationship
you have with him now, won't you?

513
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,856
Where are you?
I'm going home.

514
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:09,126
When you get there, just stay there.
I'm coming over. We have to talk.

515
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,255
Fletcher!
I'll be right there.

516
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,733
Hey, Mr. Reede...

517
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,239
Fletcher.
Holy hell!

518
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:35,283
You can run,
but you can't hide.

519
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,760
What's your problem, schmuck?

520
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:45,491
I'm an inconsiderate prick!

521
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,222
Oh, shit!

522
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,387
Shit!

523
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,503
You know why
I pulled you over?

524
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,269
Depends on how long
you were following me!

525
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,908
Why don't we take it
from the top?

526
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:33,577
Here goes.

527
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,779
I sped, I followed too
closely, I ran a stop sign,

528
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,449
I almost hit a Chevy, I sped
some more, I failed to yield,

529
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,445
I changed lanes without
signaling while speeding!

530
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,623
Is that all?

531
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,818
No.

532
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,185
I have unpaid parking tickets.

533
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,694
Be gentle.

534
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,172
Audrey! Wait!

535
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,512
Wait, Audrey. Hold on. Wait!

536
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:12,883
Wait. I just had an insight
into myself. I'm crazy.

537
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,620
You call and say,
"Wait, I'll be right over,"

538
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,089
and here's the crazy part,
I actually wait.

539
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,257
I can explain this.

540
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,227
I have missed
a department meeting.

541
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,329
Did you come in a cab?
Yes!

542
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,059
Where's your car?

543
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,303
Thank you! I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

544
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,506
I can. $1,654.11.

545
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,669
How do you sleep at night?

546
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,742
I'm taking this.

547
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,018
You scratched my car!

548
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,194
Where?

549
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,028
Right there!

550
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:04,157
Oh, there.
That was already there.

551
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,271
Why, you...

552
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,873
You liar!

553
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,675
You know what
I'm gonna do about this?

554
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:12,776
What?

555
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,714
Nothing! Because if I take you to court,
it'll drain eight hours out of my life,

556
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:17,881
and you won't show up,

557
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,417
and if I got the judgment,
you'd just stiff me anyway!

558
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,954
So I'm gonna piss and moan
like an impotent jerk

559
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,448
and then bend over
and take it up the tailpipe!

560
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,826
You been here before,
haven't you?

561
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,198
Well, I can't remember
when I've had more fun,

562
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,500
but if you'll excuse me,
I have a class.

563
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,569
Are you marrying this guy
because you're mad at me?

564
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,971
No, I divorced you
because I was mad at you.

565
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,439
Wait. I want to
talk about this!

566
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,974
What do you want to say?

567
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,411
Is this guy right for you?
He is so not me!

568
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:48,979
That's one of his
best qualities.

569
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,116
But he's kind of a magoo.

570
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,251
I'm sorry.
You're wrong.

571
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,854
Sometimes
maybe he is a little...

572
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,288
Magoo!

573
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,457
Yes. But since
we've been going out...

574
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,459
My God, I'm not having this
conversation with you.

575
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,694
Audrey, you can't go.

576
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:04,895
This is not fair.

577
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:05,996
Fair?

578
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:11,135
Okay, let's define fair. Last
night a 5-year-old boy was crushed

579
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:15,105
because his father lied to him
about coming to his birthday party.

580
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,207
Fair?
Last night...

581
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,542
Was none of my business.
Thank you.

582
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,710
None of my business.

583
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:23,280
Two years ago, it was my business.
But I don't have to care anymore.

584
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,850
That's the magic of divorce.
But it matters to Max!

585
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,287
Everything you do matters,
and everything you don't do.

586
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,589
All right. Now let me
tell you something.

587
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,559
I'm a bad father!

588
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:39,396
I mean...

589
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,468
I'm a bad father.

590
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:53,277
You're not a bad father,
when you show up.

591
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:56,180
What if I come right
after court and play ball?

592
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:59,349
Then you and I can talk before
you make any rash decisions!

593
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,318
No, we are leaving tonight.

594
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,688
Please, Audrey.
Give me one more chance.

595
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,191
I'm throwing myself
on the mercy of the court.

596
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:12,357
I lost you, but please
don't make me lose Max, too.

597
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:18,402
Give me a chance to be the
father I started out to be.

598
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,676
You're really coming?

599
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,544
This is ironclad.

600
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:31,315
This is the mother of
all promises. What time?

601
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:32,883
Okay, 6:00.

602
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,017
5:50.

603
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,385
All right.

604
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:39,323
All right. But if I tell Max
that you're coming,

605
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:42,793
and you don't show up and I have
to see that look on his face,

606
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,523
that heartbreaking look,

607
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,764
we're going to Boston.

608
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,768
If I don't show up,
I'll pack you myself.

609
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:54,304
I will lovingly wrap your
nicknacks with bubble paper.

610
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,967
I hope so.

611
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:01,108
Do you know what your son
was doing at Ā·:15 last night?

612
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,982
He was making a birthday wish
that forjust one day

613
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,951
his father couldn't
tell a lie.

614
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,925
Oh, my God! That's it!

615
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,029
"I do not like them, Sam I Am.

616
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,727
"I do not like green eggs
and ham.

617
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,568
"Would you like them here
or there?

618
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:25,669
"I would not like them... "

619
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,035
Excuse me.

620
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,675
Hi. I'm Max's bad father...
I'm his father.

621
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:32,943
Dad!

622
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,914
Could I borrow him
forjust one second?

623
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,615
Monster Max!

624
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,818
You came to play catch?

625
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,820
I'd like to, but I can't.
I gotta talk to you.

626
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:48,292
Your Mummy told me about that wish
you made last night. It came true, Max.

627
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,360
Really? You mean you
have to tell the truth?

628
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:51,495
Yes.

629
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,297
No matter what?
No matter what!

630
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,531
Is wrestling real?

631
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,600
In the Olympics, yes.
On channel 23, no.

632
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,169
Will sitting too close to
the TV set make me go blind?

633
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,637
Not in a million years.

634
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,707
If I keep making this face,
will it get stuck that way?

635
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,808
Uh-uh.

636
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,971
In fact some people
make a good living that way.

637
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,150
Now listen, Max. You've
gotta do something for me.

638
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:15,886
I need you to
take back that wish.

639
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,254
So you can lie?

640
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:18,388
Yes.

641
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,325
But not to you.
You see, Max,

642
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,226
sometimes grownups
need to lie.

643
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,664
It's hard to explain,
but if...

644
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,536
Look, here's a good example.

645
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,505
When your Mummy was pregnant
with you, she gained 40 pounds,

646
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,040
there was nothing
she wouldn't eat.

647
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,543
And Daddy was scared. But when
she'd ask me, "How do I look?"

648
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:43,981
I'd say, "Honey, you look
great. You're glowing. "

649
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:45,649
If I had told Mummy
she looked like a cow,

650
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,817
it would have
hurt her feelings.

651
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:47,985
Understand?

652
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:50,520
My teacher tells me
real beauty's on the inside.

653
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,116
That's just something
ugly people say.

654
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,193
Max, no one can
survive in the adult world

655
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,928
if they have to
stick to the truth.

656
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:00,197
I could lose my case,
I could lose my promotion,

657
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:01,965
I could even lose my job.

658
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,268
Now, I need your help, Max.

659
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,403
Okay.

660
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,707
Okay. Do whatever
you did last night,

661
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:15,043
only this time,
make it an "unwish. "

662
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,522
I did it.

663
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:26,820
Excellent!

664
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,027
Now, I just need
a little test.

665
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:50,380
Did it work?

666
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,680
Not like I'd hoped.
Did you unwish it?

667
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:54,551
Only...

668
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,953
What? Only what?

669
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,456
Yesterday, when I wished it,
I really meant it.

670
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,621
This time when I unwished it, I
only did it 'cause you told me to.

671
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:08,298
All right. Do it again.
And this time, mean it.

672
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,399
But I can't!

673
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,834
Why not?

674
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,436
'Cause I don't
want you to lie.

675
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,204
I explained this.

676
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,641
I have to lie.
Everybody lies.

677
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,044
Mummy lies.
Even the wonderful Jerry lies.

678
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,171
But you're the only one
that makes me feel bad.

679
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:29,411
Max, recess is over.
Come on in!

680
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:36,293
Mum says we're
moving to Boston.

681
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:39,763
That isn't for sure yet.

682
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:42,597
She promised
we'd talk about it tonight.

683
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,464
I am coming!

684
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,037
You believe me,
don't you, Max?

685
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,202
I'll see you later, buddy.

686
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,753
Fletcher. How's it hanging?

687
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:05,450
Short, shriveled
and always to the left.

688
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:12,896
Boss, it's Skull.
He knocked over another ATM.

689
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:16,561
This time at knife-point.
He needs your legal advice.

690
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,468
Stop breaking the law,
asshole!

691
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,518
Boss, are you all right?

692
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,953
My son hates me.

693
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:42,718
Max loves you. I've seen you
together. You're his hero.

694
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:44,792
Oh, yeah?

695
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:49,733
Last night at his birthday
party, he made a wish

696
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:53,068
that I wouldn't be able to lie
for one whole day.

697
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:54,738
Kids.

698
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,899
It came true.

699
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,705
What?
Max's wish!

700
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:00,936
It came true.

701
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,754
Boss, maybe you should
just take a few days off.

702
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:15,158
Greta! Didn't it seem weird to you that
I kept telling the truth all morning?

703
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:17,193
Well, yeah. But...

704
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,732
What are you saying? That
you are incapable of lying?

705
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,136
That's right!
I am incapable of lying!

706
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,704
Just for today?

707
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,440
Apparently.
'Til Ā·:15 tonight.

708
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,535
It's one of those
24-hour curses.

709
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:34,678
Those are going around.

710
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:35,879
You don't believe me, do you?

711
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,380
Of course not.

712
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:40,650
How ironic!

713
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:44,821
Okay. Ask me something you
think I would normally lie about.

714
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:49,025
All right. Remember a couple of
months ago when I wanted a raise?

715
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:52,295
I don't want to do this. And
the company wouldn't give me one

716
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,232
and I asked if you would give
it to me out of your own pocket.

717
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:57,801
And you said the company
would not allow it,

718
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:01,605
because it would create jealousy
among the other secretaries.

719
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:06,566
Was that true, or did you just
not want to pony up the dough?

720
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,248
Greta, please!

721
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:15,819
Judge Stevens, hi! Fletcher Reede. I'm
scheduled in your court in half an hour.

722
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,923
Judge Stevens, I badly,
badly need a continuance. lll?

723
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:23,827
Am I ill? That is the perfect
question for you to ask.

724
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,228
Please lie for me!

725
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,530
I remember when you bought me

726
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:29,728
this antique frame from
Tiffany's... Tiffany's?

727
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:33,937
Garage sale. $6.50,
marked down from ten.

728
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,368
I'll give you the raise!

729
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,278
Here's your raise.

730
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,483
Hi, Judge Stevens! I know I
haven't given you an answer.

731
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:49,553
But illness could mean
so many things.

732
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:52,148
Can you hold?
Hello? Mum!

733
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:56,219
Hi! I wasn't really
on vacation.

734
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,995
Because I didn't
want to talk to you!

735
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:03,166
Because you insist on talking about Dad's
bowel movements, size, color, frequency!

736
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,932
I'll call you later! Hello?

737
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,572
Oh, damn it! I cut him off.

738
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:11,406
I cut off the judge!

739
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,648
Greta! Don't leave!

740
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:22,313
I'm on my knees
in a $000 suit!

741
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:28,725
Mr. Reede. Several years ago, a
friend had a burglar on her roof.

742
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:33,630
He fell through the skylight, landed
on a butcher's knife, cutting his leg.

743
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:37,200
The burglar sued my friend.
He sued my friend!

744
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,436
Because of guys like you,
he won!

745
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:43,873
My friend had to pay the
burglar $6,000. Is that justice?

746
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:47,242
No.
I'd have got him $10,000.

747
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,946
Goodbye, Mr. Reede.

748
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,047
No, wait!

749
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,783
I didn't understand!
Ask me again!

750
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,051
Have a nice day in court.

751
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,213
Greta!

752
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,921
Hi.
God in heaven!

753
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:03,026
It's nice to see you too,
Fletcher. Are you busy?

754
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:04,094
Extremely.

755
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,154
Good. Would you
follow me, please?

756
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,502
Did you know
that the partnership committee

757
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,494
is headed by
Mr. Allan himself?

758
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:18,371
You used to work directly
for Mr. Allan. Yeah.

759
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,344
Tell me.
What do you think of him?

760
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,582
He's a pedantic, pontificating,
pretentious bastard!

761
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:26,750
A belligerent old fart!

762
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:30,380
A steaming pile of cow dung!
Figuratively speaking.

763
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,182
Really? How delightful.
This way.

764
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:40,355
Pardon me for interrupting. Mr.
Allan, you remember Fletcher Reede?

765
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:44,434
Oh, yes! Nice to
see you again, Fletcher.

766
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:47,604
I'll be observing you
in court this afternoon.

767
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:50,540
I've been hearing
some good things about you.

768
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:55,479
Well, Fletcher has just been
telling me how much he thinks of you.

769
00:46:55,646 --> 00:47:00,049
Why don't you tell Mr. Allan?
Well, what do you think of him?

770
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,827
He's a pedantic, pontificating,
pretentious bastard!

771
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:15,459
A belligerent old fart. A
worthless, steaming pile of cow dung.

772
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,534
Figuratively speaking.

773
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:43,026
That's the funniest damn thing
I've ever heard!

774
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,428
You're a real card, Reede!

775
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,796
I love a good roast!

776
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,126
Do Simmons!

777
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,903
Simmons is old!

778
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,473
He should have been
out years ago,

779
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:59,568
but he can't stay home
'cause he hates his wife!

780
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:02,779
You've met her
at the Christmas parties.

781
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,943
She's the one that gets
plastered and calls him a retard.

782
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:10,620
And you, Tom. You're the
biggest brownnose I've ever seen!

783
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,655
You've got your head so far
up Mr. Allan's ass,

784
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:15,490
I can't tell where
you end and he begins!

785
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,650
Priceless!

786
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,298
You have bad breath
caused by gingivitis.

787
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,300
You couldn't get
a porn star off.

788
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,137
Your hairpiece looks like
something that was killed.

789
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:31,472
I don't know whether to comb it or
scrape it off and bury it in lime!

790
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:37,013
Loser! Idiot! Wimp!
Degenerate!

791
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,278
Slut!

792
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:45,622
I like your style, Reede! That's
what this stuffy company needs!

793
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:47,223
A little irreverence!

794
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:50,057
Good! I'll see you later,
dick-head!

795
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,731
Dick-head! Priceless!

796
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,383
Keep your eye on that boy.

797
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:14,817
Dick-head!

798
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,975
Third District Court
is now in session.

799
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:43,243
The honorable Judge
Marshall Stevens presiding.

800
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,281
Afternoon, Counselors.

801
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,318
Are we ready to begin?

802
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,719
No, sir!

803
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,490
We are not ready to begin
because my client has not arrived!

804
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,558
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!

805
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,394
Here she comes
to wreck the day

806
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,696
Mr. Reede!

807
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,164
Sorry, Your Honor.

808
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:05,932
Go, go, go. Lupe, you keep those kids
quiet. I'm not even close to kidding.

809
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:09,772
Sorry. Billy threw up
in the car.

810
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,875
You brought your kids
to your divorce?

811
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:13,977
Sympathy.
Well, it's working.

812
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:15,678
I feel sorry for them already.

813
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,114
Miss Appleton,
you may begin.

814
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:21,484
From March 6 through June 12

815
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:25,188
I surveilled Mrs. Cole
at the behest of Mr. Cole.

816
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:30,491
During that period, I noted that Mr.
Cole left each day between 7:40 and 7:50.

817
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,364
Thereafter Mrs. Cole
would frequently have

818
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:38,392
a male visitor arrive and stay
from one to four hours.

819
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:43,640
I was able to take several
photographs of the male visitor.

820
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:44,904
I see.

821
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:50,246
Do you know what Mrs. Cole
and her male visitor did

822
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:53,308
during these frequent visits?

823
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,619
Well, they were pretty good
about keeping the shades drawn,

824
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:01,285
but I was able to make a
recording of one such session.

825
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,963
Your Honor, as you are aware, under
the terms of the prenuptial agreement,

826
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:10,923
if Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
she is entitled to nothing.

827
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:16,102
With your permission, we'd like to
play the following tape recording.

828
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,079
Here comes big daddy!

829
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,082
OĀ£, God! Do it to me!

830
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,919
Do it to me! Harder! Harder!

831
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,694
Oh, come on!

832
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:39,696
Your Honor,
how can it be proved

833
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:43,466
that the male voice on that
tape is not Mr. Cole himself?

834
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:47,270
You are such a better lover
than my husband!

835
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,172
Your Honor, I object!

836
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:50,873
And why is that, Mr. Reede?

837
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,642
It's devastating to my case!

838
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:53,843
Overruled.

839
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,209
Good call!

840
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,748
I gotta go.
I haven't cleaned your pool.

841
00:51:58,749 --> 00:51:59,949
Your witness.

842
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,145
All right.

843
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,714
Well, Mr. Reede,
you may proceed.

844
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,188
How?

845
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:41,324
Your Honor, would the court be willing
to grant me a short bathroom break?

846
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,425
Can't it wait?

847
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:44,193
Yes, it can.

848
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,562
But I've heard that if you hold it,
it can damage the prostate gland,

849
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:49,863
making it very difficult
to get an erection!

850
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,668
Is that true?

851
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:52,966
It has to be.

852
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,406
Well, in that case, I better
take a little break myself.

853
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:59,706
But you get back here
immediately so we can finish this.

854
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:20,289
How am I going to
get out of this?

855
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:25,001
Think. Think.

856
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:26,492
Think!

857
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:27,230
What the hell are you doing?

858
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:32,627
I'm kicking my ass!
Do you mind?

859
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,962
I found him like this
in the bathroom, Your Honor.

860
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,064
Somebody beat
the hell out of him.

861
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,232
Who did this?

862
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,997
A madman,
Your Honor!

863
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:08,404
A desperate fool at the end
of his pitiful rope!

864
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,173
What did he look like?

865
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:14,210
About 6'2", 1Ā·0 pounds,
big teeth, kind of gangly.

866
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:16,312
Bailiff, have the deputy
search the building.

867
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,906
Yes, sir.

868
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:21,476
Order! Order!

869
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:29,859
Under the circumstances, I have
no choice but to recess this case

870
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,728
until 0:00 a. m.
tomorrow morning.

871
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,927
Unless, of course, you
feel you can still proceed.

872
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,202
Can you?

873
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:50,979
Yes, I can.

874
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:54,116
I admire your courage,
Mr. Reede.

875
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:57,253
We'll take a short recess so
that you can compose yourself,

876
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:59,382
and then we'll get started.

877
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,224
Here you go.

878
00:56:23,347 --> 00:56:25,178
Hello?
Dad?

879
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:27,950
Max? How's it going?

880
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:30,820
Great. You know Paul and
Emanuel from across the street?

881
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:31,988
Yeah.

882
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:34,590
Well, they never want
to play baseball with me.

883
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,926
But I told them I'm
playing tonight with my dad.

884
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,428
So now they want to play.
Is that okay?

885
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:42,265
Sure. The more the merrier.

886
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:44,900
Coolest! Do you
wanna be Jose Canseco?

887
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:49,272
Oh, yeah. Who else is gonna
hit that famous Nomo slider?

888
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:50,573
Mr. Reede.

889
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,808
I gotta go now, Max.

890
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:56,178
I'll see you in a
couple hours. Okay? Bye.

891
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,442
Bye, Dad.

892
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:02,351
He's really coming!
I'm gonna go change.

893
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,452
Okay, go ahead!

894
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,422
Yeah!

895
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,552
Mr. Reede!

896
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,959
"Mr. Reede! Mr... "

897
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,726
This is my lawyer.
He's a little unorthodox.

898
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,906
Mr. Reede, you remember Kenneth
Falk, the man from the tape.

899
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:25,074
How could I forget?

900
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:26,609
Hey, how you doing?

901
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:30,413
I've slipped into the seventh
circle of hell! Thank you. You?

902
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:32,882
Shouldn't we be going over
our testimony right now?

903
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:36,052
Basically, the plan is,
I walk you through the tape.

904
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:38,354
Step-by-step,
I ask you questions.

905
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:41,023
And we give the explanation
you came up with.

906
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:42,325
Exactly.

907
00:57:42,326 --> 00:57:44,260
All we gotta do is lie.
That sounds simple enough.

908
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:46,320
Doesn't it!

909
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,631
Then I'll finish up
with dramatic questions.

910
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,266
Something like,

911
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:55,805
"Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you
and Mrs. Cole have never made... "

912
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,483
Oh, God!
I can't do it.

913
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:11,580
I can't finish the question
if I know the answer is a lie.

914
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,398
You may proceed, Mr. Reede.

915
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:44,648
Respondent calls...

916
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:48,515
Kenneth Falk.

917
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:07,877
Raise your right hand.

918
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,011
Do you swear
to tell the truth,

919
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,213
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

920
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,707
I do! I mean...

921
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:18,950
I do.

922
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,296
Mr. Falk.

923
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:34,770
Do you know my client,
Samantha Cole?

924
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,000
Yes.

925
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:44,580
Isn't it true that your relationship
with my client is entirely platonic?

926
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,606
I object, Your Honor!

927
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,575
To yourself?

928
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:51,253
Yeah.

929
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:55,214
But I would like to
rephrase the question.

930
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:01,297
Mr. Falk, would I be accurate

931
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:05,468
if I described your relationship with
Mrs. Cole as totally professional?

932
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:08,771
I object, Your Honor,
and I move to strike!

933
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:13,767
Mr. Reede, I don't know what you're on,
but you better get to the point and quick.

934
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,943
Thank you, sir.

935
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:24,120
Is your relationship with
my client entirely platonic?

936
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,755
Not! Is not your
relationship with my client,

937
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:30,159
"Boink! Bad baby, bad baby!"

938
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,428
Did you ever not make...

939
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:33,929
Did you...

940
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,498
Mr. Reede!

941
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:39,735
You had sex with her every time you
met, didn't you? Didn't you! Liar!

942
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:40,870
He's badgering the witness.

943
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:42,004
It's his witness.

944
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:45,007
You slammed her! You dunked her
donuts! You gave her dog a Snausage!

945
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,534
You stuffed her like
a Thanksgiving turkey!

946
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,782
All right, it's true, okay!
I humped her brains out!

947
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:55,752
There! Now you happy?

948
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,889
No further questions.

949
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,404
No questions.

950
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:28,046
You may step down.

951
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:35,556
Do I dare ask you to
call your next witness?

952
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,592
I have no further witnesses,
Your Honor.

953
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,800
What are you doing?
Call me!

954
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:47,937
You do not understand.
I can't lie.

955
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:51,206
I can't do anything dishonest
until Ā·:15 tonight!

956
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,276
Listen, you bastard!
I want my money!

957
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:57,479
I am not going to end up a
31-year-old divorcee on welfare

958
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,349
because my scumbag attorney had
a sudden attack of conscience!

959
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:03,585
Thirty-one?

960
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,689
If Mr. Reede has
no further witnesses,

961
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,925
then I have no choice
but to rule in favor of...

962
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,360
Your Honor!

963
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:16,596
I call Samantha Cole
to the stand.

964
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,970
Order.

965
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:23,772
Order! Order!

966
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:24,907
Knock it off!

967
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,171
Sit down!

968
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:30,579
Mr. Reede, it is out
of sheer morbid curiosity

969
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,481
I'm allowing this
freak show to continue.

970
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:39,779
Mrs. Cole if you dare.

971
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:56,403
Mrs. Cole,

972
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:01,200
is this a copy of
your driver's license?

973
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:04,446
Yes.

974
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,507
It says here you're a blonde.
Are you?

975
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:09,685
If you don't remember,
perhaps Mr. Falk will.

976
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:10,786
Brunette.

977
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,388
We can play the tape again.
Maybe it's on there.

978
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:14,448
I'm a brunette!

979
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,726
Thank you.
Now let's see.

980
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:21,563
"Weight, 105."
Yeah! In your bra.

981
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,699
Your Honor, I object!
You would!

982
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,767
Bastard!
Hag!

983
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:27,703
Quiet! Overruled! Weight?

984
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:30,973
118.

985
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,610
All right, fine, fine.
I'm 127.

986
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:40,049
And it says here you were born in
1964, but that's not true either, is it?

987
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,817
Is it!
No.

988
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:46,088
Will you tell me what it says here on your
birth certificate under "Date of birth"?

989
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:48,724
Your Honor, what does this
have to do with anything?

990
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:51,660
Overruled. Mrs. Cole,
answer the question.

991
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,029
"1965."

992
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:58,196
Now let me get this straight.

993
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:03,472
That would mean that you lied about
your age to make yourself older.

994
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:07,943
But why would any woman
want to do that?

995
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:10,479
I changed it
so I could get married.

996
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,350
And the truth
shall set you free!

997
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,820
My client lied about her age!

998
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:21,423
She was only 17 when she got
married, which makes her a minor,

999
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:23,258
and in the great state
of California,

1000
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:28,464
no minor can enter into any legal contract
without parental consent, including...

1001
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:30,065
Prenuptial agreements.

1002
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:33,535
Prenuptial agreements!
This contract is void!

1003
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:37,372
The fact that my client has been ridden
more than Seattle Slew is irrelevant.

1004
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,174
Standard Community Property
applies,

1005
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,210
and she is entitled
to half of the marital assets,

1006
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:44,179
or $11.305 million!

1007
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:48,481
Jordan fades back. Swoosh!
And that's the game!

1008
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,982
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

1009
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,995
Order. Order. Order!

1010
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:09,838
In light of this new evidence, the
court must rule in favor of Mrs. Cole.

1011
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,006
Yes!

1012
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:13,635
She is hereby awarded
half the marital assets.

1013
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:17,846
The son of a bitch
pulled it off!

1014
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:19,548
I didn't know!

1015
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:21,677
It doesn't matter.
The contract's void.

1016
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:23,285
Order.

1017
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,846
Order.

1018
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:30,325
I understand both parties
have agreed to joint custody.

1019
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:31,794
Is that correct?
Yes.

1020
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:33,462
Yes.
No.

1021
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,397
I'm contesting custody.

1022
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:36,465
What?

1023
01:05:36,466 --> 01:05:38,033
If I get sole custody,

1024
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:40,636
that's another 10 grand
in child support payments.

1025
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:42,437
You just won $11 million!

1026
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,574
Hey, I'm the victim here.
You said it yourself.

1027
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:48,101
Now I'm gonna hit him
where it hurts.

1028
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:53,748
But you... You said
he was a good father.

1029
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:55,346
So?

1030
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:02,848
Well, Mr. Reede, do we have
an agreement on custody or not?

1031
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:07,720
No.

1032
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:09,659
I see.

1033
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:16,004
In that case, there will be a custody
hearing on the 10th at 0:00 a. m.

1034
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,996
Court is adjourned.

1035
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,381
Come on, let's go.

1036
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,449
Daddy!

1037
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:30,319
You stop that whining, or I'll
give you something to whine about!

1038
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,354
I wanna go with Daddy!

1039
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:35,924
Come here, kids. Come on. It's
all right. Don't you worry.

1040
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:39,088
I promise we'll be together,
whatever I have to do.

1041
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:41,096
It's okay. It's okay.

1042
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:44,166
Oh, for God's sake, will you
give me those? They're mine!

1043
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,935
Let go of Daddy! Let go
of him! Let go of Daddy!

1044
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:50,339
We're leaving now!
Lupe, come on!

1045
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:54,572
Don't you have some checks to
write? You haven't paid for them yet.

1046
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:09,658
I love children.

1047
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:12,361
They give you so much
leverage in a case like this.

1048
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:15,593
You did an incredible job,
partner.

1049
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:22,003
Look at him. He's stunned.
He can't believe it.

1050
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:28,010
Your Honor, may I please
approach the bench?

1051
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:29,945
We're adjourned,
Mr. Reede.

1052
01:07:29,946 --> 01:07:33,482
Your Honor, I think
we've made a big mistake.

1053
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:36,485
Mr. Reede,
I am tired and very cranky.

1054
01:07:36,486 --> 01:07:40,322
I know, but this is
just... wrong, isn't it?

1055
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:42,491
I manipulated the system.

1056
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:46,261
Just because you bought it doesn't
mean I'm right. It's a technicality!

1057
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:49,631
Young man, having my judgment
mocked in my own court

1058
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:52,134
is not something
I'm prepared to tolerate!

1059
01:07:52,135 --> 01:07:56,371
Well, tell that to the kids when
they're adopted by the Manson family!

1060
01:07:56,372 --> 01:08:00,576
One more word out of you, Mr.
Reede, and I'll hold you in contempt!

1061
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,845
I hold myself in contempt!

1062
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:05,847
Why should you
be any different?

1063
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,316
Bailiff, take him away!

1064
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:11,019
This man is a good father,
and children are not leverage!

1065
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,390
Oh, no, don't do this! I have
a date to play ball with my son!

1066
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,894
I can't be late!
It's my last chance!

1067
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:24,791
I'm Jose Canseco!

1068
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:29,972
Phone call!
Phone call!

1069
01:08:29,973 --> 01:08:32,339
I get a phone call!
I get a phone call!

1070
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:34,838
I get a phone call!

1071
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:37,813
Hello?

1072
01:08:37,814 --> 01:08:40,315
Audrey, it's me.
Don't hang up!

1073
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,918
I can't talk right now.
Our flight leaves at 8:00.

1074
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:44,052
What?

1075
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:47,155
I'm taking Max someplace where
you can't do this anymore.

1076
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:50,392
Audrey, wait! The most amazing
thing has happened to me.

1077
01:08:50,393 --> 01:08:51,693
I Swear, I'm a changed man!

1078
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:54,823
Just come to the courthouse
with $1,000 and bail me out.

1079
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:57,966
Hello? Hello?

1080
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,335
Time's up, pal. No, just one
more call. Just one more call.

1081
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,068
Okay, let's go.

1082
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:10,545
Ready?
Yeah.

1083
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:11,980
Will you get the door, please?

1084
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,108
Okay.

1085
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,248
Thank you.

1086
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:19,612
Mr. Reede, you made bail.

1087
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,991
Greta! Oh, thank God!

1088
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,894
Am I too late? Have you
been sexually molested yet?

1089
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:28,421
Because I could
circle the block.

1090
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:31,633
How did you know
I was here?

1091
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,468
One of the other secretaries
called me at home,

1092
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:35,971
said you went all noble
in front of Mr. Allan.

1093
01:09:35,972 --> 01:09:38,640
Yeah, I think I'm fired.
Isn't that great?

1094
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:41,209
I'll start my own firm.
Do you need a job?

1095
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,236
I don't think
you can afford me.

1096
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,519
Oh, man, I gotta get my car.
Audrey's on her way to the airport.

1097
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,286
I could lose Max forever. I
can't let that happen. I love him!

1098
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,558
You know, this truth stuff
is pretty cool.

1099
01:09:56,559 --> 01:10:00,826
I love my son!
I love my son!

1100
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:04,794
I love my son!
I love my son!

1101
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:08,765
Hey, need some change?
Take everything!

1102
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,701
But it's not gonna
make you happy.

1103
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:20,245
I love my son!

1104
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:23,585
Hey, there you are!

1105
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:26,154
Hi.
Just in time.

1106
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:29,148
Oh, this is the happiest
Mument of my entire life.

1107
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:35,397
Well, me... Mine...
Well, ours... also.

1108
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:39,791
Hey, gipper. I have
something for you, young man.

1109
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:43,967
Watch yourself.
It's the claw!

1110
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,441
The claw's coming at you.

1111
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:49,742
You're scared of the claw.
You're scared of the claw.

1112
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:52,714
Jerry. Jerry.

1113
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:53,849
Huh?

1114
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,584
It's okay.
You don't have to...

1115
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:59,248
Tower Air flight 1511
to Boston is now boarding.

1116
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,323
That's us.
Yeah.

1117
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:02,424
Ready to go?

1118
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,359
Yes. You ready?

1119
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,627
Okay.
Great.

1120
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:07,653
Jim Rubing, please report
to Airport Security.

1121
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:16,399
Excuse me!

1122
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:19,708
What gate is flight 1511
leaving from? It's an emergency!

1123
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:23,078
Gate number 123, but you'll never
make it. Flight's already boarding.

1124
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:25,547
It takes more than a half hour
to get through security.

1125
01:11:25,548 --> 01:11:26,715
If you want to go to Boston,

1126
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:29,151
there's another flight leaving
tomorrow morning at 7:00 a. m.

1127
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:30,813
Flight number 12...

1128
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:37,292
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard flight 1511

1129
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,628
from Los Angeles
to Boston's Logan Airport.

1130
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,029
We'll be departing shortly,

1131
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,165
and if you need help stowing
your carry-on items...

1132
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:45,361
Honey, can I help you?
I'm fine.

1133
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:49,102
Are you sure?
Jerry, I can open the bag!

1134
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,208
Would you like anything
to drink before takeoff?

1135
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:56,338
Yes. Anything with alcohol,
please.

1136
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:57,943
Audrey.

1137
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:02,984
If you'll focus on the screen,
we'll be running a safety video.

1138
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,681
How about that drink?

1139
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,343
Max! Max!

1140
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,312
Max!

1141
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,316
Wait!

1142
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,219
That ought to do it.

1143
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,363
Hey!

1144
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,924
Thanks! It's running great!

1145
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:55,632
Max!

1146
01:12:59,442 --> 01:13:03,674
Hey! Max!

1147
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,039
Hey!

1148
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:21,020
Max! I'm coming!

1149
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:32,973
Max!

1150
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:45,544
Max! Max, where are you?

1151
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,685
I love you.

1152
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:56,298
Thank you.

1153
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:00,302
That wasn't exactly
the answer I was looking for.

1154
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,796
Thank you very much?

1155
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:09,844
I'm sorry.
It's just...

1156
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:10,946
Too fast?

1157
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,080
It was too fast, wasn't it?

1158
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:13,315
No, it's...

1159
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:15,483
Chemistry? Whatever it is,
we can work on it.

1160
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:18,053
No, no, no.
It's just that...

1161
01:14:18,054 --> 01:14:20,088
Oh, my God, it's Fletcher!

1162
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,691
No, no, this has nothing
to do with Fletcher.

1163
01:14:22,692 --> 01:14:24,025
No, honey, it's Fletcher.

1164
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,627
What?

1165
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,255
Dad?

1166
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:32,464
I made it! I'm late,
but I made it!

1167
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,670
What is he doing?

1168
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:38,868
He came to see us off.
Wave.

1169
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:44,907
I won't let you go!

1170
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:54,486
Oh, shit!

1171
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:03,523
Control one-nine, this is Tower
1511, heavy. Ready for takeoff.

1172
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,892
Hey!

1173
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:12,207
What was that?

1174
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,402
Looked like a shoe.

1175
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:16,277
Pull over!

1176
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:18,880
Pull this thing over!

1177
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:21,449
Control one-nine, some idiot
has hijacked a flight of stairs.

1178
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:22,984
We're gonna stop this plane.

1179
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:24,715
One-nine Control. We copy.

1180
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:29,885
Yeah!

1181
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,224
No!

1182
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,469
You people are all
doing a wonderful job!

1183
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:15,637
That's far enough, folks.

1184
01:16:15,638 --> 01:16:18,540
He's my husband.
Was my husband.

1185
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:20,175
All right, go ahead.
Okay.

1186
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:23,475
Max, you stay here with Jerry,
and I'll be right back, okay?

1187
01:16:26,849 --> 01:16:29,651
Audrey! Great news!
Fletcher!

1188
01:16:29,652 --> 01:16:32,854
Both my legs are broken, so
they can't take me right to jail.

1189
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:35,690
Fletcher, what were you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

1190
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:40,695
No, I'm thinking clear.
I've never been this clear!

1191
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:42,263
Dad?

1192
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,096
Creep.

1193
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,534
He was getting kind of upset.

1194
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:48,169
Are you all right?

1195
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:52,403
Yeah. I'm hurting here,
though.

1196
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:54,570
I'm a dope, Max.

1197
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:59,681
All this time you've been here and I
could see you anytime, but I didn't.

1198
01:17:00,883 --> 01:17:02,917
Then your Mum told me
you were moving to Boston,

1199
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:04,919
and I started thinking.

1200
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:09,221
I could be sitting around
sometime and want to look at you

1201
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:12,124
and hold you
and play with you,

1202
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:14,929
and I won't be able to.

1203
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:19,560
I don't think I'm gonna
do too well with that.

1204
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:24,072
I love you more than anything
else in the world, Max,

1205
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:26,474
and you know it's true.

1206
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,672
I couldn't say it if it
wasn't true. Not today.

1207
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:36,618
I love you,
and I'll never hurt you again.

1208
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:43,691
He's telling the truth, Mum.
He's not allowed to lie.

1209
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:47,462
I made a wish, and anything Dad
says today has to be the truth.

1210
01:17:47,463 --> 01:17:49,397
Max.

1211
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:52,934
It's 8:45.

1212
01:17:52,935 --> 01:17:55,303
You made the wish at 8:15.

1213
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:58,171
I've been able to lie
for the last half hour.

1214
01:17:58,541 --> 01:17:59,607
So you weren't...

1215
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,676
No, it was the truth!

1216
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:05,636
I just wanted to be honest with you.
I always want to be honest with you.

1217
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:16,119
Mum, do we have to
go to Boston?

1218
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,763
No, Max,
you don't have to go.

1219
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,593
Yeah!

1220
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:29,934
I, on the other hand,
do have to.

1221
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:32,397
A hospital to run.

1222
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:36,805
That's an open-ended ticket
if you ever change your mind.

1223
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,006
Thank you.

1224
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,816
Looks like
he's got his father back.

1225
01:18:56,265 --> 01:19:00,101
Happy birthday, dear Maximus

1226
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:06,303
Happy birthday to you

1227
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:08,509
Okay, Max,
make a wish.

1228
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:12,480
Wait! I don't know
if we should do this.

1229
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:16,509
Oh, Fletcher, come on. What are
the odds of that happening again?

1230
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,922
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1231
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:23,016
Okay, Max, go ahead.

1232
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:32,291
Mum? Dad?

1233
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:50,118
Max!

1234
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:56,958
Did you wish for your Mum and
I to get back together again?

1235
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:59,394
No, I wished for Rollerblades.

1236
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:06,134
Do you want to
cut the cake,

1237
01:20:07,703 --> 01:20:09,003
Dad?

1238
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,665
I'd love to.

1239
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:14,075
But I have this horrible pain
in my arm.

1240
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:15,910
Oh, no, it's the claw!

1241
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:17,879
No one can stop the claw!

1242
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,274
No one can stop it!

1243
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:31,925
Nothing can stop the claw!

1244
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:58,820
If I was a boxer, I would bounce
those things like Sugar Ray Leonard.

1245
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:00,220
I'm sorry.

1246
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:04,292
Brought your kids
to your divorce?

1247
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:06,227
Sympathy.
Well, it's working.

1248
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,458
I feel sorry for them already.

1249
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:11,996
For this you will
pay a terrible price.

1250
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:18,231
Well, it's working!
I feel sorry for them already.

1251
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,488
Mrs. Cole.

1252
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:47,925
A goose.

1253
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,507
Including...

1254
01:21:52,508 --> 01:21:54,142
Prenuptial agreements.

1255
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:58,045
Prenuptial agreements.

1256
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:06,918
No. I'd have got him $10,000.

1257
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:09,457
Goodbye, Mr. Reede.
No, wait!

1258
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,655
I didn't know she had...

1259
01:22:35,485 --> 01:22:37,450
Oh, shit.

1260
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:43,660
Now, let's see.
"Weight, 105"?

1261
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,625
Yeah! In your bra.

1262
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:47,495
Your Honor, I object!
