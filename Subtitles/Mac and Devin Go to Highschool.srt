1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,234
And stay out!

3
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,103
Man, this girl is trying
to fuck up my day.

4
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:18,372
Talkin' about she want
to watch a romantic comedy.

5
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:20,075
Get the fuck outta here!

6
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:21,309
I ain't watchin' no lovey-dovey,

7
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:23,243
funny bunny ass shit with her.

8
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:25,813
Anyway, sorry everyone.

9
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:28,148
Let me properly
introduce myself.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,122
My name is Slow Burn,

11
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:36,856
and I am your movie guide.

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,857
We will be watching

13
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:39,393
"Mac and Devin
Go To High School"

14
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:43,030
starring Snoop Dogg
and Wiz Khalifa.

15
00:00:43,063 --> 00:00:44,999
But before we get started
with the picture,

16
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:48,034
I would like to make sure
everyone is comfortable

17
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,903
and properly prepared.

18
00:00:49,936 --> 00:00:51,405
We all know the regular routine.

19
00:00:51,438 --> 00:00:52,506
Go the bathroom,

20
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:53,673
turn off your annoying-ass
cell phone,

21
00:00:53,707 --> 00:00:54,841
get a big ass popcorn,

22
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:56,376
and a cup of ice-cold
carbonated sugar water--

23
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,411
Baaah.

24
00:00:57,444 --> 00:00:58,578
Wrong.

25
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:00,346
You missin' one key
ingredient, nigga.

26
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:02,349
How you gonna watch
a motherfuckin' weed movie

27
00:01:02,382 --> 00:01:04,083
without no motherfuckin' weed?

28
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:05,819
Get your papers, your bongs,
your bowls, your blunts,

29
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:07,554
some fat- ass nugs
of that Good-Good

30
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:09,455
and spark that shit up!

31
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:11,224
Now, if you unfortunate
right now,

32
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:13,760
and don't have any weed,
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:16,095
But please,
stop this movie right now.

34
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:17,263
It just won't work,

35
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:18,264
you can't watch
this shit without no weed.

36
00:01:18,297 --> 00:01:19,465
Stop.

37
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:20,999
You don't play baseball
without no bat, do you?

38
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:23,001
Exactly.

39
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:24,804
For the same reason
you don't watch a Three-D movie

40
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:26,305
without Three-D glasses.

41
00:01:26,339 --> 00:01:27,406
So go figure that out,

42
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,308
then put your goddam
ganja goggles on,

43
00:01:29,342 --> 00:01:30,576
and get ready for lift-off.

44
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:31,577
Thank you, kindly.

45
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,711
And without further ado,

46
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:35,181
I would like to present,

47
00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:36,515
"Mac...

48
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,217
and Devin Go To High School."

49
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:43,321
Hold on!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

50
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:46,425
For all of you that like to play
those movie weed games,

51
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:49,027
like smoke every time
so and so character

52
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:51,029
says this or does that,

53
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:53,966
here's the official
weed game for this movie.

54
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:57,536
Take a hit every time
you see a character on screen

55
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,106
either walkin', talkin',
or breathin'.

56
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:03,975
Matter of fact, let's do
one together right now.

57
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:10,215
Yeah.

58
00:02:10,248 --> 00:02:12,650
That's what the fuck
I'm talkin' about.

59
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:13,685

00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:33,348
Do we have a problem
with this student?

321
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:35,383
Not anymore.

322
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,018
Because you do know
that all expulsions

323
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:39,654
are handled by me,
personally.

324
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:45,560
Yes, but this student always
seems to get off with you.

325
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:48,296
Does he?

326
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,298
Uh, do you mind giving us
a few minutes?

327
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,867
But this is my office.

328
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,936
Yeah, do you want it
to remain your office?

329
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,072
Yes, Principal Cummings.

330
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,144
Oh, Mr. Johnson.

331
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:07,114
What have you done this time?

332
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,551
You are such the naughty,
naughty little student.

333
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:12,486
What am I gonna do with you?

334
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:19,392
You always make me have
to punish you so severely.

335
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:23,163
Always getting me riled up!

336
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,132
<i>[ knock on door ]</i>

337
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,500
We need to see who that is.

338
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,771
Well, you just meet me
in my office after school today

339
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,607
and we're gonna take
care of that little bit

340
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,775
of unfinished business, okay?

341
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,046
Hello.

342
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,683
I'm sorry, do you work here?

343
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,019
Uh, actually,
this is my place of business.

344
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,220
Can I help you?

345
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,554
I'm Miss Huck,
the new substitute teacher

346
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,956
for AP Chemistry.

347
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:53,292
I know a thing or two
about chemistry.

348
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,661
Excuse me?

349
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,062
What is it that you do here?

350
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,730
I'm Mr. Johnson,
the Athletic Director.

351
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,265
Okay.

352
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,767
Hopefully I'll see you around
the campus later on today.

353
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,872
It's past fourth period,
Poindexter.

354
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,574
I promise you
I'm going to get it.

355
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,575
Ow!

356
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:10,576
Right there.
Let's go.

357
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:11,944
What are you doing?
Huh?

358
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,313
Hit that.

359
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,348
Let me get that,
let me get that.

360
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,849
Yes, Sir.

361
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:21,553
That's some- that's some
powerful stuff right there.

362
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:22,720
Yes, Sir.

363
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,056
I like- I like that
right there.
Yes, Sir.

364
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,025
Improper use of lab glassware
is a hazard, you know?

365
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,260
Did you know that
motherfuckin' outfit

366
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,495
you got on
is a style hazard?

367
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:31,796
What are you doing here, anyway?

368
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,266
You're not smart enough
to be in this class.

369
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:35,768
And how you know?

370
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,003
'Cause you been in high school
for like a half a century.

371
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:43,040
Mr. Johnson.

372
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:45,442
Class, I'm Ms. Huck,
your new substitute teacher

373
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:47,345
for the rest
of the semester.

374
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,346
Wait.

375
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,082
What happened to Mr. Luznar?

376
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,250
Mr. Luznar met with a rather
tragic chemical accident.

377
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:55,119
I've spoken
with your teacher

378
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:57,389
and he wants you all
to present a research project

379
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:59,357
for your final grade.

380
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,793
Partners are as follows.

381
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:04,461
Harding and Pell.

382
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:08,700
Suzuki and Ofaso.

383
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,668
Ofaso.

384
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:13,070
Jones and Greenberg.

385
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:16,540
And Overstreet and Johnson.

386
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:18,710
What?

387
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:20,111
W- with all due respect,

388
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:23,180
this pairing could jeopardize
my entire future!

389
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:28,518
<i>Well, Miss Huck, I've been
looking forward to meeting you.</i>

390
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:32,589
I'm the Assistant Principal,
Ralph Skinnfloot.

391
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:33,857
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Skinnfloot.

392
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,358
Charmed.

393
00:16:35,392 --> 00:16:39,362
If you need anything at all,
please, don't hesitate to ask.

394
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:42,299
And if you have any problems
with this one, just let me know.

395
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,634
Thank you.

396
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:47,003
By the way, I'd love
to welcome you with my staff.

397
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:48,971
I- I mean, to the staff.

398
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:50,706
Over dinner.

399
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,308
I don't think
that's appropriate.

400
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:54,410
So, a maybe?

401
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:57,747
Very encouraging.

402
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:08,123
Yo!

403
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,625
Mac!

404
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:13,930
Hey, Mac!

405
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:15,331
Mac!

406
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:19,869
Mac!

407
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:22,571
<i>Overstreet!</i>

408
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:24,774
It's down to two.

409
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:28,811
Two geniuses banging brains.

410
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:30,879
Only one can stand and come.

411
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:32,781
What are you talking about,
Mahatma?

412
00:17:32,814 --> 00:17:35,217
That's Mahatma Chang Greenberg
to you.

413
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,586
Learn it.

414
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,488
'Cause come graduation day
when I, and not thee,

415
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:41,523
assume the position
of Valedictorian,

416
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:43,191
that will suck for you.

417
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:44,192
Oh, really?

418
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:45,360
'Cause last time I checked,

419
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:47,930
I'm still number one
in the class.

420
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:49,931
Yeah, well I'm taking
like seven AP classes.

421
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:52,967
You get an A-minus
and your ass is mine.

422
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:54,202
You hear me?

423
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:57,239
What do you want with my ass,
Mahatma?

424
00:17:57,272 --> 00:17:58,740
My brain is gonna
do all types of things

425
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,976
to your ass
come graduation day.

426
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,677
Fuckin' nerd.

427
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:11,786
I need you to uh, check me into
that AP Chemistry class

428
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,054
with Miss Huck.

429
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:14,055
You know I got you, Mac.

430
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,055
I always do.

431
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:16,757
Fo sho.

432
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,759
Mac.

433
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:18,760
What's up?

434
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:19,861
Man, we need
to study tonight.

435
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:21,829
Study. Yeah.

436
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:24,031
Get at me at nine o'clock
on the corner of "Why Dontcha"

437
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:26,366
and "BlowMe"?

438
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:27,936
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

439
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:29,670
What do you say, you, me,
and little buddy

440
00:18:29,703 --> 00:18:30,904
right here make three?

441
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:33,641
I'm sorry,
I don't date students.

442
00:18:33,674 --> 00:18:35,408
Well, I guess I'll just
have to drop out.

443
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:39,880
I don't date liars either,
Mr. Athletic Director.

444
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:41,149
Let me apologize for that.

445
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:42,350
How can I make it up to you?

446
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:43,350
Can I take you out on a date?

447
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:45,052
You want a date with me?

448
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:48,888
You need to graduate
high school first.

449
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,725
And I'll be confiscating this
in the meantime.

450
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:56,737
Mm.
Good goobly goo.

451
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:04,104
Let the learning begin.

452
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:07,707
<i>You can't smoke in here,
young man.</i>

453
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,909
Hey, don't worry about it, baby,
I got a medical condition.

454
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,779
What condition is that?

455
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:16,015
I got an addiction.

456
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:19,251
I'm addicted
to Granny Punany.

457
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,222
Really?

458
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:23,523
Yeah.

459
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:31,397
What are you doing here?

460
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,466
Man, you was right, D-Street.

461
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,802
That graduation thing
is important.

462
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:37,937
Guess you finally came
to your senses.

463
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,005
Just hook me up
the knowledge, College.

464
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:43,976
Oh, yeah?

465
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,677
Start here.

466
00:19:48,414 --> 00:19:49,848
Dang it.

467
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,720
Gimme my candy, motherfucker.

468
00:19:54,753 --> 00:19:55,721
What's up, super freak?

469
00:19:55,754 --> 00:19:56,788
I'm sorry, man.

470
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,957
I just get low
on blood sugar and...

471
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,991
Come on!

472
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:00,992
Relax. Relax.

473
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:02,060
Fuck.

474
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:04,029
I got just want you need.

475
00:20:05,297 --> 00:20:06,265
You ain't gonna eat that?

476
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:07,833
We can go half and half.

477
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:09,801
A toast to expanding minds.

478
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:15,640
Yo, thanks man.

479
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,610
I needed that.

480
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:20,711
More than you'll ever know.

481
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,713
A quick lesson on weed edibles.

482
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:24,849
Snacks made with cannabis, i.e.

483
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:26,785
weed brownies, cookies,

Hey, Big Mac.

654
00:27:24,524 --> 00:27:25,726
How you doin', sexy?

655
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,927
Good, mamacita.

656
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:28,329
Just showing my brother
from another mother

657
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:29,497
the way of the weed.

658
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,665
All right.

659
00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:31,999
So what'll it be?

660
00:27:32,032 --> 00:27:33,400
It'll be the usual.

661
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,303
Let me get uh, two Scooby Snacks
with special sauce on it.

662
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:37,637
Comin' right up.

663
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:38,973
Oh, yeah, baby.

664
00:27:39,006 --> 00:27:40,775
Yo, I really needed this, man.

665
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:43,043
Shit. Every motherfucker
needs this.

666
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:45,545
'Cause I've been stressed
over this stupid speech, man.

667
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:47,314
The Valley Dictorian, right?

668
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:48,348
Yeah.

669
00:27:48,382 --> 00:27:50,017
And everybody expects
me to talk about

670
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,087
the good times I had
in high school--

671
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,221
But you ain't had
no good times.

672
00:27:54,254 --> 00:27:56,623
Exactly.

673
00:27:56,656 --> 00:27:58,391
Here you go.
Thank you, baby.

674
00:27:58,424 --> 00:27:59,760
Two Scooby Snacks.

675
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:01,061
So you do this all the time?

676
00:28:01,095 --> 00:28:02,796
Every minute
of the motherfuckin' day.

677
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:04,163
So you don't worry
about the future?

678
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:05,699
No, D.

679
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:07,300
I vast in the moment.

680
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,601
Man, I wish I could do that.

681
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:09,868
You can, homey.

682
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:11,938
All you got to do,
is do what I do.

683
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:13,607
Say what I say.

684
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,874
You know, like so what?

685
00:28:14,908 --> 00:28:16,375
So what we get drunk?

686
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:17,743
So what we smoke weed?

687
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:19,378
So what we get high?

688
00:28:19,412 --> 00:28:20,713
We don't care who see.

689
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:22,682
You got to live young,
you got to live wild,

690
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:24,417
you got to live free.

691
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,252
You got to do you
like I do me.

692
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:27,686
You dig?

693
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:30,222
<i>How the fuck
did we get here?</i>

694
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:31,891
We flew, nigga.

695
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:33,126
You ready to get some ink?

696
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:35,661
Aw, I don't know, Mac.

697
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:37,863
You said you wanted to
experience some shit, right?

698
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:39,365
Yeah.

699
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:42,167
But what if it hurts?

700
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,903
You might like that.

701
00:28:43,937 --> 00:28:45,471
[ buzzing ]

702
00:28:57,783 --> 00:28:59,184
Come on in, dawg.

703
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:06,725
Man, this spot is crazy.

704
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:12,197
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

705
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,398
Now this is where
the shit goes down.

706
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:16,902
You got your sativa,
you got your indica,

707
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:19,404
and you got your hybrids
over there.

708
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:22,006
You have know idea what the fuck
I'm talking about, huh?

709
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,208
No.

710
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:25,811
Don't trip.

711
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:27,245
I got exactly what you need.

712
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,484
Hey, ladies and gentlemen.

713
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:37,088
I am your friendly neighborhood
weed plant, Captain Kush.

714
00:29:37,122 --> 00:29:38,523
That's right.

715
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:41,525
And on today's Volume One
of the Captain Kushhopedia,

716
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:44,928
we will be discussing two
different strains of marijuana.

717
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:45,996
That's right.

718
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:48,900
Cannabis Indica
and Cannabis Sativa.

719
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:50,134
Keep it locked.

720
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,836
Press pause
and I'm whoopin' your ass.

721
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:54,004
Ah, shit, what time is it?

722
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:55,239
Shit, I don't know.

723
00:29:55,272 --> 00:29:56,873
I forgot my books at school.

724
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:58,342
Books?

725
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:01,012
I usually start my late night
study session right about now.

726
00:30:01,045 --> 00:30:03,947
I usually start my late night
bong session right now.

727
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,849
Pull that out,
hit that shit.

728
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:08,218
A very popular strain
of the indica plant

729
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:09,586
is known as kush,

730
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,524
from the Hindu Kush Mountains
of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

731
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:17,527
Otherwise known as the shit
that got Bin Laden caught.

732
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,561
That's right.

733
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:20,096
Him and his boys
was in the mountains,

734
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,298
and they was shootin'
their guns, bustin' 'em off,

735
00:30:22,332 --> 00:30:24,935
came up on some
of that sweet kush plant.

736
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:27,137
Smoked it, didn't know
where the fuck he was,

737
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,105
had a Navy Seal bullet
in his head two hours later.

738
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:31,207
All right?

739
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:33,276
You smoke it,
but don't get shot.

740
00:30:34,277 --> 00:30:35,445
Light that end right there.

741
00:30:35,478 --> 00:30:37,347
Inhale.
Now take the top off.

742
00:30:38,614 --> 00:30:40,149
Oh, damn, boy.

743
00:30:40,182 --> 00:30:42,185
Damn, boy.

744
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:45,221
Now if you want less
of a body high,

745
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,823
Captain Kush recommends
one of the sativa strains,

746
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:51,193
like Green Crack,
Skunk, Train Wreck.

747
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,628
Yeah, that's right.

748
00:30:52,662 --> 00:30:54,630
It's more of a cerebral high.

749
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:57,700
It's less sedating,
but a good recommendation

750
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:00,469
if you want to feel medicated
throughout the day.

751
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:01,470
That's right.

752
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:03,072
Smoke all motherfuckin' day.

753
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:04,173
It's safe.

754
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:08,610
Four, three, two, one.

755
00:31:08,643 --> 00:31:10,212
Shoot it.

756
00:31:13,616 --> 00:31:15,350
Purple.

757
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:17,452
Kush.

758
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:19,821
Then you put 'em both together
and you make purple kush.

759
00:31:19,854 --> 00:31:22,524
Purple kush, together.

760
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:24,459
Yeah, there you go.

761
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:25,961
As you can see,
the Cannabis Indica

762
00:31:25,995 --> 00:31:29,564
is characterized
by short, blocky leaves.

763
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,065
Kinda like
a Mike Tyson build.

764
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,300
Whereas the Cannabis Sativa

765
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:35,270
is more long and narrow
like Tommy Hearns.

766
00:31:35,304 --> 00:31:36,271
Yeah, man.

767
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:37,472
Yes, Sir.

768
00:31:37,506 --> 00:31:40,942
We must take one big pull
from the check...

769
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,112
together.

770
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:45,479
Now I use boxing analogies...

771
00:31:45,513 --> 00:31:47,148
D-d-d-ding.

772
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:49,918
because both of them
will knock you the fuck out.

773
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,319
D-d-d-ding.

774
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:53,354
Rewind.

775
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:58,692
One more time.

776
00:31:59,994 --> 00:32:01,595
In Volume Two
of the Kushopedia,

777
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,631
we will be discussing
how to properly cultivate

778
00:32:03,664 --> 00:32:06,199
your green room
by supplying your plants

779
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:08,269
with all of the right nutrients.

780
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:09,770
That's right.

781
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,274
Mm, mm, mm.

782
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,476
Get high, motherfucker.

783
00:32:25,452 --> 00:32:26,686
I can't go to sleep yet,

784
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:30,190
I got this new James Bond
shit right here, right?

785
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:32,760
All you gotta do
is just inhale.

786
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:34,027
Hit that shit.

787
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:36,563
Don't do nothin'
but inhale.

788
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:38,030
Hit it.

789
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,802
Straight THC.

790
00:32:44,304 --> 00:32:45,505
Can you dig that?

791
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:47,640
Weed vaporization is
the alternative to smoking

792
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,175
that involves the production
of irritating,

793
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,311
toxic, and carcinogenic
byproducts

794
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,846
by heating the ganja
so its active compounds

795
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,915
boil off into a vapor.

796
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:58,084
Boil off into a vapor?

797
00:32:58,117 --> 00:32:59,919
Man, who the fuck
wrote this shit?

798
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:01,353
Fuck all that.

799
00:33:01,387 --> 00:33:02,589
Look, check it out.

800
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:04,390
There's only two ways
to smoke this shit.

801
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:06,058
The right way,
and the wrong way.

802
00:33:06,092 --> 00:33:08,427
And the right way is like
they say it in the Bible.

803
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,562
Roll that shit, light that shit,
smoke that shit.

804
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:12,765

They're gonna throw
that shit right on out.

1131

1132
00:49:21,176 --> 00:49:22,677
Yeah.

1133
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,448
So, which one of y'all I get
to fuck in the ass first?

1134
00:49:26,481 --> 00:49:27,815
Him.

1135
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,017
Y'all need
to make up your mind,

1136
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:32,219
'cause uh,
I got plenty of time.

1137
00:49:35,023 --> 00:49:36,524
Now D, man, now you need
to chill out, man.

1138
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:37,525
Calm down.

1139
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:39,026
Man, I am down.

1140
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,128
Like rock bottom down.

1141
00:49:41,162 --> 00:49:43,330
I gave my virginity
to a stripper,

1142
00:49:43,364 --> 00:49:45,267
got thrown in jail.

1143
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,068
Man, I ruined my life.

1144
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:52,673
Well, technically you gave your
virginity to Ashley's a-piece.

1145
00:49:55,008 --> 00:49:56,578
Yeah, I might not
have been cool before,

1146
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:58,580
but at least I had a future.

1147
00:49:58,613 --> 00:50:00,782
I ain't tryin'
to end up like you.

1148
00:50:00,815 --> 00:50:02,683
Fifteen years
of high school?

1149

You made bail.

So that's how it is?

1154
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:12,726
I guess it's like that.

a fine piece of pussy,

who agreed
to drop the charges.

Well, that's the best part.

He's gonna take the fall.

1173

He tried to ruin
your life, right?

1174
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,110
It's not like he tried
to force me to do anything.

By the way, somebody's
gonna get some if he's lucky.

Hey, you know I'm gonna
pay you back.

1184
00:51:30,402 --> 00:51:31,536
Why don't we go

Oh shit!

<i>And next up to present
their final project</i>

00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:45,308
are Devin and Mac.

1195
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:49,913
Actually, I'm going
to be doing this one solo.

1196
00:52:49,947 --> 00:52:52,682
Well I- I've been trying
to develop an alternative fuel

1197
00:52:52,715 --> 00:52:54,851
from a mix of all
natural substances,

1198
00:52:54,884 --> 00:52:57,153
but the mix
was highly volatile

1199
00:52:57,186 --> 00:53:00,557
<i>and we couldn't find a catalyst
to help stabilize the compound</i>

1200
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:02,059
and supercharge the fuel.

1201
00:53:02,092 --> 00:53:03,059
Uh, I'm sorry.

1202
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:06,395
What was this magical catalyst?

1203
00:53:06,428 --> 00:53:10,333
Delta-nine-tetrahydrocannabino.

1204
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:12,702
Isn't that the main
chemical in...

1205
00:53:12,735 --> 00:53:14,671
Marijuana, motherfucker.

1206
00:53:14,704 --> 00:53:16,505
Also known as THC.

<i>I cross-pollinated
genetically superior weed</i>

1209

<i>And you do know that.</i>

00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:46,802

No more gas-powered cars?

Can we do that?
Yes we can.

1223
00:54:07,488 --> 00:54:10,425
If we start now, we can build
the world's first weed-powered

Mr. Skinnfloot.

It's come to my attention
that one of your students

No, Mr. Johnson!

00:55:41,748 --> 00:55:42,916
Ah, no, that's bullshit.

1254
00:55:42,949 --> 00:55:44,350
An elegant defense.

1255
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,952
But I'm afraid you'll have
to prove your innocence

1256
00:55:46,985 --> 00:55:50,122
by taking a test administered
by yours truly.

1257
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:51,324
Mr. Skinnfloot,

1258
00:55:51,357 --> 00:55:53,559
are you really qualified
to do such a thing?

1259
00:55:53,592 --> 00:55:55,494
My number one love in life,

1260
00:55:55,528 --> 00:55:59,397
after the trimming
of beautiful bonsai trees,

1261
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:02,401
is the art of mathematics.

1262
00:56:05,604 --> 00:56:09,774
Simply solve this little
equation and you graduate.

1263
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,313
Why?

1264
00:56:15,347 --> 00:56:16,314
Why?

1265
00:56:16,348 --> 00:56:17,882
For the past fifteen years

1266
00:56:17,915 --> 00:56:20,685
you have made a mockery
of the very educational system

1267
00:56:20,718 --> 00:56:23,187
I've sworn to protect.

1268
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,157
And because you've
made my life hell

1269
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,425
with your marijuana
related hijinks.

1270
00:56:27,459 --> 00:56:31,729
But most of all,
the reason I'm doing this

1271
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:37,134
is so I can fill Miss Huck
with my man seed.

1272
00:56:40,471 --> 00:56:42,139
No.

1273
00:56:42,173 --> 00:56:44,375
Y is the answer.

1274
00:56:44,408 --> 00:56:46,811
Y.

1275
00:56:46,844 --> 00:56:48,179
Y...

1276
00:56:48,946 --> 00:56:51,382
is correct.

1277
00:56:51,415 --> 00:56:53,450
Now give me my diploma, bitch.

1278
00:56:53,484 --> 00:56:54,651
Can you believe it?

1279
00:56:54,685 --> 00:56:55,920
Mac is finally gonna graduate

of high school.

1281
00:56:58,389 --> 00:56:59,556
And you know what that mean.

1282
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,225
Miss Huck can finally get it.

1283
00:57:01,258 --> 00:57:02,926
Devin got his speech ready

1284
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:06,229
and he's still lettin' that same
punk-ass girlfriend hang around.

1285
00:57:06,262 --> 00:57:08,899
Well, I guess she was good
for something.

1286
00:57:08,932 --> 00:57:11,202
Because Yale is in the house.

1287
00:57:11,235 --> 00:57:13,504
Go on and do your Ivy League
thing, D-Street.

1288
00:57:13,537 --> 00:57:15,005
Wish more brothers could.

1289
00:57:15,038 --> 00:57:17,040
Shit, I wish more
brothers would.

1290
00:57:17,073 --> 00:57:19,910
Point is, we all gotta
move on at some point.

1291
00:57:19,943 --> 00:57:23,113
So, sit back
and enjoy the celebration.

1292
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:39,162
The scholarship guy from Yale
is here with my dad.

1293
00:57:39,195 --> 00:57:42,098
<i>They're excited
for your speech.</i>

1294
00:57:42,132 --> 00:57:44,300

1295

<i>we begin our commencement
with a speech</i>

1296

from our Valedictorian,
Devin Overstreet.

1297
00:57:58,814 --> 00:58:02,017
High school.

1298

It's the best of times,
it's the worst of times.

1300
00:58:12,795 --> 00:58:14,163
I vast in the moment.

1301
00:58:15,497 --> 00:58:17,166
<i>I wish I could do that.</i>

1302
00:58:17,899 --> 00:58:19,033
You can, homey.

1303
00:58:21,703 --> 00:58:25,840
Well actually, this is something
a friend of mine taught me.

1304
00:58:25,874 --> 00:58:27,509
And him, more than
anybody I know,

1305
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:29,478

Now it's time for
my valedictorian speech.

1344
01:00:26,858 --> 01:00:29,661
Y'all ready?

1345
01:00:29,695 --> 01:00:32,564
So many people in the world
still look down on marijuana.

1346
01:00:32,598 --> 01:00:34,133
What a shame.

1347
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:35,901
No matter what field you in,

1348
01:00:35,934 --> 01:00:39,170
be it creative,
blue or white collar,

1349
01:00:39,204 --> 01:00:40,671
there are a lot
of genius motherfuckers

1350
01:00:40,705 --> 01:00:42,474
that puff herb on the regular.

1351
01:00:42,508 --> 01:00:45,143
So does that make
your dumber, slower?

1352
01:00:45,176 --> 01:00:47,646
Hell fuckin' no.

1353
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:50,415
It opens up your mind
to new ideas.

1354
01:00:50,448 --> 01:00:52,016
Some cool song lyrics maybe,

1355
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:53,352
a new invention,

1356
01:00:53,385 --> 01:00:56,621
a simple trick to solving
a difficult math problem,

1357
01:00:56,654 --> 01:00:58,256
or something simple as,

1358
01:00:58,289 --> 01:01:00,691
hey, I bet it'd taste good
if I put some crunched up bacon

1359
01:01:00,725 --> 01:01:02,360
in that waffle batter.

1360
01:01:02,393 --> 01:01:05,296
Call marijuana a drug
all you want.

1361
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:07,232
Shun it all you want.

1362
01:01:07,265 --> 01:01:08,966
Be closed-minded.

1363
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,000
Think I care?

1364
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:11,636
I pity ya.

1365
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:15,506
We have a safe way to relax,
expand, grow our minds,

1366
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,908
and all from a beautiful
wonderful smelling plant

1367
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:19,477
that grows on this earth.

1368
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,812
Look how it connected
Mac and Devin.

1369
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:24,948
If it made two people as
different as that become homeys,

1370
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:28,719
shit, nigga, we can do
any motherfuckin' thing.

1371
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:30,287
And speakin' of Mac and Devin,

1372
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,923
ain't no tellin' what
they gonna get into next.

1373
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:36,225
And I for one,
sure can't wait to find out.

1374
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:39,696
So until next time, whenever
you feel pressured in life,

1375
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,865
and when you're goin'
through hard times

1376
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,233
and you need
a common denominator

1377
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:44,801
to mellow everything out,

1378
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:46,235
don't forget these words
of advice

1379

Slow Burn.

1380
