Mutants. Since the discovery
of their existence...

2
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,628
they have been
regarded with fear...

3
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,798
suspicion, often hatred.

4
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,134
Across the planet, debate rages.

5
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,637
Are mutants the next link
in the evolutionary chain...

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,140
or simply a new species
of humanity...

7
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,310
fighting for their share
of the world?

8
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,396
Either way,
it is an historical fact:

9
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,984
Sharing the world
has never been humanity's
defining attribute.

"Though passion

00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,619
it must not break the bonds
of our affection."

Lincoln said that
in his first inaugural address
as our nation's 16th president.

16
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,418
It's one of my favorites.

17

So, if you’ll please
have your tickets ready...

sure how to say this...

you've been—

You've been different.

I can hear everything.
It's not just your telepathy.

is about to happen.

My brother asked you
a simple question.
Why are you being such a dick?

89
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,150
Yeah, why are you
being such a dick?

I can't help it if your
girlfriend's getting excited.

she's getting excited.
- Trying to have a good time.

107
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,109
I didn't do this.

No.

108
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,528
I did.

where there's been
an attack in the Oval Office
of the White House.

00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,595
Details are still coming in,
but we have been informed...

that the president
and vice-president
were not harmed.

No. I don't
think so, Scott.

While Eric is capable
of organizing something
like this from prison...

121
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,334
for him
it would be irrational.

122
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,336
It would only hurt his goal
of mutant prosperity.

123
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,880
You mean superiority.
You're right.

124
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,634

- Of course, you know how
the government will respond.

125
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,886
They'll reintroduce
the Registration Act.

126
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:06,141
Or worse. The president could
declare a state of emergency.

127
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,727
Place every mutant
in the country under arrest.

was working alone?

Well, we'll only know that
if we find him before
the authorities do.

I've been trying to
track him using Cerebro...

131
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:21,239
but his movements
are inexplicably erratic.

more exact coordinates...

133

I'll need you to take the jet
and try and pick him up.

Closer than anyone's admitted.

136
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,089
What do you need,

Just your authorization...

you were here to talk
about school reform.

Mr. President.

- His department has been dealing
with the mutant phenomenon...

00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,281
since before my time.

145
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,534
As I recall,
you were a staunch supporter of
the Registration Act, Senator.

146
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,871
It seems your ideas
on the mutant problem
have changed recently.

147
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,123
For the best,
I hope.

00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,126
So, what are you proposing,
Mr. Stryker?

get this information?

155
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,320
Interrogation of one of
the mutant terrorists...

156
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,447
from the Liberty Island
incident.

157
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,908
Eric? Eric Lehnsherr?

158
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,161
You have access to him?
[Stryker]
Magneto. Yes.

159
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,414
We developed the technology
that built his plastic prison.

160
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:01,297
- This facility is a school.
- Sure it is.

161
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,262
What the hell is that?
Ajet.

162
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,473
- What kind of jet?
- We don't know...

163
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:15,144
but it comes up
out of the basketball court.

164

[Stryker]
If we’d been allowed to do our jobs,
Mr. President, before this incident—

165
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,948
All right. Listen.

166
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,246
William, you enter,
you detain, you question...

167
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,582
but the last thing
we need to see...

168
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,585
is the body of a mutant kid
on the 6:00 news.

169
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,304
Mr. Stryker.
Senator Kelly.

This is Yuriko,
my personal assistant.

171
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,603
Quite a handshake.
What can
I do for you?

172
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,440
Uh, Eric Lehnsherr's prison.
I'd like to arrange a visit
if possible.

173
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,567
It isn't a petting zoo,
Senator.

174
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,569
In this conflict,
he is the enemy.

175
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,906
You're just a spectator.
So why don't you sit
this one out, all right?

176
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,410
Conflict? Mr. Stryker,
do you really want to turn this
into some kind of war?

177
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,418
I was piloting black-ops
missions in the jungles
of North Vietnam...

on your mama's tit
at Woodstock, Kelly.

Don't lecture me
about war.

180
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,009

You miss me, kid?

Not really.
Mm. How you doing?

191
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,063
I'm okay.
How are you?
Who's this?

192
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,400
Oh, this is Bobby.
He's my—
I'm her boyfriend.

Well, we're still
working on that.

Look who's come back.
Just in time.

198

For what?
We need a baby-sitter.

Baby-sitter?
Nice to see you again,

- Hi, Jean.

Uh, I should go
and get the jet ready.

Yeah, well,
it was good to meet you.

We won't be gone long.

00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,452
The professor wants us
to track down a mutant
who attacked the president.

00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,454
So it was a mutant?

looking for, Logan?

Aren't you gonna
welcome me home?

218

Mr. Lehnsherr...

I'd like to have one final talk...

00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,284
about the house
that Xavier built...

and the machine
called Cerebro.

Logan, my tolerance for your smoking
in the mansion notwithstanding...

00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:40,386
continue smoking that in here
and you'll spend the rest of your days...

concentrate harder?

Oh, my God.
There's two of 'em.

791
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:02,327
There's one more.

792
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,995
Jean—

793
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,290
[Gasps]
Oh, God!

794
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,259

- No!
- [Alarm Blaring]

796
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:04,389
- Jean?
- It's not me.

797

01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,446
When will these people

[Chuckles]

01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:41,551
Thank you.
Bitte schön.

801
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:52,478
- Can you hear
what they're saying?
- I could take a closer look.

802
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,607
His name is
Colonel William Stryker...

803
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,276
and he invaded your mansion
for one purpose:

804
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,905
He wanted Cerebro.

805
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,532
Or enough of it
to build one of his own.

806
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:09,913
But that doesn't make any sense.
Stryker would need the professor to operate it.

807
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,874
Which I think is the only reason
my old friend is still alive.

808
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:15,752
Oh, my God.

809
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:18,546
Now, what are you all so afraid of?

810
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,965
While Cerebro is working,
Charles' mind is connected...

811
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,218
to every living person
on the planet.

812
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,970
If he were forced to
concentrate hard enough
on a particular group—

813
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,015
let's say, mutants,
for example—

814
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:32,477
- he could kill us all.
- Wait a minute.

815
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,272
How would Stryker even know
where to find Cerebro
in the first place?

816
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,569
Because I told him.

817
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:46,032
I helped Charles build it,
remember?

818
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:50,411
Mr. Stryker has
powerful methods
of persuasion.

819
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,956
Even against a mutant
as strong as Charles.

820
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:57,877
So who's this
Stryker anyway?
He's a military scientist.

821
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:02,006
He spent his whole life
trying to solve
the mutant problem.

822
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:06,844
If you want
a more intimate perspective,
why don't you ask Wolverine?

823
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:10,556
You don't remember,
do you?

824
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:14,769
William Stryker, the only
other man I know who can
manipulate adamantium.

825
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:19,357
The metal on your bones.
It carries his signature.

826
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:23,361
- But the professor-
- The professor trusted...

827
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:27,031
you were smart enough to
discover this on your own.

828
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,867
He gives you more credit
than I do.

829
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:34,747
- Why do you need us?
- Mystique has discovered plans
of a base...

830
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:38,126
that Stryker's been
operating out off or decades.

831
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,461
We know that's where
he's building the second Cerebro...

832
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:44,173
but we don't know
where this base is...

833
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,676
and I believe
one of you might.

834
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:52,432
- The professor already tried.
- Once again, you think
it's all about you.

835
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,187
Oh... hello.

836
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:07,613
I didn't mean to snoop.
Just try and relax.

01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,381
[Gasps]
I'm sorry.

838
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:31,220
Stryker's at Alkali Lake.

839
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:34,349
[Logan]
That's where the professor
sent me. There's nothing left.

840
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:39,395
There's nothing left
on the surface, Logan.
The base is underground.

841
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:53,659

You okay?

844
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,835
Yeah.
You sure?

845
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:07,215
How we doing?
Not good.

846
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:10,093
It'll take four or five hours before
I can get it off the ground.

847
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:13,304
That's not what I meant.

848
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:17,767
I'm just worried
about Scott.
I'm worried about you.

849
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:20,812
That was some display
of power up there.

850
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:25,274
Obviously, it wasn't enough.
Hey, hey.

I love him.

the dangerous guy, Logan...

they don't take him home.

They marry the good guy.

856
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,335
I could be the good guy.

857

sticks around.

Excuse me.

[Imitating Night crawler]
Even their voice.

Then why not
stay in disguise

You know,

we shouldn't have to.

quite like you.

But what do you want?

What do you really want?

Is that what

Quite a talent
you have there, Pyro.

When I build a machine,
I wanna make sure that
it's working.

All right, this is
a topographic map
of the dam.

This is the spillway.

You see these
density changes
in the terrain?

902
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,333
They're tire tracks.
That's the entrance.

Mm-hmm. And this
shows the depth of the ice
that's covering the ground.

Now, this is recent

Can you teleport inside?

No. I have to be able

otherwise I could
wind up inside a wall.

I'll go. I have a hunch
he'll want me alive.

the dam needs to be able to
operate the spillway mechanism.

01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:07,958
A large portion of energy
from the dam has been diverted
to this chamber.

945
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:09,626
[Storm] Cerebro.
[Magneto]
There it is.

946
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,963
Can you shut it down
from here?
No.

947
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:15,299
Come. There's
little time.
Not without us.

948
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:22,264
Oh, my God.
The children.

949
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:24,433
- Kurt, will you come with me?
- Yes.

950
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:27,978
[Storm] Where are they?
[Mystique] They're being held
in a containment cell one level down.

951
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,482
Stryker.
All right...

952
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,442
we'll get the children
and meet you at Cerebro.

953
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:37,738
[Jean]
Okay. I'll try to find Scott
and the professor.

954
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:41,909
- Will you be all right without us?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

955
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:44,328
Where's Logan?

956
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:52,503
He's gone.

957
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:56,548
You, set up a perimeter.
[Man] Move, move.

Jason.

959
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,057
It's time.

960
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:54,439
Time to
find our friends.

961
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:02,906
Is it time to
find our friends?

962
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:06,201
- All of them.
- All of them?

963
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:08,912
- All of the mutants.
- All the mutants?

964
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:13,292
- Everywhere.
- Everywhere?

965
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:16,170
That's right.
[Girl]
Every one of them?

966
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:18,630
Oh, yes.
[Girl]
Good.

967
01:26:19,632 --> 01:26:23,594
It's time to
bring it to an end.

968
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,931
Make me proud.

969
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:59,296
Just don't move.

970
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:05,510
Kill anyone
who approaches...
even if it's me.

971
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:33,872
Go! I'll take care of him!

Help! Get us out of here.

- Storm.

978
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,944
Get us out of here!
Okay, we're coming.

Jean, no, no, no.
It's okay.

983
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:37,329
It's okay. It's me.

984
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:39,748
Scott.
I'm so sorry.

985
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:44,086
I thought I'd lost you.
Oh, God.

986
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:49,174
I'm so sorry. I could see you,
but I couldn't stop myself.

987
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,218
I tried.
I'm sorry.
I love you so much.

Have you found the mutants yet?
Have you found all of them?

994
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:27,504
[Xavier] I'm trying.
There are so many of them.

995
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:30,298

The tricky thing about
adamantium is...

1003
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:43,139
that if you ever
manage to process...

1004
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:48,436
its raw, liquid form,
you gotta keep it that way.

1005
01:32:49,438 --> 01:32:53,567
Keep it hot.

1006
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:56,861
Because once the metal cools,
it's indestructible.

1007
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,866
But you already
know that.

1008
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:05,996
I used to think you were
one of a kind, Wolverine.

1009
01:33:10,793 --> 01:33:13,169

He's a teleporter.

No. Don't move.

this is a moment.

02:02:24,253 --> 02:02:26,171
You know...

1254
02:02:26,255 --> 02:02:28,840
even when Jean
was a student...

1255
02:02:28,924 --> 02:02:32,010
she was always hesitant
about her powers.

1256
02:02:32,094 --> 02:02:36,890
Always looking to others.

1257
02:02:36,974 --> 02:02:41,936
Feeling that in some way
she was left behind.

1258
02:02:45,858 --> 02:02:47,776
Do you think—

1259
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:51,654
Could we have done
more to save her?

1260
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:57,118
In the past, she may have let us.

1261
02:02:57,203 --> 02:03:00,789
There had to be another way.

1262
02:03:00,873 --> 02:03:03,375
Why did she leave the plane?

1263
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:09,547
Because she made a choice.

1264
02:03:09,632 --> 02:03:13,551
- [Knocking]
- [Xavier]
Yes, come on in.

1265
02:03:25,106 --> 02:03:27,315
Hey, hey.

1266
02:03:29,276 --> 02:03:32,821
Listen, she did make a choice.

1267
02:03:35,282 --> 02:03:37,283
It was you.

1268
02:04:10,025 --> 02:04:12,527
[Girl]
Professor?

1269
02:04:12,611 --> 02:04:14,654
Is everything all right?

1270
02:04:17,408 --> 02:04:20,618
Yes, I think it will be.

1271
02:04:20,703 --> 02:04:23,663
Now, tell me, have any
of you read a book...

1272
02:04:23,747 --> 02:04:27,375
by an English novelist
named T.H. White...

1273
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:30,753
called The Once and Future King?

1274
02:04:30,838 --> 02:04:33,423
No? Well—

1275
02:04:33,507 --> 02:04:35,675
[Continues, Indistinct]

1276
02:04:38,846 --> 02:04:40,388
[Jean's Voice]
Mutation.

1277
02:04:40,473 --> 02:04:42,724
It is the key
to our evolution.

1278
02:04:42,808 --> 02:04:45,810
It is how we have evolved from
a single-celled organism...

1279
02:04:45,895 --> 02:04:48,938
into the dominant species
on the planet.

1280
02:04:49,023 --> 02:04:50,857
This process is slow...

1281
02:04:50,941 --> 02:04:54,652
normally taking thousands
and thousands of years.

1282
02:04:54,737 --> 02:04:57,697
But every
few hundred millennia...

1283
02:04:57,781 --> 02:05:00,445
evolution leaps forward.
