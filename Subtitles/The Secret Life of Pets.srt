Oh! You're so sweet.

There's also a salty,

Yeah, that's me. (CHUCKLES)

I said "friend."

00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,000
but you're okay.

1317
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,128
Right back at you, man.

1318
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,240
When I met you, I was all like,

1319
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,846
"I don't know if I like him."

1320
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,162
But now that I know you, I'm like,

1321
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,169
"I like him." (LAUGHS)

1322
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,844
You know, I saw this
place from the outside

1323
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,365
many times.

1324
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,565
Had I known what treasures
awaited within these walls,

1325
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,440
I would've broke down that door

1326
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,363
a long time ago, I'll tell you!

1327
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,530
What are you talking about?

1328
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,001
My old owner and I
used to live around here.

1329
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,600
Duke, man, wait.

1330
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,250
Did you used to have an owner?

1331
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,364
Well, it was a long time ago.

1332
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,851
I don't want to talk about it.

1333
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,689
Yes, you do. Come on.

1334
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,124
DUKE: I don't know.

1335
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,886
But you know what?

1336
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,962
He was so cool.

1337
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,320
Yeah?

1338
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,126
Yeah.

1339
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,123
He was the best.

Man, we had fun.

1342
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,085
- We'd play fetch.
- (BARKS)

1343
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,084
We'd go for walks.

1344
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,844
We'd take naps.

1345
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,489
We were both big nappers.

1346
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,286
I got out one night,
chasing a butterfly, or a car.

1347
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,807
By the time I had caught up
with it and ate it...

1348
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,450
Probably a butterfly, then.

1349
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,365
...I realized I was so
far away from my home

1350
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,284
I couldn't find it.

1351
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,889
A few days later, I was picked up
by Animal Control.

1352
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,322
(SIGHING) I had a great thing going.

1353
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,803
But I had to go and mess it up.

1354
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,169
Duke, we gotta go to your house.

1355

Nah.

1356
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,882
Your owner's gonna be relieved!

1357
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,087
Will he?

1358
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,200
Yeah, but...

1359
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,328
But he never came for me.

1360
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,650
Maybe he...

1361
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,403
Maybe he didn't like me.

1362
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,364
Of course he liked you. He was your owner.

1363
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,761
I mean, he's probably worried sick!

1364
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,325
I don't know.

1365

Well, I do know and we're going!

That rabbit...

with that thing!

Gidget, here's an idea.

1380
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,685
Maybe there's a dog in the neighborhood
that looks like Max.

1381
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,683
Start hanging out with him.

1382

After a while, you'll think it's him
