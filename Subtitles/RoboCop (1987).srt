1
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:31,770
This is MediaBreak. You give us three
minutes and we'll give you the world.

2
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:35,024
Good morning. I'm Casey Wong.
with Jesse Perkins.

3
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,984
Top story: Pretoria.

4
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:40,905
The threat of nuclear confrontation
in South Africa escalated today

5
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,742
when the ruling white military
government of that city state

6
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:47,119
unveiled a French-made neutron bomb

7
00:00:47,244 --> 00:00:52,911
and affirmed its willingness to use the
device as the city's last line of defence.

8
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:58,297
The president's first press conference
from the Star Wars Peace Platform

9
00:00:58,422 --> 00:01:01,383
got off to a shaky start when power failed.

10
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:06,764
causing a brief period of weightlessness
for the visiting president and his staff.

11
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:08,974
We'll be back in a moment.

12
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:11,936
Is it time for that big operation?

13
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:15,356
This may be the most important
decision of your life.

14
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:19,235
So come down. and talk to
one of our qualified surgeons.

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,403
here at the Family Heart Center.

16
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:23,572
We feature the complete Jarvik line.

17
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:27,159
Series Seven Sports Heart by Jensen.
Yamaha.

18
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:28,744
You pick the heart.

19
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:31,247
Extended warranties. Financing.

20
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:33,457
Qualifies for health-tax credit.

21
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:38,212
And remember: we care.

22
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:42,216
Three dead police officers.
one critically injured.

23
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:45,845
Police union leaders blame
Omni Consumer Products. OCP.

24
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,014
a firm which has entered
into a contract with the city

25
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,893
to fund and run the Detroit
Metropolitan Police Department.

26
00:01:53,018 --> 00:01:55,396
Dick Jones. division president. OCP.

27
00:01:55,521 --> 00:02:00,109
Every policeman knows there are
certain risks that come with the territory.

28
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:03,863
Any cop'll tell you: "If you can't stand
the heat. stay out of the kitchen. "

29
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:07,825
Although seriously wounded.
Officer Frank Frederickson escaped

30
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,994
and identified this man.

31
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,706
Clarence Boddicker. unofficial
crime boss of Old Detroit.

32
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:17,293
now sought in connection with
the deaths of 31 police officers.

33
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:21,088
Today he's at large. while doctors
at Henry Ford Memorial Hospital

34
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:25,676
fight to save the life of Officer
Frank Frederickson. Good luck. Frank.

35
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:33,976
DETROIT
POLICE PRECINCT, METRO WEST

36
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:38,564
Attempted murder?
It's not like he killed someone.

37
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:41,192
This is a violation
of my client's civil rights.

38
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:44,737
Make it "aggravated assault"
and I can make bail, in cash, now.

39
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:48,657
Listen, pal. Your client's a scumbag.
You are a scumbag.

40
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:51,076
Scumbags see the judge
on Monday morning.

41
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:55,206
Now get out of my police station
and take laughing boy with you!

42
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:04,507
Hi.

43
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:07,927
Murphy, transferring in from Metro South.

44
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:11,680
- Nice precinct.
- Yeah, pretty good.

45
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:17,228
We work for a living down here, Murphy.
Get your armour and suit up.

46
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:25,820
Not now. Get a cup of coffee.

47
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:29,907
- Stark, any word on Frederickson?
- They're still listing him as critical.

48
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:32,201
His wife must be going out of her mind.

49
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:34,870
- Murphy, huh?
- Yeah, that's me. Hi.

50
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:37,373
- What brings you to this paradise?
- Beats me.

51
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:39,667
I think OCP's moving
a lot of new guys here.

52
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:41,919
Omni Consumer Products.

53
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:44,088
What a bunch of morons.

54
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:48,634
They're gonna manage
this department right into the ground.

55
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,636
- Where are you from?
- Metro South.

56
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:51,804
Welcome to hell.

57
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:55,099
Murphy! They cut ten guys loose
over on the East Side.

58
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:57,768
You try to get back up
when you're in a jam.

59
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:00,688
Yeah, try to get a medevac
after you've been jammed.

60
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:04,942
I'll tell you what we should do.
We should strike. Fuck 'em.

61
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,874
The funeral's tomorrow.

62
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:24,753
The department requests
all officers not on duty to attend.

63
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,091
Any donations for the family
may be given to Cecil, as usual.

64
00:04:32,344 --> 00:04:35,014
I don't wanna hear
any more talk about strike.

65
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:38,893
We're not plumbers.
We're police officers.

66
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,854
And police officers don't strike.

67
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:48,068
Murphy, front and centre.

68
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:08,047
Hello, tiger.

69
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:29,819
Lewis! Come here when you've finished
fuckin' around with your suspect.

70
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:36,492
This guy's gonna be your new partner.

71
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:39,161
Murphy, meet Lewis.
Show him the neighbourhood.

72
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,748
- Glad to know you, Murphy.
- Pretty neat.

73
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:48,420
I better drive until you know
your way around.

74
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:52,925
I usually drive when I'm
breaking in a new partner.

75
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:18,075
Do you really think the Old Man is gonna
be there? Why would they invite us?

76
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,413
All division heads are bringing
their support teams. It's big.

77
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:24,665
They must be green-lighting Delta City.

78
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,626
Are you kidding?
They never work ahead of schedule.

79
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:31,547
It's Jones. He's got the 209 series
on line and now he wants to show off.

80
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:34,133
- That's a tough break, Bob.
- What? What?

81
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:38,429
When ED-209 ran into serious delays
and cost overruns,

82
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:41,223
the Old Man ordered a backup plan.

83
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:45,478
Probably just to light a fire
under Jones's ass.

84
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:48,147
- Old Bob here gets the assignment.
- Yeah.

85
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:51,901
Nobody in Security Concepts
takes it seriously.

86
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:55,279
It's a better plan. Fuckin' Jones.
I'd go to the Old Man if I could.

87
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:57,948
Don't mess with Jones.
He'll make sushi out of you.

88
00:06:58,073 --> 00:07:02,536
- Be careful. I hear Jones is a real shark.
- Who asked you, twerp?

89
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:04,705
What about this police thing?

90
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,959
Their union's been bitching since
we took over. The usual nonsense.

91
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:11,128
We'll turn things around.

92
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:13,923
Good. Very good. Let's get started.

93
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:22,515
My friends,

94
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,018
I've had this dream...

95
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:28,771
for more than a decade now.

96
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:32,358
A dream which I've invited
you all to share with me.

97
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:37,613
In six months we begin construction...

98
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:39,782
of Delta City,

99
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:42,535
where Old Detroit now stands.

100
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:48,207
Old Detroit has a cancer.

101
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,919
The cancer is crime,
and it must be cut out

102
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:56,090
before we employ the two million
workers that will revive this city.

103
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:58,300
Yes.

104
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:06,809
Shifts in the tax structure have created
an economy ideal for corporate growth.

105
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:12,398
But community services, in this case,
law enforcement, have suffered.

106
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:17,695
I think it's time we gave something back.

107
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:21,532
Dick.

108
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:35,087
Take a close look at
the track record of this company.

109
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:37,840
You'll see that we have
gambled in markets

110
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:40,759
traditionally regarded as nonprofit.

111
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:46,015
Hospitals, prisons, space exploration.

112
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,351
I say good business is where you find it.

113
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:56,734
As you know, we have a contract with
the city to run local law enforcement.

114
00:08:57,902 --> 00:09:01,739
But at Security Concepts,
we believe an efficient police force

115
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:04,033
is only part of the solution.

116
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:07,244
No. We need something more.

117
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:10,581
We need a 24-hour-a-day police officer.

118
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:13,751
A cop who doesn't need to eat or sleep.

119
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:18,005
A cop with superior firepower,
and the reflexes to use it.

120
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:21,842
Fellow executives,

121
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:27,181
it gives me great pleasure to introduce
you to the future of law enforcement.

122
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:32,394
ED-209.

123
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:11,058
The Enforcement Droid, series 209,

124
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:13,978
is a self-sufficient
law-enforcement robot.

125
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:19,108
209 is programmed for urban pacification,
but that is only the beginning.

126
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:21,902
After a successful
tour of duty in Old Detroit,

127
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:26,824
we can expect 209 to become the hot
military product for the next decade.

128
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:30,119
- Dr McNamara.
- We'll need an arrest subject.

129
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:33,873
- Mr Kinney, would you give us a hand?
- Yes, sir.

130
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:38,919
Mr Kinney is going to help us simulate
a typical arrest and disarming procedure.

131
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:42,298
Mr Kinney, use your gun
in a threatening manner.

132
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,552
- Point it at ED-209.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:57,271
Please put down your weapon.

134
00:10:57,396 --> 00:10:59,940
You have 20 seconds to comply.

135
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,528
I think you'd better do
what he says, Mr Kinney.

136
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:12,786
You now have 15 seconds to comply.

137
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:18,250
You are in direct violation
of Penal Code 113, section nine.

138
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:21,504
You now have five seconds to comply.

139
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,464
Four, three,

140
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:25,633
two, one.

141
00:11:25,758 --> 00:11:29,011
I am now authorised
to use physical force.

142
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:58,861
Somebody wanna call a goddamn
paramedic? Let's go, Johnson.

143
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,196
Did you pull the plug on this thing?

144
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:05,826
Don't touch him. Don't touch him!

145
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:09,246
- He didn't hear the gun drop.
- He didn't hear it?

146
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:14,001
Dick, I'm very disappointed.

147
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:18,505
I'm sure it's only a glitch.
A temporary setback.

148
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,883
You call this a glitch?

149
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:24,303
We begin construction in six months.

150
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:28,349
Your "setback" could cost us
$50 million in interest payments alone.

151
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:31,769
Not necessarily. Perhaps you know
of the RoboCop programme,

152
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:36,023
developed by myself at Security Concepts
as a contingency against this?

153
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:39,985
- Thank you, Mr Morton. I'm sure this...
- Now wait a minute.

154
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,154
Dick!

155
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:46,992
Maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective.

156
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:49,995
Tell me about your plan.
How long will it take?

157
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,958
We're ready to go. We've restructured the
police department with prime candidates.

158
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:57,670
I'm confident we can go
to prototype within 90 days.

159
00:12:57,795 --> 00:13:03,509
Good. Get your staff together. I'll
expect a full presentation in 20 minutes.

160
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:05,678
Thank you, sir.

161
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:16,021
Yes! That's how it's done in the big
leagues. You see an opening and go for it.

162
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:20,192
Watch your back, Bob.
Jones is gonna come looking for you.

163
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:23,987
Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball
and I was there to pick it up.

164
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:27,199
Too bad about Kinney, huh?

165
00:13:27,324 --> 00:13:29,368
That's life in the big city.

166
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:35,290
- When do we start?
- As soon as some schmuck volunteers.

167
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,767
Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.

168
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:57,771
Yeah, well, my son Jimmy
watches this cop show, TJ Lazer.

169
00:13:57,896 --> 00:14:03,068
This Lazer does this when he takes down
a bad guy. So my kid thinks a good cop...

170
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:05,738
And you don't wanna disappoint him.

171
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:09,533
Yeah, well, role models can
be very important to a boy.

172
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:18,625
OK, OK, I get a kick out of it.

173
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:20,794
All units. All units. Sector nine.

174
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,880
Well, that's...

175
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,632
Why don't you drive?

176
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:29,470
Suspects are armed
and considered dangerous.

177
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:33,515
Shit!

178
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:38,896
I don't believe it!
You burnt the fuckin' money!

179
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:41,106
I had to blow the door!
What do you want?

180
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:45,527
It's as good as marked, you asshole!
You stupid, stupid asshole!

181
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:48,322
- Clarence!
- What do you want?

182
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,491
We got a cop on our tail.

183
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:59,416
- Come on, man. Speed it up.
- Move it!

184
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,461
- Hey, this crate won't outrun a cop's!
- Slow down, then.

185
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:06,924
- Are you crazy, man?
- Shut the fuck up and do it! Just do it!

186
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:11,553
Central, this is 154. We are in pursuit
of suspect. Request backup.

187
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,222
Roger. 154.

188
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:16,266
- Backup currently unavailable.
- Give me your piece.

189
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:18,727
Backup ETA. 15 minutes.

190
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:23,232
- Bobby, get the door. Everybody load up.
- All right, let's go. Come on!

191
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,984
- OK.
- All right, here we go.

192
00:15:31,323 --> 00:15:32,741
Now!

193
00:15:35,786 --> 00:15:39,081
- What the fuck? Where did he go?
- Emil!

194
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:41,667
Here! He's up here!

195
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,974
Get 'em!

196
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:08,527
- Shit, Clarence. My leg.
- Leon, pick him up.

197
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:10,946
- Ready?
- No. Hang on.

198
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,115
Bobby.

199
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:16,702
- Can you fly, Bobby?
- Clarence, no.

200
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:18,871
Hit it!

201
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,207
No!

202
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:47,399
This is unit 154. We located that van
by the Old Mill in sector 3D.

203
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:50,361
- Where's that backup?
- Still unavailable.

204
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:53,364
- Oh, man!
- 20 minutes before units can arrive.

205
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,660
Well, you call it.

206
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:00,537
- Let's do it.
- OK.

207
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:09,254
Go.

208
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,423
Stay in touch.

209
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:55,342
Freeze.

210
00:17:56,885 --> 00:18:01,015
OK, let's see those hands. Nice and easy.

211
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:04,309
Sure. Mind if I...

212
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,104
zip this up?

213
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:30,002
- We rob banks but never keep the money.
- Takes money to make money.

214
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:33,630
We steal money to buy coke, then sell
the coke to make even more money.

215
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:37,593
- Capital investment.
- Why bother making it? Let's just steal it.

216
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:40,137
Best way to steal money
is free enterprise.

217
00:18:40,262 --> 00:18:43,265
- Smoke?
- No. You know, those things'll kill ya.

218
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,225
Yeah.

219
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:47,853
Do you wanna live for ever?

220
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,618
Hey. Don't move.

221
00:19:06,664 --> 00:19:08,499
Go ahead and do it.

222
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,752
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

223
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,261
Lewis? Lewis!

224
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:24,557
Lewis, I got a situation here.

225
00:19:24,682 --> 00:19:29,687
OK, tough guy, get up. Turn around.
Spread your legs. That's right.

226
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:33,482
Lewis. where are you? You all right?

227
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,819
Put your hands on your head.

228
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:38,529
Lewis?

229
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:45,786
Why don't you let us
take over from here, Emil?

230
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:06,182
- Your ass is mine.
- No.

231
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,643
Not yet it ain't.

232
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:23,199
Well, what have we here?

233
00:20:25,743 --> 00:20:28,204
You a good cop, hotshot?

234
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:32,500
Sure you are.

235
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,878
Why, you gotta be some kinda great cop.

236
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:38,047
Come in here all by yourself.

237
00:20:42,968 --> 00:20:45,846
Where's your partner?
Where's your partner?

238
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:48,974
Well, guys. The other one was upstairs.

239
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,018
She was sweet.

240
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:55,397
I took her out.

241
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:01,362
I bet that really pisses you off.

242
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:11,414
You probably don't think
I'm a very nice guy. Do you?

243
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,792
Buddy, I think you're slime.

244
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:20,464
See, I got this problem.

245
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:23,384
Cops don't like me.

246
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:25,845
So I don't like cops.

247
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,822
Well, give the man a hand.

248
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:49,368
He's all yours.

249
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:05,633
- All right, look out.
- Turn around, man.

250
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:08,427
Hey, brave boy! Hey, over here!

251
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:32,155
- I'm outta ammo.
- Me too.

252
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,356
Hey, Clarence, he's still alive.

253
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:43,200
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

254
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:52,042
OK. Fun's over.

255
00:22:57,405 --> 00:22:59,323
OK, let's get outta here.

256
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:03,536
Good night, sweet prince.

257
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,747
Hey, wait up, wait up, wait up.

258
00:23:30,187 --> 00:23:31,814
Murphy.

259
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:55,697
Let's get him over here.

260
00:23:57,407 --> 00:24:00,535
- The ventilator. Get the mask.
- Get him into OR4.

261
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:07,876
Easy, easy.

262
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:12,172
Slow down now. Slow down.

263
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:14,174
OK, get the door.

264
00:24:18,428 --> 00:24:20,889
- Let me get pressure.
- Good. Mask him.

265
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:24,142
Got a pressure of 60 Pel.

266
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:26,770
We're gonna have to intubate this guy.

267
00:24:30,023 --> 00:24:32,901
OK. We got it in. Breath sounds?

268
00:24:33,777 --> 00:24:35,653
- You're in.
- Other side.

269
00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:40,742
- OK. Let's get the MAST trousers out.
- Get the clothes off.

270
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:45,038
Prep him for a central line.
Let's get some blood drawn.

271
00:24:45,163 --> 00:24:47,165
Type and crossing, six units.

272
00:24:51,461 --> 00:24:53,505
- His pressure's dropping.
- OK.

273
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,800
I've got a central line in.
Get the pressure back.

274
00:24:56,925 --> 00:24:58,843
Can you do that, Dad?

275
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,890
I really have to tell you something.

276
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:07,102
I've got 40 Pel.

277
00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:14,818
- Michelle, we're flat here.
- V-fib.

278
00:25:14,943 --> 00:25:16,986
OK, we gotta shock him.

279
00:25:21,574 --> 00:25:24,369
Let's go ahead and
blow up the MAST trousers.

280
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:26,246
Stand clear.

281
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:31,918
Coarse V-fib. Let's shock him again.

282
00:25:32,043 --> 00:25:33,628
Clear.

283
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:38,466
- Flatline.
- Let's go. Intracardiac epinephrine.

284
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:41,720
- Let's go.
- OK.

285
00:25:43,513 --> 00:25:46,266
- All right, it's in.
- There's no pulse.

286
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:49,436
All right. Let's shock
the flatline, then let's quit.

287
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,813
Everybody, clear!

288
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:03,867
All right, I think that's all we can do.
Let's call it. What's the time?

289
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:24,471
- It's sharp.
- Yeah, it's startin' to roll.

290
00:26:26,973 --> 00:26:28,391
Ah... shit!

291
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:36,816
Bring in the LED.

292
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:38,985
Lock it down.

293
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,619
- He's on.
- What's the story?

294
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:49,496
We were able to save the left arm.

295
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:53,917
What? I thought we agreed on total
body prosthesis. Lose the arm, OK?

296
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:56,086
Jesus, Morton.

297
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,840
- Can he understand me?
- Doesn't matter. We'll blank his memory.

298
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:03,551
I think we should lose the arm.
What do you think?

299
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:07,263
He signed release forms when
he joined the force. He's legally dead.

300
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:09,683
We can do pretty much what we want to.

301
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,894
Lose the arm.

302
00:27:13,395 --> 00:27:15,689
Shut him down. Prep him for surgery.

303
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:22,404
The entire outer skin will be like this.

304
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:24,781
It's titanium, laminated with Kevlar.

305
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:26,950
Go ahead. Shake his hand.

306
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:30,829
Do you come here often?

307
00:27:32,414 --> 00:27:36,835
Ow! God! He's got a helluva grip.

308
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,964
It's 400 foot-pounds.
He could crush every bone in your hand.

309
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:43,717
All right, attach it to his shoulder.

310
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:45,885
I like that.

311
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:53,476
You are gonna be a bad motherfucker.

312
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,237
Hey, look! Look! He's watching us!

313
00:28:04,362 --> 00:28:06,740
Hi! Happy New Year.

314
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:11,995
This is for you.

315
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:16,624
Happy New Year.

316
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:26,259
We get the best of both worlds. The
fastest reflexes technology has to offer.

317
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:28,136
Computer-assisted memory.

318
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:31,514
A lifetime of on-the-street
law-enforcement programming.

319
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:34,601
It is my great pleasure to present to you...

320
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:38,730
RoboCop.

321
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:43,985
Come on, come on.

322
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,779
It's for you.

323
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:47,947
Go, Robo.

324
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:07,926
I'm what you call a repeat offender.

325
00:29:08,051 --> 00:29:12,847
I repeat, I will offend again.
I get my orders from a higher source.

326
00:29:12,972 --> 00:29:15,016
Shut up, asshole.

327
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:22,774
- Bring him in through the side door.
- A cell has been set up for us.

328
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,193
- What's goin' on here?
- Who is this guy?

329
00:29:25,318 --> 00:29:27,278
- Sergeant Reed.
- What's this about?

330
00:29:27,404 --> 00:29:31,116
It's about official OCP business.
So please, get lost.

331
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:34,619
- We've got four or five days...
- This is bullshit!

332
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:36,996
I take my orders from...

333
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,473
What is this shit?

334
00:30:16,327 --> 00:30:18,663
When you are at rest,
you will sit in the chair.

335
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:20,707
Yes, I understand.

336
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:25,170
- What about tracking?
- We check his location with one of these.

337
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:30,175
- How does he eat?
- His digestive system is very simple.

338
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,804
This processor dispenses a rudimentary
paste that sustains his organic systems.

339
00:30:42,937 --> 00:30:44,981
Tastes like baby food.

340
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:48,485
Knock yourself out.

341
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:01,623
- OK, let's start with tracking.
- Give me a grid.

342
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:04,626
Target.

343
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,294
Target.

344
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:08,463
Now follow.

345
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:17,389
Voice-stress analyser.
One, two, three.

346
00:31:18,473 --> 00:31:20,266
Record.

347
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:22,143
- Now play back.
- Bring it up 50%.

348
00:31:23,228 --> 00:31:24,229
Now play back.

349
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:26,106
- He's ready.
- We got it.

350
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:28,274
Clear out.

351
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:31,861
What are your prime directives?

352
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:36,157
Serve the public trust.
Protect the innocent. Uphold the law.

353
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:42,414
That's good. That's very good.

354
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:53,299
I fuckin' love that guy.

355
00:32:31,504 --> 00:32:34,299
- It's Supercop.
- Look at that fuckin' gun.

356
00:32:50,732 --> 00:32:51,941
Shit.

357
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:55,403
- This guy is really good.
- He's not a guy, he's a machine.

358
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:58,198
What are they gonna do? Replace us?

359
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:06,706
Come on.

360
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:13,838
Reed! He needs a car.

361
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:18,551
Thank you.

362
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:21,096
Sure. Any time.

363
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:23,682
Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy.

364
00:33:58,133 --> 00:34:00,343
I'd buy that for a dollar.

365
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:18,153
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- Empty the register. Put it in the bag.

366
00:34:18,278 --> 00:34:19,779
Excuse me?

367
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:23,408
Give me your money, all of it,
and don't fuck with me!

368
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:25,577
Now, move!

369
00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:28,288
Open the safe, pops.

370
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:31,499
- Open the goddamn safe!
- We don't have a safe.

371
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:35,545
Shit. There's your goddamn safe!
Open the son of a bitch!

372
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,675
I'll count to three and you better
open that son of a bitch. Come on!

373
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,011
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

374
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:46,681
- I'll open the safe.
- Good boy.

375
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:52,854
You better open that
on the count of three. One, two...

376
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:57,650
Fuck me.

377
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:00,362
Drop the gun.
You are under arrest.

378
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:04,449
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

379
00:35:10,038 --> 00:35:11,706
Fuck me!

380
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:25,303
Thank you for your cooperation.
Good night.

381
00:35:26,596 --> 00:35:29,057
I'll buy that for a dollar!

382
00:35:46,783 --> 00:35:49,160
Don't touch me!

383
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:52,622
- We don't want your money!
- We want you!

384
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:57,460
Take it easy! We're not gonna hurt you!

385
00:35:57,585 --> 00:36:01,673
- There's too much hair.
- I know. Give her a haircut.

386
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,680
Hey! There's more hair... down there!

387
00:36:12,392 --> 00:36:13,852
No!

388
00:36:24,988 --> 00:36:27,365
Let the woman go.
You are under arrest.

389
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,825
Shit.

390
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:33,163
You better back up, pal,
cos he's gonna kill her!

391
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:36,458
He's gonna kill her!

392
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:52,098
Your move, creep.

393
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:55,310
It's OK!

394
00:36:58,813 --> 00:37:01,399
Oh, God, I was so scared.

395
00:37:01,524 --> 00:37:03,568
Thank you! Thank you!

396
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:09,074
Madam, you have suffered
an emotional shock.

397
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,409
I will notify a rape crisis centre.

398
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,924
All units. close intersection...

399
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:36,851
I don't care. Get those men
by the stairs now. Hit it!

400
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,440
Terrorism has never been a factor
in city politics before.

401
00:37:42,565 --> 00:37:47,112
But today, former city councilman
Ron Miller entered city hall with a gun.

402
00:37:47,237 --> 00:37:51,199
He's now on the second floor, holding
Mayor Gibson and his staff hostage.

403
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:55,036
We do believe that Miller
has killed one of the hostages.

404
00:37:55,578 --> 00:37:59,457
- Lieutenant, what's next?
- We wait. Terrorism is a tricky business.

405
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:03,628
Massive and immediate retaliation
is the best policy but...

406
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:06,089
- Excuse us.
- Where are you goin'?

407
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:18,560
Hey, let's have some crowd control.
Get these people back.

408
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:23,023
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- Keep him talking.

409
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:37,829
OK, Miller. Don't hurt the mayor.
We'll give you whatever you want.

410
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:40,415
First, don't fuck with me.

411
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,584
I'm a desperate man.

412
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:45,086
And second,
I want some fresh coffee!

413
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:48,548
And third, I want a recount.

414
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:51,843
And no matter how it turns out,
I want my old job back.

415
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:54,346
- OK.
- And I want a bigger office.

416
00:38:55,764 --> 00:38:59,559
And I want a new car.
And I want the city to pay for it all!

417
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:01,686
What kind of car. Miller?

418
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:06,775
Something with reclining leather seats
that goes fast and gets shitty gas mileage.

419
00:39:06,983 --> 00:39:09,986
How about the... 6000 SUX?

420
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,155
Yeah.

421
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,907
OK, sure.

422
00:39:14,908 --> 00:39:17,911
What about cruise control?
Does it come with that?

423
00:39:18,328 --> 00:39:22,540
No problem, Miller. Let the mayor go,
we'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.

424
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:27,003
Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!

425
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,133
When people jerk me off, I kill 'em.
Do you wanna see?

426
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,558
Get up, Your Honour. Get up.
Your public wants to see you.

427
00:39:42,435 --> 00:39:44,604
Nobody ever takes me seriously.

428
00:39:45,438 --> 00:39:49,192
Well, get serious now
and kiss the mayor's ass goodbye.

429
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:05,583
RoboCop. Who is he? What is he?
Where does he come from?

430
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:10,338
He is OCP's newest soldier
in their crime-management programme.

431
00:40:10,463 --> 00:40:12,966
OCP spokesmen claim
the fearless machine

432
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:15,176
has crooks on the run in Old Detroit.

433
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:19,097
Today. kids at Lee lacocca
Elementary School got to meet in person

434
00:40:19,222 --> 00:40:22,017
what their parents only
read about in comic books.

435
00:40:22,142 --> 00:40:26,688
Robo. excuse me. Any special message
for all the kids watching at home?

436
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:29,774
Stay out of trouble.

437
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:35,613
More fighting in the Mexican crisis when
American troops participated in a raid

438
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:40,368
with Mexican nationals against
rebel rocket positions in Acapulco.

439
00:40:40,493 --> 00:40:41,578
Now this.

440
00:40:41,703 --> 00:40:45,290
Red alert. Red alert. Red alert.

441
00:40:45,707 --> 00:40:50,170
- You crossed my line of death.
- Then dismantle your MX stockpile.

442
00:40:50,295 --> 00:40:52,380
Pakistan is threatening my border.

443
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:54,966
That's it. buster.
No more military aid.

444
00:40:58,178 --> 00:41:01,056
"Nukem".
Get them before they get you.

445
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:09,356
Today labour leaders agreed to sanction
construction of OCP's Delta City.

446
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:12,359
creating an estimated
one million new jobs.

447
00:41:12,484 --> 00:41:16,446
despite questions about worker safety
in dangerous Old Detroit.

448
00:41:16,571 --> 00:41:20,283
Robert Morton. Vice President.
Security Concepts. OCP.

449
00:41:20,408 --> 00:41:22,160
I can't comment on Delta City.

450
00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:24,704
It's not my division. But I will say this.

451
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:30,001
At Security Concepts. we're projecting
the end of crime in Old Detroit in 40 days.

452
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:33,046
There's a new guy in town.
His name's RoboCop.

453
00:41:36,091 --> 00:41:39,803
Hey, hey, Bobby boy.
Vice president. Congratulations.

454
00:41:39,928 --> 00:41:43,264
- Handball Tuesday night?
- Bill, I'd love to, but I got a date.

455
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,433
Couple of models coming to my place.

456
00:41:45,558 --> 00:41:47,602
I'd buy that for a dollar.

457
00:41:51,398 --> 00:41:53,441
Welcome to the club, Bob.

458
00:41:56,986 --> 00:42:00,949
You're making a real name for yourself
in Security Concepts with RoboCop.

459
00:42:01,074 --> 00:42:04,661
- We try.
- Let me in on the bottom line, pal.

460
00:42:04,786 --> 00:42:06,871
I hear Jones was plenty pissed.

461
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:10,625
He's got this killer rep,
but it's a smokescreen.

462
00:42:12,252 --> 00:42:14,838
He's lost his teeth. The guy's a pussy.

463
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:17,173
Are we talkin' about
the same Dick Jones?

464
00:42:17,298 --> 00:42:20,260
He's old, we're young.
And that's life.

465
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:35,233
I gotta go.
I got a meeting.

466
00:42:45,285 --> 00:42:47,704
Congratulations, Bob.

467
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:49,664
Thanks.

468
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:53,418
I remember when I was
a young executive for this company.

469
00:42:53,543 --> 00:42:56,254
I used to call the Old Man funny names.

470
00:42:56,379 --> 00:42:58,423
"Iron butt."

471
00:42:58,548 --> 00:43:00,592
"Boner."

472
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:03,011
Once I even called him...

473
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,764
"asshole".

474
00:43:10,393 --> 00:43:13,188
But there was always respect.

475
00:43:13,313 --> 00:43:15,774
I always knew where the line was drawn.

476
00:43:17,776 --> 00:43:20,987
And you just stepped over it, buddy boy.

477
00:43:22,113 --> 00:43:27,744
You've insulted me, and you've insulted
this company with your bastard creation.

478
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:30,997
I had a guaranteed
military sale with ED-209.

479
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:34,876
Renovation programme.
Spare parts for 25 years.

480
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:37,545
Who cares if it worked or not?

481
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:42,384
The Old Man thought
it was pretty important... Dick.

482
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:53,103
You know,

483
00:43:53,228 --> 00:43:55,271
he's a sweet old man.

484
00:43:57,816 --> 00:43:59,859
And he means well.

485
00:44:01,194 --> 00:44:03,238
But he's not gonna live for ever.

486
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:07,617
And I'm number two around here.

487
00:44:09,202 --> 00:44:11,246
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

488
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:15,792
You just...

489
00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:19,170
fucked with the wrong guy.

490
00:44:19,504 --> 00:44:22,215
You're out of your fuckin' mind.

491
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:32,809
You better pray that that unholy
monster of yours doesn't screw up.

492
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:55,040
- You hungry?
- No, thanks.

493
00:45:44,005 --> 00:45:46,758
Goddamn rebels blew up
the airport in Acapulco.

494
00:45:46,883 --> 00:45:50,720
Great. We were going there next week.
Hey, what was that?

495
00:45:55,809 --> 00:45:58,561
Hey, look. Bucket boy's on line.

496
00:46:14,536 --> 00:46:16,997
Hey. Hey, halt.

497
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:19,165
Stop! Wait a minute!

498
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:22,460
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know. He just left.

499
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:25,422
Just left?

500
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,632
Roosevelt!

501
00:46:27,757 --> 00:46:29,801
Rosie, we got a problem.

502
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:34,889
Out of the way.

503
00:46:35,015 --> 00:46:37,058
Take a look at this.

504
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:42,313
Shit. Call Bob Morton.

505
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:54,534
Jerry, book him.
I'll catch up with you later.

506
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:03,418
Hello. I haven't really had
a chance to introduce myself.

507
00:47:04,085 --> 00:47:06,129
I'm Anne Lewis.

508
00:47:07,297 --> 00:47:09,341
Do you have a name?

509
00:47:15,305 --> 00:47:17,474
How can I help you, Officer Lewis?

510
00:47:19,476 --> 00:47:21,519
That's not really what I meant.

511
00:47:21,644 --> 00:47:23,980
Don't you have a name?

512
00:47:28,151 --> 00:47:31,321
Murphy. It's you.

513
00:47:36,117 --> 00:47:39,496
- You really don't remember me, do you?
- Excuse me.

514
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:44,292
I have to go. Somewhere
there is a crime happening.

515
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:46,044
Stop!

516
00:47:47,253 --> 00:47:50,090
- What did you talk to him about?
- Nothing.

517
00:47:50,215 --> 00:47:52,008
- Shit.
- Shit.

518
00:47:55,345 --> 00:47:58,390
Stop! Hey, you there, stop!

519
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:06,439
You're in a lot of trouble, Officer.

520
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:08,400
Come on.

521
00:48:09,025 --> 00:48:11,695
I was assured full cooperation
by this precinct.

522
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,948
If it gets screwed up by your grunts,
I'll have your job.

523
00:48:15,073 --> 00:48:17,617
- What's the update?
- It's hard to be 100%.

524
00:48:17,742 --> 00:48:20,578
This system wasn't designed
for a somatic response.

525
00:48:20,704 --> 00:48:22,831
He had a dream. A dream.

526
00:48:22,956 --> 00:48:26,126
- This cop saw fit to question him.
- I didn't question him.

527
00:48:26,251 --> 00:48:29,087
- I asked him his name. He didn't know.
- Oh, great.

528
00:48:29,212 --> 00:48:31,214
Let me make it real clear for you.

529
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:35,176
He doesn't have a name.
He's got a program. He's product.

530
00:48:35,301 --> 00:48:37,345
- Is that clear?
- Sure.

531
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:40,181
- I say pull him in, run a systems check.
- Take a week.

532
00:48:40,306 --> 00:48:44,394
You wanna take him off line because
he had a dream? Are you kidding?

533
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:46,563
Let's get out of here.

534
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:49,566
Listen, Reed. Try to keep
one thing in mind.

535
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:54,612
This project doesn't concern cops.
It's classified. It's OCP.

536
00:48:54,738 --> 00:48:56,781
Got it, mister?

537
00:48:59,075 --> 00:49:01,995
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

538
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:07,709
Sorry, Sarge. I fucked up.

539
00:49:09,878 --> 00:49:14,215
Forget it, kid.
This guy's a serious asshole.

540
00:49:45,205 --> 00:49:48,958
Give me all your money, bookworm,
or I blow your brains out.

541
00:49:54,464 --> 00:49:56,549
Now fill it up on number seven.

542
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:04,724
Don't do nothin' stupid, man.

543
00:50:07,018 --> 00:50:09,062
I'm a good shot.

544
00:50:11,189 --> 00:50:13,400
I could hit you in the eye from here.

545
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:27,038
Hey, man? What you readin' in there?

546
00:50:33,086 --> 00:50:37,007
You a college boy or somethin'? Huh?

547
00:50:38,133 --> 00:50:43,388
I bet you think you're pretty smart, huh?
Think you could outsmart a bullet?

548
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:46,057
What do you say we find out? Huh?

549
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:49,644
I'm talkin' to you!
What do you say? Huh? Huh?

550
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:51,604
I'm talkin' to you!

551
00:50:53,732 --> 00:50:55,775
Drop it.

552
00:50:59,195 --> 00:51:01,573
Dead or alive, you are coming with me.

553
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:08,079
I know you.

554
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:11,916
You're dead.
We killed you.

555
00:51:14,169 --> 00:51:16,212
We killed you!

556
00:51:17,922 --> 00:51:19,966
We killed you!

557
00:51:30,602 --> 00:51:33,855
You're dead. We killed you.

558
00:52:19,693 --> 00:52:22,028
Who are you?

559
00:52:24,072 --> 00:52:26,116
Who are you?

560
00:52:40,922 --> 00:52:43,883
- Can I help you, sir?
- No.

561
00:52:44,009 --> 00:52:46,469
What is it exactly that you want?

562
00:52:47,178 --> 00:52:50,056
Hey! You can't enter here.

563
00:52:50,515 --> 00:52:53,059
Wait a second. Hey, just a minute.

564
00:52:53,935 --> 00:52:56,438
This is a restricted area.

565
00:54:04,756 --> 00:54:06,883
Murphy. It's you.

566
00:54:07,217 --> 00:54:09,511
Murphy. It's you.

567
00:54:09,761 --> 00:54:11,805
Murphy. It's you.

568
00:55:07,652 --> 00:55:11,573
Welcome. shopper. Let's take
a stroll through your new home.

569
00:55:11,698 --> 00:55:16,786
This is a one-family house. situated
near schools and shopping centres.

570
00:55:16,911 --> 00:55:20,081
This progressive development
has a growth factor of seven.

571
00:55:42,604 --> 00:55:44,647
Wow!

572
00:55:45,231 --> 00:55:47,901
Can you do that, Dad?

573
00:55:56,034 --> 00:55:58,828
It doesn't matter
who cooks in your family.

574
00:55:58,953 --> 00:56:03,041
because this kitchen by Food Concepts
makes everything...

575
00:56:23,603 --> 00:56:25,647
Dad.

576
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,820
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

577
00:56:51,423 --> 00:56:53,842
I really have to tell you something.

578
00:56:57,679 --> 00:56:59,264
I love you.

579
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:14,904
Hey. have you thought it all over?
Why not make me an offer?

580
00:57:48,021 --> 00:57:50,607
Where is Clarence Boddicker?

581
00:57:56,654 --> 00:57:58,156
OK.

582
00:58:05,372 --> 00:58:07,415
Let's talk.

583
00:58:11,127 --> 00:58:13,171
You son of a bitch.

584
00:58:17,509 --> 00:58:20,595
There's just something
about the way it sounds.

585
00:58:21,596 --> 00:58:23,515
"Vice president."

586
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,684
It just turns me on.

587
00:58:26,267 --> 00:58:30,647
God, you girls are so great.
I love to be with intelligent women.

588
00:58:30,772 --> 00:58:33,149
Smart is so sexy.

589
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,446
I know. Sometimes I could
just think of something,

590
00:58:38,571 --> 00:58:41,992
and it could just get me so horny.

591
00:58:43,952 --> 00:58:47,038
Yeah, well, a mind
is a terrible thing to waste.

592
00:58:48,832 --> 00:58:50,875
I get bored so easily.

593
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:55,797
Yeah. And you need
lots of stimulation, Bobby.

594
00:58:58,216 --> 00:58:59,968
Yes, I do.

595
00:59:00,093 --> 00:59:02,137
- Don't move.
- I won't.

596
00:59:04,723 --> 00:59:08,143
- Bob...
- What?

597
00:59:08,268 --> 00:59:11,563
- Bob, save some for me.
- Don't worry.

598
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,819
Must be the champagne. Stay here.

599
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,244
How ya doin'?

600
00:59:27,996 --> 00:59:30,040
Bitches, leave.

601
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:34,210
Gee, Bobby. Bye.

602
00:59:34,961 --> 00:59:36,838
You gonna call me?

603
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,883
What the fuck are you doing?

604
00:59:40,008 --> 00:59:44,512
Do you know who I am? If you think
you're gonna get away with this...

605
00:59:47,557 --> 00:59:49,225
Goddamn it!

606
00:59:52,395 --> 00:59:55,023
Stop! I'll give you anything you want!

607
00:59:55,148 --> 00:59:57,442
Just please don't kill me, all right?

608
01:00:01,905 --> 01:00:05,575
Hello. buddy boy. Dick Jones here.

609
01:00:06,284 --> 01:00:11,247
I guess you're on your knees about now.
begging for your life.

610
01:00:11,748 --> 01:00:15,502
Pathetic. You don't feel
so cocky now. do you. Bob?

611
01:00:15,627 --> 01:00:18,588
Whatever he's payin' you,
I'll double it right now.

612
01:00:18,713 --> 01:00:21,758
You know what the tragedy is here. Bob?

613
01:00:22,842 --> 01:00:25,053
We could have been friends.

614
01:00:25,512 --> 01:00:28,431
But you wouldn't go through
proper channels.

615
01:00:28,556 --> 01:00:30,767
You went over my head.

616
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,770
That hurt.

617
01:00:33,895 --> 01:00:38,650
But life goes on. It's an old story.
the fight for love and glory. huh. Bob?

618
01:00:40,819 --> 01:00:43,321
It helps if you think of it as a game. Bob.

619
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,576
Every game has a winner... and a loser.

620
01:00:56,668 --> 01:01:00,255
I'm cashing you out. Bob.

621
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:24,154
I don't wanna pay that, Sal.

622
01:01:25,572 --> 01:01:29,492
I don't give a shit what you wanna pay.
I set the prices here.

623
01:01:29,617 --> 01:01:34,122
Listen, pal. Maybe you haven't heard.
I'm the guy in Old Detroit.

624
01:01:34,247 --> 01:01:36,583
You want space in my marketplace?

625
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:39,294
You're gonna have to give me
a volume discount.

626
01:01:39,419 --> 01:01:41,796
I'm not into discounts.

627
01:01:41,921 --> 01:01:45,216
Joe, show the man what
we brought him for Christmas.

628
01:01:53,308 --> 01:01:56,936
Think about it, chum.
Good business is where you find it.

629
01:02:03,526 --> 01:02:06,488
OK, let me try to
put this in perspective.

630
01:02:08,031 --> 01:02:10,075
You killed a bunch of cops.

631
01:02:10,825 --> 01:02:14,746
The word is you've got a lot
of heavy connections downtown,

632
01:02:15,997 --> 01:02:18,875
and you make a lot of
my friends nervous.

633
01:02:21,878 --> 01:02:24,005
A lot of people

634
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:28,301
would love to see a guy like me
and a guy like you out of business.

635
01:02:29,344 --> 01:02:31,805
I don't know. I don't know.

636
01:02:32,764 --> 01:02:35,475
Maybe I'm just not making myself clear.

637
01:02:38,186 --> 01:02:40,230
I don't wanna fuck with you, Sal.

638
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:45,735
But I got the connections.
I got the sales organisation.

639
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:52,200
I got the muscle to shove enough of
this factory so far up your stupid wop ass

640
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:54,744
that you'll shit snow for a year.

641
01:02:54,869 --> 01:02:58,206
Frankie, blow this cocksucker's head off.

642
01:02:58,331 --> 01:03:01,418
Ooh, guns, guns, guns.

643
01:03:03,545 --> 01:03:07,507
Come on, Sal!
The Tigers are playin'... tonight.

644
01:03:09,509 --> 01:03:12,053
I never miss a game.

645
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,144
Just kidding.

646
01:03:31,531 --> 01:03:33,325
Go!

647
01:03:37,537 --> 01:03:39,080
Go.

648
01:03:55,889 --> 01:03:59,392
Come quietly or there will be trouble.

649
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,937
Oh, fuck you.

650
01:05:38,533 --> 01:05:42,370
Clarence Boddicker,
you are under arrest.

651
01:05:42,495 --> 01:05:45,206
You have the right to remain silent.

652
01:05:45,498 --> 01:05:47,208
Fuck you.

653
01:05:52,422 --> 01:05:54,716
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!

654
01:05:55,133 --> 01:05:57,260
I'm protected.
I've got protection!

655
01:05:57,385 --> 01:06:00,388
- You have the right to an attorney.
- What is this shit?

656
01:06:05,393 --> 01:06:07,854
Goddamn it. Goddamn it!

657
01:06:07,979 --> 01:06:10,815
Listen to me!
Listen to me, you fuck!

658
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:15,070
There's another guy.
He's OCP. He's the senior president.

659
01:06:15,987 --> 01:06:18,907
Anything you say
may be used against you.

660
01:06:19,032 --> 01:06:21,034
It's Dick Jones!

661
01:06:25,538 --> 01:06:28,083
Don't you get it, you cocksucker?

662
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:31,086
I work for Dick Jones!

663
01:06:31,211 --> 01:06:33,004
Dick Jones!

664
01:06:33,129 --> 01:06:35,173
He's the number two guy at OCP.

665
01:06:35,298 --> 01:06:37,342
OCP runs the cops.

666
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:41,054
You're a cop.

667
01:06:43,765 --> 01:06:45,266
Cop.

668
01:06:55,568 --> 01:06:58,321
Yes, I am a cop.

669
01:07:02,409 --> 01:07:06,246
- I don't like it either, but listen...
- You listen to me, you asshole!

670
01:07:06,454 --> 01:07:10,375
You're talking about shutting down
a major metropolitan police force!

671
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,753
Without cops, this city
would tear itself apart!

672
01:07:13,878 --> 01:07:16,631
The union thinks you should know
we had a strike vote.

673
01:07:16,756 --> 01:07:20,218
- We lost five guys last week.
- We're gettin' creamed out there.

674
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,856
- Book him.
- What's the charge?

675
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:40,113
He's a cop killer.

676
01:07:45,577 --> 01:07:46,995
Shit.

677
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,998
Just give me my fuckin' phone call.

678
01:07:57,464 --> 01:08:00,425
I understand. The lawyers'll
have you out in 24 hours.

679
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,594
Just don't say anything else.

680
01:08:03,428 --> 01:08:05,472
Jesus, you really screwed up.

681
01:09:08,535 --> 01:09:11,830
Don't you get it?
I work for Dick Jones!

682
01:09:11,955 --> 01:09:13,039
Dick Jones!

683
01:09:15,834 --> 01:09:17,794
I work for Dick Jones!

684
01:09:17,919 --> 01:09:21,715
He runs OCP.
OCP runs the cops.

685
01:09:25,969 --> 01:09:30,140
Come in, Officer. I don't usually
see anyone without an appointment.

686
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:34,728
- In your case, I'll make an exception.
- You are under arrest.

687
01:09:34,853 --> 01:09:38,023
- On what charge?
- Aiding and abetting a known felon.

688
01:09:39,357 --> 01:09:41,735
Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble.

689
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:46,072
- You'd better take me in.
- I will.

690
01:09:59,794 --> 01:10:01,838
What's the matter, Officer?

691
01:10:04,341 --> 01:10:06,676
I'll tell you what's the matter.

692
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:10,180
It's a little insurance policy
called Directive 4.

693
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,516
My little contribution
to your psychological profile.

694
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:19,647
Any attempt to arrest a senior officer
of OCP results in shutdown.

695
01:10:23,234 --> 01:10:25,070
What did you think?

696
01:10:26,446 --> 01:10:29,157
That you were an ordinary police officer?

697
01:10:29,282 --> 01:10:34,287
You're our product. And we can't have
our products turning against us, can we?

698
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:41,336
Still a little fight left in you.

699
01:10:46,841 --> 01:10:50,136
Maybe you'd like to meet a friend of mine.

700
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:58,395
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

701
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,980
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

702
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:15,430
Put Lieutenant Hedgecock on the line.
There's trouble in the tower.

703
01:13:27,168 --> 01:13:29,754
Prepare to fire.

704
01:13:29,963 --> 01:13:32,340
- Wait a second!
- He's a cop, for God's sake!

705
01:13:32,465 --> 01:13:35,260
- You can't do that!
- We have orders to destroy it.

706
01:13:35,552 --> 01:13:38,013
- Aw, shit!
- You're maniacs!

707
01:13:38,138 --> 01:13:40,390
Fire at will!

708
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,659
Move in!

709
01:14:56,841 --> 01:15:00,595
Murphy! Murphy, it's me.

710
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,266
Lewis.

711
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,867
Lieutenant, level three!
He's on level three!

712
01:15:22,993 --> 01:15:25,036
Open fire!

713
01:15:42,846 --> 01:15:44,848
It's back.

714
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:47,350
Big is back. Because bigger is better.

715
01:15:51,771 --> 01:15:54,399
Good evening. I'm Jesse Perkins.
with Casey Wong.

716
01:15:54,524 --> 01:15:56,568
Top story: Santa Barbara.

717
01:15:56,693 --> 01:16:00,488
10.000 acres of wooded residential land
were scorched in an instant

718
01:16:00,613 --> 01:16:04,326
when a laser cannon aboard
the Strategic Defense Peace Platform

719
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:07,912
misfired today during
routine startup tests. Casey?

720
01:16:08,038 --> 01:16:12,709
It was a day of mourning for the families
of 113 people known dead at this hour.

721
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:17,714
among them two former United States
presidents who had retired in the area.

722
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:20,008
A day of mourning for a country.

723
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:23,970
Police union representatives and OCP
continue negotiations today

724
01:16:24,095 --> 01:16:27,349
in hopes of averting
a city-wide strike by police.

725
01:16:27,474 --> 01:16:30,226
scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight.

726
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:31,936
Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.

727
01:16:32,062 --> 01:16:35,065
They're still on duty.
but what about tomorrow?

728
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:38,652
That's what we asked people in
the crime-plagued Lexington area.

729
01:16:38,777 --> 01:16:43,531
They're public servants. They got job
security. They're not supposed to strike.

730
01:16:43,657 --> 01:16:45,992
It's a free society.

731
01:16:46,117 --> 01:16:49,621
Except there ain't nothin' free.
because there's no guarantees.

732
01:16:49,746 --> 01:16:53,208
You're on your own.
It's the law of the jungle.

733
01:17:08,807 --> 01:17:10,850
Hiya... Barbara.

734
01:17:11,935 --> 01:17:14,145
Listen, I'm here to see Dick Jones.

735
01:17:14,979 --> 01:17:17,857
But when I'm done,
I've got some free time.

736
01:17:17,983 --> 01:17:21,403
Maybe you could... fit me in.

737
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:24,948
He's expecting you, Mr Boddicker.

738
01:17:28,743 --> 01:17:31,204
You can keep the gum.

739
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:40,505
Hey, Dickie boy. How's tricks?

740
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:44,509
- That thing is still alive.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

741
01:17:44,634 --> 01:17:48,221
The officer who arrested you.
The one you spilled your guts to.

742
01:17:50,223 --> 01:17:53,476
Take a look at my face, Dick.

743
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:55,645
He was trying to kill me.

744
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,814
He's a cyborg, you idiot!

745
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:01,651
He recorded every word you said.

746
01:18:01,776 --> 01:18:04,237
His memory is admissible as evidence.

747
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:07,240
You involved me.

748
01:18:08,742 --> 01:18:10,660
You're gonna have to kill it.

749
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,124
Well, listen, chief.

750
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:20,253
Your company built the fucking thing.

751
01:18:20,378 --> 01:18:22,714
Now I gotta deal with it?

752
01:18:22,839 --> 01:18:25,133
I don't have time for this bullshit.

753
01:18:26,092 --> 01:18:29,804
Suit yourself. But Delta City
begins construction in two months.

754
01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:32,474
That's two million workers
living in trailers.

755
01:18:32,599 --> 01:18:36,728
That means drugs, gambling, prostitution.

756
01:18:37,645 --> 01:18:42,067
Virgin territory for the man
who knows how to open up new markets.

757
01:18:42,192 --> 01:18:46,196
One man could control it all, Clarence.

758
01:18:47,739 --> 01:18:50,867
Well, I guess we're gonna
be friends after all,

759
01:18:51,576 --> 01:18:53,620
Richard.

760
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:02,295
Destroy it.

761
01:19:03,213 --> 01:19:05,715
We're gonna need some major fire power.

762
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:11,763
You got access to military weaponry?

763
01:19:11,888 --> 01:19:14,516
We practically are the military.

764
01:19:52,637 --> 01:19:55,640
- Did you bring the gun?
- The precinct was deserted.

765
01:19:55,765 --> 01:19:58,143
Half the force didn't
show up for work today.

766
01:19:58,268 --> 01:20:01,938
Everyone else walks out at midnight.
I guess we're on strike.

767
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:04,107
I wasn't sure what you needed.

768
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:06,276
I sort of grabbed things.

769
01:20:08,361 --> 01:20:10,405
Your gun.

770
01:20:11,156 --> 01:20:13,074
You asked for this.

771
01:20:16,953 --> 01:20:19,539
I brought you some food.

772
01:20:20,123 --> 01:20:22,667
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

773
01:20:46,316 --> 01:20:49,194
You may not like what
you're going to see.

774
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,189
It's really good to see you again, Murphy.

775
01:21:31,194 --> 01:21:34,698
Murphy had a wife and son.
What happened to them?

776
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:39,411
Well, after the funeral, she moved away.

777
01:21:39,536 --> 01:21:41,579
Where did they go?

778
01:21:42,706 --> 01:21:44,791
She thought you were dead.

779
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:46,960
She started over again.

780
01:21:49,295 --> 01:21:51,339
I can feel them.

781
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,303
But I can't remember them.

782
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:05,228
Leave me alone.

783
01:22:52,025 --> 01:22:54,861
Happy birthday. Dave.
She's from me.

784
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:59,157
Well. hey. can I have you both?

785
01:23:00,033 --> 01:23:02,952
Sure! We've had our shots.

786
01:23:04,996 --> 01:23:06,915
I'd buy that for a dollar.

787
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:15,757
Hey, Emil. How's the "Grey Bar Hotel"?

788
01:23:15,882 --> 01:23:20,178
Not bad. They let me keep the shirt.
And nobody popped my cherry.

789
01:23:20,303 --> 01:23:22,430
Emil, how you doin', man?
Good to see you.

790
01:23:22,555 --> 01:23:25,725
Hey, hey! First they
let me out of jail for free.

791
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:30,855
Then what do I find in the prison
parking lot but a brand new 6000 SUX?

792
01:23:30,981 --> 01:23:33,066
Still got the factory sticker on it.

793
01:23:33,191 --> 01:23:37,278
Hey, Clarence. Joey's got
a car just like yours, man.

794
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:40,782
Yo, Clarence.
What do you think, buddy?

795
01:23:47,163 --> 01:23:49,958
What have you got there, Clarence, huh?

796
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:54,045
Whoa, a new toy! Can I play?

797
01:23:56,881 --> 01:23:59,759
- Watch this.
- Wait a minute. Clarence. Clarence!

798
01:24:02,387 --> 01:24:04,639
Aw, shit!

799
01:24:06,891 --> 01:24:08,935
- Fuck!
- Nice car, Joe.

800
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:10,979
Let me try that.

801
01:24:11,104 --> 01:24:14,274
The Cobra Assault Cannon.
State-of-the-art bang-bang.

802
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:23,867
I like it!

803
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:26,745
- Give it up, faggot. Let a man do this.
- Get your own!

804
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:28,913
Come on!

805
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:42,552
Do it, Emil!

806
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:51,019
Heads up, you guys.

807
01:24:59,569 --> 01:25:01,780
He's in the steel mill. Let's go.

808
01:25:01,905 --> 01:25:04,699
All right, cut the horseshit!
We're movin' out!

809
01:25:04,824 --> 01:25:09,079
- Come on, Emil. Get your ass in the van.
- Come on, lard-ass. Let's move it.

810
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:11,247
I'll get you, faggot!

811
01:26:05,468 --> 01:26:07,512
What are you doing?

812
01:26:08,304 --> 01:26:10,765
My targeting system is a little messed up.

813
01:26:14,019 --> 01:26:16,187
Can I help you?

814
01:26:16,313 --> 01:26:18,356
Aim for me.

815
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,994
- Are you locked in now?
- Yes.

816
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:35,123
A little more to the left.

817
01:26:35,248 --> 01:26:36,583
Here.

818
01:26:44,549 --> 01:26:47,260
- I figure that's dead on.
- Thank you.

819
01:27:06,404 --> 01:27:08,448
Come on, man, let's smoke 'em.

820
01:27:10,033 --> 01:27:13,495
The wrecking crew is here!
Where is that metallic motherfucker?

821
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:15,914
Zip it up, man.

822
01:27:16,039 --> 01:27:17,999
Nothin' fancy. Just kill him.

823
01:27:18,124 --> 01:27:20,251
Emil! In the van.

824
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:26,800
- You should get out of here now.
- Hey, we're partners.

825
01:27:27,926 --> 01:27:29,969
Get the car.

826
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:08,091
- Damn it. Shit.
- Looking for me?

827
01:28:21,646 --> 01:28:25,025
Cut him off!
Go on, cut him off!

828
01:28:25,483 --> 01:28:27,527
Go! Go!

829
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:00,727
OK! Now I gotcha!

830
01:29:47,691 --> 01:29:49,734
Shit.

831
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:06,501
- Help me.
- Don't touch me, man!

832
01:30:08,545 --> 01:30:10,171
Help me.

833
01:30:28,857 --> 01:30:30,275
Shit.

834
01:30:57,969 --> 01:31:00,847
- Bye-bye, baby.
- Clarence!

835
01:31:26,956 --> 01:31:29,918
OK. I give up.

836
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:34,547
- I'm not arresting you any more.
- Hey, hey. Now wait a second.

837
01:31:41,513 --> 01:31:45,558
Wait a minute. You're taking this
kinda personal, aren't you?

838
01:31:45,684 --> 01:31:49,270
Come on, man.
You're making me nervous.

839
01:31:49,396 --> 01:31:51,564
You can't do this.

840
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:56,319
Don't mess around. Hey.
Come on, man, don't get cute.

841
01:32:01,491 --> 01:32:04,160
- Die, you bastard!
- Yeah!

842
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:06,413
Yeah, all right!

843
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:10,333
I got him, Clarence!

844
01:32:37,902 --> 01:32:40,363
Sayonara, RoboCop.

845
01:32:54,711 --> 01:32:56,755
Lewis!

846
01:32:57,630 --> 01:32:59,674
Lewis!

847
01:33:02,135 --> 01:33:04,971
Murphy, I'm a mess.

848
01:33:07,599 --> 01:33:09,934
They'll fix you.

849
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,187
They fix everything.

850
01:33:21,821 --> 01:33:23,782
The police strike could work for us.

851
01:33:23,907 --> 01:33:26,785
By the end of the week we can have
ED-209s in place in the city

852
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:29,204
and expect immediate public support.

853
01:33:29,329 --> 01:33:32,791
I've got one downstairs,
guarding the building now.

854
01:33:39,631 --> 01:33:42,676
You are illegally parked
on private property.

855
01:33:42,801 --> 01:33:46,096
You have 20 seconds
to move your vehicle.

856
01:34:21,339 --> 01:34:26,177
Because this corporation will live up
to the guiding principles of its founder.

857
01:34:26,302 --> 01:34:29,889
Courage. Strength. Conviction.

858
01:34:32,809 --> 01:34:37,647
We will meet each new challenge
with the same aggressive attitude.

859
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:51,578
- How can we help you, Officer?
- Dick Jones is wanted for murder.

860
01:34:51,911 --> 01:34:56,416
This is absurd. That thing
is a violent mechanical psychopath.

861
01:34:56,541 --> 01:35:01,171
My program will not allow me to act
against an officer of this company.

862
01:35:01,421 --> 01:35:04,466
These are serious charges.
What is your evidence?

863
01:35:14,934 --> 01:35:18,438
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

864
01:35:19,022 --> 01:35:21,983
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

865
01:35:22,984 --> 01:35:25,945
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

866
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:29,491
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

867
01:35:32,077 --> 01:35:35,121
Get up! I want a chopper. Now!

868
01:35:36,498 --> 01:35:38,792
We will walk to the roof very calmly.

869
01:35:39,334 --> 01:35:42,837
I will board the chopper with my hostage.

870
01:35:44,339 --> 01:35:46,383
Anybody tries to stop me,

871
01:35:47,634 --> 01:35:49,260
the old geezer gets it.

872
01:35:52,389 --> 01:35:54,432
Dick, you're fired!

873
01:35:56,309 --> 01:35:57,811
Thank you.

874
01:36:22,711 --> 01:36:25,255
Nice shootin', son. What's your name?

875
01:36:28,049 --> 01:36:30,093
Murphy.
