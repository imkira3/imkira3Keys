2
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:36,968
So what do you think
the dream means?

3
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,597
That your vagina is
completely disease-infested.

4
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,474
Shut up. For real.

5
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,184
Okay, babies...

6
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,730
"Babies are symbolic
of change and renewal.

7
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,231
<i>"If the baby
is a stranger to you,</i>

8
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:52,859
<i>"it may represent something
developing within yourself</i>

9
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,403
<i>"that is not yet
ready to be born."</i>

10
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:58,281
And it doesn't say anything
about babies in formaldehyde.

11
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,617
Okay, what about dogs?

12
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,327
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

13
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:06,122
"In mythology, the dog was often
seen as a messenger of the dead."

14
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:11,169
Then it just goes on and on about
some more psychobabble bullshit.

15
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,589
So, where are the kids?

16
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:18,051
<i>Did you have to, like, change
diapers and shit like that?</i>

17
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,553
Nope, the baby
was down when I got here,

18
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:24,098
and the four-year-old, he conked
out as soon as I read to him.

19
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:27,143
Do you think they have porn
in their DVD collection?

20
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:30,355
Like I really want to know
what Mr. Newton beats off to.

21
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,690
Well, it's not Mrs. Newton,
that's for sure.

22
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,695
<i>Case?</i>

23
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:38,863
Hang on.

24
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,953
<i>Look in the mirror.</i>

25
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:49,332
<i>Some people are doorways.</i>

26
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,174
Matty? Matty, are you up?

27
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,636
Hey, Rom, I think one
of the kids is awake.

28
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:02,845
I'm going to call
you back, okay?

29
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,931
<i>Good luck.
All</i> right.

30
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,593
Keep looking.

31
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,178
Maw?

32
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:45,263
Keep looking.

33
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,903
Keep looking.

34
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:06,868
What are you doing, Matty?

35
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:11,372
Keep looking.

36
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,124
Matty!

37
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:17,587
Matty, stop that.
We have to go to bed now.

38
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,213
Matty!

39
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,301
Jumby wants to be born now.

40
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,305
Are you sure
you're all right?

41
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,682
Yeah, no, it's fine,
it's not a big deal.

42
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:31,309
I'd feel better if you'd
had your eye checked out.

43
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,394
Okay, I will.

44
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:40,526
I'll see you guys
later, okay?

45
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,486
Hey, Dad.

46
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,821
Hi, Case. How was sitting?

47
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:26,114
Good.

48
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,949
There's cheesecake from
La Scarola, if you want.

49
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:32,120
Mmm, no, thanks. I'm just...
I'm gonna crash. Good night.

50
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,062
Oh, my God!

51
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,750
He was shining a mirror
in the baby's face.

52
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,210
And then he hit me.

53
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,920
Okay, that's creepy.

54
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:50,633
The kid's like four. I mean, he probably
didn't even know what he was doing.

55
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,843
It's bad luck, you know.

56
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:57,723
Newborns aren't supposed to see their own
reflection till they're at least a year old.

57
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,268
It means they'll die soon.

58
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,602
According to whom?

59
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:04,021
It's just one of those
superstitions, you know.

60
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,731
You're retarded.
She's retarded.

61
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,611
It's not like I'm saying I believe it, I'm
just saying it's one of those things.

62
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:15,783
Okay, so as far as we know, the universe
is roughly 15 billion years old.

63
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,118
Right?

64
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:21,622
So, if the universe had a beginning,
what happened before the beginning?

65
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:25,251
Einstein would tell us
that there was no before,

66
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,045
because time itself
did not yet exist.

67
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,133
So here's another
question for you.

68
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,260
How big is the universe?

69
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:39,724
Does the universe
just keep going on forever?

70
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:44,895
And if it doesn't just keep going on
forever, then what's beyond the edge?

71
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:54,322
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Here's the catch.

72
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,449
Since our universe began...

73
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,909
<i>Jumby wants
to be born now.</i>

74
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,162
...back where you started.

75
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,457
It'd be like
walking into a mirror.

76
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,546
ls everything
all right, Casey?

77
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,507
Yeah, I...
I just need to get some air.

78
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:44,705
So he texts me, like, the day after we went out.
And he put, "I miss you."

79
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:48,209
But then when I text him
back, he never replied.

80
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,920
And that was
like two days ago.

81
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,005
Case.

82
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,676
There's something
wrong with your eye.

83
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,179
What are you talking about?

84
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:03,349
I don't know, dude,
I think you should look.

85
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,565
It's called
heterochromia.

86
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,402
Meaning one iris is a different
color than the other.

87
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:18,823
Usually, it's congenital.
Sometimes it occurs after a blunt trauma.

88
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,783
On very rare occasions,
it might be indicative

89
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:24,120
of a malignant
melanoma of the iris.

90
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:27,456
In order to rule that out, I'll just
need to take a few digital pictures.

91
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,916
Okay.

92
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:33,462
I'll go ahead an insert a speculum
in order to keep your eyelids open.

93
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,005
Oh, God.

94
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,677
Just relax and
everything will be fine.

95
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,180
Ooh!

96
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,602
All right,
you're doing great.

97
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:51,981
Okay, go ahead and rest
your chin right here.

98
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,775
And keep your head very still while
we take a few pictures, all right?

99
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,610
Okay.
All right.

100
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,281
Good. Good.

101
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,329
So, does it hurt?

102
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:08,456
Mmm-mmm.

103
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,124
I think the light's
just a little bright

104
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,919
because of the eye-drops
that he gave me.

105
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,422
Baby, thank you
for coming with me.

106
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,799
I know I'm such a pain
in the ass right now.

107
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:21,886
Mmm-hmm! Yeah,
you are, yeah.

108
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:27,391
The good news is that my dad's not
gonna be home till tomorrow morning.

109
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,812
Does that mean
what I think it means?

110
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:32,897
Yes.

111
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:36,942
Great, 'cause, you know, 'cause
those glasses, they're just...

112
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:38,611
They're definitely
giving me wood.

113
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,280
Yeah, I don't
know what it is.

114
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,504
Hey. You all right?

115
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,422
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

116
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,191
<i>You know, it really
screws with your head,</i>

117
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,360
<i>what Mr. Shields was saying.</i>

118
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,112
That the universe
doesn't have an end.

119
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,031
I used to have
nightmares about it.

120
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:31,163
That the world would just stop spinning,
and we'd just fall off out into space.

121
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:33,457
I'd get so upset by it,

122
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:39,421
that one day we'd just keep falling
forever and ever and ever. No?

123
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:44,176
Yeah. No, I mean, I still get that
way when I think about dying.

124
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,138
You know, me and just
all my thoughts ending.

125
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:51,475
So you don't think there's
an afterlife. No, why?

126
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:58,274
Because I don't
feel her anywhere.

127
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:03,153
I mean, I remember
the last time I saw her.

128
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,199
<i>We went to the hospital.</i>

129
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:13,330
<i>And she was just sitting
there staring out the window.</i>

130
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:21,338
<i>It was almost as if
she was already gone.</i>

131
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,883
Did she say anything to you?

132
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,761
Well, she was adopted,

133
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,764
and I guess she found out
who her birth mother was.

134
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:40,733
<i>Then she died that night.</i>

135
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:49,700
You know, they say that it takes a
really long time when you hang yourself,

136
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,494
that some people
have second thoughts.

137
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,583
<i>And then they can't
do anything about it.</i>

138
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,214
God, I used to hate
her for leaving us.

139
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,512
Hey. Come here.

140
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,636
What? What? What?

141
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,181
Inside!
Inside the mirror! Inside...

142
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:53,365
I didn't see anything in the mirror.
What did you see, huh?

143
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,462
Mrs. Byrne,
what's going on?

144
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,256
It's the baby.
She wasn't breathing.

145
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,686
No, please,
don't take her!

146
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,147
She can't be dead!

147
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,067
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

148
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,947
I'm sorry,
ma'am, I'm sorry!

149
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:29,795
Well, we've gotten your lab results back.
And everything looks fine.

150
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:35,259
But there was one oddity.
Are you a twin by any chance, Miss Beldon?

151
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,220
No, I'm an only child.

152
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:42,474
Are you familiar with the term
"genetic mosaicism"?

153
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,352
Occasionally, when
you're dealing with twins,

154
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,729
the placentas
can become fused

155
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:50,732
and a certain amount of blood
will be exchanged back and forth.

156
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:55,320
I suppose the emerging pigmentation in
your affected iris could be the result

157
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:56,989
of that foreign
genetic strand.

158
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,700
Now I don't think it's anything
you need to worry about.

159
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:04,162
But you may wanna see a genetic
counselor, just to be on the safe side.

160
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,930
Excuse me.

161
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,060
Case, what's up?

162
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,562
I just got back
from the eye doctor,

163
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,856
and I got my test
results back.

164
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,566
And?

165
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,776
Am I a twin, Dad?

166
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,241
Yes.

167
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,951
Oh, my God.
You had...

168
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:45,203
You would have
had a brother.

169
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,957
Sweetheart, he died while
you were still in utero.

170
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,459
How?

171
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,710
Case, it's a long time ago...

172
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,171
Dad, I need to know.

173
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,512
It was a freak thing.

174
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,307
One of the umbilical cords
got twisted around his throat.

175
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,767
My Cord?

176
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:14,524
So, my brother died?

177
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,029
Is that why Mom
killed herself?

178
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:23,283
Your mother was clinically
depressed. Period.

179
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,412
The hard truth is that some
people come into this world

180
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,747
less equipped
for life than others.

181
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,499
Like my brother?

182
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,335
He was never
your brother, Case.

183
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,338
It was way too early
in the pregnancy for that.

184
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,298
Did he have a name?

185
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,842
Neither of you did yet.

186
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:43,804
We had nicknames
for you, though.

187
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,973
What was his nickname?

188
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,391
Jumby.

189
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,388
I can't believe I let you
talk me into coming down here.

190
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:11,349
Look, my mom obviously thought
this woman was important.

191
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:16,146
I mean, why would she have kept that article?
And this creepy photo?

192
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,231
The kid from your dreams.
Yes.

193
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,691
Okay.

194
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:22,861
You know, Case, if this was me, I would
just take one of my mom's Xanax,

195
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:24,237
and I would
just call it a day.

196
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:25,530
Okay, so just
wait in the car.

197
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:29,659
No, no. This is way too
bizarre for me to miss out on.

198
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,539
Excuse me.

199
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,918
We're here to see Sofi Kozma.
We called earlier.

200
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,629
Yeah, if you could
please sign in.

201
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,258
She is on the third
floor, room 307.

202
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,802
Let's go.

203
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:01,358
God, it smells like
diarrhea in there.

204
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,821
Look at the munchkin lady.

205
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,747
That guy's wearing a diaper.

206
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,916
God, I never want to get old.

207
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:22,420
No one does.
Mr. Walker suffered a stroke.

208
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:25,006
Now he's paralyzed
from the waist down.

209
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:30,971
But he doesn't suffer much any more.
His mind is elsewhere.

210
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,561
It's very homey here.

211
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:41,857
It's tolerable.
I've certainly endured worse.

212
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,861
What was over there?

213
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,154
Oh!

214
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:51,408
There used to be a mirror there.
I had it removed.

215
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,745
Are you a twin, Casey?

216
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:03,170
I was. I had a brother
who died in the womb.

217
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,255
How did you know that?

218
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:08,216
I used to have
a twin brother as well.

219
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,762
I can sense it sometimes in others.
Certain kind of manner.

220
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,391
I just recently found
out about my brother.

221
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:19,269
And that's sort of
what led me here today.

222
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,563
My mother's name
was Janet Beldon.

223
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:27,986
She passed away a few years ago,
but I found this in her things.

224
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,291
Did you know my mother?

225
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:44,419
No, I'm... I'm afraid not.

226
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:47,088
She never tried
to contact you?

227
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:52,844
Well, this is her.

228
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:56,890
Are you sure you've
never seen her?

229
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,350
I'm sorry, dear.

230
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:02,229
What about the boy in the reflection here.
Did you know him?

231
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,524
Get out!

232
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:08,735
Get out!

233
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:09,903
I'm sorry, what did I say...

234
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:10,987
Get out!

235
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,906
What the hell was that?

236
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:15,325
One second she's fine, and
then she does a bitch flip.

237
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,285
How did she know I was a twin?

238
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,038
She's crazy.
She probably has Old Timer's!

239
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,499
No. No, she knew something.

240
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,292
Come on, get real.

241
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:25,961
What if she does?

242
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:27,337
She doesn't!

243
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,423
Okay, so, you had
some weird dreams.

244
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,925
And then this thing
happens with your eye,

245
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,927
and then you found out
you would have had a brother.

246
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:38,306
Believe me, that alone is
enough to send me into therapy.

247
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,684
But that's all we're
talking about here.

248
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,353
Just some weird
coincidences. Yes.

249
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:44,646
No, what about
the Newtons' baby dying?

250
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:45,897
What about the Newtons' baby?

251
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:47,816
And what Matty said?

252
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:53,405
He said "Jumby," Romy. The nickname
that my parents used for my brother.

253
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,991
You're the
superstitious one here.

254
00:26:56,533 --> 00:27:01,079
You tell me there's not something really going on.
Because you know there is.

255
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,081
I'm not crazy, Romy.

256
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:08,670
But ever since Matty freaked
out that night, I...

257
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:15,802
I've been seeing things.

258
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:18,680
What kinds of things?

259
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,351
Do you believe in ghosts?

260
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,186
You know I do.

261
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,399
Do you think it's possible to be haunted
by someone who was never even born?

262
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,947
You owe me.

263
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:39,826
These things are not easy
to find these days.

264
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,036
Are you sure you want
to see what's on this?

265
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,120
I do.

266
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,860
Did it mean
anything to you?

267
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:00,824
It was the hospital
where my mom died.

268
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:07,664
Beyond that door,
that's where she hung herself.

269
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:14,421
I feel like she left all
that stuff for a reason.

270
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:18,633
You know, like she was, I don't
know, trying to tell me something.

271
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,886
Oh, my God, you think
I'm crazy, don't you?

272
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,680
No. No, I don't
think you're crazy.

273
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:28,435
A little hormonal maybe,
but you're not crazy.

274
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:30,937
Let's try to have some fun.

275
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,021
Okay.

276
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,106
Okay?
Yes.

277
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:41,156
Hey, kids!
Are we faded yet?

278
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:45,243
We're trying, but I'm gonna go to the
bar, if you girls want anything.

279
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,828
I will have a vodka
and Red Bull.

280
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,371
Me, too.

281
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:49,539
No.

282
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,086
Aw!

283
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,130
Why can't I meet
a nice guy like that?

284
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,049
Please, I set you up with Craig
Finch and you totally blew him off.

285
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,177
You wouldn't
even talk to him.

286
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,637
Well, that's
because he's too dramatic.

287
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,347
Oh, my God!

288
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,354
Somebody, help me!

289
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:23,318
No!

290
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:36,664
Somebody, help me!

291
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,045
Casey.

292
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:48,009
Casey! Case! Hey, hey, hey!
What happened?

293
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:49,886
Are YOU okay?
Huh?

294
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:52,472
Case.

295
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:54,807
Hey.

296
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,981
<i>Hey, girlie. You okay?</i>

297
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:04,400
I saw her.

298
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:05,526
<i>Who?</i>

299
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,861
My mother.

300
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,572
<i>You were drinking.
You were buzzed.</i>

301
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:10,782
<i>It was just a hallucination,
you know?</i>

302
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,785
This was different.
She was there.

303
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:19,832
What if the same thing that happened
to my mother is happening to me?

304
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,126
What if I end up
like she did?

305
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,544
<i>Have you talked
to your dad about it?</i>

306
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:26,422
He's out of town.

307
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:30,593
<i>Casey, you are not going
to end up like her, okay?</i>

308
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:34,722
How do you know?
You can't have it both ways, Romy.

309
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:38,893
Either I'm actually crazy, or
something's coming after me,

310
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,354
and if that's
the case, then...

311
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:43,314
Then I have to protect myself.

312
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:48,528
<i>Okay. Put a pair of scissors underneath
your pillow with the two points open.</i>

313
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,363
Why?

314
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:53,616
Something my grandmother used to do,
she said it keeps evil spirits away.

315
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,992
<i>You're a freak, Romy.</i>

316
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:58,413
<i>Yes, but isn't that
why you love me?</i>

317
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:00,289
Yeah, I guess so.

318
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:02,208
Good night.

319
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,668
<i>Good night, hooker.</i>

320
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,312
Hello?

321
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,648
<i>I need
to speak with you.</i>

322
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:49,982
Sofi?

323
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:55,196
<i>I'm sorry for what happened before, but
there are things you need to know.</i>

324
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,031
<i>You must come.</i>

325
00:35:58,491 --> 00:35:59,700
It's after midnight.

326
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:01,619
<i>This can't wait.</i>

327
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,497
<i>I lied about
knowing your mother.</i>

328
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,500
<i>She did come to see me,
just before she died.</i>

329
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:11,254
Oh, my God. You're the woman
she was talking about.

330
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,089
You're her mother.
Yes.

331
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,431
Why did you
lie to me earlier?

332
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:27,353
I'm sorry,
I was just so startled.

333
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:29,939
Your mother never
told me you were a twin.

334
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,859
But when I saw
your eyes today, I knew.

335
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:39,198
The boy in that reflection,
that was your great uncle.

336
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:42,869
My twin brother, Barto.

337
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:47,373
He died in 1944, when we
were together in Auschwitz.

338
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:56,549
<i>We were taken to see
the doctor in charge.</i>

339
00:36:56,632 --> 00:37:00,303
<i>A man who was
obsessed with twins.</i>

340
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:12,815
<i>He was very handsome.
Very polite.</i>

341
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:17,028
<i>We thought
we'd been rescued.</i>

342
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:31,167
<i>The Nazis believed that twins could
unravel the mysteries of genetics.</i>

343
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:41,510
<i>They conducted
experiments on us.</i>

344
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:49,810
<i>Horrible experiments that blurred the
line between science and occult.</i>

345
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:54,231
<i>One of their obsessions
was eye color.</i>

346
00:37:55,274 --> 00:38:00,571
<i>By trial and error, they attempted
to fabricate blue eyes from brown.</i>

347
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:05,409
<i>The injections
were painful.</i>

348
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:10,706
<i>Some caused blindness.</i>

349
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,585
<i>Some caused death.</i>

350
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:39,777
Two days later,
he came back, except...

351
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,657
It wasn't really Barto.

352
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:48,077
A doorway had been opened.

353
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:52,123
Something else was
inhabiting his body.

354
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,293
Something else?

355
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:01,632
Have you ever
heard of a dybbuk?

356
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:03,592
Mmm-mmm.

357
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:08,806
It is the soul of a dead person that
has been barred from entering heaven.

358
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:15,187
So it endlessly wanders the
borderlands between the worlds,

359
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:18,024
trying to find a new body.

360
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:20,651
Some people are doorways.

361
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:25,072
Yes. Especially twins.

362
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:29,285
Because what is a twin
but another kind of mirror?

363
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:33,122
And mirrors have always been
doorways to the other world.

364
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:40,254
What happened
to your brother?

365
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:45,676
From the moment he came back,
I knew it wasn't Barto.

366
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:50,973
<i>A dybbuk had crossed over
and taken his place.</i>

367
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:56,353
<i>It had used his body
to enter our world.</i>

368
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,609
<i>I killed it</i>

369
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:07,323
It's been trying to find
its way back ever since.

370
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:14,163
Casey. The dybbuk's blood
is on our hands now.

371
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:20,503
This thing, this entity, it tried
to take hold of your unborn twin!

372
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:26,634
And when it couldn't have him, it
turned its gaze to the other child.

373
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:29,136
Me.

374
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:38,604
It's been circling you ever
since you were born, Casey.

375
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:46,612
<i>Why now?</i>

376
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,782
Why didn't this start
happening before?

377
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:54,120
It takes time for it to make
its way from the other side.

378
00:40:54,203 --> 00:41:00,334
It enters our world in stages.
Always it inhabits the helpless creatures first,

379
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:06,298
from insect to animal, slowly making
its way up the ladder of life forms.

380
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:09,343
But a twin is what
it most desires.

381
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:11,220
How do I stop it?

382
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:14,140
Your mother asked
the same question.

383
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:18,519
I told her about the <i>Sefer</i>
ha-marot, the Book of Mirrors,

384
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:21,564
which includes
the rites of exorcisms.

385
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:25,359
There is a rabbi who may
be able to help you.

386
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:28,904
<i>Joseph Sendak. Find him.</i>

387
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:06,692
Please exercise care when
handling the manuscript.

388
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:07,776
Thank you.

389
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,817
I guess
most of you know me.

390
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:50,653
Each day is a struggle,
you know?

391
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:57,785
I keep trying to do
that searching thing.

392
00:42:57,868 --> 00:43:00,162
Make a moral
inventory of myself.

393
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:03,332
Be fearless.

394
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:05,042
Well, that's all we can ask.

395
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:08,087
Thank you for sharing, Rick.

396
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,256
All right, it looks like we're
about finished for the day.

397
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:13,008
We'll pick up where
we left off next week.

398
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:16,428
If I'm not mistaken, Henry's
up to bat on donut duty.

399
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:17,763
Go easy on us,
will you, Henry?

400
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:19,932
Throw in a few
low-fat muffins.

401
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:28,440
Excuse me,
are you Rabbi Sendak?

402
00:43:28,524 --> 00:43:29,525
Yes.

403
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:31,610
Can you read this?

404
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:48,210
Well, the right hand text is Hebrew, so I can.
It's from the Kabbalah.

405
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,755
Jewish mysticism.

406
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:56,260
How did you come by this?

407
00:43:57,511 --> 00:44:02,433
Look. I know that this is gonna
sound crazy, believe me.

408
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:08,814
But l need an exorcism performed.

409
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:15,112
I'm being haunted
by something. I've...

410
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:17,448
A dyb... A dyb...
A dybbuk.

411
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:19,658
Yes. A dybbuk. Yes.

412
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:26,665
Well, as for dybbuks, there really
is no such thing, Miss Beldon.

413
00:44:26,749 --> 00:44:29,335
At least, not outside
the realms of folklore.

414
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:33,839
You have to understand,
back in the Middle Ages,

415
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:37,926
things like spirits and demons
were really just a catchall

416
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:42,056
for conditions people weren't
capable of properly diagnosing.

417
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:44,475
Mental illness, as we know
it, didn't exist back then.

418
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:46,477
I'm not mentally ill, okay?

419
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,395
What's happening
to me is real.

420
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:53,025
Even assuming it is, what you're
asking is beyond my expertise.

421
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:56,028
I've never performed
an exorcism before,

422
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,529
I wouldn't even
know where to begin.

423
00:44:57,613 --> 00:45:02,117
Well, you could read the book.
It would tell you what to do.

424
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:03,786
And then what?

425
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,830
For a religious ceremony
to be effective,

426
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:10,000
the person asking for help
has to actually believe

427
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:12,961
in the spiritual aid
they're calling upon.

428
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:17,049
And I'm guessing
you don't believe.

429
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:23,639
Look.

430
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:30,896
Maybe I could do a little research.
I could make some calls.

431
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:32,648
Okay.

432
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,277
What about your book?

433
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:39,405
Can you translate it for me?

434
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:44,827
Listen.
My life depends on this.

435
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:50,332
So please. Please help me.

436
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:03,971
<i>Take this.</i>

437
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:09,435
It is the hand of Miriam.
It may offer some protection.

438
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:13,439
Stay away from mirrors.

439
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:16,859
<i>If you have any in your home
you must destroy them.</i>

440
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:27,035
<i>Burn the pieces of broken mirror
and then bury what remains.</i>

441
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:35,836
<i>Bells, wind chimes, these are
signs that the spirit is near.</i>

442
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:43,177
<i>You must be vigilant, Casey.</i>

443
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,846
It will seek to isolate you.

444
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:48,307
<i>To weaken your resolve.</i>

445
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:54,980
Can it be killed?

446
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:57,983
<i>It's already dead.</i>

447
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:03,155
<i>The best you can hope for
is to drive it back again.</i>

448
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:10,829
<i>There's no use in trying
to understand it, Casey.</i>

449
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,082
<i>It's not human any more.</i>

450
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:18,670
<i>It is an outsider now.</i>

451
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:23,759
<i>It is no longer
of this universe.</i>

452
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:28,407
Oh, shit.

453
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:32,494
Oh, my God.

454
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:43,880
Oh, my God.
Sweetie, are you okay?

455
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:45,924
He doesn't want
you to help her.

456
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:50,971
If you try to help her,
he'll kill you.

457
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:56,310
Fuck off, you little shit.

458
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:14,244
Oh, my God, Casey, I hit that kid
from across the street with my car,

459
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:17,748
but then he was okay.
I don't know. I don't know.

460
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:20,876
Something is seriously
wrong with that kid.

461
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:23,545
Case, your eyes
are getting worse.

462
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:26,214
I know.

463
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,890
Case? Dude, what's going on?

464
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:40,145
You haven't been to class, you're
not returning my phone calls.

465
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,066
What happened to the mirror?

466
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:45,400
I broke it.

467
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:48,987
Why?

468
00:49:51,323 --> 00:49:53,367
Because Sofi told me to.

469
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,035
Case, that hag from the
old people's home?

470
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:57,371
She's my grandmother, Romy.

471
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,081
What?

472
00:49:59,915 --> 00:50:02,292
She told me the truth
about everything.

473
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:04,670
My God.

474
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:10,425
It's real. Everything that
has been happening is real.

475
00:50:11,218 --> 00:50:14,388
It's some kind of ghost
or demon or something.

476
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:18,975
And it tried to take over my brother,
and that's why my mother went crazy.

477
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,771
She knew that it would
eventually come after me.

478
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,565
It wants to be reborn
into this world.

479
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:26,692
Case...

480
00:50:26,775 --> 00:50:28,860
Listen to me, right now.

481
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:31,863
You have to stay
away from me.

482
00:50:32,531 --> 00:50:33,532
What?

483
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:35,951
It is not safe to be
around me any more.

484
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:43,500
No, no, no. I am your
best friend, okay?

485
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:48,130
And I am not gonna
just abandon you.

486
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:51,633
Okay? It's okay.

487
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:25,310
Mom?

488
00:53:05,976 --> 00:53:09,479
I am thankful to you,
Eternal King,

489
00:53:09,563 --> 00:53:13,483
who has mercifully
returned my soul within me.

490
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:16,194
Your faithfulness is great.
Amen.

491
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:08,830
Eli?

492
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,526
Eli?

493
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,423
Eli?

494
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,178
Miss Beldon?

495
00:57:13,014 --> 00:57:16,184
Miss Beldon,
Sofi wanted you to have this.

496
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:18,728
In case anything happened.

497
00:57:18,812 --> 00:57:19,813
Thank you.

498
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:32,158
<i>Dear Casey,</i>

499
00:57:32,242 --> 00:57:36,913
<i>it has fallen upon you to finish
what began in Auschwitz.</i>

500
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:42,877
<i>Be careful.
The dybbuk feeds on fear.</i>

501
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:47,465
<i>It has a taste for our
family's blood now.</i>

502
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:50,885
<i>And it won't rest until
it's had its revenge.</i>

503
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:55,306
<i>I tried to stop it,
and your mother did as well,</i>

504
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,935
<i>but she lost the battle.
She gave in to her fear.</i>

505
00:58:00,103 --> 00:58:04,149
<i>Whatever happens, don't let it
turn you against yourself.</i>

506
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,153
<i>It will seek to isolate you</i>

507
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:12,073
<i>by attacking your friends,
your family.</i>

508
00:58:12,157 --> 00:58:15,326
<i>But it is you
that it most desires.</i>

509
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:25,290
Get out of here! Go!

510
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:52,859
Maybe it's not
even really after you.

511
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:54,777
<i>It killed my mother.</i>

512
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:56,404
You don't know that.

513
01:00:56,487 --> 01:01:00,074
<i>Yes, I do. And now,
it's killed Sofi, too.</i>

514
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:03,578
It's gonna take everybody
that I love away from me.

515
01:01:04,162 --> 01:01:06,497
That's what it does.
It's gonna wear me down,

516
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:08,833
and then, when I don't have
any strength left to fight it,

517
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,752
that's when it's
gonna come for me.

518
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:13,171
I don't know,
maybe you should leave town.

519
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:14,881
<i>No, no, it wouldn't help.</i>

520
01:01:15,548 --> 01:01:18,801
It's gonna follow me wherever I go.
It's gonna kill me, Romy.

521
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:24,140
Hold on for a second, dude,
someone's at my door.

522
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:26,059
No, no, no.
Don't answer that.

523
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:51,918
<i>Casey?</i>
Mark!

524
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:53,586
Meet me at Remy's house.
Something's wrong.

525
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,630
<i>What? What are you...
Do it! Go!</i>

526
01:02:30,206 --> 01:02:31,833
The doorway is open.

527
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:32,917
What?

528
01:02:51,686 --> 01:02:52,979
Romy!

529
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:54,147
What? What?

530
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,523
She's not answering the door.

531
01:02:59,694 --> 01:03:02,071
Go back! Around back!
Come on, come on, come on!

532
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:04,073
No!

533
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:09,704
I told you not to help her.

534
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,622
Please. Please.

535
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:24,802
All right, let's go.
Here, come on.

536
01:03:26,596 --> 01:03:27,722
Romy!

537
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:35,521
No! Mark, stop! Stop!

538
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:41,444
It's not in him any more.

539
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:51,078
Get Matty.
Get Matty, let's go.

540
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:54,749
Let's go! Move!

541
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,501
Shit!

542
01:04:19,607 --> 01:04:22,443
It's my fault.
It killed her because of me.

543
01:04:23,194 --> 01:04:24,654
Where did it come from?

544
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:25,947
I don't know.

545
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:30,576
It's not like us. I don't even think
that it comes from the same universe.

546
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,994
But you can sense
when it's near?

547
01:04:32,078 --> 01:04:33,371
Yes.

548
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:37,458
It's getting stronger, Mark.
And I can feel it everywhere.

549
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:40,461
And I think that it's strong
enough to enter anyone now.

550
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:42,004
Even the dead.

551
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:52,557
So no place is safe.

552
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,891
No.

553
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:57,019
No, see, I don't think that
the world was ever safe.

554
01:04:57,103 --> 01:05:02,358
I think that we were always just
trying to pretend like it was,

555
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:03,943
but it's not.

556
01:05:21,419 --> 01:05:23,546
I like that. That's good.
That's what I need to see.

557
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:25,131
Why did you
change your mind?

558
01:05:25,214 --> 01:05:27,883
You know, I can't say that I truly
believe in what's afflicting you,

559
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:30,344
but I think you believe.

560
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,765
And if you're convinced
an exorcism is what you need,

561
01:05:34,849 --> 01:05:36,601
then who am I
to turn you away?

562
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:40,271
If you'd seen what I saw last night, you
wouldn't have any problem believing.

563
01:05:41,606 --> 01:05:43,774
So, why are we meeting here?

564
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:45,359
Because we need backup.

565
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,280
I may be a man of God,
but I'm not a miracle worker.

566
01:05:54,035 --> 01:05:55,870
Good to see you, Joe.

567
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:58,039
This is Casey.
Hey, nice to meet you.

568
01:05:58,122 --> 01:05:59,582
Mark.
Hey, Mark.

569
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:01,459
And this is Arthur Wyndham.

570
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:05,129
He is an Episcopal priest and a
very, very dear friend of mine.

571
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:07,006
So you've done exorcisms?

572
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:11,594
No, I studied the phenomenon, I did my
dissertation on it back in college.

573
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:15,389
Just wait a second. I'm not looking
for a Christian exorcism here.

574
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:16,891
Fair enough.

575
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:20,895
But there are certain elements
to these kind of rites that are

576
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:22,647
pretty common to
virtually all religions,

577
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:26,108
and it's these elements
that I'm familiar with.

578
01:06:27,276 --> 01:06:31,614
You gotta understand,
this thing that's after you,

579
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:36,369
if it exists, it predates religion.
It probably predates mankind.

580
01:06:36,452 --> 01:06:38,204
It's not as if there's
one kind of demon

581
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:40,581
that is vulnerable
to Jewish prayer,

582
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:42,958
or another that's allergic
to Christian or Muslim.

583
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,085
It doesn't actually
work that way.

584
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,504
So the words in that book,
they can't help me.

585
01:06:46,587 --> 01:06:52,093
No, no, no. On the contrary, I think that it
can, but not in a way that you might think.

586
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:55,346
Now you, you may not believe,

587
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:59,016
but your mother
and your grandmother did.

588
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:06,190
And it's because of their belief that
these words give us the best shot

589
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:08,192
at driving this thing out.

590
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:09,485
I've translated
what's in the book,

591
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,028
so I'll be leading
the invocation

592
01:07:11,112 --> 01:07:13,698
and Arthur and a few others
will be assisting us.

593
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:15,658
Yeah. Yeah, but
before we get started,

594
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:20,663
there's a few formalities that
we have to get out of the way.

595
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,873
Can I see your IDs, please?

596
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:27,628
I gotta verify that you're of
legal age to consent to this.

597
01:07:27,712 --> 01:07:29,505
All right.
You kidding?

598
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:30,673
No.
No?

599
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:33,092
Not kidding. These
are the forms, actually.

600
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:35,428
I don't know
if they're legally binding,

601
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:40,808
but we're in murky waters here, just
in case something does go wrong.

602
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:43,811
Thank you.
Thank you.

603
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:49,066
Great. So when do we do this?
Tomorrow night. Sabbath.

604
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:50,151
At your Synagogue?

605
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:51,652
Oh, no, no, no.

606
01:07:51,736 --> 01:07:56,532
Given how unorthodox this all is,
I think we'll find another venue.

607
01:07:56,615 --> 01:08:01,287
Yeah, yeah. ls there somewhere that
is particularly negative to you?

608
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:04,081
Somewhere that you may have
incurred a lot of pain?

609
01:08:45,498 --> 01:08:47,541
Hell of a place to get
religious, Sendak.

610
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:48,793
Cheery, isn't it?

611
01:08:50,336 --> 01:08:53,923
This is Rick Hesse,
he's an EMT.

612
01:08:54,006 --> 01:08:56,634
I thought it would be a good idea
to have him here, just in case.

613
01:08:56,717 --> 01:08:57,676
Nice to meet you.

614
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,053
As for the other volunteers,

615
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:03,182
they've all been through some kind of
hardship and they're willing to help.

616
01:09:03,265 --> 01:09:06,393
Now, typically, a Jewish exorcism
rite involves 10 people.

617
01:09:06,477 --> 01:09:07,686
Why 10?

618
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,064
10 fingers, 10 commandments.

619
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:14,610
10 is also the number of the Sephiroth,
which are the known attributes of God.

620
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:16,487
The idea is that these 10

621
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:19,323
form a protective circle
around the afflicted person.

622
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:23,786
Yeah, once we get going, Casey will
stand in the middle of the circle,

623
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:26,413
Sendak will read the
original text in Hebrew,

624
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:29,750
and the rest of you will follow me in
English, call and response format.

625
01:09:29,834 --> 01:09:33,879
Now the heart of the
ceremony is Psalm 91.

626
01:09:33,963 --> 01:09:36,590
<i>Yoshev B'seter,
the Psalm of Protection.</i>

627
01:09:36,674 --> 01:09:40,386
At the beginning and the end of the
invocation, I'll sound the shofar,

628
01:09:40,469 --> 01:09:43,597
which is an animal horn
used in religious ceremonies.

629
01:09:43,681 --> 01:09:48,936
In this case, the sound is intended to
shock the spirit hiding within the victim.

630
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:52,690
Once the spirit is more compliant,
then we can start drawing it out.

631
01:09:52,773 --> 01:09:54,608
That's when the rest of us
are the most vulnerable.

632
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:59,405
It wants Casey, but it will
take any port in the storm.

633
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:02,867
And remember, no matter what
happens, once we've begun,

634
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:06,412
the exorcism must be finished.
Any questions?

635
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:09,456
Yeah, why are they
bringing in a gurney?

636
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:15,170
The gurney is for Casey's
protection as well as ours.

637
01:10:16,088 --> 01:10:21,010
Sometimes people thrash out,
just a precaution. That's all.

638
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:25,931
All right then.
Let's get started.

639
01:10:42,281 --> 01:10:44,742
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

640
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:46,327
I just want this to be over.

641
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:50,247
My name is Arthur Wyndham,
and this is the video record

642
01:10:50,331 --> 01:10:54,585
of the attempted exorcism
of Casey Beldon.

643
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:59,924
We have the permission of the ecclesiastical
authority who are praying for us.

644
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:05,846
Everyone participating tonight is here
of their own free will, including Casey.

645
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,890
Agreed?
Yes.

646
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:08,933
Just for the camera.

647
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:11,018
Yes, this is what I want.

648
01:11:12,227 --> 01:11:14,563
Now, if...
And this is a big if.

649
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:18,108
But assuming a spirit actually
manifests itself on your person,

650
01:11:18,192 --> 01:11:22,821
it may take the shape of a kind
of bulge beneath the flesh.

651
01:11:22,905 --> 01:11:24,239
Now try not to be
alarmed by this.

652
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:26,367
Even though we're dealing
with a spiritual phenomenon,

653
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:29,119
the entity still needs to be housed
in some degree of physical mass.

654
01:11:29,203 --> 01:11:33,499
So if your body produces a reaction like
that, it means what we're doing is working.

655
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:34,750
I understand.

656
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:35,834
All right.

657
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:39,338
Okay, so we're gonna place
this block in your mouth,

658
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:42,132
so you don't bite
on your tongue.

659
01:11:42,216 --> 01:11:43,759
Let's just get on with this.

660
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:45,469
Okay.

661
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:16,208
The circle is now
made whole and sacred.

662
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:37,187
"In the name of Adonai,
God of Israel.

663
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:41,567
"May Michael be by my right,
Gabriel at my left,

664
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:45,779
"Uriel before me,
Raphael behind me.

665
01:12:45,863 --> 01:12:48,949
"Beneath my feet
the ground of God."

666
01:12:59,293 --> 01:13:04,506
"I say to you of the Lord who
is my refuge and my stronghold,

667
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:07,009
"my God in whom I trust,

668
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:10,220
"that he will save you
from the fowler's snare

669
01:13:10,304 --> 01:13:12,681
"and destructive pestilence."

670
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:28,322
"He will cover you with his feathers
and you will find refuge under his wings.

671
01:13:29,114 --> 01:13:31,658
"His truth will be
your shield and armor."

672
01:13:41,502 --> 01:13:42,961
Keep going.

673
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:47,341
Don't stop reading.

674
01:13:49,343 --> 01:13:54,932
"You will not fear the terror of the
night nor the arrow that flies by day."

675
01:14:30,217 --> 01:14:31,885
<i>The doorway is open.</i>

676
01:15:29,943 --> 01:15:32,196
Get me
out of here! Come on!

677
01:15:33,614 --> 01:15:36,116
Get me out of here!
Get me out! Come on!

678
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,201
Let's go, let's go.

679
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:45,751
No, no, no, wait. The page.

680
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:46,877
What?
Forget it! Let's go!

681
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,253
We have to finish it.

682
01:15:48,337 --> 01:15:49,463
Come on!

683
01:16:43,475 --> 01:16:46,520
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I think he's gone.

684
01:16:53,735 --> 01:16:54,861
No!

685
01:17:03,704 --> 01:17:04,788
No!

686
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:41,658
Baby, we gotta go.
Get up, baby. Come on. God.

687
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:47,247
Baby. Baby, you're hurting me.
Mark, stop it.

688
01:18:27,162 --> 01:18:28,163
Mark!

689
01:18:49,309 --> 01:18:50,894
"...ten thousand
at your right,

690
01:18:50,977 --> 01:18:52,979
"but it will
not come near you.

691
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:57,484
"No evil will befall you, no plague
will come near thy dwelling."

692
01:18:59,194 --> 01:19:02,072
"For he will command
his angels in your behalf,

693

"to guide you

694

696
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:12,082

01:19:27,055 --> 01:19:28,849
"I satisfy him..."

702
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:57,794
Casey.

703
01:19:59,546 --> 01:20:00,547
Yeah.

704
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:03,884
Did you stop him?

705
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:05,427
I think so.

706
01:20:09,764 --> 01:20:10,765
Hey.

707
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,769
Am I gonna keep
falling forever?

708
01:20:47,469 --> 01:20:48,470
<i>Why now?</i>

709
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:51,264
Why didn't this start
happening before?

710
01:21:03,318 --> 01:21:06,530
<i>A little hormonal maybe,
but you're not crazy.</i>

711
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:22,337
And it looks like double
congratulations are in order.

712
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:26,925
You're carrying twins.

713
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,137
Jumby wants to be born now.
