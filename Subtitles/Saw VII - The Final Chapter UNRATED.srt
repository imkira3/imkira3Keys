<i>Hello, Mr. Hindle,</i>

2
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:39,329
<i>or as they called you</i>
<i>around the hospital, Zepp.</i>

3
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,842
Game over!

4
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,830
Check it, man.

5
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,351
What the fuck is this?

6
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,921
What the fuck are you doing here?

7
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:17,893
What the fuck are you doing here?

8
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,227
I'm fucking stuck.

9
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,967
Yeah, me too.

10
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,627
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

11
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,032
Somebody, help us.

12
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,303
- Hello.
- Come on, help us!

13
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,306
Oh, my God!

14
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,750
Dina.

15
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,874
Brad.

16
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,945
- Ryan?
- Baby, are you okay?

17
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,218
- Get me out of here!
- Baby.

18
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,793
Help us. Somebody help us!

19
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,653
Hey! Call the police!

20
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,355
Hey, break the glass with your case.

21
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,626
Break the fucking glass! Do it.

22
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,258
Stay back!

23
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,234
Do it!

24
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,299
- Get me out of here.
- Break it!

25
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,169
<i>Hello, Brad.</i>

26
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,543
<i>Hello, Ryan. I'd like to play a game.</i>

27
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,711
<i>The same woman</i>
<i>has played each of you for a fool,</i>

28
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,953
<i>manipulating your love for her,</i>
<i>and causing nothing but pain.</i>

29
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,124
<i>Her fun and games pushed you both</i>
<i>to break the law to fulfill her material needs.</i>

30
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,759
<i>She is toxic,</i>

31
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,865
<i>and today all of your transgressions</i>
<i>will be made public.</i>

32
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,497
He's fucking lying, Brad.

33
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,601
<i>Now you must choose who</i>
<i>will drop out of this triangle,</i>

34
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:43,011
<i>for within 60 seconds one of you must die.</i>

35
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,583
<i>If you wish to save her,</i>
<i>then the saws must be pushed</i>

36
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,485
<i>all the way to one side or the other,</i>

37
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,391
<i>sparing her while proving for good</i>
<i>who is indeed the alpha male.</i>

38
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,089
What are you fucking staring at,
you motherfuckers?

39
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,392
- Do something!
<i>- Are you both strong enough</i>

40
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,230
<i>to walk away from what is destroying you,</i>

41
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:07,102
<i>or will you fight one more time</i>
<i>for the heart that binds?</i>

42
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,068
<i>You have 60 seconds to decide.</i>

43
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,910
<i>Live or die. Make your choice.</i>

44
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,949
Oh, fuck!

45
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,216
One of you save me!

46
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,601
What the fuck are you doing?

47
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,398
It's me or you asshole,
and it sure as shit isn't gonna be me.

48
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,710
Brad. Brad.

49
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,947
Brad, I love you.

50
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,383
I love you too, baby.

51
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,588
Do it. You gotta do it.

52
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,523
- What?
- You gotta kill him, Brad.

53
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,723
- Do it!
- Stupid bitch!

54
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,264
Do it. Do it! Do it!

55
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,977
Fuck!

56
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,206
You love him?

57
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,743
No, no.

58
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,284
You love him more than me?

59
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,586
No, I had to say that.

60
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,649
I've always loved you.

61
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,289
You got to do it for me, please.

62
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,217
You got to kill him. Kill Brad! Do it!

63
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,760
You lying slut!

64
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,263
What the fuck are you doing?

65
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,459
You don't love anybody!

66
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,901
You're a cheat and a liar. Fuck you!

67
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,233
Fuck you!

68
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,171
Brad! Brad, look at me!

69
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,637
Is the chick that fucked me in your bed
two days ago worth one of our lives?

70
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,212
She's not worth it, man. She's not worth it.

71
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,017
Right?

72
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,178
Yeah!

73
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,656
What are you doing, you fucking asshole?

74
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,982
I think we're breaking up with you, Dina.

75
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,992
No! No, stop!

76
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,039
- Stand aside!
- Move it!

77
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,908
People, get out of the way.

78
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,367
Somebody help her.

79
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,630
Game over.

80
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,131
No! No, you fucking bitch!

81
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:22,790
No!

82
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,005
<i>Tonight, a house of horrors</i>
<i>has been discovered</i>

83
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,439
<i>at what used to be known</i>
<i>as the Rowan Zoological Institute.</i>

84
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,877
<i>The body of Umbrella Health CEO</i>

<i>Hopefully the many questions</i>

<i>to walk away from</i>
<i>this unprecedented display</i>

92

<i>of carnage with their lives.</i>

93
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:41,173
<i>We now go live to Tony Gabrielson</i>
<i>who is reporting from the scene. Tony.</i>

94
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,104
- Hey, man.
- Hey, what's up?

95
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,085
- What have we got here?
- That's Jill Tuck, Jigsaw's widow.

96
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,312
What does she want?

97
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,286
All she said was that
she didn't trust the FBI,

98
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,288
- and she didn't trust homicide.
- Good.

99
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,152
And she just wants to talk to you.

100
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,225
- Why me?
- I don't know. Only you, though.

101
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,494
She looks crazier than a sack full of cats.

102
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,042
All right, let's get this over with.

103
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,508
Hey. I put cream and sugar in it.

104
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,353
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

105
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,889
I'm Matt Gibson, internal affairs.

106
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,391
My colleague said that you
wanted to speak with me.

107
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,517
Yes.

108
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,922
But I need complete immunity.

109
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,992
Why do you want immunity, Miss Tuck?

110
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,635
Because of what I know.

111
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,773
Which is what?

112
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,939
Do we have a deal?

113
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,747
You've got to give before you can receive
in this house, Jill.

114
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,643
My husband John, he had an accomplice.

115
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,354
A person who assisted him
with almost every murder.

116
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,858
Look, don't get me wrong.

117
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,021
I'm all ears if you've got something legit
that you want to put on the table.

118
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,529
This person will go on killing
until he's stopped.

119
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,728
- You know him and he definitely knows you.
- Is that right?

120
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,534
He's detective Mark Hoffman.

121
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,309
Are you willing to sign a sworn affidavit?

122
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,104
Yes.

123
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,910
You swear to be totally open?

124
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,780
You tell me everything,
no matter how personal or private?

125
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:34,910
Yes.

126
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,116
I'll give you evidence, whatever you want,

127
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,959
as long as I have your protection,
and complete immunity.

128
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,354
Do we have a deal?

129
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,830
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we have a deal.

130
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,162
<i>Welcome back!</i>

131
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,333
We're live with Bobby Dagen
whose national tour

132
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,240
<i>S.U.R. V.I. V.E.</i>
<i>My Story of Overcoming Jigsaw</i>

133
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,438
rolls into town this weekend.

134
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,812
Well, you're quite the national phenomenon
these days, aren't you?

135
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,316
Well, thank you, ma'am.

136
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,253
It's quite flattering how many people
have responded to my story.

137
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:49,384
And if I can help a few people along the way,
then I'm pleased.

138
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,864
Now, you survived a trap created
by the infamous Jigsaw killer, correct?

139
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,233
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,826
Well, everyone must ask you this question.
What was that like?

141
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,799
Life changing.

142
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,069
It was something I never anticipated

143
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,771
and, quite honestly, something
that should have killed me.

144
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,509
Tell me more.
Tell me about the actual experience.

145
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,552
I actually have no recollection
of how I got there.

146
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,247
I just remember the feeling

147
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,654
of waking up trapped.

148
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:24,553
And I had to insert two hooks
into my pectoral muscles

149
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,153
and hoist myself up to a platform.

150
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,562
You put the hooks in yourself?

151
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,167
I did.

152
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,571
I pretty much realized
that I couldn't hold on much longer,

153
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:38,373
and I had to accept the fact
that I was going to die.

154
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,672
And then I saw something,

155
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,269
and what I saw was my life.

156
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,646
It was a tragedy. I achieved nothing.

157
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:53,182
And right then,
something inside me started to grow,

158
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,826
something from the bottom of my soul.

159
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,863
And I just... I decided to live.

160
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,833
I found a strength that I thought
had long since expired.

161
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,665
And I just yanked, and I yanked!

162
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,969
And when I got to the top,
I just ripped the hooks out of my chest.

163
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,841
There was blood everywhere,
and I just screamed.

164
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,507
I just sat there and screamed.

165
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,346
Because I hadn't just survived,

166
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,181
I was reborn.

167
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,246
This was my life.

168
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,530
Wow. Bobby Dagen, everyone.

169
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,700
Bobby's life-changing
experience comes to the...

170
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,428
This is the moment.

171
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,065
- Where's the big kiss?
- I don't know.

172
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,639
Tickets are still available.

173
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,631
And we're out, folks.

174
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,339
- That's not the way it's supposed to be.
- You need to relax.

175
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,878
No, we rehearsed it differently.

176
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,216
It's okay. Nice work, Bobby.

177
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,211
Ladies, can you excuse us for a minute?

178
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,089
Where was the big finish, Bobby?

179
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,715
You tell your story,
you thank your pretty wife,

180
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,088
you bring her out for a big hug and kiss.

181
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,752
I just didn't want to push it, all right?

182
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,625
Okay, but that's the heart of the story.

183
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,092
She was there for your whole recovery.

184
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,862
And without the acknowledgment,
without the kiss,

185
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,268
the audience isn't gonna have any kind
of emotional connection.

186
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,339
I disagree.

187
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,237
Too much emotion,
and it's gonna feel like pandering.

188
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,401
Okay, why don't you let me
do the public relations,

189
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,636
and you do the legal paperwork, okay?

190
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,509
Okay, I get it, Suzanne, all right?
It's my fault.

191
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,980
It wasn't your fault, Bobby.

192
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,574
You were fine.

193
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,448
- Just remember your bullet points next time.
- I will.

194
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,851
These interviews are important.

195
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,718
Nina, relax.

196
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,791
Don't worry about them.

197
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,589
You were great.

198
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,921
Yeah?

199
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,996
Your story's real and people feel that.

200
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:43,893
I know that you get overwhelmed at times,
but we have to keep moving forward, Bobby.

201
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,139
You were meant to do this.

202
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,512
I know. I know, baby.

203
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,577
- Bobby.
- Yeah?

204
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,378
We got the Jigsaw survivor group tomorrow.

205
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,282
Thirty minutes of face time
with other survivors.

206
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,378
Yeah, sounds good.

207
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:07,186
- Nothing more exciting than that.
- No, not much. Let's go.

208
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,093
Oh, God!

209
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,037
You want to know the only thing wrong
with killing you, Jill?

210
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,307
I can only do it once.

211
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,319
Oh, my God!

212
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,720
No!

213
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,118
Help me! Help me!

214
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,692
Help! Fuck!

215
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,362
<i>Hello, Evan. I want to play a game.</i>

216
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,098
<i>The situation you find yourself in</i>
<i>is of your own doing.</i>

217
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:05,609
<i>You, your girlfriend,</i>
<i>and your friends are all racists.</i>

218
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,080
Evan, you fuck. You get me out of here!

219
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:13,383
<i>You have intimidated others</i>
<i>based on their physical differences.</i>

220
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,750
<i>But today it is you who will run scared.</i>

221
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,951
<i>Your pathetic friends</i>
<i>follow your every word, Evan.</i>

222
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:27,259
<i>Therefore you will be the only one capable</i>
<i>of saving them and yourself.</i>

223
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:33,429
<i>In 30 seconds,</i>
<i>the jacks holding up this car will fall,</i>

224
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,073
<i>setting off a deadly chain of events.</i>

225
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,304
<i>In order to stop this from happening,</i>

226
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:45,748
<i>you must tear yourself away</i>
<i>from the seat to which you are glued.</i>

227
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:51,187
<i>Then you must pull the red lever before you.</i>
<i>But no act comes without a sacrifice.</i>

228
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,524
<i>You've judged others</i>
<i>by the color of their skin,</i>

229
00:19:54,626 --> 00:20:00,997
<i>and today, Evan, you will learn</i>
<i>that we are all the same color on the inside.</i>

230
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,402
<i>Live or die, Evan, the choice is yours.</i>

231
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,068
No!

232
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,742
- Evan, help!
- I can't.

233
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,547
- Do it. Fuck!
- Fucking do it!

234
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,145
Just fucking do it!

235
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,122
Do it! Do it, man!

236
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,284
Here I go!

237
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,264
Evan!

238
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,233
Baby, get me out of here!

239
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,534
Shit! Fuck! Here I go!

240
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,267
Here I go! Come on!

241
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,603
Fuck me!

242
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,710
Please!

243
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,388
- God!
- Do it! Fucking do it!

244
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,360
- God!
- Do it!

245
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,960
- Evan!
- You got us into this.

246
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,625
Get us the fuck out!

247
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,869
Do it!

248
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,004
You fucking pussy!

249
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,450
Shit.

250
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,886
Every night

251
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:08,153
I keep thinking that things will get better

252
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,087
the next morning when I wake up.

253
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,630
But it isn't.

254
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,330
Everything I do,

255
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,505
everything I see, I'm surrounded by these

256
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,604
tiny triggers.

257
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,442
They're everywhere,

258
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,876
and they remind me of what I went through,

259
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,309
what Jigsaw did to me.

260
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,244
Sidney, go on, please. You're...

261
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,915
You're in a safe place now.

262
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,457
Tell me what happened next.

263
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:45,427
Alex! Stop, please! Stop it!

264
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,744
Sidney, look at me.

265
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,710
You made a decision.

266
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,215
How did that make you feel?

267
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,679
Free.

268
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,420
He was abusive.

269
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,689
I tried to stop it before,

270
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,323
but it wasn't until that moment

271
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,727
that I really did something.

272
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,695
It was him or me, and I chose to live.

273
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,773
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

274
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,544
That's a bunch of bullshit.

275
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,078
He had to die for you to leave him?

276
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,580
You want to know
the best thing that happened to me

277
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,917
after having to cut off my own arm?

278
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,561
It's handicapped parking at the damn mall!

279
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:00,061
What the hell is a camera here for anyway?

280
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,672
I am simply here to illustrate the fact
that a traumatic experience,

281
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,235
such as the kind that each one of us
has been forced to endure,

282
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,077
can have a positive outcome. That's all.

283
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,049
Yeah? Like what?

284
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,946
A new perspective on life. Wait, wait, wait.

285
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,957
I know. I understand
that you're not at that place yet.

286
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,226
I understand that and I respect that.

287
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,925
But if you look around at all these people

288
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,300
taking their lives for granted,

289
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:37,441
eventually they all found something positive
from their experience.

290
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,976
We should never be ashamed
of what we've gone through,

291
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,808
because we are good and we are strong!

292
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:46,882
You know what?

293
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,580
I'd like everybody to have
a look at something right here.

294
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,983
These are my scars.

295
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,561
Because our minds will heal,

296
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,822
but these scars will never go away.

297
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:06,026
These scars should not be
a symbol of shame.

298
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,037
They should be worn as a badge of courage.

299
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,804
You know, earlier,

300
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:16,973
I spoke of valuing your loved ones.

301
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,749
But to be perfectly honest,

302
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,786
it's something that I never did
prior to my ordeal.

303
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,378
But since then,

304
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:29,422
I have found someone
who has truly become my rock.

305
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:33,653
Joyce, if you could...

306
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,133
Please.

307
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,263
It's my lovely wife Joyce.

308
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,475
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

309
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,118
Bravo.

310
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,182
To be able to sustain
such a traumatic experience,

311
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:06,560
and yet find the positive in that grizzly act,

312
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,697
it's a remarkable feat indeed.

313
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,235
Remarkable,

314
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,568
if not a little perverse.

315
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,903
I'm sure I speak for everyone
here when I say

316
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,505
how grateful we are

317
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:31,121
to be part of your promotional DVD.

318
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,925
I appreciate it. Thank you. It's...

319
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,407
- I can take that, sir.
- Thank you very much.

320
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,238
Joyce, can I borrow him for a second?

321
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,641
Sure. I'll be in the car, okay?

322
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,905
Two minutes behind you.

323
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,241
- Great.
- You'll see her to the car, please, sir?

324
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,145
- Of course.
- Thank you.

325
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,644
What's up?

326
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,243
So what's with the creepy guy with the
cane? Someone I should know about?

327
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,346
No, no, no. He's been at these meetings
longer than I have.

328
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,617
He's fine.

329
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:08,984
All right.

330
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,694
Listen, get back to the hotel,
and get some rest, all right?

331
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,787
Yeah. Everything's fine.

332
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,524
Great work tonight, Bobby.

333
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,329
- Thank you.
- You're the man.

334
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,609
Joyce?

335
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,321
What happened to him?

336
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,094
They always tell you not to smoke
at the gas station.

337
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,994
- This should wrap up the week for you.
- Great.

338
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:54,705
What's up, man?

339
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,508
I'm at a junkyard on 58th.

340
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:58,800
Why?

341
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,434
<i>Call came in about a car crash.</i>

342
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,638
<i>Car crash? Why are you there?</i>

343
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,541
It's not just a car crash.

344
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:05,911
It's a trap.

345
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,575
How many bodies?

346
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,843
<i>Enough pieces to make four.</i>

347
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,947
Okay, get everyone away
from that crime scene till I get there.

348
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,855
<i>- Even Homicide, you got it?</i>
- Yeah.

349
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,426
All right, I'm on the way.

350
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:22,062
<i>Hello, Evan. I want to play a game.</i>

351
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,692
<i>The situation you find yourself in...</i>

352
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,532
<i>You, your girlfriend...</i>

353
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:37,105
<i>You have intimidated others</i>
<i>based on their physical differences.</i>

354
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,530
So, what do you think?

355
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,226
Why?

356
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,531
Why this display?

357
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,131
Why them? Why now?

358
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,735
You know he likes to put on a show.

359
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,743
Well, there's gotta be something else.

360
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,622
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

361
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,954
We'll need them checked
for anything resembling a clue.

362
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,120
Tattoos, piercings, skin cuttings.

363
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,393
If that man has a cavity in his tooth,
I want to know about it.

364
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,728
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

365
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,028
Gibson.

366
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,936
Yeah?

367
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,965
Hoffman was expecting you.

368
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:39,742
God damn.

369
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,772
Would you look at that?

370
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,617
Please get forensics in here.

371
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,746
Tell them to haul ass.

372
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,113
This needs to be dusted for prints.

373
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,421
- All right.
- Okay.

374
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,050
Help!

375
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:48,601
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>

376
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,643
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

377
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:56,246
<i>You have amassed wealth, fame,</i>
<i>and notoriety,</i>

378
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,152
<i>based upon your story of survival.</i>

379
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:04,058
<i>Many have aided in your cause,</i>
<i>but few know the truth.</i>

380
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,221
<i>You are a liar.</i>

381
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,129
<i>You and I both know</i>
<i>you have never been in a trap,</i>

382
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,600
<i>nor have you ever been tested.</i>

383
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:17,369
<i>Today these lies will come full circle</i>
<i>and you will learn</i>

384
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:22,404
<i>if you truly have what it takes</i>
<i>to call yourself a survivor.</i>

385
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,245
<i>The cage you find yourself in</i>

386
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,409
<i>will symbolize your rebirth.</i>

387
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,586
Joyce? No!

388
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,853
Joyce! No!

389
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,291
Please, no.

390
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,757
<i>Within the next 60 minutes,</i>

391
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,890
<i>you must stay upon the path of learning</i>

392
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,469
<i>and traverse a series of obstacles</i>

393
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,697
<i>to obtain access to your wife,</i>

394
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,739
<i>who you have also deceived.</i>

395
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,909
<i>If you fail to reach her</i>
<i>before the clock runs out,</i>

396
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,743
<i>- she will die.</i>
- No.

397
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,410
<i>Live or die, Bobby?</i>

398
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:57,879
<i>Make your choice.</i>

399
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,582
Bobby!

400
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,755
Help!

401
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,860
Help!

402
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,195
Let me out!

403
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,401
Bobby.

404
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,742
Bobby! What's going on? What's going on?

405
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,109
<i>Another Jigsaw survivor has come forward.</i>

406
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,747
<i>As the city stays crippled in fear</i>
<i>from the Jigsaw killings,</i>

407
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:47,485
<i>chilling new words from</i>
<i>the latest survivor provide a reminder</i>

408
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:51,119
<i>of the physical and mental toll</i>
<i>these deadly games can take.</i>

409
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,826
<i>This horrible event was happening to me,</i>

410
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,101
<i>and in that moment,</i>

411
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,297
<i>that moment that this thing</i>

412
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,373
<i>threatened to take everything away,</i>

413
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,535
<i>even the pain,</i>

414
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,908
<i>I realized what I still had left to give.</i>

415
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,976
<i>And I didn't want to let that go.</i>

416
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,681
<i>It gave me light.</i>

417
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:25,589
<i>That pure moment</i>
<i>of absolute horror gave me light.</i>

418
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,028
<i>And as wrong as this may seem,</i>

419
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,358
<i>I'm better for enduring it.</i>

420
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,164
<i>I'm stronger.</i>

421
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,432
<i>And, I must admit, I'm grateful for it.</i>

422
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,671
<i>I'm grateful it happened to me,</i>

423
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,112
<i>and I wish the same for everyone like me.</i>

424
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,381
<i>Joan is but one of a growing</i>
<i>number of citizens...</i>

425
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:51,545
If something like that doesn't get you
to change your perspective on life,

426
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:53,950
I don't know what will.

427
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,351
Yeah.

428
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,987
And if those people weren't so fucked up
after their games,

429
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,693
they'd make a mint selling their stories.

430
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,496
That's a real clever design.

431
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,967
Yours or your husband's?

432
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,838
- Everything was him.
- Right.

433
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,170
Well, here's my problem,

434
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:22,804
that was left for me,
and your fingerprints were all over it.

435
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,842
When you told me Hoffman had it in for you,

436
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,748
you didn't mention that
it was because you tried to kill him.

437
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,656
There's a new game going on.

438
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,352
Does that surprise you?

439
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,123
- No.
- No? No?

440
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,561
You're crazy, you know that?

441
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,632
I knew you were crazy
the minute I laid eyes on you.

442
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:46,862
Crazy.

443
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:52,008
Okay, this is what we're gonna do, crazy.

444
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,741
Till I catch Mark Hoffman,
this is your new home.

445
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,514
Get comfy.

446
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,245
What makes you think he can't find me here?

447
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,410
Jill, it's a safe house.

448
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,012
Safe house. Safe. House.

449
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:06,918
You get it?

450
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:14,257
Gibson, this was sent here addressed to Jill.

451
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,994
- Hoffman knows our location.
- God damn it. God damn it!

452
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:19,970
What?

453
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:23,568
We just had a small explosion here in a car
at the crime scene.

454
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:24,766
<i>Okay, is anyone hurt?</i>

455
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,206
Holy shit!

456
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:35,752
Rogers?

457
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,150
<i>Rogers, you okay?</i>

458
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,222
Yeah.

459
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,222
Get out of there.
You get the bomb squad to sweep the yard.

460
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,554
<i>Don't touch anything else until it's clean.</i>

461
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,084
- Got it.
<i>- All right.</i>

462
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:47,690
Play it.

463
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,029
<i>Hello, Gibson.</i>

464
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,370
<i>Been a long time.</i>

465
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,432
<i>What I want is simple,</i>

466
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:00,942
<i>give me Jill Tuck.</i>

467
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,274
<i>You're protecting her despite the fact</i>

468
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,939
<i>that she had direct knowledge throughout,</i>

469
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,950
<i>which makes her complicit in every death.</i>

470
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,512
<i>I'll make you a deal.</i>

471
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,089
<i>Give her to me,</i>

472
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,121
<i>the game stops, and no one else dies.</i>

473
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,787
<i>If not, everyone dies and you'll be to blame.</i>

474
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,866
<i>Make your choice.</i>

475
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,458
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

476
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,407
Let's get her down to the holding cell
at the station.

477
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,376
Lock it down.
No one gets in without my authority.

478
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,637
Got it.

479
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,455
Oh, my God.

480
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:56,955
Oh, God!

481
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,365
No! Please!

482
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,266
No! Please, help! Please!

483
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,939
Please, no!

484
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,338
God damn it!

485
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,402
Bobby. Bobby, help me!

486
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,446
You've got to get me out of here.

487
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,380
I can't move, Bobby.

488
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,012
Please, help me!

489
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,984
Okay, okay, okay. Just relax.

490
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,758
Help me! Do something!

491
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:28,329
Don't leave me.

492
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,429
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>

493
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,663
<i>Before you</i>
<i>is one of your trusted colleagues.</i>

494
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:39,505
<i>She has been your publicist for years,</i>
<i>knowing your lies</i>

495
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,010
<i>but choosing to speak no evil.</i>

496
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:45,105
<i>She has been richly rewarded for her words,</i>

497
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:49,175
<i>but today she will be rewarded</i>
<i>for her silence.</i>

498
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,153
<i>In the X-ray, you will see a key,</i>

499
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:57,057
<i>the key to Nina's survival,</i>
<i>which will shut off her device.</i>

500
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,623
<i>But there's a catch.</i>

501
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,755
<i>You have one minute</i>
<i>to pull the fish hook from her stomach,</i>

502
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,390
<i>and unlock her device</i>

503
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,937
<i>or else the four spikes</i>
<i>will penetrate her throat,</i>

504
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,700
<i>- silencing Nina forever.</i>
- Fuck!

505
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,038
<i>Remember, the spikes will also advance</i>

506
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:18,104
<i>each time the decibel level in this room</i>
<i>rises above a whisper,</i>

507
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,046
<i>killing her even sooner.</i>

508
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:24,249
<i>Will Nina live or die, Bobby?</i>
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

509
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:29,317
- Help me. Help!
- No! No!

510
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,591
Just shut up.

511
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,691
Stay with me, okay?

512
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:44,799
Do it.

513
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,274
No. No. No.

514
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,580
Okay, stay with me. Stay with me.

515
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,246
It's gonna be okay. Look at me.

516
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,345
Look at me.

517
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,738
No! Nina, quiet. Nina.

518
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,364
Please. Please, for me.

519
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,102
Just shut the fuck up.

520
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,337
I'm gonna get this out.

521
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,850
No! No!

522
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,856
Just do it, Bobby. Just fucking do it.

523
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,426
Bobby!

524
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,875
No!

525
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,546
Why wouldn't you just shut the fuck up?

526
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,420
You just needed to shut up!

527
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:44,059
No! Oh, my God!

528
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,560
No! Help!

529
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,801
Help! Help!

530
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,138
Here you are, ma'am. Take care.

531
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,432
Ma'am, your name?

532
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,272
Sara, without an "H."

533
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,441
I just want to say I love your book so much.

534
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:41,781
I just felt like I could feel everything
that you went through.

535
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,046
I feel like it changed my life.

536
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,982
I appreciate that, ma'am.

537
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,591
I really do. Thank you.

538
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,622
Thank you.

539
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,869
Your name, sir?

540
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,961
John.

541
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,071
With an "H," without an "H,"
it doesn't matter.

542
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,611
We'll go with John with an "H" this time.

543
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:12,307
You got quite an army working for you here,
don't you?

544
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,878
Must be spreading a pretty good word.

545
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,284
Well, we try to reach as many
people as possible, you know?

546
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,550
You don't see anything wrong with that?

547
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,255
No. No, sir, I don't.

548
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,392
You know,

549
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,461
history is a passion for me.

550
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,732
And in ancient Egypt
if you were speaking under oath,

551
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,237
you were required to say,

552
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:41,243
"If I'm lying, take me to the quarries."

553
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,581
That mean anything to you?

554
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,083
No, sir. No, sir, it doesn't.

555
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,551
Well, I'll tell you what it means.

556
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:54,181
It means if you knowingly lied
on the public record

557
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,627
that you were subject
to a period of enslavement.

558
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,525
What are you implying here, sir?

559
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,188
I'm not implying anything.

560
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,994
Move along, buddy. He signed your book.

561
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,464
Thanks for the signature.

562
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,963
Nice picture, but I don't need it.

563
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,339
We've met.

564
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,750
Adam, Gibson says he wants
you on these right away.

565
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,019
They're from the junkyard.

566
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,230
<i>Make your choice.</i>

567
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,134
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

568
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,004
See that?

569
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,139
Yeah.

570
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,204
I know that from somewhere.

571
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,839
Hey, I've got something over here.

572
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:54,515
We might know who's in the game.
This was just sent to us.

573
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:57,587
It was taken
from a security camera downtown.

574
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,349
The guy's name is Bobby Dagen.

575
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:00,582
- Familiar?
- No.

576
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:04,024
He's a Jigsaw survivor
who's milking it on talk shows.

577
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:07,089
His wife and handlers are also missing.

578
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:36,852
Joyce?

579
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,055
Who is it? Who's there?

580
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,129
- Suzanne.
- Who is that?

581
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,097
For fuck's sake, Bobby. Bobby.

582
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:45,896
Bobby, get me out of here.

583
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:47,231
Bobby, help me.

584
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,396
- Is Cale here?
- Who the fuck knows?

585
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,600
Get this off of me, Bobby! Get this off of me!

586
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,273
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>

587
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:03,410
<i>That feeling running</i>
<i>through your body is fear,</i>

588
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,479
<i>the fear of not knowing</i>
<i>if you have what it takes to survive.</i>

589
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,456
<i>Before you is your lawyer</i>

590
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,084
<i>who swore an oath of ethics,</i>

591
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:16,132
<i>but chose to see no evil</i>
<i>in order to benefit herself.</i>

592
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,258
<i>Once her device begins to rotate,</i>

593
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,666
<i>it will pierce her eyes and mouth</i>

594
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:24,639
<i>if you don't delay its movement</i>
<i>for at least 30 seconds.</i>

595
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:25,765
<i>To do this,</i>

596
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:30,813
<i>you must step into the other machine</i>
<i>and lift the bars to the highest position</i>

597
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:35,476
<i>long enough to close the circuit,</i>
<i>slowing down her device.</i>

598
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,646
<i>If you do nothing, she will wind to her death</i>

599
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,222
<i>before the clock runs out.</i>

600
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,854
<i>Do you have what it takes to help her?</i>

601
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,251
<i>Make your choice.</i>

602
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,157
Bobby, please!

603
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,026
Bobby, please get me out!

604
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,490
Get me the fuck...

605
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,057
Oh, God!

606
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,495
No, no! Bobby, please!

607
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,438
Please, help me!

608
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,001
Oh, God! Oh, God!

609
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,240
Please, hurry! Hurry!

610
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:09,047
Come on, Bobby, please! Hurry!

611
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,279
Come on! Bobby, come on!

612
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:15,183
Hurry! Please! Please, hurry!

613
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,360
Bobby, please, hurry!

614
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:24,456
Hurry!

615
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:33,099
Yes! Yes, Bobby! Yes!

616
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,939
Come on!

617
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,311
Bobby, no.

618
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:49,420
No! God, no!

619
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,323
No! Bobby!

620
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,295
Please, no! Bobby, no!

621
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,694
Come on, Bobby. Please!
Get me out of here!

622
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,427
Come on!

623
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,935
Bobby, please!

624
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,106
No!

625
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:04,431
Oh, God.

626
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:07,141
Oh, my God. Bobby, stay there.

627
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,615
Bobby, please, no!

628
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,578
No! No!

629
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,379
No!

630
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,424
Please, please!

631
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:27,730
No!

632
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,093
Oh, God!

633
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,101
Oh, my God.

634
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,113
No. No.

635
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,409
Help!

636
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,260
Do you know this guy?

637
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,804
I've seen him on TV, but I don't know him.

638
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:47,443
Did your husband?

639
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,006
I don't know.

640
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,840
You sure you don't know him?

641
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,213
Yeah, I'm sure.

642
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,585
All right then.

643
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,823
Lock it up.

644
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:07,563
Hoffman just sent an e-mail
with an MPEG attachment.

645
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,928
I'm just searching the IP address.

646
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,557
Can you find out where it came from?

647
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:15,331
It depends on how many proxy servers
he filtered it through,

648
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:18,033
but it was time-delayed,
so it'll leave fingerprints.

649
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,130
Play it.

650
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,972
<i>Hello, Gibson.</i>

651
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,006
<i>Once again, we're at a moral crossroad.</i>

652
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:28,314
<i>I don't blame you</i>
<i>for not giving me Jill Tuck,</i>

653
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,948
<i>but you shouldn't let an old grudge</i>
<i>cloud your judgment.</i>

654
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,419
<i>Look to where you're being led.</i>

655
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,084
<i>Look beyond the crossroad</i>
<i>to the clear dawn.</i>

656
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,426
<i>Do you see it?</i>

657
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,095
I get it. Let's go.

658
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:05,910
Joyce?

659
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:25,741
Cale?

660
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,241
Bobby? Bobby?

661
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:30,077
Listen to me. Cale.
Cale, I can see you, okay?

662
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,677
- Cale, don't move.
- Bobby, where the hell are you?

663
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,883
- You got to help me, Bobby.
- Do you know where Joyce is?

664
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,417
What the fuck? I can't see, man.

665
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,680
How the fuck would I know where Joyce is?

666
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:38,913
I'm about to lose my shit!

667
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:40,853
Do I know where Joyce is?
I'm fucking blind, man.

668
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,982
Okay, Cale. Cale, do not move.

669
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,484
I got this thing around my fucking neck.
I can't fucking breathe.

670
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:47,825
Don't fucking move.
We're not on the ground floor.

671
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,159
A lot of this floor is missing.

672
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,200
Just don't move, okay?

673
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,263
Fuck. You gotta help me.

674
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:57,705
Get me fucking down, Bobby! Fuck!
Fuck me!

675
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,035
Cale, there's a tape.

676
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,702
- What fucking tape?
- There's a tape.

677
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,369
Shut up. I'm gonna play the tape.

678
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:11,645
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>
<i>Across from you is your closest friend.</i>

679
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:17,421
<i>He knows all your sins,</i>
<i>yet he acts as though he hears no evil.</i>

680
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,620
<i>Today, what he hears</i>

681
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:23,130
<i>will be the difference</i>
<i>between life and death.</i>

682
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,464
<i>Bobby, you must help</i>
<i>Cale walk over the planks,</i>

683
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,765
<i>and get as close to you as possible.</i>

684
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,739
<i>Find your own way across</i>
<i>the beams to the key.</i>

685
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:36,972
<i>You must get it to him over</i>
<i>the last span between you.</i>

686
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,642
<i>If the noose around Cale's neck</i>
<i>is not removed within 60 seconds,</i>

687
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:46,188
<i>a winch will be engaged,</i>
<i>and your secret will be left hanging.</i>

688
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:50,186
<i>Does Cale live or die, Bobby?</i>
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

689
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,555
Bobby!

690
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:52,685
Oh, God.

691
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:55,721
Cale. Cale, listen to me.

692
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,124
Listen to me.

693
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,293
Shut the fuck up
and you listen to me for once.

694
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,337
Listen, I'm gonna walk you through this,
okay, buddy?

695
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:03,963
I'm blind. You fucking come to me.

696
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,065
I'm gonna try to get as close to you
as I can, buddy.

697
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,303
I'm fucking listening to you.
Talk me fucking through this.

698
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,743
I want you to shuffle to your right.

699
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:12,915
Just shuffle exactly to your right.

700
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,083
You're gonna feel a plank at your foot.
Yes, yes.

701
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:19,121
Yes, yes, perfect.
I need you to head out on that plank.

702
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,246
- Oh, fuck.
- Yes.

703
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,288
Okay, I got it. I got it. I got it!

704
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:26,861
Fuck this.

705
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,857
Okay, Cale, I'm on the way.

706
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,762
Fuck. Fuck. Okay, all right.

707
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,061
Now there's gonna be a plank
in front of you.

708
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,804
- Okay.
- You're gonna have to go

709
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,395
about 10 degrees to your right.

710
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,973
I got it. I got it.

711
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,339
- Come on, keep fucking talking to me.
- Okay. Okay, Cale.

712
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,976
- Feel where the plank...
- I got it.

713
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:45,514
Okay.

714
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,609
Oh, God! What the fuck was that, man?

715
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:51,243
It's okay, Cale. It was a bottle.
It was a bottle.

716
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:54,016
- What the fuck was that?
- It's okay. It was a bottle.

717
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,615
- You're gonna be fine.
- Okay.

718
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,252
Fuck. Okay.

719
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:00,522
You got it, buddy.

720
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:03,727
You got it.
Now you're gonna feel a second plank.

721
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,927
- You'll feel it with your foot.
- I got it.

722
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,170
Feel it with your foot.

723
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,941
Get me out of this fucking thing, Bobby.

724
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:14,510
Step up onto the plank.

725
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,811
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

726
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:20,909
Relax. You're okay.

727
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:26,316
No! No!

728
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,490
Cale, hang on. Cale.

729
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,157
Fuck. Fuck.

730
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,126
Fuck. Fuck.

731
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,311
Bobby. Bobby.

732
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:07,723
I got the key but... Cale!

733
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:09,899
I'm gonna throw you the key.

734
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:12,160
Cup your hands closer to your chest!

735
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,236
I'm gonna throw it on three, all right?

736
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,239
One,

737
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,041
two,

738
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,110
three.

739
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,639
No.

740
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:32,653
Oh, fuck me.

741
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,228
No! God damn it, no!

742
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,191
Cale!

743
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,970
No. Cale.

744
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,515
There's nothing here.

745
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,057
Yes, there is.

746
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,191
Right there.

747
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,328
Why would he want us to come here?

748
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,596
For me to remember.

749
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:23,137
This is where he saved my life.

750
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:28,002
When I was in uniform
I responded to a distress call here.

751
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:32,413
<i>Back when this place was a flophouse</i>
<i>for junkies and homeless people.</i>

752
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,561
Freeze! Don't you fucking move.

753
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:56,137
Drop the gun.

754
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,038
<i>He didn't know what hit him.</i>

755
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:13,287
Yeah, he assaulted me,
but it shouldn't have been a death sentence.

756
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,696
Next time, you shoot first.

757
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:28,302
<i>I had no choice</i>
<i>but to report Hoffman for brutality.</i>

758
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:29,530
You owe me.

759
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,478
<i>What happened?</i>

760
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:42,213
He got a promotion is what happened.
And I got put on an island.

761
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,814
A year later, I transferred to IA,
busted three of his guys.

762
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:49,517
He swore he'd get me back, and here we are.

763
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:54,686
This place was called
Crossroads Manufacturing before it closed.

764
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:58,760
"Look beyond the crossroads

765
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,332
"to the clear dawn."

766
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:04,596
I don't follow you.

767
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:08,336
The man he killed was released from
Clear Dawn Psychiatric Hospital

768
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,241
when the state shut it down.

769
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:12,003
That building's been abandoned for years.

770
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:15,147
That's where the game is being played.

771
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,981
All right, you get back,
you stay with Jill Tuck.

772
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,351
Don't let her out of your sight.

773
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:39,842
<i>Bobby!</i>

774
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,478
- Joyce?
<i>- Bobby. Bobby!</i>

775
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,015
<i>Bobby, I'm here.</i>

776
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:49,918
- Joyce.
<i>- Bobby, can you hear me?</i>

777
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,816
Joyce, I can hear you. I can see you.

778
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,548
<i>Bobby, I can see you, too.</i>

779
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,814
Yes, baby.

780
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:59,052
- Get me out of here.
<i>- Baby, I'm on my way.</i>

781
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,358
Who's doing this? Why?

782
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:04,126
<i>- Why is this happening?</i>
- Please, baby, I'm on the way.

783
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:07,631
<i>- Just hang on, okay?</i>
- Hurry. Please hurry.

784
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,437
There's got to be a tape.

785
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:12,474
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>

786
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:16,342
<i>Before you is the door</i>
<i>that leads to your wife.</i>

787
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,779
<i>However, you must first make a choice.</i>

788
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:24,410
<i>As you may have guessed, your decision</i>
<i>will be as difficult as pulling teeth.</i>

789
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:30,423
<i>The lock before you requires</i>
<i>a four-digit combination to open.</i>

790
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:33,552
<i>However, if it is access you seek</i>

791
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,160
<i>then a true sacrifice will have to be made.</i>

792
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,462
<i>Watch and learn, Bobby.</i>

793
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:49,276
<i>The necessary numbers have been etched</i>
<i>onto two of your teeth.</i>

794
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:54,505
<i>Look to the chart as a reference</i>
<i>for which teeth to pull</i>

795
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:57,518
<i>and in which order to enter the digits.</i>

796
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:00,886
<i>Time is ticking down.</i>

797
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,916
<i>You must make your decision quickly.</i>

798
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,090
<i>Bobby!</i>

799
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,427
I don't want you to see this, baby, okay?

800
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:14,901
Oh, my God.

801
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:19,035
<i>No.</i>

802
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:22,533
<i>No!</i>

803
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,177
Left side clear.

804
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:27,449
Clear.

805
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,019
- Clear.
- Clear.

806
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,587
Change your position.

807
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:34,921
The game's still on.

808
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,201
- Let's go.
- Move to the second level.

809
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,208
- Clear.
- Clear.

810
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,672
Clear.

811
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:00,071
Go.

812
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,863
- Clear up.
- All clear.

813
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,159
Move, move.

814
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,232
- Moving in.
- Moving in.

815
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,302
- Clear.
- We're clear.

816
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,876
Block it off.

817
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:38,244
<i>- What?</i>
- I found where that MPEG came from.

818
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,515
<i>- Where?</i>
- A business called Pete's Auto Body

819
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:41,885
on 58th Street.

820
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:44,516
<i>- The junkyard.</i>
- The location of the car trap?

821
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:46,060
Yeah, that's correct.

822
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,062
Okay, you guys keep moving.

823
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,497
Where are you going?

824
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:53,001
To get Hoffman.

825
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,967
Okay, let's move it.

826
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,938
Rogers.

827
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,674
Yeah.

828
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,818
What? What happened?

829
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,784
Gibson's got Hoffman's location.

830
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,182
The game isn't over.

831
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,908
Another body.

832
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:37,703
Hold.

833
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:42,910
We got a live one.

834
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:02,100
Can't cross here. Let's go.

835
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,250
Hey. Go get your shotguns.
You come follow me.

836
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,226
Give me your gun.

837
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,487
Hoffman, freeze.

838
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,121
I want you to slowly put your hands
in the air.

839
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,169
Joyce.

840
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,242
Bobby.

841
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,969
Bobby, I knew you'd make it.

842
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:52,739
I knew you'd find me.

843
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:54,076
I am so sorry.

844
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:55,741
I knew you could do it.

845
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:57,782
I knew you'd come.

846
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,087
Get me out.

847
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:04,453
Bobby. Oh, my God.

848
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:06,759
There's gotta be another way.

849
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:14,967
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>
<i>You have almost completed your rebirth.</i>

850
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:19,440
<i>However, your final task</i>
<i>will be your most difficult.</i>

851
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:22,943
<i>The woman before you</i>
<i>symbolizes your success.</i>

852
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,478
<i>She is your trophy.</i>

853
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,242
<i>And she has seen the good</i>
<i>in your message,</i>

854
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,477
<i>despite its dishonest beginnings.</i>

855
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:30,984
What's he talking about?

856
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:35,183
<i>Today, we will see</i>
<i>if you can truly earn her love.</i>

857
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:39,360
<i>To prove your status as a survivor,</i>

858
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:43,796
<i>you must overcome a game</i>
<i>that should be all too familiar.</i>

859
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,368
- No.
<i>- You supposedly survived it once already,</i>

860
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:51,372
<i>so it should be easy to survive once again.</i>

861
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,576
<i>Pierce the hooks</i>
<i>through your chest muscles,</i>

862
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,167
<i>and the game will begin.</i>

863
01:06:56,278 --> 01:07:01,272
<i>In order to free yourself and your wife,</i>
<i>you must hoist yourself with these chains,</i>

864
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:07,248
<i>and connect the extension cords above you</i>
<i>before the clock expires.</i>

865
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:13,394
<i>Both hands will be needed</i>
<i>to complete this task.</i>

866
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,361
<i>But that should be simple.</i>

867
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:18,228
<i>For, as you claim to understand,</i>

868
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:21,899
<i>the pectoral muscles</i>
<i>can easily support your weight.</i>

869
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:23,733
<i>So I ask you, Bobby,</i>

870
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:27,070
<i>when you embrace every day</i>
<i>as if it is your last,</i>

871
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:29,667
<i>will it be with your wife?</i>

872
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,305
<i>Make your choice.</i>

873
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,248
What's he talking about?

874
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:37,080
Baby, I'm so sorry.

875
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:40,622
I lied.

876
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,619
I was never in a trap.

877
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:51,992
Clear.

878
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,383
How could you let me believe that?

879
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,725
I'm gonna make this right.

880
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,658
You don't deserve to be there.

881
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,834
I'm your wife.

882
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,402
How could you lie to me?

883
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:41,143
I know that from somewhere.

884
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:44,611
Make your choice. Clock's ticking.

885
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:58,190
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

886
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:01,461
What is this, sir?

887
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:05,233
Hoffman tapped
into the station's security system.

888
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,138
He's been watching us the whole time.

889
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,331
Oh, my God.

890
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,007
- This is Palmer.
<i>- Listen.</i>

891
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,174
You get every available officer
back to the station.

892
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:49,251
I'm sorry, sir?

893
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,682
Right now.

894
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:53,043
Sir.

895
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,231
Gibson, are you still there? Gibson.

896
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,685
- Door's locked!
- We're locked in!

897
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,189
Gas! Gas!

898
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:13,624
Look for an exit.

899
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,591
I love you, Joyce.

900
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:40,458
I never lied about that.

901
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:43,423
I love you. I love you.

902
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:45,159
Bobby, I love you.

903
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:52,302
No! Oh, my God.

904
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:55,502
No.

905
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:01,877
No.

906
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:08,950
Gibson.

907
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:24,403
You can do it. You can do it.

908
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:30,712
Oh, my God.

909
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:38,577
Bobby, I love you.

910
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,167
You can do it.

911
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:02,203
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

912
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,045
Pull. Pull, Bobby. I know you can do it.

913
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:07,773
Pull.

914
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,348
Oh, my God. Keep going.

915
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:14,320
Bobby, you can do it. Oh, my God.

916
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:15,549
Bobby!

917
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:17,851
Pull!

918
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,218
What was that?

919
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,883
That's it, pull. Pull!

920
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,015
Pull.

921
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,586
Hurry!

922
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:55,987
Pull. You're almost there.

923
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,302
Fight, Bobby. You can do it.

924
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:05,332
Someone's out there.

925
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:15,240
Oh, my God. No!

926
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,714
Help me! Help me!

927
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:21,356
Help me! No!

928
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:31,993
I've been looking for you.

929
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:55,779
How do I look?

930
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:04,691
Bitch.

931
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:08,660
Help me!

932
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:13,966
Bobby, please, reach.

933
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:16,511
Go.

934
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,177
Bobby, reach.

935
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:21,416
Hurry.

936
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,579
Reach. Reach!

937
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,175
You can do it, Bobby.

938
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:40,261
Bobby, reach. Reach.

939
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,200
One more. Reach. You can do it. Bobby!

940
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:46,774
Bobby, you can do it.

941
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:55,250
Bobby!

942
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:00,770
No!

943
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:04,280
Bobby!

944
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:10,749
No. Bobby!

945
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:13,520
Joyce!

946
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,258
Bobby!

947
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:20,690
Joyce!

948
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,201
Bobby! Bobby!

949
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,466
Joyce! Joyce!

950
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:33,873
Bobby!

951
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:50,394
You fucking cunt.

952
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:58,038
No! Bobby!

953
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:05,970
Joyce!

954
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,172
No!

955
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:22,355
Bobby!

956
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:34,736
Joyce!

957
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,757
Game over.

958
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:18,909
<i>Over the last two hours,</i>

959
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:22,177
<i>it seems our entire city</i>
<i>has been shaken to its core.</i>

960
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:25,048
<i>In addition to the nine police</i>
<i>employees killed tonight,</i>

961
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:28,645
<i>Jill Tuck, the wife of serial killer</i>
<i>John Kramer, has been found dead.</i>

962
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:32,117
<i>Citizens are being advised</i>
<i>to report any activity,</i>

963
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,593
<i>even remotely suspicious, at this time,</i>

964
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:37,426
<i>as blockades are being set up</i>
<i>at major intersections</i>

965
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:39,124
<i>within a 30-mile radius,</i>

966
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:42,499

967
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:45,334
<i>on this city's police department</i>
<i>in our history.</i>

968
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:49,537
<i>Any citizens with information</i>

969
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:24,611
What the fuck?

970
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:44,460
<i>Hello, Dr. Gordon.</i>

971
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,360
<i>You are perhaps my greatest asset.</i>

972
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:06,053
Congratulations, Dr. Gordon. You survived.

973
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:26,335
<i>Without you, my work over the last few years</i>

Jeff's wife.

975
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:38,016
Dr. Lynn Denlon.

976
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:43,816
She'll be perfect.

977
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:52,762
My eyes! I can't see!

978
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:11,176
<i>That having been said, I have a request.</i>

979
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:12,719
<i>Watch over Jill.</i>

980
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:19,684
<i>And should anything happen to her,</i>
<i>I want you to act immediately on my behalf.</i>

981
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:24,960
<i>In return for that,</i>
<i>I will keep no more secrets from you.</i>

982
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:29,369
<i>I've shown you a lot of places.</i>

983
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:35,532
<i>But there is one that will be, perhaps,</i>
<i>the most meaningful to you.</i>

984
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:17,177
I don't think so.

985
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,022
What do you think you're doing?

986
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,392
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

987
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:45,768
No!

988
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:48,548
You can't fucking do this to me.

989
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:51,419
Fuck you. No!

990
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:52,577
Game over.

991
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:53,881
No!
