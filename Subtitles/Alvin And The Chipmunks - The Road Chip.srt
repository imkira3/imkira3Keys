17
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:13,366
<i>Okay, fine, so it might be</i>
<i>a medium-sized get-together.</i>

18
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:15,702
Alvin, did you
hire someone to build

19
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,370
a half-pipe in the back yard?

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,998
Of course not!
The party planner did.

21
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:21,499
You hired a party planner?

22
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,210
No, he did not hire
a "party planner."

23
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:25,670
Oh, thank goodness.
For a minute there, I...

24
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:27,672
I am an event planner.

25
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,674
Marco, I'm done
giving you instructions.

26
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:30,842
Oh, boy.

27
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,762
<i>Dave, it's all good.</i>
<i>It's just us.</i>

<i>Oops! Um, hi.</i>

31
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:44,314
So, the guest list got
a little out of hand.

32
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:45,690
A little?

33
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:47,066
<i>Dave, I had nothing</i>

00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:52,197
Redfoo is here?

36
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,032
<i>Yeah, he is,</i>
<i>because I got him here.</i>

37
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,577
<i>The Redfoo, from a little band</i>

<i>What?</i>

39
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:01,080
<i>Well, there's no way</i>
<i>to sugarcoat it, Dave.</i>

40
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:02,248
<i>The cops are here! Ow...</i>

41
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,583

<i>Happy Birthday, Dave!</i>

43
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,462
This does wonders
for my glutes!

44
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,422
This party is the least
we can do for you, Dave.

45
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:12,008
<i>Yeah! Giving up</i>

00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:34,823

Nice!

I know my work schedule
is tough...

127
00:05:58,651 --> 00:05:59,861
but I thought you guys
were old enough

to take care of yourselves.

129

not mature enough for that.

130
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:05,408

We are very mature.

A more stable chapter...

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,209
where you guys
aren't performing

135
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:16,836
in a different city
every night.

136
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,504
But, we love to perform.

137
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:21,299
You can go back to that,
just not now, okay?

138
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,009

to have a few years

00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,803
But we're not
normal kids, Dave.

144
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,310
you're acting like
a bunch of animals...

145
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:36,481
who just threw a giant house
party without my permission.

146
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:39,484
Does this mean
no miniature golf tomorrow?

147
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,194
It should, and normally,
it would.

148
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,488
But, you're gonna give us
one last chance, right?

149
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:47,992
I think he means
our 158th last chance?

150
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,827
Look, selfishly,
I wanna spend as much time

151

152

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,055
I only got a plus one,

162
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,057
so it wouldn't be fair
to pick favorites.

163
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:12,266
Shh...

164
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,811
We both know
I'm your favorite.

165
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:15,937
Alvin.

166
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,355
Tied for favorite?

167
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,357
You don't even have to
say with who.

168
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:22,068
Blink once for Theodore,
twice for Simon.

169
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:25,029
Got it, no favorites.

170
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,874
Wind, 35 degrees,
out of the northwest.

171
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,211
Okay, tail up.
10, 10 degrees down.

172
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:41,546
Shoulders up, shoulders down.

173
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,256
Shoulders to the left,
shoulders to the right.

174
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:44,507
Tail in, tail out.

175
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,633
Ah. While we're young, Simon.

176
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,717
Loosen the grip,
loosen the grip.

177
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,135
Not too loose,
not too loose, Simon.

178
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,595
Any day, now.
And...

179
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:50,930
my concentration is broken.

180
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:53,015
Now I have to start all over.
Oh, great!

181
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,141
Let's start this
charade again.

182
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:55,268
Oh, come on!

183
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,228
This isn't the PGA Tour,
Simon.

184
00:07:57,395 --> 00:08:00,231
Exactly. But this
is what it's all about.

185
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:02,233
Just 4 dudes
playing some golf.

186
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,068
Actually, that reminds me,
uh...

187
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:05,820
I invited a friend to join us.

188
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,738
Oh, is this
the famous Samantha

189
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,156
we've been hearing
so much about?

190
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,200
- It is.
- David!

191
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,202
Ooh la la.

192
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:17,290
<i>♪ Dave and Samantha</i>
<i>sittin' in a tree... ♪</i>

193
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,916
Very funny, guys.

194
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,752
Anyway, it's starting to feel
kind of serious, so...

195
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,921
I thought an introduction
would be nice.

196
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,090
You must really
like this girl, Dave.

197
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:27,925
I do,
and I hope you guys do, too.

198
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:31,512
Yeah. Any girlfriend of yours
is a girlfriend of ours.

199
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:34,599
That sounded
way less weird in my head.

200
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,267
You think?

201
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:37,768
She's here.

202
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,270
How do I look?

203
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:40,771
Well, uh...

204
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:43,316
You know? Looks.

205
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:45,443
Alvin! This is no time
for honesty.

206
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,111
You look great,
Dave.

207
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,281
That sweater makes you look
like a cozy grandpa.

208
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:51,908
Thanks, Theodore.

209
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,827
Okay, where was I?
Shoulders up, shoulders down.

210
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,455
Oh, brother.
Hit the ball, already!

211
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:58,623
Okay!

212
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,958
Look at it soar!

213
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,627
Follow me, come on guys!

214
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:03,794
Wow.

215
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,879
Awesome!

216
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,255
Come on!

217
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,342
Follow the ball!
Through the mouth!

218
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,010
Open wide!
Whoo-hoo!

219
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,470
Hurry up!

220
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:14,972
Hurry, Theodore!

221
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,098
I'm going as fast as I can!

222
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,224
Turn, turn!

223
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:18,976
My wind calculations
were accurate!

224
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,311
Come on, guys!

225
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,771
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

226
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,189
It's a hole-in...

227
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:26,317
No! Why?

228
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,444
Excuse me,
that's my brother's ball.

229
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,488
Oh, uh, this ball?

230
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:31,864
No, no, this is my ball.

231
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,824
What? I just hit
that beautiful shot.

232
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,242
Tell you what,
let's compromise,

233
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,828
and we'll call it...
no one's ball.

234
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,163
Hey!

235
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,331
I'm warning you.

236
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:43,000
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us.

237
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,210
Yeah!
Aw.

238
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:45,628
I'm terrified.

239
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,004
Ah!

240
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:48,631
What, what? Ouch! Wait!

241
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:49,840
What are you gonna do?

242
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,135
We will continue this
conversation when I'm back.

243
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:54,971
Hey, dude,
it's your turn.

244
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:56,180
Oh, yeah.

245
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:58,140
Whatever!
I don't even need that ball!

246
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:00,434
Si's right,
you're not worth it!

247
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:01,644
Yeah!

248
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:03,938
Oh, Dave,
thank goodness.

249
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,022
Hey, Dave.

250
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,233
Hey, guys. This is Samantha.

251
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,318
Sam, these are my boys.
Hi.

252
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,903
Hi.
That's Theodore.

253
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:11,988
He might be the smallest,

254
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,114
but he's got
the biggest heart.

255
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,198
Hi.

256
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,825
Ooh, we've heard
a lot about you.

257
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,327
<i>Enchanté.</i>

258
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,039
I can tell
that you're trouble.

259
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,959
If by "trouble,"
you mean "irresistible,"

260
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,669
then guilty as charged.

261
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:29,255
Alvin, of course.
And there's Simon.

262
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:30,464
So, you're a doctor?

263
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:31,590
I am.

264
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:32,675
Did Dave mention that?

265
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,678
No, you're wearing
a stethoscope.

266
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,557
Yes, I am.
That's embarrassing.

267
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:41,600
Would it
be okay if I tried it?

268
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,019
Yeah, knock yourself out.

269
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,186
Oh, thank you.

270
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:48,232
Heart rate is smooth
and steady, 400 BPM.

271
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,734
So, it's beating?

272
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,235
Of course it's beating.

273
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,404
It's so nice to finally
meet you guys.

274
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:55,906
Oh, and this is my son, Miles.

275
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,992
Son?
Oh, no.

276
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,201
You guys have a lot in common.

277
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:00,619
Miles is also a musician.

278
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,954
Yeah, I've heard
you're pretty good.

279
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,039
Thanks, Mr. Seville.

280
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,290
Oh, brother.

281
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:05,583
We thought this
was the perfect place

282
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,251
for you guys to get to know
each other better.

283
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,420
Yes, so behave, okay?

284
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:10,963
And Theo, get down from there.

285
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,298
I'll get him.

286
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:16,135
So, back to our conversation.

287
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,137
No hard feelings, huh?

288
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,265
Hey, you guys having fun?

289
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,434
Yeah, just
getting some cotton candy.

290
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:24,727
All right.

291
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,273
This is not my idea of fun.

292
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,441
Mmm...

293
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,650
Yummy.

294
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:32,777
Theo!

295
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,073
Alvin,
where did Theodore go?

296
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,575
I don't know, I haven't
seen him since the last hole.

297
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:40,785
What do you think?

298
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,329
Uh, 20 bucks seems like
a lot of money for a chipmunk.

299
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:44,747
He's a talking chipmunk.

300
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:47,249
Go on, plump and juicy,
say something.

301
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,918
Um, I also sing.

302

00:11:58,636 --> 00:11:59,637
I know.

306
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,055
Why don't you
check the river?

307
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,139
Chip shot!

308

Whoa!

309
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,143
Alvin, I found him.

310
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,187
Give us back our brother!
Yeah!

311
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:09,480
I just paid 20 bucks for him.

312
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:10,815
He's not for sale!

313
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,150
I want 40.
What?

314
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,527
He's a talking chipmunk.

I hope you're happy,
Theodore.

325
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,172
That was all of our allowance.

326
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,424
Sorry.
I was born to perform.

327
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,509
Great news, fellas.

328
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,177
You get to hang
with Miles all day.

329
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,680
And the hits
just keep on coming. Oh.

330
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,306
Sam got a page
from the hospital,

331
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,308
so I'm going to take you four
to the studio with me.

332
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,518
All right, be good.

333
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:48,686
Bye, Mom.
Bye, honey.

334
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:49,770
Don't forget your stethoscope.

335
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:50,896
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

336
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:51,981
You know what? Keep it.

337
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,065
Thanks.

338
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,191
Break a leg.

339
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,194
That doesn't really apply
to doctors, Dave.

340
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,487
Right.

341
00:12:58,571 --> 00:12:59,697
Good luck!

342
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:01,991
You kind of hope your heart
surgeon doesn't need luck.

343
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:03,868
Uh... Have fun!

344
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,912
Nailed it!

345
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,093
Look, paparazzi.

346
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,721
I guess they heard
we were coming.

347
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,725
Hey, guys!
Ah, it is good to see you.

348
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:28,976
Can you get one more
from this side?

349
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,227
Yeah.

350
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,062
Guys, they aren't
here for you, come on.

351
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:33,606

- That's my tail!
- Excuse me.

365
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:10,100
First, can you guys apologize
for trampling my friends?

366
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,604
Aw, sorry about that, guys.

367
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:14,897
Thank you, Ashley.
Sure.

368
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,106
Miss Grey, when
are you going back on tour?

369
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:17,816
Miss Grey, over here.

370
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,859
Oh, hey, you know what?

371
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,236
Let me,
let me get this for you.

372
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,322
Oh, you know,
I think it's "Push."

373
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,783
Oh, yeah,
you know, of course.

374
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,619
Whoa. Okay.

375
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,624
Looks like Mr. Macho isn't
as cool as he thinks he is.

376

379
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,925
I didn't realize
how boring it is

380
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,635
to be on this side
of the glass.

381
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,971
Yeah, why aren't
you guys in there?

382
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,473
I thought you were, like,
super famous or something?

383
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:52,601
One day, you're throwing back
pink lemonades

384
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:54,311
on Diddy's yacht
in Saint-Tropez...

385
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:55,688
Ooh, jackpot!

386
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,856
...and the next,
you're eating stale chips

387
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,191
you find in the couch.

388
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,026
I miss it.

389
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,530
Uh, uh... Theodore, couch
chips are for talent only.

390
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,781
Oh.

391
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,116
Really, Barry?

392
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,327
All right, you can keep it.
Just don't tell anyone, okay?

393
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:11,996
Whoo-hoo! Yum.

394
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,666
<i>We did it!</i>

395
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,127
We successfully introduced
our kids to each other.

396
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,337
And then, you performed
open-heart surgery.

397
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,922
Please, after being
a single mom

398
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,716
and a med student,
I could do this in my sleep.

399
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,511
And I wore my stethoscope
out again, didn't I?

400
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,471
I thought it was cute.

401
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,224
And I like people to know
I'm dating a doctor.

402
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,227
All right, I guess my life

403
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,521
is a little more hectic
than I'd like to admit.

404
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:38,689
I get it.

405
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,234
So, I have to ask. The boys?

406
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,653
Are they, like,
your adopted kids, or...

407
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,821
How does that work?

408
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,240
I don't know, I never really
thought about it.

409
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:51,827
What?

410
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,205
They're lucky to have you.

411
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,334
Crazy idea.

412
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,212
Have you ever been to Miami?

413
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,760
<i>This is</i> American Idol!

414
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,221
<i>I'm sorry</i>
<i>to have to do this...</i>

415
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,557
<i>but you're going to Hollywood!</i>

416
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:18,187
Ah. I've always
wanted to say that!

417
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,065
Why did they get to move out
and do all this cool stuff?

418
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,399
Uh, well, Alvin...

419
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,318
girls are
scientifically proven

420
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,903
to mature faster than boys.

421
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,237
Ah, whatever.

422
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,781
Hey, guys.

423
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:29,865
- Dave!
- Hi.

424
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,283
Sorry I'm late.
I had to pick up

425
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,409
a few things on the way home.

426
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,453
No worries,
we've just been ruminating

427
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,080
on why we still live at home.

428
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,748
So, what'd you guys
think of Samantha?

429
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:38,957
Oh, she's awesome.

430
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,167
We loved her.

431
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,586
Ooh, leftovers.

432
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,716
Ooh, I can't wait.

433
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,969
Oh, I can taste it.
Yes! Yummy.

434
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,931
Oh. I can't eat this.

435
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:57,059
Whoa! That is a serious
engagement ring.

436
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,937
Wait a second. That means
Dave is going to ask

437
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,814
Samantha to marry him.

438
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,774
Hold on, we don't know that.

439
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,609
They've only been together
a few months,

440
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,444
so you're probably
overreacting.

441
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,612
But what if it's true?

442
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,156
Uh-oh. Here he comes.

443
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,324
Act casual.

444
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,329
Huh.
What are you guys doing?

445
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,083
Uh, yoga. Downward munk?

446
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,209
Well, that's great
to hear that

447
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,961
you guys like Samantha,
because...

448
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,963
she's gonna become
a big part of my life.

449
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,506
Oh, and good news.

450
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,466
My plus one
isn't going to waste.

451
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,510
She is coming
to Miami with me.

452
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,975
I'm standing right here.
I can hear what he's saying.

453
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,237
I've always wanted a mom.

454
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,321
Guys...

455
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,992
...if Samantha is our mom,
that makes Miles...

456
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,243
Our brother.

457
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,998
<i>No!</i>

458
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,834
Deep breaths, Theodore.
In and out.

459
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,544
It's going to be okay.

460
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,254
What are we gonna do?

461
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,506
Guys, it's time.

462
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,551
Operation ring retrieval
is a go.

463
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:14,678
No ring, no proposal.

464
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,055
No proposal, no Miles.

465
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,724
Theo, fall in line, soldier.

466
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,350
Oh, brother.

467
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,405
Alvin, what...
Are we doing a charade?

468
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,408
Oh, cool. Two words.

469
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,035
No.

470
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,204
First down? What are you...

471
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,581
Two syllables. Sounds like.

472
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:43,874
Is it a movie? First word.

473
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,042
A song?

474
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,210
Angry.
Get over here.

475
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,377
Okay.

476
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,254
Still no idea
what you're saying.

477
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,089
Theodore, you keep
an eye on Dave.

478
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:53,091
Simon and I will get the ring.

479
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,721
Uh-oh.

480
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,060
There you are.

481
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,145
Alvin, grab this.

482
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,239
Let's do this.

483
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:25,499
Yes!

484
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,417
The bag's gone.
No.

485
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,461
You mean that bag over there?

486
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,421
And I'm back to "Yes."

487
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:32,547
Uh-oh.

488
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:33,632
And right back to "No."

489
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,425
Abort. Abort. Let's go.

490
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,973
Guys...

491
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,183
what are you doing in here?

492
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,936
Uh... Well... We...

493
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,313
just wanted to spend
as much time as possible

494
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,524
with you before
you left for Miami.

495
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:51,775
Yeah.

496
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,610
All right.
I'll make breakfast.

497
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,821
Whoo-hoo! I love breakfast.

498
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,447
Alvin, grab it.

499
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:01,493
Ooh, ooh, Belgian waffles,
pancakes. So excited.

500
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:13,839
Okay, guys...

501
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,466
Miss Price from next door,
she's gonna peek in on you...

502
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,801
make sure you're all right.

503
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,469
What? She's nuts.

504
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,888
We should be the ones
checking in on her.

505
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,807
Well, after that big party
you guys threw...

506
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,517
I don't feel very comfortable
with you guys

507
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,436
staying here unsupervised.
You got it?

508
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:29,980
Oh, that must be
Samantha and Miles.

509
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,316
Miles?

510
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,318
Yeah, he's going to stay
with you guys for a few days.

511
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,945
So, you don't feel comfortable
leaving us alone,

512
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:40,240
but you're okay leaving us
with that psychopath?

513
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,742
No, he's a great kid.

514
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:42,909
It'll be fun.

515
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,286
You know, it'll be, uh,

516
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,330
a good bonding experience
for you guys.

517
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,749
Uh, I'm pretty sure
Miles would interpret

518
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,668
"bonding experience"
as super-gluing us together.

519
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,420
Hi.

520
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:54,713
Wow. Great place.

521
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,048
Oh, thanks.

522
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,424
Make yourself at home.

523
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,176
<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>

524
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:03,055
Thank you, David, that's
very generous of you
to open your home.

525
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,390
Wow. That's really impressive.

526
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,184
I actually don't
speak Spanish.

527
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,518
He said that it's
very generous

528
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,020
of you to open your home.

529
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,481
I also speak Spanish.

530
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,941
And you're not fooling anyone
with your good boy routine.

531
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,027
I'm fooling everyone.

532
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:21,531
They have no idea that
I'm going to make you
my personal servant.

533
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,369
All right. I guess this is it.
Have a great weekend, guys.

534
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,536
And boys...

535
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,872
try to show me you can handle
some independence, okay?

536
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:29,998
All right, bye, sweetie.
Be good.

537
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,208
Okay.

538
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,960
All right. Here we go.

539
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,962
I can feel the bonding
happening already.

540
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,800
We're gonna be doing
tons of bonding.

541
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,095
Where's the Super Glue?

542
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,225
Miles, if we're going
to make this work,

543
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,601
we need to talk.

544
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:50,977
Feels like it's working.

545
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,562
But, good talk.

546
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,731
You can't shut us out forever.

547
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,233
He means emotionally, but...

548
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,818
I want to focus
on the physically

549
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,569
shutting us out
of our own home part.

550
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:00,987
I have to pee.

551
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,155
You guys are so naive.

552
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,408
Trust me, this thing with
Dave and my mom is temporary.

553
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,577
If by temporary you mean,
"till death do they part"...

554
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,329
then yeah. Totally temporary.

555
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:10,831
What are you talking about?

556
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,958
He's talking
about marriage, Miles.

557
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,292
Wedding bells.

558
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:17,504
Dave liked it and he's
gonna put a ring on it.

559
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:21,967
A bag of tissue.

560
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,593
What?
Scandalous.

561
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,803
It's gone.

562
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,346
Uh. He must have
packed the ring

563
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,764
last night before bed.

564
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,100
He's going to
propose to Samantha in Miami.

565
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,601
So you think we're
all gonna become, like,

566
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,186
one big happy family?

567
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,355
No one said happy.
No offense to your mom.

568
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,898
She actually seems
quite wonderful.

569
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:39,276
Yeah. It's you
we're not thrilled about.

570
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:40,652
Well, the feeling is mutual.

571
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,696
And you guys
can keep Dave too.

572
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:43,864
My dad died when I was little

573
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,282
and I've done
just fine without one.

574
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,201
Oh. I'm sorry, Miles.

575
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,287
Don't be. I didn't know him.

576
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,372
If Dave and my mom
do get married...

577
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:53,457
they'll wanna have
their own kids.

578
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,208
And you're not even
Dave's real sons...

579
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,376
you're just a bunch
of chipmunks

580
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,544
that he calls his kids.

581
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:58,628
Before you guys know it,

582
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,046
you'll be back
out in the forest.

583
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,174
Holding your nuts all winter.

584
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,258
Hey.

585
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,968
First of all,
that's what squirrels do.

586
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,470
We are chipmunks.

587
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,014
Um, Alvin,
chipmunks do that too.

588
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,974
And the fact that
I didn't know that...

589
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,227
is exactly why we cannot
end up back in the forest.

590
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:16,980
But... Dave wouldn't
do that to us.

591
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,064
He already has.

592
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,734
Why do you think you guys are
here and my mom's in Miami?

593
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,694
Meeting of the Munks.

594
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,697
I don't want Miles to be right
any more than you do,

595
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,324
but it all kind of lines up.

596
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:31,578
New job, new house,
new girlfriend, new family.

597
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,663
I don't want to go back
to the forest.

598
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,626
And I am definitely not going
to end up related to that guy.

599
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,254
Hmm. Nice form.

600
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:42,881
Here's the deal, Miles.

601
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,425
We all go to Miami
to stop this proposal...

602
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,595
and then we never have to
see each other again.

603
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:49,930
I'm in.

604
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,848
Can't get you chipmunks
out of my life fast enough.

605
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,808
That's the smartest thing
you've said

606
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,268
since we met you.

607
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,062
Are you sure there's

608
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,188
enough money
in your piggy bank?

609
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,773
Guys, it's a credit card.

610
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,608
We'll get 4 tickets.
Stop worrying.

611
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,068
Hello, boys.

612
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:04,361
Hey, Miss Price.

613
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:06,696
I'm supposed to be
keeping an eye on you...

614
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,074
so I think I'll use...

615
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,700
this one.

616
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,043
How are we gonna get to Miami
if she's gonna be watching us?

617
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,963
Guys, I have a plan.

618
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:26,299
The 4 words
society fears most.

619
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,718
I can't believe that worked.

620
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,303
It wasn't so much me

621
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,931
as it was the peanuts
dipped in cough syrup.

622
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,769
That's really messed up.

623
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,397
Respect.
Thank you!

624
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,566
Alvin, these aren't
even chipmunks.

625
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:43,733
They're squirrels.

626
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,318
Beggars
can't be choosers.

627
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,696
Besides, once we put them
in the shirts

628
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,656
from the Alvin, Simon
and Theodore dolls...

629
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,492
Miss Price won't be able to
tell the difference.

630
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,160
Yeah, let's do it.

631
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:56,580
Ooh, oh... I get to change me!

632
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,377
I can't believe
I maxed out my mom's

633
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,753
entire card
in this one ticket.

634
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,089
We're fine.
Just stick to the plan.

635
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:09,259
I'm starting to think I should
go through cargo with Theo.

636
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,343
Shh.

637
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,137
Be silent. Be still.

638
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,347
And you. Get in there.

639
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:15,515
Ow! Easy!

640
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:16,725
- Both of you guys.
- Watch the zipper.

641
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:17,809
Next!

642
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,769
Who knows what
you're carrying in this thing.

643
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:31,781
Go on through.

644
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,495
Whoa!

645
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,456
What's that?

646
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:43,627
That is a...
stuffed Alvin doll.

647
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:47,339
You know, from that lame
singing chipmunks group.

648
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,299
Um, yeah.

649
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,635
I'm gonna need to see what's
in that backpack, please.

650
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:52,802
Oh, no.

651
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,638
Yeah.

652
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,141
Um, it's just a doll.

653
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,643
Chucky was just a doll.

654
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:04,481
This is Alvin.
It's what the "A" is for.

655
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,318
He does a lot of bending
and back up.

656
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,362
He does splits.

657
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:13,990
He can twist.

658
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:18,328
Like Linda Blair almost.

659
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:21,247
You can use it
as a weight-loss device.

660
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,417
I can feel the sweat.

661
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,545
It even talks.

662
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:31,508
It says,
"I'm a dumb stupid-head."

663
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:39,516
Sorry, the batteries
might be a bit low.

664
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,434
Ow! I'm a dumb stupid-head!

665
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:43,895
So, he's... Ow!

666
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,231
And it bites.

667
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:47,899
I think that was just
a design flaw.

668
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,442
There's probably a recall.

669
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,362
You can put the doll
back in the bag.

670
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:54,906
Not the dark place!

671
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,074
What I am gonna need...

672
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,284
is for you to take a step
right over there...

673
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:01,705
because we're gonna need to
do a quick body search.

674
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:03,915
Body search?

675
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,125
Body search!

676
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,753
Good luck, Simon!
Yeah.

677
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,464
Okay.

678
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,717
Oh, no.

679
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,385
Where to hide, where to hide?

680
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,721
Relax.

681
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,431
Put your arms out.
They're out.

682
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,104
One last spot to get.

683
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,230
I don't wanna
go to jail.

684
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,732
I don't wanna go to jail!

685
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:39,659
That's not mine.

686
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,494
You just holding it
for a friend?

687
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,997
No, no,
not that, not that.

688
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,090
I don't get paid enough.

689
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,258
Get out of here.

690
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,010
<i>Real smooth, Simon.</i>

691
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,596
I'm sorry!
I just, I got so nervous.

692
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,722
You are lucky I don't flush

693
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:01,973
the both of you
down the toilet!

694
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,017
Well, I'm glad we sent
Theodore to Baggage.

695
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,603
He never would have
made it through Security.

696
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,606
Wow! Hi, everyone!

697
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,983
Cold in here, isn't it?

698
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,821
Whoa!

699
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,910
Miles, will you ask
a flight attendant

700
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,453
for some peanuts?
We're hungry.

701
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,330
Yeah. I too would
love a water.

702
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,540
But no ice.
It's supposed to be filthy.

703
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:28,625
Ooh, which reminds me.

704
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,709
Germs,
germs, go away,

705
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,085
don't come back
any other day, okay.

706
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,962
Shut up and stay out of sight.

707
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,172
Hey! Easy!

708
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:35,423
It smells in here.

709
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,343
If you're not gonna feed us,
I'm going to forage.

710
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,844
Not a great idea, Alvin.

711
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,805
We're not legitimate
passengers!

712
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,641
Ugh!

713
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:47,185
Oops! Sorry!

714
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:50,355
I didn't mean to startle you.

715
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,649
I'm not startled.

716
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,317
It's just you're...

717
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:55,485
you're you.

718
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:56,820
I am me.

719
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,988
And, you know,
if you have a pen...

720
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,783
I'm always happy to
sign an autograph for a fan.

721
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,495
I'm not a fan.

722
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,914
Okay.

723
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:12,502
Well, um, I'll be seeing you.

724
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,713
Excuse me! Pardon me!
Coming through.

725
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,717
Now where in this tin can
can I get some snacks?

726
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,856
Oh, baby!

727
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,904
Hi! I'm Theodore.

728
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:41,573
Shh.

729
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,241
Inside voice.

730
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:45,952
Please stop.

731
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,371
You're gonna make
the other animals nervous!

732
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,212
Uh, okay, I'll let you out.

733
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,715
But you have to promise
to go back in before we land.

734
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,970
Got it. There you go!

735
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,556
Oh! Thank you, friend.

736
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:13,104
Hey!

737
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,940
Please, everyone relax!

738
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:18,443
Um, Mister Monkey? Wha...

739
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,069
Wait! Don't do that.

740
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,488
No. Bad monkey!

741
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:24,824
I asked you to stop!

742
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:26,326
Hey! Please!

743
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,161
I'm begging you, Monkey Man!

744
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,088
What?

745
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,382
You've never seen a chipmunk
in first class before?

746
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,302
Uh, actually, I recently flew
next to The Chipettes

747
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:45,762
and they were ladies.

748
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,848
Hey. Don't judge me.
I saw <i>Pink Flamingos.</i>

749
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,100
Excuse me.
May I see your boarding pass?

750
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:54,771
Yeah, well,
funny thing about that.

751
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,147
Ha! Gotta run!

752
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,273
Come here.

753
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,027
Get back here!

754
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,447
Simon! Run!

755
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:05,657
Where? We're on a plane.

756
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,450
I don't know! Come on.

757
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,453
Freeze!

758
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:12,956
Air marshal.

759
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,624
Don't move.

760
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,543
Can we move now?

761
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:20,838
This is a very
hard pose to hold.

762
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:23,466
What's that?

763
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:25,969
Uh-oh.

764
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,971
This can't be good.

765
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:31,975
What the...

766
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:34,644
What? What?

767
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:36,938
All right!
Everybody calm down!

768
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,190
It's just a monkey. All right?

769
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:40,900
Birds! Birds!

770
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:45,697
Help! Someone save me!

771
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:47,156
Nice doggy...

772
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:49,534
Theo! Over here! Jump!

773
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:52,036
Birds and dogs!

774
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,830
Oh, my God!

775
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:55,540
Okay, now there's a goat.

776
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,002
And an otter.
And an otter! God!

777
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,295
<i>Uh, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is your captain speaking.</i>

778
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:02,380
Listen!

779
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:03,506
<i>We're going to be making an...</i>

780
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,550
<i>emergency landing</i>
<i>in Austin, Texas</i>

781
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:07,677
<i>due to a herd of</i>
<i>chinchillas in the cockpit.</i>

782
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,761
All right, you heard him!

783
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,388
The plane's going down.

784
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,851
Not down like down-down.

785
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,729
Safely-safely.
We're not crashing!

786
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,897
You people are idiots!

787
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,274
We're all gonna die!

788
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:22,442
What an idiot!

789
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,527
Oh, great speech, Churchill.

790
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,279
You better watch it!

791
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:27,822
Do you know who
you're talking to?

792
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:29,907
I am the police of the sky!

793
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:34,370
Really?

794
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:37,957
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Let's make sure</i>

795
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,208
<i>we have everything.</i>

796
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,793
You released animals
from cargo,

797
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,587
and then you forced
an emergency landing.

798
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,380
We also snuck onto the plane.

799
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,174
Uh-huh. That's right.
Theodore!

800
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,260
That is three major
infractions on one flight.

801
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,553
Here's a fun fact.

802
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,930
That's three more infractions
than I've ever had

803
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,432
in all my years
as an air marshal.

804
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,893
Congratulations on such
a distinguished career, sir.

805
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,020
Did you hear that?

806
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:01,272
Because of that
"distinguished career"...

807
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:03,107
I've got a meeting
with Homeland Security

808
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:04,275
next week about a promotion.

809
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,069
Another congratulations, sir.
Shut up!

810
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:07,153
What do you think
they're gonna bring up

811
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:08,362
when they interview me, huh?

812
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:11,699
My decade
of perfect service...

813
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,868
or that one time
that three chipmunks

814
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,079
turned my flight
into Noah's Ark?

815
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,289
Probably the time
with the chipmunks.

816
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:19,415
Yeah.

817
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,752
Um, I meant the other one.

818
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,338
Look, sir, what could
we possibly have done

819
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:26,672
to make you hate us so much?

820
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,969
I'll tell you what you did.

821
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:33,805
Whoa!

822
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:34,931
Holy Christmas.

823
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,810
I got a little
early gift for you.

824
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,478
Oh, James.

825
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:42,355
You shouldn't have.

826
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,481
No. Wait a second.

827
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,858
I want to Instagram
a video of your reaction.

828
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,361
Merry Christmas!
I'm breaking up with you!

829
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:49,612
What?

830
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:51,823
Thanks.

831
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,242
And The Chipmunks?

832
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,035
Grow up, James.

833
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,411
Wait.

834
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,800
Awkward.

835
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:14,428
You provided the soundtrack
to my heartbreak.

836
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,430
But now it's payback time.

837
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:20,476
I am putting you three on the
No-Fly List.

838
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:21,853
What? No!
But we have to get to Miami!

839
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:23,020
You can't do that!

840
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,189
You see, I'm an air marshal.

841
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,858
I'm all-powerful...

842
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,359
I'm all-seeing...

843
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:30,778
and I'm all-knowing.

844
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,196
Then you obviously know

845
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,865
you just made
that entire speech...

846
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,700
with your tie
in a cup of coffee.

847
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,119
Okay.

848
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,080
I'll be back in two minutes.

849
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:44,417
You also still have a little
parrot poop on your shirt.

850
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:45,585
10 minutes.

851
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:47,044
And one more thing.

852
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,005
Don't even think
about leaving.

853
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,716
I have a very particular
set of skills.

854
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:53,467
Skills that I have acquired
over a very long...

855
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,761
You just put your hand
on an ink pad.

856
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:00,725
15 minutes.

857
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:09,066
Whoa. That guy is the mayor
of Crazy Town.

858
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,736
We gotta get you out of here,
now. Let's go.

859
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,907
Oh, this is gonna be
the best...

860
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,621
- Come on!
- Really?

861
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:26,500
Nobody runs on
Agent James Suggs.

862
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:39,722
Come on. Come on. Go.

863
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:41,682
Here you go.
Thanks so much.

864
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,144
Well, that's as far
as my money takes us.

865
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:48,022
Which puts us 2 hours
and 30 minutes from Miami.

866
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:49,106
- Hey!
- Yes!

867
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,441
All right!
By plane.

868
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:52,026
Oh. Come on!

869
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:54,195
Guys, the party
is in three days.

870
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:56,447
We need to get to Miami. Fast.

871
00:35:57,281 --> 00:36:00,493
And, as if we're not in enough
trouble already, it's Dave.

872
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,953
Oh, man.

873
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,621
Well, we cannot
possibly pick up.

874
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:04,747
We have to pick up,

875
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,207
or Dave will know
something is wrong.

876
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:07,667
Dave's gonna know
something's wrong

877
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,710
when he sees us standing
around a bunch of trash cans,

878
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:12,129
in a parking lot
in the middle of nowhere!

879
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:13,506
Hmm. Good point.

880
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:15,883
Ready to go eat?

881
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,385
Uh... Yeah.

882
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:18,469
Everything okay?

883
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,012
Let me check on something.

884
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:21,847
Hello?

885
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,432
Hi, it's Dave. Are you busy?

886
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,017
<i>Oh, hi, Dave.</i>

887
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:26,769
No, I'm not busy at all.

888
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,814
No, I'm just dining
with a friend.

889
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:30,982
What do you need?

890
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,149
All right, I'm gonna
take a look.

891
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,276
I'm right at the window.

892
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,571
Oh, no!

893
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,325
They've eaten everything!

894
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,870
And I mean everything!

895
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,289
Yeah, that sounds about right.

896
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,666
Just like a guinea pig
Armageddon!

897
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,876
Well, thanks for checking
on them, Miss Price.

898
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,255
False alarm.

899
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:55,339
Sounds like
they're having a blast.

900
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:56,424
Oh, good.

901
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:57,800
You ready?
Yeah.

902
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:04,515
Um, Alvin, I think maybe we
should go somewhere else.

903
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:07,435
Whoa, hey. Sorry, fellas.
21 and over.

904
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:08,894
But it's dark outside,

905
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,438
and we don't have
anywhere else to go.

906
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:11,981
Well, I wish I could
help you out,

907
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,441
but I got a bar
packed with people...

908
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:14,817
waiting to hear a band

909
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,445
whose singer is stuck 50 miles
from here with a flat tire.

910
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,905
So, unless you guys know
anyone who can carry a tune...

911
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,490
I'm gonna have to
bid you good night.

912
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,910
How would you feel
about some singing chipmunks?

913
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:26,787
Whoa! You guys really
know The Chipettes?

914
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,247
Uh... Really?

915
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,082

you guys make a run for it.

Over here.

974
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,270
Gotcha!

975
00:39:58,606 --> 00:39:59,773
Ah!

976
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,195
Let me explain.

977
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:06,113
I have a reason to believe

978
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:09,492
there's a fugitive chipmunk
in your beard.

979
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,285
You don't think
I'd know if there was

980
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,787
an animal living in my beard?

981
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,540
I don't.
Beard peanuts?

982
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:17,708
Gotcha!

983
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,001
Uh-oh.

984
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:20,169
Ow!

985
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,130
Watch where
you're throwing people!

986
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:24,298
What are you
gonna do about it?

987
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,226
I am so sorry.

988
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:36,519
Yeah, sorry about the fight.

989
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,229
Ain't no apology necessary.

990
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,605
Nothing better for business

991
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,774
than a good old-fashioned
bar brawl.

992
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,400
Good luck, outlaws.
Thanks.

993
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,945
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, keep it in there!

994
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,281
Yikes!

995
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:17,977
Ha!

996
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:19,186
You come on!

997
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:30,739
I will slice and dice you
like spicy sushi roll!

998
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,204
Missed me!

999
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:38,289
Ha! Ha!

1000
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,541
You want some
butter with that?

1001
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,378
Drinks are on you!

1002
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,509
What?

1003
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:52,052
Ow, ow, ow...

1004
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,068
So long, Suggsy!

1005
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:11,989
Get out of the way,
hillbillies!

1006
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:14,617
I need to get out
of this bar ASAP!

1007
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:15,951
Hey, we gotta get out of here.

1008
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:17,036
But where's Alvin?

1009
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,162
We're gonna leave, man!

1010
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:20,205
I'm waiting on a guy
that owes me 76 bucks.

1011
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:21,582
Ah!

1012
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,542
You mean that guy?

1013
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:25,169
You know what,
we'll double it.

1014
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:26,253
All right.

1015
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:28,047
But Alvin's not here yet!
Forget about him, let's go!

1016
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,131
Wait, wait!

1017
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:30,257
There he is, there he is!

1018
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:31,383
You...

1019
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:32,676
Come on, let's go, come on!
Come on, Alvin!

1020
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,844
Hurry, hurry!

1021
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:35,054
Miles, give me your belt.

1022
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,056
You little hood rats!
Alvin, run!

1023
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,308
I will hunt you down!

1024
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:40,684
Slow down!

1025
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:41,852
Move your furry little feet!

1026
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:43,604
Alvin, let's go!
Hurry, Alvin!

1027
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:45,564
I will pounce on you!

1028
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:46,982
Alvin, jump!

1029
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:48,317
Hurry up, Alvin, come on!

1030
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:49,693
I will...

1031
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,071
Whoopsie.

1032
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:53,238
...take a little nap.

1033
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:58,285
So, how much
is this gonna cost?

1034
00:42:58,452 --> 00:43:00,663
To the nearest
bus station, $32.

1035
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:02,790
Oh,
we're a little short.

1036
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:04,041
How short?

1037
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,292
About 32 bucks.

1038
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,466
Have a nice night.

1039
00:43:14,051 --> 00:43:15,344
Easy for you to say.

1040
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:17,846
You're not the one
who has to sleep outside!

1041
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:20,432
Thanks for nothing!
Drive safely!

1042
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,351
What?

1043
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,436
I hope he gets home safe.

1044
00:43:26,188 --> 00:43:27,189
Ouch!

1045
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:30,234
I got
a splinter in my tail.

1046
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:31,402
Ow!

1047
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,862
Ow!

1048
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:37,741
I can't sleep
without my pillow.

1049
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:39,118
Ow!

1050
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:40,244
I don't suppose they make

1051
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:42,663
Tempur-Pedic tree branches,
do they?

1052
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:45,082
Seriously, guys?

1053
00:43:45,249 --> 00:43:46,291
You're the ones who
are supposed to be

1054
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,127
comfortable sleeping in trees,
not me.

1055
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,003
We're not talking to you,
okay?

1056
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,089
Not after you tried
to leave me behind!

1057
00:43:52,256 --> 00:43:53,841
First, awesome, because

1058
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:55,801
I don't wanna
talk to you either.

1059
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:59,138
And second, you guys would've
done the same thing to me.

1060
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:02,725
No, Miles, we actually
would have waited for you.

1061
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,685
Yeah, we're in this together.

1062
00:44:04,852 --> 00:44:07,730
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us.

1063
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,440
I've heard your lame
family motto, man.

1064
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:10,607
It's a bunch of crap.

1065
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:12,609
People look out
for themselves.

1066
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,486
It's biology,
it's what animals do.

1067
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:17,239
Well, on behalf of
animals everywhere...

1068
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:19,199
I find your
attitude insulting.

1069
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:21,577
Call it whatever you want,
man. It's true.

1070
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:23,495
What, you think my dad was

1071
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:24,788
thinking about anyone
other than himself...

1072
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:26,290
when he left me and my mom?

1073
00:44:26,457 --> 00:44:27,499
But, I...

1074
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:30,043
I thought you said
your dad was...

1075
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:36,633
Right, um...

1076
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:41,555
He might as well have.
He left when I was only five.

1077
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,682
Sorry, Miles.

1078
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:44,767
Whatever.

1079
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:47,436
I don't care, you know?

1080
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:50,773
I've done just fine
without him.

1081
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:52,232
Miles, listen.

1082
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:54,943
If Dave and your mom
end up together...

1083
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,779
he's a good person.

1084
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,697
He would never bail on you.

1085
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:01,742
Then why are you
making this trip?

1086
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:05,537
Right.

1087
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:08,749
Because you think
he's gonna ditch you, too.

1088
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:14,171
Look, dads are overrated.

1089
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:18,342
Eventually, you will
get over him leaving.

1090
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,053
Really?

1091
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:24,598

00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:34,379
It was pretty crazy.

1290
00:53:34,546 --> 00:53:36,297
Even that Suggs guy
hung out with us.

1291
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:38,258
Yeah, he's not
that bad after all.

1292
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:40,051
Hey, we missed
a call from Dave.

1293
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,012
And a text.

1294
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:43,930
27 of them.

1295
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:45,181
Uh-oh.

1296
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:46,266
Oh, no.

1297
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:52,605
Where am I?

1298
00:53:53,565 --> 00:53:54,691
What is this?

1299
00:53:58,528 --> 00:53:59,821
Suggs!
Who are you?

1300
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:02,657
It's Vitto,
the band's manager, remember?

1301
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:04,868
The only thing I remember

1302
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:08,163
is being attacked
by a trombone.

1303
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:09,414
Oh, right, yeah.

1304
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:11,291
You got that crazy bump
on your head.

1305
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:12,625
You didn't care, though.

1306
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,794
You just wanted to party!

1307
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:18,006
We hit every jazz club
in the Quarter.

1308
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:21,426
What do you mean, "We"?

1309
00:54:21,593 --> 00:54:25,055
You, me, and those
dope chipmunk dudes!

1310
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:32,896
I partied with
those tree-skunks?

1311
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:35,940
They're the ones who dared you
to get that sassy tattoo!

1312
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:39,486
What? What?

1313
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,784
How could I have let them
talk me into this?

1314
00:54:46,076 --> 00:54:47,994
Oh, no.
You asked for that one.

1315
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:50,205
The other one was their idea.

1316
00:54:52,874 --> 00:54:54,542
What "other one"?

1317
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:57,670
What?

1318
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,935
This is where they told us
to meet them, right?

1319
00:55:12,102 --> 00:55:14,437
Well, yelled at us
to meet them.

1320
00:55:14,604 --> 00:55:16,314
Hopefully they had time to
cool off on the plane.

1321
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:17,774
There you are.

1322
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:18,817
Dave!
Dave!

1323
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,401
Mom!
Don't "Dave, Mom" us.

1324
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:21,486
You know what, Dave?

1325
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:23,071
You're an artist,
and you're emotional...

1326
00:55:23,196 --> 00:55:24,656
and you follow your heart,
but maybe

1327
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:26,157
I should take
the lead on this one.

1328
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:27,367
You know,
we keep a level head.

1329
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,827
Throw them a little Good Cop.

1330
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:30,620
Okay.
Okay.

1331
00:55:31,663 --> 00:55:32,831
Don't you "Dave, Mom" us.

1332
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,375
Do you have any idea
how terrifying it is...

1333
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:37,085
to find out that your children
are 2,000 miles

1334
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:38,461
away from where
they're supposed to be?

1335
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:40,046
You are lucky that
there are witnesses,

1336
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,673
because I am
so mad right now...

1337
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,258
that I could just spit!
Okay, okay.

1338
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:44,634
Right here, on this floor!

1339
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:47,345
Okay, okay. Nice Good Cop.

1340
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:50,390
Dave, I swear, it wasn't as
crazy as it looked on TV.

1341
00:55:50,557 --> 00:55:51,599
Oh, really?

1342
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:52,934
Well, let me just
pull up some of

1343
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,727
Theodore's tweets
from last night.

1344
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,105
"Only one word
to describe this night,

1345
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:59,232
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy."

1346
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:00,859
Or, "If you wanna get crazy,

1347
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:02,443
"go to New Orleans.
It's the craziest."

1348
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,654
Or, "In a New Orleans
Jazz Parade,

1349
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:05,864
"so crazy."

1350
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,073
We're really sorry, Dave.

1351
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,908
Sorry's not gonna
cut it this time, guys.

1352
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:10,994
If it were up to me,
we'd be going home,

1353
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:12,662
but I gotta get back to Miami.

1354
00:56:13,163 --> 00:56:15,456
Do not smile.
You guys are grounded in Miami

1355
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,708
and also when
we get back to LA.

1356
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:18,793
When are we
not grounded?

1357
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:20,837
You'll be so old,
your fur will be gray.

1358
00:56:21,004 --> 00:56:22,297
Yeah, that goes for
your fur too, Miles.

1359
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,590
I don't have fur.

1360
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:24,757
Well, whatever you have
is grounded...

1361
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:26,301
for a long time. Let's go.

1362
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:29,179
Huh. They didn't
kill us after all.

1363
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:30,430
Feels like a win.

1364
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:33,266
Hey, guys, Operation
"No Proposal" is still on.

1365
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:34,893
Yeah!
All right!

1366
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:37,103
High... Oh, fist.

1367
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,063
Give me some.
Ow!

1368
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:40,190
Oh, sorry.
Take it easy!

1369
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:41,399
- Guys, come on.
- Jeez.

1370
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:42,483
Yeah.

1371
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:45,320
Here you go.
Thank you.

1372
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,030
You're welcome.
And may I see your ID, please?

1373
00:56:47,197 --> 00:56:48,198
Yes.

1374
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,325
Thank you.

1375
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:51,618
Hey, um...

1376
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:53,411
Are you sure about this?

1377
00:56:53,578 --> 00:56:55,496
Because if this
three-ring circus

1378
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,248
is too scary for you,
I totally get it...

1379
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:59,250
and we could just
go back to LA.

1380
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:00,960
I mean, you wouldn't be
the first guy

1381
00:57:01,044 --> 00:57:03,546
to head for the hills once
we showed our crazy cards.

1382
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:05,548
Please, your circus
only has one ring.

1383
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:07,133
Stop looking at me.

1384
00:57:07,217 --> 00:57:08,259
Mine's
the three-ringer.

1385
00:57:08,343 --> 00:57:09,385
You're the one
who should think

1386
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:10,553
about heading for the hills.

1387
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:12,931
I'm not going anywhere.

1388
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,515
Except to get us a coffee.

1389
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:16,392
I'll meet you at the gate.

1390
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:18,478
Sir?

1391
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,230
Is there a problem?

1392
00:57:20,313 --> 00:57:21,606
Problem? What problem?

1393
00:57:21,773 --> 00:57:23,024
There sure is.

1394
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:26,611
Oh, man.
Oh, right.

1395
00:57:26,778 --> 00:57:28,029
Whoopsies.
That.

1396
00:57:28,196 --> 00:57:29,197
Guys.

1397
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,573
Oh, nuts.

1398
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:38,414
Seriously, guys,
the No-Fly List? Come on!

1399
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:40,375
At least we're not
on the No-Drive List.

1400
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,752
There's no such thing
as a No-Drive List, Theodore.

1401
00:57:42,919 --> 00:57:44,837
I'm sure you guys will
find a way to start one.

1402
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:46,756
Let's not overreact, Dave.

1403
00:57:46,923 --> 00:57:48,132
The only reason we left home
in the first place...

1404
00:57:48,216 --> 00:57:50,218
Guys, not now, okay?

1405
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:52,929
I worked my butt off

1406
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:55,181
on Ashley's album,
and because of you three...

1407
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:57,475
I might not even get to
the record release!

1408
00:57:57,767 --> 00:58:00,520
Not to mention, you've ruined
this trip for me and Samantha.

1409
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:03,106
It's just, when you took
Samantha to Miami...

1410
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,691
Theodore, I'm not
in the mood to hear it.

1411
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:06,025
But Dave, we don't...

1412
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:08,403
Alvin, don't.
You'll just make it worse.

1413
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:13,324
Thank you for nothing.

1414
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:16,160
Agent Suggs, Air Marshal.

1415
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:17,287
I'll be with you
in a moment, sir.

1416
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,163
Okay, you're gonna
regret that.

1417
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:34,262
Did you help three chipmunks
get their rental car today?

1418
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:35,722
Yeah, they came in.

1419
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:37,724
With some guy,
probably their dad.

1420
00:58:38,016 --> 00:58:39,809
Probably not their dad,
because he's a human...

1421
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:41,644
and they're chipmunks!
Hey!

1422
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:44,564
Families come in all
shapes and sizes, sir.

1423
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:45,815
It's not for me to judge.

1424
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:47,191
We don't do that here,
at Miss Bee's.

1425
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:49,068
Okay, this is how
it's gonna go down...

1426
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:50,570
I need you to go back there,

1427
00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:53,406
and get me the GPS information
for that rental car.

1428
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:55,992
We don't track
our rental cars, sir.

1429
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:57,660
Oh! Is that so?

1430
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:00,872
I work for the United States
government...

1431
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:03,124
and we pretty much
track everything.

1432
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:04,834
I know what you had
for lunch today.

1433
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:06,753
Falafel!

1434
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:08,296
Now scurry back there,

1435
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:09,797
and get me the frequency

1436
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:11,799
and uplink code
from that rental car.

1437
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:13,760
Hey!

1438
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,430
And I need the fastest set
of wheels you've got!

1439
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:25,980
Are you kidding me right now?

1440
00:59:26,356 --> 00:59:27,523
Do you know what this is?

1441
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,817
This is a roller skate
with wheels.

1442
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:31,569
Pretty sure roller skates
come with wheels.

1443
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:32,653
Ah!

1444
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,034
It's like Tweety Bird!

1445
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:39,952

a 200-mile head start.

1449
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:56,469
Time to roll up
some road, Suggs.

a little snack to get me
from lunch to dinner.

Don't be mad, Dave.

Hey, Dave!

1498
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:39,989
We'd like to do
the mature thing...

1499
01:01:40,156 --> 01:01:41,908
and accept
partial responsibility

1500

for all the trouble
we've caused.

Yeah.

out of my sight
for even a second...

1506
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:55,796
Samantha and I have dinner
plans that I can't get out of.

1507
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:57,715
So if anything happens,
we'll be at the villa.

1508
01:01:57,882 --> 01:01:59,300
Ooh, romantic.

1509

01:02:03,638 --> 01:02:05,681
All right, you are
not to leave this room.

1512
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:07,350
Do you understand, young man?
Yeah.

1513
01:02:07,517 --> 01:02:09,310
You guys don't
have to worry about us.

1514
01:02:09,477 --> 01:02:11,729
We'll be on our
best behavior tonight.

1515
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:13,231
I promise. Whoa.

1516
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:14,565
I know you will,
because I hired

1517
01:02:14,649 --> 01:02:16,025
a babysitter to keep
an eye on you.

1518
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:17,318
What? Come on.
Oh, man.

1519
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:18,903
We'll be home after the party.

1520
01:02:22,907 --> 01:02:24,325
Almost forgot this.

1521
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:32,875
Dave is going
to propose tonight.

1522
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,168
What gave that away?

1523
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:35,836
The romantic dinner
or the engagement ring?

1524
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:37,588
Alvin, what are we
going to do?

1525
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:39,340
Absolutely nothing.

1526
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:40,925
What?
Alvin's right.

1527
01:02:41,092 --> 01:02:43,219
This hasn't been so bad.

1528
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:46,013
Maybe we just...

1529
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:47,848
do nothing.
"Nothing"?

1530
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:51,185
Guys, "nothing" isn't a plan!
We can't do "nothing."

1531
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:52,520
Sure we can.

1532

without this.

Alvin!
When did you grab it?

1534
01:02:57,358 --> 01:02:59,610
I found it in his bag,
five minutes ago.

1535
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,696

1536

No, it's South Beach.

1585
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,024
Theodore, you saved my life.

1586
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:05,152
Like we always say,
you mess with one of us...

1587
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,697
Don't make me say it, man,
it's so lame.

1588
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:09,907
Miles, he got hit
by a car for you.

1589
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:12,284
You mess with all of us.
All right!

1590
01:05:12,368 --> 01:05:14,537
Whoo-hoo! Oh, ouch!

1591
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:17,081
Miles, we are so sorry.

1592
01:05:17,248 --> 01:05:20,084
We haven't been fair to you
from day one.

1593
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:21,544
And the truth is...

1594
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:25,214
you'd make a great brother.

1595
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:26,340
Yeah!

1596
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:28,926
I feel the same
about you guys.

1597
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:31,429
So, I guess we're going to be
family after all.

Except for one tiny detail...

1599
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:35,015
By stealing the ring,

1600
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:37,184
we've effectively

You're right.

1602
01:05:38,436 --> 01:05:41,689
We need to get that ring,
and get to that restaurant!

1603
01:05:41,856 --> 01:05:43,357
Let's do it. Come on.

1604
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:50,281

Yes!

01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:58,372
I really
wanna go with you...

1609
01:05:58,706 --> 01:05:59,749
but I'm stuck babysitting.

1610
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:00,958
Aw, man. The babysitter.

1611
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,210
I hope when they get here,
they're not annoying.

1612
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:05,045
Let's go.
Like, this last time...

1613
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:07,256
I had a kid,
and he was, like...

1614
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:09,383
"Oh, my gosh, can I have
yogurt?" And I was like...

1615
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:11,010
"Oh, my gosh,
can you go to sleep?"

1616
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:12,136
I don't think
she knows we're here.

1617
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:13,304
I was like, "Ridiculous."

1618
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:14,764
I don't think
she knows she's here.

1619
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:17,433
This really sucks,
when you're so responsible,

1620
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:19,602
and, like, everyone
around you is so not.

1621
01:06:19,769 --> 01:06:21,896
You know what I mean?
It's like, it's hard.

1622
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:23,564
Oh, there you are.

1623
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:24,982
Well, okay, I'm totally
texting you right now.

1624
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:26,650
Hold on, let me
send you this picture.

1625
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:29,820
He's, like, super cute.
I really like him.

1626
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:31,739
Come on! Let's go.
Aw, I know.

1627
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:33,908
What are you talking about?
I like that he's hairy.

1628
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:35,576
Oh? Hairy, you say?

1629
01:06:35,743 --> 01:06:36,911
Yeah, scruffy's, like, cute.

1630
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:41,123
It's like, "Hi, I am adorable,
but I'm also an animal."

1631
01:06:41,749 --> 01:06:43,083
You know? Yeah, I know.

1632
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,085
Oh, yeah, right. Miles!
We're on our way.

1633
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:46,420
Yeah, I know he's
a little short, but

1634
01:06:46,504 --> 01:06:48,005
I don't know, you know
that famous saying...

1635
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,423
Theo! Come on! Let's go!

1636
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:50,841
"little things come in big
packages," or whatever.

1637
01:06:50,925 --> 01:06:52,009
Oh, man.
It's like that.

1638
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:54,094
I think
she liked me.

1639
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:55,638
I, like, could be
doing so many more

1640
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:57,097
important things right now.

1641
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:59,517
I could be, I don't know,
getting a pedicure?

1642
01:07:00,601 --> 01:07:03,187
I'm looking for
some chipmunks.

1643
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,608
Guys, their reservation
was at 8:00.

1644
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:10,277
So, we still might have time
to save the proposal.

1645
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:12,238
Come on, let's go. Go!

1646
01:07:12,321 --> 01:07:13,322
Listen to me,

1647
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:14,406
I know these chipmunks
are here.

1648
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:15,991
This is a badge for the United
States government, okay?

1649
01:07:16,075 --> 01:07:17,034
Okay, guys,
here's the plan...

1650
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:18,786
- So, I need for you...
- Oh, no. It's Suggs!

1651
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:20,204
He found us.

1652
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:22,206
Theodore, get up!
Uh-oh!

1653
01:07:22,623 --> 01:07:24,375
Miles, you gotta get
the ring to Dave!

1654
01:07:24,542 --> 01:07:25,668
I'm not leaving you guys.

1655
01:07:25,835 --> 01:07:27,378
We'll distract him. Just go!

1656
01:07:27,545 --> 01:07:28,546
Run, run!

1657
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:29,839
Theo! Hurry!
Get back here!

1658
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:31,674
I'm going
as fast as I can!

1659
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:33,467
Think of donuts,
think of donuts!

1660
01:07:33,634 --> 01:07:35,469
Donuts? Whoo-hoo!

1661
01:07:35,845 --> 01:07:36,887
Go, Miles, go!
Hurry!

1662
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:38,222
Run, run!

1663
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:39,557
Hide over here!
Where?

1664
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,725
I don't know!
Just think of something!

1665
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:52,653
Come on. Where are you?

1666
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:54,363
Where are you?

1667
01:07:58,492 --> 01:07:59,535
Come on.

1668
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:02,079
Come on. Come on.

1669
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:16,886
Hi...ya.

1670
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:18,220
See ya!

1671
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:24,476
Go, go, go!

1672
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,603
Run, run!

1673
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:27,730
Hurry, hurry! He's coming!

1674
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:30,232
Hurry, Alvin. Hit the button!

1675
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,026
Come on, Alvin! Hurry, hurry!

1676
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,111
Whew!

1677
01:08:34,612 --> 01:08:35,613
Ha!

1678
01:08:37,698 --> 01:08:40,618
Here's Suggsy!

1679
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,119
He's like the Terminator!
Yeah!

1680
01:08:44,914 --> 01:08:45,915
Oh, no.

1681
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:47,583
This is ironic.

1682
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:49,585
We're gonna be going up...

1683
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:52,087
but I'm taking you boys down.

1684
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,716
Now, here's what's
gonna happen...

1685
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,135
I'm gonna turn you over
to Homeland Security...

1686
01:08:58,302 --> 01:08:59,553
and they're gonna put you
in a zoo prison

1687
01:08:59,637 --> 01:09:00,763
for dangerous animals.

1688
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:01,889
Oh, no.

1689
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:03,933
And then, if you ever
get out of there...

1690
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:06,101
I'm gonna pay someone to
have you stuffed.

1691
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:07,186
Right.

1692
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:09,480
And I'm gonna give you
as a gift to Anna,

1693
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:11,315
who will hopefully
take me back.

1694
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:14,109
Dude, I'm sorry,
but it's over.

1695
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:16,070
You don't know that.
Theo, let's go.

1696
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:17,529
I just think there's something
wrong with her phone

1697
01:09:17,613 --> 01:09:18,614
and she's not getting
my texts...

1698
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:20,658
or the flowers,
or my candy grams.

1699
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:22,409
And I, personally,
don't think it's uncommon...

1700
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:23,619
for someone to move
five times a year

1701
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:24,745
and change their number.

1702
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:26,455
Okay? It's normal.

1703
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,249
Oh, yeah. Totally normal.

1704
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:30,417
Alvin!

1705
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:31,543
What? What's going on?

1706
01:09:31,627 --> 01:09:33,087
And that's our cue to leave.

1707
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:35,923
It has been a treat.

1708
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:37,174
No... What are you doing?

1709
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:38,592
Elevator power off.

1710
01:09:39,093 --> 01:09:40,803
No! No!

1711
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:53,440
Excuse me!

1712
01:09:53,607 --> 01:09:54,608
Pardon me!

1713
01:09:54,692 --> 01:09:55,693
Miles!

1714
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:57,861
Hey. What happened to
Officer Dingleberry?

1715
01:09:58,028 --> 01:10:00,447
Let's just say
his elevator got stuck.

1716
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:01,782
Has Dave proposed yet?

1717
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:04,034
No, but they're on dessert.
It can't be long.

1718
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:05,285
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

1719
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:06,620
Oh, okay.

1720
01:10:08,372 --> 01:10:09,373
You remember what to do?

1721
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:10,624
Yes, sir. Be no problem.
There's the box.

1722
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:12,626
It's go time.
Excuse me...

1723
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:14,461
young man, we have a strict

1724
01:10:14,545 --> 01:10:16,463
no pets policy
at this restaurant.

1725
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,882
I'm going to have to ask you
to take your meerkats home.

1726
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,050
Meerkats!

1727
01:10:20,134 --> 01:10:21,135
Esteban.

1728
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:23,887
Please escort these things
out of the restaurant.

1729
01:10:23,971 --> 01:10:25,347
All right, all right.

1730
01:10:25,514 --> 01:10:28,058
Come on, guys.
We know when we're not wanted.

1731
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:30,144
Evasive maneuvers! Nutmeg!

1732
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:31,770
He shoots, he scores!
Nice, Alvin!

1733
01:10:31,854 --> 01:10:33,105
Go, Alvin, go!

1734
01:10:33,188 --> 01:10:35,399
Did you hear that?
It sounded like somebody
yelled "Alvin."

1735
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:36,483
Alley-oop!

1736
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:38,736
Whoo-hoo!

1737
01:10:39,194 --> 01:10:40,237
Pardon me!

1738
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,363
I think you're imagining it.

1739
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:42,781
- Alvin!
- I'm open!

1740
01:10:42,865 --> 01:10:43,907
Or not.

1741
01:10:48,746 --> 01:10:49,747
Oh!

1742
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:00,257
Gotcha!

1743
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:01,884
Whoo-hoo! Cold!

1744
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:03,677
Whoa!

1745
01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:05,846
Alvin?

1746
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:07,848
Oh. Hi there, Dave.

1747
01:11:08,891 --> 01:11:11,268
Don't say it. Resist the urge.

1748
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:13,687
We all know you wanna say it,
but hear me out.

1749
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:15,230
Miles? What?

1750
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:16,356
We can explain everything.

1751
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,900
Well, I can't wait
to hear this.

1752
01:11:18,525 --> 01:11:19,568
Dave, we came to Miami

1753
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,111
to stop you two
from getting engaged.

1754
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:25,115
Oh, no.

1755
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:27,785
I just blew the surprise.

1756
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:30,537
But, and this is the part that
I'd like you to focus on...

1757
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:33,123
when Theodore
got hit by a car...

1758
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,708
Theodore got hit by a car?

1759
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:35,876
I did.

1760
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:38,420
He's fine. He was
saving Miles' life.

1761
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:39,630
Wait, he what?

1762
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:42,466
The point is,
we realized that...

1763
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:44,968
we like the idea of
you two being together,

1764
01:11:45,052 --> 01:11:46,637
and we changed our minds.

1765
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,721
Yep.

1766
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:49,932
It might not be
the family in the photo

1767
01:11:50,057 --> 01:11:51,433
that comes with the frame...

1768
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,062
but it's gonna be our family.
And we're proud of it.

1769
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,898
Guys, that ring isn't mine.

1770
01:11:58,065 --> 01:12:01,110
So, you're not proposing?

1771
01:12:02,611 --> 01:12:04,988
I'm sorry, Samantha. I'm not.

1772
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:06,240
Oh, thank God.

1773
01:12:06,782 --> 01:12:07,950
I mean,
that's not what I meant.

1774
01:12:08,117 --> 01:12:09,243
You know. I mean, not that

1775
01:12:09,326 --> 01:12:10,452
I couldn't see it
happening someday.

1776
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:12,371
I mean, uh... Not that
I'm expecting it to happen.

1777
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:13,914
But I mean,
if it did happen...

1778
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:15,499
I'm spiraling, aren't I?

1779
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:17,334
A little.
What I mean is...

1780
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:22,005
I would love it if we could
just take our time because...

1781
01:12:22,172 --> 01:12:24,341
I really want it to work.

1782
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:26,343
Me, too.

1783
01:12:27,928 --> 01:12:30,097
I'm very
confused right now.

1784
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:32,432
You brought this ring to Miami

1785
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:35,269
and you said you had to
come to dinner, so...

1786
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:37,437
I was holding it for Barry.

1787
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:39,106
My sound engineer.

1788
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:41,191
He's proposing to
his girlfriend, Alice,

1789
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:42,693
at the restaurant right now...

1790
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,653
with an empty ring box.
Oh, my God.

1791
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:45,821
Will you marry me?

1792
01:12:45,988 --> 01:12:48,323
It's not empty.

1793
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:54,621
A breath mint?

1794
01:13:10,179 --> 01:13:11,346
Miss Grey, over here.

1795
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:12,556
When are you
going back on tour?

1796
01:13:13,182 --> 01:13:15,475
The greenroom is
right this way, Mr. Seville.

1797
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,104
The only reason
we're not headed

1798
01:13:19,188 --> 01:13:20,480
back to LA right now
is because...

1799
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:21,982
I have to be here.

1800
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:25,152
As soon as the show is over,
we're all going home.

1801
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:28,906
I don't think I've ever been
more disappointed

1802
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:30,657
in you guys
than I am right now.

1803
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,623
If Dave didn't wanna
get rid of us before,

1804
01:13:37,706 --> 01:13:39,249
he definitely does now.

1805
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:42,586
All because we only cared
about if we were happy.

1806
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:45,005
Maybe it's a chipmunk thing,
like hoarding, you know?

1807
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:46,840
Maybe we're
emotional hoarders?

1808
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,300
Actually, chipmunks are

1809
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:50,010
traditionally
very caring creatures.

1810
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:53,055
Oh, nuts.
Well, that means it's us.

1811
01:13:53,222 --> 01:13:55,182
I'd do anything to fix this.

1812
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:59,186
Wait. Maybe we can fix it.

1813
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:01,855
By doing the one thing
we do best!

1814
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:03,523
Cause mischief on
land, sea and air?

1815
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:04,858
Eat all of Dave's food?

1816
01:14:05,025 --> 01:14:06,526
No! Music!

1817
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:08,528
When words aren't enough,
we sing!

1818
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,697
So let's give Dave
one last song

1819
01:14:10,781 --> 01:14:13,200
to show him
how we really feel about him.

1820
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:15,577
Miles, start working on
that little country riff

1821
01:14:15,702 --> 01:14:16,787
you were doing in Texas.

1822
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:18,622
Where are you going?
There's so much to do.

1823
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,123
I need to talk to Wardrobe,
we need to...

1824
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,750
If we are gonna
bring down the house,

1825
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,627
we're gonna need some backup.

I need your help.

1841

We really screwed up with Dave
and we gotta fix it.

1842

Before we perform,

1853
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:45,167
my brothers and I have
a few things to set straight.

1854
01:15:45,792 --> 01:15:46,793
Earlier this evening...

1855
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,672
we accidentally ruined
a very special evening...

1856
01:15:50,839 --> 01:15:52,841
for a very special woman

1857
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:54,760
and we'd like to
make it up to her.

1858
01:15:54,843 --> 01:15:55,886
Yeah.

1859
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:57,012
Alice?

1860
01:15:57,179 --> 01:15:59,139
Barry has something
he'd like to ask you.

1861
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:00,307
Again.

1862
01:16:05,645 --> 01:16:07,147
Will you marry me this time?

1863
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:08,857
Yes.

1864
01:16:09,149 --> 01:16:10,150

Thanks, Chipmunks.

1867
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:21,328

quick thing to say.

without telling you.

1922
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:45,365
We just didn't wanna lose you.

1923
01:19:45,699 --> 01:19:46,700
Lose me?

1924
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:48,702
Why would you guys ever think
you were gonna lose me?

1925
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,704
Because you said
you're starting

1926
01:19:50,787 --> 01:19:52,247
a new chapter in your life.

1927
01:19:52,414 --> 01:19:54,708
We thought you might
bail on us.

1928
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:56,918
Technically,
we're not even a family.

1929
01:19:57,085 --> 01:19:58,878
We're just three chipmunks
who live with you.

1930
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:01,548
Is that what you guys think?

1931
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:03,258
I mean, I know I haven't

1932
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:05,218
really been around much
lately, and...

1933
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:07,053
things are changing for us,

1934
01:20:07,137 --> 01:20:08,888
but I'd never
bail on you guys.

1935
01:20:09,264 --> 01:20:11,057
Because we are a family.

1936
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:13,810
You're stuck with me
whether you like it or not.

1937
01:20:16,396 --> 01:20:18,398
And I was probably
a little over-the-top

1938
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:20,567
on the whole
"no music" thing, okay?

1939
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:22,444
You guys can perform.
All right!

1940
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,112
But locally. Okay?

1941
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:25,280
Sure!

1942
01:20:25,572 --> 01:20:28,241
And I promise to be a better
dad from here on out.

1943
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:30,577
What are you
talking about, Dave?

1944
01:20:30,744 --> 01:20:33,747
You're the best dad
we could ever have.

1945
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:36,458
What do you say to
a little family dinner

1946
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:37,667
when we get home?

1947
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,252
You know, so we know where

1948
01:20:39,336 --> 01:20:41,004
our kids are the entire time
we're together?

1949
01:20:41,171 --> 01:20:42,380
That sounds perfect.

1950
01:20:42,464 --> 01:20:43,840
Whoo-hoo! We rocked it!

1951
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:47,260
Simon, did you see me?
I was on fire! Oh.

1952
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:49,054
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

1953
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:50,930
but I had fun getting
in trouble with you guys.

1954
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:52,682
The trip might be over,

1955
01:20:52,766 --> 01:20:54,184
but as long as
Alvin is around,

1956
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:55,769
we'll always get into trouble.

1957
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:57,604
Thanks, Si!
Not a compliment.

1958
01:20:57,937 --> 01:21:00,023
Oh, my God,
you guys were awesome.

1959
01:21:00,648 --> 01:21:01,649
Hey, Miles, right?

1960
01:21:02,776 --> 01:21:04,319
Wow, you played great!

1961
01:21:04,486 --> 01:21:06,029
Thanks! Your cool song...

1962
01:21:06,196 --> 01:21:10,367
I mean... I love when...
Music with your mouth...

1963
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:11,993
Oh, brother.
Uh...

1964
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:14,954
You're great.
Thank you.

1965
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:16,289
Phew! She bought it.

1966
01:21:16,456 --> 01:21:18,249
Anyways, I have this party

1967
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:20,710
I'm supposed to go to
in L.A. Saturday night...

1968
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:21,920
if, um, maybe you'd wanna...

1969
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:23,004
Definitely, yeah.

1970
01:21:23,171 --> 01:21:24,381
I'd, definitely
would like to...

1971
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:25,965
Yes. Definitely.
Oh.

1972
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:28,009
Okay. Well then
I'll definitely,

1973
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:29,886
definitely see you there.

1974
01:21:30,053 --> 01:21:31,054
Okay.

1975
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:33,181
Bye.
Bye.

1976
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:35,558
Smooth, Miles.

1977
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:37,811
Real smooth.

1978
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:39,145
Bye.

1979
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:41,231
All right!
Hey, ready?

1980
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:42,399
Yeah.

1981
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:43,566
Bye, guys.

1982
01:21:45,235 --> 01:21:46,820
Come on, guys. Let's go home.

1983
01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:50,490
Should we remind him we're
on the No-Fly List?

1984
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:52,492
Definitely not.

1985
01:22:08,383 --> 01:22:10,135
Um,
this doesn't look like home.

1986
01:22:10,218 --> 01:22:11,219
It's not.

1987
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:12,345
We have one more
important thing

1988
01:22:12,429 --> 01:22:13,721
to do before we go home.

1989
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:16,391
Oh, Dave, we've been
driving for three days!

1990
01:22:16,558 --> 01:22:17,559
Can't it wait?

1991
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:19,144
Unfortunately not, boys.

1992
01:22:19,227 --> 01:22:20,603
The courthouse
is closed tomorrow.

1993
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:22,689
I'm sorry, the what house?

1994
01:22:23,523 --> 01:22:25,024
Are we going to jail?

1995
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:26,901
We didn't mean to cause an
emergency landing, Dave!

1996
01:22:27,068 --> 01:22:28,528
It was freezing in cargo!

1997
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:32,532
Does this look like a face
that will survive prison?

1998
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:35,535
Come on.

1999
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,663
Dave Seville?

2000
01:22:38,746 --> 01:22:39,747
Yep, that's me.

2001
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:41,291
By signing this...

2002
01:22:41,374 --> 01:22:43,710
you not only agree
to take care of,

2003
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:45,086
but to provide for the health,

2004
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:46,629
welfare and
educational needs...

2005
01:22:46,796 --> 01:22:48,548
of Alvin, Simon and Theodore.

2006
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,091
I do.

2007
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:52,886
Alvin, Simon and Theodore,
do you agree to this adoption?

2008
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:54,220
Adoption?

2009
01:22:54,554 --> 01:22:56,598
That's why we're here?

2010
01:22:57,557 --> 01:22:59,726
You're adopting us?

2011
01:22:59,893 --> 01:23:00,935
You guys were right.

2012
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:03,980
Even though you consider me
to be your dad, and...

2013
01:23:04,147 --> 01:23:06,608
I love you like my own sons,
it's never been official.

2014
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:08,443
So I figured...

2015
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:10,236
let's make it official.

2016
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,411
Chipmunks?

2017
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:19,746
Yes?

2018
01:23:21,414 --> 01:23:24,042
I still need you to say
something like "I agree."

2019
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,418
Just to make it legal.

2020
01:23:26,419 --> 01:23:28,505
Oh, yeah! I agree!

2021
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:30,590
Yeah. Me, too!

2022
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:32,050
1,000%!

2023
01:23:32,133 --> 01:23:33,384
And that's not even
a real number.

2024
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:37,096
Does this mean we're Sevilles?

2025
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:39,599
On this day...

2026
01:23:39,766 --> 01:23:41,518
David Seville has
officially adopted

2027
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:43,978
Alvin, Simon and Theodore
to be his children.

2028
01:23:44,312 --> 01:23:45,897
You three now have
all the legal rights

2029
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:47,106
of any natural child.

2030
01:23:47,273 --> 01:23:48,441
Or, chipmunk.

2031
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:53,112
I hereby sign this order
confirming this adoption.

2032
01:23:53,196 --> 01:23:54,239
Congratulations.

2033
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:55,323
Thank you.

2034
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:56,449
Whoo-hoo!
Yay!

2035
01:23:58,034 --> 01:23:59,786
This is amazing! Yes!

2036
01:23:59,953 --> 01:24:01,496
Guys, guys... Just...

2037
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:03,456
Up high, Judge. Give me some.

2038
01:24:03,623 --> 01:24:04,916
Whoo-hoo! I'm so happy!
Awesome!

2039
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:06,000
Dave!
Whoa!

2040
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:07,168
Sweet!

2041
01:24:07,335 --> 01:24:08,378
Yes! We're a family!

2042
01:24:08,545 --> 01:24:09,671
We have a dad. Legally.

2043
01:24:09,837 --> 01:24:11,005
Okay.

2044
01:24:11,172 --> 01:24:12,298
Okay, all right. Alvin, okay.

2045
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:13,591
What an amazing day!

2046
01:24:14,842 --> 01:24:16,469
They're excited.
Yes!

2047
01:24:22,809 --> 01:24:24,310
Hey, official and legal Dad?

2048
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:26,145
Yes, official and legal son?

2049
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:29,691
Thanks for being the best
official and legal dad, Dad.

2050
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:32,402
Well, you three are the best
official and legal sons

2051
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:34,529
an official and legal father
could ask for.

2052
01:24:34,696 --> 01:24:37,031
Aw. That's sweet
of you to say, Dad.

2053
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:38,199
Yeah.

2054
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:41,494
But seriously, guys, this is
the happiest day of my life.

2055
01:24:41,661 --> 01:24:43,830
Literally nothing
could ruin it for me.

2056
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:50,670
Oh, boy.

2057
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,672
Alvin.

2058
01:24:52,839 --> 01:24:55,174
Totally forgot about this.

2059
01:25:01,014 --> 01:25:03,766
