2
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:49,787
Arbie!

3
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:51,914
Not again!

4
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,333
Don't even think about it!

5
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:57,295
Not cool!

6
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,213
Those are for Jack.

7
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:02,467
I know where you nest and you're
so grounded when we get home.

8
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,599
Careful, Arbie.

9
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:12,977
You know how cranky my dad gets
about his protozoa samples!

10
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:07,990
Surrender the goods
or it's into the volcano with ya!

11
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:10,535
You know, Arbie, it'd be great
if you could be like Selkie

12
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:11,828
and actually help once in a while.

13
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:25,758
Fred! That's no place for
a cold-blooded guy like you.

14
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:51,117
Mr Rusoe, your table is ready.

15
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,870
Oh, well, I hope there's no dress code.

16
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:55,580
I've come straight from the office.

17
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:56,998
- Traffic?
- Brutal.

18
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,542
Please tell me you
have the macadamia nut

19
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,003
- and mealworm sandwich on special today?
- But of course.

20
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,049
So, I think Arbie's been stashing
all the shiny things he keeps swiping

21
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,593
at the Cormorant Cliffs.

22
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,011
I know just where he'd nest.

23
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:12,013
- If you'd just...
- Uh-uh. There's no way.

24
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:13,765
You're not scaling those
cliffs by yourself.

25
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,017
If you fell to your death,
who would make my lunch?

26
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,227
Come with me.
I saw some brilliant lizards there.

27
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:21,063
I don't think Felix would
let me play hooky.

28
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:23,941
Hey, Felix! Take a break.

29
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:25,610
Nim brought lunch.

30
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:28,196
Oh, I'm uh... I'm good.

31
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:30,865
I got some dehydrated beef stroganoff
back at the lab.

32
00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:34,577
But who can think about lunch
in the midst of Jack M. Rusoe's

33
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,205
ground-breaking quest
to find new classes of protozoa?

34
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:39,749
- You've got a, uh...
- Food?

35
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,459
- Nim!
- Did I get it?

36
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,211
- Don't move.
- What? Why?

37
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:44,796
You have a Chimera sea
slug on your face.

38
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:46,464
Chimera? I'm not familiar with it.

39
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,508
- Don't they release a deadly poison?
- You're going to be fine.

40
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:49,634
Whatever you do,

41
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,344
don't freak out!

42
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:54,305
Call poison control!

43
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,933
And if I don't make it, tell Susan H,

44
00:05:57,016 --> 00:05:58,643
the one from my chemistry symposium,
that I've always...

45
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,231
We wouldn't prank you,
if we didn't love you, buddy.

46
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:04,357
Nice.

47
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:06,400
Come, sit.

48
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:09,237
I made a mealworm-free
sandwich just for you.

49
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:21,165
<i>Jack, it's Grant,
your favourite and only father-in-law.</i>

50
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:22,750
<i>Look, I wish I had better news,</i>

51
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:25,169
<i>but those scoundrels at
the Buccaneer Resort Company</i>

52
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,964
<i>will stop at nothing
to get their hands on your island.</i>

53
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:31,926
<i>They've even hired this hotshot lawyer
from Melbourne, who argued that, legally,</i>

54
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:35,555
<i>you're nothing more
than a well-respected squatter.</i>

55
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:38,057
<i>Which means the government's
going to allow the Buccaneers</i>

56
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:41,561
<i>to build one of their ghastly resorts
right on top of you.</i>

57
00:06:41,644 --> 00:06:44,939
<i>Those swindlers are sending surveyors
out at the end of the week.</i>

58
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:48,192
<i>So if you have any tricks left, son,
now is the time.</i>

59
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:51,946
The end of the week?

60
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:53,698
You said they'd never get permission.

61
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,786
It's not over yet.

62
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:01,956
It's time I brought the fight to them.

63
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,708
I want those bureaucrats
to look me in the eye

64
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,377
and tell me they'd rather have
the money from some resort

65
00:07:06,461 --> 00:07:08,212
than finding protozoa,
which could cure disease.

66
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:10,089
They've heard all this before.

67
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:13,301
What if they still don't listen?

68
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:17,138
What if they let them buy the island?

69
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:19,891
What if we have to leave?

70
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,184
I'm not going to lie.

71
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:25,605
It's a long shot, but sometimes
those are the ones worth taking.

72
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:04,102
Watch it, bro!

73
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:22,245
You never
do the dishes any more!

74
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,248
I bought those dishes.
You don't appreciate me.

75
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:28,084
What's going to happen
to all our nice things?

76
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,252
Find a new job!

77
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,419
I can't.

78
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:33,881
No one's hiring Gummies.

79
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,299
The bank wouldn't
give me another loan!

80
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:38,302
What's Edmund supposed to think
of a father who doesn't even try?

81
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:41,222
You want us out on the streets, then?
Your family?

82
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:43,975
- I don't want any of this!
- And I do?

83
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,935
That's what you're saying?

84
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:48,813
- I can't keep having this argument.
- Well, too bad!

85
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:52,191
We had it yesterday, we're having it now,
we're going to have it tomorrow.

86
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:54,610
Not if I take Edmund
and move to my mum's.

87
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:58,739
Here's the rest of my deposit.

88
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:02,535
Can I book you for tomorrow?

89
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:20,553
"Slip 12. We push off by 8:00."

90
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:28,352
Here goes.

91
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:34,859
- So that's it? You're just giving up?
- Why not? You have.

92
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,944
What kind of an example is this setting?

93
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:38,196
What do you want me to do?

94
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,156
Something! Anything!

95
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:42,492
Things can't go on like this.

96
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:44,577
You're useless.

97
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:58,007
<i>- So that's it? You're just giving up?
- Why not? You have.</i>

98
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:01,052
<i>What kind of an example is this setting?</i>

99
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:02,220
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

100
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:04,222
<i>Something! Anything!</i>

101
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:07,183
<i>Things can't go on like this.</i>

102
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:08,851
<i>You're useless.</i>

103
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,050
<i>"Habitat destruction is the biggest
threat to rare and endangered species</i>

104
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:46,180
"by constantly developing or destroying
entire ecosystems in the name of progress."

105
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:50,810
I don't think tacky pirate resorts
can be called progress, Selk.

106
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,605
"Some scientists believe we lose

107
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:58,443
"one endangered species an hour
to extinction,

108
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:03,406
"which could be why biodiversity
is on the decline on every continent."

109
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:10,371
I've been up all night looking
for something bigger than protozoa.

110
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,544
Right. We need something more
Selkie-sized to save our home.

111
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:24,302
This could be it!

112
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,476
Current endangered species list.

113
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:45,907
Bilby Bandicoots, Southern Cassowaries,
Bulmer's Fruit Bats,

114
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:51,078
Fijian Crested Iguanas,
Mahogany Gliders.

115
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:52,914
There's so many.

116
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,795
It used to be impossible
to protect our island,

117
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:01,172
but the law changed two years ago.

118
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,382
So all we have to do is prove there are

119
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:06,093
three or more endangered species
on the island

120
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:08,137
and no one can build anything on it.

121
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:10,014
It becomes a protected habitat.

122
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:11,390
Look, it's a great idea.

123
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,935
I just don't think we can afford
pushing this trip off.

124
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:15,103
You should come with me.

125
00:12:16,145 --> 00:12:17,480
They heard about my
research from you.

126
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:18,815
A 14-year-old?

127
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:20,441
A voice from the generation
that's going to have to

128
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,068
deal with what we've
done to the ocean.

129
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,569
We need a backup plan.

130
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:26,364
- This is our island we're talking about.
- We don't have time.

131
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:29,492
We don't have time to find
one endangered animal, let alone three.

132
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:32,578
I can rhyme off a half dozen
I've already seen around the island

133
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:34,497
and I know all of the
best places to look.

134
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:36,791
You have to let me try.

135
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:41,003
Okay.

136
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,381
You have to promise to be careful.

137
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:45,633
- And you have to watch out for Felix.
- I won't have time.

138
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,802
I'll be too busy looking
for Southern Cassowary,

139
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:50,847
Bilby Bandicoots, Rock Rats.

140
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,809
I swear I've seen Bulmer's Fruit Bats
in the caves near Fire Mountain.

141
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:56,436
This is the last of it, sir.

142
00:12:56,936 --> 00:13:00,773
Can I just say that if anyone can
single-handedly mount a brilliant campaign

143
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,693
to preserve this treasure trove
of biological samples and data points...

144
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:05,903
Your crush on my dad is so embarrassing.

145
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,407
Do me a favour, Felix. Get out of the lab.
Do some field work.

146
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,742
It's just that there are
so many variables in the field.

147
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:12,952
That's the point.

148
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:16,998
Look, you are fantastic at cataloguing
and scheduling.

149
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,125
But science is the study of life
and life is chaotic.

150
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,210
Embrace the chaos. Have a little fun.

151
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:22,753
Get outside. Get your feet wet.

152
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:25,381
Yes, sir. I won't let you down.

153
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:28,342
"Embrace the chaos."

154
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:32,346
And while you're at it, prank Nim back.

155
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,640
The fact you haven't done it yet
is embarrassing.

156
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,819
Hey, Jack!

157
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:26,943
Are you the Edmund
who chartered our boat?

158
00:14:28,111 --> 00:14:29,987
I thought you said you were 18.

159
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:32,115
Yeah, I'm cursed with a baby face.

160
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:34,534
I'm cursed with an ugly brother,
right, Frankie?

161
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:37,703
ID'd everywhere I go.

162
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:40,331
Mum says I'll really
appreciate it when I'm older.

163
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:42,458
I'm sorry, kid.
I can't have someone's mother

164
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:44,168
accusing me of kidnapping
her little prince.

165
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:46,170
You're Dad's little princess, Frankie.

166
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:50,258
- But you already have my deposit.
- Yeah.

167
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:54,387
But it's not enough for me
to risk getting into trouble.

168
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,680
How much would be enough?

169
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:58,766
- You can put that away.
- Dad, I've got this.

170
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,442
I'm Booker.

171
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,570
Where is it you're
trying to take my boat?

172
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,709
That's in the middle of nowhere.

173
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:27,670
There's supposed to be
this amazing gold back triggerfish.

174
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:31,591
It lives on this gorgeous coral,
right around there.

175
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:33,593
I can take you to plenty of spots
to find triggerfish.

176
00:15:33,718 --> 00:15:35,261
No, no, it has to be this spot.

177
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:37,180
Okay, this fish.

178
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:41,225
You know how rare gold backs are?

179
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,144
Alive, they're worth at least $1,000.

180
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:49,192
Frankie, help Ben with the gear.

181
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:50,735
We've got a guppy to ferry.

182
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,739
Frankie, get the rest of the gear.

183
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:22,850
Ben! Ben, you're mucking
up my clean decks!

184
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:25,686
I can't get a signal. Moira's
expecting my kiss good night text.

185
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:30,274
We're only a couple gajillion miles away
from the nearest cell tower, numbskull.

186
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:33,528
What'd you call me? Hey?
What'd you call me?

187
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:37,198
Pull it through two cat
paws and voila!

188
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:40,785
Ain't no one untying that little sucker
without a manual and a couple of hours.

189
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,329
- Hey, Ben, deck looks great.
- Thanks, Dad.

190
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:48,042
- How long till we reach the spot?
- Not long.

191
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:50,086
Doubt we'll find your
gold back trigger, son.

192
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:52,213
They'll be there.

193
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:54,799
Almost everywhere has been
picked clean these days.

194
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:56,384
Of everything.

195
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:57,969
I still think there's plenty out there.

196
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:00,721
Uncharted worlds waiting
to be discovered.

197
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:04,767
Flying lizards, talking
sea lions, mermaids.

198
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:09,313
No, I've got a sixth sense
about these things.

199
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:13,734
There's nothing out there not charted.

200
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:17,447
Adventures have all been had.

201
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:15,296
Landed on the island
just before sunrise.

202
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:23,221
Getting the lay of the land.

203
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:25,640
Meeting all sorts of interesting locals.

204
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:29,352
Still, no sign of the
gold backtriggerfish.

205
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:33,815
Hi, little guy.

206
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,907
Oh, wow, look at that.

207
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,454
Is that a lab?

208
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:52,750
There she is!

209
00:18:58,464 --> 00:19:00,299
If you want something, ask me to get it.

210
00:19:00,383 --> 00:19:02,593
You know I worked very hard
to find places for everything.

211
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:05,930
"Empty 500-milliliter plastic jar.

212
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:07,849
"Purpose TBD."

213
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:09,559
You have some serious issues.

214
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:11,352
Serious labelling issues.

215
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:14,981
You might thrive on chaos, but that's
not how the rest of the world works.

216
00:19:15,064 --> 00:19:17,859
Society thrives on order, control.

217
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,902
Maybe moving to the mainland
might be the best thing for you.

218
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:23,239
Go to a proper school,
work on your people skills,

219
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:24,824
improve your manners.

220
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:25,950
Learn to respect your elders.

221
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:27,535
I don't need people skills.

222
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:30,496
It's just me and Jack
and that's the way we like it.

223
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,457
And you're not my elder.

224
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,833
You're not that much older than me.

225
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,461
I've been in school longer
than you've been alive.

226
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:40,756
So? I've learned why the barometric
pressure drops before a storm,

227
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,884
what starfish eat for breakfast,

228
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:45,094
all without setting foot
in some stuffy classroom.

229
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:46,929
Don't you want to be around
kids your own age?

230
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:48,181
You know, have friends?

231
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:51,017
How can you imply I don't have friends
in front of Selkie?

232
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:54,353
And you say I'm the one
who needs to improve my manners.

233
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:57,690
If you'll excuse me, I've got
three endangered species to find

234
00:19:57,774 --> 00:19:59,275
before the Buccaneers show up.

235
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:00,401
Come on, Fred.

236
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:02,653
Let's get some pictures of
our favourite Central Rock Rats.

237
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:08,367
I know you want me to go out into
the field, but I'll go out later.

238
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:09,744
The field can wait.

239
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,627
I told you
I'd go do it, and I will.

240
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:19,504
Just as soon as I finish with this.

241
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,548
The lab is not a petting zoo.

242
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:25,009
I refuse to be guilt-tripped
by a sea lion.

243
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,020
Fascinating!

244
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:39,107
The nitrogen seems to
have frozen my pants.

245
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:43,861
Solid!

246
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:54,872
Please keep this between us, Selkie.

247
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:07,051
Fred, I really thought we had
Central Rock Rats on the island.

248
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,846
This just looks like
your average black rat, doesn't it?

249
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:16,936
You hear that?

250
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,480
Sounded big.

251
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:23,067
Maybe it's our Southern Cassowary.

252
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:26,404
If we startle it, don't be afraid, Fred.

253
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:33,703
They sometimes make these terrible
rattling, booming calls.

254
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:55,266
Who are you,
and what do you think you're doing here?

255
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,645
The name's Edmund.

256
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:01,689
- Where are the others?
- Others?

257
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:05,568
The last time our island was invaded there
was a whole ship full of pasty tourists.

258
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:07,779
- But I took care of them.
- I know.

259
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:10,072
I was there, remember?

260
00:22:11,532 --> 00:22:13,993
I talked to you and everything,
which is a miracle

261
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:16,704
because back then I was absolutely
terrible at talking to girls.

262
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:23,586
You've gotten, uh,

263
00:22:25,505 --> 00:22:26,589
taller.

264
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:29,717
- That was you?
- Yeah.

265
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:35,056
My mother says I've really
grown into my ears.

266
00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:39,143
Are you taking pictures?
Are you a spy for the Buccaneers?

267
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:40,770
No way. That's just my video camera.

268
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:43,189
See, I like to film.

269
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:44,649
I guess you could say it's my hobby.

270
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:46,150
I've heard of these.

271
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:48,736
You've never seen a video camera before?

272
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:55,034
Is that you?

273
00:22:55,535 --> 00:22:58,079
The high-pitched screaming?
That's all you.

274
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:02,792
That camera's a few years old,

275
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,418
but that model's perfect
for being out in the wild.

276
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:06,712
Cool. How do I delete everything?

277
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,382
- What?
- I can't have you bringing proof

278
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:12,301
of how amazing our island is
to the rest of the world.

279
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:14,512
We're already about to be
overrun by invaders.

280
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,682
But I've been trying to
get back here for ages.

281
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:20,893
Start deleting, or I start testing
how shark-proof that thing is.

282
00:23:25,648 --> 00:23:27,900
Hey, no one's looking for me.

283
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:29,652
Okay, no one even knows where I am.

284
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:32,738
I won't take more footage.

285
00:23:32,822 --> 00:23:34,115
Save your breath.

286
00:23:34,198 --> 00:23:36,534
It's a long row
back to civilisation.

287
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:39,787
I've saved for three years

288
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:40,913
walking dogs,

289
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:44,542
looking after the twins
in the apartment below

290
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,378
and they were just pure evil.

291
00:23:47,462 --> 00:23:50,465
But dinghies, tents, camping stoves,
they're not cheap.

292
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:52,091
This isn't a camp ground.

293
00:23:52,175 --> 00:23:53,634
This is our home.

294
00:23:53,718 --> 00:23:57,221
And I've got more important things to do
than to argue with an invader.

295
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:58,765
Get in.

296
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:02,268
What could you possibly
be worried about?

297
00:24:02,351 --> 00:24:06,147
This place is amazing. It's perfect.

298
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:07,774
And I'd like to keep it that way.

299
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,902
Are any ships gonna come by soon
that could give me a ride?

300
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:12,278
Ships hardly ever come by.

301
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:15,990
One of the advantages of living
on a remote, deserted island.

302
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:18,659
How do you expect me to paddle
all the way back to the mainland?

303
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:40,765
Oh, no. No, my boat!

304
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:42,183
Look!

305
00:24:46,604 --> 00:24:49,357
It's ripped. Now I'll have to stay.

306
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:02,787
Look, once I explain to
the Minister of the Environment,

307
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,832
face to face, how
important the island is

308
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:08,876
there's no way she'll let
those Buccaneers buy it.

309
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,628
Yeah, I'm walking in now.

310
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:11,879
<i>Are you wearing shoes?</i>

311
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:14,090
Of course I have shoes on.

312
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:17,927
Flip-flops do not qualify as shoes.

313
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:21,180
I'll have your meeting with the Minister
rescheduled for tomorrow.

314
00:25:21,305 --> 00:25:23,558
- What?
- We'll need to buy you a suit.

315
00:25:23,641 --> 00:25:26,269
No, that's ridiculous.
I'm sure I have something that works.

316
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:30,273
Nim's calling.

317
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:33,651
- Nim, is everything...
- There's a boy on the island,

318
00:25:33,776 --> 00:25:35,862
<i>but I tried to get him to leave
and his boat sank.</i>

319
00:25:36,028 --> 00:25:38,030
<i>- If you ask me...
- Nim, slow down.</i>

320
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:40,158
<i>- What if we're stuck with him forever?
- Slow down. A boy?</i>

321
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:41,617
<i>He says his name's Edmund,</i>

322
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:44,162
but I don't trust a word he says.

323
00:25:44,328 --> 00:25:46,497
<i>Good instincts. Put him on the phone.</i>

324
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:48,916
Here.

325
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:54,630
- Hello?
- Careful with that!

326
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:56,507
- Careful.
- Is this a bad time?

327
00:25:56,716 --> 00:25:59,093
Yes. How old are you?

328
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,220
What are you doing on the island?
How'd you get there?

329
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,347
<i>Are you alone?</i>

330
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:06,768
I'm 14 and I took a
charter fishing boat.

331
00:26:06,893 --> 00:26:10,062
<i>But I ditched them last night,
in my dinghy.</i>

332
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,523
Which sank.

333
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:14,275
Unexpectedly.

334
00:26:14,734 --> 00:26:16,694
That's my lunch.
Don't smush my lunch.

335
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,113
Oh, dear.

336
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:21,073
I won't touch your lunch, I swear.

337
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,326
I just came here for a
bit of an adventure.

338
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:24,452
With my daughter?

339
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:26,162
Well, sure.

340
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:28,748
But I don't think she likes me very...

341
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:30,750
<i>There will be no adventures
with my daughter.</i>

342
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:32,043
<i>Nim is not like other girls.</i>

343
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:34,295
<i>She can outrun, out-climb
and definitely outwit you.</i>

344
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:36,130
<i>- So no funny stuff.
- Yes.</i>

345
00:26:36,631 --> 00:26:38,591
<i>"Yes"? That's all you
have to say is "yes"?</i>

346
00:26:38,674 --> 00:26:40,259
I mean, yes, sir.

347
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:43,387
I'm going to assume that your parents
don't know where you are.

348
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:46,390
Yeah. I mean, no.

349
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:49,393
Whichever one means

350
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:52,063
they know I'm here
and they're totally cool with it.

351
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:55,691
<i>What's your home number, Edmund. Now!</i>

352
00:26:57,235 --> 00:27:02,782
049-157-0158.

353
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:06,661
They're never going to let me set foot
outside the apartment again, are they?

354
00:27:06,828 --> 00:27:07,912
I wouldn't.

355
00:27:08,037 --> 00:27:09,330
Put Nim back on the phone.

356
00:27:17,547 --> 00:27:19,340
So what should I do?

357
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,468
Anchor him out in the bay
on one of the emergency rafts?

358
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:23,678
<i>That's funny.</i>

359
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:25,388
Just keep an eye on him.

360
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:28,891
Whatever you do, Nim,
do not trust teenage boys.

361
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:30,268
I should know, I used to be one.

362
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:31,853
Mmm.

363
00:27:31,936 --> 00:27:33,104
Gross.

364
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:34,856
Good luck, Jack.

365
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:44,031
- This is awful.
- Yeah, agreed.

366
00:27:44,115 --> 00:27:45,825
Come on, to the shops with you.

367
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:49,203
And you just have to get used to
boys taking your daughter on adventures.

368
00:27:49,287 --> 00:27:50,329
I had to.

369
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:06,554
So,

370
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:10,933
wanna see what's on TV?

371
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:16,105
- That was meant to be a joke.
- I don't have time for jokes.

372
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,024
Sorry!

373
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,276
Didn't realise this was
such a busy time for you.

374
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,028
You don't know anything about me.

375
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:23,905
This whole island is depending on me

376
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:26,365
to keep it pristine and untouched
and you're touching it.

377
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:28,910
Well, you don't know
anything about me either, okay?

378
00:28:28,993 --> 00:28:32,413
And unless I learn to fly, I can't
help touching your stupid island.

379
00:28:32,497 --> 00:28:35,291
- If it's so stupid, Why'd you come?
- I don't know!

380
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,606
Hey, you reckon that dumb kid's nearby?

381
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:00,274
Maybe he's found his goldfish.

382
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:02,401
This is where he was headed
the whole time, idiot.

383
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:04,112
We'll catch up to him tomorrow.

384
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:06,531
Island like this isn't
safe for a guppy like him.

385
00:29:07,782 --> 00:29:10,743
Do you think there's a super-rare
creature that lives out here, Dad?

386
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:13,246
Like a woman ugly enough
to go out with you?

387
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:15,039
- Ugly like Moira?
- Moira's gorgeous!

388
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:17,834
- If you like big feet.
- They're not that large!

389
00:29:19,168 --> 00:29:20,795
Frankie, stop messing about.

390
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:22,672
Go and unload the rest of the gear.

391
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:37,061
Frankie do this, Frankie do that.

392
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:39,480
Why can't you be more like
your idiot brother, hmm?

393
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:43,151
Maybe because I've got more
than two brain cells to rub together.

394
00:29:43,234 --> 00:29:46,028
What do you think, Dad?
Sixth sense telling you anything?

395
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:49,157
Ooh...

396
00:29:49,907 --> 00:29:51,701
I'm having a vision right now.

397
00:29:53,161 --> 00:29:56,414
This time tomorrow
all of them cages'll be filled

398
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:59,709
with rare and valuable

399
00:29:59,876 --> 00:30:01,711
animals.

400
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,504
Yeah.

401
00:30:03,588 --> 00:30:05,006
Whoo!

402
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:19,395
Classic Felix.

403
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:22,315
He sleeps while the island's
being besieged by an invader.

404
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:25,526
One inflatable dinghy's hardly a siege.

405
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,153
I'm more like a spy.

406
00:30:28,613 --> 00:30:31,616
I'm not an invader, exactly.

407
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:33,951
Really I'm an innovator.

408
00:30:34,327 --> 00:30:35,703
Wh...

409
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:39,957
This is your room?

410
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:42,627
It's, uh...

411
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:44,170
It's cool.

412
00:30:45,922 --> 00:30:47,006
Alex Rover!

413
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:50,676
Is okay, you know.

414
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:56,557
If you like the whole brilliant sense of
humour meets death-defying action thing.

415
00:30:56,641 --> 00:30:58,851
You'll be out here

416
00:30:58,976 --> 00:31:01,187
until Jack gets back.

417
00:31:04,315 --> 00:31:06,025
This is great!

418
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:09,821
I guess I'll be all right
sleeping in the tree house.

419
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:12,573
With its own zip line!

420
00:31:13,783 --> 00:31:15,493
That should foil your escape plan.

421
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:19,413
Hey, what about going to the...

422
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,083
Going to the

423
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,626
bathroom?

424
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,006
Never mind.

425
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:55,783
Hey, mate.

426
00:31:57,535 --> 00:31:58,828
Hey, you want a Gummy?

427
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:00,455
Here.

428
00:32:01,205 --> 00:32:02,373
- Green's the best.
- Stop.

429
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:04,542
Fred's on a diet.

430
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:07,295
Fruit and wingless insects only.

431
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:09,213
If you want to feed him, try this.

432
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:13,259
Sorry, buddy.

433
00:32:13,342 --> 00:32:18,222
You sure you don't want a delicious
piece of mango instead? Hmm? Mmm!

434
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:19,640
Knew it!

435
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:22,935
Those lizards at the Cormorant Cliffs
have to be Fijian Crested Iguanas.

436
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,564
They love heights,
and they're gorgeous.

437
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:28,483
That's so weird.

438
00:32:28,858 --> 00:32:29,984
What?

439
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,570
Sorry. Where can I, uh...

440
00:32:34,906 --> 00:32:35,948
Whoa.

441
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:37,950
Where can I spit?

442
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:51,255
Thanks.

443
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,883
I didn't want Gummy
between my teeth all night.

444
00:32:58,262 --> 00:32:59,514
Excuse me, Fred.

445
00:32:59,597 --> 00:33:02,391
Hey, that's so weird
you have all the Alex Rover books.

446
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:05,728
I know people who've read one or two,
but you have the whole collection.

447
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:07,897
I mean, I've got to have
a lot of respect...

448
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,942
I've got to have a lot
of respect for a man

449
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:14,821
who doesn't even break a sweat when he's
dangling from an icy cliff by the...

450
00:33:15,404 --> 00:33:18,366
...quickly unravelling thread
of one of his gloves?

451
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:21,160
I thought you weren't into
the whole "Alex Rover" thing.

452
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:24,455
Come on, who wouldn't be into Alex Rover?
He's a great character.

453
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,833
So's the author, Alexandra Rover.

454
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:29,377
Wait, what?

455
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:33,172
She uses a pen name, which you
would know if you were a real fan.

456
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:35,800
She's actually in Bora-Bora right now,
researching her next book.

457
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:38,261
Whoa...

458
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,722
I've always imagined some
grizzled, bearded man

459
00:33:41,806 --> 00:33:43,724
banging on a typewriter in a hut somewhere.

460
00:33:43,808 --> 00:33:45,560
But that's brilliant.

461
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:47,311
Explains the sensitive side.

462
00:33:48,146 --> 00:33:51,774
Have you read the latest one,
Alex Rover Never Surrenders?

463
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:53,443
I'm almost at the end.

464
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:55,736
It's torturing me that I don't have
time to finish it right now.

465
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,865
I think it's genius when
Alex gets the queen bee,

466
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:02,452
and drops it in the enemy camp
and the swarm comes.

467
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:04,745
And you haven't got to
that chapter yet, have you?

468
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:05,872
Nope.

469
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:09,083
Uh...

470
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:10,334
Spoiler alert.

471
00:34:45,244 --> 00:34:48,498
While the natives are still
suspicious of my presence here

472
00:34:48,581 --> 00:34:50,500
the island remains absolutely gorgeous.

473
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:51,959
It's as if the creatures here,

474
00:34:52,043 --> 00:34:54,462
they're trying to tell me,

475
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:57,256
"Hey, buddy, she'll warm up to you."

476
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,801
"Your parents can't legally
ground you for life."

477
00:34:59,884 --> 00:35:01,260
Or can they?

478
00:35:09,602 --> 00:35:11,270
There.

479
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:13,648
That should do it.

480
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:15,233
I have everything I need.

481
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:18,903
I'm ready for the field.

482
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:21,489
Ready to conquer the field.

483
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:24,575
I have the situation
completely under control.

484
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,537
Here goes.

485
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:33,376
As soon as I have double checked
that I am truly prepared.

486
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:42,009
Some dehydrated stroganoff

487
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:45,263
in case I get a bit peckish.

488
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:49,434
In which case I'll need
some purified water

489
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:51,269
and the camping stove.

490
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:55,606
That means the burns kit.

491
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,025
In fact, I should bring
the entire first aid kit.

492
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:05,324
And some insect repellent.

493
00:36:05,408 --> 00:36:09,036
Scratching bites is not conducive
to work in the field.

494
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,708
Where the potential to get lost
increases exponentially.

495
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:18,004
I need to bring some extra maps
and a compass.

496
00:36:22,717 --> 00:36:24,135
Unacceptable.

497
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:33,770
Ooh, disaster averted.

498
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:02,673
Some guard you are, Selk!

499
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:04,217
Who knows where he's run off to.

500
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:06,260
Had to use the little boys' room.

501
00:37:07,512 --> 00:37:09,806
So about these animals that you
need to find all over the island...

502
00:37:09,889 --> 00:37:11,307
How do you know about that?

503
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,850
I peeked at your list.

504
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:15,353
And the map.

505
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,563
But I put two and two together

506
00:37:17,647 --> 00:37:19,732
and I think I can help.

507
00:37:19,982 --> 00:37:21,359
Help how?

508
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:24,946
I don't know exactly,
but I'm sure I can do something.

509
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:27,865
What do you want to do
with the animals once you find them?

510
00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:29,617
Take their photo?

511
00:37:29,784 --> 00:37:31,786
Is that what you're using
this old Polaroid for?

512
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:33,704
I love my camera. It's not old.

513
00:37:34,664 --> 00:37:36,624
It's a cool camera, yeah.

514
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:38,459
Old school, but...

515
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,172
Look, I can capture these animals
in action, okay?

516
00:37:43,256 --> 00:37:46,467
We can make our own nature video
right on your computer.

517
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:47,802
There's no "we" here.

518
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:50,471
And tracking animals
is serious business.

519
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:51,931
If yesterday proves anything,

520
00:37:52,014 --> 00:37:54,517
it's that you have no idea
how to move through the jungle.

521
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,727
You'd be like, "I'm here, I'm here!

522
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:58,729
"Hurry up and hide
from my fancy camera!"

523
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:00,022
See?

524
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:01,566
You think my camera's fancy.

525
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,776
- You want me to come with you.
- Absolutely not.

526
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,903
Are you sure you want to
leave me alone with her?

527
00:38:06,737 --> 00:38:09,282
She looks like someone
who's fond of taking naps.

528
00:38:10,074 --> 00:38:12,535
And WWARD.

529
00:38:15,288 --> 00:38:16,330
Wward?

530
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:18,416
What Would Alex Rover Do?

531
00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:21,669
Keep his enemies close.

532
00:38:23,713 --> 00:38:25,465
Fine, invader. Come on.

533
00:38:32,805 --> 00:38:34,682
If Susan H could see me now.

534
00:38:34,974 --> 00:38:36,350
I wonder where she is.

535
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:38,853
At school, probably enjoying
the state-of-the-art equipment,

536
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:40,438
the air conditioning.

537
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:41,981
What was I thinking
taking this internship?

538
00:38:42,064 --> 00:38:44,150
I don't want to let Jack down,
but what if I can't...

539
00:39:04,504 --> 00:39:05,546
Oh...

540
00:39:07,632 --> 00:39:09,842
I really liked having depth perception.

541
00:39:24,482 --> 00:39:25,525
Oh.

542
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:31,906
Oh!

543
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,578
We've been here for ages.

544
00:39:37,662 --> 00:39:39,413
Is this Bilby creature
ever going to show up?

545
00:39:39,497 --> 00:39:40,957
Not if you keep talking.

546
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:51,467
Maybe some of the other endangered animals
on your list are less camera shy?

547
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:56,931
You and Fred are obsessed with...

548
00:39:57,014 --> 00:39:58,307
Worms!

549
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:02,895
Yuck! Yuck!

550
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:05,857
Oh! That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever done.

551
00:40:07,316 --> 00:40:09,068
You said you wanted to help.

552
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:37,638
Are you filming this?

553
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:43,186
Oh, gross! Gross, gross!

554
00:40:43,686 --> 00:40:44,896
Oh!

555
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:48,941
- After all that, you had to scare her off.
- Not on purpose.

556
00:40:50,234 --> 00:40:51,611
It was the worm's fault.

557
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:56,115
It left a slime trail on my arm.

558
00:40:57,492 --> 00:40:58,826
I didn't mean to scare it.

559
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,662
We don't have worms
that slimy in Brisbane.

560
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:04,957
Nim?

561
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,925
"Embrace the chaos."

562
00:41:15,593 --> 00:41:16,636
Ooh!

563
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:20,598
Life is chaos.

564
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:23,101
"Embrace the..."

565
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,689
<i>That's a Dendrocnide excelsa.</i>

566
00:41:28,773 --> 00:41:30,733
The Stinging Tree.

567
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:38,157
It's not deadly, just painful.

568
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:39,951
You're going to live. Live!

569
00:41:40,076 --> 00:41:42,161
Survive! You will survive!

570
00:41:45,164 --> 00:41:47,291
"Embrace the chaos"!

571
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:56,717
- Can we slow down?
- No!

572
00:41:56,801 --> 00:41:59,720
We wasted the whole morning
scaring off a Bilby

573
00:41:59,804 --> 00:42:04,225
and I need evidence of three
endangered species yesterday.

574
00:42:04,308 --> 00:42:07,270
So, no, I will not slow down.

575
00:42:07,353 --> 00:42:11,691
Hopefully the family of Mahogany Gliders
still lives near Keyhole Cove.

576
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:13,401
Great.

577
00:42:14,235 --> 00:42:15,570
I'm right behind you. I just...

578
00:42:16,404 --> 00:42:17,738
I just need a second.

579
00:42:19,282 --> 00:42:20,825
She's really fit.

580
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:26,289
Nim!

581
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:27,999
Nim!

582
00:42:39,886 --> 00:42:41,637
Edmund!

583
00:43:13,252 --> 00:43:14,754
Fred okay?

584
00:43:27,725 --> 00:43:30,853
- Why is the cave glowing like that?
- They're glow worms.

585
00:43:30,937 --> 00:43:32,647
These are worms
I can get behind.

586
00:43:38,194 --> 00:43:40,905
Nim, bats. Bats.

587
00:43:47,912 --> 00:43:50,289
Our first endangered species.

588
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:52,291
Edmund, you're brilliant!

589
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:54,043
I'll try to trip more often.

590
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:03,845
See, I knew I
saw bats on your list.

591
00:44:03,928 --> 00:44:05,430
I'm good for more than just my camera.

592
00:44:05,513 --> 00:44:07,390
My memory is practically photographic.

593
00:44:07,515 --> 00:44:10,518
I had no idea that colony
of Bulmer's Fruit Bats had moved.

594
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:13,354
I had no idea Bulmer's
Fruit Bats existed.

595
00:44:13,438 --> 00:44:15,857
You need to get out more.
Invade more islands.

596
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,483
So now you're glad I invaded?

597
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:20,236
- I didn't say that, but...
- I get it.

598
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,447
You're just using me for my camera.

599
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:26,284
- Why can't you like me for me, Nim?
- You're such a weirdo.

600
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:28,744
- I'm a useful weirdo.
- Absolutely.

601
00:44:28,828 --> 00:44:32,290
Without you, I would have searched
the caves by Fire Mountain for hours.

602
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:36,753
So you're not still mad at me
for scaring the Bilby off?

603
00:44:36,836 --> 00:44:38,379
Of course I'm still mad.

604
00:44:38,463 --> 00:44:39,756
He was right there.

605
00:44:40,423 --> 00:44:41,674
Here we are.

606
00:44:43,176 --> 00:44:45,052
- Where are the gliders?
- Up this tree.

607
00:44:46,637 --> 00:44:47,680
Oh.

608
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:50,057
Are you...

609
00:44:50,141 --> 00:44:51,559
Horribly afraid of heights?

610
00:44:52,477 --> 00:44:53,978
It's natural when you think about it.

611
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:57,523
See, heights mean long falls,
meaning brutal landings.

612
00:44:57,607 --> 00:44:58,733
Hand me the camera.

613
00:45:21,547 --> 00:45:24,300
Come on out, guys. Where are you?

614
00:45:26,552 --> 00:45:28,179
No sign of them.

615
00:45:28,262 --> 00:45:30,848
Maybe Jack was right.
This could take ages.

616
00:45:30,932 --> 00:45:32,433
Hey, Dad!

617
00:45:32,517 --> 00:45:33,976
A very nice lorikeet.

618
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,311
Look at the pretty colours.

619
00:45:36,354 --> 00:45:38,773
- Not another one of them things.
- Oh, no.

620
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:41,359
They're all over the mainland.
Practically pests.

621
00:45:41,442 --> 00:45:42,568
Just turn it loose.

622
00:45:43,277 --> 00:45:45,196
Yeah, yeah, we didn't
come here for stupid lorikeets.

623
00:45:45,279 --> 00:45:46,322
Arbie.

624
00:45:46,572 --> 00:45:50,076
- We came here for... For...
- Don't hurt yourself, Ben.

625
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:53,454
Ben is right. We're onto something
big here, I can feel it.

626
00:45:53,538 --> 00:45:56,416
Yeah, but we've already got
cages full of bearded dragons,

627
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:59,836
gliders, birds, blue-tongued skinks

628
00:45:59,919 --> 00:46:02,463
and enough eggs
to make an enormous omelette.

629
00:46:03,506 --> 00:46:06,092
Check the traps every hour.

630
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:07,802
We're missing something.

631
00:46:07,885 --> 00:46:09,595
You know, we should
find that Edmund kid

632
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:12,098
and thank him for bringing us here.

633
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,059
With our haul, I'm going to be
able to spoil Moira rotten.

634
00:46:18,104 --> 00:46:20,982
Nim, wait!
I'm not with them.

635
00:46:21,065 --> 00:46:23,568
- I didn't mean to...
- Bring poachers to my island?

636
00:46:23,651 --> 00:46:25,570
No, I thought they were fishermen.

637
00:46:25,653 --> 00:46:29,490
I even made up this great lie
where you were a gold back triggerfish.

638
00:46:29,574 --> 00:46:30,825
You told them about me?

639
00:46:30,908 --> 00:46:32,243
No, it was a metaphor.

640
00:46:33,244 --> 00:46:34,537
I was
starting to trust you,

641
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,706
but this whole time
you were working with them.

642
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:40,168
- I haven't. I just...
- Liar!

643
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:43,504
That's why you were so interested
in helping me find a Bilby and the Gliders!

644
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:44,630
I just wanted to help.

645
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:48,259
I want you off my island now.
And take your friends with you.

646
00:46:48,384 --> 00:46:49,927
Nim.

647
00:46:50,261 --> 00:46:51,763
I said, go.

648
00:47:17,955 --> 00:47:19,040
Minister O'Hare,

649
00:47:19,123 --> 00:47:21,334
I know you have pressing
environmental issues here in Brisbane,

650
00:47:21,417 --> 00:47:22,752
but I need your help.

651
00:47:23,336 --> 00:47:26,422
It's easy to think of our island
as remote, disconnected,

652
00:47:26,506 --> 00:47:28,174
inconsequential even.

653
00:47:31,344 --> 00:47:32,386
Um...

654
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:36,057
But, uh...

655
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,142
Um...

656
00:47:41,395 --> 00:47:44,524
It's funny, my daughter,
she likes to make fun of me.

657
00:47:44,607 --> 00:47:48,694
She thinks I'm only
interested in protozoa,

658
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:50,863
it's this single-cell organism.

659
00:47:52,115 --> 00:47:57,078
But protozoa's the key to understanding
more complex species, entire ecosystems.

660
00:47:57,495 --> 00:48:00,498
It's easy to spot change
more quickly in a single cell.

661
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:05,503
It gives you time to react,

662
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:09,048
time to make changes
before it's too late.

663
00:48:09,132 --> 00:48:10,758
And our island,

664
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:13,970
it's like a single cell.

665
00:48:14,053 --> 00:48:15,096
It's a litmus test.

666
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:18,766
Whatever hits our island,
is coming to the mainland next.

667
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,185
And if you put a, uh...

668
00:48:23,604 --> 00:48:27,608
If you put a pirate resort
in the middle of the island,

669
00:48:27,692 --> 00:48:29,026
who's going to notice?

670
00:48:35,158 --> 00:48:38,244
Dr Rusoe,
I admire your passion.

671
00:48:39,203 --> 00:48:40,747
But it's going to take
a lot more than a speech

672
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,707
to keep the Buccaneers
off your island.

673
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:46,794
But let's see what we can do.

674
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,254
How long can you stay?

675
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:55,636
Pick up. Pick up.

676
00:48:56,804 --> 00:48:58,431
<i>Please leave a message at the tone.</i>

677
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:02,977
Jack, you have to come home.

678
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:07,690
I can't find Felix.

679
00:49:07,774 --> 00:49:09,901
And there are poachers, and Edmund...

680
00:49:14,071 --> 00:49:15,239
You were right.

681
00:49:17,116 --> 00:49:18,409
I couldn't trust him.

682
00:49:21,662 --> 00:49:23,998
Just come home, please.

683
00:49:26,751 --> 00:49:30,004
Daddy, I need you.

684
00:49:59,325 --> 00:50:01,202
Without the invader's camera,

685
00:50:01,285 --> 00:50:03,454
I'll have to start over
on the endangered species search.

686
00:50:04,288 --> 00:50:06,791
We need three, or we
could lose the island.

687
00:50:20,638 --> 00:50:22,682
Every animal is worth saving,

688
00:50:22,765 --> 00:50:25,393
but those poachers said
they had cages full of animals.

689
00:50:27,895 --> 00:50:29,730
We have to free them first.

690
00:50:47,165 --> 00:50:48,958
The Buccaneers have sent
surveyors out early.

691
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:51,461
I'd better find Nim before
she unleashes her army

692
00:50:51,544 --> 00:50:53,713
of deranged animal allies on them.

693
00:50:59,343 --> 00:51:00,386
Huh?

694
00:51:03,806 --> 00:51:04,891
Oh!

695
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:08,352
Speaking of, if that colourful bird is you,
Arbie, I will not forget this.

696
00:51:16,194 --> 00:51:17,278
Yeah!

697
00:51:17,403 --> 00:51:19,030
All right!

698
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,364
All right!

699
00:51:20,448 --> 00:51:21,949
You men there!
Thank goodness you're here.

700
00:51:22,366 --> 00:51:23,910
I don't know if this net belongs to you

701
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:25,787
or it belongs to
the Buccaneer Resort Company

702
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:29,916
but either way
I need to be extricated immediately.

703
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:31,042
I wonder how much he'd go for

704
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,335
on the black market.

705
00:51:32,627 --> 00:51:34,295
Why would they want a chubby nerd?

706
00:51:34,378 --> 00:51:36,297
Nerd? I am an academic.

707
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,548
It was a joke, Ben.

708
00:51:38,132 --> 00:51:39,217
Your face is a joke!

709
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,344
Let me down, or I'll call your manager.

710
00:51:41,427 --> 00:51:43,763
- It means...
- Don't hurt yourself, Ben.

711
00:51:43,846 --> 00:51:47,183
- Your face!
- You think you're funny, but you're not.

712
00:51:47,266 --> 00:51:50,436
Dear Buccaneer complaint department,

713
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,940
"I am writing you
to inform you of an altercation

714
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:57,276
"with two of your employees
who left me stranded."

715
00:52:01,572 --> 00:52:04,450
I know it's tough being
stuck in a small space,

716
00:52:04,534 --> 00:52:06,035
but it's only for a few more minutes.

717
00:52:06,828 --> 00:52:08,329
If Alex did her research,

718
00:52:08,413 --> 00:52:11,416
your drones are already
mounting a search and rescue party.

719
00:52:11,499 --> 00:52:12,792
They'll have their queen back soon.

720
00:52:14,544 --> 00:52:15,711
Wait for me here

721
00:52:15,795 --> 00:52:18,464
and if anything happens,
we rendezvous back at base camp.

722
00:52:18,923 --> 00:52:20,216
Arbie, no!

723
00:52:30,852 --> 00:52:33,312
Some of those animals are ugly.

724
00:52:33,396 --> 00:52:35,523
Might have found you
a girlfriend, finally, Frankie.

725
00:52:35,606 --> 00:52:38,526
You would know. You have
experience dating an ugly animal.

726
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:39,652
Moira's not ugly.

727
00:52:39,735 --> 00:52:41,195
Yeah, yeah, of course. Of course.

728
00:52:41,279 --> 00:52:43,406
Compared to a warthog,
she's downright lovely.

729
00:52:44,365 --> 00:52:46,451
She pitched a fit
when you bought her daisies.

730
00:52:46,534 --> 00:52:48,327
That's my fault!
I know she likes roses better.

731
00:52:48,786 --> 00:52:50,455
The girl of my dreams deserves roses.

732
00:52:51,414 --> 00:52:53,708
I'm not trying to.
Get out of my face!

733
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:55,042
Think you're funny,
but you're not funny.

734
00:52:55,126 --> 00:52:57,295
- Watch me. I'm funnier than you.
- You can't even tell a joke!

735
00:52:59,672 --> 00:53:00,923
Way to go, Arbie.

736
00:53:04,635 --> 00:53:05,887
Get out of here!

737
00:53:29,535 --> 00:53:30,995
Into the water! The water!

738
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:38,252
Please! Please, go away!

739
00:53:38,336 --> 00:53:39,504
Please, I don't like stings!

740
00:53:39,587 --> 00:53:42,381
Bees can't swim! Into the water!

741
00:53:42,465 --> 00:53:43,758
Ben! Ben!

742
00:53:43,841 --> 00:53:44,884
What'd I ever do to you?

743
00:53:45,718 --> 00:53:48,554
Pack your bags and tie your shoes, guys.

744
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:49,764
Oh, get off!

745
00:53:49,847 --> 00:53:51,307
This is a jailbreak.

746
00:53:55,853 --> 00:53:57,522
Not the face! Not the face!

747
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,904
That's your favourite son?

748
00:54:05,613 --> 00:54:09,450
That was so brave of Ben
leading all them bees away from us.

749
00:54:09,534 --> 00:54:10,743
What?

750
00:54:13,371 --> 00:54:17,250
Wow. Okay. Plan B.

751
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,016
Come on. Come on!

752
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:36,018
Stupid dull knife.

753
00:54:36,102 --> 00:54:37,979
Poachers need to take
better care of their things.

754
00:54:52,285 --> 00:54:54,203
Well, hello, my pretty girl.

755
00:54:56,664 --> 00:54:57,707
How do you know it's a girl?

756
00:54:57,832 --> 00:55:00,168
Maybe it's her long eyelashes
and that pink bow in her hair.

757
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:02,044
Do you know how much
the Russian Circus would pay

758
00:55:02,128 --> 00:55:04,172
for a trained seal with
both its flippers?

759
00:55:04,255 --> 00:55:06,090
- Dad, I think that's a sea lion.
- Shut up, Frankie.

760
00:55:06,174 --> 00:55:08,426
- Come on, Ben. Have a guess. How much?
- 50 bucks.

761
00:55:08,551 --> 00:55:11,429
Exactly! $50,000.

762
00:55:31,282 --> 00:55:32,950
You can't stay out there forever!

763
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:36,037
Yeah, good one, Ben.
That's the perfect size for a sea lion.

764
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,747
Right size for you, runt!

765
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:46,464
I know, I'm trying.

766
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,010
I'll be back, guys, I promise.

767
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,386
With my machete.

768
00:55:57,058 --> 00:55:59,352
Selkie, we'll have to come back.
The cages were...

769
00:56:01,687 --> 00:56:02,772
Selk?

770
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:26,462
Selkie's fine. She has to be fine.

771
00:56:46,274 --> 00:56:47,650
What?

772
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:50,486
I know I'm late,
but that's no reason to yell at me.

773
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:51,696
She was trying to warn you.

774
00:56:52,697 --> 00:56:55,867
Just so you know, when my dad gets home
he's going to kick your...

775
00:56:55,992 --> 00:56:58,161
That's him! Jack!

776
00:56:58,244 --> 00:57:02,123
Sorry to disappoint you, but that's
just my boys looting the place.

777
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:03,916
The fridge is full of worms!

778
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,042
Ugh.

779
00:57:06,878 --> 00:57:10,006
We saw the mooring for a boat
on our way in, but no boat.

780
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:12,341
My dad's here. He's just on
the other side of the island.

781
00:57:13,217 --> 00:57:14,260
Oh, right.

782
00:57:17,263 --> 00:57:19,056
You sure you want to keep lying?

783
00:57:19,307 --> 00:57:20,892
I've gutted fish bigger than you.

784
00:57:22,769 --> 00:57:25,772
Where's your other accomplice?
Where's Edmund?

785
00:57:25,938 --> 00:57:29,358
The boy?
No, he's not one of us.

786
00:57:29,484 --> 00:57:31,486
No, he's just some runaway.

787
00:57:31,611 --> 00:57:34,572
Ever notice how people think their problems
won't follow them wherever they go?

788
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:38,451
That's why I always like to make sure
I tie up loose ends.

789
00:57:38,826 --> 00:57:41,037
Hey. They don't even have a TV.

790
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:44,248
Oh, you poor girl! How
do you pass the time?

791
00:57:44,415 --> 00:57:46,125
I read!

792
00:57:47,126 --> 00:57:50,088
Do you really want to come between
me and my pay day?

793
00:57:50,296 --> 00:57:53,257
You really want to call
my best friend a pay day?

794
00:57:55,343 --> 00:57:56,719
Oh!

795
00:57:57,303 --> 00:57:59,097
Go, Selk!
Get out of here!

796
00:58:06,187 --> 00:58:08,106
Oh, you're brave, I'll give you that.

797
00:58:08,523 --> 00:58:10,608
Do you know what happens
to brave little girls?

798
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,026
No, neither do I.

799
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:13,778
They don't live long enough
to tell their tales.

800
00:58:15,154 --> 00:58:17,907
Now, you gonna let me
take your seal here?

801
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:19,283
Sea lion.

802
00:58:20,201 --> 00:58:21,244
You can't save her.

803
00:58:21,327 --> 00:58:23,329
Better to give in
than watch me hurt her, hey?

804
00:58:24,163 --> 00:58:26,624
Come on, don't feel so bad.

805
00:58:26,707 --> 00:58:29,043
You're unarmed, outnumbered.
Not a lot of choice, really.

806
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:34,048
I'm not giving up.
I'll figure something out.

807
00:58:39,345 --> 00:58:40,596
Go, Selkie, go!

808
00:58:42,014 --> 00:58:44,851
Thanks for training her so well.
Circus pays extra for that.

809
00:58:46,227 --> 00:58:47,895
Pack it up, boys. We're casting off!

810
00:58:47,979 --> 00:58:49,355
- What?
- We're leaving, idiot.

811
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,815
- What?
- I said...

812
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:54,277
Always had a feeling
we'd find something worthwhile here.

813
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,445
Something big.

814
00:58:59,657 --> 00:59:04,078
Just remember, you try to follow me,
you pull any of your other little tricks

815
00:59:04,162 --> 00:59:05,538
and I take it out on your pet.

816
00:59:07,457 --> 00:59:09,292
A dead seal's better than no seal.

817
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,820
We just don't have any legal recourse
to reverse the sale.

818
00:59:39,947 --> 00:59:44,327
But if there was something else
unique about the island

819
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,037
besides the protozoa.

820
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:57,131
What if there were several
habitats for endangered species?

821
00:59:57,548 --> 00:59:59,258
I don't have any
documentation for it yet,

822
00:59:59,383 --> 01:00:01,094
but I know my daughter has seen...

823
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,262
We can't get an extension
based on the word of a child.

824
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:05,348
I'm starving. What about a break?

825
01:00:05,431 --> 01:00:08,643
Fourth floor, there's a vending machine
with a very tasty selection.

826
01:00:10,895 --> 01:00:12,897
<i>Jack, you have to come home.</i>

827
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,024
<i>I can't find Felix.
And there are poachers...</i>

828
01:00:15,108 --> 01:00:16,651
Nim's in trouble.
I've gotta go.

829
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:18,611
You go. I'll do what I can here.

830
01:00:18,694 --> 01:00:21,572
And ask my granddaughter
to come and visit me one day, will you?

831
01:00:21,697 --> 01:00:23,199
She looks more and more like Emily.

832
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:25,868
My daughter would have been
very proud of you today, you know.

833
01:00:25,993 --> 01:00:27,161
I know.

834
01:00:29,956 --> 01:00:31,749
It's a long shot,
but Emily would have tried.

835
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:40,758
"Get out of the lab, Felix"!

836
01:00:40,842 --> 01:00:42,802
"Do some field work"!

837
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:48,141
Is this what you meant
by "embrace the chaos," Jack?

838
01:00:55,523 --> 01:00:57,233
When you come across my bones

839
01:00:57,316 --> 01:01:01,028
picked clean by all
manner of claw and fang

840
01:01:01,112 --> 01:01:04,282
I hope you feel terrible for luring me

841
01:01:04,365 --> 01:01:08,745
to this island to participate
in ground-breaking scientific research

842
01:01:08,828 --> 01:01:15,585
when you knew, you knew
I'd be scraped, stung, rained upon.

843
01:01:15,668 --> 01:01:18,963
Tormented by lawless children
and laughed at

844
01:01:19,046 --> 01:01:22,675
by psychopathic
pirate-theme resort developers!

845
01:01:27,597 --> 01:01:29,015
Have at me, bird!

846
01:01:29,098 --> 01:01:30,475
Do your worst!

847
01:01:34,061 --> 01:01:36,105
Well, what do you know!

848
01:01:38,357 --> 01:01:40,693
Now I don't suppose you could
recommend a good optometrist?

849
01:01:47,325 --> 01:01:48,367
Wait a minute.

850
01:01:56,959 --> 01:01:59,337
Rope's not the only thing
that's gonna burn around here.

851
01:02:19,398 --> 01:02:22,610
Nim, you okay?

852
01:02:30,701 --> 01:02:32,954
What happened?

853
01:02:33,037 --> 01:02:35,373
They took Selkie.

854
01:02:35,456 --> 01:02:37,375
He had a knife and I couldn't...

855
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:39,252
Oh, no.

856
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:51,472
Selkie's my best friend.

857
01:02:51,556 --> 01:02:53,474
More than that.

858
01:02:53,558 --> 01:02:57,562
She's been there for me
every day since my mom died.

859
01:02:57,645 --> 01:02:59,230
She's family.

860
01:03:01,149 --> 01:03:03,609
- What if we can...
- We can't call for help.

861
01:03:05,361 --> 01:03:07,947
We can't go after them.

862
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:10,658
All the boats are gone.

863
01:03:10,742 --> 01:03:12,452
There's nothing we can...

864
01:03:13,703 --> 01:03:15,872
That little kleptomaniac.

865
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,501
Hey, these are Booker's boat keys.

866
01:03:22,295 --> 01:03:24,714
- Which means...
- There's still time to save Selkie.

867
01:03:30,011 --> 01:03:31,262
We need to be prepared.

868
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:34,140
Let's check the lab.
Maybe we'll find something labelled,

869
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:36,267
"Take Out Maniacal Poachers Kit"!

870
01:03:43,524 --> 01:03:45,651
Who are you and what
have you done with Felix?

871
01:03:45,985 --> 01:03:48,070
Felix went into the field, Nim.

872
01:03:48,154 --> 01:03:49,989
I'm what the field spat back out.

873
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:53,451
Great, because we could really use your help.
We're under attack.

874
01:03:53,534 --> 01:03:55,286
You think? I'm all over it.

875
01:03:57,121 --> 01:04:00,166
Okay. A, love the initiative.
Don't lose that.

876
01:04:00,249 --> 01:04:03,836
But B, Jack would never sign off on us
shooting them with poison darts

877
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,964
and leaving their bodies
to be picked apart by rabid warthogs.

878
01:04:07,048 --> 01:04:10,009
I find, in moments like these,
it's best to ask...

879
01:04:10,093 --> 01:04:11,469
"What would Alex Rover do?"

880
01:04:34,283 --> 01:04:35,868
Come on!

881
01:04:44,419 --> 01:04:47,797
We ready?
ls Mission No Circus for Selkie a go?

882
01:04:51,801 --> 01:04:54,178
Give us a speech, fearless leader.

883
01:04:55,012 --> 01:04:57,265
Oh.

884
01:04:57,348 --> 01:04:59,225
I'm not.

885
01:04:59,308 --> 01:05:01,519
I mean, I don't know what to say.

886
01:05:03,896 --> 01:05:07,150
Except that Selkie makes a much
better friend than sideshow act.

887
01:05:09,152 --> 01:05:10,820
And those guys won't stop

888
01:05:10,903 --> 01:05:16,284
until they've put everything
that crawls, flies and swims in a cage.

889
01:05:16,868 --> 01:05:19,036
I don't know how things work
on the mainland,

890
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,539
but we don't stand for
that kind of thing here.

891
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:24,834
I say we put them in a cage.

892
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:26,627
Yeah! Cage them!

893
01:05:36,637 --> 01:05:38,723
Now I know why
you're so grumpy, Frankie.

894
01:05:38,806 --> 01:05:39,891
Being ugly hurts.

895
01:05:41,142 --> 01:05:43,144
Oh, now, look at that. See, Frankie?

896
01:05:43,227 --> 01:05:45,563
Even the dumb seal knows
it's important to keep fit.

897
01:05:45,938 --> 01:05:47,148
Hey, Frankie.

898
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:50,234
Bad enough you lost my keys, but how
long does it take to hotwire a boat?

899
01:05:50,568 --> 01:05:53,654
Any longer we'll be peddling
a seal carcass to the Russkies.

900
01:05:53,738 --> 01:05:55,490
They're not going to fall
for that trick again.

901
01:05:58,826 --> 01:06:00,536
Why would a bird want keys?

902
01:06:00,703 --> 01:06:02,872
See, those are Dad's keys.

903
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:04,457
I made that keychain myself.

904
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:08,669
Ripped the tooth out of the shark
that got your mom.

905
01:06:10,171 --> 01:06:13,591
That's what happens to animals
who mess with Booker and son.

906
01:06:13,674 --> 01:06:15,218
Sons.

907
01:06:15,301 --> 01:06:16,677
Shut up, Frankie, you'll scare him.

908
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,433
I thought we didn't
want any lorikeets?

909
01:06:22,517 --> 01:06:25,144
Don't overthink it, Ben.
Just chase the pretty bird.

910
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:29,774
Dad, these trees keep hitting me!

911
01:06:29,857 --> 01:06:32,527
You keep running into them,
dummy. Open your eyes.

912
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:35,113
They are open! Stupid bees.

913
01:06:35,196 --> 01:06:37,782
Quiet, Frankie!
What'd I say about spooking the bird?

914
01:06:37,865 --> 01:06:39,909
Yeah, we're losing
the element of surprise.

915
01:07:00,096 --> 01:07:01,597
Phase One complete.

916
01:07:06,727 --> 01:07:07,812
Oh!

917
01:07:07,895 --> 01:07:10,731
Why couldn't we have kept that bird
in the cage when we had the chance?

918
01:07:10,815 --> 01:07:11,858
Shut up, Frankie!

919
01:07:17,238 --> 01:07:19,490
Why'd the stupid lorikeet
have to fly down the path

920
01:07:19,574 --> 01:07:21,659
with the pooping birds
and the angry leaves?

921
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:24,454
Yeah.

922
01:07:24,537 --> 01:07:26,414
Why don't you two guys go on ahead?

923
01:07:39,552 --> 01:07:41,345
Selk, you in here?

924
01:07:41,429 --> 01:07:43,222
She has to be close by.

925
01:07:43,306 --> 01:07:46,434
Wait. I can't leave them here.
Not again.

926
01:07:51,439 --> 01:07:52,732
This might work better.

927
01:07:59,322 --> 01:08:00,531
What?

928
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:02,617
I play a lot of video games.

929
01:08:06,954 --> 01:08:09,874
That's right,
bring them to Papa Bear.

930
01:08:09,957 --> 01:08:11,584
Papa's got claws now.

931
01:08:16,339 --> 01:08:18,382
Come on!

932
01:08:18,466 --> 01:08:19,675
Why are you so smug?

933
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,011
You're supposed to lead them
into the quicksand.

934
01:08:37,318 --> 01:08:38,569
Felix was right!

935
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:40,363
Liquid nitrogen is so useful!

936
01:08:40,488 --> 01:08:41,823
So is my old-school
machete.

937
01:08:45,535 --> 01:08:47,578
Where'd the bird go?

938
01:08:47,662 --> 01:08:50,039
Forget the bird. We've got these.

939
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:53,793
Hey, Frankie, look.
It's the nerd from the net.

940
01:08:53,876 --> 01:08:56,629
You're gonna have a very different name
for me when I get through with you.

941
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,674
Like Felix the Ferocious.

942
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:03,052
Feral Felix. No! The Frightful Felix.

943
01:09:06,597 --> 01:09:07,807
- Quicksand!
- What?

944
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:09,016
Quicksand!

945
01:09:11,936 --> 01:09:13,688
Move your foot!

946
01:09:16,607 --> 01:09:19,944
Get ready to have sand in
all the wrong places, boys.

947
01:09:24,907 --> 01:09:27,243
Guess that's the last time you'll mess
with a marine biologist

948
01:09:27,326 --> 01:09:28,995
with a focus in psychology.

949
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,627
Thanks for the backup,
but I totally had the situation covered.

950
01:09:44,427 --> 01:09:47,305
- Selkie!
- Selkie! Selkie!

951
01:09:47,388 --> 01:09:48,639
Selk!

952
01:09:58,775 --> 01:10:00,693
Selkie.

953
01:10:00,777 --> 01:10:02,862
Nim! Nim!

954
01:10:02,945 --> 01:10:04,739
Nim, I've found her.

955
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,210
She's overheated.

956
01:10:17,293 --> 01:10:18,669
We have to get her to the water.

957
01:10:18,753 --> 01:10:20,004
How?

958
01:10:20,088 --> 01:10:22,381
I know I'm stronger than I look,
but even I can't carry her.

959
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:25,968
Can you drive that?

960
01:10:27,053 --> 01:10:28,221
But Arbie has the keys.

961
01:10:28,304 --> 01:10:30,098
No, Arbie has the keychain.

962
01:10:34,811 --> 01:10:36,145
Go, go, go!

963
01:10:46,197 --> 01:10:47,657
Keep going!

964
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,291
Almost there.

965
01:11:00,545 --> 01:11:02,672
Straighten out, Edmund! Into the bay!

966
01:11:44,255 --> 01:11:46,048
Two more hours of daylight.

967
01:11:46,132 --> 01:11:47,967
Ready to get out there with your camera?

968
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:50,970
- Can we nap first?
- No time.

969
01:11:51,053 --> 01:11:53,931
Operation No Circus for Selkie
was an unmitigated success,

970
01:11:54,015 --> 01:11:56,642
but the Buccaneers
will be here tomorrow.

971
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:58,895
First we'll head back
to the grasslands for the Bilby.

972
01:11:58,978 --> 01:12:00,021
Nim.

973
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:02,023
Push play.

974
01:12:04,942 --> 01:12:07,779
<i>Never make
direct eye contact with the Bilby.</i>

975
01:12:07,862 --> 01:12:09,572
<i>A ferocious creature,</i>

976
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:13,034
<i>they're known for shocking people
to death with adorableness.</i>

977
01:12:13,117 --> 01:12:14,285
You sneak!

978
01:12:14,368 --> 01:12:16,245
That means we only need one more.

979
01:12:16,746 --> 01:12:19,749
I know just where to look,
but Jack won't like it.

980
01:12:34,388 --> 01:12:36,057
Nim!

981
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,850
Nim!

982
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:44,524
Nim? You up there?

983
01:12:52,281 --> 01:12:53,950
Where are you?

984
01:13:15,138 --> 01:13:17,682
Sorry, Jack, but it's the only way.

985
01:13:20,017 --> 01:13:21,602
What'd you say?

986
01:13:37,326 --> 01:13:38,828
- Felix?
- You're back?

987
01:13:38,911 --> 01:13:41,080
And, sir, gotta say the new look is...

988
01:13:41,164 --> 01:13:42,707
Felix, where's Nim?

989
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:44,751
Felix, where is she?

990
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:46,627
See, I was supposed to
watch these poachers here while...

991
01:13:46,711 --> 01:13:48,504
- Poachers?
- Cormorant Cliffs.

992
01:13:51,007 --> 01:13:53,050
If you want me to resign my post I will,

993
01:13:53,134 --> 01:13:55,094
but I've come to learn
how to embrace the chaos of life!

994
01:14:11,486 --> 01:14:13,488
Use your arms and your legs!

995
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:16,991
You're doing great!

996
01:14:17,075 --> 01:14:20,453
The sharp rocks below are more
scared of you than you are of them!

997
01:14:20,536 --> 01:14:23,206
Why would you bring up
sharp rocks at a time like this?

998
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:25,750
Come on, Edmund.
Where's your sense of humour?

999
01:14:29,212 --> 01:14:30,671
I'm too crippled by fear to laugh.

1000
01:14:30,755 --> 01:14:32,924
Okay, watch out for
loose rocks through here.

1001
01:14:36,302 --> 01:14:40,056
Just think, the climb down
is going to be much easier.

1002
01:14:40,139 --> 01:14:42,809
The sun will be setting,
the bats will be out.

1003
01:14:42,892 --> 01:14:44,060
It'll be beautiful!

1004
01:14:48,606 --> 01:14:49,649
Oh!

1005
01:14:52,276 --> 01:14:55,196
- You're heavier than you look.
- Thanks.

1006
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:58,116
I've been trying to fill out

1007
01:14:58,241 --> 01:15:01,994
so I can play football next year.

1008
01:15:05,415 --> 01:15:06,707
Sorry.

1009
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:09,377
Seems like I'm always
messing up your big plans.

1010
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:12,588
No, this wouldn't be
half as much fun without you.

1011
01:15:21,305 --> 01:15:22,849
This is fun?

1012
01:15:26,519 --> 01:15:29,188
Are you sure there aren't
any endangered species

1013
01:15:29,272 --> 01:15:31,858
who live in nice, safe,
low to ground places?

1014
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:16,778
Okay.

1015
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,782
Let's, uh... Let's lure this iguana out
for its close-up.

1016
01:16:22,325 --> 01:16:23,951
I mean, a week ago baiting iguanas

1017
01:16:24,118 --> 01:16:26,204
with candy would have
seemed crazy to me.

1018
01:16:26,287 --> 01:16:28,247
What was so different a week ago?

1019
01:16:29,332 --> 01:16:32,168
Well, I was planning
my adventure on your island,

1020
01:16:32,251 --> 01:16:33,669
not living it.

1021
01:16:34,962 --> 01:16:37,507
There are lots of places you could
have run away to for an adventure.

1022
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:40,009
Yeah, I know, but this
island has everything.

1023
01:16:42,136 --> 01:16:46,599
Friendly natives, angry poachers,
terrifying cliffs.

1024
01:16:46,682 --> 01:16:48,392
Why run away at all?

1025
01:16:59,362 --> 01:17:02,323
I had to get away from my parents.

1026
01:17:02,407 --> 01:17:04,283
Why would you want to do that?

1027
01:17:06,369 --> 01:17:07,412
Uh...

1028
01:17:07,537 --> 01:17:09,122
Well, they fight.

1029
01:17:11,499 --> 01:17:13,042
All the time.

1030
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:19,132
Dad lost his business

1031
01:17:19,257 --> 01:17:24,053
and Mum's afraid

1032
01:17:24,137 --> 01:17:26,222
of what's going to happen to us.

1033
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:33,604
I was tired of feeling totally useless.

1034
01:17:37,442 --> 01:17:39,193
Sol left.

1035
01:17:41,112 --> 01:17:42,655
Which I know is stupid,

1036
01:17:42,739 --> 01:17:46,951
because they're probably beyond worried
about me, but...

1037
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:48,327
Edmund,

1038
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:51,414
I don't think you're useless or stupid.

1039
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:55,418
I think you're...

1040
01:17:58,337 --> 01:17:59,547
I'm...

1041
01:18:17,273 --> 01:18:21,152
Nim Rusoe, you've just found
your first Fijian Crested Iguana.

1042
01:18:22,195 --> 01:18:24,405
That's three species. The island's safe.

1043
01:18:32,288 --> 01:18:34,707
- How did it?
- it's a defence mechanism.

1044
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:37,126
We must have scared it.

1045
01:18:37,293 --> 01:18:38,461
Sorry, little guy.

1046
01:18:42,381 --> 01:18:46,260
Hey! Stop it!
There's an endangered species down here!

1047
01:18:46,344 --> 01:18:49,263
Funny, I see three endangered species.

1048
01:18:50,014 --> 01:18:51,516
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1049
01:18:51,599 --> 01:18:53,184
There's nowhere to hide out there.

1050
01:18:54,477 --> 01:18:55,686
Come on. Come on.

1051
01:19:04,404 --> 01:19:07,448
It just keeps getting
smaller and smaller.

1052
01:19:08,032 --> 01:19:09,075
Are you okay?

1053
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:10,660
You know
how you feel about heights?

1054
01:19:11,494 --> 01:19:14,455
That's how I feel about tight,
cramped spaces.

1055
01:19:14,539 --> 01:19:15,581
Really?

1056
01:19:16,124 --> 01:19:17,917
This is roomy compared
to my place in Brisbane.

1057
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,503
Stop trying to be funny! We're trapped.

1058
01:19:21,546 --> 01:19:23,297
Which is exactly what
Alex Rover always thinks

1059
01:19:24,507 --> 01:19:26,175
right before he makes
his miraculous escape.

1060
01:19:26,259 --> 01:19:28,344
Without ropes, we'll never
get out of here before the fire comes.

1061
01:19:28,428 --> 01:19:29,804
Nim, Nim, look at me.

1062
01:19:30,763 --> 01:19:32,348
Hey, we're gonna get out of here.

1063
01:19:35,351 --> 01:19:36,894
We're going to save the island.

1064
01:19:38,104 --> 01:19:39,147
We can do this.

1065
01:19:42,525 --> 01:19:43,735
Here.

1066
01:19:44,652 --> 01:19:46,529
Hurry, it's getting crispy in here.

1067
01:19:49,157 --> 01:19:50,241
That's it!

1068
01:19:57,832 --> 01:19:59,876
You go. You're a better climber.

1069
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:06,424
Go.

1070
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:08,760
Nim!

1071
01:20:08,843 --> 01:20:11,888
I guess we finally find out
what happens to brave little girls.

1072
01:20:15,057 --> 01:20:16,392
Huh?

1073
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:23,649
Their fathers ground them
for the rest of their lives.

1074
01:20:38,498 --> 01:20:41,501
Nim, I just want you to know we did
everything we could to save the island,

1075
01:20:41,584 --> 01:20:43,711
- but it looks like we're going to have to...
- Show him, Edmund.

1076
01:20:43,836 --> 01:20:45,338
Show me? Show me what?

1077
01:20:50,051 --> 01:20:52,929
- Is that...
- A Fijian Crested Iguana?

1078
01:20:53,012 --> 01:20:54,680
And that's our third species, too.

1079
01:20:54,764 --> 01:20:56,140
We've got them all in there.

1080
01:20:56,224 --> 01:20:58,434
The Bilby is particularly
well documented.

1081
01:20:58,518 --> 01:21:00,186
Nim, this changes everything.

1082
01:21:00,269 --> 01:21:02,313
You are amazing.

1083
01:21:02,396 --> 01:21:05,149
And, Edmund, you're
starting to grow on me.

1084
01:21:05,233 --> 01:21:06,901
Yeah, he does that.

1085
01:21:07,568 --> 01:21:09,278
I'm her best human friend.

1086
01:21:09,362 --> 01:21:11,656
Third overall after
Selkie and Fred.

1087
01:21:12,365 --> 01:21:14,158
At least I trump Arbie.

1088
01:21:17,203 --> 01:21:19,122
I wonder if they'll let
Moira visit me in prison.

1089
01:21:19,205 --> 01:21:22,500
Oh, she's going to get one look at you
and your ugly mug and dump you.

1090
01:21:22,959 --> 01:21:25,878
And I'm telling the authorities
that you two put me up to everything.

1091
01:21:25,962 --> 01:21:27,046
Oh, shove it, Frankie!

1092
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:29,424
The Coast Guard arrested all of us
because we're a family.

1093
01:21:29,507 --> 01:21:31,092
Booker and sons stick together.

1094
01:21:31,175 --> 01:21:33,761
Sons?
What, so now we're a family?

1095
01:21:38,224 --> 01:21:40,184
Come on, don't keep a girl hanging.

1096
01:21:54,866 --> 01:21:56,826
You're so gonna miss us.

1097
01:21:56,993 --> 01:21:58,995
Are you kidding?
I'm going to miss everything.

1098
01:22:00,246 --> 01:22:01,456
The island,

1099
01:22:02,582 --> 01:22:03,666
sunshine,

1100
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,793
my freedom.

1101
01:22:08,129 --> 01:22:09,714
I'm so grounded when I get home.

1102
01:22:38,242 --> 01:22:42,580
Hey, um, so before I leave

1103
01:22:42,955 --> 01:22:45,500
I just wanted to, uh,
uh, tell you that...

1104
01:22:46,584 --> 01:22:47,627
Mmm-hmm?

1105
01:22:48,836 --> 01:22:51,672
Um...Well, see, I...

1106
01:22:53,299 --> 01:22:54,550
Felix!

1107
01:22:55,551 --> 01:22:56,594
Wake up!

1108
01:22:59,555 --> 01:23:01,724
Oh, you're truly evil.

1109
01:23:01,849 --> 01:23:05,144
And you can expect a whole lot more
where that came from.

1110
01:23:05,228 --> 01:23:07,105
I just told my professor
I'm staying for another semester.

1111
01:23:07,188 --> 01:23:08,898
Just enough time to get
plenty of revenge.

1112
01:23:09,482 --> 01:23:10,566
Hmm.

1113
01:23:20,201 --> 01:23:22,161
Stellar performance, buddy.

1114
01:23:23,287 --> 01:23:26,457
You don't know how much
I'm going to miss you.

1115
01:23:29,752 --> 01:23:31,129
Okay, so...

1116
01:23:31,838 --> 01:23:33,256
Sol made you this.

1117
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:37,552
It's papaya in the shape of a Gummy.

1118
01:23:38,886 --> 01:23:40,138
See?

1119
01:23:40,221 --> 01:23:41,681
I hope you like it.

1120
01:23:41,764 --> 01:23:43,224
What's my email?

1121
01:23:45,309 --> 01:23:48,729
Nim@rusoesanctuary
forrareandendangeredspecies.com.

1122
01:23:54,444 --> 01:23:55,987
So as I was trying to say before,

1123
01:23:57,822 --> 01:24:00,742
this was just, like,
the best week of my life, and...

1124
01:24:02,285 --> 01:24:04,704
- We almost died, like, 12 times.
- I know.

1125
01:24:05,705 --> 01:24:08,666
But, um...

1126
01:24:14,714 --> 01:24:18,009
- Uh, you...
- Whatever it is, spit it out.

1127
01:24:25,475 --> 01:24:26,517
Hmm...

1128
01:24:34,108 --> 01:24:35,568
Weirdo.

1129
01:24:38,946 --> 01:24:41,365
Edmund! Gotta get going.

1130
01:24:41,449 --> 01:24:43,993
Don't want to miss the tide
or you'll be stuck here another day.

1131
01:25:28,579 --> 01:25:31,541
Shut up, you. He's just a friend.

1132
01:26:12,039 --> 01:26:14,459
<i>"Hello there,
my favourite invader.</i>

1133
01:26:14,542 --> 01:26:17,378
<i>"I bet you're already missing
my island desperately.</i>

1134
01:26:17,879 --> 01:26:21,758
<i>"Well, before you get any ideas
about storming Turtle Beach again</i>

1135
01:26:21,841 --> 01:26:23,843

you a heads-up.</i>

1136
01:26:23,926 --> 01:26:26,095

the horizon,</i>

1137
01:26:26,387 --> 01:26:28,931
<i>"because I might invade
your island next."</i>

1138
01:26:29,305 --> 01:27:29,176
