Max.

00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:56,809
My emergency stash of Who Hash?

103
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:59,812
And my secret slew
of frozen Beezle-Nut stew?

104
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:04,783
I specifically bought enough
food to last until January.

105
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:07,586
How much emotional eating
have I been doing?

106
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:18,029
No. I won't. I will not.

107
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:20,732

Ugh!

112
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:33,711
Fine. But I'm going to despise

113
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:35,646
every second of it.

114
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:38,183
Come on, Max.

115
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:42,586
<i>Yes, the Grinch
hated Christmas,</i>

116
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:44,889
<i>the whole Christmas season.</i>

117
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:47,658
<i>Now, please don't ask why.</i>

118
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,793
<i>No one quite knows the reason.</i>

119
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:51,962
<i>It could be his head</i>

120
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:54,698
<i>wasn't screwed on just right.</i>

121
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,133
<i>It could be perhaps that</i>

122
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:59,636
<i>his shoes were too tight.</i>

123
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:02,772
<i>But I think the most likely
reason of all</i>

124
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:05,042
<i>may have been that his heart</i>

125
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:08,047
<i>was two sizes too small.</i>

126
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:15,718
Now, remember, Max,

127
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,820
this is the time of year
when the Whos

128
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:19,689
are at their most deceptive.

129
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:21,691

as says one kind word to us.

Uh-uh.

184
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:11,357
Blech!

185
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:21,031
Ah. What's this?

186
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,365
Excuse me.

187
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:23,900
Are you getting that?

188
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:26,169
I need it
for my Christmas stuffing.

189
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:28,773
Mmm... no.

190
00:10:29,908 --> 00:10:32,177
Well, that's not very nice.

191
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,113
Oh, sugarplum!

192
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,688
<i>Oh, no, I can't today.
I have a list of errands</i>

193
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,691
a mile long, and the babysitter
left the sink backed up.

194
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:50,860
No, I-I'm not complaining.
I'm venting.

195
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:52,194
There's a difference.

196
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:53,729
Okay. Uh, talk to you later.

197
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,764
I-I have to get breakfast
on the table.

198
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:59,767
Right after I unclog
this drain again.

199
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:01,903
Ugh! It's like concrete!

200
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:04,906
- Cindy-Lou, sweetheart, come eat.
- Coming!

201
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:07,178
Oh.

202
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:12,481
Buster,
we've talked about this.

203
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:15,016
- Huh?
- Your brother's head is not breakfast.

204
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:19,287
Uh?

205
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:20,722
Blah!

206
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:26,027
Ah!

207
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,002
Okay.

208
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:36,870
You all right, Mom?

209
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:39,006
Me? Oh. Yes. Never better.

210
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:42,042
Ah. What'd you put down here
anyway, a roller skate?

211
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:44,512
No. Just batter.
Me and Ms. Wilbur made cookies.

212
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:46,514
Oh. That explains it.

213
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:48,348
- Come have some eggs.
- I can't.

214
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,517
I gotta go mail something.
But I made the beds

215
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,286
and put away the twins' toys.

216
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:54,922
Thanks, sweetheart.
You didn't have to do that.

217
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:56,356
I don't mind.

218
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:58,959
- Something's burning.
- Just a second, sweetie.

219
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:01,861
Bean, don't feed your brother
with your feet.

220
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:03,530
- Mom! The toast!
- I got it!

221
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,508
Wait. Where are you
going again?

222
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,776
- I told you. To mail a letter.
- Okay,

223
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,411
but just come here first.

224
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:20,315
Mom. I gotta go.

225
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,218
All right.

226
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,818
Mwa!

227
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,121
Okay. Now you can go.

228
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,822
Thanks, Mom.
Bye, Buster. Bye, Bean.

229
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:32,458
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

230
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,527
Roger that, Mom.

231
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:37,330
Whoo!

232
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:40,333
Here goes Cindy-Lou Who
as she dashes through the snow

233
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:42,867
with a very important letter!

234
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:45,237
Oh, no!
I'm gonna miss the mailman!

235
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,105
Shortcut!

236
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:49,507
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

237
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,243
Whoo! Whoa! Whoa!

238
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:52,844
Whoa!

239
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:55,380
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

240
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:56,814
Bon appétit!

241
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:57,949
Whoo-hoo!

242
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:01,819
Oh, no!

243
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:03,020
Whoo!

244
00:13:03,022 --> 00:13:04,224
Aah...

245
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:06,924
Watch out!

246
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:08,892
Aah! Oh!

247
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:10,294
No! My letter!

248
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:12,162
What is wrong with you?

249
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:13,931
Didn't you see me?
I mean, if that...

250
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:16,233
if that was a sled, I-I...
well, I'd be dead.

251
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:18,902
I'm sorry for bumping into you,
but this is really important.

252
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:21,005
Have you seen my letter?

253
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:23,173
And that right there, Max,
is the true nature

254
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:25,609
of the Who child:
just right to "me, me, me.

255
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:28,178
- My letter. Me, me, me."
- No, you don't understand.

256
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,048
This isn't just a letter.
This is the letter.

257
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,049
Oh... really?

258
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:35,586
Let me guess.
Small child, December 20,

259
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:38,589
rabidly searching for a
"really important" lost letter?

260
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:42,058
Might it be your list
of demands to Santa?

261
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,128
They're not demands.
It's more like a wish.

262
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,531
And what I'm wishing for
is really, really important.

263
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,967
Well, then why send a letter?
I mean, if it's really

264
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:53,169
that important, you should
just ask him face-to-face.

265
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:57,006
Oh, but that's right:
no one's ever seen him.

266
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:59,242
Mmm, my bad.

267
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:02,010
Come on, Max,
let's get out of here.

268
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:04,182

You old feisty frosty.

00:15:08,444 --> 00:15:10,009
Here, come on,
let me help you up.

291

Oh. "Hair dye.

00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:16,149
Gorgeous Green Goddess."

294
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:18,318
Oh. How did that get in there?

295
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,487
Hey, I'm sorry
if I made you uncomfy.

296
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:23,156
We all got to keep
the gray away.

297
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:26,159
I myself use
Chocolate Explosion.

298
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:28,628
You know what? If you want
to apologize for something,

299
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,663
apologize for that.

300
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:34,434
My eyes are burning.

301
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:36,669
Well, don't-don't blame me.
Haven't you heard?

302
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:40,072
The mayor wants Christmas to be
three times bigger this year.

303
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:41,974
That means
three times the lights,

304
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:44,243
three times the eggnog,
three times the...

305
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:47,012
Information needed.

306
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:48,514
That's a good one.

307
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:49,749
Oh, I get it.

308
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:52,184
This is one of
your kidding things.

309
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:54,086
Finally, something
you said is...

310
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:56,221
actually funny.

311
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,557
Yeah, I do kid a lot,
but no, this is actually...

312
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,260
- Christmas three times bigger!
- Well, you're just gonna have

313
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:03,228
- a good time with this, aren't you?
- Oh-ho, dear.

314
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,464
- Oh, no, no, no, I-I-I-I...
- I gotta say, it's really nice

315
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,599
- to see you laughing.
- Sorry, I-I can't hear you.

316
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,267
I don't speak ridiculous.

317
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,269
Oh, you're a scream.

318
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,371
- Have a nice life. Good-bye.
- I'll see you later.

319
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,540
Whew! Oh, man.

320
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,577
Mr. Grinch.

321
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,673
I'm gonna stay awake
to see Santa!

322
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,748
<i>From the edge of his ledge,</i>

323
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,717
<i>way up in the sky,</i>

324
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,719
<i>the Grinch felt upset,</i>

325
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,254
<i>though he wasn't sure why.</i>

326
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:07,289
<i>It could've been Christmas,</i>

327
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,559
<i>all that joy and the such,</i>

328
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,061
<i>or some thoughts from his past</i>

329
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,497
<i>that he just
couldn't quite touch.</i>

330
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:16,632
<i>But whatever it was,</i>

331
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,501
<i>it made his heart moan.</i>

332
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:22,304
<i>Though he was used to it now,</i>

333
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:24,807
<i>this being alone.</i>

334
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,443
<i>And now safe in his cave,</i>

335
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:29,645
<i>and apart from the fray,</i>

336
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:32,348
<i>he reminded himself...</i>

337
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,584
It is better this way.

338
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,397
That's right, yeah.

339
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:52,634
Just right there.
No. No, not on your brother.

340
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,302
Let Mommy do it.

341
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:58,473
Whoa! Whoa...

342
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:00,341
Cindy-Lou!

343
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:01,543
Don't worry, Mom.

344
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:08,348
Aah.

345
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:12,787
I'm wearing four ski jackets.

346
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:15,155
Four jackets?
Aren't you a little hot?

347
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:17,491
Yep. Sweatin' a little bit.

348
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:19,493
Are you going somewhere?

349
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:21,495
- North Pole.
- Oh. Wow.

350
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:23,497
Any, uh, particular reason?

351
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:25,699
- I got to talk to Santa.
- Santa, huh?

352
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:27,901
Yeah. It's really important.

353
00:18:27,903 --> 00:18:31,438
Well, it must be if you need
to go see him in person.

354
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,140
- It sure is.
- Okay, then. Well, good luck,

355
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:37,276
and I guess I'll see you
in about a month.

356
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:41,915
Wait. It takes a whole month
to get to the North Pole?

357
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,650
Oh, yeah. At least.

358
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:45,919
Christmas will be over
by the time I got there.

359
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:49,655
Ah, that's true. Now, we
would miss you at Christmas.

360
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:54,160
Wow. I guess I'm gonna have
to come up with another plan.

361
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:55,828
Hey, maybe while
you're thinking,

362
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,230
you could put the halo
on the angel.

363
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:00,199
Okay.

364
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:02,301
You want to take
your jackets off?

365
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:04,269
Yeah, at least
one or two of them.

366
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:08,340
No, boys, don't pull
the angel's wings off.

367
00:19:08,342 --> 00:19:10,377
She needs those.

368
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:19,484
♪ Five gold rings... ♪

369
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,426

370
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:30,729
what do you want to do today?

371

00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:41,640

374
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:44,575
Ooh. I got one.

375
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,008
All right, all right,
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,676
You're a good dog.

377
00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:56,978
But a bad drummer.

378
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:00,617
What would you like to do?

379
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:06,456
More than embarrassing
to be beaten by a dog.

380
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:09,691
Oh. What's that?

381
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:15,763
And checkmate. Again.

382
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,971
What in the world is happening?

383
00:21:40,857 --> 00:21:43,023
What is that?!

384
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:45,358
It's the most
beautiful Christmas tree

385
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
you've ever seen!

386
00:21:47,362 --> 00:21:48,895
Three times bigger?

387
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:51,664
Th-Th-That's
a hundred times bigger!

388
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh, you just wait
till we light it tonight.

389
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:56,970
It'll sparkle so bright,
you'll be celebrating Christmas

390
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:59,072
with the rest of us! Ho-ho!

391
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:02,408
Oh, man, I can't wait!

392
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,409
I'm gonna keep at it.

393
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:06,579
- I'll see you later, Grinchy.
- No.

394
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:08,580
You will not see me later!

395
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:10,582
And I will not be celebrating!

396
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:11,885
And that tree...

397
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:14,921
that... tree...

398
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:18,592
has got to go.

399
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:38,442
- Come on, Mom!
- Cindy-Lou, look over there.

400
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:41,113
- Wow! That's amazing!
- Thank you.

401
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,917
Ooh, a three-eyed sock monster!

402
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:47,052
Awesome robot.

403
00:22:47,054 --> 00:22:51,455
Oh, how
marvelous this time of year is.

404
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:56,127
Welcome, Who-ville, to the
annual tree-lighting ceremony.

405
00:22:56,129 --> 00:22:59,997
How spectacular
are these ornaments?

406
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:02,033
Look what I made, everybody.

407
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:04,035
It's a Christmas dragon.

408
00:23:04,037 --> 00:23:06,037
It came to me in a dream.

409
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,506
Oh, man.

410
00:23:09,943 --> 00:23:12,509
- Hey, Bartholomew.
- Hey there, Ms. Who.

411
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:14,411
- Here you go.
- Got it.

412
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:17,048
Find a good spot for it.

413
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,582
There it goes.

414
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:33,429
Now, let's get ready
to flip that switch

415
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:35,531
and light up the sky!

416
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:37,133
Oh-ho, no.

417
00:23:37,135 --> 00:23:39,736
Not on my watch, you don't.

418
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:41,737
See you guys soon.
Gonna go find Groopert.

419
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:44,506
Okay. Have fun. Bye. Say "bye."

420
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:48,044
Here you go. I hope your big
brother gets what he deserves.

421
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:49,778
Hey, Groopert.
How's business?

422
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,780
Good. What I can't sell...

423
00:23:51,782 --> 00:23:53,517
I can always eat.

424
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,053
I need to talk to you about
something really important.

425
00:23:58,055 --> 00:24:00,491
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

426
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:07,229
All right,
check this out, Groopert.

427
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:09,564
I'm gonna stay up
on Christmas Eve this year

428
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,233
and meet Santa Claus.

429
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:13,735
Whoa, that is crazy!

430
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:16,171
Yeah, I really got
to talk to him.

431
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:17,739
About what?

432
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:19,974
Well, it's really personal.

433
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:24,246
But I'm going to tell you,
because you're my best friend.

434
00:24:24,248 --> 00:24:26,180
It's about my mom.

435
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:30,084
She works all night
and takes care of us all day.

436
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:32,120
And it just isn't fair.

437
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:35,590
She acts like she's fine...

438
00:24:35,592 --> 00:24:39,227
but I know,
it's really hard for her.

439
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:43,865
So I figured, if anyone
could fix that, it'd be Santa.

440
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:46,800
Wow. And I just asked him
for a turtle.

441
00:24:46,802 --> 00:24:48,802
Here we go!

442
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:52,206
- Oh. It's starting!
- Okay, Who-ville, it is time

443
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:55,542
to light this beautiful tree.

444
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:58,946
...17, 18, 19 and 20.

445
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:04,219
Okay. Lock and load.

446
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,789
All right,
just attach this here,

447
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,791
and we'll be ready to launch.

448
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:17,097
I know.
I wish I could see

449
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,965
the look on their faces...

450
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:21,534
Whoa!

451
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:24,136
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

452
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:26,772
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Hold on, hold on! Aah!

453
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:28,209
Whew! Oh, boy.

454
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:31,879
Whoa... okay, oh, boy.

455
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,985
That could've been
so much worse.

456
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:41,153
Aah...!

457
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,290
Let's begin the countdown.

458
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:48,593
Ten! Nine!

459
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:51,163
Eight! Seven!

460
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:52,697
Six!

461
00:25:52,699 --> 00:25:55,000
Five! Four!

462
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:57,068
- Three! Two!
- Hey!

463
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,770
My dragon can fly!

464
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:00,805
- One!
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

465
00:26:03,143 --> 00:26:04,609
Oh, my.

466
00:26:04,611 --> 00:26:06,077
No, no, no, no. No!

467
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,179
No! No! Aah!

468
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:20,791
- Whoa!
- Wow!

469
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:23,294
Oh, it's beautiful.

470
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:24,828
There it is.

471
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:29,600
The most beautiful tree
Who-ville has ever seen.

472
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:31,702
Oh, oh! No! No!

473
00:26:31,704 --> 00:26:33,137
Everyone,

474
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:35,305
have a wonderful season.

475
00:26:40,812 --> 00:26:43,213
No.

476
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:45,215
No.

477
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:47,251
<i>He walked through the crowd,</i>

478
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:48,485
<i>and the sound and the lights...</i>

479
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:51,120
♪ Ring-a-round the rosies,
a pocket full of posies... ♪

480
00:26:51,122 --> 00:26:54,223
<i>...and his ears heard the thump
of their joy and delights.</i>

481
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:58,628
<i>And it took him right back
to his earliest years,</i>

482
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:03,833
<i>to that lost, lonely boy
who cried all of those tears.</i>

483
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:06,269

00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:08,805
<i>isolated and sad,</i>

485
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:11,140
<i>with no home of his own,</i>

486
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:13,844
<i>no mom and no dad.</i>

487
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,217
<i>And as the Grinch
looked around,</i>

488
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:23,921
<i>he felt downright scared...</i>

489
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:27,789
<i>...as he remembered
that Christmas</i>

490
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:30,425
<i>where nobody cared.</i>

491
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:32,894
<i>Where nobody showed,</i>

492
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:35,063
<i>not even a flea.</i>

493
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:37,065
<i>And there were no cards,</i>

494
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:39,767
<i>no gifts and no tree.</i>

495
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,674
<i>And as he watched other kids...</i>

496
00:27:46,676 --> 00:27:51,313
- Woop!
- <i>...one thing became clear:</i>

497
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:55,983
<i>that this was the single
worst day of the year.</i>

498
00:27:58,821 --> 00:28:01,856
<i>And now here it was,
that day once again,</i>

499
00:28:01,858 --> 00:28:05,059
<i>and he felt all those feelings
he felt way back when,</i>

500
00:28:05,061 --> 00:28:07,194
<i>when he'd watch
Whos young and old</i>

501
00:28:07,196 --> 00:28:09,930
<i>all sit down to feast,
and they'd feast,</i>

502
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:11,365
<i>and they'd feast,</i>

503
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:13,766
<i>and they'd feast,
feast, feast, feast.</i>

504
00:28:15,037 --> 00:28:17,204
<i>They'd feast on Who-pudding</i>

505
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:19,973
<i>and rare Who roast beast.</i>

506
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:24,244
<i>Which is something the Grinch
could not stand in the least.</i>

507
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:26,980
<i>And then they'd do something</i>

508
00:28:26,982 --> 00:28:29,382
<i>he liked least of all.</i>

509
00:28:29,384 --> 00:28:32,418
<i>Every Who down in Who-ville,
the tall and the small,</i>

510
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,022
<i>would stand close together
with Christmas bells ringing.</i>

511
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:37,723
<i>They'd stand hand in hand,</i>

512
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:40,393
<i>and the Whos
would start singing.</i>

<i>Yes, he couldn't recall</i>

525
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,424
<i>without feeling the sting.</i>

526
00:29:12,426 --> 00:29:15,260
<i>So the Grinch
finally declared...</i>

527
00:29:15,262 --> 00:29:19,132
I must stop this whole thing.

528
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:31,209
Why?

529
00:29:31,211 --> 00:29:34,512
For 53 years,
I've put up with it.

530
00:29:34,514 --> 00:29:36,780
Now...

531
00:29:36,782 --> 00:29:41,085
I must stop this Christmas
from coming.

532
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:42,353
But how?

533
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:53,330
<i>Then he got an idea.</i>

534
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:55,899
<i>An awful idea.</i>

535
00:29:55,901 --> 00:30:00,036
<i>The Grinch got
a wonderful, awful idea.</i>

536
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:03,442
<i>I know just what to do.</i>

537
00:30:05,077 --> 00:30:09,045
<i>I'm going to steal
their Christmas.</i>

538
00:30:17,154 --> 00:30:19,221
All the trimmings,

539
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:21,223
all the trappings,

540
00:30:21,225 --> 00:30:24,260
all their gifts and garlands!

541
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:27,029
When they wake
and see it's gone,

542
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:31,100
then all their joy and
happiness will be gone as well.

543
00:30:33,271 --> 00:30:35,371
So prepare yourself, Max.

544
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:37,239
For tomorrow...

545
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:40,944
We begin!

546
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:24,318
Genius starts
with the abs, Max.

547
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:28,522
It's go time.

And now...

553
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:41,934
the question we
have all been waiting for:

554
00:31:41,936 --> 00:31:44,504
How will I steal Christmas?

555
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:49,141
Well, prepare to have
your little doggy mind blown.

556
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:50,278
Poof.

557
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:01,520
Ta-da!

558
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:03,522
That's right,

559
00:32:03,524 --> 00:32:05,624
I become...

560
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:08,227
Santa Claus.

561
00:32:08,229 --> 00:32:10,396
But instead of giving

562
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:13,332
all the joy and happiness,
I'll take it away.

563
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:16,602
If he can deliver Christmas to
the whole world in one night,

564
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:21,039
then I can certainly steal it
from little old Who-ville.

565
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:23,174
I mean, come on.

566
00:32:23,176 --> 00:32:25,944
What's Santa have that I don't?

567
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,280
That's hurtful.

568
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:32,050
Um, what are you doing

569
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:33,718
with my bowling ball?

570
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,187
Chasing it.

571
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:37,522
And you're taking it where?

572
00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:39,457
- It's a secret.
- All right.

573
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,393
But not without
breakfast. Catch!

574
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:44,262
Whoa! Waffles! My favorite!

575
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:46,063
Thanks! See you guys later!

576
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:48,600
Here we go.

577
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:51,469
- Hey, Cindy-Lou.
- Oh, hey there, Mr. Cubbins.

578
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,309
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

579
00:32:58,645 --> 00:32:59,979
Woot, woot.

580
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:05,551
- Ready.
- All right. Let's go.

581
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,055
Whoa!

582
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,328
Hold on!

583
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,330
Whoo!

584
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,668
Yeah!

585
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,010
Let's go, let's go.
Let's move.

586
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,613
Hang on.

587
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,485
- Whoo!
- And... dismount.

588
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,792
So, what do we know?

589
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,127
Waffles are delicious.

590
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:54,564
Super delicious. But I meant
about meeting Santa.

591
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,265
We know no one's ever done it.

592
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:58,366
Hmm...

593
00:33:58,368 --> 00:34:00,368
Okay. How about this?

594
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,370
I'm going to sit
in the living room

595
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:05,140
with my eyes wide open
like this,

596
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:09,144
and if I start to drift off,
I'll just open them wider!

597
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:12,112
Um, I'm pretty sure
you're gonna fall asleep.

598
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:14,549
- And by the time you wake up...
- He'll be gone.

599
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:17,151
Nothing but cookie crumbs.

600
00:34:17,153 --> 00:34:19,153
Yeah, you're right.

601
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:21,155
- I got it!
- Tell me!

602
00:34:21,157 --> 00:34:22,657
Maple syrup.

603
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,559
All right, maple syrup.

604
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:26,795
We pour it on the roof,
the reindeer get stuck,

605
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:28,629
and then they can't fly away.

606
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:29,798
Science!

607
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,665
Won't the syrup just freeze?

608
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:33,434
- Good point.
- Also, how do we get

609
00:34:33,436 --> 00:34:35,302
all that syrup on the roof?

610
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:36,770
Yeah, I got nothing.

611
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:41,275
Wait a minute.

612
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:44,177
- I think I got it.
- What?

613
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,681
We're gonna need
the whole gang for this one.

614
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:49,115
Okay.

615
00:34:49,117 --> 00:34:50,518
If I'm going to become Santa,

616
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,654
then I need to get
into character.

617
00:34:55,357 --> 00:34:57,357
All right, let's see.

618
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,358
"Christmas Tree."

619
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,492
"Christmas Traditions."

620
00:34:59,494 --> 00:35:00,861
"Christmas Pudding."

621
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:03,096
How does pudding work its way
into everything?

622
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:05,098
Where is the Santa stuff?

623
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,700
Look at this.
Little girls and boys giggling

624
00:35:07,702 --> 00:35:09,469
over sugarplums.

625
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:10,603
Oh.

626
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:12,305
Look how they did the roof

627
00:35:12,307 --> 00:35:15,375
of the gingerbread house
with vanilla icing.

628
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:18,245
Little... family of gumdrops.

629
00:35:21,415 --> 00:35:22,749
So dumb.

630
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:24,485
So, so stupidly dumb.

631
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,786
Ah, here we are.

632
00:35:26,788 --> 00:35:28,554
"The Legend of Santa Claus."

633
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:30,522
Red suit, white beard,

634
00:35:30,524 --> 00:35:32,858
always in a jolly mood.

635
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,427
Oh. That's not gonna happen.

636
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:37,229
Oh, well.
Let's just start

637
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:39,733
by finding ourselves
some reindeer.

638
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:50,274
Beautiful.
Isn't it, Max?

639
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:52,176
This, my little friend,

640
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:54,412
is the Rein-Horn.

641
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:57,682
It perfectly re-creates the
mating call of the reindeer.

642
00:35:57,684 --> 00:35:59,450
Behold.

643
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,460
Oh. Hey there.

644
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:11,862
Sorry, little goat.
I was calling for a rein...

645
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,900
What was that?!

646
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:17,802
Scram! Skedaddle!

647
00:36:17,804 --> 00:36:19,804
Strange goat.

648
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:23,406
Now, reindeer migrate,

649
00:36:23,408 --> 00:36:26,409
so maybe we'll catch a few
headed south for the winter.

650
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:28,678
I also read that they tend
to mate in densely wooded...

651
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,781
Will you stop following us?!

652
00:36:31,783 --> 00:36:34,284
Shoo! Away! Go back to the goat farm.

653
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:35,819
Go eat a can.

654
00:36:38,557 --> 00:36:41,558
All right, now that that's
over, back to the task at hand.

655
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,894
Whew! It's a little crisp.

656
00:36:44,896 --> 00:36:47,296
Oh, it's getting...

657
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:49,499
really... c-cold.

658
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:52,301
Oh, goodness!

659
00:36:52,303 --> 00:36:53,737
Can't...

660
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:55,939
feel my lips.

661
00:36:55,941 --> 00:36:57,941
Can't... blink.

662
00:36:57,943 --> 00:37:00,476
Eyes... frozen!

663
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:05,547
Max...

664
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:09,318
we've hit the mother lode.

665
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:12,488
We'll have 100 reindeer

666
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,791
to pull our...

667
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,805
Huh?

668
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:34,742
Well, Santa had eight.

669
00:37:34,744 --> 00:37:37,512
He looks like he ate
the other seven.

670
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:40,950
Watch and learn, Max.

671
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:43,720
All right.

672
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:08,975
Aah!

673
00:38:10,546 --> 00:38:11,778
Uh-oh.

674
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,815
Aah!

675
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:14,950
Aah!

676
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:28,627
Aah! Frozen, stinkin'...

677
00:38:28,629 --> 00:38:30,429
Stop. Stop.

678
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:34,667
Onward, my furry friends.

679
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:38,404
We're walking toward destiny.

680
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:47,949
- Let's get in there!
- Whoo-hoo!

681
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:51,784
All right, you called, we came.

682
00:38:51,786 --> 00:38:54,019
- So what's up?
- Yeah, what's the deal?

683
00:38:54,021 --> 00:38:56,021
Thanks for getting here
so fast, guys.

684
00:38:56,023 --> 00:38:57,892
Follow me.

685
00:38:59,593 --> 00:39:01,693
So, what's the big secret?

686
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:04,796
Yeah, I don't have very long.
My parents set the timer.

687
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:07,632
- Dude.
- Don't ask. It's new.

688
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:10,468
All right, everybody,
brace yourselves.

689
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,937
In exactly 48 hours,

690
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:17,542
we are going to do something
that's never been done before.

691
00:39:17,544 --> 00:39:19,476
We're gonna...

692
00:39:19,478 --> 00:39:21,813
trap Santa Claus!

693
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:23,413

♪ Is coming... ♪

695
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,521
Trap Santa?
Why would we want to do that?

696
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:32,689
Duh. To steal all his toys.
I love it.

697
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:34,125
- Oh, yeah!
- That's a great idea!

698
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:36,393
No, not to steal his toys.

699
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:38,629
To, um, to talk to him.

700
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:41,832
- What? Why do you want to talk to him?
- It's personal.

701
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:44,568
- Yeah, it's kind of personal.
- Well, I don't want

702
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,435
to do it if you
won't tell me why.

703
00:39:46,437 --> 00:39:48,437
- What are you talking about, "personal"?
- Axl,

704
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:51,108
when you asked to borrow $16
and my mom's suitcase,

705
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,143
did I ask you why?

706
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:55,511
- No.
- And what about you, Ozzy?

707
00:39:55,513 --> 00:39:57,413
Remember when you
got stuck in that...

708
00:39:57,415 --> 00:39:59,016
All right, all right, okay.
Geez.

709
00:39:59,018 --> 00:40:01,151
I did it
because you're my friend,

710
00:40:01,153 --> 00:40:02,952
and when something
matters to you,

711
00:40:02,954 --> 00:40:05,089
that means it matters to me.

712
00:40:06,624 --> 00:40:08,891
- That's beautiful.
- Okay, okay, okay.

713
00:40:08,893 --> 00:40:10,493
You convinced me.

714
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:12,628
- Count me in, too.
- All right, we're in.

715
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,797
- Great! Now, let's do this.
- Yeah, let's do this!

716
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:16,032
- Oh, yeah! Awesome!
- Let's make it happen.

717
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:17,432
Whoa, cool.
That is so cool.

718
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:19,869
- To the bikes!
- Yeah!

719
00:40:26,577 --> 00:40:28,710
- Cindy-Lou! Dinnertime!
- Let's go, guys! Dinnertime!

720
00:40:28,712 --> 00:40:30,412
- Time to eat!
- Ooh, dinner.

721
00:40:30,414 --> 00:40:32,148
All right, we meet
first thing in the morning.

722
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,748
- Okay.
- All right, see you tomorrow.

723
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,017
- See you guys in the morning.
- Ozzy! Timer!

724
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,953
Okay, Mom.

725
00:40:52,836 --> 00:40:54,970
This is the loudest snow

726
00:40:54,972 --> 00:40:57,438
I've ever heard in my life.

727
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,473
You two, go around the back.

728
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:02,877
Wait for me to drop
the sleigh from the roof. Okay?

729
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,780
Go, team.

730
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:21,130
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

731
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:30,670

00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:12,210

00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:39,128
but I think I just saw
Santa Claus.

764
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,632
Let me get another piece.

765
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,170
Today was great.

766
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:50,372
We did mean things,

767
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:53,208
and we did them in style.

768
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:57,012
Max, you know the rules.

769
00:43:57,014 --> 00:43:58,646
You sleep in your bed,

770
00:43:58,648 --> 00:44:01,015
and I sleep in...

771
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:03,918
Oh, no, no, not you, too.
I don't believe this.

772
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,254
Max, did you teach him
puppy eyes?

773
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:14,228
Fine.

774
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,230
This one time.

775
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,813
Ah...

776
00:44:32,815 --> 00:44:34,714
Ah.

777
00:45:37,878 --> 00:45:41,746
Mmm! Now, that is
a great cup of coffee.

778
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:49,187
Max, this morning, you and I
need to do some recon.

779
00:45:49,189 --> 00:45:51,755
Fred, you just sit right there.

780
00:45:51,757 --> 00:45:53,258
And don't touch anything.

781
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:57,162
Intel, Max,
that's what we're after.

782
00:45:57,164 --> 00:45:59,029
How many houses are
in Who-ville,

783
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:00,431
and how many Whos?

784
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:03,967
How many wreaths and trees
and chimney flues?

785
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,236
I'll be in your ear
the whole time,

786
00:46:06,238 --> 00:46:07,371
and whatever you're seeing,

787
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:09,806
I'll be seeing on the monitor.

788
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,408
Ready? Now, off you go, Max.

789
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:13,377
Fly, boy.

790
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:15,078
Fly!

791
00:46:23,355 --> 00:46:26,490
Max, stop socializing.

792
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:30,061
Now, let's go in for a look.

793
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:33,963
Okay, six houses on Oak Street.

794
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:35,131
Oh, watch out!

795
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:36,933
Wha...?

796
00:46:36,935 --> 00:46:40,203
- Huh.
- Okay, go. Go, go, go.

797
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:42,471
Now, cut through Main Street
and survey the south side.

798
00:46:42,473 --> 00:46:44,173
Merry Christmas!

799
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:46,309
Look at those
greedy little gift monsters,

800
00:46:46,311 --> 00:46:49,811
loading themselves up
with Christmas junk.

801
00:46:49,813 --> 00:46:52,215
- Okay, Max, turn right here.
- Whoa!

802
00:46:52,217 --> 00:46:54,816
So I woke up this morning,
got dressed, had my coffee,

803
00:46:54,818 --> 00:46:56,252
went outside,
looked on the roof.

804
00:46:56,254 --> 00:46:57,953
My sleigh was gone.

805
00:46:57,955 --> 00:46:59,955
My, my, I wonder who took it.

806
00:47:01,392 --> 00:47:03,426
Okay, let's see here.
If we do...

807
00:47:03,428 --> 00:47:05,026
28 houses an hour

808
00:47:05,028 --> 00:47:07,563
for six hours,
that would be sausages.

809
00:47:07,565 --> 00:47:08,930
Sausages?!

810
00:47:08,932 --> 00:47:11,969
Max! Don't even think about it.

811
00:47:15,472 --> 00:47:16,473
Max!

812
00:47:20,077 --> 00:47:21,276
Max, are you okay?

813
00:47:21,278 --> 00:47:22,910
Max?

814
00:47:22,912 --> 00:47:24,212
Oh, hey, look, it's me.

815
00:47:24,214 --> 00:47:26,248
Oh, dear. Aah!

816
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,882
Bad dog.

817
00:47:28,884 --> 00:47:31,421
Fred, we're home!

818
00:47:32,422 --> 00:47:34,855
Fred...?

819
00:47:34,857 --> 00:47:37,224
What are you... doing?

820
00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:43,230
Okay.

821
00:47:43,232 --> 00:47:45,334
Come on, we got work to do.

822
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:50,106
Now, let's plan our route.

823
00:47:52,275 --> 00:47:54,575
First, now, we go south,
quick jaunt to the east,

824
00:47:54,577 --> 00:47:57,478
and then this house, skip
the subdivision for the moment,

825
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,381
knock off the entire
southeast quadrant of the town,

826
00:48:00,383 --> 00:48:02,616
and then we finish it all up...

827
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:05,385
on Whistling Who Lane.

828
00:48:05,387 --> 00:48:07,920
That's 223 houses

829
00:48:07,922 --> 00:48:10,490
and only seven hours
of darkness to work with.

830
00:48:10,492 --> 00:48:14,327
That means we have to be
fast and focused.

831
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:18,031
And believe you me,
there will be temptation...

832
00:48:18,033 --> 00:48:20,133
all around us.

833
00:48:20,135 --> 00:48:22,468
♪ Raindrops on roses ♪

834
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,437
♪ And whiskers on kittens... ♪

835
00:48:24,439 --> 00:48:26,306
Behold! The present.

836
00:48:26,308 --> 00:48:28,374
This is our enemy.

837
00:48:28,376 --> 00:48:30,942
You will want to unwrap it.

838
00:48:30,944 --> 00:48:34,379
And... play with it.

839
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:36,081
♪ These are a few ♪

840
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,482
♪ Of my favorite things... ♪

841
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:40,185
But you must not!

842
00:48:40,187 --> 00:48:42,287
And if you can get past
the present,

843
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:44,525
the only obstacle left is...

844
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:48,894
...the cookie.

845
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:51,496
Look at it in all
its red, sugary splendor.

846
00:48:52,899 --> 00:48:54,633
No, no, no.
Look at yourselves.

847
00:48:54,635 --> 00:48:56,603
Discipline. We must...

848
00:49:00,106 --> 00:49:02,474
...resist.

849
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:05,309
- Are you ready?
- Almost.

850
00:49:05,311 --> 00:49:07,178
Good. Think jolly.

851
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,547
- And fat.
- Okay, I'm ready.

852
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:11,317
All right, quick.
Everybody, hide.

853
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:14,118
Three, two, one,

854
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,386
cue Santa!

855
00:49:15,388 --> 00:49:18,089
That means you, Groopert.

856
00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:25,463
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Look at this pretty house.

857
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:27,631
I will leave presents
for the people.

858
00:49:27,633 --> 00:49:29,567
Come on, it's not
the school play, dude.

859
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:32,335
- Then why do I have to wear the outfit?
- Groopert!

860
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:34,170
Focus. Just get the cookie!

861
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:36,540
But I can see the strings.

862
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:38,642
Stop worrying.
It'll be dark at night.

863
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:40,543
What if he has a flashlight?

864
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:42,712
Have you ever seen a picture
of Santa with a flashlight?

865
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:44,514
- No, but I just...
- Groopert,

866
00:49:44,516 --> 00:49:46,282
just pick up the cookie!

867
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:49,119
Hmm. What do we have here?

868
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:51,922
A delicious little cookie.

869
00:49:54,126 --> 00:49:55,291
Aah!

870
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,329
Groopert!

871
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:00,095
Groopert?

872
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,131
Uh, hey, guys.

873
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:05,602
Do I still get to eat
the cookie?

874
00:50:08,607 --> 00:50:13,976
All right, so I tinkered
with our sleigh a bit.

875
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:15,446
Behold!

876
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:27,489
Look at this, Max.

877
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,024
Now you'll be riding in style.

878
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:32,293
A throne for a barking prince.

879
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,762
How do you like that?

880
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:38,099
All right, Fred,
you are the engine

881
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,567
of this great machine.

882
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:40,769
Understood?

883
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,703
Good.

884
00:50:42,705 --> 00:50:45,239
Now, remember,
this is just a practice run,

885
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:47,375
but on this team
we practice like we play.

886
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,146
So let's leave it all
out on the snow.

887
00:50:52,515 --> 00:50:55,416
Oh! Okay!

888
00:50:55,418 --> 00:50:59,219
All right, how about that?

889
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:02,222
Now, let's pick up the pace
and see how she handles.

890
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:03,691
Oh, ho-ho!

891
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:09,196
Hang on!

892
00:51:09,198 --> 00:51:11,631
No, no, no. No problem.

893
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:13,569
It's all... under control.

894
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:18,207
Whoa!

895
00:51:20,075 --> 00:51:21,374
Aah!

896
00:51:26,248 --> 00:51:27,246
Aah!

897
00:51:33,454 --> 00:51:35,822
We're doing it, Max.
We are doing it!

898
00:51:35,824 --> 00:51:38,125
We will not be...

899
00:51:39,627 --> 00:51:41,560
...stopped?

900
00:51:41,562 --> 00:51:43,729
What happened? Fred?

901
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:46,699
Oh, um...

902
00:51:46,701 --> 00:51:49,435
sorry, but we don't need
any more reindeer.

903
00:51:49,437 --> 00:51:51,770
No. Go. Get. Shoo.

904
00:51:51,772 --> 00:51:53,539
I have what I need.

905
00:52:12,526 --> 00:52:14,728
It's okay, Fred.

906
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:36,881
On our own again, Max.

907
00:52:42,421 --> 00:52:45,289
<i>It was the day
before Christmas,</i>

908
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:47,357
<i>and the Whos were abuzz,</i>

909
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,561
<i>all doing the things
that a Christmas Who does.</i>

910
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:56,198
<i>Some were out buying presents,
others just milled about.</i>

911
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,802
- There you go, sir.
- <i>But the whole town felt joyous,</i>

912
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:00,904
<i>of that there was no doubt.</i>

913
00:53:00,906 --> 00:53:05,308
<i>The weather was perfect,
and soon snow would fall.</i>

914
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:06,877
- <i>This surely would be...</i>
- All right, everyone ready?

915
00:53:06,879 --> 00:53:09,880
<i>...the best Christmas of all.</i>

916
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,292
Max! There you are.

917
00:53:23,294 --> 00:53:24,694
Check this out.

918
00:53:24,696 --> 00:53:26,429
Whoa! Ah.

919
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:28,931
I've been making
lots of cool... Whoa!

920
00:53:28,933 --> 00:53:31,801
...stuff!

921
00:53:31,803 --> 00:53:33,535
Ooh, more coffee.

922
00:53:35,238 --> 00:53:37,773
It's gonna be a big night.

923
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:39,875
We got all the gizmos
and gazmos we need,

924
00:53:39,877 --> 00:53:42,444
but we still don't have
the proper outfit.

925
00:53:42,446 --> 00:53:45,547
Come on, let's do
a little stitching.

926
00:53:45,549 --> 00:53:47,782

Max?

935
00:54:17,313 --> 00:54:19,313
Do you know what you are?

936
00:54:19,315 --> 00:54:21,915
You are a sturdy little fella.

937
00:54:23,419 --> 00:54:25,319
And loyal.

938
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:26,687
Very loyal.

939
00:54:26,689 --> 00:54:30,456
In fact, I think
you're the best dog

940
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:32,826
a Grinch could hope for.

941
00:54:32,828 --> 00:54:34,862
And that is why...

942
00:54:34,864 --> 00:54:37,397
I'm promoting you.

943
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,901
Max...

944
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:44,539
you will guide
my sleigh tonight.

945
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,878
Ha-ha!

946
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,582
I knew you
wouldn't let me down.

947
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:01,654
<i>It was now Christmas Eve.</i>

948
00:55:01,656 --> 00:55:03,690
<i>There was joy in the air.</i>

949
00:55:03,692 --> 00:55:07,693
<i>For in just a few hours,
Santa Claus would be there.</i>

950
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:11,630
<i>And the gifts would be left,
and the stockings all filled.</i>

951
00:55:11,632 --> 00:55:13,632
<i>And the anticipation,</i>

952
00:55:13,634 --> 00:55:16,902
<i>well, it started to build.</i>

953
00:55:16,904 --> 00:55:18,904
Ozzy, what are you doing?

954
00:55:18,906 --> 00:55:21,273
Trying... to get...
myself tired.

955
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:25,043
All right, eight hours
till Christmas morning.

956
00:55:25,045 --> 00:55:27,579
That's 28,800 seconds.

957
00:55:27,581 --> 00:55:30,015
Okay, and... sleep!

958
00:55:30,017 --> 00:55:32,017
Waffle One, this is Waffle Two.

959
00:55:32,019 --> 00:55:33,852
Are you there? Over.

960
00:55:33,854 --> 00:55:36,520
I read
you loud and clear, Waffle Two.

961
00:55:36,522 --> 00:55:39,057
- This is Groopert, by the way.
- Yeah, I got that.

962
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:41,927
Oh. I just wanted
to wish you good luck

963
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:45,496
- with Santa Claus.
- Thanks. Talk tomorrow.

964
00:55:45,498 --> 00:55:49,433
So, you got any
last-minute wishes for Santa?

965
00:55:49,435 --> 00:55:52,002
Yep. I have one great big wish.

966
00:55:52,004 --> 00:55:55,806
Good. Because you deserve
everything you want and more.

967
00:55:55,808 --> 00:55:57,508
Thanks, Mom.

968
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,944
I want the same thing for you.

969
00:55:59,946 --> 00:56:03,948
How did I end up
with such a wonderful daughter?

970
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:06,083
I don't know.
Sometimes you just get lucky.

971
00:56:06,085 --> 00:56:07,918
Well, then I really did.

972
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,486
Me, too.

973
00:56:09,488 --> 00:56:10,888
I love you, Mom.

974
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,858
I love you, sweetheart.

975
00:56:13,925 --> 00:56:16,261
- Good night.
- Good night.

976
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:42,584
<i>The Grinch was now
ready to start his big trip.</i>

977
00:56:42,586 --> 00:56:45,654
<i>He stood like a captain
aboard a great ship.</i>

978
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:49,625
<i>Yes, the time had now come
to take off like a shot.</i>

979
00:56:49,627 --> 00:56:51,059
Here we go, Max.

980
00:56:51,061 --> 00:56:53,762
Let's see what you've got!

981
00:56:53,764 --> 00:56:56,000
Hyah!

982
00:56:59,469 --> 00:57:00,969
What?

983
00:57:00,971 --> 00:57:03,471
Max?

984
00:57:03,473 --> 00:57:05,009
Max, are you okay?

985
00:57:06,043 --> 00:57:07,377
Huh?

986
00:57:14,484 --> 00:57:15,983
Yeah, Max!

987
00:57:15,985 --> 00:57:17,418
Attaboy!

988
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,686
Go, boy! Go!

989
00:57:20,423 --> 00:57:22,623
<i>And down the Grinch came</i>

990
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:25,059
<i>on his great fateful ride,</i>

991
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:27,695
<i>toward the good homes
of Who-ville</i>

992
00:57:27,697 --> 00:57:30,430
<i>and the Christmas inside.</i>

993
00:57:37,706 --> 00:57:40,540
<i>He had planned it
and prepped it,</i>

994
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:42,344
<i>big detail to small.</i>

995
00:57:44,479 --> 00:57:46,980
<i>Yes, he'd get rid
of Christmas now,</i>

996
00:57:46,982 --> 00:57:49,482
<i>once and for all.</i>

997
00:57:49,484 --> 00:57:52,487
You take the outside,
I'll take the inside.

998
00:57:59,928 --> 00:58:02,130
House number one.

999
00:58:18,012 --> 00:58:20,012
<i>He was ready to pounce</i>

1000
00:58:20,014 --> 00:58:22,147
<i>and set the score right.</i>

1001
00:58:22,149 --> 00:58:25,684
<i>He'd make up for the past,
and he'd do it tonight.</i>

1002
00:58:25,686 --> 00:58:26,886
Okay...

1003
00:58:26,888 --> 00:58:29,054
now, let's steal Christmas.

1004
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,523
<i>He swept up their presents</i>

1005
00:58:32,525 --> 00:58:34,093
<i>with the speed of a wiz.</i>

1006
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:36,929
<i>And he knew he'd cause sadness.</i>

1007
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:40,101
<i>Only theirs now, not his.</i>

1008
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:19,937
<i>All this excess and nonsense,</i>

1009
00:59:19,939 --> 00:59:21,705
<i>it was all about greed.</i>

1010
00:59:21,707 --> 00:59:23,273
<i>About meaningless stuff</i>

1011
00:59:23,275 --> 00:59:26,009
<i>that they didn't even need.</i>

1012
00:59:26,011 --> 00:59:27,713
Yeah.

1013
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:36,086
<i>The Grinch went to work.</i>

1014
00:59:36,088 --> 00:59:37,254
<i>He scooped up the toys.</i>

1015
00:59:37,256 --> 00:59:42,827
<i>He raced against time.
He raced against joy.</i>

1016
00:59:46,831 --> 00:59:48,698
<i>He hit a few snags</i>

1017
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,700
<i>as he made his way through.</i>

1018
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:54,003
<i>An angry orange cat...</i>

1019
00:59:54,005 --> 00:59:55,938
<i>and a sleepwalking Who.</i>

1020
00:59:57,275 --> 00:59:58,540
Huh?

1021
01:00:03,815 --> 01:00:05,716
Thank you, Mommy.

1022
01:00:07,085 --> 01:00:08,850
<i>He stole pop guns and bicycles,</i>

1023
01:00:08,852 --> 01:00:10,585
<i>roller skates, drums,</i>

1024
01:00:10,587 --> 01:00:13,855
<i>checker boards, tricycles,
popcorn and plums.</i>

1025
01:00:15,726 --> 01:00:19,094
<i>Gadgets and gizmos,
and dolls with strange names,</i>

1026
01:00:19,096 --> 01:00:22,764
<i>goofballs and shloof-balls
and video games.</i>

1027
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,227
<i>And he swiped and he poached.</i>

1028
01:00:53,229 --> 01:00:55,829
<i>Yes, the stealing was on.</i>

1029
01:00:55,831 --> 01:00:58,065
<i>And this day that he hated,</i>

1030
01:00:58,067 --> 01:01:01,636
<i>well, he made it be gone.</i>

1031
01:01:06,075 --> 01:01:09,111
This is it, the last house.

1032
01:01:16,252 --> 01:01:18,885
♪ Mmm, mmm,
dashing through the snow ♪

1033
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:21,687
♪ In a one-dog open sleigh ♪

1034
01:01:24,092 --> 01:01:27,796
♪ One more house to go,
and Christmas goes away. ♪

1035
01:01:30,999 --> 01:01:32,832
Ha!

1036
01:01:39,006 --> 01:01:40,239
Huh?

1037
01:01:42,776 --> 01:01:44,144
Oh, what the heck?

1038
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,179
Ah.

1039
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:48,280
Huh?

1040
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,651
He's here!

1041
01:01:52,653 --> 01:01:54,088
Whoa. What the...?

1042
01:01:55,756 --> 01:01:58,656
Aah! Whoa. Whoa! Aah!

1043
01:02:08,268 --> 01:02:10,170
How do I get out of this?

1044
01:02:11,205 --> 01:02:14,272
Santa Claus.

1045
01:02:14,274 --> 01:02:16,073
Oh. Uh, hello.

1046
01:02:16,075 --> 01:02:18,075
A little help, please?

1047
01:02:18,077 --> 01:02:19,777
I'll let you down.
Just give me a minute.

1048
01:02:19,779 --> 01:02:21,846
Oh, that would be great.

1049
01:02:21,848 --> 01:02:24,148
I'm coming.
Just trying to remember...

1050
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,150
which cord it is.

1051
01:02:26,152 --> 01:02:27,318
Oh, no!

1052
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,886
I'm so sorry.

1053
01:02:28,888 --> 01:02:30,154
Are you okay?

1054
01:02:30,156 --> 01:02:32,389
Yeah. I-I guess so.

1055
01:02:32,391 --> 01:02:35,326
Let me help you.

1056
01:02:35,328 --> 01:02:38,095
Sit down here.

1057
01:02:38,097 --> 01:02:40,264
- Whew.
- Drink this.

1058
01:02:40,266 --> 01:02:43,467
It'll make you feel better.

1059
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:45,704
Uh... thanks.

1060
01:02:47,706 --> 01:02:50,874
Wow. I can't believe
it's really you.

1061
01:02:50,876 --> 01:02:52,742
Uh... yeah.

1062
01:02:52,744 --> 01:02:55,311
I'm so sorry about the trap
and everything,

1063
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,013
but I really need...

1064
01:02:57,015 --> 01:02:59,351
Hey. Why are you taking
our Christmas tree?

1065
01:03:01,286 --> 01:03:02,784
Well...

1066
01:03:02,786 --> 01:03:04,853
uh, one of the lights
wasn't working,

1067
01:03:04,855 --> 01:03:07,490
so I thought I'd
take it back to the workshop

1068
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,126
and see if I could fix it.

1069
01:03:10,128 --> 01:03:11,994
I didn't know you did that.

1070
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:13,496
Yeah. Sure.

1071
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,332
Now, why don't you
go back upstairs to bed,

1072
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,333
and then when you wake up,
the tree will be fixed

1073
01:03:18,335 --> 01:03:20,102
- and your presents will be waiting under it.
- Wait.

1074
01:03:20,104 --> 01:03:22,004
You don't understand.
I don't want presents.

1075
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:24,840
Of course you do.
Everyone wants presents.

1076
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:28,377
No, no, really, I don't.
I want you to help my mom.

1077
01:03:28,379 --> 01:03:30,212
Y-Your mom?

1078
01:03:30,214 --> 01:03:33,215
Yeah. She works so hard

1079
01:03:33,217 --> 01:03:36,185
and is always doing stuff
for other people.

1080
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:39,288
And I just want her
to be happy.

1081
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,989
You want me to help...
your mom?

1082
01:03:41,991 --> 01:03:43,991
You're Santa.

1083
01:03:43,993 --> 01:03:45,993
You make people happy.

1084
01:03:45,995 --> 01:03:50,064
And everyone
should be happy, right?

1085
01:03:50,066 --> 01:03:52,333
Y-Yeah, I...

1086
01:03:52,335 --> 01:03:55,102
I guess they should.

1087
01:03:55,104 --> 01:03:56,437
Santa,

1088
01:03:56,439 --> 01:03:59,040
are... are you okay?

1089
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:00,041
What?

1090
01:04:00,043 --> 01:04:02,410
Uh... yeah. I'm fine.

1091
01:04:04,047 --> 01:04:06,414
Now, why don't you go
back up to bed, hmm?

1092
01:04:06,416 --> 01:04:08,349
Okay.

1093
01:04:08,351 --> 01:04:11,117
I wish you could celebrate
with us tomorrow.

1094
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,421
We all get together and sing.

1095
01:04:13,423 --> 01:04:16,122
It's so beautiful that

1096
01:04:16,124 --> 01:04:19,359
if you close your eyes
and listen,

1097
01:04:19,361 --> 01:04:22,965
all of your sadness
just goes away.

1098
01:04:26,435 --> 01:04:29,135
That sounds nice.

1099
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:31,438
Huh?

1100
01:04:35,977 --> 01:04:38,278
Thank you, Santa.

1101
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,282
Good night.

1102
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:45,119
Good-good night.

1103
01:04:58,266 --> 01:05:01,969
I just met
the strangest little Who girl.

1104
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,508
All right, Max. Let's go.

1105
01:05:13,547 --> 01:05:17,315
<i>He tried to forget it,
but the words filled his head,</i>

1106
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:19,284
<i>and he found himself thinking</i>

1107
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:21,486
<i>about what the young girl
had said.</i>

1108
01:05:21,488 --> 01:05:23,488
<i>It was hard to imagine.</i>

1109
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,556
<i>Could it really be true?</i>

1110
01:05:25,558 --> 01:05:27,558
<i>But if they could all be happy,</i>

1111
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,261
<i>maybe he could be, too.</i>

1112
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:57,022
What?

1113
01:06:02,127 --> 01:06:04,328
<i>Her head felt unsteady,</i>

1114
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:06,296
<i>and her heart was just sick.</i>

1115
01:06:06,298 --> 01:06:09,266
- Oh, no.
- <i>It must be a joke</i>

1116
01:06:09,268 --> 01:06:11,901
<i>or a prank or a trick.</i>

1117
01:06:11,903 --> 01:06:14,604
<i>Who would do such a thing?</i>

1118
01:06:14,606 --> 01:06:18,007
<i>Who would stoop down this low?</i>

1119
01:06:18,009 --> 01:06:20,943
<i>And then one little girl
realized...</i>

1120
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:23,181
<i>she might just know.</i>

1121
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:29,352
<i>3,000 feet up,
up the side of Mount Crumpit,</i>

1122
01:06:29,354 --> 01:06:34,156
<i>the Grinch rode with his load
to the tip-top to dump it.</i>

1123
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:35,624
Keep going.

1124
01:06:35,626 --> 01:06:37,560
We're gonna make it.

1125
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,262
Oh, dear.
Wha... What happened?

1126
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:45,166
- Where's the decorations?
- All the presents. - Aw, man.

1127
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:48,436
Mom... it's my fault.

1128
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:50,538
What... What is?

1129
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,107
All of this.

1130
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:54,342
I-I trapped Santa last night,

1131
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:58,380
'cause I wanted to ask him to
do something special for you.

1132
01:06:58,382 --> 01:07:00,715
But I think I made him mad,

1133
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:04,085
and that's why he stole
everyone's Christmas.
