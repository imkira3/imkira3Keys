2
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Percy!

3
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,873
Look at him with his horse.

4
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,068
Wave to your father.

5
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,594
Gentlemen!

6
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,672
Today, I will be delivered
to the Archduke Ferdinand at the gala.

7
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,752
I expect you to behave
with distinction on this hunt.

8
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Good luck...

9
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,994
and Godspeed.

10
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,520
Could they not fit you a rocking chair
on that horse, grandad?

11
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,076
You'll all be my gun bearers by evening.

12
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,269
I've no doubt of that.

13
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,196
Keep up there! Keep up there!

14
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,350
Major, there's no path there!

15
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,515
Major! Major!

16
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Good boy.

17
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,229
You caught him?

18
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,359
Superb horsemanship, Major.

19
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,759
Excellent shot, sir.

20
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,115
These woods have been deadly to horses.

21
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,268
To Death;

22
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,598
the best source to Life.

23
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,559
You'll be the toast of the gala.

24
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,709
Here they come.

25
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,759
Oh, he's triumphant!

26
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,431
- Daddy did it!
- Come here, you.

27
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,709
- Daddy!
- Well done, Daddy.

28
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,674
Someday, you and I
will go hunting together.

29
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,632
We're going to be late.

30
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,154
Oh, God, it's this damn thing.

31
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,439
You must be so pleased
with yourselves. You, men.

32
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,516
Making us wear these awful things.

33
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,318
At least you're not wearing trousers.

34
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,188
Oh, I would if I could.

35
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
I know.

36
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Well?

37
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Rather lovely.

38
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
"Rather lovely."

39
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,118
What is it? What's amiss?

40
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,553
You've got the deer.

41
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,432
All eyes will be on you this evening.

42
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,357
Well, my darling, I will be the only man
there tonight, of my rank,

43
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,590
whose uniform is unadorned.

44
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,398
How can that matter now?

45
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,355
The great Secretary Bryce
will be at the gala.

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,716
Oh, Ms. Fawcett.

47
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,473
You've no medals.

48
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,234
"Oh, no, Mr. Bryce.
You see, I've been terribly busy

49
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,596
teaching ancient militiamen to
point their rifles at tree stumps, so...

50
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
No, no.

51
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,232
No medals for me, sir."

52
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Tell me.

53
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,556
Who's this Secretary Bryce
when he's at home?

54
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,356
The last man here upon whom we might
possibly rely for advancement.

55
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
I see.

56
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,478
I'm getting older, cheeky,

57
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,439
and very impatient of lost years.

58
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,478
I know the medals are ridiculous. I do.

59
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,157
But this may be our final chance.

60
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,776
Secretary Bryce,
this is Major Fawcett.

61
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,392
- Major.
- It's an honor, sir.

62
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Honor's mine, sir.

63
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,151
Good to meet you. Meet Secretary Bryce;
Secretary Bryce, Madame Bellamy.

64
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,035
Major and Mrs. Percy Fawcett.

65
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,080
They're toasting
the kill without you.

66
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,674
...this most magnificent animal...

67
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,272
Well, I am dancing with you,
so I've got the better of the bargain.

68
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,158
May I, Major?

69
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Spoken too soon.

70
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Come.

71
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,832
By the way, who got the kill?

72
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,632
Oh, that would be
Major Fawcett, Mr. Secretary.

73
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,917
Well, we should invite him to supper.

74
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Oh..

75
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,038
Well, may I say...

76
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,796
he's been rather unfortunate
in his choice of ancestors.

77
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
I see.

78
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Well, then...

79
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,508
Tell me. How is Lady...

80
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,471
No more than 20 cases, Clive.

81
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,999
Hurry along, men. Come on!

82
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,296
Come on. Put your back into it.

83
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,231
- Fawcett!
- Put your backs into it.

84
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,995
Hurry it along.

85
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,550
- Sir.
- You're off to London tomorrow,

86
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,949
to the Royal Geographical Society.

87
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,319
The Royal Geographical, sir?

88
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,951
There's a major exploration afoot.

89
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,038
Sounds like a grand adventure.

90
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Thank you, sir.

91
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Thank you.

92
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,748
Major Fawcett, sir.

93
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,836
Oh, yes, yes. Come in.

94
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,879
Absent George Goldie,
president of the RGS,

95
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,318
this is Mr. John Scott Keltie,
our secretary.

96
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,549
How do you do, Major?

97
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
How do you do, sir?

98
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,069
Our paths have not crossed

99
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,879
during our work here
several years back, did they?

100
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
They did not, sir.

101
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,634
I was likely consumed
with my studies at the time.

102
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,275
Of course.

103
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,271
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

104
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,439
Ah! The army seems to have
posted you in many places in the path.

105
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,789
Yes, I've served in Salon
and in Hong Kong before that;

106
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,992
most recently in lreland.

107
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,310
As you can see, I've been transferred
a fair bit around the Empire.

108
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,716
Major, what do you know about Bolivia?

109
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,636
- In South America, sir?
- That's right.

110
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Only what I've read.

111
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,556
Hmm. Then you can't know very much.

112
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,117
This is as good a map
of Bolivia as we have.

113
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,431
Map's a bit blank as you can see.
Nothing's really known about it at all.

114
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,159
A land of primitives.

115
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,356
But there are rubber plantations
all over Amazonia.

116
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,355
Very profitable.

117
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,834
There is now considerable argument
between Bolivia and Brazil

118
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,876
as to what constitutes their border.

119
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,238
So fantastically high
is the price of rubber,

120
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,670
that war could arise.

121
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Do you follow?

122
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,828
- I do, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,274
Although, I'm not sure what this
has to do with me.

124
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,958
I'm getting to that.

125
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,997
Neither country will accept
mapping done by the other,

126
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,437
so they've requested us to act as referee.

127
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,918
- Mm.
- As you've completed your mapping here...

128
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,993
with distinction.
You came under our consideration.

129
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,275
- I see.
- Mm-hmm.

130
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,153
Sirs, may I speak candidly?

131
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Please.

132
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,270
My survey work was long ago.

133
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,797
And to be quite honest,
I was rather hoping for a position

134
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,677
where I might see a fair bit of action.

135
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Major.

136
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,192
This is far more than just survey work!

137
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,594
This is exploration in the jungle.

138
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,118
The environment's brutally difficult.

139
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,639
Terrible disease.

140
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,228
Murderous savages.

141
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,436
The journey may well mean your life.

142
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,793
At the very least,
you will be gone for several years.

143
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,990
But were you to succeed,
such an undertaking

144
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,640
could earn you soldierly decoration.

145
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
And...

146
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,190
even reclaim your family name.

147
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,276
You know we knew your father.

148
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Did you?

149
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Yes.

150
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
I did not.

151
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Terrible thing.

152
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,079
Man's love of drink and gaming.

153
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,637
But as I say, success in this venture
could change your lot...

154
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,435
considerably.

155
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,788
How come I've never seen
a plain change color?

156
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Like that.

157
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,429
Does it look big, like a big brain?

158
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
It looks round.

159
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,235
- It looks round in that doesn't it?
- It does.

160
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,639
Jack, will you go and play?

161
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,352
I want to talk to
your father for a minute.

162
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,238
Do you want to pick me a flower?

163
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,198
Uh... Ooh...

164
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,556
- Shall I throw the ball for her?
- Yeah.

165
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Ready?

166
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,110
Steady.

167
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Throw it that way.

168
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Throw it that far!

169
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,714
Oh, I knew it!

170
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,673
Hey, it's all wet.

171
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,593
He'll not know you when you return.

172
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,152
But you must go. I know that.

173
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,072
Indeed.

174
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,268
I have something to tell you.

175
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,796
I think I'm going to have another child.

176
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,679
I know I'm having another child.

177
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
Don't be sad.

178
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,399
I'm an independent woman.

179
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,834
I hadn't noticed.

180
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,549
Cheeky... Darling...

181
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,669
I know this is a sacrifice for all of us.

182
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,674
But it will be worth it.

183
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,475
I have no doubt.

184
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,028
Come here.

185
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,113
Cut you bloody throat!

186
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,789
...you're a dead man!

187
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Who are you?

188
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,789
What do you want?

189
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,475
Henry Costin.

190
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,277
I replied to your ad eleven times.

191
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,235
I'm your aide-de-camp.

192
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Mr. Costin?

193
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,635
What are my duties, sir?

194
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,793
We've been at sea a week.
Why are you just presenting yourself now?

195
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,674
I wanted to make sure
you were up to the task, sir.

196
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,713
Are you drunk, Mr. Costin?

197
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
No.

198
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,068
You could've fooled me.

199
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
Well...

200
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,475
Well...

201
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,788
I might have had a little.

202
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
I've got a...

203
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
letter of commendation.

204
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,192
They say I'm both skilled
at rifle and pistols...

205
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
and for bravery.

206
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
That's very impressive.

207
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
You have a family?

208
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,909
No, none at all.

209
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,395
I see; so nothing to shed.

210
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,869
I take it you do then.

211
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,238
Mr. Costin, I would like to be clear.

212
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,199
My reputation as a man
rests entirely on our success.

213
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,152
I think you shall find me
capable of every sacrifice.

214
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,751
Therefore, I must insist.

215
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,268
Oh! Right you are, sir.

216
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,031
We'll need all the fortitude you've got.

217
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Understood.

218
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,471
We are explorers now.

219
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,919
I just received a cable.

220
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,832
We have new orders to map the Verde River,

221
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,717
- Please!
- find its source.

222
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,516
It forms a critical part of the border
between Bolivia and Brazil.

223
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,719
Our survey route is to begin
at a place called Fazenda Jacobina,

224
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,671
which does not appear to be on this map.

225
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,395
I know Facenda Jacobina.

226
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,872
It's an old rubber town.

227
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,320
It's meant to be quite enchanting.

228
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,710
Really?

229
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,075
You may not be
completely useless after all.

230
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,352
Time is of the essence now.

231
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,155
War's at stake.

232
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,677
So you, and I, and a couple of mules

233
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,875
are gonna stop a war?

234
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,393
Well then you and I...

235
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,591
are going to have to
depend on each other.

236
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,596
Neither of us will survive this alone.

237
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Right you are.

238
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,715
What's that you're reading?

239
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,828
Poem, from my wife, by Kipling.

240
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,994
It's called "The Explorer."

241
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,874
And what?

242
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,229
Would you like to hear it?

243
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,913
It'll be a long way
until we reach Amazonia.

244
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Be my guest.

245
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,629
"'There's no sense in going further;
it's the edge of cultivation, '

246
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,589
So they said, and I believed it;

247
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,230
broke my land and sowed my crop;

248
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,190
Built my barns and strung my fences..."

249
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,958
"...in the little border station

250
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,311
Tucked away below the foothills
where the trails run out and stop.

251
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,599
Till a voice, as bad as Conscience,
rang interminable changes

252
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,639
On one everlasting Whisper
day and night repeated; so:

253
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,515
'Something hidden.

254
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Go and find it.

255
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,271
Go and look behind the Ranges;

256
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,829
Something lost behind the Ranges.

257
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,599
Lost and waiting for you.

258
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Go!"'

259
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,589
Twenty-nine degrees.

260
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,430
Sixteen minutes south of the equator.

261
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Twenty-nine.

262
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Sixt...

263
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,795
Sixteen.

264
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,558
Rather deadly looking snake here.

265
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,349
We might be a little bit
too English for this jungle.

266
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,598
Strangers in a strange land.

267
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Major Fawcett.

268
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Is that you?

269
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,996
- Yes.
- Welcome to Fazenda Jacobina.

270
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,416
Lance Corporal Manley, sir,
liaison to the government of Japanese...

271
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,839
You start on ceremony.

272
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,439
A simple handshake will suffice.

273
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,875
This is Mr. Costin.

274
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,317
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

275
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,759
but I have received a telegram
from the border commission.

276
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Go on.

277
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,673
They strongly advise you to...

278
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,715
abort the mission.

279
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,279
It's become far too dangerous.

280
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,280
- They've already fired...
- Where are the government offices?

281
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Sir...

282
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Government, sir?

283
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,794
I'm afraid you left government behind
a long time ago.

284
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,115
In that case, you'd better
send them a telegram.

285
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,153
Informing them that
we will not stand down,

286
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,390
and we shall proceed as planned.

287
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,796
How quickly can you
find us an lndian guide?

288
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Well, I...

289
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,592
I had an lndian guide sir, but...

290
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,869
But what happened to him?

291
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,116
What? Was he afraid of a little hard work?

292
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Not quite, sir.

293
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,874
It's out of my hands now.

294
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,029
You need to speak to Baron De Gondoriz.
He runs the rubber company here.

295
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,229
Good evening, Baron.
Thank you for seeing us.

296
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,158
We are from the British Army.

297
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,236
We're to be venturing up the Rio Verde,

298
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,030
and find ourselves in need
of some of your men.

299
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,913
In exchange, I promise very favorable
treatment from my country.

300
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,473
Keep him chained up.
He can't be trusted.

301
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,509
He needs a good beatin'
every now and again.

302
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,148
Por favor.

303
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,353
You goin' up river, are you?

304
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Yes.

305
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
We're surveying.

306
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Well...

307
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,556
Ain't nobody comes back from up there.

308
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Ever.

309
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,798
Is this slave good enough for you?

310
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
Yes.

311
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,680
Do you speak English?

312
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,875
He understands.

313
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
We taught him.

314
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,990
What will you take for him?
And any four men of his choosing?

315
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,675
It offends you to negotiate with me.

316
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,560
- No, not at all.
- Please.

317
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,114
Do not embarrass yourself.

318
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,352
You come here to make maps.

319
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Why is that?

320
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,951
So that there may be peace.

321
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,309
What is peace?

322
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,591
Peace means my business would flourish.

323
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,355
I would flourish.

324
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
Peace...

325
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,432
means only that nothing will change.

326
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,515
I will help you.

327
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,990
Because you will make sure
that nothing will change.

328
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,440
I forgot to give you this, Major.

329
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,000
It came directly here
while you were surveying.

330
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,392
Can you show me how far the river goes?

331
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Muy bien.

332
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,034
We've three full rafts,
four horses.

333
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,837
This our party?
Bloody desperate lot you've got us.

334
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,518
They're as dependable as any
that can be found here, Mr. Costin.

335
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,198
We're the only ones who will pay them.

336
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,279
Lot will do twelve hours a day; no less.

337
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,469
The river will be our home
for the next two years.

338
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
We shall not fail.

339
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,516
Mankind awaits our discoveries.

340
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,831
Have you ever seen a land
Like old El Dorado

341
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,589
Of gold and of silver,
Of gold and of silver

342
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,389
Have you ever seen a land
Like old El Dorado

343
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,359
Of gold and of silver,
And silver and gold

344
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,754
I can see the fish,

345
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,999
but I can't catch them.

346
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
Nothing again.

347
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
I don't understand.

348
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,950
The river is deep here.
There is plenty of fish.

349
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,435
It's a desert.

350
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,069
A green desert.

351
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
All right, pull it in.

352
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,309
Try again further up.

353
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,080
Major Fawcett.

354
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,593
What on earth is she doing
all the way out here?

355
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,072
She's come to load rubber, no doubt.

356
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,400
Or maybe she's looking
for the gold at El Dorado.

357
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,360
It's German.

358
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,908
The trunk says "Hamburg."

359
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Someone aboard.

360
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
Hey!

361
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Are you German?

362
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,118
Cosin! The water!

363
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Get out of the water!

364
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,276
Where's Fawcett? Fawcett!

365
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
It's nothing.

366
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,389
Are we close?

367
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,196
Even the lndian's gone mad now.

368
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,153
He was talking to me
about gold cities today.

369
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,359
Like a little child.

370
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,711
He thinks we are conquistadors
to be led to our death.

371
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,630
Well, the lndian seemed
a bit mad to begin with.

372
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,230
I'd like you to read this
to me if you can.

373
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,199
If we are to meet our end here,
what difference does it make?

374
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,758
Afraid it would be quite unbearable,
for me to read it myself.

375
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,033
Feel free to summarize.

376
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,395
Right you are, sir.

377
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,030
Your wife has moved the family to Devon.

378
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,273
She's given birth to a boy named Brian.

379
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,718
Your oldest boy, Jack,
is excelling in all ways, she says.

380
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,757
I see my son's face
in my dreams now.

381
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,350
What kind of fool am I,
to leave my family for this place?

382
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,551
What did you hope to achieve out here?

383
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
I don't know.

384
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,471
All we have left now is to get
to the source of the river.

385
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Mr. Costin.

386
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Major.

387
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
Food gone.

388
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,916
Jesus Christ, we are going
die from hungry.

389
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
One piece.

390
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Give me that!

391
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,113
Control yourselves!

392
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,118
We are not savages.

393
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,111
We're leaving our bones here, Major.

394
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
And for what?

395
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
A map?

396
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,909
Are you gonna forget that
we're not making it back without any food?

397
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,920
Have you ever thought about that?

398
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,269
Well, we're here starving to death.

399
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,233
We're not even looking for gold.

400
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,240
Let's have at it then.

401
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,032
Ah! My ear!

402
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
My ear!

403
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,079
- My ear!
- Next one'll be up your ass.

404
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,830
Thank you, Mr. Costin.

405
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,514
Woo!

406
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,557
No one's ever been here before me!

407
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,593
No one! Ever!

408
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
We made it!

409
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,120
Woo!

410
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,118
The first! We're the first!

411
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Woo!

412
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
Major.

413
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,754
Major, we've lost the lndian.

414
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
He's run off.

415
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,829
He got us here.

416
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
My last reading.

417
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,992
- Am I dreaming this?
- No. I see it too.

418
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Please.

419
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,679
It's our only chance.

420
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,755
Must have.

421
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
Thank God.

422
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,271
Couldn't have done that
better myself, sir.

423
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
What is it, chief?

424
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,440
It's pottery.

425
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
From the ground.

426
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,029
Look it's all over.

427
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,960
Look at this.

428
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
They're ancient.

429
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,113
Christ. He was right.

430
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,073
The lndian was right.

431
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,752
When he said no one had been here before.

432
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,911
I think he meant no white man, Mr. Costin.
I think he meant no white man.

433
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,273
We thought the lndian mad.

434
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,993
There must've been dwellings here.

435
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,395
Thank God that boar's
more meat on it than we do.

436
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,960
All right, easy, easy, easy.

437
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,079
The exit from hell
is always difficult, Mr. Costin.

438
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,799
But we will get back.

439
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,509
The world will know what we've found here.

440
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,440
We have to keep going!

441
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,399
Thank you. Thank you.

442
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,233
Major Fawcett, you are
England's bravest explorer.

443
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,560
Thank you, sir.

444
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,840
Your son.

445
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,514
This must be Brian.

446
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,920
And here's Jack.

447
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,949
Are you my father?

448
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,114
I am, indeed, son.

449
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,358
Come. Give me a hug.

450
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,155
Let's go home.

451
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,320
Thank you all.

452
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,556
Percy, come. Meet our host,
Mr. James Murray.

453
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,392
He's very anxious to meet you.

454
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,797
A person of considerable resources.

455
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,312
He certainly has a beautiful home.

456
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,756
With, of course,
a reputation to match.

457
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,355
Ah, Mr. Murray.

458
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,830
Major Fawcett, I see you down there.

459
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,750
Welcome... to the inner circle.

460
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,194
Thank, Mr. Murray.

461
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,111
- Mrs. Fawcett.
- Good evening.

462
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:13,316
Percy, they're all so excited
to hear your speech to the RGS.

463
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,229
Listen to them, will you?

464
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,471
They're all talking about your mission.

465
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Extraordinary.

466
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,153
I'm just honored to be here, sir.

467
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,515
I read your article
in The Times this morning

468
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,752
about the slave trade
in the Americas. It's uh...

469
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,628
You're an enlightened man.

470
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,629
Poor savages.

471
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,273
Native does deserve our sympathy.

472
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,760
Yes.

473
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,270
I think we have only
just scratched the surface of Amazonia.

474
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,948
Most certainly.

475
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,594
I was, um...

476
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:56,593
Well, I'm a biologist, but I'm also
somewhat of an explorer.

477
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,275
I was second in command under
Shackleton in the Antarctica.

478
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,749
Did you know that?

479
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,513
I don't think there's anyone here
who's not well aware

480
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,238
of your accomplishments, Mr. Murray.

481
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,360
Here, here.

482
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,594
You have distinguished
yourself with great bravery.

483
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,957
I know what these expeditions require.

484
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,670
Well, it's been my lifelong ambition to...

485
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,433
go to the Amazon, you know?

486
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,232
I must say, I hope that the RGS
continues its pursuits,

487
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
but I...

488
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,312
I have come to believe that mapmaking
should be a secondary interest.

489
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,840
Really?

490
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,630
I witnessed several
archaeological discoveries

491
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,119
that I believe may have
enormous significance.

492
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,238
- Such as?
- Pottery in the jungle.

493
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,598
Where no white man
has ever been before.

494
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,557
My friend, a word in your ear, please.

495
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,872
Your exploits have opened
every door for you.

496
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,313
I would suggest keeping
such findings to yourself.

497
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,400
Mm-hmm.

498
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,717
It is one thing to defend
the primitive jungle men.

499
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,509
It is quite another to elevate
their capacity beyond reason.

500
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,116
I mean, no one here would dispute
that you believed what you saw, but...

501
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,997
such a trip is very hard on the mind;

502
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,154
very hard, indeed.

503
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
Mr. Keltie.

504
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,713
I think you should find
my mind perfectly fit.

505
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,912
And still open, thank heavens.

506
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,559
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Good afternoon.

507
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,312
I would like to introduce
one of our brothers

508
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,072
whose achievements are now known to you

509
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,037
and not inconsiderable.

510
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,230
Major Percy Fawcett.

511
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
Thank you, sir.

512
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,711
By rights, I should be with my husband.

513
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,550
It's men only I'm afraid, madam.

514
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,879
My esteemed colleagues,

515
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,791
it is now my firm belief

516
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,033
that Amazonia is far more
than the green desert

517
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,792
which many of us had supposed.

518
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,031
I am proposing that Amazonia...

519
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,759
contain a hidden civilization

520
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,399
One that may well
predate our own.

521
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,669
Major Fawcett!

522
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,038
I am Mr. William Barkley of Bedford,

523
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,917
and I have been to South America.

524
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,556
Please, Mr. Barkley, I'm sure we'd all
be thrilled to hear about your holiday.

525
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,472
But we are currently
discussing exploration.

526
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,120
Now to be clear.

527
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,589
Are you insisting on
mythical kingdoms of gold?

528
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,319
Now, those fantasies

529
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,551
lured the conquistadors
to their destruction.

530
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,836
Sir, it was the conquistadors and we

531
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,396
who have been destroying Amazonia.

532
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,036
I have seen, with my own eyes,

533
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,953
evidence of their civilization.

534
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,918
And I assure you, sir, it is real.

535
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,513
Perhaps it is too difficult
for some of you to admit.

536
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:48,509
We, who have been steeped
in the bigotry of the church for so long,

537
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,115
cannot give much credence
to an older civilization.

538
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,999
Particularly one created
by a race the white man

539
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,640
has so brutally condemned
to slavery and death.

540
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,760
Are you insisting that these savages,
they're our equals?

541
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,034
I do not know, Mr. Barkley,
but I intend to find out.

542
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,873
What?! Savages
in Westminster Abbey?

543
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,316
Hence, your disrespect, sir!

544
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,753
But what is at stake?

545
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,355
If we may find a city...

546
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,238
where one was considered
impossible to exist...

547
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,351
It may well write a whole
new chapter in human history.

548
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,156
Yes! Yes!

549
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,071
Consider my evidence.

550
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,390
I have archaeological finds.

551
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,835
Antiquities as sophisticated as
any in Asia or Europe...

552
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,270
in the middle of the jungle!

553
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,157
Pots and pans!

554
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,073
Pots and pans!

555
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,669
Pots and pans!

556
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,272
Pans! Pots and pans!

557
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,955
Pots and pans!

558
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,713
- Settle down, children! Settle down!
- Ooh...

559
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:22,276
After my return from the jungle,
I have examined a single document;

560
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,393
dating from the conquistadors, Mr Barkley!

561
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,476
It states explicitly

562
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,795
the discovery of a lost city.

563
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:39,154
Uncovered in Trinity College, Dublin,
this week by my lovely wife.

564
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:46,394
W ritten by a Portuguese soldier
in 1753, and I quote,

565
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:52,470
"We came upon the ruins of
an ancient city bedecked with gold.

566
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,595
Roads...

567
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,200
Temples...

568
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,908
Ancient symbols...

569
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,230
What? El Dorado?

570
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,673
No, gentlemen!

571
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,356
- I call it "Zed."
- Zed?

572
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,477
The ultimate piece of the human puzzle!

573
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,835
It is there and we must find it!

574
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,633
Mr. Fawcett!

575
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,869
Mr. Fawcett, I say we return!

576
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,793
I say we go and find the glory!

577
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,509
What say you?

578
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,632
What I say, Mr. Murray...

579
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,837
is I accept that challenge!

580
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,268
Mr. Costin!

581
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,353
I see you seated there.

582
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,878
Will you return with us?

583
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,080
Mr. Fawcett.

584
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,074
That jungle is hell, but...

585
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,794
one kind of likes it.

586
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,718
We shall return!

587
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,711
And we shall find the glory!

588
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,598
I have such high hopes, Cheeky.

589
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,320
With this journey, we may be able

590
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,188
to tear down their
narrowminded convictions.

591
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,753
I do believe I am quite ready
to accompany on your next journey.

592
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,880
What do you mean?

593
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,870
The children will be
back in school by then.

594
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,792
And I have learned to read the stars...

595
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,515
and navigate.

596
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,473
I've become very well versed
in the history of the region.

597
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,991
After all, it is I who found the document.

598
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,629
I know, darling.

599
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,558
But that would be impossible.

600
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,076
It's not a place at all for a woman.

601
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,599
"Not a place for a woman"?

602
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,400
Yes.

603
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,879
We believe firmly
in the equality between us.

604
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,952
In equality, yes,
but in mind, not in body.

605
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,040
Ah.

606
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,195
The rigor of such a trip would be
beyond your imagination.

607
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,680
I believe it is generally acknowledged
that the pain a woman experiences

608
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,399
during childbirth far exceeds
anything a man must endure.

609
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,960
- This is not about childbirth.
- Oh, what would you know of childbirth?

610
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,519
Have you witnessed two minutes of it,
let alone endured it?

611
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,120
The jungle...

612
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,958
is about years of practice...

613
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,954
training, the art of soldiering.

614
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,480
I have that.

615
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,235
It is about maggots in your skin.
It is about deadly snakes

616
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,073
and disease that make you vomit blood.

617
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,478
You could not bear it.

618
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,476
And I could not bear that either.

619
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,599
Somehow I managed to bear the dangers
you faced the years you were gone.

620
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,990
This way me might be together
for some of our lives!

621
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,195
You are my wife!

622
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,435
I need you here.

623
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,589
Oh, God.

624
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,353
Not as a tentmate
in need of constant care.

625
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,192
And in this fantasy of yours,
what happens to the children?

626
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,955
Please, try to be reasonable.

627
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,114
You will throw reasonable in my face.

628
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,912
Was it reasonable to stay here
and struggle to provide

629
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,840
for the children while you
wandered the jungle?

630
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,308
No. You have given no thought,

631
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,039
not on thought, to my
aspirations as a woman.

632
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,016
Have you thought about that?

633
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:54,114
Men and women have performed
their roles since the beginning of time!

634
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,672
It is the cornerstone
of our civilization.

635
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,069
I must say, I did expect more
understanding from you,

636
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,309
and I am disgraced

637
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,840
- by your ignorant posture!
- Mother!

638
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,630
It's all right, darling.

639
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,176
I'm sorry we were shouting.

640
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,440
- Run along I'll come in...
- Mother, please don't fight!

641
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,674
It's all right, Jack. Go.

642
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,070
121 miles
to Oviedo's last marking.

643
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,760
You should put some grease on that.

644
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,440
Will do.

645
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,549
Where's Mr. Murray?

646
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,833
He's bringing up the rear, chief.

647
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,160
Mr. Murray!

648
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,958
Yes?

649
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,155
How are you managing?

650
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,155
I am managing well, thank you.

651
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,750
My pack is just a little heavy it seems,

652
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,234
Perhaps I shall...

653
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,755
rid myself of the unnecessary
accoutrements, yes?

654
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,358
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

655
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,708
You don't want to be ill-equipped
for the journey ahead.

656
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,800
Well, yes.

657
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,400
However...

658
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,754
an awful lot of this...

659
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,359
scientific equipment seems
to be slowing us down.

660
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,228
When we reach the river then,

661
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,716
but you must keep one
spare set of clothing.

662
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,754
And, of course, your mattress.

663
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,829
I believe I shall go
naked as Adam in this...

664
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,320
infernal heat.

665
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,029
What a site that would be.

666
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,120
Let's keep going.

667
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,276
That bugger wishes he was
back on the South Pole.

668
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,315
He'll pull his weight soon enough.
Don't worry.

669
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,681
Should we treat ourselves
to the mail, gentlemen?

670
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,678
We've still got the sack
from San Carlos.

671
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,872
You've got two from
your wife and son, Major.

672
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,112
There's been a major discovery in Peru.

673
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,913
Oh, and an American,

674
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:32,230
Hiram Bingham, he's found the lost city
in the lndies, Machu Picchu.

675
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,795
He says that Dr. Hamilton Rice
is hot on his trail.

676
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,717
Seems we're in a race
with the Americans now.

677
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,160
They're after a bit of our prestige.

678
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,514
It's too far north.

679
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,600
Mm.

680
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,873
Still... Proves there's much to be found.

681
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,908
We've lost the other boat.

682
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,200
Savages!

683
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,551
- Arm yourselves!
- No! Hold your fire.

684
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,229
Everyone out of the boat.

685
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,675
Take cover!

686
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,920
Mr. Manley!

687
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,879
Get your concertina.

688
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,960
My concertina, sir?

689
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,876
Yes, do it now!

690
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,598
Play "Soldiers of the Queen"!

691
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,360
Come on!

692
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,272
Mr. Costin, come and sing with me.

693
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,080
Come!

694
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,960
Are you ready?

695
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:47,920
And!

696
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:53,752
We're soldiers of the Queen, my lads

697
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,593
Who've been my lads,

698
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,433
Who've seen my lads

699
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,275
In the fight for England's glory, lads

700
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,831
The England's soldiers of the Queen!

701
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,119
- Amigos.
- Hola.

702
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,553
Mano, mano, mano.

703
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,470
Amigos!

704
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,348
Mano, mano, mano!

705
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,600
Amigo!

706
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,360
Amigo!

707
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Amigo!

708
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,552
Boys! Point!

709
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,148
If the red man attacks.

710
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,679
You rally to me at all costs.

711
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,109
Rally to me at all costs.

712
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,911
Oh, good God.

713
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,280
We are safe.

714
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,595
The chief has invited us to be his guests.

715
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,200
You all right?

716
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,280
This is a tribe of cannibals.

717
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,314
I know. I know.

718
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:44,390
The chief explained it's
a dead member of their tribe.

719
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,238
His spirit will enter them if they eat it.

720
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,636
We must attempt to engage.

721
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,518
They may have critical information
about our destination.

722
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,108
I... I refuse this madness.

723
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,920
I refuse it.

724
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,393
Men, come with me... Come.

725
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,397
Boys, we have to get back to that boat.

726
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,280
Costin.

727
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,360
Sí.

728
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,960
Gracias.

729
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,474
He's heard rumors of a city,
but he's not sure.

730
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,636
He said further up the river he thinks
there will be people who can help us.

731
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,760
All right, then.

732
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:25,960
Gracias, amigo.

733
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,631
- Comida?
- Food?

734
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,280
Comida?

735
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,151
- Uh...
- Comida. Sí, gracias.

736
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,600
To you.

737
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,113
That is remarkable.

738
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,348
That substance
only stuns the fish.

739
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,640
They don't kill more than
what they have to.

740
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:27,749
Remarkable.

741
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:57,471
These so-called savages
have cultivated the jungle.

742
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,037
Where no one thought it could be done.

743
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,069
We've been so...
arrogant and contemptuous.

744
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,473
I no less than others.

745
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,558
Look how it's all laid out.

746
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,871
It's mathematical in its precision.

747
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,800
Well, it's what you've been saying.

748
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,392
Imagine what Z must be like.

749
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,638
Well, the canoe's useless now.

750
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,514
We'll have to use the raft.

751
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,189
We leave at sunrise.

752
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,160
Chief.

753
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,240
Chief!

754
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,240
Think I found him.

755
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,840
Hello, old sport.

756
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,790
I appear to have gotten myself lost.

757
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,799
Thank God you're all alive.
I had assumed that you'd been

758
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,633
cannibalized by those savages.

759
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,268
Look at my leg. I have a nasty wound.

760
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,351
You'll be looked after. Come.

761
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,910
- No.
- We must keep moving.

762
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,588
I think I have a bit of a fever coming on.

763
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,870
Manley, help me clean all of this up.

764
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,034
This was in my bag.

765
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:37,832
It was a gift from my wife and children
for all of us to share.

766
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,073
I know. I was just very...

767
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,800
hungry.

768
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,437
I'm a little bit dead. If you don't mind
I'm going to rest for a little...

769
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,440
while longer.

770
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,196
You have no right to be tired.

771
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:01,550
My own children, at their tender ages,
could be counted on more than you.

772
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,428
And I could be home... with them.

773
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,351
And yet, I am here with you

774
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,951
to attempt great things.

775
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,548
Have you water please?

776
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,517
You'll get water when we get to the raft.

777
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,353
Mr. Manley, help me get him on his feet.

778
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,633
Stay where you are, Mr. Murray.

779
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,232
It's essential we keep the balance.

780
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,229
Murray!

781
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,955
Stay down!

782
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,151
Stay down, God damn you!

783
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,913
Murray, stay low to the ground!

784
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,560
Swim to shore!

785
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,393
We'll bank further down!

786
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,475
Swim to shore!

787
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,708
Let go! Swim to shore!

788
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,319
- Let go!
- No!

789
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,234
You're tipping the raft!
We're losing supplies! God damn you!

790
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,478
I said let go, you pigheaded weakling!

791
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,560
Let go!

792
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,559
Mr. Manley, help me!

793
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,232
Help me get to shore!

794
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,235
- Shut up.
- Chief!

795
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,635
We've lost a third of our rations.

796
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,553
- I was drowning!
- There was no chance of that!

797
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,350
And this after you stole our food!

798
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,555
I suppose I should have starved myself.

799
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,480
That would have been the honorable
course of action, wouldn't it?

800
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,036
Isn't that what you want?
You want me to die.

801
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,394
I... Please slow down.

802
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,870
Give a dying man a chance.

803
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,639
I just want to be dead.

804
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:18,557
...young upstart and his
vulgar quest for glory.

805
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,311
Like a Judas...

806
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,278
he has delivered me...

807
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,280
into this...

808
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,360
jungle.

809
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,353
Well, we're two weeks behind...

810
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,231
according to the sextant and the charts.

811
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,440
Chief.

812
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,870
This leg wound of his
is becoming more infected.

813
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,158
Mr. Murray's got blood poisoning now.

814
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,989
I noticed.

815
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,560
You think he'll make it?

816
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,880
Slim chance.

817
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,397
He is not worth kissing...

818
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,998
the hem of your garment.

819
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,200
As I...

820
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,718
am not worthy of yours.

821
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,356
Give me strength to survive.

822
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,593
He is not worthy.

823
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,192
No. No.

824
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:46,789
Yes? What is it?

825
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,319
There are mining encampments
south of us on the river.

826
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,871
In the morning, you'll be
on your way to them.

827
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,918
I'm going to give you our last horse

828
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,718
with what supplies I can spare
and an lndian to guide you.

829
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,359
I have a family at home.

830
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,197
I cannot allow you to jeopardize
the welfare of the entire crew.

831
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,870
You don't give a wit about me.

832
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,311
Or about any of the party.

833
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,475
You don't even care about going home.

834
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,429
You only care...

835
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,068
about your lost...

836
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,560
city.

837
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,471
I'm going to see
if there's a path through!

838
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,520
Chief!

839
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:42,960
Chief!

840
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,080
Chief!

841
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:58,960
I saw it!

842
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,193
We're getting close!

843
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,709
Keep going!

844
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,994
We need to go back.

845
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,320
Guy's a bloody bastard!
Cost us our last horse!

846
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,393
And this is how he repays us.

847
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,237
Rations ruined!
Murray's covered them in oil!

848
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,320
Look at it!

849
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,154
We must turn back.

850
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,517
There is no turning back.

851
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,239
We are right here!

852
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,435
We've nothing to show for our efforts.

853
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,120
- No evidence...
- What do we go on with?

854
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,112
With what we have on our backs,
we'll last a week at most!

855
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,075
It's over, Percy!

856
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,751
To be sent to the RGS:

857
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:38,079
Mr. James Murray was forced
to separate from our expedition

858
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,118
to seek medical attention.

859
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,158
His location is currently unknown,

860
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,677
and he has most likely perished.

861
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:55,113
The rest of the group
shall arrive back in England

862
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,433
as soon as is possible.

863
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,559
It looks like a war with France.

864
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,400
Better all get home or
we'll miss our chance to fight.

865
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,713
Please send that immediately.

866
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:18,800
Yes, sir.

867
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,993
Chase it. Go on! Go on, Bri.

868
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,276
That is Joan,
as you might have guessed.

869
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,475
Oh, Jack!

870
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:31,830
Your daughter.

871
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,480
Sorry! I didn't mean to do that.

872
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,148
Beautiful child.

873
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,749
Hello, Joan.

874
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,072
- I'll fetch the boys.
- No.

875
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,909
Let them finish.

876
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,792
When they're done, send them in.

877
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,791
It should be I who tells them
what has happened.

878
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,280
You're real.

879
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,590
Three, two, one... Go!

880
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,999
How much they've grown.

881
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,717
You've done beautifully with them.

882
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:45,680
My ball!

883
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:48,880
Hey, come on!

884
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,994
Gentlemen, welcome to our new home.

885
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,351
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.

886
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,352
Mr. John. Gentlemen.

887
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,433
Please, will you step this way?

888
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,120
- Congratulations on your knighthood.
- Ah, thank you.

889
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,991
I think that you know everybody here.

890
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:26,272
Mr. James Murray arrived
in London just this morning.

891
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:30,996
We felt it critical to assemble
as soon as possible.

892
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,751
Congratulations on your safe return.

893
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,959
It's a remarkable effort.

894
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,679
Mr. Murray contends
that you abandoned him.

895
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,429
Is this correct?

896
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,159
No. It is not.

897
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,830
He was given money and food.

898
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,834
It was an unfortunate but necessary
maneuver in order to save lives.

899
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,069
Sir George.

900
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,275
We spent all our time.

901
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,312
Playing around in the mud
with the savages.

902
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,713
I never saw any evidence of a lost city.

903
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:19,791
You were the reason we did not reach
our destination, Mr. Murray.

904
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,636
You poured paraffin on all our supplies.

905
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,996
I reject that accusation, Sir John.

906
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:29,158
I cannot tolerate any further insult
from this young man.

907
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:33,279
I... have retained counsel
and I will proceed accordingly.

908
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,919
And as for his lackeys,

909
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,152
they are swine and not to be trusted.

910
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,358
You should've been beaten in the jungle
like the dog that you are.

911
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,640
Please gentlemen.

912
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,712
Our nation is now at war.

913
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:51,518
It ill becomes us to indulge
personal conflicts.

914
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,672
I earnestly beseech you
to come to an understanding.

915
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,800
Very well.

916
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,711
I most generously offer that...

917
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,315
If you are willing
to apologize to me here

918
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,915
in front of this entire society,

919
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:17,188
I will consider withdrawing my claims
against the RGS and yourself,

920
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,916
with certain conditions, of course.

921
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,440
Well, Major.

922
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,748
Will you apologize?

923
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,878
For the general good...

924
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,271
I am prepared to reconcile.

925
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:34,800
Thank you.

926
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,308
I will, of course, need to hear
Mr. Murray's conditions.

927
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:44,359
On the day that I agreed
to join you on your mission

928
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,640
and allowed your star to enter my sphere,

929
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,758
your wife was present
to witness your ascent.

930
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:56,189
My only condition is that
she again be present

931
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,631
to witness your acknowledgement

932
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,440
of the wrongs...

933
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,074
that you have done to me.

934
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,400
Sir.

935
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,715
Mr. Murray.

936
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:15,754
The last time I saw you, I was putting you
on the only remaining horse,

937
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,792
giving you far more
than your share of our food.

938
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:25,758
The men begged me
to leave you where you lay,

939
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,192
but I could not do that.

940
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:33,596
And as a consequence, I saved your life.

941
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,238
You saved my life?

942
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,312
You saved my...

943
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,832
I demand an apology right now.

944
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,918
You will apologize to me.

945
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,998
I will apologize...

946
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Thank you.

947
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,989
...to my men.

948
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:01,875
I'm sorry I ever considered Mr. Murray
worthy of your company.

949
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:07,709
And as I ever mistook
a man's rank for his medal,

950
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,313
but I shall not make that mistake again.

951
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:18,838
What your purpose is
in this ambush, I cannot say.

952
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:23,349
But you need fear
no more embarrassment from me.

953
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,828
I hereby resign from this institution,

954
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,271
and I shall proceed on my own.

955
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,793
No, p-please, Major! Please!

956
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:34,073
This is outrageous!
Please, you must reconsider!

957
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,640
Magnus!

958
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,554
I shall teach him.

959
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
What's wrong?

960
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,994
You've received a letter.

961
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:16,792
All former officers not currently posted,
must send their names to the war office.

962
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,672
Let us hope it is a brief conflict.

963
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,080
Talk to the boys.

964
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,198
Don't be concerned, my love.

965
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,870
I've spent a whole life training for this.

966
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,794
Hello, boy.

967
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,200
Father.

968
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:53,880
Jack.

969
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:55,280
Brian.

970
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,309
Has Harvey been walked?

971
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,234
- Um, no, not yet.
- All right.

972
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,235
I'll do it.

973
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,760
Father, you will not have
to leave again, will you?

974
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:07,720
To fight?

975
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,633
If the reports are true,
I'm afraid I must.

976
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,433
Father, you've only just returned.

977
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,679
It's... it's hardly fair.

978
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,439
I'm obligated to serve.

979
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,080
Obligated.

980
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,192
What of your obligation to mother?

981
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,589
And to us?

982
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,400
Your family.

983
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,998
The... the family that you've chosen
to abandon for so many years.

984
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,080
Jack.

985
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,191
How dare you talk to me like that.

986
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,756
How dare... How dare you, father...

987
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,869
You do not think of us.

988
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:50,919
You think of lndians,

989
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,753
or Germans, or any other path
to glory that you can find.

990
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,000
Jack, stop it! That's enough!

991
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,112
Mother, I will not stop.
You have returned a failure.

992
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,478
The papers are full of it.
And you want to abandon us again?

993
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,800
- It's contemptuous...
- Enough!

994
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,760
Percy...

995
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:17,640
I hate him.

996
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,720
Oh, Jack.

997
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:23,874
Everything your father has done,
since the day you came into this world,

998
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,120
has been to better your life.

999
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,558
And for your sake, I hope, one day,

1000
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,756
you will come regret
the things you just said to him.

1001
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,600
Please, just go.

1002
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,916
Please. Please, just go.

1003
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,999
Well, what do you know, chief?

1004
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,031
It appears our old friend,
Mr. James Murray,

1005
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,314
is not so powerful after all.

1006
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,560
Why do you say that?

1007
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:24,276
The bastard's gone off on an
Artic expedition with Canadians and...

1008
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:26,240
mutinied.

1009
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,320
He's not been heard from since.

1010
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,520
Take a look.

1011
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:39,111
I'm sure his magnificent skills
will bring him back safely.

1012
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,350
Someone should warn the Eskimos

1013
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,750
that Mr. Murray is on the prowl.

1014
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:00,880
All right, Major.

1015
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,389
Mr. Costin!

1016
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:06,393
Despite the medium of fine
spiritualistic skills of the Russians.

1017
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,079
Come! She'll read your fortune.

1018
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,157
I can't believe he smuggled her in here.

1019
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:15,633
Welcome to the world beyond.

1020
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,520
- Sorry, chap. Come on.
- That's enough. It's the Major's turn.

1021
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,879
Move on. I'm with him.

1022
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,000
Let's see the Major's fortune.

1023
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,398
We will be in battle soon, madam.

1024
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,432
Any spiritual aid would be
greatly appreciated.

1025
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,113
You are the explorer?

1026
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,320
I was.

1027
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,438
As were these fine men,

1028
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:52,352
who have transferred here
so we could all be together.

1029
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,589
Give me your hand.

1030
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,309
Feel my hand.

1031
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,674
Listen to my voice.

1032
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,958
Is it... a forest?

1033
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:24,632
You dream to be in a forest.

1034
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:31,075
I wish to find a lost city.

1035
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:33,120
Can you...

1036
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,390
see yourself there now?

1037
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,949
Try to picture it in your mind.

1038
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,280
Yes.

1039
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:53,475
I can see it.

1040
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:00,110
You cannot blind yourself to this vision.

1041
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:02,875
What you seek...

1042
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,029
is far greater...

1043
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,434
than you ever imagined.

1044
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:15,356
A vast land bejeweled with peoples.

1045
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:24,872
Your soul will never be quiet
until you find this new place.

1046
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:30,632
It is your destiny.

1047
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,232
With it, you will illuminate the world.

1048
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,113
The whole world has set itself afire.

1049
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:52,950
I must look elsewhere to quench the blaze.

1050
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:22,954
Good morning, gentlemen.

1051
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:25,680
- Sir.
- Good morning, sir.

1052
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,274
When I was younger,

1053
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,231
I ventured all for king and country,

1054
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,439
for place and rank.

1055
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,669
I believed that to be
the makings of a man.

1056
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,111
But my travels have taught me,

1057
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,237
such ambitions

1058
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,393
are mere phantoms.

1059
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,478
I know in our hearts,

1060
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,750
we fight for our loves ones, as we should.

1061
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:10,869
But they are not here.

1062
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,468
So instead let us fight for each other.

1063
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,760
Good luck.

1064
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,909
And may God be with all of you.

1065
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,479
And fuck the bloody bush!

1066
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,432
Well said, Mr. Costin!

1067
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,670
Right men! Into positions!

1068
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,237
Take down the gunner!
Take down the gunner up ahead!

1069
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:27,509
Come on!

1070
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:34,833
Come on! Keep going!

1071
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,830
Come on! Push forward!

1072
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:06,595
Gas!

1073
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:09,720
Gas!

1074
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,560
Gas!

1075
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:21,795
Manley! Gas!

1076
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,479
Darling, it is I.

1077
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,919
We are here.

1078
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,028
The children are here.

1079
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,030
- Nina.
- Yes, my darling.

1080
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,280
Come.

1081
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,509
That is Joan.

1082
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,034
Let him feel your face. Come along.

1083
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,160
See?

1084
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,315
Brian.

1085
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,674
Where's Jack?

1086
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,080
Father, I'm here.

1087
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:37,357
I thought I had died.

1088
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:39,789
Oh, no.

1089
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:44,235
You were exposed to chlorine gas.

1090
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,679
Your eyes were affected,

1091
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:49,479
but they are very confident
that your sight shall return.

1092
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,919
The rest of the men?

1093
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:58,269
- Costin?
- Mr. Costin was unharmed.

1094
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,077
You'll brigade suffered many losses,

1095
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:05,311
but it was the only one
that did not retreat.

1096
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:09,917
Thanks to you bravery, they are raising
your rank to Lieutenant Colonel.

1097
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,675
Lieutenant Colonel?

1098
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,794
After all that he has done?

1099
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:16,600
Jack.

1100
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,474
I think I was dreaming...

1101
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,837
about Amazonia.

1102
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:28,480
I...

1103
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,350
I'm afraid you may never be able
to return to your jungle.

1104
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:35,670
I am sorry.

1105
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,360
Shh, my darling.

1106
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:38,948
Shh. Rest.

1107
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,233
All will be well.

1108
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,753
I must go back.

1109
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:48,909
But love...

1110
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,190
You cannot think
of these things right now.

1111
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,400
I'm going to take
the children for some air.

1112
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,080
Come along.

1113
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,480
Father.

1114
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:24,960
Jack.

1115
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:04,350
America has quite
a fascination with you.

1116
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,428
Our readers have been asking
where you've been since the war.

1117
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:09,760
I'm grateful for their interest.

1118
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:14,833
You may tell your readers
I've recovered from my wounds

1119
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,751
and have been adapting to home life.

1120
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,596
Your pursuits in South America
have led to a tremendous interest

1121
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:25,398
in exploration in the Unites States.

1122
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,471
There have been many new voyages planned.

1123
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:29,880
Have there?

1124
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:35,035
Yes, Dr. Hamilton Rice leaves for Brazil
soon with radio and airplanes.

1125
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,634
He's taking a large
and very well-armed party.

1126
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:42,908
Well, let us hope that Dr. Rice,
with all his arms,

1127
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,719
does not destroy what he
wishes to discover.

1128
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,395
- Allow me to ask you a question.
- Yes, sir.

1129
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,113
How did you find us here?

1130
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:55,909
Well, your son, Colonel.

1131
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,829
He wrote us a letter.

1132
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:00,715
Didn't he tell you?

1133
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,189
Good shot, Jack.

1134
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,200
Thank you, father.

1135
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:30,476
Getting quite expert with that rifle.

1136
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:33,879
Practice makes perfect, you know?

1137
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:08,473
I have something for you.

1138
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,393
This was given to me

1139
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:16,110
by a Guaraní lndian chief.

1140
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,560
Great man.

1141
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,520
It's yours now.

1142
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,080
Thank you.

1143
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,033
It must've been a glorious day.

1144
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,113
You still believe in Z, do you not?

1145
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:49,672
That we underestimated the lndian.

1146
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,439
That is why we should go back.

1147
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,069
You and I, together.

1148
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:01,832
We could find the city once and for all.

1149
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,360
Jack.

1150
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,952
I'm an old bastard now.

1151
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:24,037
Father, you and I, we both know it.
You easily outmatch my strengths.

1152
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,631
And now you can see as clear as day again.

1153
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:29,959
There is nothing stopping us.

1154
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,040
Father.

1155
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:39,596
The Americans will
venture there with their guns.

1156
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:43,754
And then we must pray that they
do not destroy the lndian.

1157
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,638
We must find it before they do.

1158
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,591
I want nothing more than
to go with you, Father.

1159
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,560
It's everything you've always wanted.

1160
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:11,435
You would have to consult
a higher authority.

1161
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:16,392
I understand that it's dangerous,

1162
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:19,336
But you've said so yourself
with everything that's happened in Europe,

1163
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,920
it's not possible to choose
a safe passage through life.

1164
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:25,433
So many men near my own age
did not return from the war.

1165
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:28,589
And who is to say
it will not happen again?

1166
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,759
It could, mother.

1167
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:32,880
It could happen again.

1168
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,155
By all accounts, I should be furious
because you've just...

1169
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:41,035
You've just used my very own
words against me.

1170
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,831
And how can I refute them?
They are my own.

1171
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:46,638
Joan's been so annoying!
Bloody slapped me!

1172
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:48,551
All right, Joan, don't slap him.

1173
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:50,631
Thank you. Off! Go on!

1174
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,149
She hit me around the face.

1175
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:54,151
Brian, I'm in the middle
of a conversation!

1176
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:56,960
Go and help you sister get some wood,
please, from the log pile now.

1177
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Now!

1178
01:47:58,440 --> 01:47:59,634
Fight your own battles!

1179
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,560
Momma, please.

1180
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:25,360
There is little doubt
that I would worry night and day

1181
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,678
about my boys in the jungle.

1182
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,235
But we have never let fear
determine our future.

1183
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:42,280
That's all.

1184
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:48,029
Mother, thank you.

1185
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,599
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1186
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,831
- Father, this...
- Jack, Jack, Jack.

1187
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:59,357
- We are not there yet.
- I know.

1188
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,080
We'll have to raise
a great deal of money.

1189
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:02,673
Of course, I understand. Yes.

1190
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:06,718
Go on. Let me talk to your mother.

1191
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:08,389
And training?

1192
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:10,671
Well, of course,
I shall begin right away.

1193
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,988
You and I, and Mr. Costin
I'm sure would love to join us.

1194
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:16,959
Thank you, mother. Thank you.

1195
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:26,240
What?

1196
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:30,235
I'm just surprised you agreed so quickly.

1197
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,829
What choice did I have?

1198
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:38,873
It's his essential nature;
would be wrong to betray that.

1199
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,836
Besides, you will be there to guide him.

1200
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:47,794
Here they are, Chief.

1201
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:51,519
Here's the last of my notebooks.

1202
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:53,789
A map would be helpful.

1203
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,557
Can I truly not persuade you to come?

1204
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:10,596
We came so close, Henry.

1205
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:13,758
Think of what it would mean...

1206
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,197
To finally find it together.

1207
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,632
Chief, I have a wife and child now.

1208
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:31,915
My own children were
younger than yours is now

1209
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,513
when we went on our first trip.

1210
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:37,636
Can't say it was not a sacrifice.

1211
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,757
But if you could see my boy now,

1212
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,392
his vim and vigor,

1213
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:51,075
I guarantee it would tear down
your resistance in an instant.

1214
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,880
Would you like
some more brandy, sir?

1215
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:56,638
Nope. Thank you, Nigel.

1216
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,800
- For yourself, sir?
- No, thank you.

1217
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,232
Chief, please don't
misunderstand me. I'm...

1218
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:05,949
But it's something...

1219
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,911
This search for Z...

1220
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,752
I can no longer bear the cost.

1221
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,196
You've come to doubt its existence?

1222
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:28,120
No.

1223
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:31,998
I only doubt Z could provide
all the answers you seek from it.

1224
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:36,631
I wish you success, my dear friend.

1225
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,748
This will be
no pampered expedition.

1226
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,311
Top heavy missions get nowhere.

1227
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:49,033
They linger on the fringe of civilization
and bask in publicity.

1228
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:50,120
We will not.

1229
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:52,471
We will be in the field for three years,

1230
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:55,509
standing on our own two feet,

1231
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:57,952
surviving by our wits.

1232
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:01,553
Tribesmen shall take our dispatchers

1233
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:04,473
to be delivered for publication
as often as possible.

1234
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:07,438
But who's going to finance
this latest journey of yours?

1235
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:12,755
The money is generously being supplied
by a consortium of American newspapers

1236
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:15,593
and Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr.

1237
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,995
Are you aware The Royal
Geographical Society

1238
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:21,389
has just offered to help
with the financing?

1239
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:24,153
I'm glad to see our nation
is not to be left behind.

1240
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:29,474
I would like now to introduce
my companion for this historic expedition,

1241
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,753
my own son, Mr. Jack Fawcett.

1242
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:37,631
He is a man of great discipline
and keenest muscle.

1243
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:40,952
Well, we couldn't very well be shamed
by the Americans now could we?

1244
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:45,515
No, but I am proud to say
that we did finally

1245
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,352
manage to meet them halfway.

1246
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:52,833
Sir George, God rest his soul,
always bore you great affection.

1247
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:58,510
But I admit my error in not accepting
your beliefs long ago.

1248
01:52:58,600 --> 01:52:59,600
Oh.

1249
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:02,631
All that matters now is the future.

1250
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,720
Yes.

1251
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,839
I have carried this

1252
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:10,912
for the last twenty years.

1253
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:13,835
When we reach Z,

1254
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,597
I shall send it to you as a sign.

1255
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:20,796
Just in case I decide not to come back.

1256
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,472
Oh, nonsense, nonsense.

1257
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:26,996
Oh, now we have something for you.

1258
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:29,357
Mr. Barkley, please.

1259
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,314
The society's highest honor,

1260
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:36,193
the Founder's Gold Medal.

1261
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:41,433
You are
truly deserving, Colonel.

1262
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:44,990
- Truly.
- Indeed.

1263
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:55,200
All the arrangements are made.
We leave for Portugal on the seventh,

1264
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:57,280
and then we meet again in Brazil.

1265
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,753
No one can best us now.

1266
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:07,116
Remember, the code with the coordinates
is in my desk, and Mr. Costin

1267
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:09,919
- has a copy in safekeeping.
- Yes, you've told me a thousand times.

1268
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,560
Now run along or you'll miss your boat.

1269
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:23,553
You're a man now; responsible
for you mother and sister's care.

1270
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:25,829
It's a fine calling.

1271
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:29,553
No less, perhaps even
more virtuous than ours.

1272
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:32,320
All right?

1273
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:35,480
Goodbye, father.

1274
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,798
I shall indeed miss you as I always have.

1275
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:43,000
- Look after your father for me.
- Of course, I will, of course.

1276
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,314
- And have fun.
- Yes.

1277
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:45,400
And be bold.

1278
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:48,160
Goodbye, Joan.

1279
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:51,109
Goodbye, father.

1280
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:52,880
I love you.

1281
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,480
On to Z then,

1282
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:58,549
and to new history!

1283
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:07,715
Goodbye, the boys!

1284
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:09,600
Woo!

1285
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,113
Forty million, father!

1286
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:35,954
Paper says forty million people
are following our journey!

1287
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:37,920
It's incredible!

1288
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:43,440
It's wonderful.

1289
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:27,680
How are you faring?

1290
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:29,709
Never felt better.

1291
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:31,555
Neither have I.

1292
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:34,229
We'll be on the river soon,

1293
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,432
and if we're lucky to see an opera.

1294
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,154
This is where they sang?

1295
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,160
It's astonishing.

1296
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:18,430
It's just a pity you
couldn't see it intact.

1297
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,160
Yes.

1298
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:25,477
The jungle is
restoring the balance.

1299
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:32,708
Dearest Cheeky,

1300
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:36,949
This is the last letter
you shall receive until we reach Z.

1301
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:40,229
The rest of our party is returning home.

1302
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:45,274
Jack is acquitting himself marvelously.

1303
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,949
Today we reached a tribe of Indians

1304
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:55,155
who told us of a cave entirely unknown
to anyone outside of their clan...

1305
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,070
They tell of an enormous rock there,

1306
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:07,232
covered with painted pictures
of men and horses.

1307
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:12,229
It's location is, perhaps,
the gateway to Z...

1308
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:17,040
The chief has been
very generous to us here,

1309
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:22,270
and he reminds me, yet again,
that we are all made of the same clay...

1310
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:48,519
I expect we will be in touch
with the old civilization within months.

1311
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:53,272
Thereafter, our fate is
in the lap of the gods.

1312
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,554
You need have no fear of any failure.

1313
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,149
Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

1314
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:25,880
Stay calm.

1315
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,675
I know the approach just keep going.

1316
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:41,600
Amigos.

1317
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Amigos.

1318
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:47,240
Amigos.

1319
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:49,200
Amigos.

1320
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:01,552
All right, come on back the way we came.

1321
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,630
Slowly, slowly, don't rush.

1322
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:20,393
Into the brush! Go!

1323
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:30,496
Jack!

1324
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:31,680
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1325
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:56,192
No, Jack! Keep going! Keep going!

1326
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:00,399
Be brave.

1327
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:06,950
Nothing will happen to us
that is not our destiny.

1328
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:47,440
We're going to die.

1329
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:54,151
We're going
to die here today.

1330
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:03,398
So much of life is a mystery, my boy.

1331
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:11,068
We know so little of this world.

1332
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:21,997
But you and I have made a journey that
other men cannot even imagine.

1333
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,997
And this has given
understanding to our hearts.

1334
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:36,635
I love you, father.

1335
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:42,513
I love you, son.

1336
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:32,196
A toast, shall we?

1337
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:35,113
Actually, Lord Bernard, I wanted...

1338
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:37,478
I wanted to read something if I could.

1339
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:40,509
Now I'm in for it.

1340
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:45,513
It's something I wrote in the event
that I did not survive the birth.

1341
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:54,957
"My Percy, I know your first
instinct will be to grieve,

1342
02:06:56,280 --> 02:07:00,193
but I adjure you rather
to consider our son

1343
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:03,278
and the love you must show him.

1344
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:07,639
I knew it would be a boy.

1345
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:13,594
Always teach him to dream,
to seek the unknown,

1346
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:19,276
to look for what is beautiful
is its own reward.

1347
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:25,276
And I beg you to remember
those words so easy to forget:

1348
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:27,909
A man's reach...

1349
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:30,998
should exceed his grasp,

1350
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,158
or what's a Heaven for?

1351
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:38,751
My dearest love, forever."

1352
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:32,269
A man came to see me yesterday.

1353
02:08:36,440 --> 02:08:37,714
He was from Brazil.

1354
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:41,554
He has seen...

1355
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:44,473
Jack and Percy...

1356
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:47,792
living with the lndians.

1357
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:51,999
He says they claim...

1358
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:54,552
to have reached Z.

1359
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:02,072
My dear, it's... it's...

1360
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:04,428
It's been years.

1361
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:11,073
We've sent almost 100 men to look
for your husband and your son, and...

1362
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:15,873
I fear we have to accept the inevitable.

1363
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:26,674
Sir John, I confess that the brutal
wear and tear is great,

1364
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:32,389
and I suffer with heart and soul.

1365
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:37,754
It has taken...

1366
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:41,436
all my strength of will

1367
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,629
to push horrors from my mind,
but I beg you...

1368
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:50,152
not to lose confidence.

1369
02:09:55,240 --> 02:09:56,240
I cannot...

1370
02:09:57,080 --> 02:09:58,080
doubt...

1371
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:02,590
after so many years of sacrifice.

1372
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:06,709
It has become...

1373
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:09,798
my own life's work.

1374
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:24,960
The Brazilian gave me this to give to you.

1375
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:28,349
He said Percy told him
you would understand.

1376
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:36,150
I have trained myself
to be impartial to evidence, but surely...

1377
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:39,352
Surely, this is a sign.

1378
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:44,560
Yes.

1379
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:46,879
I will have it examined.

1380
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:50,960
Thank you.

1381
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:53,354
That is all I can ask.

1381
02:10:54,305 --> 02:11:54,923
