1
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,085
<i>Here's a question for you.</i>

2
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,085
<i>What do kids need more?
A father or a dad?</i>

3
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,731
<i>What's the difference?</i>

4
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,884
<i>The way I see it, darn near
anyone can be a father</i>

5
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,369
<i>but not everyone has the patience
or the devotion to be a dad.</i>

6
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,721
As for me...

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,040
Anybody caught a Monarch yet?

8
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,924
<i>...I've always wanted to be a dad.</i>

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,571
<i>Let me tell you, I love it!</i>

10
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,641
Yeah!

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,491
<i>And I love my Ford Flex.</i>

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,321
<i>It treats me to a smooth ride,
and you know what?</i>

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,686
<i>It didn't break the bank.</i>

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,202
<i>Room enough for the whole family.</i>

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,527
<i>Yes, I love being a dad.</i>

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,926
<i>And I love these two adorable
little rays of sunshine.</i>

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,490
Hey, Dylan! Good morning.

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,561
Whatever.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,767
<i>Okay. I'm not their real dad.</i>

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,526
Good morning, Mr. Whitaker.

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,728
<i>- I'm their step dad.
- Good morning, Megan.</i>

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,484
Can you please put this on the fridge?

23
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,680
Well, sure. Did you do
another drawing of our family?

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,483
That's me and Dylan and Mommy.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,647
So great.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,769
And over here, far, far away,

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,321
is you.

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,208
And am I wearing a baseball cap?

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,888
That's the knife in your head
'cause I was killing you in the eye.

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,681
I see.

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,364
Well, I love how you drew my hair.

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,201
That's poop.

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,565
Well, it's well-drawn.
And I'm guessing it's dog poop?

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,330
That's homeless man poop.

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,641
All right.

36
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,762
<i>I actually can't father my own children,</i>

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,525
<i>ever since I hit a little
snafu at a dental office.</i>

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,723
I've got a little bit of a gag reflex.

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,009
Close your eyes, breathe through
your nose, you'll be fine.

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,241
Okay.

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,570
You got a really weird tongue.
You need to floss better.

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,088
<i>Ever since then, my testicles have been
more decorative than anything else.</i>

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,207
Hey!

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,442
<i>And I thought I'd never have a family.</i>

45
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,003
<i>Until I met a stunning mom named Sara.</i>

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,445
<i>Would you look at her?</i>

47
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,843
<i>I am one lucky so-and-so.
I hit the jackpot.</i>

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,161
- Hi.
- Hi.

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,930
Sorry I'm taking so long.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,401
I have to show that Sixty West
building to those new clients.

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,481
I know.

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,245
- Oh, my God! The kids' lunches.
- Already packed. I wrote them

53
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,687
little inspirational notes
to start them on their day.

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,081
They've already eaten their breakfasts,
and you look perfect.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,090
You are amazing.

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,966
Look at this, huh?
Another family drawing.

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,088
No. I am so sorry.

58
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,766
No, I think you're misunderstanding.
This is the first drawing

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,922
where I'm not dead already.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,409
Sure, I've got a knife in my eye

61
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,209
and some homeless man
poop on my head,

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,651
but this is showing real progress.

63
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,643
I think she's starting to accept me.

64
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,762
You can find the good
in just about anything.

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,081
I love that about you. You know that?

66
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,601
Thanks.

67
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,008
Hello. I'm home.

68
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,361
Hey-

69
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,131
How was the...

70
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,641
What's wrong?

71
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,802
He won't talk to me.
He said he only wants to talk to you.

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,647
You want to talk to me?

73
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,210
Really?

74
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,281
You mean me and your mom?

75
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,849
Just me? By myself?

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,410
Sure. I'm...

77
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,130
I'm totally free. Let's go to the den.
We'll sit there.

78
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,561
We'll sit.
We can do it sitting or standing?

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,844
Doesn't matter. We're just gonna do it.

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,891
We're not gonna overthink it.
Yeah. Great. Okay, good.

81
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,004
Just the men, yeah.
A little rap session. Great.

82
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,841
Oh, my God.

83
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,003
I just want you to know that
I'm just here to listen. All right?

84
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,046
No judgments, no lectures,
just a compassionate ear.

85
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,247
Well, there are these kids at school...

86
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,527
...and they're bigger than me,
because they're fourth graders.

87
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,407
And...

88
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,885
Was that weird?

89
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,851
I'm sorry, I'm just...

90
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,409
It's a big moment for me,
and I'm just trying to capture it.

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,845
It just came off awkward.

92
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,887
So, go ahead, continue telling
your story. Fourth graders.

93
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,122
Anyway, there are
these fourth graders, and...

94
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,924
He actually confided in me.

95
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,283
I mean, it was that father-son feeling
I've been dying for,

96
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,045
and it was even better than
I thought it was gonna be.

97
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,169
I mean, he really needed me. Me.

98
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,446
That is so great, honey.

99
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,806
He even said not to tell you.

100
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,770
So I'm actually totally
betraying his trust right now.

101
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,807
What are we gonna do about
those little snot-nosed fourth graders?

102
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,365
I think it's going to be fine.

103
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,967
He's going to try to do some
trust falls on the playground.

104
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,606
Really? You think that's gonna work?

105
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,888
As long as they catch him. Yeah.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,001
Hey, Brad.

107
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,441
Yeah?

108
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,683
If I ask you something, you
promise you won't cry again?

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,525
Of course, sweetie. What is it?

110
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,285
Well, at school,
they told us about this thing,

111
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,124
and it's called a Daddy-Daughter Dance.

112
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,805
So, do you want to go with me?

113
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,930
You said you wouldn't cry, Brad.

114
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,846
I'm not. Megan, yes. A million times yes.

115
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,083
I thought big people
weren't supposed to cry.

116
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,970
I think it's sweet that he's
crying like a little bitch.

117
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,321
Megan!

118
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,209
You are not supposed
to call people that word.

119
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,524
You know what? It takes a real
man to show his emotions.

120
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,205
All right, that's a bit much.

121
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,887
<i>No more rhymes now, I mean it!</i>

122
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,400
<i>Anybody want a peanut?</i>

123
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,045
<i>We were finally becoming a family.</i>

124
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,601
<i>I'll get it!</i>

125
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,524
<i>After being pushed away
and treated like an outsider,</i>

126
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,291
<i>I was finally becoming
the dad that I always knew I could...</i>

127
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,527
Daddy!

128
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,247
Hi! Where are you?

129
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,051
Where's Cameroon?

130
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,202
Is that gunfire? Cool!

131
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,528
Daddy, Daddy! I want to talk to Daddy.

132
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,721
Hi, Daddy.

133
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,041
Good.

134
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,083
- So your ex is calling, huh?
- Yeah.

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,010
What a treat for the kids.
It's been a long time.

136
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,206
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

137
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,404
We're watching a really funny
movie with Mommy and Brad.

138
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,530
Brad is Mommy's new husband.

139
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,570
Wait. He doesn't know about me?

140
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,400
Well, I haven't talked to him
in six months.

141
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,960
We've been married eight months.

142
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,849
Brad, Daddy wants to talk to you.

143
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,287
- No! No, no. Don't, don't...
- I'm just going to say hi.

144
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,885
You don't need to do that. Brad, don't.

145
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,724
Thank you, sweetie.

146
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,766
Hello, Dusty?
Super to make your acquaintance.

147
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,324
In fact, I just wish
I could shake your hand

148
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,562
and offer to buy you a cold one.

149
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,651
- Tomorrow?
- What?

150
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,848
Daddy's coming! Yay!

151
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,085
Yeah, I guess I could pick you up.

152
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,601
No.

153
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,081
It's Whitaker.

154
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,171
W-H-I-T-A-K-E-R.

155
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,521
No, I'm not comfortable giving you

156
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,931
my Social Security number
over the phone.

157
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,484
Okay, yeah, my credit score is 752.

158
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,721
I'm very proud of that.

159
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,247
I'm sorry? What sort of fighting styles
am I proficient in?

160
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,570
I don't know if I've ever been
asked that before.

161
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,007
Hello, Dusty, hello, hello?

162
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,486
I lost him.

163
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,922
What just happened?
Did you just invite him to come here?

164
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,610
Is he coming tomorrow?

165
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,405
Well, I didn't know
he'd accept my offer so soon.

166
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,369
I mean, he reallyjumped at it.

167
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,920
Remember when I said
he was like Jesse James

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,411
and Mick Jagger had a baby?

169
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,768
Yeah, I just thought maybe
he was really skinny and

170
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,606
jittery, and had like a little bit
of a British accent, or something.

171
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,251
He's wild and he's crazy.
That's why I fell in love with him.

172
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,646
Then you end up with two kids.

173
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,291
And I'm stuck there holding the bag and
he's nowhere to be found.

174
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,203
It doesn't matter how much
love or passion,

175
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,645
or you can't breathe
without each other.

176
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,728
All of that stuff is stupid in comparison.

177
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,525
When you have kids,
you have responsibilities.

178
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,721
He doesn't understand that.

179
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,644
Honey, this is actually a good thing.

180
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,370
I'll welcome Dusty into our home,

181
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,643
and we'll establish some kind
but firm boundaries.

182
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,804
All right? It's what Step-By-Stepdad
calls "setting up a Loving Fence."

183
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,725
A Loving Fence?
Wow, that sounds really great, honey.

184
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,725
But your self-help books
have never met Dusty Mayron.

185
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,405
He sounds like a rascal,

186
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,244
but I don't think
it's anything I can't handle.

187
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,641
<i>Check. Check, check.</i>

188
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,644
Chinese Checkers,
Czech, Czech Republic, pop,

189
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,083

check, check, check, check.

191
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,447
What do you got for me, Brad?

192
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,082
Mr. Holt, hello. Well, hopefully
the new voice of The Panda.

193
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,241
Listen.

194
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,768
I gotta leave early today. I gotta go
pick up my wife's ex at the airport.

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,924
Jesus, kid, how'd you
draw that shit detail?

196
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,562
Brad, why do you want
this deadbeat in your home?

197
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,286
Well, it's not that
I want him in my home,

198
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,840
it's just that the better
stepparenting books

199
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,207
say that the worst thing
you can do for the kids

200
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,123
is to push out the biological.

201
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,840
You're in the danger zone here,
Brad, and let me tell you why.

202
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,761
Kids that grow up without their dads
always end up obsessing over them.

203
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,766
Most of the hook-ups
that I've had in my adult life

204
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,683
have been with women
that had daddy issues.

205
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,569
I don't know if this is
an appropriate story.

206
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,842
Look, my wife would kill me
if she knew I was telling you this.

207
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,570
Well, then you shouldn't tell me this.

208
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,887
When I met her in Denver...

209
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,121
You're going to tell the story, aren't you?

210
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,804
...she was a topless maid.

211
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,564
Ninety-nine bucks an hour.

212
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,963
Never met her father.
But who did she meet? Me.

213
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,443
And who did treat her like shit? Me.

214
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,806
I eventually loved her,

215
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,803
but every time she got out of line,

216
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,962
I'd just pull the Humvee over

217
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,565
and ask her to get out politely.

218
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,045
And then I'd drive away.

219
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,405
Guess what?
She showed up at home every time.

220
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,086
This story has no relevance
to my situation.

221
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,641
It doesn't at all. It's just a good story.

222
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,643
So, Pete, are we going
to hear this guy, or what?

223
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,290
<i>One-oh-three-point-six</i>

224
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,244
<i>The Panda!</i>

225
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,401
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,765
Keep it up, Brad.
You and I will fight in the parking lot.

227
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,160
So today is the day

228
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,242
I'm finally meeting
the father of my children.

229
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,251
Am I nervous? You're darn right I am.

230
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,091
But who wouldn't be?

231
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,567
And here's the thing.
I mean, Pepe, you know, kids...

232
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,809
...they see through things and,
at the end of the day,

233
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,691
they know who's been around...

234
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,485
Holy balls!

235
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,966
I hope that's not him.

236
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,768
There is no doubt this man
is your better in every way.

237
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,642
Well, you're kind to say that. Thank you.

238
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,641
Yeah, I feel pretty good.

239
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,163
- Hey, you Dusty?
- Nope.

240
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,961
What?

241
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,365
Are you sure?

242
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,243
Are you Dusty... No, you're not Dusty.

243
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,323
<i>You've got

244
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,482
<i>the station everybody

245
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,761

00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,921
<i>Now if you're up in Wolf Trap
this weekend,</i>

247
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,490
<i>do yourself a favor and check out...</i>

248
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,527
Hey! Where have you been?

249
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,326
I called you like 100 times.

250
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,323
I know, my phone died. Look...

251
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,001
This motorcycle, is this...

252
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,161
Yes. He's here.

253
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,520
- He's here?
- Yes.

254
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,090
What's he doing inside there?

255
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,128
He's giving the kids
all kinds of Starbursts.

256
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,283
Starbursts? God damn it!

257
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,807
Sorry. Sorry.

258
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,841
I'm a hot habanero pepper right now.

259
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,930
I got a few bullet points I want to
bring up with our friend Dusty,

260
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,568
starting with airport etiquette,
courtesy and expectation.

261
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,125
Good story, Daddy!

262
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,203
You like that story? It's all true. Hey!

263
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,441
Who wants some more Starbursts

264
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,046
and a couple of
uncirculated silver dollars?

265
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,611
So you are Dusty.

266
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,645
I sure am. You must be
the new and improved husband.

267
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,404
Bring it in, big guns.

268
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,050
I already met you at the airport.

269
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,366
No, I don't recall that, friend.

270
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,323
Yeah, I walked right up to you
and asked if you were Dusty.

271
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,562
I'm pretty sure I'd remember
a heavy hitter like yourself.

272
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,006
Well, must have been my mistake.

273
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,210
All right, that was me at the airport.

274
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,850
- Yeah, I know that.
- The truth is,

275
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,331
I saw you before you saw me,

276
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,528
and I'm thinking,
"This is the guy who's raising my kids?"

277
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,922
"And damn it if he doesn't
look like the real deal."

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,081
I mean, look at you.

279
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,650
You figured it out, didn't you?

280
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,846
You cracked the code.

281
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,251
I don't know about that.

282
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,845
Don't play that humble game with me.

283
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,120
He is so humble. He's just too humble.

284
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,608
Honey, you got it goin' on.
Everybody says so.

285
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,603
Yeah, I got it goin' way on.

286
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,604
So you can understand
why I panicked at the airport.

287
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,081
- I froze, Brad. I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

288
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,202
Look, these are
tricky waters to navigate.

289
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,682
They sure are, man. I mean,
that is insightful.

290
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,521
You know, I thought it was weird Sara
didn't tell me about you before.

291
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,045
I thought, what's she hiding?

292
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,611
And now I know.

293
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,681
A champion.

294
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,125
Hey, Brad!
Did you see Dad's motorcycle?

295
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,601
Isn't it cool?

296
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,681
It sure is.

297
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,610
What is that, an Indian?

298
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,801
Yep.

299
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,646
I believe they're manufactured
in Minneapolis.

300
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,962
I've never been, but that's

301
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,644
<i>the setting for
The Mary Tyler Moore Show.</i>

302
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,486
And... What's the other... Rhoda.

303
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,962
Which I want to say was a spin-off.

304
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,044
Damn! You really know
your bikes, Brad. You ride?

305
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,121
Yeah!

306
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,481
- Really?
- Yeah.

307
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,166
I mean, not anymore. I did, you know,

308
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,568
back in college. I had a...

309
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,166
I had a Kawa-saki? Kawasaki Nine.

310
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,406
Yeah.

311
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,405
With the fenders and the...
The broil joint. So...

312
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,641
Well, you should get on her, man.
Come on!

313
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,091
Take her out, see what she can do.

314
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,127
She's got a lot of power.

315
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,361
No,no,no.

316
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,044
Yeah, Brad! Brad... Please!

317
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,202
No. Hey, come on, kids.
It's time for bed.

318
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,089
It's way past your bedtime.
Let's brush your teeth.

319
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,481
All right, come on, guys,
listen to your mom. Hey, look...

320
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,841
I don't want to overstep, but

321
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,244
it would mean the world to me
if I could tuck in our two little blessings.

322
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,563
Yeah. Yeah, sure, of course.
They're your kids. Tuck away.

323
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,364
Thank you for that, Brad.

324
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,522
The King messed up.
He messed up bad.

325
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,286
He thought he could just
ride off to slay dragons,

326
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,840
and his Queen would always be
waiting for him.

327
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,963
And then one day
the King received word

328
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,883
that his dominion was being ruled over

329
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,202
by some curly-headed Step King
with good credit?

330
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,361
No!

331
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,124
Well, the King rode hard
up on his lands,

332
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,611
and when he arrived,

333
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,362
he did gaze fondly upon the Queen,
remembering their good times together,

334
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,324
for he had known her in her prime,
when she was down for anything,

335
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,890
and I do mean anything.

336
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,090
Sounds like your dad's spinning
quite a yarn. Mind if I listen in?

337
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,731
Actually, it's getting late.
You two need to get some sack time.

338
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,723
No, we want more story, please!

339
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,646
Hey, I'd love to be in here all night,
but let's be respectful of Brad's rules,

340
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,722
no matter how arbitrary they seem.
All right?

341
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,162
Good night, my little golden treasures.

342
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,485
Good night, my little magical cherubs.

343
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,643
Here comes some butterfly kisses.

344
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,290
And some Eskimo kisses.

345
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,484
Good night, buddy.
Sleep tight. Sleep tight.

346
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,165
Hey, who wants good-night tickles?

347
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,605
Me!

348
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,808
Good night, my little breath of God.

349
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,845
Good night, my little Jesus teardrop.

350
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,845
I almost forgot, my famous
good-night back scratches.

351
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,002
So relaxing, so relaxing.

352
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,161
Good night, sweetie bear.

353
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,969
Hey, who wants twenty bucks?

354
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,724
- I do! Me!
- Twenty dollars?

355
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,404
- What?
- Yeah.

356
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,562
One for you, and one for you.

357
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,687
I don't know if that's appropriate.

358
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,761
Don't worry about it.

359
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,921
Okay. Good night.

360
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,923
So, if you want to, why don't you
come by tomorrow after school?

361
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,127
Might be a good time to...

362
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,281
What about the cold one?

363
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,361
The cold one?

364
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,522
You promised me
a cold one and a handshake.

365
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,443
Cold one. One cold one, coming up.

366
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,204
Great. I'll grab my jacket,
we'll go outside.

367
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,520
Perfect. All right.

368
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,441
Hey!

369
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,285
What are you doing?
What are you guys buddies now?

370
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,886
No. I mean, I offered him a cold one.

371
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,122
I really should honor
the cold one promise.

372
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,842
Fine. You give him a cold one,
and then you get rid of him, okay?

373
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,122
You put up your
Loving Fence, remember?

374
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,004
- Then you come to bed.
- Okay.

375
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,121
- Will do.
- Okay.

376
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,405
What you got going on over here?

377
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,486
That's a treehouse. A little,

378
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,164
bonding project for Dylan and I.

379
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,721
Yeah, we've been at it
for about two months.

380
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,001
It's looking good.

381
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,161
Thank you.

382
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,371
So, Dusty, how long do you think
you're going to be in town for?

383
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,129
Well, Brad, the truth is,
I'm wheels-up a week from tomorrow.

384
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,441
Time to get out there and
kick some ass for America.

385
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,847
I see. So you're a soldier?

386
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,001
Nope.

387
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,401
So you're a...

388
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,681
Yep.

389
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,605
Yep, what?

390
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,604
You don't want to know
any more than that, Brad.

391
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,601
Okay.

392
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,531
Listen, Dusty, I think that we should
set up a visitation schedule.

393
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,561
Right? That way, you feel like
you have ample time with the children...

394
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,210
Why don't we cut the shit, Brad?

395
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,682
No, we don't have to cut the shit.

396
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,646
You want to know what I'm doing here,
why don't you quit looking at

397
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,210
whatever you wrote on your hand?

398
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,364
Be a man and ask me, Brad.

399
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,887
Okay. What are you doing here?

400
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,522
We both know kids need
a single primary male role model.

401
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,723
Sara's made her choice.

402
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,282
I'm man enough to
let that role model be you.

403
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,888
I will vouch for you with my children.

404
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,045
I will give them my sacred
permission to trust you.

405
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,891
To love you and to

406
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,411
call you Dad.

407
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,921
You'd do that for me?

408
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,081
No.

409
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,724
But I will do it for them.

410
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,602
That is what you want, isn't it, Brad?

411
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,122
More than anything in the world.

412
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,090
He played you.
You just got so played out there.

413
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,169
I know it looks that way,

414
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,163
'cause I promised
I would ask him to leave,

415
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,722
and then I invited him to stay for a week,
but he didn't play me.

416
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,201
You know what he did? He cut the shit.

417
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,004
- He did?
- And I gotta say,

418
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,645
it was refreshing.

419
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,088
I think more of us could stand
to just cut the shit, you know.

420
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,004
- Right.
- In one conversation,

421
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,601
he just blew by
eight chapters in my stepdad book.

422
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,001
I mean, this is gonna be so good
for me and the kids.

423
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,084
Baby, you have no idea
who you're dancing with.

424
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,761
Dusty gets into your head,
that's what he does.

425
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,684
He has a very impressive,
rugged bravado,

426
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,843
there's no question. But I gotta say,

427
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,164
I think in here, there's
a soft, soft creamy center.

428
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,682
You know? I think he feels a lot.

429
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,923
He just... He needs
someone with this, a big ear.

430
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,610
And I got them.

431
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,884
Good morning, Dusty.

432
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,371
- Hey.
- You're up and at 'em.

433
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,521
Yeah, I got up early

434
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,721
-and did a quick 20.
- Really?

435
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,564
- Twenty minutes of what?
- Twenty miles.

436
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,325
Did a little light sparring,
then lwhipped up

437
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,164
a pan of piping-hot
cinnamon rolls for my family.

438
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,846
I made one for you, too.

439
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,691
Wow. That's very impressive, thank you.

440
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,367
- Good morning, gang!
-It smells yummy!

441
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,444
Our real dad's a super,
super-duper good cook!

442
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,085
Here you go, guys-

443
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,443
Yeah, it looks an awful lot
like Cinnabon.

444
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,443
Well, thank you, Brad.
What a nice thing to say.

445
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,364
It tastes exactly like Cinnabon!

446
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,125
In fact, same shape,
same swirl, same frosting.

447
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,281
Well, now you're starting to
embarrass me,

448
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,646
but I do appreciate the compliment.

449
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,851
Good morning, Sar-bear!

450
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,969
- Morning.
- Hey, listen, guys,

451
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,611
Brad and I had a talk last night
about the importance of family.

452
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,206
And now that everyone's here,
I wanted to say a few words, okay?

453
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,441
I think that would be great.

454
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,286
Hey, kids, families can be ever-growing
and changing things.

455
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,250
And sometimes someone new
knocks on the door of your heart

456
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,641
and you're not sure if you
have room in there for one more.

457
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,405
But there's someone here now
I hope you guys can learn to love.

458
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,521
Okay?

459
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,007
Come here, boy!

460
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,605
A doggy!

461
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,481
You brought a dog home?

462
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,925
Yeah. Is that a problem?

463
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,048
You seemed really into it
while I was teeing it up.

464
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,485
No, I thought you were talking about me.

465
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,085
- But you're not a dog, Brad.
- No...

466
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,562
Look, last night, when we talked...

467
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,002
Yeah. Well, listen,
that's got to happen organically.

468
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,201
Why can't it happen now?

469
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,327
It just can't.

470
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,447
You're dirty.

471
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,567
Dusty, how old is that thing?

472
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,205
I'd guess him to be around 15.

473
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,363
I found him this morning,
living in a storm drain.

474
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,968
I named him Tumor,
because of how much he grows on you.

475
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,042
Mommy, can we keep Tumor, please?

476
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,770
I'm gonna leave this one up to Brad.

477
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,410
Please, Brad! Please!

478
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,805
Why is he looking at me like that?

479
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,685
He's only looking at me.

480
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,763
Maybe we just get a puppy instead?

481
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,491
A puppy, Brad? What are they
going to learn from a puppy?

482
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,764
An old dog like Tumor here's
been out in the world, man. Living free.

483
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,480
Fighting for survival and seeing things
we can only dream of.

484
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,848
Just look at the wisdom
in those cloudy eyes.

485
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,043
Besides, you know what happens
to old dogs at shelters.

486
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,122
He's gonna have to walk the green mile
as soon as he gets there.

487
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,248
No, Brad, no! Don't kill our dog!

488
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,651
I hate you!

489
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,642
Okay. Okay. Fine.

490
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,764
He can live out his few
remaining weeks with us.

491
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,485
Yay! Thanks, Brad.

492
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,886
I don't hate you anymore.

493
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,087
He's going potty!

494
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,725
Oh, my God.

495
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,450
We'll clean it up. We don't mind.

496
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,846
Look at that.

497
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,410
The dog's already
teaching them responsibility.

498
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,528
Hey, guys, when you got to
pick up the potty, use gloves.

499
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,931
He's definitely got worms in his poo.

500
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,127
Dusty! Can you please move this thing?

501
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,810
I can't get my car out of the garage.

502
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,928
Hey, Brad, do you mind?
I want to grab a quick shower.

503
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,048
Yeah, sure, no problem.

504
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,366
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, sweetie.

505
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,527
It's blocking everything.

506
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,046
No, I know. I know, don't worry.
We're on top of it.

507
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,441
What are you doing? Brad, I don't...

508
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,327
Hey! Stay away from that, please.

509
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,081
Honey, what are you doing?

510
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,962
I don't know if that's a good idea, Brad.

511
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,127
Dusty!

512
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,965
It's vibrating up into my shoulders.

513
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,922
Hey, it's okay, Brad.
Look, she's a lot of bike, man.

514
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,929
No, I'm good. Why don't you go
back in and take that shower,

515
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,331
so you can get a shirt on?

516
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,284
You got it.
Hey, you look good on that, man.

517
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,566
Remember, one down, four up.

518
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,449
Dusty, everyone knows it's one down...

519
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,930
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

520
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,764
Did Brad just die?

521
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,322
I think we all need to prepare ourselves
for that possibility, pumpkin. Okay?

522
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,641
Brad!

523
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,681
Brad!

524
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,929
Oh, my God.

525
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,081
Brad, are you all right?

526
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,807
No, I'm not all right.
I'm in the wall. I'm scared.

527
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,086
Honey.

528
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,043
Jeez, Brad, I thought you said
you could ride.

529
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,322
I can ride, okay.
Would you get a shirt on?

530
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,606
I think if you could ride,

531
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,409
you wouldn't be stuck
in a wall right now, Brad.

532
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,562
Yeah. I'm sorry to say it, but he's right.

533
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,766
You almost killed the kids!

534
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,484
Let's not beat up
on Brad here. Okay?

535
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,766
He was showboating
for the kids a little bit,

536
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,961
and things got out of hand.

537
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,202
Let's all just be grateful
nobody got hurt. Okay?

538
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,561
I got hurt!

539
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,364
Okay, kids, listen up.
This is a good lesson

540
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,211
on why you never wanna lie
about your ability to do things

541
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,209
you clearly can't do, okay?

542
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,649
I think my arm is stuck in the wall.

543
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,131
Brad, just stay still. I'll get you out.

544
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,202
No,no,no,no,no.
No, don't do anything.

545
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,647
And would you please
just go and get a shirt on?

546
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,404
Just calm down, all right?

547
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,202
Hey, I'm really sorry about
what happened to your car.

548
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,368
Yeah, and I'm sorry about
what happened to your bike.

549
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,442
No damage. Not a scratch.

550
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,563
- Not even one scratch?
- Unbelievable.

551
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,405
That's so good.

552
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,803
Let's keep it going! Inside the cones!

553
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,370
Just like ice cream!

554
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,806
Morning, Jerry.

555
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,962
Got to keep it inside the cones!

556
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,725
No, Daddy! You're supposed
to stay in the cones!

557
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,041
Whoa, whoa! Inside the cones!

558
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,930
Inside. Bring her in. That's better.

559
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,685
Let's keep those kids safe today, okay?
Thank you, Brad.

560
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,091
Sorry, Doris.

561
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,681
It's okay. This whole drop-off line thing

562
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,205
can be a bit overwhelming
if you're not used to it.

563
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,601
I landed a chopper in the
middle of a Cuban prison riot,

564
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,364
Brad, I think I'm good.

565
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,207
Bye, guys! I love you guys so much.
Have a great day, okay?

566
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,964
- Bye, Daddy!
- Make sure you do all your work.

567
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,445
Bye, guys. Have the best day.
I love you so...

568
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,200
Here's the exciting thing.

569
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,330
We just opened up in our 68th market,
making The Panda America's

570
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,607
number three smooth jazz station.

571
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,121
Wow.

572
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,282
And here it is. My little nook.

573
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,966
Wow. Man, I gotta admit,
this is more than I expected.

574
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,481
Wow.

575
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,880
I kind of envy you, Brad.

576
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,121
Stop it.

577
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,927
It's true. You're a nice guy,
making a comfortable living,

578
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,207
and the most fantastic woman
in the world loves you dearly.

579
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,725
Really? Thanks for saying that.

580
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,164
I mean it. And that sacrifice
she's making for you... That's true love.

581
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,361
Sacrifice?

582
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,567
Well, sure, Brad.

583
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,210
You know how bad
that girl wants another baby.

584
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,285
She wants another baby?

585
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,771
For her to let that slip away

586
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,730
and marry a man she knew to be barren,
that's true love.

587
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,484
How do you know that I can't...

588
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,761
- Bradley.
- Yes.

589
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,922
Caroline says we're gonna hear some
new voice talent this a.m.?

590
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,843
Yes, sir, in about 15 minutes.

591
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,924
Okay. How'd it go
with the shitbag ex-husband?

592
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,451
You whip his ass with
that Loving Fence of yours?

593
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,969
Well, actually it's interesting, Mr. Holt,

594
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,691
because I want you to
meet Dusty Mayron.

595
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,886
Jesus in the morning.
She was married to him first?

596
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,041
Okay. Let's establish some
ground rules, pretty boy.

597
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,246
Airborne?

598
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,011
Your lapel pin.
101st, that's one hell of a division, sir.

599
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,481
Well, thank you, Dusty.

600
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,681
Are you Airborne?

601
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,564
No, sir, I'm afraid
I don't share that honor,

602
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,927
but I'm humbled to be in the
presence of anyone who does.

603
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,526
Airborne Division?
Those guys love to fly.

604
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,840
Very nice to meet you, sir.

605
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,922
Thank you, thank you.
It's good to meet you.

606
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,047
My pleasure. It's an honor.

607
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,485
Fast friends over there.

608
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,891
That's wonderful.

609
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,366
Come on! No way!

610
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,882
The whole time you're running guns
for the freedom fighters

611
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,644
right under the cartel's noses,

612
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,529
and they never suspected
it was you once?

613
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,251
Well, I'm sure they started to suspect
once they were in a ball of fire

614
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,890
the size of four city blocks.

615
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,488
That's great. I love that!

616
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,050
Holy buckets, Brad!

617
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,010
If this guy was my wife's ex,
I'd put a bullet in my skull.

618
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,326
Come on, Leo, cut it out.

619
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,971
Sir, I think Barry's ready.

620
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,326
You're really going to like this guy.

621
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,641
Okay. Ready to listen.

622
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,411
<i>One-oh-three-point-six</i>

623
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,762
<i>The Panda!</i>

624
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,650
All right.

625
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,451
- You like him, Brad?
- I do.

626
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,084
I do. I think his voice
has a warm dependability

627
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,091
that all Panda listeners could trust.

628
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,807
What do you think, Duster?

629
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,969
Does Dusty now work for The Panda?

630
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,844
Yeah, Brad's right.

631
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,048
I'm not really into smooth jazz.
I shouldn't comment.

632
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,322
Nobody's into smooth jazz.

633
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,646
I'm into smooth jazz.

634
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,921
Of course you are, Brad.

635
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,606
So what do you think, Dusty?

636
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,524
I mean, it just seems a little flaccid.

637
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,886
I think you need a voice with

638
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,724
some virility and hope,
that tells listeners,

639
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,963
"Hey! Maybe the next song
won't suck as bad as the last one."

640
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,242
Also, I think a strong ability
to be something like...

641
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,290
<i>One-oh-three-point-six</i>

642
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,727
<i>The Panda!</i>

643
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,001
What...

644
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,482
What just happened?

645
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,801
He sang the tagline.

646
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,725
Good boy, Tumor!

647
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,811
Daddy!

648
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,041
Hey!

649
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,485
Perfect timing. Listen to this.

650
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,040
- Is that you?
- Yeah!

651
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,326
That's you?

652
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,810
Why is that him?

653
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,402
I took him to work, and 15 minutes later
he's the new voice of The Panda.

654
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,484
Hey, you believe that? I record
one take at 9:30 this morning,

655
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,971
it's already run 11 times.

656
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,082
Do I really get 182 bucks
every time they play that?

657
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,400
Yes. Every time, yes.

658
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,760
Money.

659
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,446
You see why I love America
even more than most people do?

660
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,365
Hey. What's this?

661
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,204
Just the handyman
I hired off Angie's List.

662
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,606
He's upstairs fixing the damage.

663
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,608
Your wife had to hire a man? For what?

664
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,170
Some framing, a little sheetrock repair,

665
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,526
some masonry
and basic window glazing?

666
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,369
Come on, Brad.
We can bang that out tonight.

667
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,687
Yeah.

668
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,002
It's just basic sheetrock glazing

669
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,686
and, you know, little whatamajigs.

670
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,690
Get up there and

671
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,689
get in there and crank it out.

672
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,200
Dusty is pretty good with his hands.

673
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,884
Pretty good with my hands,
Brad, she knows.

674
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,807
Okay. Yeah, I'll just go up there and I'll...

675
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,882
- Want me to do it? I'll tell him to screw.
- No, no, no, no.

676
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,121
No, no, no. That's okay.

677
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,281
I'll tell him,

678
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,805
-"Guess what, bub?"
- Tell him the men are here.

679
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,081
I'll say that. I'll say, "The men are here."

680
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,884
- Let's do it.
- I don't want to imply to him

681
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,889
that he's not a man. But I'll just say,

682
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,162
"Hey, the boys are back in town." Right?

683
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,881
Hi.

684
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,767
I'm Brad. My wife hired you.

685
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,001
Nice to meet you, Brad.

686
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,402
I just came up here to say that you...

687
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,731
That you should have good luck.

688
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,243
Thank you for your wishes of luck.

689
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,726
I'll be downstairs.

690
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,931
Well? What happened?

691
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,881
You know, I think it's...

692
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,328
He already started,
and I just think it feels wrong.

693
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,606
Why? Because he's black?

694
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,091
No. No, no.

695
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,771
Megan! Dylan!

696
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,484
- What are you doing?
- Teaching moment.

697
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,523
Guys, what would we call Brad
if he treated someone differently

698
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,409
just because of the color of their skin?

699
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,924
Brad's being racism?

700
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,082
Racist, honey. Brad is a racist.

701
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,924
- Honey.
- But not on purpose.

702
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,371
Is Brad a Klan person?

703
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,648
No.

704
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,451
So I'm a racist if I don't fire someone?

705
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,521
Well, yeah, you are.

706
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,681
Yeah, you are.

707
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,451
Sir, you're taking this all wrong.

708
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,324
Right. So you get one look
at the color of my skin,

709
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,209
and all of a sudden you're
Mr. Do It Yourself?

710
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,725
No, not at all. Please,

711
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,404
allow me to pay you
for your time and travel.

712
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,926
Don't do me any favors, Paula Deen.

713
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,807
I'm not a woman.

714
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,291
You did the right thing.

715
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,209
Boy, it doesn't feel that way.

716
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,646
Let's get cracking.
Where do you keep your tools?

717
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,041
I know where Brad keeps his tools.
In the credenza.

718
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,007
- Yeah.
- You keep your tools

719
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,570
-in the credenza, Brad?
- In the credenza.

720
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,846
Just easier to get to.

721
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,251
- It's convenient.
- Yeah.

722
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,324
This is a tackle box, Brad.
Are we going fishing?

723
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,402
No. Unless you want to go fishing.

724
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,563
What have you got in here?

725
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,927
A hammer, masking tape,
three C batteries and

726
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,001
a tampon.

727
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,121
Well, a tampon's handy for...

728
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,929
Yeah, I know what they're handy for.

729
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,091
So are we not going to fix it?

730
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,366
Well, what do you want from me, Brad?

731
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,646
To buy all the gear we need
would cost more

732
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,007
than just hiring someone
off of Angie's List.

733
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,011
And the King, he thought

734
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,890
the Step King seemed okay at first,
a little soft, maybe,

735
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,088
but, heck, the Queen
needed a meal ticket.

736
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,850
But the more the King
learned about him,

737
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,002
the more he doubted the
Step King's ability to lead.

738
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,931
So the King decided
there was only one way to...

739
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,365
Hey. Good story?

740
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,602
Yeah. The King finally
came back to his castle.

741
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,769
But the evil Step King
wouldn't give him his crown back.

742
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,365
Okay, yeah.
I think I've heard this story before.

743
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,044
It's a story as old as time, Brad.

744
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,811
You know what? It turns out
the Step King wasn't evil at all.

745
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,166
He was a really good guy.

746
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,322
Fun at parties, great conversationalist,

747
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,368
affable. And he saw

748
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,410
that the beautiful Queen
and perfect Prince and Princess

749
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,802
were all alone, and he came
valiantly to their rescue.

750
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,849
Yeah, but wasn't
the Queen sad because

751
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,048
the Step King couldn't give
her an heir to the throne?

752
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,531
Okay, you know what?
Now this is getting personal.

753
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,490
Hey, Brad, come on.
We're just doing fairy tales here.

754
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,403
All right. Well, the Queen wasn't sad,

755
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,321
just for the record.

756
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,606
The Step King was pretty sure
she was totally cool with it.

757
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,251
Yeah, Brad's right. I'm sure
the Queen was thrilled. Right?

758
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,881
Right?

759
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,561
Yeah.

760
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,321
Honey,

761
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,164
what's the matter?

762
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,888
Are you still sad about
Dusty finding your tampon?

763
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,042
No. No, I mean,

764
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,889
this is a little embarrassing,

765
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,849
but it's just, I was...

766
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,684
ls there any chance
you still want another baby?

767
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,682
Oh, my God.
What, did Dusty say something?

768
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,682
He's just trying to get in your head.

769
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,285
So it's not true then?

770
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,525
Okay. Maybe I did want another baby.

771
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,442
But it's not possible,
given what happened to your...

772
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,410
And I'm not blaming them. I love them.

773
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,210
They are my fuzzy little pals.

774
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,406
You don't have to say that.

775
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,726
They are.

776
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,124
I am 100% happy
with the family that I have.

777
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,450
The only reason I'm putting up with him

778
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,722
is because my kids
are so happy to see him.

779
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,962
And I want them to have
a relationship with their father.

780
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,881
You know what?

781
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,445
I can't wait to see his face

782
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,330
when he figures out
how much you really do for his kids.

783
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,407
Yeah. I mean, I'm

784
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,971
involved. I'm emotionally available.

785
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,166
Yeah, you are.

786
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,890
You are darn right.

787
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,086
It's high time Dusty sees
how a real dad does it.

788
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,084
I am fired up!

789
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,131
Let's get some shut-eye.

790
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,281
Hallelujah!

791
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,326
Hey, dudes! Hey, T.J.!

792
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,050
Brad! Look what Dad did!

793
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,521
He finished the treehouse for you!

794
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,490
Hey, hey! B-man!

795
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,330
No, watch out, B!

796
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,248
Hey, Brad. Sorry about that.
You all right?

797
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,921
What do you think, man?

798
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,650
Wow. Pretty cool zipline.

799
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,171
You like that? It's military grade.

800
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,090
You built all this today? With my tools?

801
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,925
No, you can't build a treehouse
with a tampon, Brad.

802
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,604
No, I had a little bit of help.

803
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,763
Yo, Dylan, PS4 is all hooked up.

804
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,769
- Thanks, Uncle Griff.
- No problem, buddy.

805
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,927
Uncle Griff?

806
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,730
Dude, I went out for a beer last night,

807
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,450
and who's tending bar
but our man Griffy?

808
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,522
We get to talking and we just click.
You know what I mean?

809
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,683
He's a great dude, man. He really is.

810
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,001
I know how you feel about him,
but just give him a chance.

811
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,088
All right? He's having
a tough time at home,

812
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,924
and your firing him sure didn't help.

813
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,565
I fired him because you made me!

814
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,721
- I made you?
- Yeah.

815
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,968
Am I in charge around here now?
ls my name on the mortgage?

816
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,525
Last time I checked,
you were the man of the house,

817
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,170
and me and Griffy
were just staying here.

818
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,969
- He's not staying here.
- Because he's black?

819
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,366
No, not because of that.

820
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,522
Look, Griffy helped me
knock this out, all right?

821
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,688
So despite any prejudices
that you may or may not have...

822
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,450
I don't have any prejudices.

823
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,726
I said "may or may not."

824
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,926
- Well, it's may not.
- Well, that's good.

825
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,650
Because that's one of the ones I said.

826
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,490
Hey, kids, come on.
Helmets on the half-pipe.

827
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,721
We got to be safe around here.

828
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,926
Half-pipe?

829
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,128
I know it's taking up a lot of
the yard, but it's gonna make

830
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,645
your house the coolest place
in the neighborhood.

831
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,285
I got a sound system, we got

832
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,050
a couple Go-Pros. That's Corey
from Red Bull over there.

833
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,485
Hey, Corey!

834
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,921
You got a sponsor for my backyard?

835
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,321
Hey, Mr. Mayron! You want next?

836
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,164
Nicholas, please, it's Dusty!

837
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,642
And, yes, I do. Brad, watch this run.

838
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,921
I'm gonna dedicate this run
to my future X-Games champs,

839
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,968
Dylan and Megan. This is for you!

840
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,643
Looks like you picked the
wrong leisure activity, buddy.

841
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,885
Thank you.

842
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,970
- Hey, Sara.
- Hi.

843
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,201
Okay. Who's got next?

844
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,685
Idol

845
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,725
Look!

846
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,527
Some cute little tricks there, Dusty.

847
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,561
Really adorable.

848
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,841
Brad?

849
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,371
Hey, who'd like to see
how we used to do it

850
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,727
back in the empty pools of Encino,

851
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,968
Castaic, Irvine, Long Beach?

852
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,885
Santa Clarita?

853
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,325
Santa Cruz?

854
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,881
Fremont?

855
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,163
Honey, no, please come down.

856
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,720
I intend to, sister.

857
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,161
Come on, Brad, it hasn't been that long.

858
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,401
Godspeed.

859
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,004
Oh, my God! Brad!

860
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,650
No, it's best not to touch him.
Wait a second.

861
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,290
What do you mean, don't touch him?
He's in trouble.

862
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,925
Look, I know he's in trouble, okay?

863
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,769
But if there's a problem, who
do you want to be in charge?

864
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,881
<i>You'?</i>

865
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,962
Okay. All right, guys,
we have an emergency situation.

866
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,281
And what's the first thing we do?
Anybody?

867
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,564
- You! Redhead.
- Call 911.

868
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,082
Close. But wrong.
First thing we do is remain calm.

869
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,207
That's good advice.

870
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,681
The 911 operator can't understand you
if you're hysterical, okay?

871
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,808
So let's all take a deep breath.
In for ten...

872
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,002
Are you kidding me right now?
Help him!

873
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,969
Hey, that doesn't sound calm, Sara.

874
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,929
Now, please, call 911
and relate to the dispatcher

875
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,843
-what happened calmly, okay?
- Okay, yes.

876
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,729
Anybody know what we do next?

877
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,040
Check for pulse!

878
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,043
Nice! My star pupil! Come on up here.

879
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,282
All right! Okay, two fingers on the neck,

880
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,686
right below the ear.

881
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,683
Good. You feel a heartbeat?

882
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,806
Okay, now that means that
Brad here is now clinically... Anybody?

883
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,365
- You, Jean Jacket!
- Dead?

884
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,885
Attaboy, Jean Jacket.
You're a smart kid.

885
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,007
He is dead.

886
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,686
So what do we do?
Come on, we're losing him here.

887
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,330
Give him C.P.R.?

888
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,921
Yes! That's my girl.
Come on up here, sweetie.

889
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,801
All right! All right, lock your fingers like
this and press down hard right here.

890
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,645
Great job, sweetheart.

891
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,767
Dusty, hurry!

892
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,569
Okay, I'm going to go ahead
and take this one.

893
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,000
Okay? Watch closely now.

894
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,963
If you do your
chest compressions properly,

895
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,327
it shouldn't take long. Clear out, guys.

896
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,005
I got him! I got him!

897
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,411
My dad can bring people
back from the dead!

898
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,888
Mr. Whitaker's a zombie!

899
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,366
Look, I'm okay, really.
I just got a little jolt.

900
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,841
You got a little killed
is what you got, Brad.

901
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,850
We thought we lost you.

902
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,565
Okay, I'm sorry.

903
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,682
I just got tired of being
the lame stepdad.

904
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,643
All the kids think he's Superman.

905
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,524
Well, now you know how I felt.

906
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,444
I always had to be the bad guy mom,

907
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,046
giving out the carrots
and the punishments,

908
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,891
and he would breeze in
from God only knows where

909
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,968
and get to be the cool, fun dad.

910
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,008
Honey. Look.

911
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,850
I'll talk to him, okay?

912
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,126
I'll tell him to get his stuff

913
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,407
and get over
to the Red Roof Inn. Pronto.

914
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,881
Great.

915
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,404
Wait. Prince Hans is
actually the bad guy?

916
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,125
Man, I didn't see that coming at all.

917
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,565
He seemed like he really loved Anna.

918
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,121
I hate Prince Hans.

919
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,446
Dusty.

920
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,489
Hey, how you feeling, Sparky?

921
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,684
Sparky. That's hilarious.

922
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,966
Brad, have you seen this movie?

923
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,320
It's unbelievable, man.

924
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,448
There's these two sisters,
one of them has ice powers.

925
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,449
Yeah, I'm familiar with Frozen.

926
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,089
Listen, Dusty, I need to talk to you now.

927
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,207
I can't talk now, Brad.

928
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,406
Just pause the movie!

929
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,845
Can you guys talk out there, please?

930
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,081
Griff, man. You gotta pause it, man.

931
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,480
No! I don't want to ruin the momentum.

932
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,769
He won't... Dude, if another song
comes on, you got to pause it. Okay?

933
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,251
Am I supposed to pause my emotions?

934
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,810
Just pause the song, man.

935
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,009
What's up? What's up?
What's going on, Brad?

936
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,445
- This shouldn't take long.
- Okay, good.

937
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,008
Listen, I just think that
you're being here...

938
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,969
Yeah. No problem.

939
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,485
...and now there's Griff here,

940
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,045
it's presenting some obstacles...

941
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,526
Stupid helmet!

942
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,886
Honey, what happened?

943
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,325
They pushed me off my bike again!

944
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,811
I'm so sick of it!

945
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,931
I want them dead, Brad.
I want their parents dead.

946
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,206
And if they don't have parents, I want

947
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,203
their primary caregivers dead.
Do you understand me?

948
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,361
- Okay, okay.
- He's okay.

949
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,091
Megan's upstairs playing with him.
I am so pissed about this.

950
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,286
Was it the fourth graders again?

951
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,681
Fourth graders?
What, you knew about this, Brad?

952
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,286
Yeah. Dylan asked to speak
specifically to me about it.

953
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,765
- Really?
- So, we role-played

954
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,285
some conflict resolution dialogue.

955
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,885
Are you being serious right now, Brad?

956
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,406
What you need to be teaching him
is some ass-beating resolution.

957
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,802
Damn straight. You got to
make a statement. Set a tone.

958
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,087
It's kind of
a family matter over here.

959
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,650
No, Dusty and Griff are right.

960
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,484
Those little punks need
their butts whooped.

961
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,891
You got any Miracle Whip?

962
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,007
Yeah, it's behind the...

963
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,681
Here. Hold on. Let me just get it for you.

964
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,484
Guys, I know we're upset right now,

965
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,569
but here's the thing.

966
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,770
Violence never solved anything.

967
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,967
Hey, check your history books, buddy.

968
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,371
Almost everything is solved by violence.

969
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,805
There are better ways.

970
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,491
Okay. Name one. Besides dialoguing.

971
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,170
- Name one?
- Name one!

972
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,244
- What do you mean, name one?
- You said you could

973
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,651
solve problems with
things other than fighting.

974
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,801
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

975
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,121
You said you knew!
You act like you knew!

976
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,281
- Fine, yes!
- What?

977
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,044
Dancing! Dancing.

978
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,361
Did you... Did you just
say dancing, Brad?

979
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,206
It's very popular in youth culture
to resolve conflict through dancing.

980
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,687
They step up to each other
and get served

981
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,207
by crunking, or popping and locking.

982
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,521
They call each other out,
they take turns,

983
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,401
and it is no less intense
than a classic street brawl.

984
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,729
But, at the end of the day, no one's hurt.

985
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,401
And it's a great aerobic workout.

986
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,770
He's flailing a bit,
but he has a good point.

987
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,087
There's a rich history
of dance battles in film.

988
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,368
<i>- You got Breakin' 1...</i>
- I <i>didn't even think of this.</i>

989
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,442
<i>...Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.</i>

990
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,289
One of the rare cases
where the sequel was better

991
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,646
-than the original.
- Much better.

992
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,563
<i>You got Step Up, Stomp the Yard.</i>

993
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,210
He makes a solid point.

994
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,171
Honey, are you telling us that we
should teach Dylan to dance?

995
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,322
No, I'm just saying

996
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,444
that teaching him to fight
isn't the answer.

997
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,922
Okay, but maybe teaching him
to fight back isn't so bad?

998
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,206
Okay.

999
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,126
There we go. Perfect.
That's good, right there.

1000
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,724
Yeah. A lot of protection.

1001
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,840
All right, Dylan. You ready, buddy?

1002
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,285
- I guess.
- You're ready.

1003
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,488
Brad, Griff. You guys be
the fourth graders.

1004
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,164
<i>- I'll</i> be Dylan.
- Okay.

1005
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,761
All right. Hey, buddy,
the first thing you want to do

1006
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,524
is call out the biggest one.

1007
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,524
Hey! What's the matter?

1008
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,846
You too much of a pussy to take me on

1009
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,524
without your little bitches
to back you up?

1010
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,681
Wow. Okay, yes.
That cut right through me, there.

1011
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,802
I'm filled with inner shame right now.

1012
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,321
Saying to myself,
"Gosh, maybe I'm not behaving

1013
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,483
"100% the way I want to."
Right? Is that same page?

1014
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,847
No. What the kid's gonna think
is, "Now I can beat your ass

1015
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,605
"all on my own." But now
you only got one bully to contend with.

1016
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,444
Now bullies always open up
with some shoving first.

1017
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,726
Watch. Brad, give me a little shove.

1018
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,686
I didn't connect there, did I?

1019
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,450
No. It was really close, though.

1020
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,406
See what I did, buddy?
I turned my bodyjust enough

1021
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,006
to let his weight bring him in,
then I came right down Broadway.

1022
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,161
I'm not gonna hit you.

1023
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,688
Okay, relax. Okay?

1024
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,486
It's called the element of surprise.

1025
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,965
Then you start punking his ass!

1026
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,162
You want some more of that, bitch?
You like that, bitch?

1027
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,009
All right. Do we really
need to use that word?

1028
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,206
- No.
- Honey, yes.

1029
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,845
Unfortunately, we do. I'm sorry.

1030
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,763
You have to make him a bitch.

1031
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,848
It's a fundamental step in
destroying a bully's psyche.

1032
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,331
Now stay down, bitch!

1033
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,890
Then you kick that kid
right in the nuts!

1034
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,007
Kick him in the nuts, Dylan!

1035
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,491
Wait! I thought you were in my gang.

1036
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,881
Yeah, but once Dylan tuned you up,
I switched sides.

1037
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,729
What do you think happens
out there on the playground, Brad?

1038
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,564
All right, now come on, buddy.
It's your turn. All right?

1039
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,966
I'll be the fourth grader.

1040
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,923
Can I just go inside already, please?

1041
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,968
Hey, buddy come on, this is easy.
You can do this.

1042
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,849
I said, no! I don't like this stuff.

1043
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,486
I'll just stay away from them
from now on. Mom?

1044
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,806
Okay, come here, buddy.

1045
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,041
- Come on. It's all right.
- Brad.

1046
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,685
Help me out here. Come on.

1047
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,401
Hey, wait.

1048
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,049
Pal, listen...

1049
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,163
I know what it's like
to be afraid to go to school.

1050
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,050
Okay? When I was your age,

1051
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,727
this group of older kids
started picking on me.

1052
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,762
I ran and I cried
underneath the bleachers.

1053
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,844
They bothered me every day,
because they knew

1054
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,931
I was too afraid to face them.

1055
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,768
Until one day, I'd had enough.

1056
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,202
And I socked Jesse Hubbard
right in the nose.

1057
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,522
Really? And they left you alone?

1058
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,251
Damn right they did.

1059
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,882
Brad. That was good.

1060
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,001
Come here, buddy.
Hey, I'm proud of you. All right?

1061
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,326
Now, look at me. I want you to

1062
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,731
punch them right
in the Adam's apple. Okay?

1063
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,689
I want you to shatter their throat.

1064
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,250
Hold on, hold on.

1065
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,126
I'm sorry. Look, I'm having
a pang of guilt right now.

1066
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,009
Full disclosure. Some of the elements

1067
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,411
of my story weren't exactly true.

1068
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,282
The incessant crying, 100% true.

1069
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,325
The constant bullying, absolutely,
it all happened,

1070
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,688
but I've never punched anyone
in my life.

1071
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,086
I could have told you that.

1072
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,727
- Then what did you do?
- Yeah, what did you do?

1073
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,482
Well, nothing at all.
In fact, sixth grade was so rough,

1074
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,244
I changed my name to

1075
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,126
Devin Lacecock.

1076
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,884
Why the hell would you tell him that?

1077
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,242
I pretended to be blind
for an entire school year,

1078
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,084
just to elicit empathy.

1079
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,244
Which was great until

1080
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,763
they found me intently watching
an episode of M*A*S*H.

1081
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,969
In fact, it got so bad,
my parents had to refinance

1082
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,610
our house to put me in private school.

1083
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,089
Let's just do that.
Can I go to private school, please?

1084
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,767
No, Dylan, we can't do that.
Want to know why?

1085
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,489
Because ever since that day,

1086
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,684
I've always run away from conflict.

1087
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,922
In fact, if I had a dad like Dusty
when I was your age, maybe

1088
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,880
he could have taught me
how to stand up for myself.

1089
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,602
So, wait. You're saying,

1090
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,961
if I don't stick up for myself now,

1091
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,447
I'll grow up to be a huge wussy like you?

1092
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,442
Yes. That is the basic
gist of what I'm saying. Yes.

1093
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,802
Okay. Then let's do this.

1094
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,770
Come on, buddy, you got this.

1095
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,921
Give me something. Come on.

1096
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,764
Faster, harder, meaner, stronger.

1097
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,080
You're fast, you're good.

1098
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,491
You're a winner. You're a champion.

1099
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,564
They got to let you off the leash, baby.
We got a little pit bull here.

1100
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,484
That was really nice,
you guys. Good job.

1101
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,722
It was really fun to watch the
two of you working together

1102
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,280
like a couple of great co-dads.

1103
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,761
Yeah.

1104
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,641
Co-dads. That's...

1105
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,446
That's good stuff.

1106
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,166
You know what?
In that same spirit of unity,

1107
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,531
I want to show my gratitude
for your inviting me

1108
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,369
to stay here
and share moments like these.

1109
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,608
About that, Dusty.
When I pulled you over there, actually...

1110
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,200
No, what you've done here
does not go unnoticed.

1111
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,691
And I repay my debts.

1112
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,724
Look, Sara, I know how much
you want another child.

1113
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,649
I think I can help
put a baby in there for you.

1114
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,404
- Oh, my God!
- What are you saying?

1115
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,687
- I mean I got a guy.
- Dusty, please! You got a guy?

1116
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,649
Yes, I got a guy. A fertility doctor.

1117
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,961
He's a buddy of mine.
I trained him for his first lronman.

1118
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,042
All right? Dr. Francisco is the real deal.

1119
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,362
- Dr. Emilio Francisco?
- You've heard of him?

1120
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,005
Oh, my God, yeah.

1121
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,049
He's been on Dr. Oz like 10 times.

1122
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,409
He's one of the top five reproductive
endocrinologists in the country.

1123
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,330
See? People wait years
to get an appointment with this guy.

1124
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,731
Do you really think he would see us?

1125
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,768
- Whoa, whoa, hold on.
- I know he would.

1126
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,411
If anybody can help you
have a baby, he can.

1127
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,245
Mommy's going to have a baby?

1128
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,606
Cool! Can we name it Griff?

1129
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,806
Thanks, D-man.

1130
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,042
Look, you guys,
I don't know if this is a good idea.

1131
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,964
You don't wanna name your baby
after a black person?

1132
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,166
- Is that it?
- No!

1133
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,730
You probably want to name it
something really white,

1134
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,529
like Connor or Gordon.

1135
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,921
Harland, or Scot with one T. Or Brad.

1136
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,651
No, no, Griff is a lovely name.
I'm just saying,

1137
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,208
I don't think it's a good
idea to get our hopes up,

1138
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,088
because, in the end,

1139
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,726
odds are, I'm going to let you down.

1140
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,811
Okay, honey, but what if

1141
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,690
I promise, promise, promise
not to get my hopes up?

1142
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,088
We could just try, right? It can't hurt.

1143
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,410
Okay, sure.
But you can't get your hopes up.

1144
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,721
No. I won't, I won't! Thank you!

1145
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,802
I feel like you've already
gotten your hopes up.

1146
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,530
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere!

1147
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,284
- You calling your mother?
- No!

1148
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,482
Okay, yes, but it's about something else.

1149
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,211
It's not about something else.

1150
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,404
Damn it, Brad, he set you up.

1151
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,009
He used this fancy doctor
to get your wife back on the baby train.

1152
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,245
When those test results come back
and prove you can't give her a baby,

1153
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,922
guess who's gonna be waiting
there cocked and loaded?

1154
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,362
Well, I trust my wife,

1155
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,762
so we really don't need to
keep talking about it, okay?

1156
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,604
Let me tell you a little story, Brad.

1157
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,124
When Jeneane, my fourth, and I
were returning from our honeymoon,

1158
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,248
she told me that
she had a 23-year-old kid.

1159
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,324
Brazilian boy.
Said she had him real young.

1160
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,726
So he moves in with us.

1161
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,451
Doesn't speak a lick of English.

1162
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,849
There are the usual tensions.
I try to assert my authority.

1163
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,731
"Andreas, get your feet off the furniture."

1164
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,764
"Andreas, you're too old
to sleep in bed with Mommy."

1165
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,811
"Andreas, you got to stay off the 'roids."

1166
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,566
And he'd get mad,
and hit me with a car antenna.

1167
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,804
Maybe that's the way kids are.

1168
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,490
No. Not really.

1169
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,040
So I adopt him,
help him get his citizenship.

1170
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,450
The second the papers come through,
guess what happens?

1171
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,607
I already know.

1172
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,682
They shack up together in Barstow.

1173
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,646
It turns out Andreas
is her boyfriend, Brad.

1174
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,684
I did not see it coming.

1175
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:08,169
I actually did, about one,
two words into your story.

1176
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,924
The moral of this fable is,

1177
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,604
it's good to know when you're beaten.

1178
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,686
- You know I think the world of you, Brad.
- Thank you.

1179
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,447
But if I'm being completely honest,
even I'm rooting for Dusty.

1180
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,565
He's just so damn likeable.

1181
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,967
You know, it's getting kind of late.
Shouldn't we just get back to work?

1182
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,725
Okay, you win.

1183
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,406
So where are we on The Panda Jam
numbers for next summer?

1184
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,047
London, you still on the conference call?

1185
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,691
Dusty Mayron, you crazy hijo <i>de puta!</i>

1186
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,488
Hey, what's up, Doc?

1187
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,131
You look great, man. You still
rocking those lronmans?

1188
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,282
Yeah, bro. I just finished Brazil in 11:40.

1189
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,124
- That's unbelievable.
- Yeah. Well, come on.

1190
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,406
Ain't nothing on you, man.

1191
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,524
Hey, my first race,
I'm limping across the finish line

1192
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,011
when this bastard laps me.

1193
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,565
I mean, come on, who wins an lronman,

1194
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,603
then decides to go around again?
Who does that?

1195
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,205
It sounds exhausting.

1196
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,802
Hey, I'm Dr. Francisco.
You must be Sara.

1197
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,961
Hi.

1198
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,243
Dusty, you were not lying
about this one. Very nice.

1199
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,126
And you weren't lying
about this one either.

1200
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,565
You must be Chief Glowing Sack.

1201
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,324
What?

1202
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,805
Hey, come on,
I'm just lighting you up, man.

1203
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,927
Come on, little hug.

1204
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,884
Okay, come on back, y'all.
Let's take a look.

1205
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,405
All right. So let's run it down.

1206
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,325
I think we can safely say

1207
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,402
your issue has nothing
to do with X-rays.

1208
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,206
You know what, sweetheart, come here.
Let's see that pretty little hand.

1209
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,930
Okay. Now put it right in here.

1210
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,485
Okay, you feel that?

1211
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,403
- Yeah.
- Okay, that is not how you want

1212
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,766
testicles to be shaped.

1213
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,924
Really? It feels like all the other...

1214
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,081
Hi.

1215
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,720
It cuts off blood flow, okay?
Limits potency.

1216
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,928
You want them to...
You know what? Actually...

1217
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,688
"Hey, Dusty!
- Hey.

1218
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,922
- Why is he coming in here?
- Little help in here, please.

1219
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,690
Come on. You gotta put me
through this every time?

1220
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,250
- Come on. Be a sport.
- All right.

1221
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,801
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

1222
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,445
Is this even ethical?

1223
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,121
James and the Giant Peach.

1224
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,762
- Did you just gulp?
- No.

1225
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,525
It's okay, I gulp every time.

1226
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,527
You see, this... This is what you want.

1227
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,285
Plump and bulbous.

1228
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,682
Glassy smooth, like

1229
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,206
two Patrick Stewarts,
you know what I mean?

1230
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,328
Don't embarrass me in front
of Sara like this anymore, okay?

1231
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,686
Hey, sorry, bro.

1232
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,286
So, ready to milk the cow,
see if we even got a sliver of hope here?

1233
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,806
Hey, Dusty, come on, buddy. Want to
try to break your own record?

1234
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,041
No, I'm good.

1235
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,730
Hey, come on, man.
I'm doing you a favor here.

1236
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,167
Give me something to brag
about at the next symposium.

1237
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,568
Fine. You want to break the record,
I gotta break the record.

1238
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,082
Yeah. Kid came to play.

1239
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,846
Should I grab a big cup, too?

1240
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,967
What? Stop screwing around.

1241
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,645
Come on. We're burning daylight here.

1242
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,043
Hello. Quick question.
How difficult would it be

1243
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,604
for someone to whip up
a batch of your Cinnabons?

1244
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,843
Would you need
restaurant-grade ovens?

1245
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,922
Bradsky. Could you
pass this along to Dusty?

1246
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,405
It's his first reside check.

1247
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,284
Disclaimer. It's more than you make.

1248
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,010
- Don't get worried about it.
- How much more than...

1249
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,044
And tell him, 8:30 sharp at my house.

1250
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,283
He doesn't need to bring anything.
All right, buddy?

1251
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,691
I've never been to your house.

1252
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,205
No, you haven't.

1253
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,888
Oh, my God, my hair, it looks awful.

1254
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,531
Doesn't Mommy's hair look pretty?

1255
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,364
- No. Next slide, please.
- Okay.

1256
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,286
Slides. Fun.

1257
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,370
Cool. You guys climbed that?

1258
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,285
Yuck. Why are you guys kissing
in every single picture?

1259
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,568
Mommy used to kiss Daddy a lot.

1260
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,370
Married people kiss a lot.

1261
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,646
Ready?

1262
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,051
Wow, China.

1263
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,890
I loved it there.

1264
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,281
Dylan, you were created right
there on that wall, buddy.

1265
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,050
- Really?
- Dusty, that's enough.

1266
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,884
Okay, next slide.

1267
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,644
That's where your mom and I met,
doing The <i>King</i> and <i>I</i> in summer stock.

1268
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,891
God, that costume was so tight.

1269
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,243
Next slide, please.

1270
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,005
Oh, my God.

1271
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,764
Is that baby me?

1272
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,402
All right, you guys,
let's get ready for bed.

1273
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,968
- Okay?
-It's story time, Mayron family!

1274
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,445
We don't have to wait
for Mr. Whitaker, do we?

1275
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,004
I really don't like you,
but that shit is heartbreaking.

1276
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,442
Griff's home!

1277
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,325
So the King raised his mighty sword

1278
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,607
and rained steel
down upon the Step King.

1279
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,204
But the Step King
blocked it with his shield.

1280
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,885
And swung his cat o'nine tails
into the King's smug face.

1281
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,611
Which the King easily brushed aside
like the feather of a gull.

1282
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,365
And then the King did counter
with a barrage of slashes

1283
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,808
and thrusts so fast and precise
the Step King had no way to parry.

1284
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,361
But he did. He did.
He parried all of them.

1285
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,044
Easily. It was no big deal.

1286
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,645
Then he grabbed the King's
sword right out of his hand

1287
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,964
and smashed it over his knee.

1288
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,844
That's when the King pulled out
a pump-action Mossberg shotgun!

1289
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,843
Which is completely anachronistic.

1290
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,402
So if we're doing any time period,
then the Step King just happened to be

1291
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,323
wearing Kevlar body armor.

1292
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,244
- Concussion grenade!
- Hand grenade.

1293
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,811
- Rocket launcher.
- Missile launcher.

1294
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,086
- Air strike.
- Nuclear strike.

1295
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,605
- Black hole.
- God.

1296
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,331
We know what this comes down to.

1297
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,086
The Step King was very upset

1298
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,083
because when the real King
pulled out his sword,

1299
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,243
it was long and shiny,

1300
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,402
and the Step King
did shudder at the size of it.

1301
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,166
And while the Step King acknowledged
that the King carried a mighty,

1302
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,844
beautifully engraved broadsword,

1303
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,288
all the maidens in the land

1304
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,806
preferred the more average-sized

1305
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,689
Step King's sword because

1306
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,365
it knew how to listen.

1307
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,844
And the King needs to realize
he's a guest in his castle

1308
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,128
and he better mind his P's and Q's

1309
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,288
because the Step King
has had it up to here

1310
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,771
with the King's bullshit!

1311
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,286
Brad said a naughty word.

1312
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,126
Kids, I'm so sorry you had to hear
that inappropriate language.

1313
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,361
Make sure you tell your mother.

1314
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,124
Brad, can I talk to you
in the hall, please?

1315
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,251
Brad, what just
happened in there, man?

1316
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:34,206
Look, the Step King should not have
used inappropriate language

1317
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,647
in front of the Prince and Princess,
he admits that.

1318
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,721
Why are you still saying it
like that, Brad?

1319
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,887
We're out in the hall.

1320
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,042
I don't know. I'm upset.

1321
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,566
Hold on.

1322
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,326
Hello?

1323
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,723
Yeah, Brad's here, he's doing good.

1324
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,200
Hey, it's Dr. Francisco.

1325
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,805
He wants us all to come in tomorrow.
9:30 work for you?

1326
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,881
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Yeah,

1327
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,247
we'll see you then.
All right, bud. Come on, man.

1328
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,803
The doctor will be with you in a moment.

1329
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,245
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1330
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,241
Hey, Brad,

1331
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,571
whatever happens here,
I just want you to know

1332
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,569
that I'm proud of you for doing your best.

1333
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:08,801
- Okay?
- Thank you.

1334
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,561
Hello, hello. Okay.
I'm going to cut right to the chase.

1335
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,411
Sara, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

1336
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,927
Oh, God. That is
a tough break. I'm sorry.

1337
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,241
Damn, that is a real shame.
My heart is melting.

1338
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,004
Yeah, it's a real shame, Sara.

1339
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,525
A real shame that
you're gonna have to put up

1340
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,011
with Brad here pounding away on you

1341
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,244
over and over,
now that he's got a fighting chance

1342
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,685
of getting you pregnant.

1343
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,161
What? Oh, my God!

1344
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,447
- Holy moly!
- Oh, my God.

1345
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,401
Hey, Doc, Doc, don't give them
a false sense of hope.

1346
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,569
Remember what you said about
the blood flow and the screwy 'nads?

1347
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,847
Yeah, well, Brad has you
to thank for that, Dusty.

1348
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,366
In lab rats,
whenever another alpha male

1349
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,204
comes around,
it can spike testosterone,

1350
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,566
driving up sperm counts.

1351
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,325
Now, no guarantees, okay?
But with my help, Brad,

1352
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,131
I think you got enough left in the tank
to make it all the way to baby town.

1353
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,361
That's so wonderful. Thank you.

1354
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,966
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

1355
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,963
- Can we give you a hug?
- Yeah. Come on in.

1356
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,610
Oh, my gosh.

1357
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,009
Did not expect this.

1358
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,482
You virile sea snake, you.

1359
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,807
- I underestimated you, Brad.
- Yes, you did.

1360
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,722
I can finally give Sara everything,
and it feels good.

1361
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,161
Now, listen, this is what you need to do.

1362
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,323
You need to go and pee outside
the room that Dusty sleeps in.

1363
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,920
He's gonna smell your urine
and know that

1364
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,446
your virility is not to be taken lightly.

1365
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,801
It's good advice.
I did it last year in the lobby.

1366
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,088
I remember. It was a health hazard.

1367
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,241
It scared the FedEx guy.

1368
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,687
No, I'm going to take
the high road on this one.

1369
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,245
Okay, fine, take the high road.

1370
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,051
But jam a baby up in there
as quickly <i>as</i> you can, Brad.

1371
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,926
Because, in the end, if Sara
does choose Dusty over you,

1372
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,651
he has to be stepdad to your baby.

1373
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,926
How beautiful is that?

1374
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,286
Come on, five it.

1375
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,931
No. You know, it feels strange

1376
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,482
to high-five over the custody
of my unborn child.

1377
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,641
I've been on Dusty's team.

1378
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,291
I'm trying to jump over
to the winning team Brad.

1379
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,249
- Get on this.
- I'd really rather not.

1380
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,125
I'm trying to share a moment
with you here. Please five me.

1381
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,368
It feels... No, thanks.

1382
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,086
- Got it!
- Wait. No.

1383
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,446
- Sweet.
-It didn't count.

1384
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,601
I love you, Brad.

1385
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,960
It's not a binding high-five.

1386
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,405
Fat beans in there.

1387
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,890
- Dusty?
- Brad.

1388
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,765
What can I do for you?

1389
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,606
Wow, that's some
impressive up-downs.

1390
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,251
Look,

1391
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,886
what you did for Sara and me,

1392
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,605
that's a life-changer, and

1393
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,089
I just wanted to say thank you.

1394
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,090
And I'm sorry.

1395
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,731
Sorry for what?

1396
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,282
Well, here's the thing.

1397
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,565
I mean, you show up,

1398
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,286
here's this guy who's cool and exciting.

1399
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:01,640
I guess I felt a little competitive, and
slightly insecure, and I start thinking,

1400
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,286
well, maybe you want to challenge me.

1401
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,007
But today you proved that
all you really care about

1402
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,491
is our family's happiness.

1403
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,726
Oh, man.

1404
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,291
I'm humbled.

1405
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,129
I mean it. And you know what?

1406
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,080
You're right.
I was challenging you, Brad.

1407
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,805
- Yeah?
- The truth?

1408
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,529
I see this new man in my kids' life.

1409
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,490
He's kind and caring and successful,
and I don't even want to like you.

1410
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,561
But I can't help it. I like you, Brad.

1411
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,161
Really?

1412
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,641
I was determined to push you out
and get my family back.

1413
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,366
I was underhanded and
disingenuous about it.

1414
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,930
I feel like a monster.

1415
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,923
No. No, no, no.

1416
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,968
At the risk of being disrespectful,
I want you to shut your mouth.

1417
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,569
You are allowed
to have those feelings. Okay?

1418
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,811
Heck, we're talking about
your own children here, for cripes' sake.

1419
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,400
Clean slate?

1420
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,131
Absolutely.

1421
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,961
Come here.

1422
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,128
You know what's funny?
You're not even sweating,

1423
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,243
after doing all those push-ups.

1424
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,646
That's exemplary.

1425
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,080
Thank you, Dusty.

1426
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,161
Thank you, Brad.

1427
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,449
All that stuff about pushing me out
and taking over my family,

1428
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,090
I mean, we're through all that, right?

1429
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,403
No, no, no. I'm here to defeat you

1430
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,289
and take back my family.
That can't change.

1431
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,045
But now I'll follow your noble example
and do it above board.

1432
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,125
Honestly. Like a man. Like you.

1433
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,643
But we just hugged.
You said you like me.

1434
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,571
I do like you, Brad, very much.

1435
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,880
It doesn't make this any easier.

1436
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,726
You know I'm gonna have to tell Sara
what you said in here today.

1437
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,047
Of course.
It would be irresponsible not to.

1438
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,964
She's not gonna like it.
She's gonna want you out.

1439
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,326
You're right about that, Brad.

1440
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,765
What the hell are you up to?

1441
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,365
I just told you what I'm up to.

1442
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,562
My head is spinning right now.

1443
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,241
Hey, you got any sweet potatoes?
Or yams?

1444
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,646
Sweet potatoes or yams?

1445
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,166
Griff, you know we have yams, all right?

1446
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,969
You made me buy them for you.

1447
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,769
I wanted to respect
your house by asking you

1448
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,201
before I got them.
I didn't want to just go grab yams.

1449
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,169
Okay, I appreciate that.
I'm dealing with something.

1450
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,481
- Just go get the yams.
- All right.

1451
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,483
Here's the thing. You're right, Dusty.

1452
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,762
Yeah. I'm not going to tell Sara.

1453
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,929
But I'm gonna prove to you
that I'm the best.

1454
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,204
You can eat my dust, Dusty.

1455
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,442
Christmas already?
Why didn't anybody tell me?

1456
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,329
It's not. It's the middle of April.

1457
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,891
Daddy must have done this!

1458
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,765
No, he didn't.

1459
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,610
Brad.

1460
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,521
Claus is the name.
Santa Claus, if you please.

1461
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,369
But this Brad you speak of

1462
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,329
called me all the way up
at the North Pole.

1463
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,085
He said his children
were so sad because

1464
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,806
their biological father
had missed so many

1465
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,161
Christmases and birthdays

1466
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,005
and special family holidays,
so he asked me

1467
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,731
to come here today so that Dusty

1468
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,928
could experience one Christmas

1469
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,889
with his kids before he leaves again.

1470
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,925
Probably for a long, long time.

1471
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,485
Can we open presents?

1472
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,643
You sure can, little girl.

1473
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,125
I think they're from Brad.

1474
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,283
In fact, all the presents are from Brad.

1475
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,166
Let's see if any of the
presents are from Dusty.

1476
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,449
Nope. Not one present from Dusty.
All from Brad.

1477
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,444
Hey, kids, let's not forget
who got you a dog. Remember?

1478
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,363
Hey, Tumor, quit humping Mrs. Claus!

1479
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,042
Okay, I am officially worried about you.

1480
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,407
Don't worry, Claus hasn't forgotten you.

1481
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,650
- For me?
- Yeah.

1482
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:53,442
Oh, my God, honey, it's beautiful.
I love it.

1483
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,968
Wait, no! No! No, no. It's too much.

1484
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:03,048
No, it looks like Tumor's
given away Megan's big gift.

1485
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,884
A Dorly! A pony! A pony!

1486
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,570
I know, it's a pony!

1487
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,810
It's a pony, Dusty! A pony!

1488
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,245
Can we name her Princess Elsa?

1489
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,961
You can name him whatever you want,
because it's yours!

1490
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,840
Brad, how can we afford a pony?

1491
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,206
Where are we even
going to put that thing?

1492
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,601
I can clear out some stable
space in the garage.

1493
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,205
Look, it's only half a horse.

1494
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,844
Okay? Think of it like
a big dog, only a lot better.

1495
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,368
What's this? What the heck?

1496
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,848
It's tickets to tonight's
NBA playoff game...

1497
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,729
- What?
-...against Dylan's favorite team,

1498
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,165
the Los Angeles Lakers?

1499
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,368
Thanks, Brad! You're the coolest!

1500
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,050
I love you, Brad!

1501
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,691
Not bad.

1502
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,600
Not bad at all.

1503
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,921
Merry Christmas, Whitaker family!

1504
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,366
Christmas?

1505
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,890
How long was I asleep for?

1506
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,090
- You guys got enough candy?
- Yeah!

1507
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,367
Remember, you can have anything
you want, 'cause it's Christmas!

1508
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,442
No, it isn't. It's not Christmas, kids.

1509
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,484
- All right. Here we are.
- Sick! We're this close?

1510
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,404
Yeah. Pretty good, right?
Megan, you sit down right there.

1511
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,403
Perfect. Dylan, you sit next to me.

1512
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,171
And, Dusty, I'm so sorry. Yeah.

1513
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,328
I could only get four in a row.
I couldn't get five.

1514
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,129
So you're across the aisle,
next to that gentleman.

1515
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,371
All right, guys, I'll be right here.

1516
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,050
- We can still chat.
- Bye, Daddy.

1517
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,047
Look, there's Kobe! It's him!
He's right there.

1518
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,283
Thank you, Brad, this is the best present
I've ever gotten.

1519
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,323
- You are so welcome.
- In my whole life.

1520
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,767
I'm glad to hear it's the
best present you've ever got!

1521
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,531
How much did these seats cost?

1522
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:48,886
Not too much.

1523
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,564
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give a big welcome</i>

1524
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,768
<i>to all the kids from Hearts of Courage.</i>

1525
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,607
Whoo! Hearts of Courage kids!

1526
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,762
Proud of you, you're all miracles!

1527
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,886
I love kids!

1528
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,405
All right, honey. That's plenty.

1529
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,482
I just get excited
when I'm with my family!

1530
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,167
Dusty! Dusty Mayron!

1531
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,483
Marco? Hey!

1532
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,250
What's up, man?
Are you coaching now?

1533
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,606
Yeah, I'm the new strength
and conditioning coach.

1534
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,727
- Man.
- Check you out.

1535
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,171
Hey, I played ball with him in Italy.

1536
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,163
This is my family. My little guy, Dylan.

1537
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,930
He's the biggest Kobe fan in the world.

1538
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,968
Really? Come on down.
I'll introduce you.

1539
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,525
- What?
- What? You hear that?

1540
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,687
You want to meet Kobe?

1541
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,807
Bring the whole family down.

1542
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,291
You guys can sit with the team.

1543
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,407
Hey, this is my little girl, Megan.

1544
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,124
She just invited me to her first
Daddy-Daughter Dance.

1545
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,965
- So sweet.
-What did he just say?

1546
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,084
What the hell did he just say?

1547
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,811
Sorry. He's okay.

1548
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,689
No, I'm not okay. He's not okay.

1549
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,808
- Honey, you need to calm down.
- No! I'm not gonna calm down.

1550
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,086
She asked me first!

1551
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,407
And now she's asking him?
No. It's not fair.

1552
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,881
Actually, it's very fair.
Okay? She has two dads.

1553
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,042
She wants you both there.
You just have to accept that.

1554
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,401
No, I'm not going to accept it. All right?

1555
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,801
I do pick-up! I do drop-off!

1556
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,610
Okay, I volunteer at school!

1557
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,728
I listen to the tantrums and the crying

1558
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,367
and the soundtrack of Frozen
that's on a goddamn loop all the time!

1559
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,727
And he just waltzes in for a few days,
and now he gets to go as well? No!

1560
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,605
No, she's got to choose.
It's either me or him!

1561
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,250
Megan, you got to choose!

1562
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,601
- You got to choose!
- Hey!

1563
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,091
It's the biggest decision of your life!

1564
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,161
Hey!

1565
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,606
You know what? I'm going to pretend
you're not acting like a crazy person,

1566
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,409
because I know you're very upset.

1567
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,281
But you need to get over yourself. Okay?

1568
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,488
Now go down there and
be happy with your kids.

1569
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:27,201
No! A scalper gouged me 18 grand
for these seats. I'm not leaving them!

1570
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,046
What?

1571
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,241
What did you just say?

1572
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,443
Yeah. Nothing. Let's just... You're right.

1573
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,447
I'm so much more relaxed now.
Thank you.

1574
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,331
Yeah. Let's just go down... Let's just...

1575
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,401
No!

1576
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,410
I think you should sit
in your $18,000 seats,

1577
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,888
and think of all the better ways
your family could have used that money.

1578
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,761
Sara.

1579
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,685
The guy from the nuclear sub thing?

1580
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,683
- Mayron! That's him.
- That's the guy?

1581
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,889
Can I get some beers down here?
Can I get five beers?

1582
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,410
Excuse me, some beers!

1583
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,964
<i>What's up, everybody?</i>

1584
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,290
<i>Let's make some noise!</i>

1585
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,328
<i>Tonight, one lucky fan is going to</i>

1586
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,926
<i>get a chance to shoot from half court</i>

1587
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,727
<i>to win a family vacation
to Disney World!</i>

1588
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,642
<i>And our lucky fan is sitting in</i>

1589
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,961
<i>section 113,</i>

1590
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,890
<i>row 6,</i>

1591
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,727
<i>C-1. Where is he?
Let's see it. Where is he?</i>

1592
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,404
It's me. It's me, I win!

1593
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,845
- There he is.
- I win.

1594
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,651
I'm-a make it to Disneyland.
I'm-a make it all right.

1595
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,085
- All right, Brad!
- Yay, Brad!

1596
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,286
Yay, Brad!

1597
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,524
<i>AH right, sir, how you doing?
What's your name?</i>

1598
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,161
<i>First off, I love my kids.</i>

1599
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,164
<i>He loves his kids! Let's give it up!</i>

1600
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:31,002
<i>And if anyone was ever
to do anything to them,</i>

1601
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,402
<i>- I would hurt them.
-Okay.</i>

1602
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,842
<i>I would freakin' hurt them!</i>

1603
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,691
<i>Okay-</i>

1604
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,327
<i>This guy over here
is trying to take them!</i>

1605
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,204
<i>Trying to steal my family.</i>

1606
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,204
<i>He doesn't sweat!</i>

1607
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,451
<i>Okay, you know what?
Why don't we just shoot...</i>

1608
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,363
<i>But I got news for you, buddy!</i>

1609
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,291
<i>Last night, while you were sleeping,</i>

1610
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,010
<i>I made love to our wife!</i>

1611
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,685
<i>- Okay_
'My wife!</i>

1612
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,567
<i>Sara, right over there!</i>

1613
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,009
<i>Took my Wiener out of my pants!</i>

1614
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,969
This is a family event, okay?

1615
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,724
- Boo! Boo!
- All right.

1616
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,041
<i>So,</i>

1617
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,723
<i>even if Sara does pick you,
you're going to have to be</i>

1618
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,002
<i>the stepdad to my kid!</i>

1619
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,766
<i>You see how you like it! Okay?</i>

1620
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,446
<i>Let's get somebody else down here,
all right? Somebody else...</i>

1621
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,329
<i>Somebody else is going to win
a family trip!</i>

1622
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,731
Give me that ball, you.

1623
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,203
<i>This one's for Dylan and Megan
and Sara and Dylan.</i>

1624
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,245
<i>Nothing but net.</i>

1625
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,767
<i>AH right, he's going for it!
Nothing but net!</i>

1626
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,081
Do-over!

1627
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,890
- That's a do-over!
- No do-over. No.

1628
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,291
It's a do-over!

1629
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:08,048
<i>I'm so sorry you had to see that.
I'm so sorry.</i>

1630
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,327
Hey, kids, why don't you go inside
and put on your pajamas?

1631
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,446
- What are you doing?
- I'm comforting you.

1632
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,088
Sara, look... Sorry, too soon. I know.

1633
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,162
But I just want you to know
that I'm here for you and the kids.

1634
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,331
Really? You want to be
a real parent now? Is that what this is?

1635
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,606
Absolutely. I'm here now.

1636
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,728
Dusty, I'm working
crazy hours this week.

1637
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,201
With Brad gone, the kids
are gonna have to be dropped off,

1638
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,209
picked up, taken to swimming lessons.

1639
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,886
Dylan has a play date
with Eli on Tuesday,

1640
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,361
and Megan has a dentist
appointment on Friday.

1641
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,801
Sara, I know in the past
I've been unreliable,

1642
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,447
but this is a new me. All right?
This is the new Dusty.

1643
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,000
Well, you can't take them
to school on a motorcycle.

1644
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,491
- You need a car.
- Done.

1645
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,886
Okay.

1646
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,364
Hey! You're not staying here!

1647
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,851
Are you sure you don't need
company right now?

1648
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,285
I mean, you're going through
a tough transition here.

1649
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,850
Be here at 6:30
tomorrow morning.

1650
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,325
Can I at least come in and get my stuff?

1651
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,447
No!

1652
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,166
I'm gonna wait for a while,
in case you change your mind.

1653
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,006
Hey-

1654
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,444
What did you throw Griff out for?

1655
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,844
This place is chaotic.

1656
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,964
There's always some bullshit
going on in that house.

1657
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,088
God, man.
Want to go to the Red Roof Inn?

1658
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,247
Let's do it.

1659
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,686
Is that Cinnamon Toast Crunch?

1660
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,091
Yes, sir.

1661
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,130
Okay. No running!

1662
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,567
All right. Lindsey! Sloane!
Car's open right down there!

1663
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,480
Okay, sir, inside the cones!
Just like ice cream!

1664
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,766
Keep it inside...

1665
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,365
That's right! Thank you.

1666
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,329
Hi. I see you've been picking up
Megan and Dylan these past few days.

1667
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,890
Should I expect you from now on?

1668
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,327
I'm their real dad, so yeah, from now on.

1669
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,209
Terrific. I see that you also

1670
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,362
haven't signed up to
volunteer in the lane.

1671
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,091
Brad was so good about
helping us out in the lane,

1672
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,924
in the classroom, PTA, and so forth.

1673
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,321
We could always count on him
for bake sales, Spring Sing,

1674
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,402
costumes for Winter Pageant.
You know the drill.

1675
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,409
I hope I can count on you
to be the new Brad.

1676
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,604
Sure, yeah. You can count on me.

1677
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,371
I mean, I'm their real dad,
so, yeah, I'll be here every day.

1678
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,205
Great. So, if your kids aren't out here,
I'm gonna need you to circle around

1679
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,367
to the back of the line. Okay?

1680
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,363
- No, I can't go around.
- Thanks.

1681
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,805
I came ten minutes early
so I don't have to...

1682
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,928
If your kids aren't here,
you have to go around!

1683
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,849
I know. There's somebody
in front of me. Okay?

1684
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:23,921
Just go around!

1685
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,202
I can't just go over the
cones! I'm boxed in here!

1686
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,964
- Go around!
- No, you can't! Okay?

1687
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,531
She said stay in the cone,
like ice cream!

1688
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,170
Go around!

1689
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,441
Inside the cones!

1690
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,131
Amanda has got a recital!

1691
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,811
I have to get there! You need to go!

1692
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,367
Hey!

1693
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,886
We always stay inside the cones!

1694
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,645
Cones!

1695
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,049
Cones! Come on!

1696
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,770
Have you been living here
for the last few days, Brad?

1697
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,961
No.

1698
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:06,169
Then what's with the blankets
and the hot plate

1699
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:07,926
and the B.O.?

1700
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,211
I crapped in the wastebasket.

1701
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,641
You know, Brad, two years
into my thing with Charlene,

1702
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,844
her first husband showed up.
Oriental fellow.

1703
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,010
You can't say that.
You cannot say "Oriental."

1704
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:26,125
His name was Yu or Wu.
It could have been Javier.

1705
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,848
Anyway, I get off early one day,
get home, and

1706
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,202
there he is, stark naked in our bed.

1707
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,726
I didn't know what to think.

1708
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,485
Really? You didn't know what to think?

1709
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,002
Six months later,
I wake up in a Chinese prison

1710
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,567
with a tattoo on my lower back

1711
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,842
of a golf ball rolling
towards my butthole.

1712
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,128
I can't hear these stories anymore.

1713
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,168
I'm sorry. I know they're
supposed to help...

1714
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,362
Griff! What are you doing here?

1715
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,808
Thought you should know
Dusty came by the bar earlier.

1716
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,123
He was talking about how
he can't do the daddy thing.

1717
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,611
I tried to talk some sense into him,

1718
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,444
but he seemed determined
to get out of town.

1719
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,521
What, he's leaving?

1720
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,450
I don't think I have to tell you,
but little Megan's dance is tonight,

1721
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,160
and she's not going to have a daddy.

1722
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:08,050
That's fantastic. Brad, you win.

1723
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,647
And Dusty, because of
an act of cowardice, loses.

1724
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,883
I mean, you're the daddy again.

1725
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,884
Come on, hit that.

1726
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,005
No, I'm not her daddy.

1727
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,246
I wish more than anything I was,

1728
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,567
but I'm not.

1729
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:33,243
Yeah, you're right, Brad. A real dad
wouldn't give up on his kids so easy.

1730
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,561
Griff!

1731
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,603
Wait!

1732
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,410
He's still in the room, Brad.

1733
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,250
Hey-

1734
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,927
Sorry. I thought you stormed out.

1735
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:55,881
What you said sounded like a storm-out,
and then I heard the door close.

1736
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,844
I just thought that shit
was getting kind of personal,

1737
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,604
so it'd be good to close the door.

1738
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,248
So extremely thoughtful.
Thank you. Yeah.

1739
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,922
And just so you know
where my head was at,

1740
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,367
I was going to chase you
down the hallway. Right?

1741
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,844
You'd hear my footsteps and you're like,
"ls someone after... What's going on?"

1742
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:17,130
It's me, and I'm like, "Griff, hey!

1743
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,726
"You were right."

1744
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,282
Holy shit! That would be so uplifting.

1745
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,441
Can we do that?

1746
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,681
Griff, can you storm out, and Brad,
you go after him?

1747
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,683
I don't really want any part of that.

1748
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,201
That sounds like pure nonsense to me.

1749
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,567
I don't want... I'd rather not.

1750
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,166
We could just try it.

1751
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:41,121
No, that sounds forced
and weird to try to

1752
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:44,051
recreate something.
Not even recreate.

1753
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,122
It would be creating. It didn't happen.

1754
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,164
It's over-discussed at this point.

1755
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,407
Shouldn't you go see your kid?

1756
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,970
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right.

1757
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,805
You guys go. Brad, can I come?

1758
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:53,921
No.

1759
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,163
Daddy's not coming, is he?

1760
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:13,006
Honey, he'll be here. He promised.

1761
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,648
I see cupcakes over there.

1762
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,966
I think you should go eat some. Go on.

1763
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,525
Go eat a lot of sugar.

1764
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:38,961
Dusty.

1765
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,361
- Nope.
- Come on, Dusty.

1766
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,761
Where are you going?

1767
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,167
I'd pay a billion dollars
to take her to that dance.

1768
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,049
- You're just gonna leave?
- You take her then.

1769
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,447
I can't take her. Okay?
I'm not welcome after I said

1770
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,124
I was gonna put a spite baby
in her mother.

1771
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,123
- I guess that's out, then.
- Yeah, that is out.

1772
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,486
So it's gotta be you.

1773
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:59,250
I'm sorry, Brad,
I just can't do it, all right?

1774
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,765
What do you mean, you can't do it?

1775
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,683
I can't stay inside the cones.

1776
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,842
Look, Dusty, the cones are
there for everyone's safety.

1777
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,605
- It's not about the cones.
- You just said it was.

1778
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,125
The cones are a metaphor, Brad.

1779
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,322
I'm not the domestic type, okay?

1780
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,245
Dusty, come on.
What are you talking about?

1781
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,561
You're organized, you're handy.

1782
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:18,007
You make the best cinnamon rolls
I have ever tasted.

1783
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,320
Those were Cinnabons, Brad. Come on.

1784
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,289
You can't make rolls like that
in a conventional oven.

1785
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,728
I knew it! I knew it.
I knew it from the beginning!

1786
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,651
So you've been telling
some tall tales, huh?

1787
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:29,041
- All that Special Ops stuff.
- No, just the Cinnabons!

1788
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,770
Why would you lie about Cinnabons?

1789
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,683
'Cause I wanted to win. All right?

1790
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,842
I wanted to prove that
I was a good dad, too, but I'm not.

1791
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,401
Okay? Are you happy?
Is that what you want to hear?

1792
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,761
All the noise and the mess
and all the choices.

1793
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,330
You do one thing wrong,
you can screw them up for life.

1794
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,171
- Do you realize that?
- Yeah.

1795
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,965
Dads have to make
a lot of choices, okay?

1796
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,246
And we blow most of them.

1797
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,521
Yeah, and the other parents.

1798
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,524
That kid, Eli. I was over there
for a play date. You know about this?

1799
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,364
You can't just ride your bike
over to a friend's house,

1800
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,441
to play Hot Wheels anymore,

1801
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,851
now you got to make some kind of date?

1802
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,331
- I know, it's a shame.
- Well, I'm over there,

1803
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,488
and the kid's dad keeps
asking me if Dylan's gonna be

1804
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,721
in the gifted program with Eli.

1805
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,768
Like Dylan isn't as smart as
his little ball-scratcher kid.

1806
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,604
I wanted to murder that smug prick.

1807
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,889
Dusty, look, I hate that guy, too, okay?

1808
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,611
But his son is Dylan's best friend,
so you suck it up.

1809
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:17,091
I mean, that's most of
what dads do, is take shit.

1810
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,083
I mean, that's what we do.

1811
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,044
I can't do it, Brad.
I can't take shit like you do.

1812
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,327
You take shit better than
anyone I've ever met,

1813
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,568
and I mean that as a compliment
from the bottom of my heart.

1814
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,409
- Thank you.
- But I'm sorry, Brad. I can't.

1815
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,130
I can't do it, man.

1816
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,248
You made a promise to Megan,
and you're gonna keep it.

1817
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,083
Did you just punch me
in the face, Brad?

1818
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,201
Yes.

1819
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,006
Knowing full well I got no choice
but to bust you up now?

1820
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,844
I really wish you wouldn't.

1821
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,846
If I did, you'd take that beatdown
for those kids, wouldn't you?

1822
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,166
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

1823
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,001
- Come on.
- Good luck, Dusty.

1824
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,090
What? No, no, you gotta come.

1825
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:13,651
It's just... I can't see Sara
after what I said.

1826
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,848
Sara loves you, Brad. All right?
I know just what to say to her.

1827
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,684
You just stand there
and look lost without her.

1828
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,922
- I am lost without her.
- That's good. Then let's go.

1829
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,731
- But I look terrible.
- Yeah, you do. Come here.

1830
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,808
- What are you doing?
- I'm fixing you up, man.

1831
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,724
Dusty, get your hands out of my pants.

1832
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,121
Calm down. Think I want to
touch your little dinky?

1833
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,326
I'm trying to fix you up.

1834
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,045
All right. Let me see.

1835
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,646
Wow. I look great.

1836
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,051
Here you go.

1837
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,122
- That's incredible.
- Come on.

1838
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,724
He)', Pumpkin.

1839
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,486
Daddy wanted to be here,
I know he did. He just gets...

1840
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,923
She's doing her arms-folded thing.

1841
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,562
You said she'd smile.
Maybe even start a slow clap.

1842
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,244
Don't worry, I got this. Okay? Come on.

1843
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,322
Hey, look, it's the guy that
stranded his kids at school.

1844
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,840
And look who he's with.

1845
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,843
Did you get anybody pregnant
on your way over here, Brad?

1846
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,001
No, I didn't.

1847
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,605
- Sara, listen...
- No!

1848
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,609
- Sara, please.
- No. I am not going to listen to you.

1849
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:32,763
You know what? Your daughter's been
sitting there for two hours, heartbroken.

1850
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,161
Sara, I am so sorry...

1851
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,206
Just, please. Will one of you idiots
just ask your daughter to dance?

1852
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,771
- Really?
- Yes.

1853
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,771
Neither one of you deserves her,
butyes.

1854
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,284
- Go ahead, Dusty.
- No, you take the first one.

1855
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,486
You've earned it more than I have.

1856
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,130
Dusty, please, she's your daughter.

1857
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,326
What the hell did I miss?

1858
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:57,366
I'll tell you what. I'll vouch for you
to the kids and I'll take the first dance.

1859
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,046
I'll say my good-byes,
and then I'll get out of your hair.

1860
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,566
Wait, wait. When you say
"get out of your hair,"

1861
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,802
you mean leave,
like leave-leave? Tonight?

1862
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,565
Daddy! Brad!
The fourth graders are here.

1863
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,404
They're picking on Dylan again.

1864
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,882
That's it.
Those little shitheads are dead.

1865
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,086
Where are they?

1866
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,125
Those are the fourth graders?

1867
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,846
- They're girls.
- They're so mean.

1868
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,724
Why are you even here at
the Daddy-Daughter Dance?

1869
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,450
Are you a daughter? Are you a girl?

1870
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,569
Are you too scared to take me on
without your little friends?

1871
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,244
No, he's calling out the big one.

1872
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,321
No,no,no.

1873
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,561
Come on!

1874
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,201
Dylan!

1875
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,171
Yes!

1876
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,085
- Dylan, what are you doing?
- Did you see? Did you see?

1877
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,605
I punched her in the face,
just like you taught me.

1878
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,449
- What?
- And then I kicked her right in the nuts.

1879
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,045
You like that, bitch?

1880
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,650
- No, no, no!
- You want some more, bitch?

1881
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,401
Sweetheart, what happened?
What's going on here?

1882
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,090
He punched me in the face.

1883
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,929
Then he kicked me in the swimsuit area.

1884
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,843
Then he called me the "B" word.

1885
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,081
Who did, him?

1886
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,049
He did. I saw it.
He said they taught him to hit girls.

1887
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,367
No, no. We thought
your daughter was a boy.

1888
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,925
- What?
- No, what he means is that

1889
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,843
Dylan told us that a fourth grader
was picking on him,

1890
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,285
but he didn't tell us it was a girl.

1891
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,761
Yeah, and if you had, we'd have told you
it's never okay to hit a girl.

1892
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,921
And that she's probably
only bugging you

1893
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,121
because she likes you, buddy.

1894
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,124
I do not like him.

1895
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,771
I think she likes him.

1896
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,524
Gross, whatever.

1897
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,005
She totally does.

1898
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,411
Are you calling my daughter a whore?

1899
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,130
- What?
- They were implying it, Jerry.

1900
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,326
Wait. That's quite a stretch.

1901
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,602
Mrs. Troy, please. I got this.

1902
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,962
Wait, first of all, which one
of you two is the kid's dad?

1903
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,361
They both are.

1904
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,642
9h, my gosh. Wow!

1905
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:33,203
I'm sorry. That's the first time
he's ever referred to me as Dad.

1906
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,564
It's something I've wanted
to hear for a long time,

1907
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,444
so it's a bit poignant.

1908
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,682
I tend to cry a lot

1909
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:43,487
when things get emotional.
They tease me all the time.

1910
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,324
- I'm actually the stepdad.
- Is that right?

1911
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:46,731
So you're the real dad!

1912
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,369
Hey. You don't want to
embarrass yourself, buddy.

1913
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,204
You threatening me now, tough guy?

1914
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,521
- He's threatening you, Jerry.
- Nobody's threatening anybody.

1915
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,210
But you're gonna want to
back that up, Jerry.

1916
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,805
And you, Squidward tie.
Quit being an instigator,

1917
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,763
or I'm gonna have to
rap you in the mouth.

1918
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,848
Hey, hey, hey. Everyonejust calm down.

1919
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,251
We're at the Daddy-Daughter Dance.

1920
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,044
You stay out of it, all right?
You don't count!

1921
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,690
I want to talk to the real dad here.

1922
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,928
Hey, Brad here is more of
a real dad than any of us.

1923
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,604
You ever want to see
how you should be raising your kids,

1924
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,761
go look at this guy.

1925
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:15,171
Here I go again. What did I tell you?

1926
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,844
- Really? You mean that?
- Yes, I do, Brad.

1927
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,001
You're a great dad.

1928
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,406
- Like that?
- You shouldn't have done that.

1929
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,641
Yeah? Why?

1930
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,324
I'm pretty sure he kills people for a job.

1931
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:31,002
He's been rather vague with me,
but that's what I'm kind of surmising.

1932
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,725
- Are we gonna do this?
- We're gonna do it.

1933
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,370
- Okay. You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

1934
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,124
- This is what you get.
- Daddy.

1935
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,131
Want another one? Come on in.

1936
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,646
What's going on?

1937
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,770
Is this like some UFC shit?

1938
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:57,881
Come on, Brad.

1939
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,291
That's right. It's a dance, Jerry.

1940
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,721
Yeah. So dance, Jerry!

1941
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,963
Yeah! You just got served, Jerry!

1942
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,883
You just got a piping hot serving.

1943
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,691
I'm not getting served.
You're getting sewed!

1944
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,242
You don't know this about me, Jerry,
but I like to move my body.

1945
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,530
Get it, Brad!

1946
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,571
Yeah! Yeah, Brad!

1947
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,603
This is a dance! Let's go!

1948
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,523
Am I the only one with my shirt off?

1949
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,285
You know you can't leave, right?

1950
01:27:58,680 --> 01:27:59,681
You want me to stay?

1951
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,280
These guys are growing up so fast.
You don't want to miss it.

1952
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,364
You're sweating profusely.

1953
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,967
- I know. I sweat a lot.
- That's cool.

1954
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,041
Thank you.

1955
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,604
<i>So Dusty did stay.</i>

1956
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,685
<i>And with the huge amount of money</i>

1957
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,643
<i>he was making as
the voice of The Panda,</i>

1958
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,046
<i>he built his own new castle</i>

1959
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,610
<i>right down the street.</i>

1960
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,921
Hey!

1961
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,410
<i>But we kept Tumor because he didn't
get along with Dusty's new puppy.</i>

1962
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,922
<i>It turns out Tumor was only five...</i>

1963
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,690
<i>...so we're going to have him</i>

1964
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,410
<i>for a long, long time.</i>

1965
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,601
Tumor!

1966
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,444
<i>And I was more than a little surprised</i>

1967
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,564
<i>when Dusty showed up one day
with his new wife</i>

1968
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,441
<i>and his new stepdaughter.</i>

1969
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,404
This is my stepdaughter, Adriana.

1970
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,130
- Hey, Adriana. I'm Brad.
- Want to go play?

1971
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,489
That's your brother and sister.
You guys play nice, okay?

1972
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,846
Hey, hon. Who's at the door?

1973
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,689
Hey, Sara. This is my wife, Karen.

1974
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,444
Is it... Your wife?

1975
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,521
<i>That Karen, wow, she is so great.</i>

1976
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,170
<i>It turns out she's</i>

1977
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,762
a <i>doctor and</i> a <i>celebrated
novelist. I mean.</i>

1978
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,441
Hon, would you...

1979
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,451
- Come here, Griff. Come here, Griff.
- He's so cute.

1980
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:45,168
<i>And I was so surprised when
I found out that we're the same age.</i>

1981
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,327
<i>I mean, she looks so young, right?</i>

1982
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,046
<i>Good for her!</i>

1983
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,043
Honey, you look amazing tonight.

1984
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,565
What are you talking about?

1985
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,961
It's just my normal clothes.
That's how I look.

1986
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,724
I just got ready really fast.

1987
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,129
Hey, Griff. Hey, little Griffy.

1988
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,401
You want to come to Daddy?

1989
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,323
What, you think I'm going to
pick his pockets or something?

1990
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,004
- No.
- He doesn't carry a wallet.

1991
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,730
Sweetie, be careful
with that knife, okay?

1992
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,801
You're not my dad.

1993
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:09,921
<i>Brad was right.</i>

1994
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,570
<i>Being a stepdad isn't always easy.</i>

1995
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,081
<i>But he was also right that it's worth it.</i>

1996
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,402
<i>And he was right about
the Ford Flex, too.</i>

1997
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,085
<i>It's a great family car.</i>

1998
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:21,323
<i>Got plenty of room for the kids,
gear, and plenty of pickup for me.</i>

1999
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,010
<i>I got the Weekender package.</i>

2000
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,923
<i>A few more bells and
whistles than Brad's,</i>

2001
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,684
<i>but Brad doesn't need to know that.</i>

2002
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,161
Daddy!

2003
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,363
Sweetie, I've been waiting for you to...

2004
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,601
- Did you just gulp?
- No.

2005
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:55,961
I heard a gulp.

2006
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,451
Well, a little bit, maybe.

2007
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:58,961
- Sure.
- There you are.

2008
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,645
He's a lot bigger than you.

2009
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,281
He's got legs for arms.

2010
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,130
Little star, guess what?

2011
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,044
I like him. I like him a lot.

2012
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,282
Yeah. I bet you he's
going to like us, too.

2013
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,961
Remember, Loving Fence.
Just go say hi.

2014
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,971
Yeah, look, I got this, buddy. Watch.

2015
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,726
Hey. You must be Roger.

2016
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:17,961
Nope.
