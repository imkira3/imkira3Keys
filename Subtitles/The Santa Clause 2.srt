- What do you mean?

- Sheen?

- Not that Charlie.

Great! You told him!

- That would be me.

Santa clause.

the malls are filled
with other "Santa Clauses."

194

Yes, but there's another Santa clause.

but also a second clause.

When the last Santa fell off your roof
and you put on his coat, you found this.

Right. "He who wears the coat

"takes on the responsibilities
of Santa Claus."

But it seems our number two elf,
the keeper of the handbook,

202

overlooked the single
most important detail

I don't want to.

for a minute? Thank you.

00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,494
I want to show Santa
some improvements on the pantograph.

318
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,913
Thanks. Walk with me.

319
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,916
I've tripled the RAM
and reconfigured the circuitry.

320

I see you've externalized
the power source

to make better use
of the electromagnetic energy.

No, it's just there
'cause it looks really cool.

00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,219
Yeah, it does. (CHUCKLES)

324
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,930
Wait a minute. You tripled the RAM.

I am not getting in that machine.

won't solve our problems.

- But this would be a special toy!

- I added a fuzzy logic circuit.

No, the toy Santa will be dealing
with business up here.

I can deal with business up here.

472
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:31,078
not an expression of the joy
kids are supposed to be feeling.

473
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,999
- What kind of school is this?
- A public school.

474
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:39,962
A top-rated public school.
That takes effort. And money.

475
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:43,049
Spending any of that money
on holiday decorations

476
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,510
would take away
from the things that truly matter.

477
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,720
Forgive me, but I think
holiday cheer really matters.

478
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,598
What are we going to do?
We are worried...

479
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,101
Let me handle this.
You know what you did is wrong. Right?

480
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,103
- I guess so.
- There's no guessing.

481
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,773
Guessing is gone.
It was wrong what you did.

482
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,025
And you're not gonna do it again.
Promise me.

483
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,361
- Okay.
- There you go.

484
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,364
He won't do it again.
Meeting is adjourned.

485
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,866
It most certainly is not! Charlie...

486
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,369
You know what else?
Here's a little donation.

487
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,912
Why don't you buy yourself a wreath?

488
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,627
I am Santa Claus. Boo! (LAUGHS)

489
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,589
Yeah. No, no,
I think that this is gonna work.

490
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,967
Good job, Curtis.

491
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,387
Would it kill you
to give a wholehearted compliment?

492
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,680
Ho, ho, ho.

493
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,890
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Santa?

494
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,437
- I need you to look at this.
- All right!

495
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,898
Nice!

496
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,650
No. I mean, I need you to read it.

497
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,528
Well, let's try to be specific, shall we?

498
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,407
I'll take a look at it over at my desk.

499
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,578
- How does he know where it is?
- I programed him that way.

500
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,788
He has most of Santa's memories.

501
00:31:56,707 --> 00:32:00,209
Okay, we need you to study
everything that's in that book

502
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,629
because it is the key to being Santa.

503
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:07,842
Right! I'll memorize everything
in the book.

504
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,678
I'll follow all the rules.

505
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,473
'Cause rules are very important!

506
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,518
- I like this guy.
- I can barely read this.

507
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,020
Hi, Santa.

508
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,941
- Hi.
- Oh. You look...

509
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,444
Like he got a good night's sleep.

510
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,534
Like you got a very good night's sleep.

511
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,162
How about a nice chocolatey cocoa?

512
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,347
- Careful, it's hot.
- Of course it is.

513
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:02,897
(GULPING)

514
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,404
Ah!

515
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,909
Whoa!

516
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:19,080
That's delicious! I like cocoa!

517
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,791
Cocoa's superior refreshment!
(LAUGHS)

518
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:25,419
Get me some more cocoa! Whoo!

519
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,088
Right away, Santa.

520
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,923
Oh! Whoa!

521
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,926
I think Santa feels a little buzz!

522
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,261
Whoo!

523
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,599
Let me get this straight.
You were de-Santified?

524
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,436
And you only have 27 days
to find a wife or you're out?

525
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,855
Yeah.

526
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,525
What are you gonna do?
We dated for three years

527
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,944
before you got up the courage
to propose.

528
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,197
That's a pretty serious
commitment issue, isn't it?

529
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,158
Yes, Sigmund.
I was afraid I'd mess up the first time.

530
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,619
- I'm more afraid now.
- Dad, you can't give up.

531
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,496
There's never been a better Santa.

532
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,164
I appreciate that.

533
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,376
It's for the best.
If I had spent more time with you,

534
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,837
you'd spend less time
in the spray paint industry.

535
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,673
Don't do that to yourself.
You have been a great dad.

536
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,217
And being Santa has made you
an even better man.

537
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,553
I'm gonna go out on an emotional limb.

538
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,346
Don't try to make me cry.

539
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:21,392
Believe it or not,
you have a great capacity for love.

540
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:25,479
I know you can find someone wonderful
to spend the rest of your life with.

541
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:29,233
Don't let the facts that you
have no time, no prospects

542
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,319
and a paralyzing fear
of intimacy get you down.

543
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:33,904
Hmm.

544
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,157
Have you ever helped anyone? Ever?

545
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,577
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am gonna look through my phone book

546
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,413
and see who's still single out there
and not too bitter.

547
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,791
There's divorced moms at school
who'll go out with anybody.

548
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:49,503
As promising as this sounds,
I don't need help with this area.

549
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:53,007
Your old man was a high-school legend.
A double letterman.

550
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,842
I had a Mustang.

551
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,761
So as far as dating goes,

552
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:01,015
I think if anybody can stir up
the old mojo, it would be moi.

553
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,809
Come on! I don't think
there's a woman out there

554
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,895
that doesn't want a piece of this.

555
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,193
- LUCY: Hi, Mom!
- Lucy!

556
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,696
- Uncle Scott!
- How's my little sweet pea?

557
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,741
Oh, I haven't seen you in a long time.

558
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:23,370
- Tell me what's been happenin'.
- I learned to swim underwater.

559
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,499
- And I'm not afraid!
- That's amazing!

560
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:30,711
Maybe we'll have to go to the mall
and get some ice cream.

BERNARD: Santa, look forward
and put on a smiley face.

564
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:39,720
Say hello to your elves.

565
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:43,224
Ho, ho, ho!
You're doing a wonderful job!

566
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,895
Santa, when you said the bigger
wheels, is this what you meant?

567
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:52,066
Ho, ho, ho!
You're doing a wonderful job!

568
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,820
You're doing great.
Dial it down on the ho-ho-ho's,

569
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,696
but otherwise, you're gold.

570
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,657
Ho, ho, ho!

571
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:03,410
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

572
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:08,999
Why don't you just say it?
"You were right, Curtis. I was wrong."

573
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,252
Okay, okay, I admit it.

574
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,754
They're happy. They're working hard.

575
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,131
Everything's going to be fine.

576
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,300
This book is very interesting reading.

577
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,178
There's a lot of rules
they're not following.

578
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,264
That's what I've been saying all along.

579
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,684
Things have gotten a little too sloppy
around here.

580
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:31,230
Yes! Sloppiness means mistakes.
Mistakes aren't a good thing!

581
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,318
I might have to make
some changes here.

582
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,612
- What do you have in mind?
- Let me show you.

583
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,782
There's many things. Look here...

584
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:46,453
Neil, are you sure you don't have
any other clothes I can borrow?

585
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,206
I mean, the idea tonight
is to attract a woman.

586
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,334
- What are you talking about?
- I look like a limesicle.

587
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,461
I think it makes you look hot.

588
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,131
What do you think, Laura?
Honestly, what do you think? Huh?

589
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,632
Doesn't he look hot, Laura?

590
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,011
I think it's what's inside
that really counts.

591
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,388
- Thought you liked the sweater.
- We'll talk later.

592
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,807
I'm off. I may need to borrow a car.

593
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,560
I'm parked behind Neil.
The minivan, I just had it washed.

594
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,730
The minivan.

595
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,774
Okay, then. Well, wish me luck.

596
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,903
I got a needlepoint sweater
and a minivan.

So, I'm so glad we finally got to do this.

- Oh. Are you? (LAUGHS)

Laura says we have a lot in common.

609

I hear that you love
this time of year also?

610
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,611
It's my favorite time of year
and my busiest time of year.

- Yeah! (LAUGHS)

Some sweater. Like I should talk!

I also have my Christmas

- That's beautiful. Look at 'em!
- Yeah.

- As a singer-songwriter.
- No way!

626
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,495
Way!

- Country-western.

629
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,002
- (ENTHUSIASTICALLY) Oh!
- Yeah.

630

- Do you like Shania Twain?
- Yeah!

(SINGING) The best thing about
singing at Christmas

632
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,637
Is the cocoa, caroling and fun

633
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:09,805
- You know that one?
- I know that song.

(NASALLY) Uh, whoah-oh-oh

648
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:39,877
I want to be free
yeah, to feel the way I feel

You hated it?

656
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,485
It kind of scared me a little bit.

657
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,489
No, I just. I...

658
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,784
I just... I wasn't prepared
for a performance, so if I...

659
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:15,704
I put myself out and that was
not an easy thing to do.

660
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,082
If you can't support a woman's ambition,

661
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,501
then I don't think there's any reason
to continue this date.

- Hey, sport.

00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,425
How'd it go?

665
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,843
Well...

666
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,431
Let's just say
I'm not bookin' a church yet.

Boy, I'll tell ya,
women are hard to figure out.

669
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,272
- Tell me about it.
- You too, huh? Girl trouble?

670
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,235
- Well, there's this one girl.
- Mmm.

671
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,363
We just used to be friends
and hang out at the mall and stuff.

672
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,116
Then one day, I looked at her,

673
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,701
and I got this weird feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

674
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,997
I started worrying about what to wear
and what my hair looked like.

675
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,668
- And then I wanted to kiss her.

How did she do that?

677

I don't know. But they all can do that.

678
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,512
Look at that. The snow globe!

679
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,641
This is so beautiful. I remember
when Bernard gave this to you.

680
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,726
He said all I have to do
to see you is shake it.

681
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,273
Now, all you have to do
is yell down the hall.

682
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,400
And I'm there whenever you need me.

683

Yeah.

684
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,281
I'm a little tired, Dad.
I'll see you in the morning.

Okay.

something like that?

Well, most of them live in Finland.
I can't pronounce their names.

Besides, reindeer are too stupid
to make good pets.

- No, I didn't.

I'll give you a big fat for instance!

782
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:16,541
In Denmark, there's a guy
named Sven Halstrom right here.

783
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:20,587
He's a Dane. He was wiping
his nose on his sister's shirt.

784
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:24,799
Yuk! That's not very nice!
And yet, he's on the nice list.

785
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,303
We try to cut most children
slack this time of year.

786
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:32,516
I don't understand that!
Kids are misbehaving everywhere.

787
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,143
They're running with scissors.
They're sticky.

788
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,938
"I'm not gonna stop this car!"
"No, we're not there yet!"

789
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,649
"Brush your teeth!"
"Pick up those clothes!"

790
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,734
It goes on and on.

791
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:46,446
But they're just kids!
Everybody misbehaves some time.

792
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,407
But according to The Santa Handbook,

793
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:53,036
naughty kids get lumps of coal
in their stockings. Right?

794
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,497
We will make stockings.

795
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:59,834
In my opinion, they should all
get coal in their stockings.

796
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,629
- Don't you?
- No! That's not how it works!

797
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,590
Get me the naughty-nice list.
Get me every list!

798
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,301
Get me everything.

799

(RAP SONG PLAYING)

800
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,272
Mr. O'Reilly, Mr. Leary.

801
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,649
You in charge of the gangbangers?

802
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,734
They're students, actually, and yes.

803
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,028
Keep 'em away from the car. It's new.

804
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,489
I don't need some delinquent
kids scratchin' it up.

805
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:33,243
They're not delinquents.
And don't worry about your car.

806
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,246
I'd worry about your legs
in those shorts.

807
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,373
I thought only swimmers
shaved their legs!

808
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,835
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

809
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,921
- Brought you coffee.
- Thank you.

810
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:49,593
- So you have a nice-guy side.
- I'm a man of many sides.

811
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:52,679
I'm a puzzle.
I'm a Rubik's Cube with pants.

- (LAUGHS)
- A laugh! Actual laugh.

813
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,143
- Dad, it doesn't come off.
- It's not supposed to come off.

814
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,604
Hence, you've got to be careful
where you put it.

815
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,815
Hence, tagging is serious.
Hence, your presence here.

816
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,028
Don't say "hence" anymore, Dad.
It's really annoying.

How do you do it? I have trouble
with one. You have hundreds.

820
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,248
- Hi.
- Hi.

821
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:23,543
- I was really good this year.
- (CHUCKLES)

822
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:27,547
Is that so? Are you absolutely
sure about that, Pamela?

823
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,842
I want a doll house
and a swimming pool.

824
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,594
A swimming pool?

825
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,888
I'm sorry. She insisted on talking to you.

826
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,057
- It's not a problem.
- Okay.

827
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:41,895
I'll tell you what. If you can
promise me you'll be good,

828
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:45,023
I can guarantee
you'll have a great Christmas.

- Okay! Yeah!
- (LAUGHS) Come on.

00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,160
Kids get so nutty this time of year.

831
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,580
- Is she a neighbor?
- No.

832
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,290
How did you know her name?

833
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,918
The necklace, it said Pamela on it.

834
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,796
Oh. I guess I missed that.
I'm gonna go check on this group.

835
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,845
You cost me, Pamela.

836
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,893
I just couldn't sleep
thinking about all those rules.

837
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,688
Am I wrong? Am I right? Does it matter?

838
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,440
Couldn't have been
the three gallons of cocoa I had!

839
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,944
But you understand rules, don't you?
You're highly decorated.

840
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,197
And look at that face. There you go.

841
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,533
There's a face only a mom would like.

842
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,619
I don't have a mom,
so I wouldn't know about that.

843
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:42,414
Now, it's time for the big event.

You're in the spotlight.
Get bigger with it.

847
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,842
It's your big chance. I need a little help.

848
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:57,053
I need a little muscle.
I need a little nudge.

849
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,556
Let's call yourself the little nudge!

850
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,560
This won't hurt, except
for the electric shock through you.

See ya on the other side!

- Hi.

It looks like you're going out.
Sorry. I should have called.

No, it's okay. Come in.

- Uh-huh.

- Is there a problem?
- No, no. I just...

00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,644
I wondered if...

858
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,689
If you would... (STAMMERS)

00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:53,026

Or pie?

861
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,491
But I don't want to
keep you from your date, so...

862
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,368
Oh, it's not a date.
It's the faculty Christmas party.

00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,828
Oh.

864
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,165
Is that your idea of a night on the town?

865
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,458
Noodles and pie? (GIGGLES)

866
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,504
- Yes. What would be your idea?
- Pizza and a movie.

867
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,297
- Thick or thin crust?
- Thin.

868
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,799
Good! Movie?

Movie's okay, but the car was the star.
'53 MG TD.

00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,766
Racing green, wire wheels. Beautiful.

872
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,144
I'm impressed. That is a great car.
My favorite car.

873
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,104
Didn't like driving 'em in the rain.

874
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,358
You have to push it to start it.
Other than that, it's perfect.

875
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,485
It's perfect, though.

876
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,575
- I could drive you to your party.
- That would be great.

877
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,328
Except for, eventually,
I'm going to have to get home.

878
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,748
Well, I could pick you up.

879
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,918
So you're going to drop me off,
then come back and pick me up?

880
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,963
- Yeah.
- Why don't you just stay?

881
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,382
- All right, I'll stay.
- I'll get my coat.

882
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,885
So, Mr. Andretti, what are you driving?

883
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,263
You know, I think you're gonna like it.

Mind if I ask you something personal?

00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,631
Please.

888
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,259
- You look really different.
- The weight.

889
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:45,930
It's Indian teas and
it's a lot of salves and stuff. It's...

890
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:48,099
- Do you want some cocoa?
- Yes.

891
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,477
Cocoa. You have thought of everything.

892
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,898
Well, this time of year, I really shine.

893
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:57,567
Yeah, I can't wait till it's over, though.

894
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,903
Streets are crowded,
the malls are jammed,

895
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,989
people max out their credit cards...
It's noisy.

896
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,532
When did you become such a cynic?

00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,618
Oh.

898
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,536
I don't know.

899
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,039
I used to love Christmas, too.

900
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:14,584
It was the only day
that my parents didn't fight.

901

- Oh.
- Oh.

902
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:20,256
They were at each other all the time.

903
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:24,218
But on Christmas,
they tried to make the holiday special.

904
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:27,805
My dad went through this charade
so I'd believe in Santa Claus.

905
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,434
He put a cot by the fireplace
so Santa could take a nap...

906
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,186
Like he has time to take a nap!

907
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,607
Consider the amount of gifts
he would have to deliver.

908
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,068
Why would he nap?
He would probably need some coffee.

909
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:43,863
Yeah. And there was cocoa
and cookies.

910
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,075
And carrots for the reindeer.

911
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,661
That's a good gesture.
The reindeer love carrots.

912
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,955
And the thought
is important to them, too.

913
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:57,001
Yeah. And I'd wake up, and the cocoa
and cookies would be gone,

914
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:59,629
and the cot would be mussed
and the carrots gnawed.

915
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:04,425
They swallow them.
If they're fresh, they'll eat 'em like that.

916
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,302
They love red bell peppers, too.

917
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:08,471
You know the stories. If you read...

00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:14,227
And there would be incredible presents
under the tree.

920
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:18,064
One year was a rocking horse,
and I named it Harvey.

921
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:21,234
And the next year
was a little red wagon,

922
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,320
which I made a lemonade stand,
which was great.

923
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,906
And the last year was...

924
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:31,077
It was just a Baby Doll.
She was pink and soft and beautiful.

925
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:35,665
- Beautiful?
- Yes.

926
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:40,837
I believed in Santa so much
I'd get in fights at school

927
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:43,339
with kids who tried to tell me
that he didn't exist.

928
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,591
And one day,
I came home with a bloody nose.

929
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,721
That's when my parents
decided to tell me to

930
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:51,597
grow up.

931
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,725
I was devastated.

932
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:58,980
Good, Carol! This is great
sleigh-riding conversation!

There we go. Hi. I'm Scott Calvin
and I just thought I'd step up here and...

961
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:55,388
And say the word that
we've all been longing to hear.

is that a lot of you have forgotten

of Christmas is all about.

I don't think we have much choice.

She's afraid these are decorations
for the caroling.

when I saw this bag of gifts.

looks like a bag of gifts.

Okay, ready? Go!

1093
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,152
This is what I call community service!

1094
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,945
Here she comes. Duck down!

SCOTT: Hey!

1097
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:37,826
Attention you hooligans
behind that snowbank!

1098
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,912
You have snowballed the wrong house.

1099
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:44,333
Drop the snowballs,
kick them away from the snowsuits

1100
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,251
and keep the mittens
where I can see them.

1101
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,171
Your dad is hanging
with Principal Newman?

1102
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,298
- Is he dating her?
- No.

1103
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,927
Go to your homes.
Pelt the ones you love.

1104
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,429
- And a merry Christmas!
- (CAROL LAUGHS)

1105
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,266
- That is really gross, man.
- Shut up.

1106
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,908
There are things about me
you should know. Personal things.

1107
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,702
We don't need to rush things, Scott.

1108
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,413
I think you need to know these things.

1109
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,415
Okay.

1110
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:32,381
Remember the mistletoe,
how it just showed up?

1111
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,133
- Yes.
- And the sleigh.

1112
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,510
- How magical that was?
- Yes.

1113
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,595
Secret Santa Claus?

1114
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,681
- That was me.
- Yeah?

1115
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:47,563
I'm not this size much.
I'm usually much bigger than this.

1116
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,356
So am I sometimes.

1117
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:51,775
I have a big white beard that's beautiful.

1118
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,528
- I don't.
- I work a long way from home.

1119
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,905
When I get back home,
I sleep for a long time.

1120
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,950
See? Okay. It's not so bad so far.

1121
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,578
You work far away from home
and you sleep a lot.

You've never been to prison

What?

1127
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:17,634
The suit, the red suit's real.
The North Pole is a place.

1128
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:22,473
There are elves. They make toys.
They're beautiful and it's real.

1129
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,391
- I exist.
- That's not funny.

- It's magical.
- Cut it out.

I'm telling the truth.

1132
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,521
I told you something personal
from my childhood

1133
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:33,859
and now you're making a joke
out of it and it's not funny. It hurts.

1134
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:38,864
I know how hard this is to believe,
but connect the dots.

1135
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,950
- Think what's happened.
- I know what's going on.

1136
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:44,828
- Think about the little girl.
- You felt something for me.

1137
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:47,998
Now you're acting like a mental patient
because you're scared.

1138
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:51,919
- I deliver gifts in a sleigh.
- Incredible.

1139
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:55,506
I go down chimneys with burning logs
and I still deliver gifts.

1140
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,758
I'm not scared. That's not what this is.

1141
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,134
If you're trying to push me away,
it's working.

1142
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,762
Carol, don't make me leave.

1143
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:03,889
Please.

CHARLIE: How could you pick her?
SCOTT: I didn't.

1145

- You want it? Here it is.

- I don't live a normal life.

1151
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:50,435
- You live a great life here.
- Just listen to me!

1152

My friends get to go around
saying, "My dad's a plumber."

1153
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,900
"My dad's a pilot." "My dad's a dentist."
You know what?

1154
01:09:56,985 --> 01:10:00,529
My dad is the best thing of all
and I can't tell anyone.

1155
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:06,118
You have no idea how hard it is,
walking around with that secret.

1156
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:09,705
And now you're going out
with Principal Newman!

1157
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,165
And you don't even tell me about it.

about secrets, and I hate it!

and blow bubbles in his milk.
