00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:03,647
<i>Put your faith in what you most believe in</i>

2
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:07,610
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

3
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,697
<i>Trust your heart
Let fate decide</i>

4
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:16,452
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

5
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:21,332
<i>A paradise untouched by man</i>

6
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:25,086
<i>Within this world blessed with love</i>

7
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:30,174
<i>A simple life
They live in peace</i>

8
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:34,595
<i>Softly tread the sand
below your feet now</i>

9
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:38,307
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

10
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,520
<i>Trust your heart
Let fate decide</i>

11
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:47,066
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

12
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:52,238
<i>Beneath the shelter of the trees</i>

13
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:56,033
<i>Only love can enter here</i>

14
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,122
<i>A simple life
They live in peace</i>

15
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,959
<i>Raise your head up
Lift high the load</i>

16
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:09,171
<i>Take strength from those
that need you</i>

17
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:13,592
<i>Build high the walls
Build strong the beams</i>

18
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:15,845
<i>A new life is waiting</i>

19
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:19,515
<i>But danger's no stranger here</i>

20
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,710
<i>No words describe a mother's tears</i>

21
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:52,423
<i>No words can heal a broken heart</i>

22
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:56,635
<i>A dream is gone
but where there's hope</i>

23
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,390
<i>Somewhere, something is calling for you</i>

24
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,810
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

25
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:09,190
<i>Trust your heart
Let fate decide</i>

26
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:13,694
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

27
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,642
<i>Every moment now
the bond grows stronger</i>

28
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:59,146
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

29
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,358
<i>Trust your heart
Let fate decide</i>

30
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:08,030
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

31
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,792
Mama, look!
Look over there!

32
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,794
- Kala!
- She's back.

33
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:26,381
- I told you she was comin' back.
- We looked everywhere for you.

34
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,384
Are you all right, dear?

35
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,386
I'm fine. No, really, honestly.

36
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,516
It's just that I got a little bit...
sidetracked.

37
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,228
Well, isn't that...

38
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:43,023
- Well, it's so...
- Why, it's, it's just so...

39
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,651
It's freaky-lookin'.
That's what it is.

40
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,903
- Terkina!
- Well, it is!

41
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,656
I mean, what the heck is it anyway?

42
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,824
He's a baby.

43
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,661
I can't

44
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,040
So, where's his mama?

45
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,126
Well, I'm going to be his mother now.

46
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:12,052
You know, he's not so bad,
once you get used to him.

47
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,347
Kala's gonna be its mother now.

48
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,064
Kerchak, I saved him from Sabor.

49
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,903
Kala, it won't replace the one we lost.

50
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:33,991
I know that.
But he needs me.

51
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,619
But it, it...

52
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:41,206
Kala, look at it.
It's not our kind.

53
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:45,085
No, you have to take it back.

54
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,046
Take him back?
But he'll die.

55
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,340
- If the jungle wants him...
- I want him.

56
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,676
I cannot let you
put our family in danger.

57
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,512
Does he look dangerous to you?

58
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,398
Was it alone?

59
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,900
Yes. Sabor killed his family.

60
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,111
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

61
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,155
There are no others.

62
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,409
Then you may keep him.

63
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,330
Kerchak, I know he'll be a good son.

64
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,165
I said he could stay.

65
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,959
That doesn't make him my son.

66
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,714
We will nest here for the night.

67
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,097
So, what you gonna call it?

68
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,725
I'm gonna call him...

69
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,060
...Tarzan.

70
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,396
Tarzan? OK, he's your baby.

71
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,733
All right, little lady, come on.
It's past your nest time.

72
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,193
- Oh, Mom.
- No.

73
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,363
Five more minutes?
Two more minutes?

74
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,406
One more minutes?

75
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:09,211
Don't cry. I'm here.
Come on. Come on.

76
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,755
<i>Come, stop your crying</i>

77
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,633
<i>It will be all right</i>

78
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:19,388
<i>Just take my hand
Hold it tight</i>

79
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:24,142
<i>I will protect you
from all around you</i>

80
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:29,398
<i>I will be here, don '2' you cry</i>

81
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:34,528
<i>For one so small
You seem so strong</i>

82
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,699
<i>My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm</i>

83
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:43,870
<i>This bond between us
Can '2' be broken</i>

84
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:48,458
<i>I will be here, don '2' you cry</i>

85
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:52,879
<i>Cos you'll be in my heart</i>

86
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:57,300
<i>Yes, you'll be in my heart</i>

87
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,387
<i>From this day on</i>

88
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,558
<i>Now and forever more</i>

89
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:12,023
<i>You'll be in my heart</i>

90
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:17,237
<i>No matter what they say</i>

91
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,950
<i>You'll be here in my heart</i>

92
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,536
<i>Always</i>

93
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,751
Always.

94
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,276
Tarzan.

95
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,737
Tarzan?

96
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,492
I sure scared you, Mom.

97
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,702
You sure did.

98
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,079
Can't you imitate any quieter animal?

99
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,123
Mom, they're no fun.

100
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,292
Wanna see me be a leopard?

101
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,963
Why don't you just come up
with your own sound?

102
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,013
Kala.

103
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,685
Oops.

104
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,900
Tarzan! Thank goodness
you're all right!

105
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,904
Kala and I have been so worried.

106
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,907
Thank you so much
for finding him, Kerchak.

107
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,118
You are such a wise and caring leader.

108
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,412
Run.

109
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,211
- Hello! Are you thick in the head?
- What?

110
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,255
How many times
do I have to tell you?

111
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,967
If you want Kerchak to like you,
stay away from him.

112
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,677
Come on, Terk, step on it!

113
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,514
- Last one there is a dung beetle!
- The first one's gotta eat it.

114
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,807
Terk, can I come?

115
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,144
Well, you could if you could keep up,
but, you know, you can't really keep up.

116
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:17,065
Wait up, guys!
Wait up! Right behind you!

117
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,867
You're standing on my spleen.

118
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,910
Take that!
Stop hitting yourself.

119
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:32,372
Stop hitting yourself.
Stop hitting yourself.

120
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,959
<i>The fun has arrived</i>

121
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,545
- Thank you very much.
- What took you so long?

122
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:42,215
I had a little pest control problem,
but it's all taken care of.

123
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,677
Hi, guys.

124
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,221
Terk, what is this,
some kind of joke?

125
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,308
Tell me I'm not looking
at the hairless wonder.

126
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,352
Well, Terk said I could come along
if I could keep up.

127
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:57,731
- No, no.
- Terk. Come on.

128
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,776
I'll handle this, guys, OK?
Listen, buddy. Come here.

129
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,113
We got a tiny, little, itsy-bitsy
problem here, OK?

130
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,325
I'd love to hang outwith you.
You know I would.

131
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,453
But the guys... they need
a little convincing, you know?

132
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:15,290
- OK, what do I gotta do?
- Do? What do you gotta do?

133
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,459
It's so stupid.

134
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,585
What?

135
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:23,381
Well, you gotta...
you gotta go get a hair.

136
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:26,468
- A hair?
- Yeah, a hair.

137
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,555
An elephant hair.

138
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,645
An elephant hair?

139
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,439
Like I said, it's stupid, right?

140
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,275
Listen, take it from me.
Go home. OK?

141
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,486
Who needs this aggravation?

142
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,280
You know, I'm probably
gonna leave soon myself.

143
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,283
You go, I'll catch up, all right?

144
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,578
You see? Leave it to me.
I told you I could...

145
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,206
Tarzan! Tarzan!

146
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,217
That one hurt him.

147
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,903
Look! There he is!

148
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,655
He's alive!

149
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,658
- Hey, guys!
- Hi.

150
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,706
Come back! Come back.

151
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,332
This guy's great.

152
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,293
If he lives, you should
bring him around more often.

153
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,046
Come on, come on.
Let's go get a better seat.

154
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,427
You can never get enough sleep,
let me tell you.

155
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,095
- I get enough sleep.
- Mom?

156
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:56,141
- It burns up the calories.
- Are you sure this water's sanitary?

157
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,060
It looks questionable to me.

158
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,229
It's fine, honey.

159
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,358
But what about bacteria?

160
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:09,154
Tantor, can't you see
Mummy's talking?

161
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,286
Watch out!
There's something swimming!

162
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:20,081
- It's coming right at you!
- Honey, Mummy's losing her patience.

163
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,418
- But this time I really see something.
- Oh, boy.

164
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,087
Piranha! It's a piranha!

165
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,632
Sweetheart, there are no
piranhas in Africa.

166
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,261
Don't tell the kid that.
Of course there are piranhas in Africa.

167
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,222
No, she's right.
They're native to South America.

168
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,016
- Get outta here.
- It's true.

169
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,476
- No way.
- Come on, now.

170
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,311
Think I'd be here if there were?

171
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,480
It's right behind you! Run!

172
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:48,485
For the last time, honey
there are no piranhas in.

173
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,944
My butt!

174
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,156
- Told you!
- There's something on my butt!

175
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,992
- What is it?
- Are there any more of them?

176
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,706
- What is it?
- It's a piranha.

177
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,587
Piranha!

178
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,342
Tantor, where are you?

179
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,978
He's dead.

180
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,648
We're dead!

181
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,573
We didn't do it!
They're the ones!

182
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,385
Oh, thank you, Kerchak.

183
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,974
Tarzan, buddy! Buddy, come on!

184
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,226
Tarzan, don't die on me!
Don't die!

185
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,645
- You weren't supposed to do it!
- Get away!

186
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,898
Don't you know a piranha
can strip your flesh in seconds?

187
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,276
What? He's not a piranha!

188
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,195
He's alive!

189
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,531
He's alive! He's alive!

190
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,575
- He's alive!
- He's...

191
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,076
You idiot!

192
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,121
You nearly gave me a heart attack!
You happy?

193
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,834
I don't believe it.
You got the hair?

194
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:32,505
Is that what this is all about?
I got a whole tail of them.

195
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,674
- Tarzan?
- Terkina?

196
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,176
Oh, no.

197
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,887
- Who's that?
- My mom.

198
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,638
- Tarzan.
- Hi.

199
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,141
- Hi, Aunt Kala.
- Oh, you scared me!

200
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,393
- What happened?
- Well, I...

201
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,562
It's sort of a long...
It's involved.

202
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,898
Because what happened,
it was a weird...

203
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,691
What happened?

204
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,653
It was my fault, Kerchak.

205
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,946
Tarzan.

206
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:02,076
We were playing, and...
Well, I'm sorry, Kerchak.

207
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,204
You almost killed someone.

208
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,456
- It was an accident.
- He's only a child.

209
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,250
That's no excuse.
You can't keep defending him.

210
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,920
- He'll learn.
- You can't learn to be one of us.

211
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,048
- You never give him a chance.
- Give him a chance?

212
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:19,219
Kala, look at him.
He will never be one of us.

213
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,512
Kerchak!

214
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,473
Tarzan.

215
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,484
Tarzan, what are you doing?

216
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,112
Why am I so different?

217
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,364
You're covered with mud,
that's why.

218
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,534
- Kerchak said I didn't belong in...
- Close your mouth.

219
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,953
Kerchak said I don't
belong in the family.

220
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,539
Never mind what Kerchak said.

221
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,458
- Hold still.
- But look at me!

222
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,754
I am, Tarzan.

223
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,548
And do you know what I see?

224
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:42,093
I see two eyes, like mine,

225
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:46,097
and a nose, somewhere.

226
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,266
Here.

227
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,685
Two ears.

228
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,439
- And let's see, what else?
- Two hands?

229
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,274
That's right.

230
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,459
Close your eyes.

231
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,503
Now, forget what you see.

232
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,547
What do you feel?

233
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,258
My heart.

234
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,260
Come here.

235
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,805
- Your heart.
- See?

236
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:30,475
We're exactly the same.

237
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,897
Kerchak just can't see that.

238
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,942
I'll make him see it.

239
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,904
I'll be the best ape ever.

240
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,281
Oh, I bet you will.

241
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:02,215
<i>Oh, the power to be strong</i>

242
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,843
<i>And the wisdom to be wise</i>

243
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:10,807
<i>All these things
will come to you in time</i>

244
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:15,395
<i>On this journey that you're making</i>

245
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,273
<i>There'll be answers that you'll seek</i>

246
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:22,485
<i>And it's you who'll climb the mountain</i>

247
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:26,197
<i>It's you who'll reach the peak</i>

248
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,742
<i>Son of Man, look to the sky</i>

249
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,995
<i>Lift your spirit, set it free</i>

250
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,457
<i>Someday you'll walk tall with pride</i>

251
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:41,504
<i>Son of Man,
a man in time you'll be</i>

252
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:56,519
<i>Though there's no one there
to guide you</i>

253
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:00,273
<i>No one to take your hand</i>

254
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,568
<i>But with faith and understanding</i>

255
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:07,447
<i>You will journey from boy to man</i>

256
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,533
<i>Son of Man, look to the sky</i>

257
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:14,036
<i>Lift your spirit, set it free</i>

258
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,415
<i>Someday you'll walk tall with pride</i>

259
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:22,420
<i>Son of Man,
a man in time you'll be</i>

260
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,844
<i>In learning you will teach</i>

261
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:34,474
<i>And in teaching you will learn</i>

262
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:39,437
<i>You'll find your place
beside the ones you love</i>

263
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:44,275
<i>Oh, and all the things
you dreamed of</i>

264
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:47,987
<i>The visions that you saw</i>

265
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,199
<i>Well, the time is drawing near now</i>

266
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:54,577
<i>It's yours to claim it all</i>

267
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:58,080
<i>Son of Man, look to the sky</i>

268
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,459
<i>Lift your spirit, set it free</i>

269
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,254
<i>Someday you'll walk tall with pride</i>

270
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:10,384
<i>Son of Man,
a man in time you'll be</i>

271
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,893
<i>Son of Man</i>

272
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:23,898
<i>Son of Man's a man for all to see</i>

273
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,042
Don't even think about it.

274
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,548
- How'd you know it was me?
- I'm your mother. I know everything.

275
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:51,467
- Where have you been?
- I thought you knew everything.

276
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,930
Hey, Auntie K, you're looking
remarkably groomed today.

277
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,598
Hello, Terk.

278
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,434
Not the neck!
Not the neck there, T.

279
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,646
Watch it!

280
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:10,403
OK, it's all fun and games
till someone loses an eye.

281
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,905
Please stop.
Somebody's gonna get hurt here.

282
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:15,533
- And it's always me.
- Cramp in the calf.

283
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,160
- Please!
- OK. OK, you win.

284
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:22,707
OK, OK, you win. Hello!
Down here. Yo, yo! Let go!

285
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,751
- Oh, sorry, Terk.
- What kind of animal are you?

286
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,462
I been thinking lately
that maybe Tarzan

287
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,715
could be some subspecies of elephant.

288
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,842
What are you, crazy?
An elephant?

289
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:36,804
Listen to me. Think about it.
He enjoys a peanut, I enjoy a peanut.

290
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,806
He looks nothing like you.

291
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,684
OK everybody, move aside.
Outta my way.

292
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,937
Best friend coming through.
That would be me.

293
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,231
And you,
don't make a habit of that.

294
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,734
There are other ways
of getting attention.

295
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,069
- I'll try to remember that.
- All right.

296
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,989
I was right behind you.
I had you covered.

297
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,153
What was that?

298
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,948
It wasn't me, I swear.

299
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,491
OK, well, maybe it was.

300
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,661
Everyone, let's move.

301
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:20,170
I was reminded of a safari
I led up the Zambezi.

302
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:24,341
Marvellous. Lots of hunting, yes.
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

303
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,302
Wildebeest everywhere.

304
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:31,098
Two bearers loading three riﬂes
for me, blasting away.

305
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:35,352
That's when I knew
I was born for Africa

306
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:38,522
and Africa was created for...

307
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:48,157
Clayton?

308
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,451
Clayton...
Oh, there you are.

309
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,579
What is it? What is it, Clayton?
Are we in danger?

310
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,414
I thought I saw something.

311
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:59,043
<i>Is it a Hippopotamus amphibious
or a Rhinoceros bihornus?</i>

312
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,670
- Professor, don't move!
- Oh, right.

313
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:03,297
Daddy?

314
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,635
Daddy, what's all the hullabaloo about?

315
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,390
What is it, Daddy?

316
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:16,560
Mr Clayton asked me not to move.
He saw something.

317
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:20,689
I moved.

318
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,651
Uh, Mr Clayton?
Sorry, excuse me.

319
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:27,279
But my father and I came on this
expedition to study gorillas,

320
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:30,449
and I believe your shooting
might be scaring them off.

321
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,993
You hired me to protect you,
Miss Porter,

322
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:35,079
and protect you I shall.

323
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,373
And you're doing a marvellous job of it.

324
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,960
But we only have a short time
before the ship returns, you see...

325
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:44,588
Jane! Jane, do you realize
what you're standing in?

326
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,091
- A gorilla's nest!
- Daddy!

327
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:50,636
At last! Our first sign in days

328
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,430
Do you think the beasts
could be nearby?

329
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:56,100
Could be. Why, I mean,
there's the evidence.

330
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,977
They can't be very far, anyway.

331
00:32:58,102 --> 00:32:59,853
Look! Over there and there...

332
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,438
Where?
Yes, more nests!

333
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,607
- I see them!
- Just as you predicted!

334
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:05,150
Family groups!

335
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:07,111
Oh, Jane, I love you.

336
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,322
Family groups?

337
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,866
Excuse me,
but these are wild beasts

338
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,953
that would sooner tear your head off
than look at you.

339
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,830
On the contrary, Mr Clayton.

340
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:21,333
Daddy's theory is these are
social creatures, not monsters.

341
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,174
Mr Clayton, please.
What if it's a gorilla?

342
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,301
It's no gorilla.

343
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:37,808
- Perhaps we should press on.
- Yes, indeed.

344
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:41,770
We should keep heading west,
following the Ganoderma ablonatum.

345
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,605
Excellent, professor.

346
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,692
I could've used your expertise
on my last safari.

347
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,319
I was in the mountainous region
of Zambia.

348
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:51,822
Yes, very dangerous.

349
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,869
Are you what all the fuss was about?

350
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:00,039
Daddy! Daddy, quick!

351
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,124
No, wait. Hold still.

352
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,792
Oh, my good...

353
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:08,672
You may not be a gorilla,
but you are one sweet little...

354
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,845
There. What do you think?

355
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,728
Why, you little...

356
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,606
Well, this is absolutely peachy.

357
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:30,486
Come to study gorillas and get my
sketchbook pinched by a baboon.

358
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,411
Give me that!

359
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:44,875
Come on now, enough of this.
I want this paper on the count of three.

360
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,627
One.

361
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,420
Two.

362
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:49,797
Look,bananas!

363
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,719
I can't believe you fell for that one.

364
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:59,389
No, no, don't give me
those crocodile tears.

365
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,600
What would your parents have to say?

366
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,815
You see, I told you they'd be cross.

367
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,567
Go easy on him.
Children will be children.

368
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,755
I'm flying!

369
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,841
What on earth am I...

370
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:39,096
Get off! Get off!

371
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,395
Put me down! Put me down!

372
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,439
No, pick me up, pick me up!

373
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,946
Help!

374
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,677
Unhand me, monkey!

375
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,490
Over there!

376
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,502
I'm in a tree with a man
who talks to monkeys.

377
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,546
I can't do this. I can't...

378
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,174
This is good.
This is very good.

379
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,468
Wait.

380
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,929
One, two.

381
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:49,476
It can't get any worse, can it?

382
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,398
Obviously it can.

383
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,993
Stay back. No, don't...
Don't come any closer.

384
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,244
Please, don't.

385
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,413
What are you...
What are you doing?

386
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:13,041
No, please don't.
That tickles.

387
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,085
No, get off, get off. Get off!

388
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,629
It serves you right.

389
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:20,299
Stay away from me,
like a very good wild man.

390
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:22,592
You stay. I'm warning you.

391
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,678
My father won't take kindly to you...

392
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:28,056
No. That's...
That's close enough.

393
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,350
How dare you?

394
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,106
Oh, dear.

395
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,609
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

396
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:22,527
Yes, thank you.

397
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:26,490
That's a lovely heartbeat.
It's very nice.

398
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,827
- It's very nice.
- Oh, thank you.

399
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:34,122
I can't do a thing with it
in this humidity though.

400
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,582
You do speak!

401
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:39,669
All this time I thought you were a big,
wild, quiet, silent person thing.

402
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:43,632
Why didn't you tell me? I must say
I'm rather curious as to who you are.

403
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:47,844
Tarzan.

404
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,059
Tarzan.

405
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,937
Tarzan?

406
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,985
Oh, I see.

407
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,821
Tarzan.

408
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,823
Oh, I see.

409
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,620
I'm Jane.

410
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,999
I'm Jane.

411
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:23,547
Jane. Tarzan.

412
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,215
Jane.

413
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,384
Jane.

414
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,761
Exactly.

415
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,596
Clayton!

416
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:39,146
- Clayton.
- Extraordinary.

417
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:43,650
Please, can you take me to my camp?

418
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,237
Yes, Clayton. Wonderful.

419
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,867
Can't we walk?

420
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,786
Can't we walk?!

421
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,544
- Let's hope we find him before Kerchak.
- Maybe he's lost.

422
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,672
- Or found something more interesting.
- Are you nuts?

423
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,966
What could be more interesting than us?

424
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:11,428
Hey, what's everybody looking at?

425
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,060
The horror!

426
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,021
It's gruesome. Hide me!

427
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:24,149
Pull yourself together.
You're embarrassing me.

428
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,152
These things aren't alive.

429
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:28,862
I knew that.

430
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,034
Hello?

431
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:40,040
What kind of primitive beasts
are responsible for this mess?

432
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:50,550
Come here, you guys!
Come here, come here!

433
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,552
- Look at this.
- What is that thing?

434
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,513
Funny.

435
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,939
Do it again, do it again.

436
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,732
Like this?

437
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,905
Rip it!

438
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,492
Ding! I love that part.

439
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,912
Let me hear it, big fella.

440
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,540
NOW, hit it!

441
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:29,214
Nice.

442
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,217
What the heck? Bye-bye.

443
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,552
Terk.

444
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:36,513
Yeah, Tant.

445
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,848
NOW, hit it.

446
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:40,225
Come on, Tantor.

447
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,311
I love it.

448
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,188
Stay with me, fellas.

449
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:48,692
I feel something happening here.

450
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,238
Gorillas!

451
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,915
He's one of them.

452
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:52,107
Oh, my...

453
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:34,149
Jane, where are you?

454
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:38,737
- Thank goodness.
- Good heavens, what happened?

455
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,197
Are you all right?
We've been everywhere.

456
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:42,449
Oh, my goodness.

457
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:45,368
Daddy, I was out walking...

458
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:48,037
- Yes, yes.
- Little baby. Little baby monkey.

459
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:49,581
- I drew a picture.
- Go on.

460
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,916
- The monkey starts crying.
- Poor baby.

461
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,794
I turned round,
and there's a whole fleet of them!

462
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,546
- Of what?
- An army of monkeys!

463
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,631
- A tree full of them...
- Monkeys?

464
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:00,300
...Screaming at me!

465
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:03,178
<i>Theropithecus baboonus.
She's very good at this.</i>

466
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,971
- Really?
- Terrified, I was.

467
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:08,349
Suddenly, I was swinging
in the vines, up in the air!

468
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,101
- With the monkeys?
- Flying.

469
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:12,353
- In the air.
- And I'm all surrounded.

470
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:15,398
- What did you do?
- And, Daddy, they took my boot!

471
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:18,193
- Those are the ones I bought you.
- And I was saved!

472
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:21,738
I was saved by a flying wild man
in a loincloth.

473
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,657
- Loincloth, good Lord.
- What is she talking about?

474
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:27,994
I haven't the foggiest idea.
Takes after her mother.

475
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:31,164
She'd come up with stories.
Not about men in loincloths...

476
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,416
- And there were gorillas!
- Gorillas?

477
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,337
- They were doing...
- You saw the gorillas? Where, Jane?

478
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,590
- He left with them.
- Who, dear, who?

479
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,884
Tarzan.

480
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,219
Tarzan?

481
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,471
The ape man.

482
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,685
Everyone. We will avoid the strangers.

483
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:55,271
Do not let them see you,
do not seek them out.

484
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,023
They mean us no harm, Kerchak.

485
00:46:57,106 --> 00:47:00,151
- I don't know them.
- I do. I've spent time with them.

486
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,821
You may be willing to risk our safety,
I'm not.

487
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:06,407
Why are you threatened
by anyone different from you?

488
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:13,039
Protect this family,
and stay away from them.

489
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,878
Tarzan, for once,
listen to Kerchak.

490
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:22,382
Why didn't you tell me there were
creatures that look like me?

491
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,518
Well, he didn't stand upright.
He sort of...

492
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:34,894
...crouched.
- Really?

493
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:37,105
He supported himself
on his knuckles.

494
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:40,108
- On the knuckles.
- See? Exactly like a gorilla.

495
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:43,069
- Extraordinary.
- It was amazing!

496
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:46,531
He'd bend his elbows like this.
And then he walks, like this.

497
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,742
Oh, I see! Like Aunt Isabel.

498
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,246
This is capital!

499
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,415
Janey-Jane, what a discovery!

500
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:58,042
A man with no language,
no human behaviour...

501
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,503
And no respect
for personal boundaries.

502
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,922
- How do you mean?
- He was this close, Daddy.

503
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:04,257
Staring at me.

504
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,594
He seemed confused at first,

505
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:10,263
as if he's never seen
another human before.

506
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:15,518
And his eyes were intense
and focused, and...

507
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,772
I've never seen such eyes.

508
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:26,279
Shall I leave you and the blackboard
alone for a moment?

509
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,323
Daddy, stop it.

510
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:33,161
The point is, think of what we could
learn from him. We must find him.

511
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,665
Professor, you are here
to find gorillas,

512
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:40,335
not indulge some girlish fantasy.

513
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:43,129
Fantasy? I didn't imagine him.

514
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,464
Tarzan is...

515
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,175
...real.

516
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,260
It's him!

517
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,554
It's him, it's him. Tarzan!

518
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,474
- Professor, Jane, stand back!
- Wait!

519
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,185
Clayton.

520
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,272
Clayton.

521
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:04,067
Have we met?

522
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:06,861
How does he know my name?

523
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:09,364
He thinks it means
the sound of a gunshot.

524
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:13,660
Yes. Hello, Tarzan.

525
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:16,412
I see what you mean
about personal boundaries.

526
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:18,665
What's he doing?

527
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,501
Look at him, Jane.

528
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,628
Moves like an ape,
looks like a man.

529
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,714
He could be the missing link.

530
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:30,468
Or our link to the gorillas.

531
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,012
Yes, yes.

532
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:36,140
Where are the gorillas?

533
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:41,270
Go-ri-llas!

534
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:44,983
Shouting won't help.
He doesn't understand English.

535
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,943
Then I'll make him understand.

536
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,821
If I can teach a parrot to sing
God Save the Queen,

537
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:53,866
I can certainly teach this savage
a thing or two.

538
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,869
Gorilla.

539
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:59,914
Gorilla.

540
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,583
- He's got it!
- Gorilla.

541
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,502
Go-ril-la.

542
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,628
Perhaps not.

543
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:11,467
Gimme that. Leave it.

544
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:14,804
Mr Clayton, I think
I'll take it from here.

545
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:28,026
<i>Whatever you do, I'll do it too</i>

546
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:32,280
<i>Show me everything and tell me how</i>

547
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,532
<i>It all means something</i>

548
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:38,077
<i>And yet nothing to me</i>

549
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:44,000
<i>I can see there's so much to learn</i>

550
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:48,296
<i>It's all so close
and yet so far</i>

551
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:51,841
<i>I see myself as people see me</i>

552
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:56,304
<i>Oh, I just know there's
something bigger out there</i>

553
00:50:56,387 --> 00:51:00,266
<i>I wanna know, can you show me</i>

554
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:04,270
<i>I wanna know about
these strangers like me</i>

555
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:08,232
<i>Tell me more, please show me</i>

556
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:13,529
<i>Something 's familiar about
these strangers like me</i>

557
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:24,415
<i>Every gesture,
every move that she makes</i>

558
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:28,377
<i>Makes me feel like never before</i>

559
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:34,217
<i>Why do I have this growing need
to be beside her</i>

560
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:39,722
<i>These emotions I never knew</i>

561
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:44,185
<i>Of some other world
far beyond this place</i>

562
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:47,939
<i>Beyond the trees,
above the clouds</i>

563
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:52,401
<i>I see before me a new horizon</i>

564
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:56,280
<i>I wanna know, can you show me</i>

565
00:51:56,364 --> 00:52:00,451
<i>I wanna know about
these strangers like me</i>

566
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:04,122
<i>Tell me more, please show me</i>

567
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:08,376
<i>Something 's familiar about
these strangers like me</i>

568
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,422
<i>Come with me now to see my world</i>

569
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:17,510
<i>Where there's beauty
beyond your dreams</i>

570
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:21,597
<i>Can you feel the things I feel</i>

571
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:25,893
<i>Right now, with you</i>

572
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,814
<i>Take my hand</i>

573
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:34,277
<i>There's a world I need to know</i>

574
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,297
We've wasted all this time
on what he wants.

575
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,426
The boat could arrive any day.
Now, ask him straight out.

576
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,349
Tarzan, will you take us
to the gorillas?

577
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:07,518
Do you understand?

578
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:09,729
I understand.

579
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,814
- Good work, Jane.
- Well?

580
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,192
- I can't.
- What?

581
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:17,528
- Why not, Tarzan?
- Kerchak.

582
00:53:56,943 --> 00:54:01,322
Oh, Terk, I've never seen him so happy.

583
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,449
Yeah? I give it a week.

584
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,122
- Aye, cut her loose!
- Come on, pull it down.

585
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:13,376
- All right, move it, ya bilge rats!
- Heave ho, lads.

586
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:14,710
Put your back in it.

587
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:17,296
- OK, move it.
- Wait. Please, don't...

588
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:21,300
I've waited 30 years for this
and I won't leave until I see a gorilla.

589
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:25,930
Isn't this dreadful, Tarzan?
No! No, no, wait!

590
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,182
Pick your barrel up.
Pick it up.

591
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:30,268
Here we go. Here we go.

592
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:31,978
You're the captain.

593
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:35,273
Say you've had engine trouble,
and give us two more days.

594
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:37,858
And be late at every port
from here to London?

595
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,485
We'll have come for nothing.

596
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:43,531
I'm sorry, Miss Porter,
but I simply can't do it.

597
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:45,908
This is your fault.

598
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:49,495
I should've followed my instincts
and set traps for the beasts.

599
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:52,581
Don't you think I'm disappointed
about the gorillas?

600
00:54:52,665 --> 00:54:54,834
You are absolutely impossible!

601
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:58,713
I was so afraid
you wouldn't come in time.

602
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,089
The boat's arrived.

603
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:03,259
The boat that's come to take us home,
to England.

604
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:07,763
And Daddy and I were...
Well, I was wondering...

605
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:10,891
Well, we really hope
that you'll come with us.

606
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,393
WON'T you?

607
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:16,814
Go see England today.
Come home tomorrow.

608
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:22,111
Well, see, it would be very difficult
to come back...

609
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,404
...ever.

610
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,031
Not come back?

611
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:29,118
I know it sounds awful,
but you belong with us, with people.

612
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,162
Jane must stay with Tarzan.

613
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,872
Stay here?

614
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:34,498
My laundry.

615
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:38,044
No, I can't stay.
Look, I've got...

616
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:40,463
I'm with my father, and...

617
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:43,924
Jane... stay.

618
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:46,677
- But...
- Please.

619
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:51,640
But, I can't.

620
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,978
Women.

621
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:58,898
How typical. Thank you, Jones.

622
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:02,985
Even if you hadn't grown up
a savage, you'd be lost.

623
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:06,572
There are no trails
through a woman's heart.

624
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:10,201
- Jane is going.
- Yes.

625
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:14,372
If only she could've spent
more time with the gorillas.

626
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,707
She's so disappointed.

627
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:19,377
Crushed, really.

628
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,213
Sorry, old boy.

629
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:26,175
Oh, well, I best get Jane's things
to the ship.

630
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:31,430
Clayton.

631
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,353
If Jane sees gorillas,
she stays?

632
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:41,148
Say, that's why she came, isn't it?

633
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,903
- I'll do it.
- Good man!

634
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,530
- Snipes?
- Sir?

635
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:52,284
Get the boys together.
There's gonna be a change in plans.

636
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:54,370
Terk, just get Kerchak out of the way.

637
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,414
- What?
- I'd be happy to get...

638
00:56:56,497 --> 00:57:00,084
Hey! Shut your trunk
and get me out of here.

639
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,420
Can you believe that guy?

640
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:05,965
Drops us like a newborn giraffe
kerplop!

641
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:09,468
Now Waltzes in here
and expects us to just...

642
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:12,221
Terk, I'm asking you as a friend.

643
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:17,685
With the face and the eyes
and the...

644
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:22,314
All right! But don't make me
do anything embarrassing.

645
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,025
I'm gonna kill him!!

646
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,446
I thought that dress
was rather slimming on you.

647
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:31,866
Really? I thought it was
a little revealing and kind of...

648
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,829
How does she move in this thing?

649
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,293
Look out!

650
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,862
- Look, Daddy!
- Where?

651
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:16,410
Now, be careful, professor.

652
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,162
Mustn't, mustn't frighten.

653
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,415
She's beautiful.

654
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:24,126
She's my mother.

655
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,129
This is your...

656
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,132
...mother?

657
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:43,521
- What's happening?
- I don't know, Daddy.

658
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:47,650
- It's getting away!
- No! You'll only frighten her more.

659
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,035
Yes, absolutely, my dear.
Good idea.

660
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,455
What are you doing?
Want to frighten them?

661
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,457
Get up. Get...

662
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:05,793
Don"E get Up-

663
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,158
Hello.

664
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:45,666
It's very nice to meet you, too.

665
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:53,048
Oh, Your Majesty,
you're such a tease.

666
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:55,926
Whoa! Hello. Hello.

667
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,637
Archimedes Q. Porter at your service.

668
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,599
Quite a grip you've got.

669
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,977
Thank you, yes.
Is that one of mine?

670
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,480
This is wonderful, Mr Clayton!

671
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:10,190
Look, look! Social grooming.

672
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:13,485
Congratulations, professor.

673
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:16,780
Our dream has come true.

674
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:21,994
Give me that!

675
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:24,496
What are you doing?
Now, stop that! Stop!

676
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:26,206
Hold on now. Leave that!

677
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,459
That is not to be played with!

678
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:44,642
Can you teach me?

679
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:47,978
- Speak gorilla?
- Yes.

680
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:12,920
Good heavens, what did I say?

681
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,173
That Jane stays with Tarzan.

682
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:19,677
Stay? But I, I thought we'd already...

683
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,137
Tarzan, I...

684
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:30,437
- Is that my dress?
- Oh, no.

685
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:35,401
Daddy.

686
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,739
Give it to me!

687
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,536
Go!

688
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:04,513
Go!

689
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,058
Wait, wait! Tarzan!

690
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:09,309
Go now!

691
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:12,688
Jane, quickly! Hurry!
Come along!

692
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:34,376
Kerchak, I didn't...

693
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:38,881
- I'm sorry, I...
- I asked you to protect our family.

694
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:42,634
And you betrayed us all.

695
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:13,165
I'm so confused.

696
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,294
<i>Come with me.</i>

697
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:20,714
There's something I should've
shown you long ago.

698
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:42,296
Is this me?

699
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:48,552
And this is my father,

700
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,137
and...

701
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,014
and my...

702
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,601
Now you know.

703
01:04:55,684 --> 01:05:00,022
Tarzan, I just want you to be happy,

704
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,858
whatever you decide.

705
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:55,243
No matter where I go,
you will always be my mother.

706
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:02,459
And you will always be in my heart.

707
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:24,439
Goodbye, Tarzan.

708
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:28,944
I'm so glad you found us in time.

709
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:43,166
We're too late!
I can't believe it!

710
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,044
If you had pulled over
and asked for directions...

711
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:48,130
We didn't get to say goodbye.

712
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:51,258
Well, good riddance, all right?
Who needs you, huh?

713
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:53,385
Go on, get out of here, bald boy!

714
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:56,304
You, you ingrate!
You bald ingrate!

715
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:58,390
Go on and rot, for all I care!

716
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,183
Go!

717
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,229
What are you looking at?

718
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:06,231
I'm gonna miss him, too.

719
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:17,576
Tarzan, you can't imagine
what's in store for you.

720
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,910
You'll see the world.

721
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:22,998
Everyone will want to meet you.
Kings, scientists, famous writers.

722
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:26,334
Yes. Darwin and Kipling.
Queen Victoria!

723
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:28,712
I haven't met her,
but I heard she's nice.

724
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,422
And I'll be with Jane?

725
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,385
Yes, with Jane.

726
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,638
Slipper)'-

727
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:04,581
Get him!

728
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,945
What's going on here?

729
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,405
Clayton! Clayton, help!

730
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,034
Have we met?

731
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:48,250
Yes, the ape man.

732
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,716
So sorry about the rude welcome,
old boy,

733
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,844
but I couldn't have you
making a scene

734
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:03,014
when we put your furry friends
in their cages.

735
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:04,599
Why?

736
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:06,309
Why?

737
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:09,146
For three hundred pounds sterling
a head.

738
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:12,691
Actually, I have you to thank, my boy.

739
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:15,819
Couldn't have done it without you.

740
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:20,198
Lock him up with the others.

741
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,580
That sounded like Tarzan.

742
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,999
He sounded like he was in trouble.

743
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:32,627
Well, why doesn't he get his new friends
to help him? I don't care.

744
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:35,964
That's it!

745
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:39,134
I've had it with you
and your emotional constipation!

746
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:42,053
Tarzan needs us
and we're gonna help him!

747
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:46,266
You got that?
Now, pipe down and hang on tight!

748
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,560
We've got a boat to catch.

749
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:00,780
I've never felt so alive!

750
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:03,575
Good! Cos I'm gonna kill you!

751
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:05,869
No time for that now, missy.

752
01:10:26,223 --> 01:10:28,308
Tarzan, it's no use. Don't!

753
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:39,736
- Clayton.
- Yes, Clayton.

754
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:43,990
Clayton betrayed us all.
I'm so sorry, Tarzan.

755
01:10:44,074 --> 01:10:46,701
No, I did this.

756
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:51,289
I betrayed my family.
Kerchak was right.

757
01:10:51,373 --> 01:10:56,169
Those magnificent creatures,
shivering in cages.

758
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:59,172
What is this world coming to?

759
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:07,722
Oh, by Jove!
Don't know my own strength.

760
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:14,187
What was that?

761
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:16,815
You are an animal!

762
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:20,652
That sounded just like an elephant.

763
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:21,987
Tantor!

764
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:24,739
Thanks, guys.

765
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:27,742
I thought I would never
see you again!

766
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:29,536
And here you are.

767
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:33,456
Sometimes you embarrass me.

768
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:43,860
I remember you.

769
01:12:45,487 --> 01:12:48,114
I think this one
will be better off stuffed.

770
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:11,846
You came back.

771
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,515
I came home.

772
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:30,323
Fire!

773
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,706
You! Take what you can
back to the boat.

774
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,166
Aye, aye, sir.

775
01:13:42,544 --> 01:13:45,046
I've got some hunting to do.

776
01:14:09,404 --> 01:14:10,530
Don't worry.

777
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:13,074
I'm going to have you
out of this in a second.

778
01:14:17,871 --> 01:14:19,914
This should do the trick.

779
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:44,731
Hiding, are we?

780
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,192
- Good!
- Clayton, you...

781
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:50,653
I could use a challenge.
Because after I get rid of you,

782
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:55,867
rounding up your little ape family
will be all too easy!

783
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,354
Go ahead, shoot me.

784
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:29,817
Be a man.

785
01:15:37,784 --> 01:15:39,410
Not a man like you!

786
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,487
Clayton, don't!

787
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:11,711
Kerchak, forgive me.

788
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:17,925
No, forgive me
for not understanding

789
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:22,305
that you have always
been one of us.

790
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:27,310
Our family will look to you now.

791
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:31,356
No, Kerchak.

792
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:33,191
Take care of them...

793
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:36,944
...my son.

794
01:17:45,495 --> 01:17:47,747
Take care of them.

795
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:12,623
London will seem so small
compared to all this.

796
01:19:12,707 --> 01:19:15,126
I will miss you, Jane.

797
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:19,213
- Miss Porter!
- I know. I'm coming.

798
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:24,886
Well... I suppose we
should say goodbye.

799
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,524
Goodbye.

800
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:51,579
Goodbye, Tarzan!
Goodbye.

801
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:54,290
I'm going to miss that boy.

802
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:07,762
Jane, dear, I can't help feeling
that you should stay.

803
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:10,306
Please don't.
We've been through this.

804
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,433
I couldn't possibly...

805
01:20:12,517 --> 01:20:16,979
I belong in England with you,
with people...

806
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:24,529
But you love him.

807
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:31,118
Go on.

808
01:20:56,519 --> 01:21:00,022
Thank you.
Thanks for getting my glove.

809
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:02,567
Thank you.

810
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,419
What am I doing?

811
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:24,755
Captain, tell them that you
never found us, eh?

812
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:28,467
After all, people get lost
in the jungle every day.

813
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:29,802
Tootle-pip.
