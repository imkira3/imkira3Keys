00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,640
Hi...

3
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,360
Yes um, I was wondering if
I could get driving directions...

4
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,000
To a nightclub called Bunker.

5
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,360
Yes, Bunker.

6
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,080
How exactly would I get there?

7
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,960
It's Amy!

8
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,880
Hello, sweetie!

9
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,720
Okay.

10
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,560
How are you?
We miss you so much!

11
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,680
Yeah, we wish you were
here with us.

12
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,640
- Mhm.
- Yeah.

13
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,440
And um, how far away is this?

14
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,240
No we're in Germany right now.

15
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,600
Mhm, and then we travel to Italy in a couple of days.

16
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Great.

17
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,560
Thanks.
Alvederzane!

18
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,760
I know.

19
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,840
Tell her we bought her a present from Holland.

20
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah we got you a present.

21
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,120
No we can't tell you what it
is, it's a surprise.

22
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,240
Oh yes, the other thing is that
we met this cute German waiter.

23
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,120
Well, Jenny thinks he's cute.

24
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,440
Mhm...

25
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,400
Yeah, and he invited us to this party
tonight, so...  We're gonna go.

26
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,680
But uh, we should go so...

27
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,520
Maybe we can talk to you later?

28
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,200
Okay.

29
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,720
All right.
We miss you!

30
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,240
Bye, Amy!
Kisses!

31
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,200
Okay.

32
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,800
Bye, sweetie!

33
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,240
I think we were supposed to turn.

34
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,120
Turn!?

35
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,200
I thought you knew exactly
where we were going!

36
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,360
Do we go left or right?

37
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm sorry, I just don't know
where we are.

38
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
What was that?

39
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,800
I have no idea.

40
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,680
You must have run over a pot hole or something.

41
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,520
We need to go out
and check it out.

42
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,480
Aww Shit!

43
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,120
Shit!

44
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,080
Shit! Shit, why oh God...

45
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,080
Why?
Oh my God!

46
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,440
Okay, okay um...

47
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,960
Okay.

48
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,440
We're gonna call the rental car service.
Get the papers.

49
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,040
Okay.

50
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,760
Okay.

51
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,640
Okay...

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
219...

53
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,320
200...

54
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,920
806.

55
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
What...

56
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,200
Shit, there's no signal.

57
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,200
What?

58
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,120
There's no signal!

59
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,320
There's always a signal.

60
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,760
Not out here in the middle of nowhere.

61
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,200
Oh my God, Shit!

62
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,120
Oh my God, oh my God, let's
just get back in the car.

63
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,080
Okay... Now what do we do?

64
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,520
I don't know!

65
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,600
Do you know how to change a tire?

66
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,120
- No, I don't know how to change a tire.
- Well, neither do I.

67
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,440
What are we supposed to just go walk
until we find a house or a person or something?

68
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,000
Lindsay... What are we supposed to just go walk
until we find a house or a person or something?

69
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,560
What are we supposed to just go walk
until we find a house or a person or something?

70
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,960
Lindsay. I am not getting out and walking.

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,560
Okay so we're just gonna sit here,
until the sun comes up?

72
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:24,800
I have heels and shorts on!
I'm not going outside!
Okay so we're just gonna sit here,
until the sun comes up?

73
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,960
I have heels and shorts on!
I'm not going outside!

74
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,440
Are those headlights?

75
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,840
Okay.
Roll down your window.

76
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,600
What, are you kidding!?
I'm not going to just roll down the window.

77
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,000
Roll down your window,
he can help!

78
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,200
- Hi...
- What's going on, girls?

79
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,840
Yeah um, we need help.

80
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,280
Uh... We have a flat tire.

81
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,280
I know you girls.

82
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,880
I've got a horny video
of you at home.

83
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
No... No, we speak English.

84
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,880
If um... Can you help us?

85
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,640
You're always wet
between your legs, right?

86
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't know what...  He's speaking German.

87
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,440
Um... Uh we need... Can you call somebody?

88
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,080
- I can do both of you at once.  I'll fuck you good and hard.
- Um... Uh we need... Can you call somebody?

89
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,960
- I can do both of you at once.  I'll fuck you good and hard.

90
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,480
Would you like that?

91
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,640
- "Ficken."
- Look it up.

92
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,680
Hold on a second.

93
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,640
Fucking!

94
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,480
He said fucking!

95
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,280
- Okay, okay, buh bye.
- Roll your window up.

96
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,880
Bye.

97
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,120
Do you want to fuck or not?

98
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,600
- I'm sorry.
- I told you!

99
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,800
Is your door locked?

100
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,320
Yes, my door is locked.

101
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,320
Why is he still staring at us?

102
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,040
- Just don't look at him, okay?
- I'm not looking at him.

103
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,120
- I just want to get out of here.
- I know.

104
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,520
Eww.

105
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,480
Aw!?

106
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,520
Oh my God.

107
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,200
Okay...

108
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,040
We, we need to j-just go! We need
to get out of here.

109
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,520
We need to walk and find someplace,
somebody that can help us, okay?

110
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,800
- Okay, but...
- We have to!

111
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,400
But if we don't find a place in like 10 minutes,
we are running back to this car.

112
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,320
We came...

113
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,520
We came from over here, I swear.

114
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,920
How do you know that?
All the trees look the same.

115
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,160
Leaving the car
is the stupidest idea.

116
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,480
We would have been waiting for hours, Jenny.

117
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,200
Yeah well we could have waited,
and it wouldn't have been freezing cold.

118
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,320
We needed to go find help, Jenny.

119
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,120
Seriously find help?
How are we going to find help out here, Lindsay?

120
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,920
Well, you agreed to come along, Jenny.
This is not just my fault.

121
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,800
I don't wanna stay in the car by myself!

122
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,400
We just got a little lost, okay?

123
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,000
- A little lost, Lindsay?
- Yes!
We just got a little lost, okay?

124
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,280
- A little lost, Lindsay?
- Yes!

125
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,280
We are not a little lost!

126
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,920
We're really lost!

127
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
You know what, Lindsay?
I'm not walking anymore!

128
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,080
I'm tired of walking, okay?

129
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,080
- Jenny, I'm trying!
- Trying what?

130
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,200
- Lindsay, we've been down here for like an hour okay!?
- Yeah I know!

131
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,400
I'm tired and I'm cold.
I'm not moving!

132
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,200
- I'm not moving!
- Stop it.

133
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,040
No!

134
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,280
- Fine!
- Fine!

135
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,120
Fine.

136
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,120
- I'm staying right here.
- Good.

137
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,240
What is that?

138
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,840
My God is that a...

139
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,600
Is that a house?

140
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,000
Jenny!

141
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,560
Jenny, look!

142
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,160
I think it's a house!
I swear!

143
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,160
- It's a, it's a light or something! Come on, let's go.
- What?

144
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,120
Quick...

145
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,560
Oh! For some reason I don't believe you!

146
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,200
Oh thank God!

147
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,760
Come on!

148
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,400
Hello!

149
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,880
Anybody home?

150
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,400
Let's go to the front door!

151
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,000
Hello!

152
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,320
-Hello?
-Lindsay!

153
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,120
Lindsay, come here... To the door!

154
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,240
- Oh my God!
- What?

155
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,200
Look at the dog!

156
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,120
I know and I don't like dogs!

157
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,440
I know you don't.

158
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,040
- Hello?
- Is anybody home?

159
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,520
- Keep ringing the doorbell.
- Do you see anybody?

160
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,600
No...  Oh wait, yes!

161
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,640
Hi.

162
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

163
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,040
We got a flat tire.

164
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,120
Can we come in?

165
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,400
Can we use your phone so we
can call the car company service?

166
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,800
Are you alone?

167
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,480
Yes.

168
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,840
We're alone.

169
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,480
Come in.

170
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,760
Have a seat.

171
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,400
You're tourists?

172
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,000
- Um, we-we're on a road trip through Europe...
- It's like a... Yeah... A European vacation.

173
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,920
We're from New York.

174
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Can you call the emergency car service?

175
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,000
For us?

176
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,120
Are you relatives?

177
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,120
- No.
- No, we're friends.

178
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,120
Anyway...

179
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,040
I'll make the phone call.

180
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,640
Okay, thanks.

181
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,040
Something to drink?

182
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,640
- Uh, water is fine.
- Yeah, just... Water.

183
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,120
Hello.

184
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,200
This is Dr. Heiter.

185
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,280
Sorry to call you so late.

186
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,040
But there's a problem. I've got two girls from New York.
They're having car trouble.

187
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,240
Well...

188
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,400
At least he's calling the car company for us.

189
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,640
That's just great.

190
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,720
Yes, thanks a lot.

191
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,760
Bye.

192
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,040
Here you go...

193
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,760
Water.

194
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,560
Thank you.

195
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,640
Water.

196
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,040
They will arrive in half an hour.

197
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,280
Maximum.

198
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,120
You have a really lovely home.

199
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,640
Do you live here with your wife?

200
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,400
No.

201
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,080
I don't like human beings.

202
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,480
God damn it! Be careful, will you!? Stupid cow!

203
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,800
I'm sorry.

204
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,600
Is there something wrong
with your eyes? Idiot.

205
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,920
I'll get you another one.

206
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,120
- No, it's okay, I... It's okay.
- We can just share.

207
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,080
I'll fetch a towel.

208
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,960
What just happened?

209
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,920
I don't know.

210
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
We need to get out of here right now.

211
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,800
Okay.

212
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,240
It's freaking me out.

213
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,560
We need to just... Call a taxi or something
so we can go back to the hotel.

214
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,360
Straight go back to the hotel, okay.

215
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,680
- Okay.
- We'll get the car in the morning or something.
- Okay. Yeah.

216
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm really tired.

217
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,000
Listen, um, If you could just call a taxi service for us,
we're just gonna go back to the hotel.

218
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,520
No. I don't do another phone call.

219
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,560
Can I call then?

220
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,640
No.

221
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,280
- I'm tired.
- What?

222
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,760
- I'm tired.
- What uh...

223
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,240
What's going on?
Look at me.

224
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,160
It's a rape drug.

225
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,200
- What!?
- Rohypnol.

226
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,680
Oh my God! What!?

227
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,760
It causes drowsiness, dizziness,
disorientation and memory loss.

228
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,400
Wha... Are you kidding!?
What are you doing to h...

229
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Jenny!
Oh my God!

230
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,280
What is it?

231
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,880
Oh my God.

232
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,440
Jenny.

233
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Jenny.

234
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,000
Jenny!

235
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,120
Jenny!
Jenny, wake up!

236
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,400
Jenny!

237
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,640
Oh my God!

238
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,640
Jenny.

239
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,840
Lindsay!

240
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,320
Jenny!

241
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,320
What is going on!?

242
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,760
What are you doing?

243
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,600
What is this?

244
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,440
What the fuck are you doing to us?

245
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,800
What are you doing?

246
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,800
Jenny!

247
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Get us ou...

248
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,000
My friend...

249
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,840
You don't match.

250
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,320
... Have to kill you.

251
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,400
Don't take it personally.

252
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,920
What is this?
What are you doing to us?

253
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,840
What is this?
Stop!

254
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,640
Jenny!

255
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,040
Who the fuck are you?
Where the fuck am I?

256
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,040
What is this?

257
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,240
Answer me, what is this!?

258
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,840
Untie me, God damn it!

259
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,880
What are you doing?
Why the fuck did you tie me up?

260
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,800
God damn it, untie me you freak!

261
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,400
Who the fuck are you?

262
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,160
Please...

263
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,080
Why the fuck are you doing this!?
Why are you doing this!?

264
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,680
Where the fuck are you going?

265
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,880
It's gonna be okay... Likely good.

266
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,920
The Japanese possess unbelievable strength
when backed into a corner.

267
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,800
The Japanese possess incredible strength
when backed into a corner.

268
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,760
What...

269
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,800
What are you going to do with us?

270
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,560
I'm Dr. Joseph Heiter.

271
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:21,000
Retired but still very well known as
the leading surgeon separating Siamese twins.

272
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,240
You're a crazy Nazi.

273
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,600
I'll get you, you dirty German madman.
Just you wait and see.

274
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Six months ago...
I'll get you, you dirty German madman.
Just you wait and see.

275
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,400
I designed a never seen operation,
not separating anymore but creating.

276
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:40,720
I transformed my three Rottweilers
into a beautiful... Three-hound construction.

277
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Good news!

278
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,280
Your tissues match.

279
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,480
So...

280
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,280
- I will explain this spectacular operation only once.
- Your knots won't hold me forever!

281
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,280
We start...

282
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,080
With cutting the ligament patellar.

283
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,080
The ligaments of the knee caps.

284
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,520
So knee extension...

285
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,760
Is no longer possible.

286
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,880
Pulling from "B" and "C"...

287
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,000
The central incisors,
lateral incisors and canines...

288
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,120
From the upper and lower jaws...

289
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,880
Shut your mouth and untie me!

290
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,800
The lips from "B" and "C"...

291
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,640
And the anus of "A" and "B"...

292
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,680
Are cut circular along the border
between skin and mucosa.

293
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,040
The mucus retains so.

294
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,320
Two paracellular grafts
are prepared...

295
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,280
And lifted from the underlining tissue.

296
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,800
- Just you wait until I get my hands on you.
- The shape incisions...

297
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,000
Below the chins of "B" to "C"...

298
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,080
Up to their cheeks...

299
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,640
Connecting the circular mucosa and skin parts...

300
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,160
Of anus and mouth.

301
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,080
From "A" to "B"... And "B" to "C".

302
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,000
Connecting...

303
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,040
The paracellulated grafts to the chin-cheek incisions.
From "A" to "B" and "B" to "C".

304
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,480
What are you babbling about?
The paracellulated grafts to the chin-cheek incisions.
From "A" to "B" and "B" to "C".

305
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,800
The paracellulated grafts to the chin-cheek incisions.
From "A" to "B" and "B" to "C".

306
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,720
You really think
you'll get away with this?
The paracellulated grafts to the chin-cheek incisions.
From "A" to "B" and "B" to "C".

307
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,040
You really think
you'll get away with this?

308
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,960
Creating...

309
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,560
A Siamese triplet.

310
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,360
Connected...

311
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,360
Via the gastric system.

312
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,440
Ingestion by "A"...

313
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Passing through "B"...

314
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,200
And the excretion of "C".

315
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,720
A human centipede.

316
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,520
First sequence.

317
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,520
Here's your breakfast.

318
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,480
- Hey, hey, just a minute, just a minute. Just, just, just a minute...
- Propofol... Under general anesthesia.

319
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,800
Please stop!

320
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,560
No! No!

321
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,760
Lindsay!

322
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,040
Lindsay!

323
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,240
Jenny...

324
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,920
Lindsay!

325
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,600
I want my mom!

326
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,920
Have you gone mad?

327
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,200
Come here! Come back here!

328
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,120
No!

329
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,040
Oh No!

330
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,800
Open up!

331
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,840
Please!

332
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,120
Stop!
Why are you doing this?

333
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,960
Open up!

334
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,520
You need help,
you're a sick man!

335
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,240
I am a sick man...

336
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,360
If you don't open up immediately I will...

337
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,920
Cut your knees...

338
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,160
And pull your teeth out
one by one!

339
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,440
Without any anesthesia.

340
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,400
It's your choice!

341
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,880
Open the door!

342
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,600
Open that door!

343
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,320
Stop it!

344
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,240
No, oh God!

345
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,040
No, oh God!

346
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,760
No, oh God!

347
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,200
No! No!

348
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,000
Please!
Please!

349
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,240
Why you doing this just...

350
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,240
Let me and Jenny go!

351
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,480
Please!

352
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,920
We'll give you anything!

353
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,040
Anything you want,
just let us go!

354
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,160
Don't worry...

355
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,400
It's only a sedation rifle.

356
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,760
Keep your head very still.

357
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,200
I don't want to lose one of your precious eyes.

358
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,040
Just kill me!

359
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,200
Ahh...

360
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,760
One of my Rottweilers,
also tried to escape...

361
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,320
Just before the operation.

362
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,760
After I caught the dog...

363
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,280
He had to take the middle position.

364
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,080
In this position...

365
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,880
The healing pains...

366
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,200
Are twice as intense.

367
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,800
Do you already regret your little escape?

368
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,200
In fact, I'm thankful for it.

369
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:43,000
Because now, I know definitely,
you are...

370
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,080
the middle piece!

371
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,880
Just kill me now.
I'd rather be dead.

372
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,560
Game... Over.

373
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,080
Ah shit...

374
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,160
The power is cut off again.

375
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,920
Sorry!

376
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,320
Shit!

377
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,560
Who the fuck runs the electricity around here!?

378
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,400
I'm so sorry.

379
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,680
Help!

380
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,560
Oh my sweet centipede...

381
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,200
Good boy.

382
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,080
Looks good.

383
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,960
Healing well.

384
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,640
Suffering will be over soon.

385
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,440
You're in a lot of pain, I know.

386
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,800
Yeah... Nice.

387
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,760
Okay.

388
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,040
Better and better.

389
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,440
You're... My lead.

390
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,440
My lead.

391
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,600
Hey man...

392
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,120
Hey man...

393
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,240
Yeah... Come...

394
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,120
Come on up.

395
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,160
Stand up.

396
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,040
You can do it... Yeah, yeah...

397
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,880
Up... Yeah...

398
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,200
Yeah come... Come up!
Up... Up! Up! Up! Up!

399
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,440
Doing well, yeah!
Yeah, come up!

400
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,040
Here... Come up. Ah, yeah!
Yeah!

401
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,880
Yeah! Very good!
Yeah!

402
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,800
I did it!

403
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,440
Do you really think
you're God?

404
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,440
Make it all go away, please.

405
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:59,080
Stop this.
Stop it now. Turn it off!

406
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,840
How dare you lock us up here?
You crazy idiot.

407
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,120
You'll regret this,
you filthy asshole.

408
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,320
European madman.
Goddammit, let us out!

409
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,720
Now! We are not animals... To be caged!

410
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,320
Take the world... And bring it to me.

411
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,680
Yeah, good boy.

412
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,400
Come...

413
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,160
Come!

414
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,840
Bring the bait...

415
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,840
I am not a dog you madman.

416
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,120
Good boy.

417
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,000
Come!

418
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,800
Yeah come!

419
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:21,000
- Then let's walk a little bit at least.
- Now what?

420
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,720
Attention!

421
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,800
What the hell are you doing?

422
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,880
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four. One, two...

423
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,680
Just die!

424
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,960
Bon appétit.

425
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,200
That's what you get.
I'm not your goddamn dog.

426
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,880
I'm not a dog.

427
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,400
Do this once more again to me...

428
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,240
And I'll pull your teeth out
one by one.

429
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,320
You kamikaze shit hole.

430
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,680
You want to bite me?

431
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,200
Now you can bite me.

432
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,800
Bite my boot.

433
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,320
Bite my boot!

434
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,600
Bite my boots!

435
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:44,680
Oh... Mr. Kamikaze is a chicken today.

436
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,080
Do you get off on this?
This is your fetish.

437
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,360
How dare you,
to turn your back to me?

438
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,120
I'll give you some educa...

439
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,600
Oh no...

440
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,400
Shit.

441
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,440
I have to shit.
I have to shit.

442
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,200
Forgive me.

443
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,640
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

444
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,520
Feed her!
Feed her!

445
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,360
Hard!
Swallow it bitch!

446
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,280
Swap!

447
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,320
Feed her!
Feed her!

448
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,360
Hard!

449
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,800
I wanna sleep...

450
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,880
I have to sleep!

451
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,480
Why didn't I cut your vocal cords...

452
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,960
If you don't shut up...

453
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,520
We'll catch up on it.

454
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,240
... Doing a follow-up operation.

455
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,120
Finally! You wanna move your ass.

456
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,240
That's fine with me.

457
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,160
Maybe... You even can escape.

458
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,280
Speed up, come!
Come!

459
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,840
After you, please.

460
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:44,920
I'll teach you... To mind me!

461
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,960
Strong...

462
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,520
Good.

463
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,480
Constipated...

464
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,280
Laxative.

465
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,000
I'll use mine,
good stuff.

466
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,840
End section, you are very sick.

467
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,720
I think you're dying...

468
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,640
May have to replace you.

469
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,400
- Help us! Help...
- Shut up!

470
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,760
Yes, hello?

471
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,960
This is the police. We want to talk to you.

472
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,600
One minute...

473
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,400
Help us! Please, anyone!
We're in the cellar!

474
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:36,920
Hello...

475
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,440
Mr. Heiter... Good day.

476
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,840
Police...

477
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,960
This is my colleague Voller.

478
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,560
And I'm Detective Kranz.

479
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,000
May we come in a moment?

480
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,520
Of course.

481
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,480
Come in.

482
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,400
Thank you.

483
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,760
Take a seat.

484
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,240
How can I help you?

485
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,920
Mr. Heiter, people are missing.

486
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,080
Their vehicles were found
in your neighborhood.

487
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,680
Perhaps you could tell us more...

488
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,520
I'm afraid you've come
to the wrong house, you see...

489
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,960
I'm so busy at the moment
with my research and writing...

490
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,120
That I hardly leave the house.

491
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:03,000
Gentlemen... Can I offer you something
to drink?

492
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,680
Coffee, if you have any.

493
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,960
I'm afraid I don't have time
for coffee.

494
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,720
Water is all I have.

495
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,480
Mr. Kranz...

496
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,840
Thank you.

497
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,160
Mr. Voller...

498
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,080
So tell me,
what do you want to know?

499
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:24,200
Mr. Heiter, we know you're an international first-rate surgeon
and we don't want to disturb you...

500
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,080
But our investigation has hit a dead end.

501
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,920
And, you're a suspect.

502
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,160
I expect you have
your reasons.

503
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:39,000
But I have neither the time,
nor the patience...

504
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,040
For the banality
of missing persons.

505
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,640
What is that cage
being used for?

506
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,280
Could you get to the point?

507
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:53,040
A witness... Heard a woman...
Screaming on your property.

508
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,880
An American woman.
Can you explain that?

509
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,720
Absolutely not.

510
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,800
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

511
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:11,160
Your silver-colored Mercedes was seen, at the
place where the abandoned Dutch truck was found.

512
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,080
What do you think?

513
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,880
You think there's a connection!?
Oh the nerve you guys have to suspect me!

514
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,800
Finish your drinks
and get out of my house!

515
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,560
I need you out of my house... I have work to do!

516
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,680
Take it!

517
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,840
Come on.
I need you out!

518
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:40,120
Take it! Drink up!

519
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,280
You will regret that!

520
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,720
I'll see you in court.

521
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:59,840
You can count on being fired
when my lawyer hears about this.

522
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,520
My apologies.

523
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,880
I overreacted.

524
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,480
I'm overworked.

525
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,440
I don't get enough sleep.

526
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,800
I'll just get a towel.

527
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:43,320
Help us! We're in the cellar!
Come to the cellar! Help us!

528
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:55,480
Dear Joseph,
don't stress yourself.

529
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,480
Everything will be okay.

530
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:04,840
I've got two strong and healthy replacements.

531
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,040
So enjoy...

532
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,640
Your last moments with the "Jen-tail."

533
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:19,360
Because when I'm back,
I'll mercy kill it.

534
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,920
... Preparing for a new operation...

535
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,920
... A quadruplet!

536
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,520
See you.

537
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,320
Come...

538
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,680
What is down there... In that cellar?

539
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Now... You're going too far.

540
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,800
Well what's in there?

541
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,040
My laboratory, a small workroom,
and a torture chamber.

542
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,080
You're making a fool of yourself.

543
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,920
Can we take a look around?

544
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,760
Not a chance.

545
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:08,000
Look... My research is off-limits
to you... To everyone.

546
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,160
Do you have a search warrant?

547
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,680
I can have one in 15 minutes.

548
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,600
I'll ask you again:
What's in the cellar?

549
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,040
What you're doing is illegal,
as you no doubt are aware.

550
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,040
Shall I call the police
myself and tell them?

551
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:27,080
When you show me a warrant,
you may search my entire home.

552
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,440
... And what is this?

553
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,600
That...

554
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,360
Insulin.

555
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,160
I have diabetes mellitus.

556
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,200
We'll be back in 20 minutes
with a search warrant.

557
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,200
I think you're hiding something.

558
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,640
If you want to waste
the taxpayers' money...

559
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,240
That's your call.

560
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,480
See you soon.

561
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,840
Fuck you!

562
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,240
We have to get out of here!

563
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,360
One, two!

564
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,080
Okay?

565
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,840
One, two, one!
Come on!

566
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,160
Two!

567
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,480
One!

568
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,440
Two!

569
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,720
One!

570
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,160
Two!

571
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,800
One!

572
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,080
Two!
Come on!

573
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,440
One!

574
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,120
Two!

575
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,960
One!

576
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,280
Two!

577
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,000
One!

578
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,840
Two!

579
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,400
One!

580
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,200
Two!

581
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,320
One!

582
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,280
Two!

583
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,840
One!

584
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,880
Two!

585
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,640
One!

586
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,040
Two!

587
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,360
One!

588
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,000
One more... One!

589
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,600
Two!

590
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,320
One!

591
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,080
Two!

592
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,680
One...

593
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,440
One!

594
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,600
Two!

595
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,320
One!

596
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,160
Two!

597
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:42,480
One!

598
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,360
Two!

599
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,440
One!

600
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,800
Two!

601
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,160
One!

602
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,080
Come on! Almost there!
Come on, almost there!

603
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:01,960
Come on!

604
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,600
One!

605
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,280
Two!

606
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,160
One!

607
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,040
Two!

608
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,040
One!

609
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,960
Two! Almost there!

610
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,880
One!

611
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:23,800
Two! Almost there, faster!

612
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,680
One!

613
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,240
Two!

614
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,440
Why here? Why are we in this room?

615
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,680
Goddamn!

616
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,560
Goddammit!

617
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,240
Now what?

618
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:56,360
... Eye for eye...

619
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,560
... Tooth for tooth...

620
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,880
Hey God...

621
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,440
Are you God?

622
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,240
I'm just...

623
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,320
I'm just a puny insect.

624
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:06,680
I cast out my parents...
Left my child without a parent.

625
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,560
I dismissed their love
and led a selfish life...

626
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,080
... Just like an insect.

627
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,040
In fact, lower than an insect.

628
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,200
But...

629
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,840
But dear God...

630
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,000
That's how I've lived my life!

631
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,680
And this is my punishment for living my life how I did!

632
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,760
I'm just...

633
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,200
... Trying to believe...

634
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,920
... That I'm still a human being.

635
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,640
Hey girls...

636
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,480
Hey look, it's God...

637
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,400
What a fucked up world we're living in.

638
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,720
Police!

639
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,440
Dr. Heiter, police!

640
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,000
Dr. Heiter...

641
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,960
Well, Goddamn it...

641
01:21:19,305 --> 01:22:19,378
