We need immediate backup!

322
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,753
Make sure that gate is bolted.

323
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,074
Shotgun!

324
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,757
- Where are the shells?
- They're in the bag.

325
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,592

Are you kidding me?

330
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,555
You send us on a highway

331
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,830
with the most dangerous criminal
on the planet,

332
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,353
and you don't load the shotgun!

(HORN BLOWING)

334
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,111
We got bogies on the bus.

00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,856
- Let's light 'em up.
- Okay. Hit the button.

336
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,155
What button? What button?
There are a million buttons.

337
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,280
- Number three. Number three.
- Three, three, three.

338
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
- Oh!
- (ALL EXCLAIMING)

Mikey, clear our right flank.

Nunchuks giganticus. Whoa!

- Those things are pretty awesome, huh?

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,591
Yeah, pretty awesome!

Eh...

346
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,716
Get them out of there!
Eliminate those turtles!

I don't like those guys.

I'm not being used
to my full potential here, Leo.

Get him to the extraction point.

Oh...

364
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,276
We are two miles from Exit 14.
Set up an intercept.

- What is that thing?
- It's a big-ass magnet.

Yeah!

If Sensei Shredder
can't make it to the extraction point,

380

then we bring the extraction point to him.

Hi.

(SCREAMS)

386
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,077
Okay. It's all you, Mikey.

387
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,593
Time to shine.

388
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
Ow! Ow!

I'm sorry!

- Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

This is awesome!

393
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,416
We have to teleport Shredder earlier.

394

KARAI: But you said...

395
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,234
Yes, that that would be
irresponsibly dangerous. True.

396
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,280
All right, Donnie,
you've got to get Mikey closer.

Take the shot, Mikey!

(GRUNTS)

404
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,593
Where'd he go?

405
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,039
It worked!

406
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,789
But... Shredder's location unknown?

407
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
(GROANING)

408
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,835
Where am I?

409
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,992
Does it matter?

410
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,275
I know what you're thinking right now.

411
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,352
Of all the ways you'd like to kill me.

412
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,193
But that would require
you outthinking me.

413
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,353
And no one, no thing
is smarter than the Krang!

414
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,959
Oh, I'm sorry.

415
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,033
Did I get a little tentacle mucus
in your eyes, Shredder?

416
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,080
So you know my name.

417
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,071
Why am I here?

418
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,435
Because you
and your buddy Dr. Stockman

419
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,909
found something of mine.

420
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,036
The teleportation device.

421
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,391
The teleport was
supposed to break me out of prison.

422
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,958
(LAUGHS) But it is capable
of so much more.

423
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,871
That device is part of a machine

424
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,837
called the arc capacitor.

425
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,791
Years ago, I launched
the arc capacitor to Earth's dimension.

426
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,110
But upon entering your atmosphere,

427
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,509
it broke apart into three pieces.

428
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,550
You and Stockman have one piece.

429
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,275
Another is in a museum in New York.

430
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,238
The third is in the Brazilian rainforest.

431
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,392
Collect the other two pieces.

432
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,391
Dr. Stockman should
be inventive enough

433
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,075
to reassemble the arc capacitor.

434
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,559
SHREDDER: And then what?

435
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,959
KRANG: It will open a portal

436
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,031
through which
I can bring my war machine,

437
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,918
the Technodrome, to Earth.

438
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,350
Together, we can bring
the people of your planet to their knees.

439
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,439
I'm interested.

440
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,360
I will help you take down planet Earth

441
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,954
if you help me with my problem.

442
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,957
Four brothers will try to stop me.

443
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,559
Turtles.

444
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,676
I'm aware of your past.

445
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,632
Take this.

446
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,872
It will solve
all your problems with those pests.

447
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,115
I'll see you on the other side.

448
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
(GRUNTING)

449
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,157
Push me back in! (GRUNTING)

450
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,996
Push me in, you stupid robot.

451
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
(GRUNTS)

452
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,119
More!

453
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,199
You idiot!

454
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,616
APRIL: Okay, so he just vanished?

455
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,760
DONATELLO: Wait, wait, wait.

456
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,440
If I run the video
from my shoulder camera

457
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,616
through an electrostatic filter,

458
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,313
we might be able to see
what happened to Shredder.

459
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,197
Come on. Show me something, buddy.

460
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,633
Look! Right there!

461
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,276
It appears to be some kind of
residue from a teleportation event.

462
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,876
Yeah, teleportation event residue, man.
It's the worst.

463
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,155
Does that kind of technology even exist?

464
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,800
Baxter Stockman's been
working on this kind of tech for years.

465
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,576
All of that stuff
that I pulled off of his iPad,

466
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,816
it was full of information
about Shredder and the Foot Clan.

467
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,080
It was like a virtual playbook!

468
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,995
Baxter has to have a backup.
And I bet it's on the mainframe at TCRI.

469
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,919
Donnie, I need something.
What do you got?

470
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,194
Wait.

471
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,080
I know exactly what you need.

472
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,148
Totally plug-and-play.

473
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,436
Perfect. I'll go check it out.

474
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,357
We'll go with. Operate in support.

475
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,199
Wait.

476
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,433
The sun's coming up.

477
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,593
You can't go outside. You'll be seen.

- No, no, no.

01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,376
LOBBY OFFICER 2:
Show me your hands!

1127
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,550
- LOBBY OFFICER 3: Hold it!
- Freeze right there!

1128
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,896
LOBBY OFFICER:
Don't move! We will shoot!

1129
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,816
- Get down on the ground.
- Wait! We're the good guys!

1130
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,115
- Get on the ground!
- All right, okay.

1131
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,078
What are those things?

1132
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,273
They're monsters.

They're monsters!

No! No! No! Don't shoot!

- Stop it! No, don't!
- Don't shoot, don't shoot.

1137

Go.

1138
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,313
Go now!

1139
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,276
Get to the ground slowly. Get down!

1140
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,832
Jones, you've got to be kidding me.

1141

stays in the department.

It is all over the police scanner,
they are hunting you.

- What happened up there?
- Tell him, Raph.

1146
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,216
Tell him how you broke rank
and got us all exposed.

1147

For the most selfish reason.

There's no scenario
where you wouldn't get caught.

1152

Maybe if you hadn't lied
to your own flesh and blood...

1153

Oh, wait. The way you lied to April?

They weren't just scared.

1158
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,833
There was

1159
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,679
actual hate.

But Raph, he never hears
a word I have to say.

1166

Now, I knew they couldn't
handle the truth about the purple ooze,

they proved me right.

Raph's brains are in his biceps,

1171
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,192
and Mikey's head's in the clouds!

1172

I can't get them all on the same page.

To think with one mind.

1174
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,597
You shouldn't want them all
to think the same.

1175
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,280
It's their different points of view
that make the team strong.

1176

A good leader understands this.

1177

They're at 36,000 feet,
traveling at 490 knots.

1192
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,120
The only real monster
in this city is Shredder

1193
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,720
and the two mutants that he's created.

Bebop and Rocksteady.

If you think anything
coming out of your mouth

1196
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,479
is gonna add to her credibility,
you are sorely mistaken.

1197
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,074
Shredder mutated them
with the help of Baxter Stockman.

That's actually who you need to go see.

It's been edited.

Well, I hate to break it to you,
