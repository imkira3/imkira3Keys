1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,644
Hide! Quickly!

3
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,896
Run away!

Back! This way.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,082
Quick! This way!

6

Quickly! Come on!

7
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,265
Down to the lake!

8
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,275
Oh.

9
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:29,037
- M for Mischa.
- Mischa.

10
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,464
Come on! Come on, let's go!

11
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,012
Come on, Lothar.

12

- Hurry now. Give me the bathtub.
- Yes, sir.

13
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,986
Hannibal! Mischa!
Where have you been?

14
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,648
Hurry now. Quickly!

15
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,239
Hannibal! Come here.

16
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,289
Come on.

17
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:14,173
Darling, the cart is packed.
Everything is ready.

18
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,091
Hurry up. Come on, come on.

19
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,131
Come on, old boy! Come on!

20
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:26,519
Hey! Colonel Timka says
the fighting will be close to the roads.

21
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,273
It can't last more than a few days.
We'll be safe at the lodge.

22
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:35,528
Come on! We're almost there!

23
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:43,532
No, no, no. The bath
has to be for the dirty clothes.

24
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,367
- In you come.
- Let's see if our toys are there.

25
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,407
- Ah. Hand me the bath.
- I'll take it.

26
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,950
No, it's fine.

27
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,871
Let's hurry. Cook will have packed
the kitchen by the time you get back.

28
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,381
Ah!

Mischa.

Hannibal, give them here. Mama's pearls.

32
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,017
Ah! Oh!

33
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,737
Pearls before swine.

34
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,402
Mischa, blow.

35
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,452
Ah!

36
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,459
Shut up. Shut up!

37
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,014
You are a Jew.
How could I eat your cooking?

38
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,270
Dispose of him.

39
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,188
How do you deal with locals,
being locals yourself?

40
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,854
You say you want to be 88.
Let's see you earn it.

41
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,029
Kill the Jew. Bring me the peasant.

00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,416
Move, you fat fucking Jew. Move! Move!

44
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,885
Are you a Gypsy?

45

No, sir.

00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,315
Are you a Jew?

No, sir.

48
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,945
Good job!

49
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,199
Why don't you show us your dick?

50
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,956
Major! Russian tanks moving west!

51
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:38,119
Put all their food on the trucks.
Move it!

52
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,057
This forest was full of game.

53
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,093
This war.

54
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,891
Find us something to eat.

55
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,533
Which way home, Hannibal?

56
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,582
Good boy.

57
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,044
The Germans are falling back
from Leningrad.

58
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,508
They are in full retreat.

And starving.

What's that?

62
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,246
- It's a Russian tank.
- Get away from the window!

63
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,335
Lothar! Russians!

64
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,846
Everybody out of the house!

65
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,363
We only want water.
The children can stay in the warm.

66
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,908
- Get them inside.
- Go, Hannibal. Look after her.

67
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,579
- Mischa, come here.
- Start the pump.

68
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,218
Wait here.

Shh!

71
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,690
- How much longer?
- A few minutes.

72
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:17,365

00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,122
Get down!

No, Mischa, go back!

- Hurry!

Come on! Get in the back.
Put it in the back.

Start the engine. Start the engine.

92

- Relax. We're getting rich.

- Hurry, shut the door!
- Grutas, isn't that the 88 major?

95
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,332
Major. "Kill a few Gypsies," you said.

96
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,877
"Kill a few Jews,
and we'll make you 88."

97
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,012
If you had kept your word,

I would be saying

Get the radio, Kolnas.

Wait. I have found something
on the Russian frequency. Shh.

Roadblocks. Every five kilometre
from here to Vilnius.

132

So we are stuck for now, hm?

133
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,726
Once, we were Lithuanians.

134
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,235
Now we are Russians.

135
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,317
We were Germans before.

136
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,325
Medics. Police.

137
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,782
And what are we at this moment.

138
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,995
At this moment, we are starving.

- Get something?
- It's freezing.

Open it.

141
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:12,086
You think these are peppercorns?
These are frozen maggots.

142

Let's hear you, little master.

- He's mute.
- He's not mute at night.

He can scream well enough,
and he'll sing.

This is not
your father's house any more.

151

It must be difficult for you
to live in this house.

Get up!

Now scream all you please.

165
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,963
Every day you'll pay for this.

166

Every day for the rest
of your short and nasty life.

167
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,969
Lecter!

168
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,139
He's not here.

169
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,971
This way.

170
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,102
Ah!

171
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,434
Oh! Ah!

172
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,385
Shh. Shh.

173
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:52,309
Who's there?
Some help you are. Shoo! Go!

174
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,862
- What is it, Serge?
- A boy, Madame.

175
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,823
He has pictures of you and your husband.

176
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,650
Your uncle would have loved to see you.

177
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:45,320
It has been almost a year since he died.

178
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,750
Only you and I are left now.

179
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,725
Mischa.

180
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,275
Mischa.

181
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,454
Mischa!

182
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,953
Mischa! Mischa!

183
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:36,287
- Mischa! Mischa!
- Hannibal!

184
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,206
- Mischa!
- Hannibal!

185
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,499
Hannibal, wake up!

186
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,385
It's all right. It's all right.

187
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,884
When you sleep, do you remember?

188
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,805
Do you remember
what happened to Mischa?

189
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,591
You look like your uncle, Hannibal.

190
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,383
Would you like to try? Use this.

191
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,285
Hannibal!

192
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,159
Speak to me.

193
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,578
Thank you.

194
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,769
Hannibal!

195
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:57,534
Here is where I pray to my ancestors
for strength, for courage.

196
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:06,296
I have the honour
only on my ancestor's birthday

197
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:11,051
to polish his armour with oil of Cloves.

198
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:29,604
This is after the fight
for Osaka Castle.

199
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,372
The samurai display
the heads of their enemies.

200
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,912
There are more suitable parchments
that will interest you.

201
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:54,003
Be gentle, Hannibal, and be brave,

202
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,263
like your father.

203
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,434
And like him.

204
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:13,527
You must be ready for anything. Come!

205
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,199
Again.

206
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,033
Again.

207
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,465
Good. Again!

208
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,634
<i>Eh, Japonaise.</i>

209
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,475
<i>Eh, Japonaise!</i>

210
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,307
- Monsieur, please.
- Eh.

211
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,517
- Is that all, Madame?
- Yes.

212
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:35,359
Eh, <i>Japonaise,</i> tell me the truth.
Does your pussy run crossways?

213
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,616
With a puff of straight hairs
like a little explosion?

214
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,287
- Hannibal!
- Ah!

215
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,504
Don't move.

216
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,017
The butcher tried
to get the Knife, stating he'd kill

217
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,178
everyone in the market.

218
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:13,442
Well... the butcher was Vichy,

219
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,946
a collaborator
with the German occupation.

220
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:21,074
He's much hated,
and I can deal with him.

221
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,118
Young man,

222
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:35,290
if you are to be a doctor, you
must be careful with your hands.

223
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:39,756
No more fighting. I never give
more than a single pass.

224
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,028
Forgive me.

225
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,360
I cannot seek revenge.

226
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,533
Hannibal needs peace.

227
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,592
Ah!

228
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:34,181
If you've pissed in my fuel tank,
I'll twist your head off.

229
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,688
- Paul Momund, the butcher.
- Huh!

230
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,559
You owe a certain lady an apology.

231
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:46,025
Apologise to la <i>Japonaise?</i>
Boy, you must be crazy to come here.

232
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:50,113
I'll throw you in the river,
or maybe I'll slit your pants

233
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,995
and give you something you don't want
where you don't want it.

234
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:58,659
You inquired about her... pussy.

235
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:02,421
You speculated it ran which way?

236
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,376
Jap pussy runs crossways.

237
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:07,919
You should fuck that little Jap
and see for yourself, huh?

238
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,632
Crossways like that?

239
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,732
Ah! Ah!

240
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,237
Or more tangential to the spine?

241
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,023
Ah!

242
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,775
Ah!

243
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,586
Ugh.

244
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,090
Do you see how your mouth
stains the air?

245
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:52,130
I should add that to my drawing.
Would you like to see it?

246
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,141
Yum!

247
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,356
Wait for me.

248
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:53,320
- It was made with a single blow.
- Ah, Inspector Popil.

249
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:57,157
I'm very happy you could come.
You won't remember me, but...

250
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:01,369
Of course, you delivered De Rais
to Nuremberg and sat behind him.

251
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,250
I saw you bring the evidence.

252
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,502
It's an honour, sir.

253
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:10,674
- What do we have here?
- Paul Momund, or most of him.

254
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,175
You have his dossier.

255
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:16,338
Yes. Fat and ugly.

256
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:20,555
He shipped Jews from Marseille.

257
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,016
- He fought recently.
- And often.

258
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,774
Last Saturday night, in a bar fight.
He had many enemies.

259
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,356
A list, please. His recent opponents.

260
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:36,784
- You've done nothing to this body?
- Oh, no, no. The chief specifically...

261
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:40,867
The odour,
it's not of anything you use here?

262
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,372
It smells like the toothache remedy.

263
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,659
Yes, oil of cloves.

264
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,579
Let's see the pharmacist.

265
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,707
Look

266
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:55,502
The most exquisite bits of the fish
are the cheeks.

267
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,423
This is true for many creatures.
When carving at the table,

268
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,013
give one cheek to Madame,
the other to the guest of honour.

269
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:07,351
Did you hear? They haven't found
the butcher's damned ugly head yet.

270
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,478
Good evening, my lady.

271
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,156
I hope you don't mind.

272
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:49,075
I would have used the butcher's knife,
but the sword seemed so appropriate.

273
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,387
Not a nick in the blade, I promise you.

274
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,434
The butcher was like butter.

275
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,915
You didn't need to do this for me.

276
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:40,050
Rudeness is epidemic, my lady.

277
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,139
Police.

278
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,605
They will call it murder.

279
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,104
At worst, a crime of passion.

280
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:06,029
Wash your hands, quickly. Go!

281
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,286
Inspector Pop-il?

282
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,747
<i>- Pop“, Madame.
- Pop“.</i>

283
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,922
Hannibal Lecter?

284
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,675
Good evening.

285
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:26,304
You fought with the butcher,
Paul Momund, in the market.

286
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:32,223
Now he is dead.
I must ask you to come along with me.

287
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,434
Is your name Hannibal Lecter?

288
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,060
Yes.

289
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:48,573
Do you have any guilty knowledge
of the death of Paul Momund?

290
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:52,455
- Guilty knowledge?
- Limit your responses to yes or no.

291
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,205
No.

292
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:06,837
It's vanilla. He reacts to nothing.

293
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,557
It's monstrous.

294
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,811
The butcher had been fishing.

295
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:22,694
There was blood and scales
on his knife, but no fish.

296
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,981
The tape tells you all that?

297
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,240
Remarkable.

298
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,615
No.

299
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,373
The chef told me you brought
a splendid fish in for dinner.

300
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,875
Where did you get that fish?

301
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,036
By fishing, Inspector.

302
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,957
We keep a baited line in the water
behind the boathouse.

303
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,422
I'll show you if you like.

304
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,087
My speciality is war crimes.

305
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,307
And I know they
do not end with the war.

306
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,310
You lost your entire family.

307
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,643
So did I.

308
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,606
But for you, your beautiful aunt
came and made up for it all.

309
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:08,315
The very scent of her must have
taken away the smell of the camp.

310
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:12,156
So, when Paul the butcher
spewed filth at her,

311
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,163
I can understand if you killed him.

312
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,825
Tell me what happened, Hannibal.

313
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,502
Together we could show a court...

314
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,256
"The very scent of her
takes away the smell of the camp."

315
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:31,175
Do you compose verse, Inspector,
and keep it under your pillow?

316
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:54,194
Now tell me, Inspector,

317
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:59,037
did you choose war crimes
because you lost family in the war?

318
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,292
Yes.

319
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,544
How?

320
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,040
Some in combat,
some were shipped east.

321
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,131
- Did you catch who did it?
- No.

322
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:16,095
- They were Vichy, men like the butcher?
- Yes.

323
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,186
Then we are both suspects.

324
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,939
I can say you were fishing with me
if you like.

325
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,229
Inspector, you should see this.

326
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,650
I told you, keep these people away.

327
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,834
- It's the butcher?
- Yes, sir.

328
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,621
- How long?
- Ten minutes, no longer.

329
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,615
Would you please?

330
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:22,786
Ah, Madame, so sorry to disturb you.
I was passing with the papers and...

331
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,579
Um, your legal residence
in France is threatened now.

332
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,793
We can delay it with death duties,

333
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,504
so you can stay in the house
for the time being.

334
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:36,137
But inevitably, the state
will take it and sell it at auction.

335
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,641
You will have to let the staff go.
Good night.

336
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,778
Father, Mother.

337
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:58,530
I'm the youngest student they've ever
admitted into medical school.

338
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,659
It's a work scholarship.

339
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,204
I think you would be pleased.

340
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:09,204
<i>Death duties on my uncle's estate</i>

341
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,544
<i>have finally forced the sale
of the chateau.</i>

342
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:16,052
<i>Lady Murasaki will leave
for Paris with me.</i>

343
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,019
<i>This work scholarship means
I must spend much of my spare time</i>

344
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,901
<i>preparing bodies for the anatomy class.</i>

345
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:39,860
<i>My studies are fascinating
and absorb me completely.</i>

346
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,334
<i>Yet I still find myself
thinking about my sister</i>

347
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,370
<i>and the men who took her from me.</i>

348
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,334
<i>Hannibal!</i>

349
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,929
Do you suppose
God intended to eat Isaac?

350
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,342
That's why he told Abraham to kill him.

351
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:09,017
Eat him? Of course not.

352
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,853
The angel intervenes in time.

353
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,900
Not always.

354
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:26,031
I have to know about Mischa.

355
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,794
I can see their faces in my dreams,

356
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:36,549
but I can't remember what they called
each other with their bloody mouths.

357
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,887
I would give anything to remember.

358
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:49,392
Hannibal, memory is a knife.

359
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:52,057
It can hurt you.

360
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,879
I want to stay here with you.

361
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,886
No. You must stay at school.

362
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,735
Louis, I need you to remember.

363
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,201
Who told the Nazis
where the children were hidden?

364
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,333
You must remember.

365
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:56,872
I can't bear to think about it.

366
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,128
This will help you remember.

367
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:05,346
Hannibal Lecter.
What are you doing here?

368
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,425
The body. I'm a medical student now.

369
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:13,145
Yes, I know.
I have followed your progress.

370
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,979
You repeat nothing
you hear in this room.

371
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:24,274
Please, Louis. Klaus Barbie
shipped the children to Auschwitz.

372
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:28,945
Who told him where the children
were hidden? Did you tell him?

373
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:35,710
When they broke my fingers,
I gave them Pardou.

374
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,915
Pardou knew
where the children were hidden.

375
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:50,053
He's mayor of Belleville now.

376
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,970
- Thank you, Louis.
- Inspector?

377
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,561
- Yes?
- Where were the police?

378
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:19,413
No, no, no. No, no, please, please.

379
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,936
You knew at once what Louis wanted.

380
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:44,024
His crucifix to remain with his brain,
not his heart.

381
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:48,863
He answered your question,
but you didn't answer his.

382
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:54,122
Where were the police when the Nazis
threw the children into the trucks?

383
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,676
<i>Hannibal!</i>

384
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,353
Come and play.

385
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:55,364
One little cheek... two little cheeks.

386
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,116
Cough.

387
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,371
- She has pneumonia.
- Let's take her.

388
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,171
She's going to die anyway.

389
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,595
Hannibal!

390
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,407
Come on!

391
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,948
- Get out!
- Grutas, wait!

392
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,368
The dog tags.

393
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,206
Come on!

394
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,339
Pot Watcher, hurry!

395
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,845
Passport.

396
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,819
- Student?
- Yes.

397
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,491
You need a new photograph.

398
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,425
<i>Da.</i>

399
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,760
Night report.

400
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:53,313
Entry visas for Kaunas.

401
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,711
Lecter.

402
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,126
The lodge.

403
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,227
Kolnas.

404
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:31,527
Grutas.

405
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,045
Mischa.

406
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:14,070
Herr Dortlich.

407
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:19,580
On behalf of myself and my late family,

408
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,615
I thank you for coming.

409
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:25,919
Do you remember the bathtub
bubbling on the stove?

410
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:29,923
She was dead anyway, I swear it.
She was.

411
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,097
Oh.

412
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:41,218
Mm.

413
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:44,730
So much mayonnaise, Herr Dortlich.

414
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:10,422
- Where are the others?
- I don't know.

415
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,815
Yes, I know where one of them is.
Grentz, I know Grentz.

416
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,445
- Grentz?
- In Canada.

417
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:37,199
He got out on a refugee boat
from Bremerhaven.

418
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:40,781
- What did he look like?
- Swarthy.

419
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:43,071
They wouldn't have let him in the SS.

420
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:49,162
Oh, yes, of course. That's the one
that always provided the bowl.

421
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,671
What about Milko?

422
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,299
All dead. They're all dead.

423
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:58,258
- In the war.
- I remember his singing.

424
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:04,221
And now your leader, Grutas.

425
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,684
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

426
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:14,024
Please, please, let me go
and I will testify against Grentz.

489
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:30,458
Where is he? Where is he, this poison
little boy who killed Dortlich, hm?

490
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,995
He's a Paris schoolboy.

491
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:37,586
There is a passport photograph,
but they don't have it yet.

492
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,842
What's his name?

493
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:43,175
Hannibal Lecter.

494
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:51,521
You know him?

495
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,854
So do you.

496
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:57,109
We, uh...

497
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:00,067
We had dinner with him during the war.

498
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:06,740
Go back to your restaurant, Kolnas.

499
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:15,711
Hey! Bring me a covered dish next time.

500
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,300
Where the hell is Dieter?

501
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:27,636
Dieter!

502
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:31,678
You bruise their face, you split
their lip, the money goes down.

503
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,938
Come here.

504
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:39,277
And that one, that one is mine for now.

505
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:44,991
Milko, I want you to go to Paris.

506
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:48,495
Kolnas found me a Bösendorfer piano.
The best.

507
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:54,501
Oh, and, uh... find the boy. Lecter.

508
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,082
You know what to do with him.

509
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:12,601
Thanks.

510
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:46,340
Inspector Popil, please come in.

511
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:49,471
This is, uh, not a social call.

512
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:58,139
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

513
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:00,433
At medical school, I think.

514
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:03,273
Did you ever see this man?

515
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,493
No.

516
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:16,370
His name's Dortlich.
He's a war criminal.

517
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:20,291
He was found near the castle
Hannibal came from.

518
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:26,168
Dortlich had some ugly friends.
I want to know where they are.

519
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,380
Hannibal may know.

520
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:51,450
Don't out yourself.

521
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,331
I know about you.

522
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:07,509
I know you lost your family, everything,
when the bomb fell on Hiroshima.

523
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,675
Yes.

524
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:19,312
And you protect Hannibal
because he lost everything too?

525
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,724
That is your bond with him?

526
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:29,318
Do you see your family
in your dreams, Inspector?

527
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,733
Yes.

528
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,870
So do I.

529
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,953
So does he.

530
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:54,681
If your pet snake strikes in France,
I will have to seize him.

531
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,932
And he will die under the guillotine.

532
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,414
Sorry.

533
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:51,492
Ah!

534
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:07,766
It was Grutas who sent you to kill me.

535
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,098
No, not to kill you.

536
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,561
To give you money.

537
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:17,567
Let me give it to you.

538
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:28,783
No!

539
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:55,848
- You killed so many, Milko.
- No!

540
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:57,733
Many more than these.

541
01:25:59,446 --> 01:26:02,063
Do you feel them in the tank around you?

542
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,607
Hm?

543
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,162
We ate her...

544
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:13,164
We ate her to live.

545
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:20,047
Grutas was very quick. She felt nothing.

546
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:26,053
So, Grutas has a house? Where?

547
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:39,149
I have difficulty hearing you.

548
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:41,936
He has a house?

549
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:49,193
No! All right, all right.

550
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,908
Milly-Ia-forêt.

551
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:59,329
No... No!

552
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,294
She felt nothing!

553
01:27:56,855 --> 01:28:01,224
Oh, Inspector Popil. What a surprise.

554
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,403
Found in your room.

555
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:17,449
If you kill in France,
I will see your head in a bucket.

556
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:21,623
Do you mind if I work while we talk?

557
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:28,335
You killed Dortlioh
in the woods where your family died.

558
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:34,716
- His face had been eaten.
- I would suspect the ravens.

559
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:37,476
Ravens who made a shish kebab?

560
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,396
Cannibalism.

561
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:45,852
It happened on the eastern front.

562
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:49,067
But you know that, don't you?
You were there.

563
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:56,700
This is not the face of your subject.

564
01:28:56,873 --> 01:29:00,411
This is Vladis Grutas,
like the pictures in your room.

565
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,667
Did you kill him too?

566
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:07,874
- No, I didn't.
- Have you found him?

567
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:13,838
If I found him, I give you my word,
I would bring him to your attention.

568
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,722
Don't fool with me.

569
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:21,141
Did you know he sawed off the head
of the rabbi at Kaunas?

570
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:23,521
He shot Gypsy children in the woods.

571
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:29,358
He walked free at Nuremberg because a
witness got acid poured down her throat.

572
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:34,942
I will need your deposition.
Come with me.

573
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,041
Let's begin.

574
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:57,764
Put it down, or I'll shoot her.

575
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:01,347
<i>Grutas has the eyes
of an arctic wolf.</i>

576
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:06,106
<i>He knew at once to threaten Mischa
to make me put down the spear.</i>

577
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:12,731
<i>At first, they needed us for cover
in case troops found them.</i>

578
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:17,903
<i>Later... they crowded around,</i>

579
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,241
<i>feeling our cheeks and arms.</i>

580
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:25,626
Ah! Ah!

581
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:28,583
Hold her head still!
Hold her head still!

582
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:31,340
- Mischa!
- Hold it still.

583
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:34,672
Not in here, boss. Not in here.

584
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:43,886
Hannibal!

585
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,295
I promised Mischa.

586
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:18,087
Promised to make them pay
a pound of flesh?

587
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:20,471
To pay skin for skin?

588
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:26,270
If they'd killed you,
who will punish them then?

589
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:31,563
The answer is me. I will.

590
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:39,408
If you swear to share what you know
with me, then I will let you go.

591
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:42,778
I swear.

592
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,697
Jack.

593
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:56,466
He knows something.

594
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:02,215
He'll lead us to Grutas,
then we'll arrest him.

595
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:06,677
The court has to declare him insane,

596
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:11,144
and in an asylum the doctors
can study him and find out what he is.

597
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:14,810
<i>The little boy Hannibal
died in 1944 out in that snow.</i>

598
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:21,442
<i>His heart died with Mischa.</i>

599
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:27,578
What he is now,
there's no word for it...

600
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:31,876
...except monster.

601
01:33:10,877 --> 01:33:13,619
Give these men to the police.

602
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,914
It's Kolnas's children, isn't it?

603
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,835
No.

604
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:38,443
Promise me.

605
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:48,161
<i>Hannibal!</i>

606
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:50,413
I can't.

607
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:56,420
I can't. I already promised Mischa.

608
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:34,677
- No word from Milko?
- No.

609
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:43,484
Come on.

610
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:43,203
Get out.

611
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:49,259
Where is your identification?

612
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,801
Where is Milko?

613
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:56,887
I don't know, and I don't give a damn.

614
01:36:57,061 --> 01:37:01,851
He paid me to bring you this piano.
Get my bike down.

615
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:20,123
Shh.

616
01:37:20,293 --> 01:37:22,785
Don't worry. I won't hit you again.

617
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:26,504
I like you now.

618
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,763
Maybe I'll fix your teeth.

619
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:52,485
I want to steam.

620
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:54,740
Turn it up.

621
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:26,022
I'm glad you're here.

622
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,193
I always felt I owed you something.

623
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:41,739
I thought you would be bigger.

624
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:45,034
I put your face
on every bully I ever hurt.

625
01:38:54,429 --> 01:38:55,794
Kill him.

626
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:27,291
Answer me this.

627
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:31,877
Would you have fed me to your
little sister because you loved her?

628
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:37,423
- Yes.
- There.

629
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:40,009
There you have it.

630
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:42,470
Love.

631
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:47,353
I love myself that much
and I would never apologise to you.

632
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,481
Cut him!

633
01:39:52,028 --> 01:39:53,644
Wait!

634
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:55,812
Look at me.

635
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:59,483
And it won't hurt so much.

636
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:12,871
Bitch!

637
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:23,382
Get him! Go!

638
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:28,640
- Call Kolnas.
- OK.

639
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:09,303
To continue our conversation,

640
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:14,691
do you wish to see Lady Murasaki alive?

641
01:41:16,529 --> 01:41:18,315
Yes.

642
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:32,250
Listen to her.
Speak to your little fuck boy.

643
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:37,422
Listen. Listen carefully.

644
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:41,802
I offer you a life for a life.
Bring me everything you have.

645
01:41:41,971 --> 01:41:45,930
The dog tags, Pot Watcher's
little inventory, every fucking thing.

646
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:50,264
- Where?
- Kilometre 36 on the way to Trilbardou.

647
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:54,853
There is a telephone kiosk.
Be there at sunrise and wait for a call.

648
01:41:55,026 --> 01:42:00,487
If you are not there,
I will send her cheeks in the mail.

649
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:02,738
A life for a life.

650
01:42:11,584 --> 01:42:14,702
I know your asshole...

651
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:17,917
...will look just like a violet.

652
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:32,931
Mmm. Mm!

653
01:42:37,735 --> 01:42:39,692
Take her away.

654
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:44,447
Kolnas, bring me a jar.

655
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:48,034
Kill him at the telephone kiosk.

656
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:51,075
Bring his balls to the boat.

657
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:28,817
- We're ready to sail, sir.
- Come on!

658
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:47,882
I'm sorry.
Your room isn't quite ready yet.

659
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:50,171
I'll contact room service.

660
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:52,465
Please.

661
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,725
Eva!

662
01:43:55,855 --> 01:44:00,224
Clean up the treatment room.
Our old guests are leaving.

663
01:44:00,401 --> 01:44:02,642
We have a new one checking in.

664
01:44:05,531 --> 01:44:06,942
Get out!

665
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:09,824
See that Eva cleans them up
before Achmed sees them.

666
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,907
Don't bite the women.
Bite Achmed's gold.

667
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,957
Drive safely to Marseilles.

668
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:37,014
You know what will happen...

669
01:44:38,773 --> 01:44:42,232
...if you don't give me some, please?

670
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:22,889
Good evening, Herr Kolnas.

671
01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:26,025
You drink better wine than you serve.

672
01:45:26,195 --> 01:45:27,685
I'm calling the police.

673
01:45:29,448 --> 01:45:32,315
May I get them for you?

674
01:45:34,411 --> 01:45:36,823
What did I do to you?

675
01:45:36,997 --> 01:45:39,284
Aside from eating my sister, nothing.

676
01:45:40,209 --> 01:45:42,667
Are you wearing your dog tag,
Herr Kolnas?

677
01:45:42,837 --> 01:45:46,501
Many people look like me.
Are you sure you have the right person?

678
01:45:47,508 --> 01:45:51,001
I was slave labour
for the Nazis in the war.

679
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:53,670
I lost family too. I understand.

680
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:59,810
Well, to improve your understanding,
I went by your home on the Rue Juliana.

681
01:46:00,729 --> 01:46:06,850
<i>I went into the children's room
with the sleeping child.</i>

682
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:23,325
And... I picked up something
for your oven.

683
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:35,379
It's a beef roast, Kolnas.
Do you see how it feels?

684
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:45,062
Agh! Agh!

685
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:47,599
Where is she? Ah!

686
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:07,459
Where is my daughter?

687
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:10,212
What did you do to her?

688
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,928
Your daughter is safe, Herr Kolnas.

689
01:47:19,475 --> 01:47:22,968
I will give her back to you
when you give me Lady Murasaki.

690
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:28,689
If I do that, then I am a dead man.

691
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:30,725
No.

692
01:47:30,903 --> 01:47:34,942
Grutas will be arrested.
I won't remember your face.

693
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:43,367
Help me,
or I'll leave the child to starve.

694
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:48,208
Where is Lady Murasaki?

695
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:50,791
Grutas has a houseboat.

696
01:47:50,965 --> 01:47:53,377
A canal boat. He moves around.

697
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:55,632
Where is the boat?

698
01:47:59,932 --> 01:48:03,550
In Canal I'Ourcq, west of Meaux.

699
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:08,729
Where is my Child?

700
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:35,964
- Hello?
<i>- Hello?</i>

701
01:48:36,135 --> 01:48:39,002
- Hello, Astrid?
<i>- Yes?</i>

702
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:43,138
Look at the children.
Look at the children!

703
01:48:43,308 --> 01:48:45,675
<i>- Why?
-</i> Just do it!

704
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:57,650
The children are fine.
They're sleeping.

705
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:03,906
<i>Petras. Hello? Petras?</i>

706
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:06,741
You tricked me.

707
01:49:06,915 --> 01:49:09,782
No. I kept my word.

708
01:49:11,336 --> 01:49:14,328
I will spare your life
for the sake of your children.

709
01:50:23,367 --> 01:50:25,449
Your boyfriend...

710
01:50:26,912 --> 01:50:29,404
...ate Dortlich's face.

711
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:21,713
Jean, tie her up. I'll go astern.

712
01:51:54,458 --> 01:51:56,244
Agh! No!

713
01:52:01,423 --> 01:52:03,460
- Jean?
- Help me!

714
01:52:08,472 --> 01:52:11,840
Grab it. Grab it!

715
01:52:28,116 --> 01:52:29,698
Hold it!

716
01:52:32,162 --> 01:52:34,244
Jean!

717
01:53:11,368 --> 01:53:13,200
No! Hannibal!

718
01:53:23,839 --> 01:53:27,048
Shot in the spine, my little <i>Mann/em.</i>

719
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:41,183
Can't feel your legs? Too bad.

720
01:53:41,356 --> 01:53:43,723
You won't feel it
when I cut off your balls.

721
01:53:46,361 --> 01:53:49,444
A present for you. A velvet bag.

722
01:53:51,908 --> 01:53:55,572
Can you see? Good.

723
01:53:57,372 --> 01:54:01,616
Look at this.
I can put some colour in her cheeks.

724
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,285
Mmm!

725
01:54:10,302 --> 01:54:12,384
Come on.

726
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:22,060
Ah!

727
01:54:23,148 --> 01:54:24,263
Ah!

728
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:55,552
Agh!

729
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:20,820
Where is Grentz?

730
01:55:21,957 --> 01:55:26,201
If I tell you, will you kill me quickly?

731
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:27,834
Yes.

732
01:55:29,965 --> 01:55:32,206
A village in Canada.

733
01:55:34,553 --> 01:55:36,009
Near Saskatoon.

734
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:41,427
Stop, Hannibal.

735
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:44,427
Give him to Popil.

736
01:55:45,105 --> 01:55:47,597
He ate my sister.

737
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:55,939
So did you. You ate her too.

738
01:55:57,033 --> 01:55:59,274
So why don't you kill yourself?

739
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:06,370
- No.
- Pot Watcher fed her to you in a broth.

740
01:56:06,543 --> 01:56:08,159
Liar.

741
01:56:08,336 --> 01:56:14,673
You have to kill everyone
who knows it, don't you?

742
01:56:14,843 --> 01:56:20,589
You ate her, half-conscious,

743
01:56:20,765 --> 01:56:24,975
your little lips
greedy around the spoon.

744
01:56:35,363 --> 01:56:38,105
Agh!

745
01:56:40,118 --> 01:56:41,904
Ah!

746
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:47,872
No!

747
01:56:55,425 --> 01:56:57,382
Ah!

748
01:56:58,595 --> 01:57:00,302
No!

749
01:57:00,472 --> 01:57:04,636
Hannibal, stop! Stop! Stop! Oh!

750
01:57:05,185 --> 01:57:07,973
Ah!

751
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:12,022
Ah!

752
01:57:13,818 --> 01:57:15,650
M for Mischa.

753
01:57:18,073 --> 01:57:19,563
Agh!

754
01:58:11,626 --> 01:58:14,994
Stop. Stop now.

755
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:17,375
Forgive them.

756
01:58:25,265 --> 01:58:26,630
Never.

757
01:58:38,778 --> 01:58:40,314
<i>Have you.</i>

758
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:53,957
What is left in you to love?

759
01:59:07,474 --> 01:59:09,590
Ah!

760
01:59:45,762 --> 01:59:47,628
- No, no.
- Find me the captain.

761
01:59:47,806 --> 01:59:50,047
I came as soon as I heard.

762
01:59:56,773 --> 01:59:58,855
Where is Hannibal?

763
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,692
Come on.

764
02:00:08,493 --> 02:00:10,325
Hannibal!

765
02:00:22,132 --> 02:00:24,373
- Call the fire brigade.
- Yes, Inspector.

766
02:00:28,763 --> 02:00:30,845
Take some men. Get down there.

767
02:01:00,712 --> 02:01:02,794
Hannibal.

768
02:01:28,239 --> 02:01:30,321
Coming.

769
02:01:55,475 --> 02:01:57,557
Yes?

770
02:01:59,771 --> 02:02:01,887
I came to collect a head.

771
02:02:17,956 --> 02:02:22,496
♪ A little man stands in
the forest completely still and quiet. ♪

772
02:02:22,724 --> 02:02:27,957
♪ He wears a little, pure purple cloak. ♪

773
02:02:28,029 --> 02:02:30,429
♪ Say! Who can that little man be ♪

774

775
02:02:33,034 --> 02:02:37,903
♪ With the little crimson cloak? ♪

775
02:02:38,305 --> 02:03:38,567
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
