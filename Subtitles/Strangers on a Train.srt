1
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,313
Excuse me.

2
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,905
I beg your pardon.
Aren't you Guy Haines?

3
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,698
Oh, sure.

4
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,118
I saw you blast Faraday right off
the court in South Orange last season.

5
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,121
- Made the semifinals, didn't you?
- Yeah.

6
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,750
Oh, I certainly admire people
who do things.

7
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,506
By the way, my name is Bruno.
Bruno Anthony. See?

8
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,385
It's corny,
but my mother gave it to me...

9
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,012
...so I wear it to please her.
- How do you do?

10
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,431
I don't talk much.
You go ahead and read.

11
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,016
Thanks.

12
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,106
You know, it must be pretty exciting
to be so important.

13
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,026
- Tennis player isn't so important.
- But people who do things are.

14
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:19,657
Me, I never do anything. I suppose you're
going to Southampton for the doubles.

15
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,325
You are a tennis fan.

16
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:25,538
Gee, I wish I could go watch you,
but I've gotta get back to Washington.

17
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,415
I'm from Arlington, you know.

18
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,921
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke much.

19
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,549
Me, I smoke too much.

20
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,051
Oh, here.

21
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,678
Oh, thanks.

22
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,180
Elegant.

23
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,645
"From A to G."
I'll bet I can guess who "A" is.

24
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,480
- Yeah?
- Anne Morton.

25
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:56,569
You see, sometimes I turn the sports
page, and I see the society section.

26
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,488
And the pictures.
She's very beautiful.

27
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,782
Senator Morton's daughter, huh?

28
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,327
You're quite a reader, Mr. Anthony.

29
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,830
Yes, I am. Ask me anything.
I got the answer.

30
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,707
Even about people I don't know.

31
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,669
Like who would like to marry whom...

32
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:19,550
...when his wife gets her divorce.
- Perhaps you read too much.

33
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:24,138
Oh, there I go again. Too friendly.
It always happens.

34
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,392
I meet somebody who I like and admire,
and I open my mouth too much.

35
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,896
That's all right, forget it.
I guess I'm a little jittery.

36
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,190
Oh, there's a new cure for that.

37
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,317
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.

38
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:40,738
Scotch and plain water, please.
A pair. Doubles.

39
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,492
- The only kind of doubles I play.
- You'll have to drink both.

40
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,202
And I can do it.

41
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,497
When's the wedding?

42
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,333
- What?
- The wedding. You and Anne Morton.

43
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,751
It was in the papers.

44
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,338
It shouldn't have been. Unless they
legalized bigamy overnight.

45
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,258
Oh, I've got a wonderful theory
about that.

46
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,552
Someday I'll tell you about it.

47
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:08,224
But right now, I suppose divorce is,
well, the simplest operation.

48
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,562
It's wonderful having you
as company all the way to New York.

49
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,274
I'm not going direct.
I'm stopping off at Metcalf.

50
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,653
Metcalf? Who would want
to stop off at Metcalf?

51
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,446
Well, it's my hometown.

52
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:27,284
Oh, I get it. A little chat
with your wife about the divorce.

53
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,161
Close enough.

54
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,871
Thanks. I think I will.

55
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,541
Well, here's luck.

56
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,461
Drink up, and we'll have lunch sent
to my compartment.

57
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,466
Thanks, but I'll go to the dining car.
Oh, waiter.

58
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:47,638
- Are there any seats in the diner?
- Not for about 20 minutes, sir.

59
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,640
You'll have to lunch with me.

60
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,060
Well...

61
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,479
...here's to the next Mrs. Haines.

62
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:05,281
Sure, I went to college.
Got kicked out of three of them.

63
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,575
Drinking and gambling.

64
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,286
Not like you, huh?
All right, so I'm a bum.

65
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,830
Who said you were?

66
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,623
My father.

67
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,501
He hates me.

68
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:22,339
With all his money, he thinks I ought
to catch the 8:05 bus every morning...

69
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:26,343
...punch a time clock and work my way
up selling paint or something.

70
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,637
What do you think of a man like that?

71
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,601
- Well, I think possibly...
- Yes, I hate him too.

72
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:38,022
I tell you, I get so sore
at him sometimes...

73
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,857
...I want to kill him.

74
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,695
- I don't think you know what you want.
- Well, I want to do something.

75
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,530
Everything.

76
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:51,952
You know, I've got a theory that you
should do everything before you die.

77
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:57,792
Have you ever driven a car
blindfolded at 150 miles an hour?

78
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,377
Not lately.

79
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,506
I did. I flew in a jet plane too.

80
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,844
Man, that's a thrill. Almost blew
the sawdust out of my head.

81
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,558
And I'm going to make a reservation
on the first rocket to the moon.

82
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,687
- What are you trying to prove?
- Well, I'm not like you.

83
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,981
You're lucky. You're smart.

84
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,570
Marrying the boss' daughter makes
a nice shortcut to a career, doesn't it?

85
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,574
Marrying the senator's daughter has
nothing to do with it.

86
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,411
Can't I look beyond a tennis net
without being out for something?

87
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,873
Take it easy. I'm your friend,
remember? I like you.

88
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,834
I'd do anything for you.

89
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,418
Sure, Bruno.

90
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,547
We'll be pulling in soon.
I've got to change trains.

91
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,675
What did you say her name was?
Your wife's?

92
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,927
- Miriam.
- Miriam, that's it.

93
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,221
Miriam Joyce Haines.

94
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,849
I suppose she played around a lot.

95
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,600
Skip it, Bruno.

96
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,937
It's painful for a man
to discover he's been a chump.

97
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,606
Okay.

98
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:09,363
Wanna hear one of my ideas
for a perfect murder?

99
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,949
The "light socket in the bathroom"...

100
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,869
...or the "carbon monoxide
in the garage"?

101
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:19,290
Neither one. I may be old-fashioned,
but murder is against the law.

102
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,836
What is a life or two, Guy?
Some people are better off dead.

103
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,089
Well, like your wife and my father,
for instance.

104
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:32,094
Oh, that reminds me
of a wonderful idea I had once.

105
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,849
I used to put myself to sleep
at night figuring it out.

106
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,937
Now, let's say that you'd like
to get rid of your wife.

107
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,816
- That's a morbid thought.
- No, no, no. Just suppose.

108
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,735
Let's say you had a good reason.

109
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,238
- No, let's not...
- No, no. Let's say.

110
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,159
You'd be afraid to kill her.
You know why. You'd get caught.

111
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,911
And what would trip you up?

112
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,954
The motive.

113
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,832
Ah... Now, here's my idea.

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,667
I haven't got time to listen.

115
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,503
Listen. It's so simple too.

116
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,007
Two fellows meet accidentally,
like you and me.

117
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,177
No connection.
Never saw each other before.

118
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:17,306
Each one has somebody that he'd like
to get rid of.

119
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,974
So...

120
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,643
...they swap murders.

121
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,937
Swap murders?

122
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,855
Each does the other's murder.

123
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,109
Then there's nothing to connect them.
Each one has murdered a stranger.

124
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:32,529
Like you do my murder, I do yours.

125
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,782
We're coming into my station.

126
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,453
For example, your wife, my father.
Crisscross.

127
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,913
What?

128
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,374
We do talk the same language, don't we?

129
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,502
Sure, we talk the same language.
Thanks for lunch.

130
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,464
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
The lamb chops were a little overdone.

131
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,882
Nice meeting you.

132
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,552
Now, you think my theory's okay, Guy?
I mean, you like it?

133
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,972
Sure, Bruno, sure.

134
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,640
They're all okay.

135
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,537
Crisscross.

136
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,896
- Hi, Bill.
- Guy Haines! Good to see you, boy.

137
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,108
You better win at Southampton.
I got 2 bucks on you.

138
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,486
- Park these in a lucky spot, will you?
- Sure thing.

139
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,304
One-fifty, 2, 3, 4, 5.
There you are.

140
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,639
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

141
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,644
- Hello, Guy.
- You're looking well, Miriam.

142
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,646
So are you.

143
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,150
Got a nice tan playing tennis
with all your rich friends.

144
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,821
What time do we meet your lawyer?

145
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,241
- What's your hurry?
- My hurry?

146
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,327
That's funny, coming from you.

147
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,246
You're the one who's in a hurry,
aren't you?

148
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,665
When you wouldn't give
me the divorce...

149
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,668
...I sort of hoped it was
because you were jealous.

150
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,423
I got over being jealous
a long time ago, Miriam.

151
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,011
Let's talk in here.

152
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,192
Well, this is cozier.
Sort of like old times, isn't it?

153
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,069
Oh, skip it, Miriam.

154
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,531
It's pretty late to start flirting
with a discarded husband.

155
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,992
Especially when you're going
to have another man's baby.

156
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,870
You know, I think you're
handsomer than ever.

157
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,373
Let's see your lawyer
and get this over with.

158
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,792
You bring the money?
Lawyers are expensive.

159
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,335
Yes.

160
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,134
Here it is.

161
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:45,222
If I'd known what all that tennis
nonsense of yours would lead to...

162
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,558
...I wouldn't have run out on you.

163
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,810
What are you trying to say, Miriam?

164
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,896
I'm not getting a divorce.

165
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,109
You little double-crosser!
I didn't want this divorce. You did.

166
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,403
You've been harping
about it all year!

167
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,114
It's a woman's privilege
to change her mind.

168
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,033
Now I can buy me
some pretty new clothes.

169
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,246
I wouldn't want you to be ashamed
of me in Washington...

170
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,915
...when we go to all
those swanky parties.

171
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,252
- What do you mean by that?
- Don't look so mad, Guy.

172
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,380
You smile when your picture's
taken for the newspaper.

173
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,716
Especially with Anne Morton
on your arm.

174
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,759
Let's not talk about Anne Morton.

175
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,596
It's serious between you two, huh?

176
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,224
You can throw all your dreams
about her into the ashcan.

177
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,060
- I'm coming to Washington.
- What for?

178
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,148
- To have my baby and be with you.
- Why me? It's not my baby.

179
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,902
Yes, but people don't know that, Guy.
Do they?

180
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:44,656
Make a pretty story, the senator's
daughter involved with a married man.

181
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:48,202
- Especially when he's to be a father.
- You conniving liar!

182
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,078
Keep your voice down.

183
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:56,668
- What happened? He run out on you?
- No man runs out on me. Not even you.

184
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,505
You've been trying to get rid
of me long enough.

185
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,050
Now I'll go you one better.
I never wanna see or hear you again.

186
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:08,305
I could be pathetic as the deserted
mother in court. Think it over.

187
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,600
- Who would believe you?
- I'm warning you.

188
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,486
That's what should happen to people
like you. I'd like to find...

189
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:27,241
Break it up, folks. This isn't
the place for a family quarrel.

190
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,076
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,162
I'm leaving.

192
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,164
You heard what I said, Guy Haines.

193
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:38,001
You can't throw me away! I'm coming
to Washington to have my baby!

194
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,212
- Tell that to the Senate!
- Please.

195
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,465
Anne?

196
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,968
Anne, darling, I...

197
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,304
Yes, I'm in Metcalf.

198
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,100
No, everything didn't go smoothly.

199
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,270
She doesn't want the divorce.
Not now.

200
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,357
It's unbelievable.

201
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,779
Yes, I know how you must feel.

202
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,825
But you sound so savage, Guy.

203
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,161
Sure, I sound savage. I feel savage.
I'd like to break her neck.

204
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,709
I said, I'd like to break her foul,
useless little neck.

205
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,549
What's that?

206
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,552
I said, I could strangle her!

207
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,890
I do wish you'd keep your hands quiet.

208
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,268
You're so restless lately.

209
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,478
I like them to look just right.

210
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,897
Did I file them too short?

211
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,776
Oh, no, Ma.
They're just fine. Thanks.

212
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,574
- What's the matter?
- I'm all right. Don't worry about me.

213
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,535
But you look so pale, dear.

214
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,245
Are you out of vitamins?

215
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,665
I took a bottle yesterday, Ma.

216
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,877
A whole fifth.

217
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,298
Oh, but you have that look, dear.
I always can tell.

218
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,384
Now, you haven't been doing
anything foolish?

219
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,932
I do hope you've forgotten all
about that silly little plan of yours.

220
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,603
- Which one?
- About blowing up the White House.

221
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,231
Oh, Ma, I was only fooling.

222
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,817
Besides, what would the president say?

223
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,614
You're a naughty boy, Bruno.

224
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,284
You could always make me laugh.

225
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,292
Get shaved before
your father gets home.

226
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,965
I'm sick and tired of bowing
and scraping to the king.

227
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,469
Now, now.
Now, let's not lose control.

228
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,429
Come see my painting.

229
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,102
Bruno, I do wish
you'd take up painting.

230
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,771
Such a soothing pastime.

231
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,667
Oh, Mother, you're wonderful!

232
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,170
That's the old boy, all right.
That's Father.

233
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,176
Is it?

234
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,430
Oh...

235
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,307
I was trying to paint Saint Francis.

236
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:43,687
Excuse me, sir. They're ready
with your call to Southampton.

237
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,992
- I want to talk to you and your mother.
- Sorry, Father. Long distance.

238
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,788
- Must you take that tone with Bruno?
- Hello.

239
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,211
Guy. Bruno.

240
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,339
What? Now, who did you say this is?

241
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:16,386
Bruno, Guy. Bruno Anthony.
Don't you remember? On the train.

242
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,474
Are you getting your divorce?

243
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,728
He should be sent someplace
for treatment before it's too late!

244
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,063
Oh, so she double-crossed you.

245
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,648
Are you going to see her again?

246
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,904
Now, just let's have lunch first...

247
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:39,242
I'm going to have that boy taken care
of. If necessary, put under restraint!

248
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,266
- Good night, Mom.
- Now, don't stay out late.

249
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,935
- There's the bus!
- Hold on, driver!

250
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,979
- Hey, driver!
- Hey!

251
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,064
- Hurry!
- Hey, wait a minute!

252
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,816
Driver.

253
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,822
- I'll get it, Tom. Go ahead.
- Okay.

254
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,508
- Watch your step.
- Thanks.

255
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:19,968
Easy does it, Tommy.

256
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,179
- Hey, I'm hungry.
- Oh, hungry already!

257
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:34,190
- Hot dogs! Get them while
they're hot! Red-hot! Right over here!

258
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:39,154
- Yes, sir, get your popcorn
here. Fresh popcorn! Only 5 cents a bag!

259
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,655
Come and get it!

260
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,703
Come and get it! Here you are!

261
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,873
- Three cones, Arthur.
- What flavors you got?

262
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,083
- Vanilla.
- Vanilla? Swell.

263
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,631
- I should've had a hot dog before this.
- A hot dog?

264
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,716
Satisfy my craving a little better.

265
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,886
- Craving for what?
- I never saw a girl eat so much.

266
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,557
- Where do you put it all?
- This is good.

267
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,975
Want some money?

268
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,483
Are we going to the Tunnel of Love?

269
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,110
- The Tunnel of Love? Come on!
- Yeah. Great. Come on.

270
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,866
- What do you call that?
- I don't know.

271
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,035
You think we should get her weighed?

272
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:34,000
Stick them up. Bang, bang.

273
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,131
- Come closer, come closer!
Step right up and win a baby doll.

274
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,717
Let's go see who's the strongest.

275
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,183
Sixteen hundred. Who wants to take
a chance to win a Kewpie Doll?

276
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,727
- Strongest pays for the merry-go-round.
- Fair enough.

277
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,771
Here we go. Watch it.

278
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,398
Come on.

279
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,027
Sixteen hundred.
How about you, sir?

280
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,529
Thank you.

281
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,280
Here we go!

282
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,285
Seventeen hundred. You did not win
the Kewpie Doll that time.

283
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,621
Will you try it again, sir?

284
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,375
Here we go. Watch it now.

285
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:20,922
Sixteen hundred. Will you try it again
and win a nice Kewpie Doll for the lady?

286
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,674
Try your luck, mister?

287
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:28,346
- Come closer, come closer!
Step right up and win a baby doll!

288
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,306
Hot dogs! Here you are, folks!

289
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,727
Get them while they're hot!
Red-hot! Right over here!

290
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,603
Here we go.

291
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,405
You just won a Kewpie Doll.

292
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,907
Why, he's broken the thing.

293
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,244
Come on, Miriam. Come on.

294
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:54,247
- Everybody, step right up
and get your ticket cashed!

295
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,458
Let's go on the merry-go-round!

296
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:32,952
Let's sing. Come on.

297
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,357
Let's go for a boat ride.

298
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,862
- Get your popcorn here!
Fresh popcorn!

299
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,491
- How about some popcorn?
- You don't want any more to eat.

300
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,951
Not now!

301
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,286
No fun necking
with a mouthful of popcorn.

302
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,206
- Come on.
- Okay.

303
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,379
Take a ride. Take a slide.

304
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:29,759
Take a trip with lots of zip.
This way, ladies and gentlemen.

305
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,432
- How about this one?
- I'm gonna drive.

306
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,601
You're gonna drive?

307
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:41,896
Don't rock the boat!

308
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,859
- Here we go.
- Anchors aweigh, admiral.

309
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,236
You sure you know how
to steer this tub?

310
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,650
- Make him stop! Make him stop!
- I'm trying to steer the boat.

311
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,404
Hey, what's that? What are you doing?

312
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,490
Come on, come on, Miriam.

313
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,666
- Come on.
- Stop it!

314
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,015
Hang on.

315
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:07,523
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Easy does it, now. Let's not break a leg.

316
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,776
We got use for you later.

317
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,379
Hey, Miriam!

318
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,637
Is your name Miriam?

319
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,431
Why, yes. How did you...?

320
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,580
Hey, Miriam!

321
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,750
Miriam, where are you?

322
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,544
Miriam!

323
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:13,881
- Miriam, come on. Stop fooling.
- Think you can give us the slip?

324
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:17,176
- Hey, come on! Stop hiding.
- Miriam, where are you?

325
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,434
- Lost your girl, George?
Miriam!

326
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,269
Hey, here she is.

327
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,733
Look, she's fainted.

328
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,861
Come on, Miriam, get up.

329
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,864
What's the matter?

330
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,285
- She's dead!
- Dead?

331
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,953
Help, somebody, help!

332
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,247
Somebody send for a doctor!

333
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,374
Help!

334
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,753
Help! Help!

335
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,715
Help, somebody, help!

336
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,385
Help! Bring help!
Somebody bring a doctor! Help!

337
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,900
- Go get a cop. I don't know
what's going on over there.

338
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,881
Thank you.

339
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:04,367
- What's your opinion?
- You'll never make the Metropolitan.

340
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,662
Name's Collins.

341
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:11,374
On sabbatical, Delaware Tech.
Glad to meet you.

342
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:17,880
I just made a speech in New York
on integration.

343
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,010
In differential calculus,
a function is given...

344
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,140
...and the differential is obtained.
You understand?

345
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,475
Yes, I understand.

346
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,644
You do?

347
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,513
Guy!

348
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,937
Guy.

349
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,024
Over here, Guy.

350
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,262
- Hello, Guy.
- What are you doing here?

351
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,764
At this time of night?

352
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:52,391
You don't seem very pleased to see me.

353
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:55,186
- I've brought you a little present.
- What do you mean?

354
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,608
What's this all about?

355
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,568
Recognize them?

356
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,074
It was very quick.

357
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,493
She wasn't hurt in any way.

358
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,995
It was all over in no time.

359
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,915
I knew you'd be surprised.

360
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:20,253
There's nothing for us to worry about.
Nobody saw me.

361
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,214
Only Miriam.

362
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,967
And I was very careful, Guy.

363
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:30,179
Even when I dropped your cigarette
lighter there, I went back to pick it up.

364
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:36,352
Are you trying to tell me...?
Why, you maniac!

365
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:41,774
But, Guy, you wanted it. We planned it
on the train together, remember?

366
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,777
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think I'm going?

367
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:48,030
- I'm gonna call the police, of course.
- But you can't.

368
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,157
We'd both be arrested for murder.

369
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:54,620
- We'd both be arrested for murder?
- You're just as much in it as I am.

370
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,540
We planned it together. Crisscross.

371
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,835
- I do your murder...
- You think you can get away with it?

372
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:05,131
Oh, come, now. Why should I go
to Metcalf to kill a total stranger?

373
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:08,384
Unless it was part of the plan,
and you were in on it.

374
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,387
You're the one who benefits, Guy.

375
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,056
You're a free man now.

376
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,809
I didn't even know the girl.

377
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,565
I had nothing to do with this.
The police will believe me.

378
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,900
Guy, if you go to the police now...

379
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:28,279
...you'll just be turning yourself
in as an accessory.

380
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,824
You see, you have the motive.

381
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,000
- What is it?
- My telephone.

382
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,256
Someone has some news for you, Guy.

383
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,096
It's the police.

384
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,459
You've got me acting
like I'm a criminal.

385
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,421
Why, you crazy fool!

386
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,467
Don't you call me that.

387
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:38,766
Oh. Oh, you must be tired, Guy.
I know I am.

388
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,477
I've had a strenuous evening.

389
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:46,899
But now, about my father, I've got
the plan of the house already made.

390
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:51,070
And I have an old Luger pistol I got
in a pawnshop in San Francisco...

391
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:55,658
But, Guy... Guy, wait a minute! We have
to talk. We have to arrange things.

392
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,160
Go, before I give you
what you gave Miriam.

393
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,871
You're not yourself, Guy.
You're tired.

394
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,750
When you think things over,
you'll see I'm right. Tomorrow, we...

395
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:08,462
I never saw you before!
I never want to see you again!

396
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,005
But we have...

397
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,854
Yes? Yes, Anne.

398
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,773
I'm sorry, darling. I just got in.

399
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,694
Of course I'm all right,
but you sound upset.

400
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,612
Is anything wrong?

401
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,783
All right. I'll come over right away.

402
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,558
Anne, darling, you're trembling.

403
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:12,818
Guy, I wonder if you know
how much I love you.

404
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,155
Brazen woman, I'm the one to say that.

405
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,208
I wanted you to know before...

406
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,961
Father wants to see you.

407
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,190
Good evening, sir.

408
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,947
Hello, Babs.

409
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,911
- Something dreadful's happened.
- Sit down, Barbara.

410
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:12,878
There seems to be no way of
diplomatically breaking tragic news.

411
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,215
I'm sorry, Guy,
to be the one to tell you.

412
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,509
It concerns your wife.

413
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,137
She's been murdered.

414
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,307
- The police have been trying
to find you.

415
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,102
- You're to call headquarters
in Metcalf.

416
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,274
Miriam murdered?

417
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,818
She was strangled.

418
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,533
It happened on an island,
in an amusement park.

419
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,244
It was sort of a lovers' lane,
I believe.

420
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,162
Evidently, a sordid atmosphere.

421
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:51,083
She went there with the boys that
found her, so they're not suspects.

422
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,585
But you will be.

423
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:55,838
We can't overlook that murder
is at our doorstep...

424
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,590
...but don't drag it in here.

425
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,425
Let's not fool ourselves.

426
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:02,887
Police will say Guy wanted her dead
so he could marry Anne.

427
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:06,015
This sort of crime,
they go after the husband.

428
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,558
Guy had every motive.

429
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,269
Motive?

430
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,187
Well, she's right.

431
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,608
Whichever way you look at it,
I'm in a spot.

432
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,444
I'm sure you've got nothing
to worry about.

433
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:22,406
If he hasn't an alibi for 9:30,
he has plenty to worry about.

434
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:25,492
- You can tell them where you were.
- Sherry.

435
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,202
Thank you.

436
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,371
Can't you, Guy?

437
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:32,750
Nine-thirty? I was on the train
from New York to Washington.

438
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,209
There you are.

439
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,755
Who saw you? Did you speak to anyone?
You'll need a witness.

440
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,090
Yes, I did speak to someone.

441
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,010
- Someone you know?
- No.

442
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,887
His name was...

443
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:48,807
C... Col... Collins! He's a professor.

444
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,811
- Harvard?
- Delaware Tech.

445
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,523
Then everything's all right.

446
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,818
Not quite.
He'll still have to answer questions.

447
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,403
Routine. Pure routine.

448
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:04,406
There'll be many reporters here
in the morning.

449
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:08,327
Daddy doesn't mind a little scandal.
He's a senator.

450
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,290
It can't be helped, darling.
It's not your fault.

451
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,085
No one can say you had anything
to do with it.

452
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:23,676
Someone might say it. I'd do anything
to keep you all out of this mess.

453
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,179
Be guided by my experience.

454
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,558
Never lose any sleep over accusations.
Unless they can be proved, of course.

455
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,813
Dreadful business. Dreadful.
Poor, unfortunate girl.

456
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,523
She was a tramp.

457
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,024
She was a human being.

458
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:43,362
Even the most unworthy of us has a right
to life and the pursuit of happiness.

459
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,365
From what I hear,
she pursued it in all directions.

460
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,200
Barbara!

461
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,288
Father, it's getting terribly late.
Guy looks so tired.

462
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,208
Of course, of course.
Back to bed, Barbara.

463
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:00,337
Nothing stands in your way.
Now you can be married right away.

464
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,131
Think of it, you're free!

465
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,591
You don't always have
to say what you think.

466
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,468
Father, I am not a politician.

467
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,512
Remember to call Captain Turley.

468
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,764
Yes, sir. Good night.

469
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:14,184
- Anne...
- It'd be wonderful...

470
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,438
...to have a man love you
so much he'd kill for you.

471
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,901
I kept saying over and over
I was being silly.

472
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:27,448
But there was one horrible moment
tonight when the news came through.

473
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:31,452
I kept remembering what you shouted
on the phone from Metcalf.

474
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,078
That I could...

475
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,248
Don't even say it.

476
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,500
Forget you ever said it.

477
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,420
Even more terrifying
than the murder itself was...

478
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:45,007
...the horrible thought that
if you had done it...

479
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:48,969
...we would have been separated.
Perhaps forever.

480
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,013
I couldn't stand that.

481
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,890
I couldn't bear it.

482
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:09,156
Captain Turley is expecting me.
Guy Haines.

483
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,450
Just a moment, Mr. Haines.

484
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,213
Would you come in, please?

485
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,637
Good of you to be so prompt,
Mr. Haines.

486
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:33,847
- This is Lieutenant Campbell.
- How do you do?

487
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,141
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you, sir.

488
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:40,646
I know you're busy, so we won't detain
you any longer than necessary.

489
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:45,192
You've already been good enough to
tell us where you were last evening.

490
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,153
We've found the gentleman you spoke
with on the train.

491
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,031
- I saw him outside.
- Please come in, professor.

492
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,498
Professor Collins,
this is Mr. Haines.

493
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,668
He was with you on the train last night.

494
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:07,381
I'm sorry, but I really don't
remember meeting this gentleman.

495
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:12,970
Unfortunately, I remember very little
of our trip from New York.

496
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,390
You see, we had a little celebration.

497
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,476
But we were sitting
opposite each other...

498
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,687
...in the observation car.

499
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,190
- You were singing a song about a goat.
- A goat?

500
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,068
- And calculus.
You were going over a speech you made.

501
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,070
I was?

502
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,240
I'm very sorry, Mr. Haines.

503
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,909
I certainly must
have been celebrating.

504
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:44,293
Captain, is it so important whether
Professor Collins remembers me?

505
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,005
I've been able to name a man
who was on the train with me.

506
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,673
You've found him.

507
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:53,218
Isn't that proof of where I was
at 9:30 last night?

508
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,182
Thank you.
Hello, dear. Senator. Babs.

509
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,268
- Hello, darling. Have you had dinner?
- On the train.

510
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,980
You've been in Metcalf all this time?
We expected you hours ago.

511
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,276
I didn't. They sometimes leave
a suspect in the can all night.

512
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,404
Sit down, Guy. Sit down.
Barbara, some coffee.

513
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,240
You had no trouble with the police...

514
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,618
...once they verified your alibi?

515
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,787
When an alibi is full of bourbon,
it can't stand up.

516
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,498
You mean the professor was boiled?

517
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,042
Completely.

518
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,585
He didn't remember me.

519
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:31,673
But you knew he was on the train.
Isn't that proof you were on it too?

520
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,134
Apparently, not at the right time.

521
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,763
They suggested I could have caught
the train at Baltimore...

522
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,140
...after Miriam was murdered.

523
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,602
They had it all worked out
in their timetable.

524
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,981
Well, that's ridiculous.
They're acting as if you were guilty.

525
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,318
Everything will be all right.

526
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,112
The police were just being thorough.

527
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,073
Weren't they, Daddy?

528
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,202
I certainly hope so.
What's your next move?

529
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,165
Whatever it is,
the police will know about it.

530
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,502
Oh. Oh, they gave me a present.

531
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,630
Take a look.

532
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,426
My guardian angel.

533
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,345
You're being tailed.

534
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,014
That's Leslie Hennessy.

535
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,724
He works 16 hours a day.

536
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,394
Somebody else takes over
for the next eight.

537
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,688
Actually, he's a very nice fellow.

538
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,564
I'll have him called off.

539
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,401
Obstructing the wheels
ofjustice, Daddy?

540
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,779
I'm afraid where I go, Hennessy goes.

541
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,698
Even to the Senate.

542
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:42,619
- Is he likely to picket my office?
- Very likely.

543
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,875
I would suggest, for your own
peace of mind, of course...

544
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:53,088
...that you work at the house.
It'll be less embarrassing for you.

545
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:57,718
But what about practicing? Perhaps
I'd better forget about Forest Hills.

546
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,262
My dear boy...

547
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:05,267
...wouldn't it look rather awkward if
you suddenly canceled all your plans?

548
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,812
He's right. You mustn't do anything
that looks suspicious.

549
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:13,984
- You must act as if nothing happened.
- Escorted by Mr. Hennessy.

550
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,656
A call for you, Mr. Haines.
They say it's urgent.

551
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,283
Thank you.

552
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,702
Excuse me.

553
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,246
- Hello?
- Hello, Guy.

554
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:32,961
It must have been some mistake.
It wasn't for me.

555
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,430
I suppose I was lucky
being seeded fifth.

556
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:48,602
I've never seen the Forest Hills
tournament. I look forward to it.

557
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,188
You mean we'll be going
together, Hennessy?

558
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:55,692
Ah, don't worry. By that time,
this thing will be all cleared up.

559
00:44:56,778 --> 00:45:00,280
- You ever think of turning professional?
- I don't have to do that.

560
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,741
After tennis, I'm going into politics.

561
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,536
- I hope.
- Politics?

562
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,289
It's good I don't report that
to the chief.

563
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,126
If he knew that, he'd put 10 men
on you. He says...

564
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,629
Let's take this cab.
It's getting late.

565
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,966
- Pentagon building, please.
- Oh, no, not there.

566
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,177
I always get lost.

567
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,744
We'd better be getting back.

568
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:34,583
We've actually been alone for an hour.
Seems almost indecent.

569
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,126
You like?

570
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,586
I like.

571
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,464
I was beginning to feel like a goldfish.

572
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,424
Guy!

573
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,305
Excuse me.

574
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,021
Will you stop pestering me?

575
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:59,983
You're spoiling everything. You're making
me come out into the open.

576
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:04,362
I've tried calling you on the phone.

577
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,406
Did you get my note?

578
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:10,660
Why haven't you called me? My father
is leaving for Florida next week.

579
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:15,123
Listen, you... There's a detective
outside. He'll see us together.

580
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,669
Isn't that Anne Morton?

581
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:25,717
Slight improvement
over Miriam, huh, Guy?

582
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:29,679
Stay away from me, I'm telling you.

583
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,852
Who is it, Guy?

584
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,147
I never saw him before.
Just some tennis fan.

585
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,657
Here's a special delivery.
It's marked "personal."

586
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:51,701
- Thank you.
- You getting any practice today?

587
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,162
Yes, if I can get a court at the club.

588
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:59,459
- Barbara, who are you waving at?
- Mr. Hennessy.

589
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,379
It's a shame Daddy won't let us
have him in.

590
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,091
- You met him yet, Louise?
- No.

591
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:07,717
He's awfully cute.

592
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,607
- Hi.
- Hi.

593
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,776
- Hello, Guy.
- Hello.

594
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,687
Okay, you ready, Guy?

595
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,815
Yeah.

596
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:26,171
Hi, darling. This is Mr. Anthony, a friend
of Monsieur and Madame Darville.

597
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:27,672
Guy Haines.

598
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,717
I've been a fan for a long time,
Mr. Haines.

599
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,677
I follow everything you do.

600
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:37,599
Mr. Anthony has been telling us
some charming stories. Very funny.

601
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:01,456
Guy.

602
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,502
I've been talking to your shadow.

603
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,713
Guy, did you know Mr. Hennessy
helped crack that ax murder?

604
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,258
The one with the body cut up
and hidden in the butcher shop?

605
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,553
He was locked in the icebox
with the left leg for six hours.

606
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:18,139
He pulls those things out of his hat.

607
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,309
Who's the interesting Frenchman
with the Darvilles?

608
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,604
His name's Anthony.

609
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,690
He's not French.

610
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,487
- How are you?
- Delightful to see you, Barbara.

611
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,072
How sweet you look.

612
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:36,825
I hope you won't forget
our party on Thursday, madame.

613
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,661
- We're planning on it.
- But of course.

614
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,747
- This is my sister.
Barbara, this is Mr. Anthony.

615
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:44,999
How do you do?

616
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,383
Is your name Miriam?

617
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,797
- Hi, Hennessy.
- Hi.

618
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,216
- I won't keep you out late tonight.
- Oh?

619
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,927
With Forest Hills tomorrow,
I've got to sleep.

620
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,679
That's too bad.

621
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,432
Hammond will be on duty
in a couple of hours.

622
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,809
I'd like to see him earn his salary.

623
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,187
Doesn't that bloodhound ever relax?

624
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:50,148
He sticks so close,
he's beginning to grow on me.

625
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,816
Like a fungus.

626
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,527
He thinks you're
a very suspicious character.

627
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:58,656
But then he doesn't trust anybody,
not even himself.

628
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,827
Come on, Hennessy.

629
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,121
- Don't forget your sleeping bag.
- Yeah.

630
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:08,458
If I wait too long on a sidewalk,
my feet get cold.

631
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:12,128
- If I sit too long on those stone steps...
- Don't worry.

632
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:16,174
Since you told Barbara about that
icebox, you're her favorite charity.

633
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:19,719
- She'll send a butler to defrost you.
- Cute kid.

634
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,100
Good evening, Miss Morton.

635
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:10,019
- This is Mr. Anthony, Father.
- Mr. Anthony.

636
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,063
How do you do, sir?

637
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,607
I'd like to talk
with you sometime, sir...

638
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:18,778
...and tell you about my idea
for harnessing a life force.

639
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,907
It'll make atomic power
look like the horse and buggy.

640
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:27,412
I'm already developing my faculty
for seeing millions of miles.

641
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:34,002
And, senator, can you imagine being able
to smell a flower on the planet Mars?

642
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:37,255
I'd like to have lunch
with you soon, sir...

643
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:39,007
...tell you more about it.
- Oh.

644
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,259
- I'll see you later.
- Goodbye.

645
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,391
I don't remember inviting him.
Who is he?

646
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,643
A friend of the Darvilles.

647
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,646
Unusual personality.

648
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:00,653
- Excuse me, aren't you Judge Donahue?
- That's right.

649
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:03,448
How do you do, sir?
My name is Bruno Anthony.

650
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,658
What's he doing here?

651
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,744
I don't know.

652
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:13,541
After you've sentenced
a man to the chair...

653
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:17,337
...isn't it difficult to go out
and eat your dinner after that?

654
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:24,344
When a murderer's caught, he's tried.
When convicted, he's sentenced.

655
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:27,388
When he's sentenced to death,
he must be executed.

656
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:28,848
Oh.

657
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,434
- Quite impersonal, isn't it?
- So it is.

658
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,354
Besides, it doesn't happen every day.

659
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,773
So few murderers are caught.

660
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:40,735
Mr. Anthony, you seem very interested
in the subject of murder.

661
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,487
No more than anyone else.

662
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:45,281
- No more than you, for instance.
- Me? Oh.

663
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,575
I'm not interested in murder.

664
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:51,329
Oh, come now.
Everyone is interested in that.

665
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,791
Everyone has somebody that
they want to put out of the way.

666
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,710
Surely, madam,
hasn't there been a time...

667
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,588
...that you didn't want to dispose
of someone?

668
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,510
- Your husband, for instance?
- Oh, good heavens, no!

669
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,595
Are you sure?

670
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:12,392
You mean there wasn't a tiny moment
when you were made very angry?

671
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,268
What did you say?

672
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:19,691
Aha. There you are, you see?
There you are.

673
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:21,943
Now...

674
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,861
...you're going to do a murder.

675
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:28,116
How are you going to do it?
That's the fascinating part.

676
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,743
How will you do it...?
I didn't get your name.

677
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,203
Mrs. Cunningham.

678
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:34,747
Mrs. Cunningham,
how are you going to do it?

679
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:38,251
Well, I suppose I'll have to
get a gun from somewhere.

680
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,878
Oh, no, Mrs. Cunningham.

681
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,382
Bang, bang, bang, all over the place?
Blood everywhere?

682
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,843
- How about a little poison?
- Yes.

683
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:50,972
- Oh, that's better. That's better, Mrs...
- Anderson.

684
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,057
That's better, Mrs. Anderson.

685
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:56,644
But, you see, Mrs. Cunningham
is in a dreadful hurry.

686
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,980
Poison takes from 10 to 12 weeks...

687
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:02,150
...if poor Mr. Cunningham is to die
from natural causes.

688
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,237
You know, I read of a case once.

689
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,157
I think it would be a wonderful idea.

690
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:13,161
I can take him in the car and
when we get to a very lonely spot...

691
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:17,248
...hit him on the head with a hammer,
pour gasoline over him and the car...

692
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:20,168
...and set the whole thing ablaze.

693
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,587
And walk all the way home?

694
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,214
- No?
- Oh, no. No, no.

695
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,509
I have the best way
and the best tools.

696
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,181
Simple, silent and quick. The silent
part being the most important.

697
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,016
Let me show you what I mean.

698
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,477
May I borrow your neck for a moment?

699
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:41,647
- Well, if it's not for long.
- Oh.

700
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:54,786
When I nod my head, you try to cry
out, and I'll bet you can't do it.

701
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,288
All right, now.

702
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:00,291
Just wait for the nod of my head.

703
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:33,908
MRS.- Mr. Anthony! Help!
Help! Somebody, come quick! Help!

704
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,537
Somebody, come.
Quick, bring some water.

705
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:49,423
- Let's get him out of here.
- Bring him into the study.

706
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,177
Will you help me
take her upstairs, please?

707
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:56,139
- What happened?
- He seemed to have fainted.

708
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,599
- What about her?
- She was frightened.

709
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,102
They were playing a game of some sort.

710
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:11,320
I thought he was weird
when he arrived. Who is he?

711
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,989
I hardly know him, sir.

712
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:16,033
Get him out of here
as soon as you decently can.

713
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:18,202
It's a nice item for the gossips.

714
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:21,289
First thing you know,
they'll be talking about orgies.

715
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,833
- I better get back.
- Yes, sir.

716
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:36,971
What happened?

717
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:41,142
I was on a merry-go-round somewhere.
It made me dizzy.

718
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:45,521
You mad, crazy maniac!
You ought to be locked up.

719
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,649
Will you get out of here
and let me alone?

720
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,485
But, Guy...

721
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,904
...I like you.

722
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,831
You shouldn't have done that, Guy.

723
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,459
Come on, pull yourself together.

724
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,760
Here, let me.

725
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,765
Is your car here?

726
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,684
Driver's outside.

727
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,353
All right, come on.

728
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,503
What's the matter?

729
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,672
Did you see it happen?

730
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,548
He looked at me.

731
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,719
His hands were on her throat...

732
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,305
...and he was strangling me.

733
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,891
How do you mean?

734
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:08,229
He was looking at her first...

735
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,398
...then looked over at me.

736
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,194
He went into sort of a trance.

737
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,615
Oh, it was horrible.

738
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,707
He thought he was murdering me.

739
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,212
But why me, Anne? Why me?

740
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,924
What did I have to do with it?

741
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,013
Do you know where Guy is?

742
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,224
He went out with that man.

743
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:50,479
Excuse me.

744
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,944
Guy.

745
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:11,334
You didn't meet him for the first time
the other day, did you?

746
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,337
- When you introduced us at the club?
- Yes.

747
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:18,883
- Did you see how he stared at Barbara?
- No, I didn't particularly.

748
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,635
He stared at her
the same way tonight...

749
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:24,764
...while his hands were around
Mrs. Cunningham's throat.

750
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,601
What did Miriam look like?

751
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:32,355
Why ask me?
You've seen her picture.

752
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,482
Go on. I want you to tell me.

753
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:38,527
- She was dark, not too tall, rather pretty.
- What else?

754
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:40,029
What else is there?

755
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:44,033
She wore glasses, didn't she, Guy?

756
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,701
Yes.

757
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:49,038
She looked something like Barbara,
didn't she?

758
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,003
How did you get him to do it?

759
01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:59,673
I get him to do it?

760
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:03,219
He killed Miriam, didn't he?

761
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,555
Tell me, didn't he?

762
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,516
Yes.

763
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:12,019
He's a maniac. I met him
on the train going to Metcalf.

764
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:16,607
He had a crazy scheme about exchanging
murders. I do his, he'd do mine.

765
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,527
What do you mean, your murder, Guy?

766
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,822
He read about me. He knew
about Miriam, about you.

767
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:27,034
He suggested if he got rid of Miriam
for me, I should kill his father.

768
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,037
You must've known
he was talking nonsense.

769
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:33,124
But he wasn't.
I didn't give it another thought.

770
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:37,002
And now a lunatic wants me
to kill his father.

771
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:39,505
It's too fantastic.

772
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,049
Yes, isn't it?

773
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:45,553
You mean, you've known about Miriam
all this time?

774
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:48,806
Since the first night.
He gave me her glasses.

775
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:51,267
Why didn't you call the police?

776
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,894
And have them say what you did:

777
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,231
"Mr. Haines, how did you get him
to do it?"

778
01:02:57,566 --> 01:03:00,317
And Bruno would say
we planned it together.

779
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:05,656
Oh, Guy, what are we gonna do?

780
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,451
I don't know, Anne. I don't know.

781
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:12,163
- We'd better go inside.
Your friend Hennessy is watching us.

782
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:15,791
You see, this is why I didn't want you
to know anything about it.

783
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:19,336
I wanted to protect all of you.
Barbara, your father.

784
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:22,047
Now that you know,
you're acting guilty too.

785
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,428
If we could only talk to Father, to...

786
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,432
It's not good.
I mustn't drag anyone else into this.

787
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:35,144
Come on, let's go.

788
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:42,067
Hello, Hammond.

789
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:45,863
You look worried.

790
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:49,116
Keep on your toes.
Something funny's going on.

791
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:08,969
Bruno?

792
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:11,472
Yes, yes, it's Guy.

793
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:14,141
I've decided to do what you want.

794
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,102
I'll make that little visit
to your father.

795
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,605
How about tonight?

796
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,734
Yes, I want to get
this thing over with.

797
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,819
Does anyone know you've come home?

798
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:30,199
You'd better slip out again
and stay out till after daylight.

799
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:55,028
Mr. Anthony.

800
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:59,408
Don't be alarmed, but I must talk
to you about your son, about Bruno.

801
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,580
Yes, Mr. Haines?

802
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,839
My father isn't home tonight,
Mr. Haines.

803
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,467
I was about to tell you that
on the phone.

804
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:19,052
But you made such a sudden decision.

805
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,054
I wondered why.

806
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:24,641
Since you sent me the key
to your house, I decided to use it...

807
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:27,561
...to make a little social call
on your father.

808
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:31,273
I thought he'd be interested to know
he has a lunatic son.

809
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:39,448
I assume that you have no intention
of going ahead with our arrangement?

810
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,951
None whatsoever. I never had.

811
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:45,078
I see.

812
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,415
Well, then you'll have
no further use for my key.

813
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,421
Nor this.

814
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:59,802
Look, Bruno.
You're terribly sick.

815
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:04,264
I don't know much about these things,
but why don't you get some treatment?

816
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:05,933
Not only for your sake...

817
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,435
...but you can't go on
causing destruction...

818
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:10,479
...to anyone you happen to meet.

819
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:17,152
I don't like to be double-crossed.

820
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:22,199
I have a murder on my conscience,
but it's not my murder.

821
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,034
It's yours.

822
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,245
And since you're the one to profit by it...

823
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,831
...I think you should be
the one to pay for it.

824
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,000
Well, I guess it's no use, Bruno.

825
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:35,128
We seem to have nothing further
to discuss.

826
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:22,259
Don't worry.
I'm not going to shoot you.

827
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,511
It might disturb Mother.

828
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:26,847
I'm a very clever fellow.

829
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,851
I'll think of something better
than that. Much better.

830
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:45,782
He came back at 3:25.
I didn't even know he was gone...

831
01:10:46,034 --> 01:10:48,285
...until his phone rang
for half an hour.

832
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,455
Nobody sleeps that sound,
so the janitor let me in.

833
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:53,206
- No Haines.
- I wonder where he went.

834
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:56,209
- Probably hear of another dame murdered.
- Shut up.

835
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,045
How about I contact Metcalf?

836
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:00,589
I think there's cause
for more questioning.

837
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:02,883
Questioning? Let's take him in.

838
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,384
My dear Mr. Hammond...

839
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:08,096
...how many times must I tell you
that we have nothing conclusive?

840
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:12,935
There's no evidence he was ever at
the crime scene. Can't you get that?

841
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,604
Now, just stay put till I get back.

842
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:23,236
Miss Morton, really.

843
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,740
I know Bruno's been
in some very awkward scrapes...

844
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,409
...but nothing so ridiculous
as a murder.

845
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:33,413
Mrs. Anthony, you have to make him
do something about this.

846
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,582
Don't you see that one word
from him...

847
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:38,251
...would get Guy out
of this dreadful situation?

848
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,920
But, Miss Morton...

849
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:44,549
...I'm sure that this whole thing
is just some practical joke.

850
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:48,929
You know, Bruno, he sometimes goes
a little too far.

851
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:54,101
I really shouldn't be saying
this to an outsider...

852
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:57,813
...but sometimes he's
terribly irresponsible...

853
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:01,358
...and gets into all kinds
of escapades.

854
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:04,277
Don't you understand, Mrs. Anthony?

855
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:07,656
Your son is responsible
for a woman's death.

856
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,117
Did Bruno tell you this?

857
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,619
Well, of course not, Mrs. Anthony.

858
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,121
Well, there you are.

859
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:18,375
Well, now, Miss Morton,
it's very nice of you to call...

860
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:21,628
...and if you'll excuse me,
I must get back to my painting.

861
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:25,382
Do you care for painting, Miss Morton?

862
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:28,135
I find it very soothing.

863
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,472
Come see us again sometime.

864
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:47,821
Oh, Miss Morton.

865
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:52,034
I'm afraid that Mother wasn't
very much help, was she?

866
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:54,619
She hasn't been well
for a long time.

867
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:57,706
She's a little... How shall I say?
Confused.

868
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,541
Poor Mother.

869
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,336
You know, I'm very upset with Guy.

870
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:06,882
He shouldn't have sent you
on an errand like this.

871
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:09,760
Guy doesn't know I'm here,
Mr. Anthony.

872
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:13,180
He's led you up the garden path,
I'm afraid.

873
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:19,603
He must be very desperate
to try to involve me.

874
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:23,106
I've been protecting him since
that conversation on the train...

875
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:26,026
...when he told me
how much he hated his wife.

876
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:35,535
He tried to get me to go back
to the island one night after dark...

877
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:39,039
...to pick up his lighter
so the police wouldn't find it?

878
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:43,376
He dropped it there, you know, when...
Well, that night.

879
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,213
All the police are waiting for...

880
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,633
...is one piece of evidence
to convict Guy of the murder.

881
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:52,719
It's had me so worried.

882
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:56,932
But, of course, I couldn't do it.
It would be too risky.

883
01:13:57,225 --> 01:14:00,435
And besides, it would make me
an accessory.

884
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:06,483
Oh, Miss Morton.
I understand how you feel.

885
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:10,403
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have an urgent appointment.

886
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:14,032
I really must go now.

887
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,109
He said if the police found
your lighter...

888
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:52,279
...that's all they'd need to prove
you were at the scene.

889
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:57,117
That lie about my wanting him to get
it back means he'll put it on that island.

890
01:14:57,285 --> 01:15:00,745
I wanted to help, but I'm afraid
all I did is make things worse.

891
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:03,790
Going there after you did
only made him more furious.

892
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,836
No, darling. He said last night
he'd think of something.

893
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,255
He certainly has.

894
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:14,050
Guy, you've got to get to Metcalf
before he does.

895
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,761
You haven't time to play.
You'd better tell them.

896
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:20,640
If they announce I won't play,
Hennessy's bound to be suspicious.

897
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:22,851
He'll keep me from
getting near Metcalf.

898
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:25,145
- Well, then I'll go.
- No, Anne.

899
01:15:25,313 --> 01:15:28,523
Stay here and help me give
Hennessy the slip after the match.

900
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:29,983
But that'll be too late.

901
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:33,904
Didn't Bruno say I wanted him to go
there one night after dark?

902
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,198
- Yes.
- That's what's in his mind now.

903
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,658
He won't expose himself
in broad daylight.

904
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:41,661
If I can finish
in three sets, I'll still...

905
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,830
You're on in a few minutes, Guy.

906
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,000
- Miss Morton.
- Okay, Tim. I'll be right there.

907
01:15:48,336 --> 01:15:50,503
This is what I think we'd better do.

908
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:54,716
- If Turley said to, let's pick him up.
- Let him have his game first.

909
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,385
First time I ever waited
for a murder suspect...

910
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,721
...to play tennis before
I pulled him in.

911
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:03,683
The boys at headquarters hear
about this, they'll send me...

912
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:09,105
- Good luck, Guy.
- Thanks.

913
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,110
You got it straight.

914
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:18,281
Make sure Barbara has everything ready
as soon as the third set starts.

915
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:44,140
- Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

916
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:46,393
This men's singles match will be...

917
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:50,397
...between Mr. Guy Haines
and Mr. Fred Reynolds.

918
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:04,786
On the other hand, Guy Haines is
a quiet, methodical player...

919
01:17:04,996 --> 01:17:06,246
...almost lackadaisical.

920
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:10,250
As a rule, he plays slowly
between points, well within himself.

921
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:11,876
Linesmen ready?

922
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:13,753
Play.

923
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,137
15-love.

924
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,020
30-love.

925
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:44,826
30-15.

926
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:57,547
40-15.

927
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,059
Fault.

928
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:26,326
- Game, Mr. Haines.
He leads, one game to love, first set.

929
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,047
Union Station.

930
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:48,431
Guy Haines is hitting harder,
hurrying the play...

931
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:50,850
...taking chances
I've never seen him take.

932
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:54,604
This is a complete reversal
of his usual watch-and-wait strategy.

933
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,198
40-30.

934
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:53,079
Oh, may I have a light, please?

935
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:07,093
Thanks.

936
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:23,943
- Game, Mr. Haines.
He leads, one game to love. Third set.

937
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:26,613
Guy Haines has caught
the first two sets easily.

938
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:30,158
And if he keeps going, it'll be
a straight-set win for him, sure.

939
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:34,954
Look, if he wins this next set,
you'd better have everything ready.

940
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,582
Give the driver this $10.

941
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:40,084
I wish I understood
what this is all about.

942
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:42,629
I'll tell you that later.
Please hurry.

943
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:15,870
40-love.

944
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:31,844
Game, Mr. Reynolds.

945
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,556
Advantage, Mr. Reynolds.

946
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:38,434
Game, Mr. Reynolds.
He leads.

947
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:40,853
I may have spoken too soon
when I said...

948
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,022
...this match looked
to be about over.

949
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:45,400
Reynolds is up there
knocking on the door.

950
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:01,541
Game, Mr. Reynolds.

951
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,793
Mr. Reynolds wins the third set.

952
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:06,963
Mr. Haines leading, two sets to one.

953
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:43,916
The set score is now 2-1.
Guy Haines leading...

954
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:46,085
...and we're 10-all
in the fourth set.

955
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:50,214
This match, from a quick victory
for Haines, has turned into a dogfight.

956
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,351
30-all.

957
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,982
Down there. My cigarette case.
It's very valuable.

958
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:11,277
- Down here?
- Yes, get that grating up right away.

959
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:12,737
What's the trouble?

960
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,573
Can't we do something?
I dropped my cigarette case.

961
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:18,868
It mightn't be any good.
Probably gone down the storm drain.

962
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:21,537
- Storm drain?
- Maybe it lodged on the edge.

963
01:23:21,789 --> 01:23:24,957
Don't they have a trap down there,
like under a sink?

964
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,293
Don't just stand here, do something!

965
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:29,879
I guess we could phone
the city engineer.

966
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:32,799
- Worst he could do is tell me to take...
- No, look, mister.

967
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:36,469
- Relax, mister.
- I don't want to relax.

968
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,521
Game, Mr. Haines.

969
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,606
Guy Haines is grim and determined.

970
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:51,776
He needs but one more game
for the entire match.

971
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,144
40-30.

972
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,980
Just one point between Haines
and the match!

973
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:37,864
Deuce.

974
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:54,839
Advantage, Mr. Haines.

975
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:04,807
Deuce.

976
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,080
Advantage, Mr. Haines.

977
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:49,268
- You must think a lot of that,
whatever it is.

978
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:57,985
Game, set and match, Mr. Haines.

979
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:16,128
Taxi's waiting at the entrance.

980
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:27,974
Isn't it wonderful? He won.
It calls for a celebration.

981
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,810
- Oh, I'm so sorry. Let me.
- It's quite all right.

982
01:26:30,978 --> 01:26:34,230
No, please. Anne says you
must have dinner with us tonight...

983
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:37,483
...just the family and you and Guy.
- I may be out of town.

984
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,777
But you'll be with Guy, surely?

985
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:41,737
- Hennessy!
- I'm sorry. I wish I could.

986
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,739
Hennessy!

987
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:51,163
- You waiting for me?
- Yes.

988
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:52,665
Penn Station.

989
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:02,216
Come on.

990
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,848
We need your help.
We're chasing a man.

991
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:12,018
Really? How exciting!

992
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,503
Where'd that man buy a ticket for?

993
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:21,963
- Metcalf.
- Let's get him.

994
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,549
That's why we're not. Let him go.
This may lead to something big.

995
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:28,552
We'll phone Metcalf and let
them take over at that end.

996
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:57,581
What time does it get dark
around here?

997
01:29:00,127 --> 01:29:01,961
What's the hurry?

998
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:05,464
- What time does it get dark, I said?
- Oh, soon enough.

999
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,808
- Excuse me.
- It's quite all right.

1000
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:19,353
- When do we get into Baltimore?
- In about 30 minutes.

1001
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:21,564
Late again, hmm?

1002
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:29,822
Nice business he's doing
since the murder.

1003
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:32,074
People wanna see the scene
of the crime.

1004
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:35,286
- Come on, come on.
Come closer. Here we are.

1005
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:37,997
It's not a very nice way
to make money.

1006
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,958
Well, heck.
Boat-keepers gotta eat too.

1007
01:29:41,168 --> 01:29:43,669
Business fell off something terrible
for a while.

1008
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:46,589
The smoochers wouldn't
go near the place.

1009
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:50,134
I'm afraid I don't know
what a smoocher is.

1010
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:53,846
Okay. So I ain't educated.

1011
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,051
Amusement park. Quick.

1012
01:30:40,227 --> 01:30:42,436
He's gone to the amusement park.

1013
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:46,398
Car 61 F, reporting Guy Haines'
arrival at railroad station.

1014
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:48,859
Suspect bound for amusement park
in taxi.

1015
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:05,853
There he is now.

1016
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:09,982
Pick up Johnny and follow him.
We'll go around the other way.

1017
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:26,123
Keep your eyes open.
If you see him, let us know.

1018
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:43,515
Any more boats?

1019
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:53,651
It'll be a few minutes' wait.

1020
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:26,225
Hey, Bruno!

1021
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,854
- Haines, hold it!
- Bruno!

1022
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,606
Haines, hold it!

1023
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:53,085
Bruno! Give me that lighter!

1024
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,759
- Now, stay back, please!
- Coming through.

1025
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:06,432
- He's on there, sir.
- He's the one who killed her.

1026
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:07,933
We know that.

1027
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:17,443
- Get someone to stop this thing.
- I can handle it.

1028
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,200
Hey, be careful! Stop!

1029
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:28,954
- Well, do you want to do it?
- No, I guess he can make it all right.

1030
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:53,103
My little boy!

1031
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:57,024
My little boy!

1032
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:01,445
Please.

1033
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:19,750
- Are you all right, Haines?
- I think so.

1034
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:22,961
He says this isn't the man we want.
It's the other one.

1035
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:25,923
- The one he was fighting with.
- What do you mean?

1036
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,132
Not Haines?

1037
01:37:27,509 --> 01:37:29,927
- But you pointed him out.
- No, I didn't, sir.

1038
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:33,263
I've never seen this man before.
I meant the other one.

1039
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:36,350
- What's this all about, Haines?
- He has my lighter.

1040
01:37:36,643 --> 01:37:40,145
He wanted to plant it on the island
to pin the whole thing on me.

1041
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:43,106
Let me talk to him. Let me show you.
Where is he?

1042
01:37:43,316 --> 01:37:45,776
Over here. Take it easy, pal.

1043
01:37:47,654 --> 01:37:50,489
- We can't move it.
It's too heavy.

1044
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:55,369
- He's in a bad way.
- Can't you get it off him?

1045
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:58,497
- They've done everything
they can till the crane comes.

1046
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:01,375
Hello, Guy.

1047
01:38:03,002 --> 01:38:04,378
Who's this?

1048
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:07,339
This is Mr. Turley,
the chief of police.

1049
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:10,384
Oh...

1050
01:38:13,096 --> 01:38:16,473
They got you at last, huh, Guy?

1051
01:38:17,684 --> 01:38:21,019
Bruno, can you talk a little?

1052
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:25,691
Can you tell the chief
you have my lighter?

1053
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:30,320
I haven't got it.

1054
01:38:31,698 --> 01:38:34,032
It's on the island where you left it.

1055
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:38,495
Bruno, don't keep it up,
not at a time like this.

1056
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:41,206
- You know that...
- I'm sorry, Guy.

1057
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:46,211
I want to help you,
but I don't know what I can do.

1058
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:50,549
Captain Turley, can't I go
through his pockets?

1059
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:53,552
Of course not.
Besides, he says he hasn't got it.

1060
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:55,637
I think he's going.

1061
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:02,519
He's finished.

1062
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:13,697
Is this it?

1063
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:16,241
Well, you were right.

1064
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:18,702
Better keep this for the time being.

1065
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:23,165
We'll clear this up in the morning.
How about staying overnight?

1066
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:26,918
I imagine there's a lot you want
to tell me. Nine o'clock all right?

1067
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:30,422
Okay, Captain Turley. Thanks.

1068
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:35,927
- Tell me where there's a telephone.
- Up near the entrance.

1069
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,929
Who was he, bud?

1070
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,015
Bruno.

1071
01:39:40,391 --> 01:39:44,186
Bruno Anthony. Very clever fellow.

1072
01:39:50,443 --> 01:39:52,194
Hello?

1073
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:54,613
Yes, operator, yes.

1074
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:57,449
Guy?

1075
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:03,580
Yes, darling, yes.
Well, of course I'll be there.

1076
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:05,874
Goodbye.

1077
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:10,253
Guy will be back tomorrow.
He wants me to bring him some...

1078
01:40:18,137 --> 01:40:21,723
I beg your pardon.
But aren't you Guy Haines?
