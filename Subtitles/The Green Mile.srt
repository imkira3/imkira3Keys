I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

a dead child on my conscience.

a gift like that...

...he's huge.

1391
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:20,861
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1392
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:25,240
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

...just leapt into my tiny friend here.

As for me...

1925

...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1926

...a gift, the way he saw it...

...so that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.
