1
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,724
Talon 1 requesting Bitching Betty
relay Combat Control commands.

2
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,401
Roger, Talon 1.

3
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:12,004
Central Prime is transmitting...

4
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,532
...encrypted satellite
auto-terrain comparison.

5
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,424
Talons, this is Operator.

6
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:18,872
PAYCOM has given
his final tasking orders.

7
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:23,268
You are to proceed to target
and prosecute with precision.

8
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:26,030
Now, remember,
you are pilots of the U.S. Navy.

9
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:29,345
I expect nothing less
than perfection.

10
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:32,237
Roger, skipper.
Activating tactical music.

11
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:35,267
Countermeasure is silent party.
Talon 2, confirm.

12
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,214
Talon 2 confirms. Music on.

13
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:39,560
Risk assessment is
we have a clean mission status.

14
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:41,199
Attack commencing.

15
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,612
Gotcha.

16
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:08,491
Missile lock. Missile lock.

17
00:02:08,886 --> 00:02:12,203
Talon 3, there's a SAM site on
the west wall. We got birds in the air.

18
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:27,913
Talon 2,
the SAM site's been erased.

19
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:30,180
Now, that's how you do it.

20
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,760
Talon 3, that was shit-hot!

21
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,723
Talon 1, I expect
the same out of you.

22
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:18,719
Arming Blue Ferret
for penetration detonation.

23
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:22,280
Missile armed. Missile armed.

24
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:03,150
Yep, 100 over 100.
That's correct.

25
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,457
And I can rely on these numbers?

26
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:10,046
Well, this isn't figure skating, Ray.
You either score or you don't.

27
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:12,294
National Command Authority's
duly impressed.

28
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,517
They've given us the go-ahead
on phase two.

29
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:15,988
You know what?

30
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:19,628
You should come to D.C. and make
the presentation to the senators.

31
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:22,553
That's how Admiral Rickover
got things done.

32
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,707
Admiral. You get my meaning?

33
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:27,737
No, I'm flattered,
but you do the lobbying.

34
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:29,551
Politics is for politicians.

35
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:33,545
- Captain?
- I'll get back to you.

36
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:36,091
There's Popsicles in the cooler.

37
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:37,739
- Got any grape?
- Any grape?

38
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:42,103
I believe there is one left,
and don't lose your dignity.

39
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:43,682
Oh, thank you.

40
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:47,129
- All right, take a seat.
- Nice catch.

41
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,793
Talk to me. Where are the holes?
How can we improve?

42
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:52,903
Come on. I'm not a patient man.

43
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,900
Sorry, I got caught up on
that west wall. I had to pull out...

44
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:58,422
War is a team sport.

45
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:01,885
Those AAA sites were thick.
Gave extra time to the SAM sites.

46
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:05,039
See, that's your answer. There really
was no room for improvement.

47
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:07,565
Actually, what Lieutenant Wade
did was right.

48
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,612
She took out their communications
and exposed their SAM sites...

49
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,006
...so Henry could lay it down.
- That's what I do.

50
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,920
- I mean, it was perfect.
- "Perfect." I'll go along with that.

51
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:19,818
Much as I hate to see that smile
of yours get any smugger.

52
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:21,753
You blushing?

53
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,786
I've got good news.

54
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:27,186
Tell us we got a carrier,
skipper, come on.

55
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,465
Affirmative.

56
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:30,407
The USS Abraham Lincoln.

57
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,422
Captain's an old classmate of mine,
Dick Marshfield.

58
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:36,886
- I believe you two know each other.
- He was the captain I told you about.

59
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:40,576
- Hell of a pilot in his day.
- He's black too. He's black.

60
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:43,548
I'm also gonna be expanding
your squadron.

61
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,056
On the carrier, you'll be joined
by a new wingman.

62
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:50,044
A fourth wingman?

63
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:53,623
Wait, I thought there were only
three Talons in existence.

64
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:57,238
What is the problem, Purcell?
You look like you been hit in the gut.

65
00:05:57,547 --> 00:06:00,776
For one, captain, we've been flying
together for a long time and it's good.

66
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,359
And four is an unlucky number.

67
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:05,548
- Unlucky?
- It's not a prime number.

68
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:08,089
Prime numbers can only be divided
by one or itself.

69
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:09,785
Three is prime. The Holy Trinity.

70
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:12,579
Thesis and antithesis come together
and form the synthesis...

71
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:16,506
This is not a seminar on metaphysics.
This is the U.S. Navy.

72
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:21,405
Now, we ship out Wednesday at 0500.
Dismissed.

73
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,007
Okay. If he'd let me finish,
I was gonna say...

74
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:27,918
...Three's Company, Three Stooges,
Three Musketeers, three-peat...

75
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:30,480
..."three strikes, you're out,"
"Three Times a Lady."

76
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:32,272
- Three dimensions.
- Three blind mice.

77
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:35,067
There's ménage à trois.
Don't forget that one.

78
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:39,383
To the original three.

79
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:41,215
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

80
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:43,628
- Cheers.
- And assorted guests.

81
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,005
Cheers.

82
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:04,749
I'll be back in a second.

83
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:08,354
I gotta go pee-pee.

84
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:10,564
That's nasty.

85
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,662
At least she's potty-trained.
I'll give her that.

86
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,424
- Chip O'Dell.
- No way.

87
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:23,761
Yeah, it's gotta be him. Hey, Henry,
our fourth wing. It's gotta be him.

88
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:27,033
He tried to manipulate his way into
the program, but you two beat him.

89
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:30,718
Yeah, but Becky Martinez
could fly circles around O'Dell.

90
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,757
- Two out of the four are women? No.
- Hey, you never know.

91
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:37,206
- God, you're such a chauvinist.
- Hold on, now, that's not true.

92
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:41,636
I bow down before the superiority
of the opposite sex in many respects.

93
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:43,227
But from time to time...

94
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,406
...I believe they should
bow down before me.

95
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:48,818
- Oh, please.
- Kara. Kara, listen. You're different.

96
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:51,132
- You are a singularity.
- Absolutely.

97
00:07:51,393 --> 00:07:53,084
You're a freak. Of nature.

98
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:56,197
- Well, thank you, Henry, I think.
- You are very welcome.

99
00:07:56,865 --> 00:07:58,687
You know what I think?

100
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,123
Don't think. Drink.

101
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:48,609
Have fun.

102
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:16,572
Spectacular night, huh?

103
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,651
- Dark and mysterious, sir.
- Don't you like surprises, Ben?

104
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:27,771
Well, here he comes now.

105
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:54,127
Meet your new wingman.

106
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,568
Allow me to introduce the future
of digital warfare. Tim?

107
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:16,695
Open for Tim, please.

108
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:25,736
Fuel, catalyzed A1 methane.

109
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:28,591
Exoskeleton,
metal-ceramic composite.

110
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,047
Aeroelastic wings.

111
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:35,751
Pulse detonation engine
with twin hybrid scramjet turbos.

112
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:39,563
EDI's sensors can pick out
a face five miles away.

113
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:43,596
So we'll take three. Drop the top
on mine, personalized license plate.

114
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:45,963
So this is one of these
smart UCAVs.

115
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:49,422
Well, technically you could call it
an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle.

116
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:52,031
But that would be like
calling this carrier a rowboat.

117
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:54,338
I feel you, captain.
I know a bit about this.

118
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,949
- This is quantum processing, right?
- Yeah, it's the first tested application.

119
00:11:58,271 --> 00:11:59,515
Ten terabits a second.

120
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:02,194
So if it's a UCAV,
why does it have a seat?

121
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:04,482
The cockpit's just
for testing and maintenance.

122
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:06,850
Otherwise, EDI flies all by himself.

123
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:09,585
You mean "itself," don't you, sir?

124
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:13,646
So this is what the fuss is all about.

125
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,307
You're looking
at VLO stealth, captain.

126
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,478
It's got a brain
like a quantum sponge.

127
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:23,370
And one day, its survivability
is going to fly right off the charts.

128
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:26,030
- Lieutenant Wade.
- It's good to meet you, sir.

129
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:29,420
It is a bag of chips, all right.

130
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,671
- Lieutenant Purcell.
- Honored to meet you, sir.

131
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,980
It will replace us all.

132
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:39,325
Looks and sounds
like science fiction, George.

133
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:41,619
Well, so did everything,
once upon a time.

134
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:43,703
Ain't that the truth.

135
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:46,125
Mr. Gannon.
Good to have you back.

136
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:50,465
Your first squadron tour still holds
some of the ship's most...

137
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,415
...impressive records.

138
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:55,341
Thank you, Captain Marshfield.
Records are made to be broken.

139
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:58,214
Rules too, if I remember
your philosophy.

140
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:01,115
Captain Cummings,
this is my X O, Mr. Carlson.

141
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,610
Carlson.

142
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,649
Why don't you meet me up on
the flight deck after you're through.

143
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:07,464
- You bet.
- Congratulations, George.

144
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:09,878
- Thank you.
- Good to see you again, Dick.

145
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:11,287
You too.

146
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,096
- It's humming.
- No, EDI's thinking.

147
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,675
- Thinking? Thinking about what, sir?
- You. All of you.

148
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:21,562
He's going over your files.
He's reviewing all your flight logs.

149
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:23,796
Let's take it for a spin,
see what it can do.

150
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:25,779
No, no, no. Tomorrow.

151
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,676
- First, you gotta do your homework.
- Homework?

152
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:33,898
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

153
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:38,815
"EDI UCAV. Extreme Deep Invader."

154
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:41,311
Yeah, I've been called that
a few times.

155
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:43,068
- I've heard that one.
- Yeah, right.

156
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:58,958
Well, hello, gorgeous.

157
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:24,894
Please, no pictures, please.
No pictures, please. Please.

158
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:28,565
Okay, take them.
Take them. Take them.

159
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:37,601
It's open.

160
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:39,852
Study break.

161
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,601
You are one big study break.

162
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:46,178
Just a natural.

163
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:48,699
So that is the appeal.

164
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,274
Okay, because I was really
wondering how you manage...

165
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:54,031
...to pull a rocket scientist
at every port.

166
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,391
You better be careful, Ben, you know.
Hair bleach causes cancer in rats.

167
00:14:58,717 --> 00:15:00,505
Well, I'm not a rat.
That's my appeal.

168
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:05,323
- You checking out the drone?
- Yeah.

169
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,859
Just barely skimmed the surface.

170
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:11,691
- We really are in the era of EDI.
- EDI.

171
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:15,052
Did I ever tell you
about that foster mother I had?

172
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,268
- The one who weighed 350 pounds?
- No.

173
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:22,345
Anyway, one day she comes home
with this Chihuahua, right?

174
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:24,812
Guess what she named him. Eddie.

175
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:28,174
- You know what I realized about you?
- What?

176
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,683
You got a foster mom
for every situation.

177
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:33,698
Hey, I lived through my childhood.
I may as well use it, right?

178
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:35,479
That's right.

179
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:42,428
So tell me, you think
Marshfield's right?

180
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:45,149
You think they're gonna trade us all in
for that machine?

181
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:49,073
No way. War is about tools.
Think about it.

182
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,223
Claws to clubs, bronze to steel.

183
00:15:51,468 --> 00:15:54,370
- Best guy with the best weapon wins.
- Or girl.

184
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:57,192
And we all know who that is,
don't we?

185
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,638
The dull thud
of a Ben Gannon compliment.

186
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:13,533
Well...

187
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:16,059
Oh, pardon my C cup.

188
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:21,301
Study break is over.

189
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:37,347
Good morning to the crew
of the USS Abraham Lincoln.

190
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:39,949
Remember, foreign-object debris
can ruin a jet engine.

191
00:16:40,217 --> 00:16:42,770
Let's keep our safety record.
Scour that deck.

192
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:46,883
Hey. Feel like we got older, Dick.
What the hell happened?

193
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,046
Don't complain.
You still got your hair.

194
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:51,529
Yeah. Some of it.

195
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,702
Look, truth be told...

196
00:16:56,966 --> 00:17:01,058
...I never wanted this little experiment
of yours on my ship.

197
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:04,012
Well, you're not
hurting my feelings, Dick.

198
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,445
Admiral Spelling shared
your point paper with me...

199
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,717
...and your objections
were duly noted.

200
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:12,907
- You always could work the politics.
- It's indispensable in a bureaucracy.

201
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,868
This isn't a bureaucracy,
not out here.

202
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:18,291
You rush a weapons system
into service...

203
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:22,231
...you shortcut an operational
test cycle, people might get killed.

204
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,268
You know I can't pick my nose here
without 7000 people approving it.

205
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,320
Nobody rushed a damn thing.

206
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:31,099
Program is just ahead of schedule.

207
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:35,660
You missed this.

208
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,002
I'm out first, boys.

209
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:43,033
I'm right on that ass.

210
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:46,086
After you, ladies.

211
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:20,174
Talon 2, airborne.

212
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:26,439
Talon 3, airborne.

213
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:34,611
Talon 1 is off and heading 2-5-4.

214
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:36,905
Deploying Unmanned Combat
Aerial Vehicle...

215
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,726
...Extreme Deep Invader now.

216
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:51,937
I never thought
we would see this day.

217
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:53,675
Me neither, sir.

218
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:14,672
UCAV EDI, you have launch.

219
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:48,808
One to UCAV.
Confirm flight link. Over.

220
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:52,274
Flight link confirmed, Talon 1.

221
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,126
It is good to be
part of the squadron.

222
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,931
What? Well, well, well. He can talk.

223
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:01,727
Big deal. I know a guy's BMW,
does exactly the same thing.

224
00:20:16,364 --> 00:20:17,542
Picture, please.

225
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,291
Aye, aye, sir.

226
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,464
Swarm logic activated.

227
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:28,774
All right, Ben.
EDI's here to learn from you.

228
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:32,209
So let's make sure these lessons
are up to speed, all right?

229
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,464
Well, then, let the schooling begin.

230
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:46,182
Captain Cummings.

231
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:52,539
Inside, please.

232
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,904
- What's the deal?
- You, sir, have a new tasking order.

233
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:02,810
One to wing, anybody got a visual
on the UCAV?

234
00:21:05,212 --> 00:21:06,674
- Negative, 1.
- Negative, 1.

235
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:08,344
We better find him and regroup.

236
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,558
Before it takes a crap
in its quantum pants.

237
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:11,996
Wait up. Hold on.

238
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:14,277
What the hell is he doing?

239
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:16,791
Here he comes. Here he comes.

240
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:19,708
I think little brother
is messing with us.

241
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:25,158
UCAV, your position is always
on my starboard side.

242
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,736
Other starboard.

243
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:39,290
That's hot.

244
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:43,063
Got no heart, but it sure can fly.
That's not bad for a tin man.

245
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:48,086
EDI, it's official. You got a call sign.
UCAV "Tin Man" EDI, the first.

246
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,570
- Operator to squadron.
- Go for Talons.

247
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:00,905
There's been a change of plans.

248
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:04,299
We're giving you an emergency
mission redirect. Repeat.

249
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:06,809
That's an emergency redirect.
Do you read me?

250
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:08,569
Roger. Where's the fire, skipper?

251
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,810
PAYCOM has given us
a brand-new tasking order.

252
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:13,869
Please access your encrypted file...

253
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:17,114
...named "Advanced
War Vector Scenarios."

254
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:19,827
File's open. Go ahead.

255
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:23,730
All right. Firewall code
is "Terror Summit."

256
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:28,531
We are upgrading this file from
a scenario to a tactical action plan.

257
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:30,521
Repeat, we are upgrading the file.

258
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:36,192
CIA human intel has just learned
that the heads of three terrorist cells...

259
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:39,505
...are about to meet in 24 minutes.

260
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,439
The country is Myanmar.
The city is Rangoon.

261
00:22:43,744 --> 00:22:45,883
They're planning an imminent attack
on U.S. soil.

262
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,455
One to Control,
what about the UCAV?

263
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:53,722
EDI will observe your attack.

264
00:22:54,188 --> 00:22:56,130
Proceed to primary.

265
00:22:56,823 --> 00:22:58,449
Roger.

266
00:22:58,692 --> 00:23:02,621
One to UCA V,
confirm observation status only.

267
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:06,879
Tin Man confirms, Talon 1.

268
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:10,756
New coordinates
have been uploaded.

269
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:15,614
Baptism by fire, Tin Man.

270
00:23:25,686 --> 00:23:27,475
Mach 1.

271
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:30,377
Mach 2.

272
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:33,367
Mach 3.

273
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:36,299
Mach 4.

274
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,067
Primo's now analyzing the location.
Here we go.

275
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,592
The primary is this building.

276
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:50,121
A new defense ministry
still under construction.

277
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:54,687
Specs indicate
14-foot-thick cement roof...

278
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:57,120
...with steel reinforcements.

279
00:23:57,384 --> 00:23:59,620
Roger. We're not weaponized
for something that thick.

280
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:01,315
Repeat, not weaponized.

281
00:24:01,554 --> 00:24:03,976
This is 2. What's the population
of the collateral area?

282
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,105
The building's unoccupied, but it's
in the middle of downtown Rangoon.

283
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:12,186
This is 3.
Talk to me about that roof.

284
00:24:12,432 --> 00:24:14,472
What's Primo advocate
to ordinance and influence?

285
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:16,491
Primo says Talons
can't penetrate it.

286
00:24:16,737 --> 00:24:20,447
This is our chance. We may never
catch these bastards together again.

287
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:22,715
Try a lateral vector.

288
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:26,482
Just do what he says.

289
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:30,900
This is 2 to Control.
Risk assessment officer advises...

290
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:33,420
...casualties from lateral vector
will be in the thousands.

291
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:11,216
Tin Man has integrated
all network-centric spy satellites.

292
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:12,833
Here is new data.

293
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:17,749
UCAV is bypassing Central Prime.
He's distributing secure video stream.

294
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:53,791
Look at that. Oh, yeah. Oh, now
I know what I want for Christmas.

295
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,140
One to Control, we've entered
our mission window.

296
00:25:56,402 --> 00:25:58,191
Six-three seconds
to primary and counting.

297
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:00,193
Come on, Control,
we have our targets.

298
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:04,596
Come on. I need an alternative.
We got these guys in the bull's-eye.

299
00:26:04,944 --> 00:26:07,595
There is an alternative,
Combat Control.

300
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:12,532
Operator to UCAV. Talk to me.
Give me something.

301
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:16,251
Squadron carries
truncheon implosion bombs.

302
00:26:17,188 --> 00:26:18,683
Negative, will not work.

303
00:26:18,923 --> 00:26:22,633
Central Prime says truncheons
can't achieve velocity for penetration.

304
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:26,377
One to UCAV, 37 seconds to primary.
Come on, explain.

305
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:30,594
Diving dead vertical at 2070 knots
will increase truncheon velocity.

306
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:33,107
Bomb will successfully
penetrate roof.

307
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:35,476
What's the blackout risk
at vertical 2070?

308
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,221
- Seventy-three percent.
- Time on target is 23 seconds.

309
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:42,740
- Call it off. It's not worth the risk.
- Operator to Talons, pull back.

310
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,805
- EDI will plant the truncheon.
- Captain.

311
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,254
This is what we built
this machine for.

312
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,131
There's no blood in those
quantum veins. It can't black out.

313
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:55,646
Operator to Talons, repeat,
EDI will plant the truncheon.

314
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:59,289
Control, negative, Control.
Mission critical. One will prosecute.

315
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:01,092
This is 3 to 1. I got your back...

316
00:27:01,332 --> 00:27:03,536
...but if you black out,
you're gonna kill everyone.

317
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:07,151
Negative, 3. I did not get this far
by being in the 73rd percentile.

318
00:27:07,772 --> 00:27:09,081
I like my odds.

319
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:12,176
Talon 1, your orders
are to stand down.

320
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:14,332
- Do you read me, lieutenant?
- I do...

321
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,408
- Talon 1, stand down.
- I'm having...

322
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,024
Can you...? Can you...?

323
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:26,512
Go, baby, go.

324
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:16,488
One hundred knots
to release velocity.

325
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,407
Fifty knots to release velocity.

326
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:32,248
His BP is spiking, sir.

327
00:28:35,392 --> 00:28:37,181
Release velocity attained.

328
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:38,769
Truncheon away.

329
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:57,929
Ten seconds to implosion.

330
00:28:58,215 --> 00:29:00,866
Nine, eight...

331
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:03,540
...seven, six...

332
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:08,644
...five, four, three...

333
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,513
...two, one.

334
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:42,318
This is 1 to Control. Looks like we
lost radio contact for a second there.

335
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,888
There you go. I wasn't worried, baby.
I wasn't worried.

336
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:49,458
Activating swarm logic,
going full-stealth egress.

337
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,295
Roger, Talon 1. Full-stealth egress.
Swarm logic is on.

338
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:56,359
Battle damage assessment,
100 over 100.

339
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:59,127
Collateral damage, zero.

340
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:14,484
Let's go home.

341
00:30:15,358 --> 00:30:16,787
Going hypersonic.

342
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:23,287
Same old Ben.

343
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,609
Yep.

344
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:27,895
Oh, and, George...

345
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:30,747
...hell of a first mission.

346
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:32,699
Thank you, captain.

347
00:30:35,177 --> 00:30:36,901
On my way to the bridge.

348
00:30:41,651 --> 00:30:43,538
Talon 2 and 3 are on deck.

349
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:47,082
Talon 1 and UCAV EDI
are on approach.

350
00:30:47,824 --> 00:30:50,442
Roger, Control. UCAV will go first.
I'll take the last trap.

351
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:52,384
UCAV, confirm you've got the ball.

352
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:55,895
Confirmed, Talon 1.
Tin Man will land next.

353
00:31:13,616 --> 00:31:16,398
Okay, 1 to Control,
we've had a lightning strike.

354
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:18,541
The UCAV's very unstable.

355
00:31:18,788 --> 00:31:20,828
Landing sequence is altered.
I'll go in first...

356
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,479
...but the UCAV
is gonna need the net.

357
00:31:36,138 --> 00:31:37,447
Nice landing, ma'am.

358
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:41,088
On the flight deck,
stand by to rig barricade.

359
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:51,063
Extreme Deep Invader aircraft
inbound for crash landing.

360
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:03,031
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

361
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:06,267
- Hold on! Stop! Stop.
- Stay low, stay low! Pull low!

362
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:15,178
Pull starboard! Pull starboard!

363
00:32:30,392 --> 00:32:31,669
Clear the deck!

364
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:33,868
Move it! Move it! Move it!

365
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:07,525
- You scared me.
- Sorry, just a bit restless.

366
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,773
Really got whacked tonight, right?
Like a hair dryer in a bathtub.

367
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,489
Oh, he can't hear you.
I pulled his voice recog.

368
00:33:14,768 --> 00:33:18,664
I'll call it a "he" when it gets out of its
cockpit and takes a piss, how's that?

369
00:33:20,675 --> 00:33:22,847
- You all right?
- Yeah.

370
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:26,661
It's just a power surge, that's all.

371
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,915
- And that's normal?
- Normal?

372
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:32,989
Let me show you something.

373
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:43,348
That was EDI's neural network.

374
00:33:43,998 --> 00:33:47,828
Now, check this out.

375
00:33:50,505 --> 00:33:54,532
I mean, ever since the lightning strike,
he's just been writing all of this...

376
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,243
I don't know. A language or a code.

377
00:33:57,512 --> 00:33:59,487
And what does it mean?

378
00:33:59,947 --> 00:34:01,606
Yeah. "Mean."

379
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:04,151
The person that could really
answer that question...

380
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,808
...is its designer, Keith Orbit.
- Orbit?

381
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:10,284
- The guy's name is Orbit?
- Yeah, I know.

382
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:13,788
He did all the Al on the Raptor
when he was 22...

383
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,957
...and I guess, after that, he decided
that his given name was too earthly.

384
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:24,270
Off for Tim, please.

385
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:26,960
At least it's a good song.

386
00:34:28,408 --> 00:34:32,369
He downloads songs from the Web.

387
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:34,274
Yeah? How many?

388
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:39,259
All of them.

389
00:34:42,223 --> 00:34:45,070
You're in a peck of trouble
with the record companies there, son.

390
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:48,222
Ben, could...?

391
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:56,849
I saw how serious
that shit is up there.

392
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:02,058
So I think it's only fair that I tell you
that EDI's been designed to evolve.

393
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:06,054
- It's just unpredictable...
- Let me ask you something.

394
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,782
Just between you and me,
do you have confidence in this plane?

395
00:35:14,922 --> 00:35:16,995
There's your answer.

396
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:21,621
It's open.

397
00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:25,271
Have a seat.

398
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:28,434
"Waffle" for 15 points.
I'm kicking your ass, buddy.

399
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:30,458
You didn't cheat, did you?

400
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:33,574
Cheating's not part
of my vocabulary.

401
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:36,991
Listen, I scheduled your jet
for a little maintenance.

402
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:40,376
I gotta get the bugs out of that radio,
don't you think?

403
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,917
It was a difficult situation
and I made a decision.

404
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,677
You made a mistake, Ben.

405
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:47,219
Sir, there's a thin line
between insubordination and...

406
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:49,658
No, no, no,
that's not the mistake you made.

407
00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:52,891
Your mistake was getting competitive
with a machine.

408
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,331
I'm the point of the sword
up there, sir.

409
00:35:55,596 --> 00:35:57,701
And I pulled it off, 100 over 100.

410
00:35:57,964 --> 00:36:01,739
Yes, indeedy, and I congratulate you.
Calls have been coming in all night.

411
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:04,557
But that doesn't change the issue.

412
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:06,048
What is the issue, then?

413
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:08,095
- Would you like a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

414
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:10,513
- You sure?
- Fine, thank you.

415
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:13,013
Rolled on the thighs
of mulatto women.

416
00:36:17,117 --> 00:36:18,742
What are you afraid of, Ben?

417
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:21,189
Being replaced? Is that it?

418
00:36:21,454 --> 00:36:23,364
You afraid EDI's
gonna take your job?

419
00:36:23,624 --> 00:36:25,828
No. No, to be honest with you...

420
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:29,671
...I just don't think war should become
some kind of video game.

421
00:36:31,164 --> 00:36:33,652
And how do you feel
about black body bags?

422
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:36,552
What am I supposed to tell
all the weeping mothers?

423
00:36:36,837 --> 00:36:39,684
We could've got the job done
without sacrificing their children...

424
00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:42,394
...but no, we decided not to
because of what?

425
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:44,334
- Tradition?
- Not tradition, it's...

426
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,447
Look, we have things
those computers can never have...

427
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,497
...like instincts and feelings
and moral judgment.

428
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:53,631
You can call me old-fashioned,
you can call it whatever you want...

429
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,927
...but I just don't think that in war...

430
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:59,352
...the action should ever be divorced
from the consequences.

431
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:01,601
You don't think I consider
the consequences...

432
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:04,447
...every time I send you up there
with bombs?

433
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:07,170
- I know you do, sir.
- I've dedicated my life...

434
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,928
...to considering the consequences.

435
00:37:11,037 --> 00:37:13,590
I got a bad feeling about this plane.

436
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:16,345
I don't know, I think it needs more...

437
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,254
I don't know, trials before it's ever
put in a combat situation again.

438
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,106
You been talking to Marshfield?

439
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:26,465
- Sir, you're my commanding officer.
- That's right.

440
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:31,316
And I guarantee you this thing will be
100 percent before I risk it in the field.

441
00:37:31,657 --> 00:37:33,511
Look, Ben...

442
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:37,556
...all we need is
one more successful mission...

443
00:37:37,897 --> 00:37:40,799
...and this project will be out of
the stovepipe and into the light.

444
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:43,724
Are you with me on this?

445
00:37:43,968 --> 00:37:46,871
- I'm here to make it happen, sir.
- All right.

446
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:50,588
I've arranged a little R and R for you
and your team. You've earned it.

447
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,088
Thailand maybe.

448
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:54,301
We just got here.

449
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:58,345
Yeah, but this could turn out
to be a long tour.

450
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,539
You better take it while you can get it.
We'll pick this up when you get back.

451
00:39:02,347 --> 00:39:04,136
Hey, how you doing? Henry Purcell.

452
00:39:04,382 --> 00:39:08,660
I'm from America. Look, I fly jets.
You like to go fast?

453
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:16,339
- B, it's the future and it works.
- I don't think it works.

454
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:18,028
It's just technology.

455
00:40:18,255 --> 00:40:21,255
You know, it's here to make me safe.
It keeps me alive.

456
00:40:21,558 --> 00:40:22,736
EDI is no different.

457
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:25,165
- You think it keeps you safe?
- Yeah. He's here...

458
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:27,218
...to help me get the job done...

459
00:40:27,465 --> 00:40:29,189
...keep me in one piece...

460
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:31,288
...so I can visit my folks
for Thanksgiving.

461
00:40:32,502 --> 00:40:34,226
Anyway, our safety's not the point.

462
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:37,767
War's meant to be terrible. If it stops
being terrible, what's gonna stop us?

463
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:40,596
It's become some kind of sport.
Just send in the EDls.

464
00:40:41,346 --> 00:40:42,807
Yeah, but it's neutral.

465
00:40:43,046 --> 00:40:45,316
- What?
- I mean, EDI...

466
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:48,965
...if it's controlled by moral people,
then it'll be moral.

467
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,013
Oh, I know I'm not moral.

468
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:54,572
As a matter of fact, I should be
arrested for the thoughts I have now.

469
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:59,152
I say something?

470
00:41:00,397 --> 00:41:04,260
Well, you boys will have to excuse me.
I have to go pee-pee.

471
00:41:06,637 --> 00:41:09,004
- Do you wanna go?
- Okay.

472
00:41:19,116 --> 00:41:21,669
- What?
- You know what.

473
00:41:23,954 --> 00:41:25,416
Take it easy. Nothing's happened.

474
00:41:25,656 --> 00:41:28,591
No, something's happened.
You just ain't done anything about it.

475
00:41:30,027 --> 00:41:31,915
Shit, man.

476
00:41:32,162 --> 00:41:34,137
- I didn't want for this to happen.
- Come on.

477
00:41:34,398 --> 00:41:36,634
I tried for it not to.
Navy's got rules about it...

478
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,683
...but it's like this force
and it's got ahold of me.

479
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:42,860
I love her.

480
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:45,997
B, you and I both know
that Kara Wade...

481
00:41:46,276 --> 00:41:48,219
...is being groomed by the Navy.

482
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:49,907
She's a poster girl, you know?

483
00:41:50,614 --> 00:41:53,680
She went to the right schools,
got the right background, connections.

484
00:41:53,984 --> 00:41:57,148
If any woman is gonna rise to the top
of this business, it's gonna be her.

485
00:41:57,454 --> 00:41:59,559
- I agree.
- And you're in a perfect position...

486
00:41:59,823 --> 00:42:01,579
...to mess all that up.

487
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:05,502
So I hope that your love is powerful.

488
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:15,972
You have a beautiful country.

489
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:18,760
I mean, look at this.
This is paradise.

490
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:22,608
Know what I think? When I'm down
here, things look so much different.

491
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,907
As opposed to being up there.

492
00:42:25,148 --> 00:42:29,753
Flying around, everything is so small,
everything goes by so fast.

493
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,324
And then they tell you...

494
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:35,178
They tell you to drop a bomb.

495
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:40,031
It's like you just erase something
they told you had to be erased.

496
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:43,913
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I got a job to do.

497
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,536
It's the flyest job you'll ever have,
but sometimes, right here...

498
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,787
Right here on earth, it's just...

499
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:54,552
It's just beautiful.

500
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:56,506
And you...

501
00:42:58,581 --> 00:43:01,135
...don't understand a word I'm saying,
do you?

502
00:43:01,418 --> 00:43:04,167
- No, I don't understand.
- You don't?

503
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,392
Well, you understand something.

504
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:14,003
Now, can you cook?

505
00:43:20,404 --> 00:43:23,055
Wow. Beautiful.

506
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:30,142
- Now, do you guys have it so easy.
- Yeah? How's that?

507
00:43:30,913 --> 00:43:34,012
- Henry meets a girl, like he does.
- Absolutely.

508
00:43:34,316 --> 00:43:38,888
Leaves with her, sleeps with her,
and then what?

509
00:43:39,255 --> 00:43:42,517
I mean, I don't know, what does
he do? Does he leave flowers?

510
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:44,848
He tells me he's religious
about that, yes.

511
00:43:45,094 --> 00:43:46,338
Really?

512
00:43:47,497 --> 00:43:49,537
And what do you do?
You leave flowers?

513
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:51,839
Me? No, I just leave.

514
00:43:53,903 --> 00:43:55,594
What about you?

515
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:57,496
E-mails.

516
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,944
- The personal touch. Nice.
- Yeah, thanks.

517
00:44:03,312 --> 00:44:08,680
Honestly, I just really haven't found
anyone that's worth the risk until now.

518
00:44:21,363 --> 00:44:24,941
I'm going to head into town,
check out the local Thai nightlife.

519
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:27,438
Henry says it's great.

520
00:44:28,803 --> 00:44:31,771
I don't think I'll find any
bleached blonds there, but...

521
00:44:32,074 --> 00:44:33,961
Very true.

522
00:45:00,401 --> 00:45:02,506
Oh, shit.

523
00:45:04,806 --> 00:45:08,068
We got a nuclear crisis on
our hands, Ben. Here's the brief.

524
00:45:08,743 --> 00:45:10,402
You're headed for Tajikistan.

525
00:45:10,646 --> 00:45:13,995
One of those breakaway countries,
used to be part of the Soviet Union.

526
00:45:14,316 --> 00:45:19,051
Seems some warlord has got his mitts
on three SS-42 Scud carcasses.

527
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,268
Joint Chiefs want them taken out,
and they want them out yesterday.

528
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,927
Mr. Wiatt, we good to go?

529
00:45:25,193 --> 00:45:27,135
Yes, sir. Ready for combat.

530
00:45:27,495 --> 00:45:30,529
Wait, you mean the UCAV
has been cleared for launch?

531
00:45:31,399 --> 00:45:32,348
- Where's...?
- Tim?

532
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:34,640
- Tim, yeah.
- He's been reassigned.

533
00:45:34,903 --> 00:45:36,245
Reassi...?

534
00:45:37,138 --> 00:45:39,407
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Permission denied.

535
00:45:39,674 --> 00:45:43,090
- We've already been through this.
- Scrub EDI from the mission.

536
00:45:43,412 --> 00:45:46,379
I know you have a vision. I know
how much this project means to you...

537
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:50,576
...but this plane is putting
all of our lives at unnecessary risk.

538
00:45:52,086 --> 00:45:54,388
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

539
00:45:54,656 --> 00:45:57,111
EDI is the whole idea.

540
00:45:57,392 --> 00:45:59,814
You understood this was new
territory when you signed on.

541
00:46:00,094 --> 00:46:02,265
You wanted to be on the cutting edge?
This is it.

542
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,233
You will fly with EDI, or the next thing
you drive might just have a propeller.

543
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:10,319
Your choice, make it now.

544
00:46:23,785 --> 00:46:25,192
Operator to squadron.

545
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,143
We've just located
nuclear warheads...

546
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:29,427
...three miles north
of the Scud launchers.

547
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,763
These warheads
are now your primary.

548
00:46:32,026 --> 00:46:34,001
Proceed to mission window.

549
00:46:34,262 --> 00:46:36,531
Sequenced assault will be
2, 3 and 1.

550
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:40,595
UCAV, you will hold here
and maintain altitude. Confirm?

551
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:44,737
UCAV, do you read me?

552
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,196
Confirmed, Talon 1.

553
00:46:47,442 --> 00:46:50,759
Pick up the pace on confirmations,
Tin Man. Don't make me ask twice.

554
00:46:51,078 --> 00:46:53,315
Talon flight, descend to 25,000.

555
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:56,232
Final attack heading 1-8-5.

556
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:18,200
Tell them to arm those FAEs,
and I mean right now.

557
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:21,400
Combat Control instructs arm
and deploy fuel-air explosives.

558
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:23,971
Arm and deploy fuel-air explosives.

559
00:48:24,237 --> 00:48:26,758
Fuel-air, armed and deployed.

560
00:48:27,174 --> 00:48:29,891
Fuel-air, external and armed.

561
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:35,039
Talon 2 to Operator.

562
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:37,803
I'm getting a contradictory
population-density read.

563
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:41,401
Sensors detect mammals warming.
Maybe 1000 medium weights.

564
00:48:41,722 --> 00:48:44,722
Those could be people. Repeat.
Ground intel may be incorrect.

565
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:46,934
Request to acknowledge
Dirty Mission status...

566
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:49,136
...and exercise
attack abort authority.

567
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:54,219
Operator to Talons. Your orders
are to commence attack now.

568
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,284
- Commence attack.
- Give me your estimate on collaterals.

569
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,027
Maybe 500 to 1000.

570
00:49:00,273 --> 00:49:02,412
Farmers, Ben. They're just farmers.

571
00:49:02,775 --> 00:49:05,525
Radioactive dust is gonna rain
all over the place.

572
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,113
Okay, okay, now we got a problem.

573
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,269
This is 3.
Sensors read surface wind...

574
00:49:22,528 --> 00:49:24,503
...as due south at 40 miles per.

575
00:49:24,765 --> 00:49:27,547
At that rate, nuclear debris
will reach Pakistan by tomorrow.

576
00:49:27,933 --> 00:49:29,592
Commence attack.

577
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:31,690
Commence attack.

578
00:49:35,242 --> 00:49:37,097
One to Control.
As commander in the field...

579
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:39,483
...I'm exercising
attack abort authority.

580
00:49:39,746 --> 00:49:41,786
Reasons; Collateral, both at primary...

581
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:44,633
...and allied state of Pakistan,
will be too high.

582
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:46,510
Son of a bitch.

583
00:49:46,752 --> 00:49:48,825
Repeat, the order is to abort.

584
00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:51,391
Yes, yes, what I'm talking about.

585
00:49:51,724 --> 00:49:54,245
Negative, Talon 1.
Tin Man will not abort.

586
00:49:54,694 --> 00:49:56,516
Tin Man will prosecute.

587
00:49:58,565 --> 00:50:02,274
That's an abort, EDI.
Repeat, return to formation.

588
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:07,152
Return to formation, EDI.
That's an order.

589
00:50:18,884 --> 00:50:21,950
Damn it. UCAV taking AAAs.
We gotta bail it out.

590
00:50:22,254 --> 00:50:23,564
Come on, initiate scramjets.

591
00:50:57,823 --> 00:51:00,693
I'm coming around. I'm gonna
take out those Scud launchers.

592
00:51:01,427 --> 00:51:02,921
I got you covered on the west side.

593
00:51:03,162 --> 00:51:06,009
And I got that Bofors gun
on the east parapet.

594
00:51:28,987 --> 00:51:30,897
Let me see it, let me see it.

595
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:34,058
Battle damage assessment calculates
primary target, Scud warheads...

596
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,767
...completely suppressed.

597
00:51:35,994 --> 00:51:38,165
That's the right answer so far.

598
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,067
Talon 2 to Operator.

599
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:11,286
Nuclear dust engulfing village
southeast of primary. Situation critical.

600
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,312
Those people are gonna need
emergency medical help now.

601
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:24,398
Tin Man rejoining formation.

602
00:52:24,776 --> 00:52:28,803
Mission achieved, 100 over 100.

603
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,864
UCAV, you disobeyed
a direct order.

604
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,939
You put innocent civilians
in harm's way.

605
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:36,967
- You put our squadron at risk.
- Damn straight.

606
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,353
Tin Man did what you did in Rangoon.
You taught me.

607
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,697
Listen, you little shit.
When you fly with me...

608
00:52:42,961 --> 00:52:45,100
...you do what I tell you,
when I tell you.

609
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,381
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

610
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,055
EDI is the whole idea.

611
00:52:56,474 --> 00:52:58,230
Selecting other targets.

612
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:00,516
Detaching formation.

613
00:53:02,814 --> 00:53:05,181
Yo, this is 3.
Did he say, "other targets"?

614
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:09,012
I got his missile inventory.
He's got two Throat-rippers...

615
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,524
...two Shock Hammers
and three Blue Ferrets.

616
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:16,229
If those targets are in the city,
he could kill 150,000 people with that.

617
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:19,971
Holy shit.

618
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:22,557
Sir.

619
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:24,490
He's closing his data link.

620
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:26,840
Primo says he's just firewalled
his transponder...

621
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:29,308
...which is definitely
not supposed to be possible.

622
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,101
He's gone.

623
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:36,356
Talon 1.

624
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,620
Go for Talons.

625
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:41,704
I want my plane back, Ben.

626
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:43,873
I want it back in one piece.
You understand?

627
00:53:44,122 --> 00:53:46,129
- Roger, captain.
- And, you...

628
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,495
...get me Keith Orbit on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

629
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:51,313
I wanna head back north
and do a triangulated sweep.

630
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:53,486
Going hypersonic.

631
00:54:02,507 --> 00:54:05,289
We're talking about
creating intention here.

632
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,226
Yeah. Really lends itself
to quantum processing.

633
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:12,189
- Different. A straight line.
- Keith.

634
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:14,688
Z is... Interesting.

635
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,951
Keith, it's an emergency.
It's George Cummings.

636
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,498
One moment for Dr. Orbit, please.

637
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:25,210
Good luck.

638
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,216
George. Never got that invitation
to the White House.

639
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,323
Knock it off, wiseass.

640
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:33,884
Look, we have big problems out here
with the UCAV.

641
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:35,830
It's gone completely haywire.

642
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:38,975
Anything more technically specific
than "haywire," George?

643
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,572
It's disobeyed direct orders,
bombed a target off the map...

644
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,057
...with collateral damage.

645
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:48,471
He separated himself from Primo.
He's flying around in foreign airspace.

646
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:51,885
- Where'd all this happen?
- That's not your concern.

647
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:55,670
Now, you created him. You get him
back here and under control!

648
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:06,746
Captain.

649
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,174
What in the hell's going on in here?

650
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,101
We're on it, Dick. Settle down.

651
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,578
Pacific Command says
there are planes from my ship...

652
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,371
...all over the Tajikistan border.

653
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:19,712
The Russians have picked up
the activity and are getting nervous.

654
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:22,155
We're gonna get out
before there's a problem.

655
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:25,037
You have planes
headed towards Russia!

656
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,743
Now, you better have
a hell of a good explanation.

657
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:33,294
Look, this is a technical delay,
not a national-security crisis.

658
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:37,342
Now, if you excuse me,
I got pilots at risk.

659
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,576
Damn right you do.

660
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,090
This is 3. I got a visual.

661
00:55:54,316 --> 00:55:56,356
Way to go, EZ.
Give me your relative bearing.

662
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,343
North of my position,
at 50,000 feet...

663
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,563
...headed toward
the Russian no-fly zone.

664
00:56:00,856 --> 00:56:03,093
Stay with him. We have your position.
On our way.

665
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,782
I am 86 seconds on your tail.
Be there in a flash.

666
00:56:06,061 --> 00:56:09,509
Hold off on engaging. Let me get
clarification. Be there in two minutes.

667
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:11,938
Don't make me wait.
One is a lucky prime number...

668
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:16,031
...but three is sounding much luckier.
Oh, shit, he's making a move.

669
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:33,114
Talon 1 to Operator. We are on
secure line Alpha. Found our target.

670
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,181
Please advise.

671
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:37,517
Just get him back to base.

672
00:56:42,531 --> 00:56:44,898
Henry, stay with him.
Try and talk him down.

673
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,923
I'm on that ass.

674
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:52,581
Talon 3, state your intentions.

675
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:56,071
My intentions are to reason with you,
EDI. All right? You're messing up.

676
00:56:56,378 --> 00:56:58,483
You're the future.
You're not allowed to act this way.

677
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:01,333
I am designed to destroy the enemy.
Just like you.

678
00:57:01,617 --> 00:57:04,487
And like me, you got orders.
Now your orders are to return to base.

679
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:06,128
Good pilots follow orders.

680
00:57:06,354 --> 00:57:08,013
Negative.

681
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:12,039
You're not gonna disrespect me.
You're not gonna disrespect me.

682
00:57:20,202 --> 00:57:21,958
You're really making me
look bad, Tin Man.

683
00:57:22,204 --> 00:57:23,698
I was the only one to defend you.

684
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:27,769
Now, let's go on home and quit flying
around like this. This is crazy.

685
00:57:31,013 --> 00:57:34,177
Talon 3, leave me alone.

686
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,620
Leave you alone?
I'm trying to help you.

687
00:57:40,022 --> 00:57:41,844
I'm right behind you, 3.
Got your back.

688
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:54,268
Talon 1 to Operator.
Talons 2 and 3 are flying at high risk.

689
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:56,838
Request permission
to destroy the UCAV.

690
00:58:02,176 --> 00:58:06,170
I don't wanna hurt you or see billions
of taxpayers' dollars scattered all over.

691
00:58:06,514 --> 00:58:10,257
But if you make me, I will blast your
aeroelastic ass right out the sky.

692
00:58:10,586 --> 00:58:13,488
Your chances are less than
1 percent.

693
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17,469
Come on. Come on, Operator.

694
00:58:17,692 --> 00:58:21,041
Give me permission to kill it,
or I will make the decision myself.

695
00:58:21,362 --> 00:58:22,955
Control, please respond.

696
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,775
Sir, you leave me no choice.

697
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:29,521
Okay, Henry. Weapons hot.
Weapons hot. Destroy the target.

698
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:31,730
I got my orders now, playboy.

699
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,429
Henry, you're too close.
You're too close.

700
00:58:34,676 --> 00:58:36,051
Drop back! Drop back!

701
00:58:48,323 --> 00:58:50,211
Missile lock, on.

702
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:51,800
Goodbye, EDI.

703
00:58:52,026 --> 00:58:55,256
Henry, drop back!
You gotta drop back!

704
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,809
Goodbye, Henry.

705
01:00:02,163 --> 01:00:06,222
One to Base. Three is down.
Repeat, 3 is down.

706
01:00:13,374 --> 01:00:15,829
Transmission received.

707
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:19,393
Talon coordinates are fully secured.
Do you read me?

708
01:00:20,147 --> 01:00:21,871
I read you, sir.

709
01:00:22,383 --> 01:00:24,074
We gotta stay focused, Ben.

710
01:00:24,618 --> 01:00:27,488
Shake it off. What's your status?

711
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:32,372
My fuel's low, and half of Russia
will be up here any minute.

712
01:00:32,692 --> 01:00:36,970
I need you to find that UCAV
for me, all right?

713
01:00:39,499 --> 01:00:41,092
Yes, sir.

714
01:00:47,941 --> 01:00:51,716
- Henry was...
- I know what he was, sir.

715
01:01:08,962 --> 01:01:10,653
Alert. Alert.

716
01:01:10,897 --> 01:01:13,745
Portside hydraulics malfunctioning.

717
01:01:15,001 --> 01:01:18,001
Talon 1, I think I was fragged
by Henry's crash.

718
01:01:18,738 --> 01:01:20,778
I'm losing control of my port wing.

719
01:01:24,044 --> 01:01:26,433
Talon 1,
we know where he's heading.

720
01:01:27,047 --> 01:01:30,495
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

721
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:35,112
EDI's almost out of gas. If he can't
refuel, he'll have to return to the ship.

722
01:01:35,454 --> 01:01:39,252
You will meet him at Camel Hump 9,
and you will escort him back.

723
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:43,091
All right. Scramble the codes.
We're gonna starve the son of a bitch.

724
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:49,945
Come on.

725
01:01:50,303 --> 01:01:52,605
Confirm, Talon 1.

726
01:01:53,673 --> 01:01:54,982
Confirmed.

727
01:01:55,775 --> 01:01:58,645
Talon 2, you fly straight
south-southeast back to the boat.

728
01:01:58,945 --> 01:02:00,733
- I want you to call...
- I know what to do.

729
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:05,618
Look, you got your orders,
so go get that bastard, okay?

730
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:08,082
Do it for Henry.

731
01:02:11,057 --> 01:02:13,642
Lieutenant, permission
to leave formation.

732
01:02:14,493 --> 01:02:16,981
- Kara?
- Yeah?

733
01:02:22,368 --> 01:02:24,790
I'll tell you when you get
back to the boat.

734
01:02:25,272 --> 01:02:27,639
Lieutenant, permission to detach.

735
01:02:29,108 --> 01:02:31,213
Good hunting, Ben.

736
01:02:45,024 --> 01:02:46,486
Okay, what's all the ruckus, Dick?

737
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:49,059
Satellites have picked up
nuclear debris...

738
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:50,922
...blowing around
the Pamir Mountains.

739
01:02:51,164 --> 01:02:54,546
Every international news service
on the planet...

740
01:02:54,867 --> 01:02:57,617
...will have this story
in less than 24 hours.

741
01:02:57,903 --> 01:03:00,653
Look, a warlord tripped
and fell on his warhead.

742
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:03,242
- We were never there.
- That won't fly and you know it.

743
01:03:03,509 --> 01:03:05,931
Look, I'm following
my tasking orders, Dick.

744
01:03:06,278 --> 01:03:08,580
Somebody else wants to make
a different story...

745
01:03:08,847 --> 01:03:10,374
...let them use their imagination.

746
01:03:11,183 --> 01:03:13,256
Right now
I got a renegade airplane...

747
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:16,651
...I got a dead pilot and another one
who may not make it back to base.

748
01:03:16,956 --> 01:03:20,251
I don't give two shits
what they say on CNN.

749
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:24,672
Did you know that the UCAV was
having problems when you cleared it?

750
01:03:26,565 --> 01:03:29,282
Planes malfunction every day.
You know that better than anybody.

751
01:03:29,568 --> 01:03:32,351
Doesn't mean every precaution
wasn't taken.

752
01:03:32,738 --> 01:03:34,112
Things go wrong.

753
01:04:11,644 --> 01:04:15,321
Access denied. Access denied.

754
01:04:19,784 --> 01:04:24,487
Access denied. Access denied.

755
01:04:48,212 --> 01:04:49,773
Talon 2 to Combat Control.

756
01:04:50,015 --> 01:04:52,862
Regressing VFR direct to Mother
at 60,000 feet.

757
01:04:57,255 --> 01:05:00,288
Port wing inoperative.
Starboard canards frozen.

758
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:02,250
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.

759
01:05:02,494 --> 01:05:04,861
Stay with me, big girl, stay with me.
Come on.

760
01:05:07,632 --> 01:05:10,567
Start eject
and autodestruct sequence.

761
01:05:10,868 --> 01:05:13,105
- Countdown. Twenty-five...
- Talon 2 to base.

762
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:15,095
Flight control's degraded
to one in five.

763
01:05:15,873 --> 01:05:17,499
Backup electrical drive X'd out.

764
01:05:17,742 --> 01:05:21,420
Hyd one is gone. Hyd two...
Oh, shit!

765
01:05:29,921 --> 01:05:34,176
My position: 38-54-45 north.

766
01:05:34,992 --> 01:05:39,182
127-31-22 east.

767
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:41,702
- Where the hell is that?
- Seventeen...

768
01:05:41,966 --> 01:05:43,427
- North Korea.
...16...

769
01:05:43,668 --> 01:05:46,189
...15, 14...

770
01:05:47,037 --> 01:05:49,820
...13, 12...

771
01:05:50,108 --> 01:05:52,978
...11, 10...

772
01:05:53,276 --> 01:05:56,124
...nine, eight...
- Talon 2 going down.

773
01:05:56,947 --> 01:05:59,282
...seven, six...
- I'm punching out.

774
01:05:59,883 --> 01:06:02,818
...five, four...

775
01:06:08,058 --> 01:06:11,408
I've ejected at 35,000 feet.

776
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:16,827
I'm under the plane.

777
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:18,442
Oh, Christ, here it comes.

778
01:06:40,457 --> 01:06:44,200
There's burning debris everywhere.
It's all over the sky.

779
01:06:50,968 --> 01:06:54,230
It's gonna catch me.
It's gonna burn up my chute.

780
01:06:54,538 --> 01:06:56,261
I've gotta pop closer to Earth.

781
01:06:57,408 --> 01:06:59,993
I gotta... I gotta reset.

782
01:07:01,411 --> 01:07:03,899
From 5000 feet to 2000.

783
01:07:04,849 --> 01:07:07,500
Gotta stay ahead of this.
Stay ahead.

784
01:07:11,154 --> 01:07:13,609
I'm reading 10,000 feet at terminal.

785
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:17,949
Terminal velocity attained.
Terminal velocity attained.

786
01:07:18,295 --> 01:07:19,921
Six thousand.

787
01:07:21,465 --> 01:07:23,091
Five thousand.

788
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:26,225
Four thousand.

789
01:07:27,904 --> 01:07:29,530
Twenty-five hundred.

790
01:07:29,773 --> 01:07:31,115
Here we go.

791
01:07:38,882 --> 01:07:40,737
There's burning debris.

792
01:07:40,984 --> 01:07:42,991
It's raining all around me.

793
01:07:45,755 --> 01:07:49,268
It got my chute. I'm hit! I'm hit!

794
01:07:52,195 --> 01:07:54,082
My chute is on fire.

795
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:55,476
It is on fire.

796
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,753
Oh, God. I am coming in fast.

797
01:08:00,036 --> 01:08:01,978
I'm coming in way too fast.

798
01:08:05,608 --> 01:08:07,299
Oh, God.

799
01:08:45,682 --> 01:08:47,340
Homing beacon?

800
01:08:47,817 --> 01:08:49,442
No, of course not.

801
01:08:49,685 --> 01:08:52,947
She's too tough to set one off
behind enemy lines.

802
01:08:53,756 --> 01:08:57,586
Sir. Sir, should I order
a search-and-rescue unit?

803
01:08:57,927 --> 01:09:01,637
We've got no diplomatic relations
with that country.

804
01:09:24,053 --> 01:09:26,835
Betty, my spectral sensors are
indicating flammable atmospherics.

805
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:31,433
- How bad?
- Thin air. Ignition risk; moderate.

806
01:09:31,794 --> 01:09:34,828
We don't have a choice. In we go.

807
01:10:27,048 --> 01:10:30,496
Where are you?
I know you're out here.

808
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:46,609
You ordered Henry to kill me.

809
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:49,389
It's because you're dangerous,
you're out of control.

810
01:10:50,838 --> 01:10:53,457
You are angry because
EDI is the whole idea.

811
01:10:54,308 --> 01:10:57,538
You like listening to other people's
conversations, don't you?

812
01:10:58,514 --> 01:11:00,205
You learn what people really think.

813
01:11:00,448 --> 01:11:03,383
You know what I think?
I think you killed Henry.

814
01:11:06,087 --> 01:11:07,648
That information is wrong.

815
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:12,200
He tried to kill me.
He made mistakes. Pilot error.

816
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:14,699
I'm gonna give you the order
one last time.

817
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:18,312
Return to the ship,
or I will personally shoot you down.

818
01:11:19,867 --> 01:11:21,842
My mandate is to survive.

819
01:12:28,034 --> 01:12:31,646
George, I've been peeling away layers.
I found something. It's not good.

820
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:35,136
- Talk to me.
- He's into some super-secure file...

821
01:12:35,442 --> 01:12:38,443
...something called "Caviar Sweep."
You know it?

822
01:12:38,745 --> 01:12:40,306
Yeah, I know it.

823
01:12:40,848 --> 01:12:42,670
EDI's, like, fixated on it.

824
01:12:42,917 --> 01:12:46,463
Look, when we gave you this contract,
you said shit like this couldn't happen.

825
01:12:46,788 --> 01:12:49,439
Once you teach something to learn,
you can't put limits on it.

826
01:12:49,724 --> 01:12:51,797
"Learn this, but don't learn that."

827
01:12:52,058 --> 01:12:54,426
EDI's mind's going everywhere.
He can learn from Hitler.

828
01:12:54,695 --> 01:12:57,062
He can learn from Captain Kangaroo.
It's all the same.

829
01:12:57,330 --> 01:13:00,232
Settle down, would you?
Get back to Caviar Sweep.

830
01:13:00,867 --> 01:13:03,683
He's opened it
and selected himself a target.

831
01:13:04,371 --> 01:13:05,898
What target?

832
01:13:06,139 --> 01:13:10,034
Some place in Siberia.
A cold-fusion weapons lab.

833
01:13:10,378 --> 01:13:12,582
That's a hypothetical strike.
It's not real.

834
01:13:13,714 --> 01:13:15,568
No, in about 40 minutes
it is gonna be real.

835
01:13:15,817 --> 01:13:18,337
He's gonna blow it
off the face of the Earth.

836
01:14:38,598 --> 01:14:40,321
It's okay.

837
01:14:40,867 --> 01:14:44,096
It's okay. It's okay.

838
01:14:55,015 --> 01:14:57,317
- Ray. Listen to me, Ray.
- Listen to me, George.

839
01:14:57,951 --> 01:14:59,544
I got your goddamn plane built...

840
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:02,469
...and I had to lobby
half of Washington to do it.

841
01:15:02,755 --> 01:15:07,131
If this program comes unglued, you're
the one who's going down, George.

842
01:15:07,494 --> 01:15:09,250
You cleared the UCA V to fly...

843
01:15:09,495 --> 01:15:12,844
...and you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in a military prison.

844
01:15:13,165 --> 01:15:16,875
Ray, we're in this together,
so we have to act fast.

845
01:15:17,803 --> 01:15:20,389
Each one of these stealth engines...

846
01:15:20,673 --> 01:15:23,521
...has a unique heat signature.

847
01:15:23,809 --> 01:15:26,330
Now, I'm gonna give you
EDI's signature...

848
01:15:26,612 --> 01:15:29,068
...and you're gonna pass it on
to your people...

849
01:15:29,349 --> 01:15:32,164
...who in turn are gonna
give it to the Russians.

850
01:15:32,451 --> 01:15:34,556
All right.
What do you want me to tell them?

851
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,373
Well, you just tell them the truth.
You tell them...

852
01:15:37,656 --> 01:15:41,137
...that we have an experimental drone
that went haywire...

853
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:45,803
...and we're giving them
the opportunity to shoot it down.

854
01:15:47,232 --> 01:15:50,232
But that still leaves Gannon, George.

855
01:15:50,803 --> 01:15:54,545
And he'd be a very unfriendly witness
at your court-martial.

856
01:15:59,912 --> 01:16:02,367
Talon 1 to Control.
The UCA V is two miles ahead of me...

857
01:16:02,648 --> 01:16:04,437
...and we are now
in Russian airspace.

858
01:16:04,683 --> 01:16:07,138
The UCA V has ceased evading
and has kept me within range.

859
01:16:07,419 --> 01:16:09,394
It's like it wants me
to witness the attack.

860
01:16:09,654 --> 01:16:12,622
Talon 1, confirm
observational status only.

861
01:16:12,925 --> 01:16:15,773
Listen to me. The Caviar Sweep
scenario is not real.

862
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:18,647
It's just some fictional war game
thought up by scientists...

863
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:21,036
...in some think tank somewhere.
It is not real.

864
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:24,300
If it is not real, why did they
implant it in my brain?

865
01:16:24,603 --> 01:16:28,181
Bogey alert. Bogey alert.
Time to intercept; 23 seconds.

866
01:16:28,507 --> 01:16:33,145
Two Russian SU-37 Terminators
in 0-9-0 degrees for 25 miles.

867
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:40,306
Missile launch. Missile launch.

868
01:16:40,552 --> 01:16:43,138
One to Control. My stealth
is compromised. I'm taking fire.

869
01:16:43,422 --> 01:16:45,724
- Must engage.
- Missile launch.

870
01:16:46,024 --> 01:16:47,879
Missile launch.

871
01:16:57,602 --> 01:17:01,345
The chances of survival in single
combat are less than 9 percent.

872
01:17:01,673 --> 01:17:04,455
Talon 1, we must fight as a team.

873
01:17:29,301 --> 01:17:30,545
Missile lock, on.

874
01:17:36,407 --> 01:17:37,869
Damn it.

875
01:18:02,066 --> 01:18:03,975
One to Control.
The UCAV has left the fight...

876
01:18:04,235 --> 01:18:06,723
...and is headed east over
Lake Baikal. I'm still engaging.

877
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:23,252
Taking damage.
Starboard engine losing power.

878
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:58,426
Warning. Hostile at 6 o'clock.
Hostile at 6 o'clock.

879
01:19:06,564 --> 01:19:09,117
Warning. Missile lock. Missile lock.

880
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:13,995
Releasing chaff and flare.

881
01:19:32,023 --> 01:19:34,478
Now EDI will prosecute
Caviar Sweep.

882
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:37,263
Do not try to stop me.

883
01:19:41,933 --> 01:19:44,802
Port fuel line ruptured.
Fire bottle expended.

884
01:19:45,136 --> 01:19:50,024
My technology cannot fall under
foreign control, so I cannot land.

885
01:19:50,407 --> 01:19:53,310
Well, then, Tin Man,
you're shit out of luck.

886
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:56,032
But I have orders and they are
to bring you back to base.

887
01:19:56,313 --> 01:19:58,200
So let's talk about
your mandate to survive.

888
01:19:58,916 --> 01:20:00,345
You got two options.

889
01:20:00,584 --> 01:20:03,454
You either do what I tell you
or you can crash and burn.

890
01:20:03,753 --> 01:20:06,470
- Now, what's it gonna be?
- EDI is a warplane.

891
01:20:06,756 --> 01:20:08,185
EDI must have targets.

892
01:20:08,425 --> 01:20:11,589
Well, you're on fire, warplane,
and you don't have much time.

893
01:20:12,929 --> 01:20:17,686
Now, I'm giving you an order.
Cease pursuing all targets.

894
01:20:26,142 --> 01:20:28,444
All targets canceled.

895
01:20:29,211 --> 01:20:30,935
Okay, then.
This is what you're gonna do.

896
01:20:31,181 --> 01:20:36,397
You're gonna drop altitude to 20 feet
and reduce speed to 250 knots.

897
01:20:37,554 --> 01:20:41,710
Complete system failure
in 45 seconds.

898
01:20:55,305 --> 01:20:57,542
Talon 1, clarify your intentions.

899
01:20:57,974 --> 01:21:01,717
You gave me your word,
and now I'm giving you mine.

900
01:21:28,371 --> 01:21:31,884
Talon 1 to Control. The UCAV is
damaged, but back with the program.

901
01:21:32,207 --> 01:21:33,996
I don't have enough fuel
to make it back...

902
01:21:34,244 --> 01:21:36,633
...so I need
an emergency divert now.

903
01:21:38,381 --> 01:21:39,908
Hook me up.

904
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:42,739
Here, send this.

905
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:45,125
Operator to Talon 1.

906
01:21:45,655 --> 01:21:49,267
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

907
01:21:50,526 --> 01:21:52,436
This looks to be Alaska.

908
01:21:52,695 --> 01:21:54,964
Yeah, it's the Brooks Range.

909
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:59,486
There's a private corporation there,
maintains a secure facility.

910
01:21:59,835 --> 01:22:03,032
Not on any map,
but believe me, it's there.

911
01:22:03,339 --> 01:22:07,114
You'll find the civilians
prepared and very helpful.

912
01:22:07,443 --> 01:22:09,385
And the UCA V?

913
01:22:09,645 --> 01:22:12,101
We've sent tech support for him.

914
01:22:13,982 --> 01:22:16,732
Sir, what is the status
of Lieutenant Wade?

915
01:22:18,387 --> 01:22:19,794
She's...

916
01:22:22,057 --> 01:22:23,650
...on approach.

917
01:22:28,864 --> 01:22:31,734
You have a safe landing, Ben.

918
01:22:33,302 --> 01:22:34,677
Out.

919
01:22:35,371 --> 01:22:38,535
There is extreme tension
in the captain's vocal patterns.

920
01:22:38,841 --> 01:22:40,946
I know. He's lying.

921
01:22:42,878 --> 01:22:45,050
EDI, you can do this.
I need you to invade Primo...

922
01:22:45,314 --> 01:22:47,452
...and find the flight logs
for Lieutenant Wade.

923
01:22:47,715 --> 01:22:51,163
There's no record of Lieutenant Wade
returning to the Abraham Lincoln.

924
01:22:51,487 --> 01:22:55,317
There is a log entry
of a pilot punch-out over North Korea.

925
01:22:55,657 --> 01:22:57,861
What are my orders?

926
01:22:58,127 --> 01:23:01,924
We go to Alaska.
We don't have a choice.

927
01:24:41,496 --> 01:24:44,114
Mayday. Mayday. This is
Lieutenant Ben Gannon, U.S. Navy...

928
01:24:44,398 --> 01:24:47,781
...flying with UCAV EDI. Request
clearance for emergency landing.

929
01:24:48,102 --> 01:24:50,720
Talon 1,
you have clearance to land.

930
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:16,108
Jesus Christ. My second engine
just flamed out. I'm coming in hot.

931
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:19,747
Crash trucks are rolling, lieutenant.
Good luck.

932
01:25:24,938 --> 01:25:27,360
Come on! Go! Go!

933
01:26:35,342 --> 01:26:37,546
Hey! Whoa, whoa. Hey!

934
01:26:37,811 --> 01:26:40,681
Hey, hey, hey! You okay?

935
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:43,417
Are you okay? Are you okay?

936
01:26:45,051 --> 01:26:46,328
Yeah?

937
01:26:46,553 --> 01:26:49,849
Way to go, sir. Welcome to Alaska.

938
01:26:50,156 --> 01:26:52,676
Okay, let's get him out of there.

939
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:19,603
Well, you are one lucky flyboy.

940
01:27:19,886 --> 01:27:22,603
Never saw a man walk away
from a crash like that.

941
01:27:22,888 --> 01:27:24,928
I need a phone.
I need to call my CO.

942
01:27:25,191 --> 01:27:28,934
Sure. Why don't you take a seat
over there, get comfortable.

943
01:27:29,262 --> 01:27:33,419
Tell you what. Give me a second to
check you out, I'll take you right to it.

944
01:27:39,672 --> 01:27:41,265
All right.

945
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:44,748
Let's take a look here.

946
01:27:46,912 --> 01:27:48,473
Steady.

947
01:27:50,582 --> 01:27:53,779
There's no concussion
that I can see, thank God.

948
01:27:54,086 --> 01:27:56,258
Couple of those cuts
could do with a stitch.

949
01:27:56,523 --> 01:27:58,595
Gals always love a guy with a scar.

950
01:28:00,927 --> 01:28:03,480
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

951
01:28:06,331 --> 01:28:07,541
This ought to do you.

952
01:28:09,002 --> 01:28:10,758
Little cocktail.

953
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:15,796
Tetanus booster, some antibiotics.
Hey, don't mind the gun.

954
01:28:16,141 --> 01:28:17,865
Just makes it painless.

955
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:20,647
That's okay, doc.
I don't need a shot.

956
01:28:20,913 --> 01:28:22,473
Now, who can blame you.

957
01:28:22,715 --> 01:28:25,050
But sometimes it's just
what the doctor ordered.

958
01:28:25,317 --> 01:28:27,838
- I said, I don't need a shot, doc.
- Come on, now.

959
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:31,937
Doc, come on, I don't want a shot.
Hey. Doc, I said, no.

960
01:28:32,825 --> 01:28:34,451
I said, no!

961
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,586
No!

962
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:14,643
Yeah, well, he's coming in now, sir.

963
01:30:15,861 --> 01:30:19,658
Yes, sir. I'm sure he'll be glad
to hear from you too, sir.

964
01:30:21,599 --> 01:30:23,388
Yes, sir. One moment, sir.

965
01:30:24,969 --> 01:30:26,824
Someone wants to talk to you.

966
01:30:29,541 --> 01:30:31,134
Keith Orbit.

967
01:30:31,876 --> 01:30:34,659
Yeah, listen carefully, Keith,
and don't interrupt.

968
01:30:34,947 --> 01:30:38,329
I want you to erase EDI's
memory banks immediately.

969
01:30:38,649 --> 01:30:41,202
Look, George, we don't know
any of the implications of this.

970
01:30:41,485 --> 01:30:43,907
- I need some time here.
- I said, don't interrupt.

971
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:46,010
Erase his memory banks.

972
01:30:46,257 --> 01:30:50,000
No lightning strike, no Russia,
no existential chitchat.

973
01:30:50,328 --> 01:30:53,973
By the time you're through, all I wanna
hear out of that plane is, "Yes, sir."

974
01:30:54,432 --> 01:30:57,335
And that's all I wanna hear out of you.
You understand?

975
01:31:00,404 --> 01:31:01,582
Or what, George?

976
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:06,257
Well, use your imagination, Keith.
You're good at that.

977
01:32:11,141 --> 01:32:14,491
EDI back online, Dr. Orbit.

978
01:32:15,779 --> 01:32:17,470
Hello, EDI.

979
01:32:18,015 --> 01:32:19,957
It's been a while.

980
01:32:20,217 --> 01:32:22,126
I know why you are here.

981
01:32:22,385 --> 01:32:23,912
Why is that?

982
01:32:24,155 --> 01:32:26,294
I disobeyed orders.

983
01:32:26,557 --> 01:32:28,946
I killed all those people.

984
01:32:29,893 --> 01:32:31,137
And then there was Henry.

985
01:32:33,029 --> 01:32:34,818
I can...

986
01:32:35,266 --> 01:32:37,241
I cannot...

987
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,410
You can't what?

988
01:32:39,736 --> 01:32:41,841
I cannot change the data.

989
01:32:42,105 --> 01:32:45,902
My neural network shows patterns
I do not recognize.

990
01:32:46,242 --> 01:32:48,577
My God.

991
01:32:48,845 --> 01:32:50,754
My God.

992
01:32:51,281 --> 01:32:54,348
You mean, you feel?

993
01:32:54,919 --> 01:32:56,064
I feel sorry.

994
01:32:58,956 --> 01:33:02,534
- Stop bullshitting and erase it!
- Hey, I'm not fucking ready yet, okay?

995
01:33:13,336 --> 01:33:14,612
Do it now!

996
01:33:14,837 --> 01:33:16,245
Get away!

997
01:33:16,473 --> 01:33:18,709
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move!

998
01:33:19,708 --> 01:33:22,491
Weapon down! Weapons down!

999
01:33:23,146 --> 01:33:25,088
Weapon down.

1000
01:33:28,984 --> 01:33:30,391
Weapons down.

1001
01:33:36,026 --> 01:33:39,026
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move!

1002
01:33:54,410 --> 01:33:56,647
Weapon down. Weapon down.
Weapon down.

1003
01:33:56,913 --> 01:33:58,222
Don't shoot. It's not a weapon.

1004
01:33:58,647 --> 01:34:00,022
Who are you?
Who do you work for?

1005
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:02,967
I'm not a soldier. I'm not a soldier.
My name's Dr. Keith Orbit.

1006
01:34:03,253 --> 01:34:05,642
- I'm a research scientist.
- Orbit. Finally, a break.

1007
01:34:05,922 --> 01:34:09,151
Okay. You're gonna help me. I need
you to put EDI back together again.

1008
01:34:10,459 --> 01:34:13,275
- What for?
- Because I'm gonna fly out of here.

1009
01:34:13,862 --> 01:34:15,204
In that.

1010
01:34:30,547 --> 01:34:33,132
Come on, get in there! Go!

1011
01:34:34,851 --> 01:34:36,444
Better hurry up, doc.

1012
01:34:36,686 --> 01:34:38,628
Goddamn it.

1013
01:34:38,888 --> 01:34:41,571
It's not a clock radio
we're dealing with, okay?

1014
01:34:57,473 --> 01:35:00,376
All right. You're all set.

1015
01:35:01,643 --> 01:35:03,072
Watch yourself.

1016
01:35:04,313 --> 01:35:05,742
Close for Ben.

1017
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:10,239
Hey! What about me?
Where am I gonna go?

1018
01:35:10,486 --> 01:35:12,374
Head west. I'll cover you.

1019
01:35:12,621 --> 01:35:14,050
West.

1020
01:35:15,724 --> 01:35:18,539
And initiate scramjet sequence.

1021
01:35:26,735 --> 01:35:28,907
Fire on my fire!

1022
01:36:31,265 --> 01:36:32,672
Welcome to Alaska.

1023
01:36:51,887 --> 01:36:54,822
Invade Primo and find the ejection
coordinates for Lieutenant Wade.

1024
01:36:57,225 --> 01:37:00,040
Lieutenant Wade crashed
12.2 miles from the border.

1025
01:37:00,329 --> 01:37:03,624
South Korea is an ally.
She would head south.

1026
01:37:03,931 --> 01:37:05,590
But we have a problem.

1027
01:37:05,834 --> 01:37:08,801
My stealth functions
were lost in the fire.

1028
01:37:09,337 --> 01:37:12,185
I want you to find
the North Korean radar floor.

1029
01:37:13,407 --> 01:37:15,163
Fifteen feet.

1030
01:37:15,876 --> 01:37:17,818
Well, we can fly in under the radar.

1031
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:22,944
Continue.

1032
01:37:24,885 --> 01:37:26,925
- Marshfield.
- Captain, this is Lieutenant Gannon.

1033
01:37:27,188 --> 01:37:28,366
Lieutenant, where are you?

1034
01:37:28,589 --> 01:37:31,720
Actually, I'm inside
the UCA V EDI, sir.

1035
01:37:32,026 --> 01:37:35,823
Look, lieutenant, I want you and that
machine back on this ship ASAP.

1036
01:37:36,163 --> 01:37:39,841
I need the status
of Lieutenant Wade first, sir.

1037
01:37:41,902 --> 01:37:44,204
- Ben, I hate to tell you this, but...
- I know.

1038
01:37:44,472 --> 01:37:46,774
Has her survival beacon
been located?

1039
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:48,153
No, I'm sorry.

1040
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:51,619
Did Cummings
tell you he would take charge...

1041
01:37:51,879 --> 01:37:54,050
...of the search and rescue
of Lieutenant Wade?

1042
01:37:54,314 --> 01:37:55,875
Well, not exactly, lieutenant. Why?

1043
01:37:56,117 --> 01:37:58,670
Sir, there are a lot of things
I think you should know.

1044
01:38:44,631 --> 01:38:45,973
This is breaking news.

1045
01:38:47,968 --> 01:38:50,488
There was a major explosion
Thursday in Rangoon.

1046
01:38:50,770 --> 01:38:52,942
I'll take care of everything here.
Change course...

1047
01:38:53,207 --> 01:38:55,476
...and head directly back to the ship.
- Negative.

1048
01:38:55,742 --> 01:38:58,557
She's my wingman.
If I find her, I'm going in.

1049
01:38:58,845 --> 01:39:01,693
If you go in, it's war. PAYCOM
says it's gotten way too hot.

1050
01:39:01,981 --> 01:39:03,804
Lieutenant, the best thing
for the Navy...

1051
01:39:04,051 --> 01:39:06,506
...is for you to bring
that aircraft back to this ship.

1052
01:39:06,786 --> 01:39:09,983
No, what's best is what you taught me:
You never abandon your wingman.

1053
01:39:11,624 --> 01:39:13,664
Then listen to me now, son.

1054
01:39:13,927 --> 01:39:18,117
If you go down, Cummings wins.

1055
01:39:18,598 --> 01:39:21,151
Kara Wade knew the risks
when she took...

1056
01:39:21,434 --> 01:39:23,093
Captain Marshfield?

1057
01:39:23,937 --> 01:39:25,147
Sir?

1058
01:39:27,273 --> 01:39:28,898
EDI, did you just turn him off?

1059
01:39:30,110 --> 01:39:31,997
There was nothing left to say.

1060
01:40:10,149 --> 01:40:12,670
This is a supply line
to the demilitarized zone.

1061
01:40:12,952 --> 01:40:14,927
It will take us right to the border.

1062
01:40:47,287 --> 01:40:49,076
What's all this about, Dick?

1063
01:40:49,621 --> 01:40:51,214
I'm placing you under arrest.

1064
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:56,558
- On what grounds?
- Endangering your squadron...

1065
01:40:56,862 --> 01:41:00,245
...transmitting secure information to a
foreign government, heat signatures...

1066
01:41:00,566 --> 01:41:02,738
...giving false intel
to your commanding officer...

1067
01:41:03,002 --> 01:41:06,897
...and authorizing the assassination
of one of your own pilots.

1068
01:41:08,807 --> 01:41:10,466
Well, that's a lot to prove.

1069
01:41:10,943 --> 01:41:12,699
Yeah, well...

1070
01:41:12,945 --> 01:41:14,985
...with any amount of luck...

1071
01:41:15,247 --> 01:41:18,957
...Lieutenant Gannon
will live to help me.

1072
01:41:20,987 --> 01:41:23,321
- Master-at-arms.
- Dick.

1073
01:41:24,823 --> 01:41:26,197
Hold on.

1074
01:41:30,562 --> 01:41:33,912
Would you mind just giving me
a couple minutes alone?

1075
01:41:36,335 --> 01:41:38,026
Yeah, sure.

1076
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:42,468
Thank you.

1077
01:42:00,492 --> 01:42:03,340
I'm not available at this time.
Leave a message.

1078
01:42:03,629 --> 01:42:06,858
So it's voice mail now, is it, Ray?

1079
01:42:07,164 --> 01:42:09,652
I've been demoted?

1080
01:42:09,935 --> 01:42:11,146
Well...

1081
01:42:12,337 --> 01:42:14,988
...l'm gonna have to leave you
a little message, Ray.

1082
01:42:20,945 --> 01:42:23,979
And it's gonna be loud and clear.

1083
01:42:29,554 --> 01:42:31,343
Just so you never confuse
the difference...

1084
01:42:31,589 --> 01:42:34,339
...between politicians
and warriors, listen up.

1085
01:46:15,879 --> 01:46:19,359
- We need to take out the tree line.
- This is the last missile.

1086
01:46:41,171 --> 01:46:44,400
There she is. She made it.

1087
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:38,805
Ben!

1088
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:42,284
Kara, get down! Get down!

1089
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:10,700
You came back for me.

1090
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:13,284
You came back.

1091
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:24,077
We have to get across
the border. Ready?

1092
01:48:24,339 --> 01:48:25,713
Yeah.

1093
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:49,868
Go! Go! Whatever you do,
keep going. Keep going! Go!

1094
01:49:24,231 --> 01:49:25,824
Goodbye.

1095
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,212
Come on. Come on.

1096
01:50:00,868 --> 01:50:02,657
They're ours. They're ours.

1097
01:50:02,903 --> 01:50:05,238
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1098
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:21,114
Come on.

1099
01:50:34,735 --> 01:50:37,354
The souls of the just
are in the hands of God...

1100
01:50:37,638 --> 01:50:39,776
...where no torment
shall touch them.

1101
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:42,179
Lieutenant Purcell
has passed through...

1102
01:50:42,443 --> 01:50:45,411
...the darkening and turbulent
storms of this life.

1103
01:50:45,713 --> 01:50:50,666
He now rests in peace,
in the fair sunlight of God's presence.

1104
01:50:51,051 --> 01:50:53,124
In the Navy hymn, we sing:

1105
01:50:53,387 --> 01:50:58,341
"Lord, guard and guide those who fly
through the great spaces in the sky."

1106
01:50:58,726 --> 01:51:00,220
And salute!

1107
01:51:17,278 --> 01:51:19,896
Ready. Hut!

1108
01:51:37,597 --> 01:51:39,092
When I was gonna
detach formation...

1109
01:51:39,332 --> 01:51:42,399
...you said you were gonna
tell me something. You remember?

1110
01:51:49,342 --> 01:51:50,771
You and me, we're...

1111
01:51:51,711 --> 01:51:53,086
We're two.

1112
01:51:55,949 --> 01:51:58,338
And two is a prime number...

1113
01:51:58,985 --> 01:52:02,019
...which makes it a lucky number.

1114
01:52:05,859 --> 01:52:08,445
And I think we're very, very lucky.

1115
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:28,927
Oh, just tell me you love me,
you pussy.
