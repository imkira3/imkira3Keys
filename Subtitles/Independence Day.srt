00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,900
At the moment
our satellites are somewhat unreliable.

157
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,028
Isn't it possible
that this thing may just pass us by?

158
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,197
What if it doesn't pass us by?

159
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,741
Why don't we target some ICBMs
to blow it up?

160
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,494
And risk turning
one dangerous falling object into many?

161
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:10,415
We don't yet know enough
to make any kind of intelligent judgments.

162
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,751
Luckily the press is making up
their own story for now.

163
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,087
But that's not gonna keep.

164
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,090
- We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3.
- Absolutely.

165
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:23,886
- General, tell NORAD we're on DEFCON 3.
- That's not what the president said.

166
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,930
Isn't that a little premature?

167
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,725
We have over 50 percent of the armed forces
on weekend leave.

168
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,603
Plus the commanders and troops
that are in town for the Fourth of July parade.

169
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,482
The object has settled into a stationary orbit.

170
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,359
- Well, that's good news.
- Uh, not really, sir.

171
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,405
Part of it has broken off
into nearly three dozen pieces.

172
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,241
Smaller than the whole, sir...

173
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,910
...yet over 15 miles in width themselves.

174
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,582
Where are they heading?

175
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:56,085
They should enter our atmosphere
within the next 25 minutes.

176
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,389
Take us to DEFCON 3.

177
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:19,400
- Please say we're getting somewhere.
- There's good news and bad news.

178
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,613
- All right. What's the bad news?
- There's a penalty for disturbing my lunch.

179
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,782
And the good news is you won't charge me.

180
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,701
No. The good news is that
the problem is not our equipment.

181
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,412
It's some weird signal
embedded in the satellite feed.

182
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,498
And that's the good news?

183
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,920
Yeah. This signal has a sequential pattern,
so once I find the exact binary sequence...

184
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,464
...I can calculate the phase reversal
and apply it.

185
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,716
We should be able to block it out.

186
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,012
And then we'll be the only guys in town
with a clear picture!

187
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,140
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Oh, David! That's why I love you!

188
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,434
Oh! That's not necessary.

189
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,353
Too kind.

190
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,402
<i>(shouting)</i>

191
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,008
- This had better be good.
- Admiral on deck!

192
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,266
Sir, we're looking at a total radar blackout
over a 13km area.

193
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,768
- Let's do a diagnostic check.
- Excuse me, sir.

194
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,981
The radar may be malfunctioning,
but the infrared is totally off the map.

195
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,945
Jeez!

196
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,116
Get me Atlantic Command.

197
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,495
Hang on, sir.

198
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,124
Sir, we have visual range with incoming
over Iraqi air space.

199
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,961
- Second sighting?
- Yes, sir. Just came in from the Persian Gulf.

200
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,880
Correction, sir.

201
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,132
<i>We have two confirmed visual contacts.</i>

202
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,636
Mr. President, they're tracking another one
off the California coastline!

203
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,848
All right, put it on.
General, you might wanna watch this.

204
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,564
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are interrupting our regular broadcast...</i>

205
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,318
<i>...to bring you extraordinary events
taking place in the Russian Republic.</i>

206
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,447
<i>This unexplained disturbance
and the resulting hysteria are incredible.</i>

207
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,617
<i>How would you describe
what you are seeing?</i>

208
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,745
<i>It is clearing the mountains,
moving too slowly...</i>

209
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,080
<i>...to be a comet or meteor.</i>

210
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,792
<i>Widespread panic
has gripped the countryside...</i>

211
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,462
<i>...as thousands have taken to the streets.</i>

212
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:49,008
<i>It is confirmed. The unexplained
phenomenon is headed for Moscow.</i>

213
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,552
Mr. President,
we have an AWAC off the West Coast.

214
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,222
ETA with contact point, three minutes.

215
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,935
Don't understand it, sir.
Side radar doesn't see a thing.

216
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,604
I know! I'm blind, sir.
Nothing is registering.

217
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,775
Negative.
We have zero visibility. Visibility is at zero.

218
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,320
Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.

219
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:13,616
<i>(Grey)</i> Captain, the president is listening.
Repeat what you just told me.

220
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,953
<i>(man) We still have zero visibility.</i>

221
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,165
<i>Instrumentation is malfunctioning.</i>

222
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,044
<i>We can't get any kind of reading
on what's in front of us.</i>

223
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,212
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

224
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,549
<i>It may be clearing.</i>

225
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,766
Pull out!

226
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,572
- Line's gone, sir.
- Two more spotted over the Atlantic.

227
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,991
One's moving toward New York,
the other here.

228
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,326
- How long do we have?
- Less than 10 minutes.

229
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,245
Alex, organize a military escort.

230
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,331
Mr. President, I recommend
we move you to a secure location.

231
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:06,711
- Connie, can we expect the same panic?
- More than likely.

232
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,839
- We can discuss this on the way.
- I'm not leaving.

233
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,342
We have to maintain a working government.

234
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:18,389
Take the vice president, the whole cabinet,
and the joint chiefs to a secured location.

235
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,682
I'm staying.

236
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,769
I don't want to add to a public hysteria
that's gonna cost lives.

237
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,565
Connie, we'll initiate
the emergency broadcast system.

238
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,734
We'll advise people not to panic.

239
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,945
The best idea right now
is to stay in their homes.

240
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,905
Yes, sir. Roy? Dean?

241
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,868
Have the cabinet members rendezvous here,
we'll take them to NORAD.

242
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,997
Mr. President, with your permission,
I'd like to remain at your side.

243
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,293
I had a feeling you would.

244
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,548
And what happens
if they do become hostile?

245
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,802
Then God help us.

246
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,555
<i>There it is.
The strange atmospheric phenomenon.</i>

247
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,892
<i>It is apparently what is causing
all the distortions...</i>

248
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,355
- David, are you watching this?
- <i>(pulsing signal)</i>

249
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:14,320
<i>(TV) There is no evidence that
these phenomena are endangering anyone.</i>

250
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,656
<i>Thus far, reports of oppression...</i>

251
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:21,327
Marty, listen to this. I got a lock on
that signal pattern so we can filter it out.

252
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,830
But if my calculations are right,
it'll be gone in seven hours.

253
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,500
It's reducing itself every time it recycles...

254
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,628
...so eventually it'll disappear...

255
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,214
- Are you listening?
- Can you believe this?

256
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,511
David, haven't you been watching? David!

257
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:45,142
<i>Good afternoon. So far the phenomenon
has not caused any damage.</i>

258
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,438
We have to ask you to stay calm,
and it's important for everyone not to panic.

259
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,025
<i>We have a fix on three
of the occurrences about to appear...</i>

260
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,028
- It's just unreal.
- Hey, Miguel, come here!

261
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,781
<i>One is headed towards Los Angeles...</i>

262
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:04,036
<i>...the other two are headed towards New York
and Washington, DC.</i>

263
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,998
Marty. Marty! Jamie says this building
has an old bomb shelter.

264
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,042
We're heading down there now.

265
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,045
Okay, everybody! Head down to the basement.

266
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,632
Take it slow, don't run.
Walk down to the basement!

267
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,886
There's no shame in hiding.

268

Oh, I'd better call my mother.

Russ, I heard you had
a little trouble this morning.

272

Dusted the wrong field.

273
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:51,250
I know you're probably still a little confused
from your hostage experience.

274
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,171
Hostage experience?
Did something happen to you, Russ?

275
00:20:55,337 --> 00:21:00,593
Years back, he was kidnapped by aliens.
Did all kind of experiments on him and such.

276
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,930
Tell them about it, Russ. Get a few beers in him
and he'll tell you all about it.

277
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,932
Won't you, Russ?

278
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,145
Russ, when they took you up
in their spaceship, did they do any...

279
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,606
...sexual things?

280
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,692

Not even a four-pointer.

00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,995
- Where are we now?
- We're just commencing liftoff.

616
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,915
<i>...and refitted
with these enormous light panels...</i>

617

<i>...that are attached to the hull
and onto the sides.</i>

618

<i>(pilot) Echo One,
Welcome Wagon is in the air.</i>

619
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,172
I repeat, Welcome Wagon is in the air.

620
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,675
<i>Roger, Welcome Wagon.
Echo One, right beside you.</i>

621
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,512
This is something I would never believe
that I would be!

622
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,722
In the White House! Look at this!

623
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,476
If I knew I was gonna meet the president,
I would have worn a tie.

624
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,686
Look at me, I look like a schlemiel.

625
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,105
You look fine, Pops.

626
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,023
0v, my God!

627
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,195
- David, I don't know if he'll want to see you.
- Then we're wasting time, we should go.

628
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,532
- Why wouldn't he listen?
- Last time I saw him, we had a fight.

629
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,201
You walked in the room
and punched him in the head.

630
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,620
- The president!
- He wasn't president then.

631
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,331
I punched him, he fought back.
It was a fight!

632
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,416
A fight that you started!

633
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,418
David thought I was having an affair.

634
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,504
- With the president?
- Which I wasn't!

635
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,965
Either go get him,
or we should head back.

636
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,259
All right, I'll get him.
Wait here, and don't touch anything!

637
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,096
You punched the president?

638
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,389
God!

639
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,399
Nearing point of contact, Echo One.

640

<i>- We're closing in.
- Roger that. Begin sequence when ready.</i>

You know what famous people
have been here? Hmm?

644
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:26,581
Yes, Dad.

645
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,749
Politicians... Actors...

646
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,960
Baseball players, singers...

647
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,004
And now me!

648
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,631
Imagine that! "A poor immigrant like me..."

649
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,800
- "it's a dream!"
- Shh! David, please!

650
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,386
<i>(TV) The three choppers are approaching...</i>

651

<i>...what has been unanimously agreed
to be the front of these spaceships...</i>

652

You're leaving now?

653
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,064
- See if they've got those pens they give away.
- Dad, what?

654
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,610
I don't have a choice...

655
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,197
- I don't have time for this.
- Two minutes, Tom, please.

656
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,991
Mr. President, Julius Levinson.
David is my son.

657
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:05,369
- I told you he wouldn't listen.
- You have to tell him now.

658
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,080
David, you have to tell him!
David, tell him!

659
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,711
Uh... I know why we have satellite disruption.

660
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,715
All right. Go ahead.

0K8)'-

662
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:26,182
Let's say that you wanted to coordinate with
spaceships on different sides of the Earth.

663
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,684
They couldn't send a direct signal, right?

664
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,856
- You mean line of sight?
- Right. The curve of the Earth prevents it.

665
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:38,361
You'd need satellites to relay that signal
in order to reach each ship.

666
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,739
Well, I found a signal hidden inside...

667
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,825
...our own satellite system.

668
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:50,164
Excuse me, Mr. President. They're starting.

669
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,586
They're using our own satellites against us.

670
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,591
The clock is ticking.

671
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,348
- Bringing it in to hover.
- Welcome Wagon...

672
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,934
<i>...Echo One. Approaching alien ship.</i>

<i>Welcome Wagon has commenced.</i>

675

General Grey,

676
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:29,620
- Tell them to evacuate people from the cities.
- Yes, sir.

677
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,790
Get those helicopters away from the ship.
Call them back!

678
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,126
- What the hell's going on?
- We're leaving.

679
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,585
Kim! My daughter.

680
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,589
Uh... There's something happening here.

681
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,220

This may be a response, Echo One.

684

- She will be shortly.

Nice. Very nice.

Good! Close the door! Hatch secure!

Move out of here.

692
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:39,190
The president's ordered an evacuation.

693

- Hello. Dr. Katz, please.
- I'm sorry, he's not available.

00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,481
General Grey here.

772
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,649
AI?

773
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:50,527
All communications with the cities are down.

774
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:54,114
- All systems gone.
- For intelligence, we believe it's a total loss.

775
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,867
How about our boys? Where are they?

776
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,703
ETA to target, four minutes.

777
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:09,504
I shouldn't have left her.

778
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,506
Don't worry about it, big man.

779
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,718
I'm sure she got out of here
before it happened.

780
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:18,055

Knight One, fox three!

Knight Three, fox three!

- No, sir, not one.

Switching to Sidewinders, moving in.

Come on, come on!

802
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:15,463
They must have a protective shield
over the hull! Knights, pull up!

803
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:24,139
- Knight Three, pull up!

Blow through, blow through!

Too many of them!

808
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,657
They got another one, sir.

809
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,997
Oh, no, you did not shoot
that green shit at me!

Damn, they got shields, too!

They got another one, sir. And two more.

815

All right, get them out of there.

817
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:30,413
Squadron leaders, retreat to fallback position.
Abort mission right away!

818

We're gonna have to make a run for this one!
Let's get low and fast!

Get them out!

- They ain't got nothing for us! Let's push it!

828

- Yes, you can. Just the way I showed you.

- Nothing stupid!

Affirmative. We have incoming.

You're saying we should sacrifice
more innocent American civilians?

If we don't strike soon,
there may not be much of an America left!

01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,687
It was, what?
In the 1950s, you had that spaceship.

928
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:36,983
- Dad. Look, Dad...
- Yeah, that thing you found in New Mexico!

929
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,235
- Where was that?
- No, not the spaceship.

930
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:43,239
Roswell. Roswell, New Mexico.
No, you had the spaceship and the bodies!

931
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,658
- Come on.
- They were locked up in a bunker.

932
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:46,868
Where was that?

933
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:48,369
Area 51. Right?

934
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,914
Area 51. You knew then!
And you did nothing.

935
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,334
Sir.

936
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,254
Regardless of what
you may have read in the tabloids...

937
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:02,258
...there have never been any spacecraft
recovered by our government.

938
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,886
- Take my word for it. There's no Area 51.
- Psh...

939
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,096
And there's no recovered spaceship.

940
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,349
Uh, excuse me, Mr. President...

941
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:14,395
That's not entirely... accurate.

942
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,360
What? Which part?

943
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,534
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!

944
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,246
Sorry.

945
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:51,974
The end hath come!

946
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,686
He spaketh his word and the end hath come!

947
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:58,773
Hop on! We're heading out to El Toro!

948
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,818
You cannot defy what hath come!

949
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,988
<i>It's the end! (sobs)</i>

950
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,453
El Toro?!

951
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:21,921
- (Jasmine) Can you give me a hand?
- Sure.

952
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:30,888
Oh, God...

953
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:37,061
<i>(Boomer barks)</i>

954
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:40,147
Okay, okay, let's get this off.

955
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,358
Here, let me help you.

956
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:47,405
She's hurt pretty badly.

957
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:54,537
You know, this was supposed to be
my weekend off.

958
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,748
But, no!

959
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:02,253
You got me out here, dragging
your heavy ass through the burning desert...

960
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,715
...with your dreadlocks
sticking out the back of my parachute.

961
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,759
You gotta come down here with an attitude...

962
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,012
...acting all big and bad.

963
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,474
And what the hell is that smell?!

964
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,185
Arrrrg h!

965
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:21,564
I could've been at a barbecue!

966
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:24,525
But I ain't mad.

967
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:28,195
It's all right, it's all right.

968
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:44,420
Hey!

969
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,381
Hey! Hey...

970
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:53,846
Hey!

971
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,070
Do you need a lift, soldier?

972
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:12,281
When I flew overhead,
I saw a base not too far from here.

973
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,494
It ain't on the map.

974
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,830
Trust me, it's there.

975
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:36,722
Attention!

976
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:42,645
Mr. President. General.

977
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,815
Welcome to Area 51. Please follow me.

978
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,819
We're now 24 floors beneath the surface...

979
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,822
...and, uh... here's our main research facility.

980
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:57,326
- Let's see it.
- Sorry, sir, it's a clean room. It's static free...

981
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,787
Open... the door.

982
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,665
Yes, sir.

983
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,646
My God.

984
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,898
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?

985
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:32,236
Two words, Mr. President.
Plausible deniability.

986
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,620
I don't understand.
Where does all this come from?

987
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:44,373
How do you get funding
for something like this?

988
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,626
You don't actually think
they spend $20,000 on a hammer...

989
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,837
...$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?

990
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,008
Mr. President, this is Dr. Okun.

991
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:58,345
He has headed up the research department
on this project for the last 15 years.

992
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,474
How do you do?

993
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,518
<i>(gasps) Mr. President!</i>

994
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,562
Wow!

995
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:07,772
Uh... This...

996
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,982
What a pleasure!

997
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:12,234
As you can imagine, they...

998
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,278
They don't let us out much.

999
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,157
I can understand that. <i>(clears</i> throat)

1000
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,618
Well!

1001
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:24,538
I guess you'd like to see the big tamale, huh?

1002
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:26,040
Follow me.

1003
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,218
She's a beaut, ain't she?

1004
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:26,767
As you can see from the repairs, we've been
trying to put her back together since the '60s.

1005
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:29,854
You've had this for 40 years
and you know nothing about them?

1006
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,272
Oh, hell, no.

1007
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:33,607
No, no, no, no. We know tons about them.

1008
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:36,360
But the neatest stuff...

1009
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:39,530
The neatest stuff has
only happened in the last few days.

1010
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:44,285
We can't duplicate their type of power
so we've never been able to experiment.

1011
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:49,456
But since these guys started showing up,
all the little gizmos inside turned on.

1012
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:53,127
(laughs) The last 24 hours
have been really exciting!

1013
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:55,629
Exciting? People are dying out there.

1014
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:58,424
Exciting isn't the word
I'd choose to describe it!

1015
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:03,053
You guys are hoping to fly this thing, huh?

1016
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,556
You said you can repair their technology.

1017
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:09,476
- Can you tell us anything useful about them?
- Oh, yeah. Well, I mean...

1018
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:11,770
They're not all that dissimilar from us.

1019
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:16,192
Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold.

1020
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:19,153
Probably why they're interested in our planet.

1021
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,739
Hey...

1022
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,449
Hey-

1023
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:26,452
You guys wanna see them?

1024
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:29,413
Hmm?

1025
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,047
Uh, this is...

1026
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,257
This is the vault.

1027
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,885
Or, as some of us have come to call it...

1028
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:46,013
<i>...the freak show. (chuckles)</i>

1029
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,246
When we found them...

1030
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,749
...they were wearing
some sort of biomechanical suits.

1031
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,419
Once we got them off,
we learned a great deal about their anatomy.

1032
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,755
Eyes, ears...

1033
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,590
...no vocal cords.

1034
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:25,135
We assume they communicate
with each other by some other means.

1035
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:29,473
You're obviously not thinking
about hand signals and body language.

1036
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,477
No, it's some kind of
extrasensory perception. Telepathy.

1037
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,229
So...

1038
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,566
It's an organic life form.

1039
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,488
Can they be killed?

1040
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,657
Their bodies are just as frail as ours.

1041
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:49,243
These two died in the crash.

1042
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,245
This one a few weeks later.

1043
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:55,374
You just... have to get through
their technology, which is...

1044
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,502
...I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.

1045
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:03,257
David, you unlocked part
of their technology.

1046
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:08,012
- You cracked the code.
- No, no. All I did was stumble on their, urn...

1047
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:11,307
...signal. I don't know
how, uh... helpful I can be.

1048
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,643
Why don't you show him
what you've discovered so far?

1049
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:18,272
Figure out what they haven't thought of yet.

1050
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:23,819
We'll see if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

1051
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:35,080
What code?

1052
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:58,270
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

1053
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:01,106
I'm sorry, captain. You don't have clearance.

1054
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:04,109
Okay. Come here.

1055
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:05,986
You wanna see my clearance?

1056
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:09,281
<i>(gasps)</i>

1057
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:12,785
- Maybe I'll just leave this here with you.
- Let them pass.

1058
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,996
- Let them pass!
- Get the hell out of the way!

1059
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,083
Did you see that?

1060
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,710
Come on down.

1061
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,212
Watch your step.

1062
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:28,801
Well, obviously this cockpit
was designed to seat three.

1063
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,387
Though how they sat on them, I don't know.

1064
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:32,763
<i>(David) Gently.</i>

1065
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:35,557
- Uh... You see these gizmos flashing?
- Yeah.

1066
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:39,228
We've been working around the clock
trying to get a fix on all this.

1067
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:41,313
Some stuff we figured out right away.

1068
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:45,651
Uh... This we're pretty sure
is the life support for the cabin.

1069
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:48,779
(coughs) And, uh...
this doohickey is connected to...

1070
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:54,701
Oh... Well, it was connected to the engine.
Here, take that, will you?

1071
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:59,248
Uh... These configurations... uh...

1072
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:05,379
Well... To be honest,
we don't know what the hell this crap is.

1073
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:11,427
But this is clearly what they use
to guide and navigate their craft.

1074
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,595
Ha-ha! Neat, huh?

1075
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:18,183
Uh, could somebody grab my laptop there?
Can I just have the computer inside?

1076
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,184
What?

1077
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:23,147
These patterns are repeating sequentially,
like their countdown signal.

1078
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:26,608
They're using that frequency
for computer communications.

1079
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:30,028
See? That's how
they're coordinating their ships.

1080
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,864
You know...

1081
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,491
...you're really starting to make us look bad.

1082
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:44,793
They got one! They got one alive!

1083
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,837
- They got one, alive!
- Jesus!

1084
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:49,381
Uh... You'll be okay by yourself, Dave?

1085
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:50,883
Fine.

1086
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,093
Uh... Don't touch anything.

1087
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,390
Everybody's always telling me
not to touch anything.

1088
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,479
Oh! It's all wet...

1089
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,407
Right here! He's in the back of the pickup.

1090
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:23,832
General, sir. Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

1091
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,667
Guess who's coming to dinner!

1092
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:29,505
I need a doctor. I need a doctor!

1093
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,718
Oh, boy! How long
has he been unconscious?

1094
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:37,304
- About three hours.
- Let's get him in containment.

1095
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:40,974
My son... he's very sick.
He needs immediate attention!

1096
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,977
He's drying out.
I want him sprayed down with saline.

1097
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:47,272
He has a problem with his adrenal cortex!
Please!

1098
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:53,070
If you don't do something right now,
my son will die!

1099
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:57,449
- Just help him!
- Okay. O'Haver, Miller, you come with us.

1100
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:00,452
You... take us to him, okay? Let's go.

1101
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,207
All right! Move it, move it, move it!

1102
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:09,336
As the former head of the CIA,
you knew about this place.

1103
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:10,837
When were you planning to inform us?

1104
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,133
- It had been deemed classified.
- You should have told us about this

1105
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,343
when they first arrived!

1106
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:19,638
You should have warned us
before we launched a counterattack...

1107
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:22,307
...that cost the lives of hundreds of our pilots!

1108
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:26,478
We could not have known that our fighters
would have been that ineffective!

1109
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:27,813
Mr. President.

1110
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:31,692
The little bit of information we have
comes directly into this room.

1111
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:35,070
Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

1112
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:36,947
Destroyed.

1113
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:41,326
NATO and Western Allied installations
were the first to be taken out.

1114
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:42,869
Then we were hit.

1115
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:46,123
They knew exactly where and how to hit us.

1116
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,375
- And our forces?
- We're down to 15 percent.

1117
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:53,589
If you calculate the time it takes
to destroy a city and move on...

1118
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:57,926
...we're looking at the worldwide destruction
of every major city...

1119
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:01,096
...in the next 36 hours.

1120
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,225
We're being exterminated.

1121
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,689
Mr. President!

1122
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:13,150
This is Captain Steven Hiller.

1123
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:14,693
- Captain.
- Mr. President.

1124
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:15,902
Well done.

1125
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:19,364
- Where is it now?
- It's isolated in the containment lab, sir.

1126
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,743
I'd like to go see it.

1127
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:31,543
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

1128
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:36,298
Hasn't anyone told you?

1129
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,845
El Toro has been completely destroyed.

1130
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:36,942
- We were lucky.
- Yeah!

1131
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,569
Today was the first time I used the subway.

1132
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:41,697
Thank God for the Metro Rail.

1133
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:44,241
These should last us a while.

1134
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:46,618
Don't move. I'll get it for you.
Stay still.

1135
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,539
He's your son?

1136
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:52,332
He's my angel.

1137
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,836
Was his father stationed here?

1138
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:58,004
No, he, uh...

1139
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,215
He wasn't his father.

1140
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:04,094
But I was kind of hoping
he wanted the job, though.

1141
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:11,643
- So what do you do for a living?
- I'm a dancer.

1142
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,521
Oh... Ballet...

1143
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:17,441
No. Exotic.

1144
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,945
Oh... Sorry.

1145
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:24,489
Don't be. I'm not.

1146
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,075
It's good money. Besides...

1147
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,077
...my baby's worth it.

1148
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,371
Dylan! Come here.

1149
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:33,623
I want you to meet the First Lady.

1150
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:40,255
- Hello.
- Hi.

1151
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,758
I didn't know that you'd recognized me.

1152
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,926
Well, I didn't want to say nothing.

1153
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,012
I voted for the other guy.

1154
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:54,352
- Life-support monitors recording.
- So if we screw up, it's all on tape.

1155
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:55,771
Come on, come on.

1156
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,564
Let's get this biomechanical suit off.

1157
01:27:57,731 --> 01:28:00,275
Put the spreader right here, along the ridge.

1158
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:04,404
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here.
Pick there. Good.

1159
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,699
All right, now spread it very, very gently.

1160

Let me get in.

1161

We are on station and awaiting instructions.

1241
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,312
Break formation. Head to targets.

1242
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:40,777
Sir.

1243
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:42,737
They're breaking formation.

1244
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:47,075
- We're initiating sequence code.
- Verification: Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

1245
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:48,993
Which city will be reached first?

1246
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,538
Houston, Texas.
ETA, six minutes and counting down.

1247
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:55,541
- Houston.
- The major cities have been deserted.

1248
01:35:55,708 --> 01:36:00,338
Civilian casualties should
be down to a minimum.

1249
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:05,218
Command, this is Neighborhood Watch.

1250
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:06,803
We are in position.

1251
01:36:07,387 --> 01:36:09,430
Tracking monitors are locked on.

1252
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:12,308
We are going to visual recon.

1253
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:14,102
<i>Roger.</i>

1254
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:20,858
- We have confirmation.
- Launch code confirmed.

1255
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:24,320
Alpha Zulu six eight niner, standing by.

1256
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,325
Laser targeting.

1257
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:30,910
Locked on.

1258
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:34,372
We're locked on, sir.
Do you wish to deploy?

1259
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:41,421
Mr. President,
if you wish to deploy, the time is now.

1260
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:50,305
- Mr. President?
- Deploy.

1261
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:53,224
That's a go. Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

1262
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:54,809
Here we go.

1263
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:04,610
Bird's away.

1264
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:07,947
We have visual confirmation of the missile.
It's on target.

1265
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,241
<i>Approaching.</i>

1266
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,869
May our children forgive us.

1267
01:37:13,036 --> 01:37:16,164
<i>Five seconds to impact. Three, two...</i>

1268
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:17,457
<i>"CH6.</i>

1269
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:21,419
Oh, yeah! It's a hit!

1270
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:28,343
Get down! Get down!

1271
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:31,179
Can we confirm
that the target was destroyed?

1272
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:34,182
Get the tank commander.
Confirm the target was destroyed.

1273
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:35,350
Yes, sir!

1274
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:38,686
- Red Arrow, Alpha 9723. Can you read?
- (radio crackles)

1275
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:41,856
- Repeat. You're breaking up.
- We have <i>lost</i> visual.

1276
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:44,484
Roger that. We're looking for confirmation.

1277
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,117
- We got the bastards.
- Yeah!

1278
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:56,245
Good job, everyone! Congratulations.

1279
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:01,709
Commander, do you have visual?
We need visual confirmation.

1280
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:03,503
Has the target been destroyed?

1281
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:18,935
Negative.

1282
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:24,148
<i>Target remains.</i>

1283
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:29,821
<i>I repeat, target remains.</i>

1284
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,034
<i>(sighs)</i> Call the other planes back.

1285
01:38:35,201 --> 01:38:38,955
Other bombers might have more luck.
We shouldn't just give up on this!

1286
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:41,374
I said call them back!

1287
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:46,671
- Abort.
- Abort mission.

1288
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:50,758
Issue the abort codes right away.
This is an abort, full abort. Do you read?

1289
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:32,008
(Hi//er) Jasmine!

1290
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,646
You're late!

1291
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:48,524
You know I like to make an entrance.

1292
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:00,036
- Where are we going?
- Through there, sir.

1293
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:03,539
Mr. President. Your wife is resting
comfortably for the moment.

1294
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:08,294
- Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier...
- Hey, there she is! Go on!

1295
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:14,467
- She doesn't look too good.
- Your wife is bleeding internally.

1296
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:18,221
- Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier...
- What are you saying?

1297
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:20,806
We can't stop the bleeding.

1298
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,518
If We'd...

1299
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:25,811
There's nothing we can do for her.

1300
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:30,316
We were worried.
We didn't know where you were.

1301
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:37,657
You've gotten bigger, I think.

1302
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:39,867
I did?

1303
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,205
You just keep growing and growing.

1304
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:48,084
I can't...

1305
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:51,212
Hey-

1306
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:55,800
Can you, uh, wait outside for a little bit
so Mom can get a rest?

1307
01:40:55,967 --> 01:40:57,468
Hey, come on, Munchkin.

1308
01:41:07,144 --> 01:41:10,731
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home
when you asked me to.

1309
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,733
Oh...

1310
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:14,944
It's okay.

1311
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:18,781
The doctors...

1312
01:41:20,283 --> 01:41:22,243
...think that you're...

1313
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:24,453
...gonna be just fine.

1314
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:28,958
Liar.

1315
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:27,183
Is Mommy sleeping now?

1316
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:30,645
Yeah.

1317
01:42:32,063 --> 01:42:34,148
Mommy's sleeping.

1318
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:39,195
Hey-

1319
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:08,683
<i>(crashing metal)</i>

1320
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:11,060
David!

1321
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:14,647
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm making a mess!

1322
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:16,357
Yeah. This I can see.

1323
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:19,151
We gotta burn this toxic waste...

1324
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,529
...pollute the air and rip up the ozone!

1325
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:24,240
Because maybe if we screw
this planet up enough...

1326
01:43:25,282 --> 01:43:27,284
...they won't want it anymore.

1327
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,036
Wait, wait, wait. David, David.

1328
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:32,373
- Don't do this to yourself. Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

1329
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:35,668
Everyone loses faith
at some point in their life.

1330
01:43:35,835 --> 01:43:38,087
David! Even myself.

1331
01:43:39,422 --> 01:43:42,133
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.

1332
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:49,849
You see, sometimes...

1333
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:52,143
...we have to remember what we still have.

1334
01:43:53,519 --> 01:43:55,104
Like what?

1335
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:01,902
Well... you still have your health.

1336
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:03,863
David, David, you need your rest.

1337
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:08,826
Come on! Get off this freezing floor
before you catch cold. Come on!

1338
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:14,165
- What did you just say?
- About faith?

1339
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:16,959
- Well, you see, a man...
- No, no, no.

1340
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:21,756
- No, the other part.
- What? What? I don't want you to catch cold.

1341
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:26,802
Dahhh!

1342
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:29,346
What is that? What is the matter with you?

1343
01:44:29,513 --> 01:44:32,433
- Genius.
- Genius?

1344
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:35,394
My dad. A total genius.

1345
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:39,106
Jerry, wake up.

1346
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:42,234
We got work to do.
Get everybody down here right away.

1347
01:44:46,363 --> 01:44:47,740
Look at that!

1348
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:51,243
Wow!
Does that thing really fly in outer space?

1349
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,871
- It most certainly does.
- Sure doesn't look like it.

1350
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:58,542
- They're here.
- All right, what's this all about?

1351
01:44:58,709 --> 01:44:59,877
I have no idea.

1352
01:45:00,044 --> 01:45:01,253
Get everybody off.

1353
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:04,715
Right, everybody.
Clear the platform. Let's go.

1354
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:06,217
Major Mitchell.

1355
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,177
- Do you have a pistol?
- What?

1356
01:45:08,344 --> 01:45:11,347
- Have you got a gun?
- Sergeant, your sidearm.

1357
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,726
See that, uh... Coke can
on top of the alien craft?

1358
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:18,020
Think you can shoot that thing off?

1359
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:19,855
Do it. Shoot it.

1360
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:22,983
- Sir?
- Go ahead.

1361
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:30,991
What the hell are you doing?!

1362
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:33,160
I'm sorry. My fault, my fault.

1363
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:36,664
You see, that Coke can
was protected by the craft's shield.

1364
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:39,333
- We can't penetrate it.
- We know. What's your point?

1365
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:44,004
My point is, if we can't beat their defenses,
then we gotta get around them.

1366
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:47,758
Major. One more time... Any time.

1367
01:45:59,019 --> 01:46:01,981
- How did you do that?
- I gave it a cold.

1368
01:46:03,148 --> 01:46:06,610
I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

1369
01:46:07,236 --> 01:46:09,530
Are you telling us you can send out a signal...

1370
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:11,699
...that will disable all their shields?

1371
01:46:11,866 --> 01:46:15,035
That's right.
Just like they used our satellites against us...

1372
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:17,329
...we can use their own signal against them.

1373
01:46:17,496 --> 01:46:20,207
If we plant a virus into that mother ship...

1374
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:23,961
...it's gonna filter down
into all the corresponding ships below.

1375
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,963
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

1376
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:30,509
How exactly do we infect the mother ship
with this virus?

1377
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:33,679
We're... We're gonna, uh...

1378
01:46:34,305 --> 01:46:38,851
...have to... um... fly their alien craft
out of our atmosphere and dock with it.

1379
01:46:39,018 --> 01:46:42,897
We can enter here,
as shown in these satellite photos.

1380
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:47,693
We then upload the virus, set off
some kind of explosion which will disable it.

1381
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:53,741
That'll disorient the smaller ships below
and that could buy you some time to, uh...

1382
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:57,328
to... take them... take them out.
Take them down.

1383
01:46:57,494 --> 01:47:00,080
Do your... Do your stuff.

1384
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:04,209
- This is ridiculous!
- How long would their shields be down?

1385
01:47:05,127 --> 01:47:08,088
Uh... I don't know. A matter of minutes.

1386
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:11,550
You want us to coordinate
a worldwide counterstrike...

1387
01:47:11,717 --> 01:47:13,594
...with a window of a few minutes?

1388
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:17,222
- With shields down, it might be possible.
- Oh, please!

1389
01:47:17,389 --> 01:47:21,101
We don't have the manpower or the resources
to launch that kind of a campaign!

1390
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:23,687
Not to mention
that this whole cockamamie plan...

1391
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:27,608
...depends on a machine that no one
in this world is qualified to operate.

1392
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:30,277
I wouldn't say that, sir.

1393
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:34,281
I've seen them in action.
I'm aware of their maneuvering capabilities.

1394
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:38,577
With your permission, general,
I'd like the opportunity to try.

1395
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:41,747
That thing is a wreck.

1396
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,916
It crash-landed back in the '50s.

1397
01:47:44,083 --> 01:47:46,377
We don't even know if it's capable of flying!

1398
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:48,963
Jim, uh... remove the clamps.

1399
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:12,945
Any questions?

1400
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:19,702
Let's do it.

1401
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:24,790
All right, you heard the president...

1402
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:28,335
- Good luck, pilot.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

1403
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:30,587
A virus.

1404
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:32,923
Your idea.

1405
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:35,134
That's right.

1406
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:43,809
Do you really think you can fly that thing?

1407
01:48:43,976 --> 01:48:47,479
Do you really think
you can do all that bullshit you just said?

1408
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:55,946
Whoo!

1409
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:58,699
I understand you are upset
over your wife's death.

1410
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:01,702
But that's no excuse
for making another fatal mistake.

1411
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:06,373
No, my mistake was to appoint a sniveling
weasel like you as Secretary of Defense.

1412
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:09,293
- You don't understand!
- However...

1413
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:13,047
...that is one mistake I am thankful to say
that I don't have to live with.

1414
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:15,215
- Mr. President...
- Mr. Nimziki...

1415
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:16,800
...you're fired.

1416
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:24,475
Let's organize every plane we can find
and get us some goddamn pilots to fly them.

1417
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:25,893
Yes, sir.

1418
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:27,603
He can't do that.

1419
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:30,564
Well, hejust, uh... did.

1420
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:38,739
Command has attempted to list casualties
and losses, but information is sketchy.

1421
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:41,700
We know we've lost
the Belgian contingent in the Sinai.

1422
01:49:41,867 --> 01:49:45,913
There's a strong possibility reinforcements
are hiding in the Golan Straits.

1423
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,916
<i>(speaks Arabic)</i>

1424
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:53,087
- What the hell's he saying?
- They're getting a signal. Old Morse code.

1425
01:50:01,303 --> 01:50:03,388
<i>(ArabiC)</i>

1426
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:08,102
It's from the Americans.

1427
01:50:09,478 --> 01:50:11,730
They want to organize a counteroffensive!

1428
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:14,900
It's about bloody time!
What do they plan to do?

1429
01:50:19,822 --> 01:50:21,615
<i>(in Russian)</i>

1430
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:35,170
(in Japanese)

1431
01:50:37,172 --> 01:50:40,384
We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions...

1432
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:45,681
- ...in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
- Impressive. Considering it's all done with...

1433
01:50:45,848 --> 01:50:47,141
<i>(Grey)</i> Morse code.

1434
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:51,270
- The armed forces here?
- We have sufficient aircraft, but...

1435
01:50:51,436 --> 01:50:54,648
- But what?
- Pilots are coming up short.

1436
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:56,733
Well, then, find them.

1437
01:50:56,900 --> 01:51:01,405
<i>Ham radio operators from New York to Japan
trade rumors of military forces in hiding...</i>

1438
01:51:01,572 --> 01:51:05,784
<i>...unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation...</i>

1439
01:51:06,785 --> 01:51:09,204
We're planning to launch a counteroffensive.

1440
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:10,956
With our depleted manpower...

1441
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:14,418
...we're asking that anyone with
flight experience come forward.

1442
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:19,590
Military training is preferable,
but anyone who can fly would be useful.

1443
01:51:20,465 --> 01:51:22,926
I can fly. I'm a pilot.

1444
01:51:25,596 --> 01:51:27,347
All right, guys! Listen up!

1445
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:31,310
Pay attention. These F-18s are
very different than the jets you piloted.

1446
01:51:31,476 --> 01:51:33,645
- It's strong.
- Forgive the expression...

1447
01:51:33,812 --> 01:51:36,648
...but this is a crash course
in modern avionics.

1448
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:39,359
- Keep it coming.
- Okay, you got it!

1449
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,695
All right, listen up. Before we begin...

1450
01:51:41,862 --> 01:51:45,115
...we need some background information
on your experience.

1451
01:51:45,282 --> 01:51:47,284
Let's start with you.

1452
01:51:47,451 --> 01:51:48,660
Who, me?

1453
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:52,956
Well, I'm, uh, Russell Casse, sir.

1454
01:51:54,249 --> 01:51:58,295
And, uh... after 'Nam,
I got into crop-dusting.

1455
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:01,632
And, uh... been doing that ever since.

1456
01:52:02,174 --> 01:52:06,595
On a personal note, sir,
I'd just like to add that, uh...

1457
01:52:07,095 --> 01:52:10,974
...ever since I was kidnapped
by aliens 10 years ago...

1458
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:13,060
...I have been dying for some payback.

1459
01:52:13,227 --> 01:52:17,481
I just want you to know
that, uh... I won't let you down.

1460
01:52:19,024 --> 01:52:21,068
You have one tactical nuclear missile...

1461
01:52:21,235 --> 01:52:24,488
...we're loading into this launcher
under the right wing.

1462
01:52:24,655 --> 01:52:26,573
This is the firing mechanism.

1463
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:29,284
It'll be attached to the ship's main console.

1464
01:52:29,451 --> 01:52:31,578
Just like the Amraam launch pad
on a Stealth.

1465
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:34,331
Except the nuke will not detonate at impact.

1466
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:38,335
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses out of there.

1467
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:40,963
Good luck, gentlemen.

1468
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,382
30 seconds.

1469
01:52:43,548 --> 01:52:47,719
It's the strongest radio transmitter we had.
It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.

1470
01:52:47,886 --> 01:52:50,764
30 seconds. Don't you think
that's cutting it too close?

1471
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:54,643
We're gonna be well on our way back home
before we shoot that thing off.

1472
01:52:56,311 --> 01:52:58,397
Why you? David!

1473
01:52:58,814 --> 01:53:01,358
I don't... I don't understand...

1474
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:05,195
...why you can't show
someone else how to plant the virus.

1475
01:53:05,362 --> 01:53:07,072
No, no. Something may go wrong.

1476
01:53:07,239 --> 01:53:10,075
I may have to think quickly,
adjust the signal.

1477
01:53:10,242 --> 01:53:13,912
Who knows? Hey, you know how
I'm always trying to save the planet?

1478
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:20,794
Here's my chance.

1479
01:53:23,213 --> 01:53:25,215
Now he gets ambitious.

1480
01:53:25,882 --> 01:53:28,635
- It's too tight.
- Well, I had to borrow it. Let me see.

1481
01:53:28,802 --> 01:53:31,555
Okay. All right, I guess that's good enough.

1482
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:33,807
So. How do I look?

1483
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:37,602
Oh, thank you. You're a lot of help.

1484
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:42,774
- You're late!
- Well, you know me.

1485
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:45,819
I know. You like to make a big entrance.

1486
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:50,157
Listen. Before we do this,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1487
01:53:50,324 --> 01:53:52,409
Sorry for what, babe?

1488
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:56,246
I should have done this a long time ago.

1489
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:59,750
- Do you have the ring?
- Uh... Yes, sir.

1490
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:02,836
- Here, make yourself useful.
- Ow!

1491
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:06,298
Vvflnesses?

1492
01:54:06,465 --> 01:54:08,508
(both) Um...

1493
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:13,430
- We got hung up.
- Well, let's get this show on the road.

1494
01:54:13,597 --> 01:54:17,351
Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here in the sight of God...

1495
01:54:17,517 --> 01:54:20,312
...and in the presence of these witnesses...

1496
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:23,398
...to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

1497
01:54:23,565 --> 01:54:27,486
Any person who can show good cause
why these two should not wed...

1498
01:54:27,652 --> 01:54:31,156
...please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1499
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:37,287
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife...

1500
01:54:37,454 --> 01:54:40,499
...to live together with her
in the holy state of matrimony?

1501
01:54:41,375 --> 01:54:46,129
Will you love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health...

1502
01:54:46,296 --> 01:54:48,548
...and, forsaking all others...

1503
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:52,677
...keep yourself only for her
as long as you both shall live?

1504
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:55,222
I Will.

1505
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,474
<i>(softly) Whoo!</i>

1506
01:55:06,608 --> 01:55:08,693
Good morning.

1507
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:14,282
They're a little young.

1508
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:17,035
That they are.

1509
01:55:18,286 --> 01:55:20,372
They look a little nervous.

1510
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:24,126
I need all flight crews
to report to their designated areas.

1511
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:28,255
- Major. Can I borrow that?
- Sir.

1512
01:55:29,714 --> 01:55:31,383
Good morning.

1513
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:34,553
<i>(amplified) Good morning.</i>

1514
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:39,683
In less than an hour...

1515
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:44,479
...aircraft from here
will join others from around the world.

1516
01:55:44,646 --> 01:55:50,193
And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.

1517
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:53,071
Mankind.

1518
01:55:53,238 --> 01:55:57,075
That... word should have
new meaning for all of us today.

1519
01:55:58,618 --> 01:56:01,830
We can't be consumed
by our petty differences any more.

1520
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:06,501
We will be united in our common interest.

1521
01:56:07,335 --> 01:56:11,381
Perhaps it's fate
that today is the Fourth of July.

1522
01:56:12,591 --> 01:56:15,886
And you will once again
be fighting for our freedom.

1523
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:20,390
Not from tyranny, oppression or persecution.

1524
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:25,061
But from annihilation.

1525
01:56:26,021 --> 01:56:28,356
We're fighting for our right to live.

1526
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:31,443
To exist.

1527
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:34,696
And should we win the day...

1528
01:56:35,572 --> 01:56:39,910
...the Fourth of July will no longer
be known as an American holiday...

1529
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:44,080
...but as the day
when the world declared in one voice...

1530
01:56:44,247 --> 01:56:46,708
..."We will not go quietly into the night!"

1531
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:50,504
"We will not vanish without a fight!"

1532
01:56:51,463 --> 01:56:53,548
"We're going to live on!"

1533
01:56:54,132 --> 01:56:56,218
"We're going to survive!"

1534
01:56:57,010 --> 01:57:01,056
Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!

1535
01:57:01,223 --> 01:57:03,266
<i>(cheering)</i>

1536
01:57:03,934 --> 01:57:05,143
Yeah!

1537
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:28,708
- Let's go!
- Mr. President. Right this way, sir.

1538
01:57:29,209 --> 01:57:31,378
- I've got your gear over here.
- Good luck!

1539
01:57:31,545 --> 01:57:35,840
I've got you a jumpsuit and your gear is here.
You've got your choice of helmets.

1540
01:57:38,635 --> 01:57:41,137
Mr. President,
I'd sure like to know what you're doing.

1541
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:43,848
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

1542
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:48,270
I belong in the air.

1543
01:57:54,818 --> 01:57:57,445
Okay, sir. Let's get you airborne.

1544
01:58:00,699 --> 01:58:03,868
As soon as I get back,
we're gonna light those fireworks, right?

1545
01:58:11,585 --> 01:58:13,920

Shaky, huh?
Is it gonna do this the whole way?

1570
02:00:58,251 --> 02:01:01,004
Make sure your seat backs

No, I got it.
Some jerk didn't put the thing...

Yes, yes. Yes, without the "oops".

02:13:44,934 --> 02:13:47,061
- Who is that guy?
- Put him on speaker.

1706
02:13:47,228 --> 02:13:49,480
- Pilot, identify yourself.
- <i>It's</i> me!

1707
02:13:49,647 --> 02:13:51,273
<i>Russell Casse, sir.</i>

1708
02:13:52,066 --> 02:13:54,068
I told you I wouldn't let you down!

1709
02:13:54,235 --> 02:13:57,279
<i>Just keep those guys off me
for a few more seconds, will you?</i>

1710
02:13:57,446 --> 02:14:02,576
Okay. Echo Niner, Echo Seven, take
flanking positions. Look after this guy, okay?

1711
02:14:03,035 --> 02:14:07,081
All right, boys.
Let's give Mr. Casse some cover!

1712
02:14:07,248 --> 02:14:09,458
Gentlemen! Let's plow the road!

1713
02:14:17,424 --> 02:14:19,385
We'll draw them off and it's all yours!

1714
02:14:20,010 --> 02:14:22,638
Oh-ho! Look out! Coming through!

1715
02:14:24,265 --> 02:14:25,683
I've got tone.

1716
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:30,354
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1717
02:14:37,528 --> 02:14:39,363
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1718
02:14:42,658 --> 02:14:44,034
It's jammed.

1719
02:14:45,035 --> 02:14:46,870
<i>It won't fire.</i>

1720
02:14:49,999 --> 02:14:51,458
Damn it!

1721
02:15:02,177 --> 02:15:04,263
Do me a favor.

1722
02:15:06,223 --> 02:15:10,060
Tell my children... I love them very much.

1723
02:15:13,105 --> 02:15:15,316
All right, you alien assholes!

1724
02:15:16,358 --> 02:15:18,944
In the words of my generation...

1725
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:22,990
...up yours!

1726
02:15:23,574 --> 02:15:24,950
Dad! What's he doing?

1727
02:15:25,117 --> 02:15:26,368
<i>Come on, baby!</i>

1728
02:15:26,535 --> 02:15:28,621
Come on, baby, come on!

1729
02:15:31,624 --> 02:15:33,000
Good luck, buddy.

1730
02:15:39,923 --> 02:15:45,721
(laughing) Hello, boys! I'm back!

1731
02:16:06,742 --> 02:16:08,535
He did it!

1732
02:16:08,702 --> 02:16:10,704
The son of a bitch did it!

1733
02:16:13,707 --> 02:16:14,917
All right!

1734
02:16:37,398 --> 02:16:39,441
What your father did was very brave.

1735
02:16:41,276 --> 02:16:43,112
You should be proud of him.

1736
02:16:43,821 --> 02:16:45,406
I am.

1737
02:17:03,132 --> 02:17:07,344
We know how to take them out, general.
Spread the word.

1738
02:17:10,347 --> 02:17:13,809
Get on the wire to every squadron
around the world.

1739
02:17:13,976 --> 02:17:17,229
Tell them how to bring
those sons of bitches down.

1740
02:17:30,993 --> 02:17:32,453
What do you think?

1741
02:17:33,495 --> 02:17:35,873
<i>(sighs) Checkmate.</i>

1742
02:18:01,315 --> 02:18:04,818
Well, it's funny. I always thought
things like these would kill me.

1743
02:18:05,778 --> 02:18:06,904
<i>(chuckles)</i>

1744
02:18:09,072 --> 02:18:10,532
Thank you.

1745
02:18:18,332 --> 02:18:19,917
It's been a pleasure.

1746
02:18:20,876 --> 02:18:22,836
Steve, you too.

1747
02:18:26,882 --> 02:18:28,717
Only one thing left to do.

1748
02:18:34,515 --> 02:18:36,225
Ready?

1749
02:18:36,391 --> 02:18:38,060
Yes, sir.

1750
02:18:44,441 --> 02:18:47,569
Hey, all right! Look at us!

1751
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:51,073
Take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

1752
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:54,243
- Y'all take care. Nothing but love for you!
- Goodbye!

1753
02:18:56,078 --> 02:18:58,413
Do you think they know
what's about to happen?

1754
02:18:58,580 --> 02:19:00,958
Oh, not a chance in hell. Good night!

1755
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:08,006
<i>(laughter)</i>

1756
02:19:08,173 --> 02:19:09,216
Peace!

1757
02:19:23,438 --> 02:19:25,649
We're loose.
Can you get us out of here in 3O seconds?

1758
02:19:25,816 --> 02:19:27,150
I ain't heard no fat lady!

1759
02:19:27,317 --> 02:19:29,862
Forget the fat lady.
Drive us out of here!

1760
02:19:37,786 --> 02:19:40,247
- They're chasing us.
- Oh, really. You think?

1761
02:19:48,672 --> 02:19:52,467
- Oh, that was a hit. I took a hit.
- We're not hit! Stop side-seat driving!

1762
02:19:56,305 --> 02:19:58,640
Left, left! Tunnel, tunnel! Exit left!

1763
02:19:58,807 --> 02:20:01,643
- Where the hell do you think I'm going?
- Okay, okay. We're...

1764
02:20:20,412 --> 02:20:22,664
- They're closing up on us.
- Shut up, shut up!

1765
02:20:22,831 --> 02:20:26,168
Go faster, must go faster, must go faster.
Go, go, go, go, go!

1766
02:20:26,335 --> 02:20:28,629
Aah!

1767
02:20:37,846 --> 02:20:39,181
Oh!

1768
02:20:39,348 --> 02:20:41,433
Elvis has left the building!

1769
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:43,602
<i>(imitating Elvis)</i> Thank <i>you very</i> much.

1770
02:20:43,769 --> 02:20:45,854
Oh, I love you, man.

1771
02:22:16,778 --> 02:22:20,032
They're going down all over the world, Tom.
We got them beat.

1772
02:22:20,198 --> 02:22:22,951
How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?

1773
02:22:26,788 --> 02:22:32,294
We lost contact with Captain Hiller
and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago.

1774
02:22:35,088 --> 02:22:36,131
Hold it!

1775
02:22:36,798 --> 02:22:39,468
Hold on, sir. I've got something on radar.

1776
02:23:26,681 --> 02:23:28,600
Sorry, sir.

1777
02:23:29,351 --> 02:23:30,602
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1778
02:23:30,769 --> 02:23:33,522
- Well done, captain.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1779
02:23:41,029 --> 02:23:42,155
David...

1780
02:23:44,658 --> 02:23:46,368
Not bad.

1781
02:23:49,538 --> 02:23:52,207
Thank you, Mr. President.

1782
02:23:53,041 --> 02:23:54,876
Not too bad at all.

1783
02:23:56,044 --> 02:23:58,171
Oh, so this is healthy?

1784
02:23:58,630 --> 02:24:00,715
Oh... I could get used to it.

1785
02:24:18,567 --> 02:24:21,111
Happy Fourth of July, Daddy.

1786
02:24:21,278 --> 02:24:23,363
Same to you, Munchkin.

1787
02:24:25,198 --> 02:24:27,534
Didn't I promise you fireworks?

1788
02:24:27,701 --> 02:24:29,077
Yeah.

1789
02:24:30,305 --> 02:25:30,500
