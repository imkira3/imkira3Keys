8
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,450
Hey, Ash. Where are we?

9
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,850
Well, we just crossed
the Tennessee border.

10
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,650
- Which would put us...
- Yeah?

11
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,750
Which would put us...

12
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:49,875
Right...

13
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:52,826
...Here!

14
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,223
Turn!

15
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,650
What the hell was that?
Are you trying to kill us?

16
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:08,450
Don't blame me! It's your steering wheel!
Damn thing jerked right out of my hands.

17
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:11,950
I don't understand it.
I had this thing in for a tune-up yesterday
and they said they'd go over everything.

18
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:17,050
Well you better take it back
because the damn thing don't work.
The one thing that does work is this lousy horn.

19
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,550
Go to hell!
I'm not honking at you!

20
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,960
Jesus Christ!

21
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,450
Hey Scotty!
What's this place like anyway?

22
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,250
Well, the guy that's renting it
says it's an old place.

23
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:37,250
Little run down,
but it's right up in the mountains.

24
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,850
Yeah, and the best part
is that we get it so cheap.

25
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:41,550
Why are we getting it so cheap?

26
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:44,901
Well, I don't know.
Might be in real bad shape.

27
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,050
You mean, nobody's
seen this place yet?

28
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:50,750
- Well, not yet.
- Well, it might not be that bad.

29
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,750
- No.
- Actually, it might be kind of nice.

30
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,350
- Yeah.
- It's probably a real pit!

31
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,250
I think this is where we get off.

32
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,550
- This is the bridge we're going to cross?
- Jesus Christ! The whole thing's falling apart on us!

33
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,350
Don't let the noise fool you girls,
this thing's solid as a rock.

34
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,450
It's supposed to be
one of these on here.

35
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,450
<i>Join Us!</i>

36
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,780
<i>Join Us!</i>

37
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,040
Dead bodies in the cellar.
Dead bodies in the cellar.

38
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,285
Will you stop it?

39
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,950
I would very much like to make
a toast for all this evening.

40
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,106
Ah, as a Greek friend of mine once said...

41
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,403
He said...

42
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,700
I...

43
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:48,001
Ok, Ok, Ok...

44
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:49,701
Nis, nis...

45
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,360
...Tu, Tu, Tu...
Tu, Ta, Rim.

46
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,950
Which means?

47
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:57,750
Party down!
Yeah!

48
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,350
What is this?

49
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,850
Whatever it is,
it's still down there.

50
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,150
I don't like cellars.
Let's just close it up.

51
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,850
It's probably just some animal.

52
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,712
An animal?
An animal?

53
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,550
That is the stupidest thing I
ever heard of. Jesus Christ!

54
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,250
There's something down there.

55
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,450
Maybe it is just some animal.

56
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,150
Yeah, you're probably right.
Probably just some animal.

57
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,850
Cheryl, why don't you go down
and check, make sure?

58
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,750
Scotty!
I'm not going down there!

59
00:10:57,355 --> 00:11:00,050
Ok, Ok you cowards.
I'll go.

60
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,051
Be careful.

61
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Back in a minute.

62
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,050
Hey Scotty!
You find anything?

63
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,150
Scotty!

64
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,250
Scotty?!

65
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,850
Scott!

66
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,350
He's just kidding around...

67
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:00,840
- Isn't he?
- Scotty!!

68
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,660
Scott!

69
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:05,750
Linda, get me a flashlight.

70
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:07,550
That's the only
one we brought up.

71
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:08,450
Then get the lantern.

72
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:29,255
Scotty?!

73
00:14:45,073 --> 00:14:46,247
Boo!!

74
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,550
Hey! Come here,
I wanna show you something.

75
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,250
Look at all this stuff.

76
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,750
I bet this still shoots.

77
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:09,250
Probably does.

78
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,476
Oh!...God!

79
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,550
Oh God!

80
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,250
Look at this!

81
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:42,850
Look at this!

82
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,433
This kind of looks like
your old girlfriend.

83
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:03,950
Come on. Let's take this stuff upstairs.
I'll grab the recorder...

84
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:05,650
...and you get everything else now.

85
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,450
This guy was a real turd...
everybody hated him...

86
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,750
Like...Like you, kind of.

87
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,962
Yeah, just like me.
I'm gonna break your face.

88
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:31,150
...also invented this western stuff
He makes all this little models...

89
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:38,850
Ok, shush! Listen to this...
This is the tape I found downstairs.

90
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:47,250
<i>It has been a number of years since I began excavating
the ruins of Candar with a group of my colleges.</i>

91
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:52,950
<i>Now, my wife and I have retreated to a small cabin
in the solitude of these mountains.</i>

92
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:56,520
<i>Here I continued my research
undisturbed by the myriad</i>

93
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,350
<i>...distractions of modern civilization
and far from the groves of academe.</i>

94
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:07,250
<i>I believe I have made a significant find
in the Candarian Ruins.</i>

95
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:12,750
<i>A Volume of Ancient Sumarian burial practices
and funerary incantations.</i>

96
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:15,950
<i>It is entitled "Naturon Demonto"</i>

97
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:19,050
<i>...roughly translated,
"Book of the Dead".</i>

98
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:21,350
<i>The book is bound in human flesh...</i>

99
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:23,710
<i>...and inked in human blood.</i>

100
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,750
<i>It deals with demons and
demon resurrection and those forces</i>

101
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,950
<i>...which roam the forest and
dark bowers of man's domain.</i>

102
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,750
<i>The first few pages warn that
these enduring creatures may lie...</i>

103
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:43,520
<i>...dormant but are never truly dead.
They may be recalled to active life</i>

104
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,219
<i>...through the incantations
presented in this book.</i>

105
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:49,050
<i>It is through recitation
of these passages...</i>

106
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,750
<i>...that the demons are given license
to possess the living.</i>

107
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,950
What did you do that for?
It was just getting good!

108
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,308
I just don't want to hear it
anymore, that's all.

109
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:05,750
Scotty, c'mon.
Leave her alone, man.

110
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,976
Hey, come on...
I just want to hear the rest of it.

111
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,273
No big deal.

112

Kanda!

116
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,350
Shut it off!

117
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:34,978
Kanda!

118
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,597
Shut it off!!

119
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,950
Kanda!

120
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,750
Shut it off!!!

121
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:43,551
Oh my God!

122
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,050
Cheryl! Where're you going?

123
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:51,750
I can't believe this!

124
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:56,250
Scott, you knew not to play that!
I mean c'mon, you knew it was upsetting her.

125
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:58,550
You just don't know when you're
taking something too far.

126
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,850
Don't give me that!
You were playing it too.
You could've shut it off.

127
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,650
I mean... big deal!

128
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:05,666
She's nuts!

129
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:08,720
I mean it's just a joke,
c'mon!

130
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,820
Jesus Christ. She acts like she's
three years old or something.

131
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:31,050
Listen. Why don't we stay up
for a while and listen to the storm?

132
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,250
All right, yeah.
Let me check on Cheryl first to see if she's Ok.

133
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,142
Stealing from the blind, eh?

134
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,650
It's for you.

135
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,550
Ash, how sweet of you.

136
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,617
- Would you put it on?
- Oh, Sure.

137
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,050
I was going to give it to you
before we came up here, but...

138
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:19,350
...things got so hectic, this is really
the first chance we've had to be alone.

139
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,750
Take a look.

140
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:34,350
Oh, Ash! It's beautiful!
I really love it. I'll never take it off.

141
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,750
<i>Join Us!</i>

142
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,050
Is anybody out there?

143
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:16,481
I know someone's out there!

144
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,750
I heard you.
I heard you in the cellar.

145
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:07,037
<i>Join Us!</i>

146
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,600
Ashley!

147
00:29:08,535 --> 00:29:09,597
Help!

148
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,105
What the hell happened to you? Cheryl, what's the matter with you?
Did something in the woods do this to you?

149
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:44,500
No! It was the woods themselves! They're alive Ashley!
The trees! They're alive!

150
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,000
Ash. Why don't I take her in the
back room so she can lie down...

151
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:50,300
I'm not lying down!
I want to get out of here.

152
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:53,800
I want to leave this place right now.
Right now, Ashley!

153
00:29:53,805 --> 00:29:54,800
Wait a minute!

154
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,000
I sure as hell am not
leaving any place tonight.

155
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:57,821
- Cheryl.
- Cheryl.

156
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,400
Cheryl, there's nothing out there.
Trees do not attack people.

157
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:03,600
Ashley! Will you drive me into town or not?

158
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:09,100
Right now?! Look, sure, sure, I'll take you
into town, but just listen to what you're saying.

159
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:13,300
I don't care how it sounds.
I wanna get out of this place right now!

160
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,900
Ok, maybe you could stay
somewhere in town tonight.

161
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,600
I know it's not gonna start.
It's not gonna let us leave.

162
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,850
Why are you stopping?

163
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,950
Wait here a minute.

164
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,450
Do you see something?

165
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,450
Where're you going?

166
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,750
Ashley!

167
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,450
Ashley!

168
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,890
It's not going to let us go!
It's not going to let us go!

169
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:18,150
I told you! I told you! It's not going to let us go!
Why won't you listen to me?

170
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:37,950
<i>I know now that my wife has become
host to a Candarian demon.</i>

171
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,350
<i>I fear that the only way to stop
those possessed by the...</i>

172
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:45,250
<i>...spirits of the book is through the act
of...bodily dismemberment.</i>

173
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:50,650
<i>I believe now to avoid this horror,
but for myself, I have seen the dark
shadows moving...</i>

174
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:59,450
<i>...in the woods and I have no doubt
that whatever I have resurrected through
this book is sure to come calling...for me.</i>

175
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,450
Ok, ah, let me think.  Ummm...

176
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,350
It's a seven?

177
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,950
Oh! What suit?

178
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,150
Ahh... diamonds. No wait! Ummm, hearts!

179
00:35:08,158 --> 00:35:13,350
- Oh My! It's seven of hearts! You're right!
- Hey Ash! I guessed the card right!

180
00:35:13,355 --> 00:35:14,950
Yeah... truly amazing, Linda.

181
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,350
I don't know, but I think it's really some
sort of extra sense or something...

182
00:35:18,397 --> 00:35:20,950
- ...you know, like ESP.
- Ok, try this one...

183
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,550
Ok... It's a seven.

184
00:35:22,558 --> 00:35:24,750
- I don't believe it!
- ...of Spades.

185
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,150
Queen of Spades.

186
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,950
Four of Hearts.

187
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,050
Eight of Spades.

188
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:41,250
Two of Spades. Jack of Diamonds.
Jack of Clubs!

189
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:47,238
Why have you disturbed our sleep?
Awakened us...

190
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:54,864
...from our ancient slumber?
You will die! Like the others before you.

191
00:35:55,145 --> 00:35:58,850
One by one we will take you.

192
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,950
What happened to her?

193
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:28,650
Did you see her eyes? Oh Ash, I'm scared.
What's wrong with her?

194
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,850
Cheryl! Stop it!

195
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:46,222
- Oh, Shit!
- Join Us! Join...

196
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,900
Ash. I think we ought to get out of here.

197
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:23,751
Yeah.

198
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,250
We still have a few more hours before morning.

199
00:39:27,258 --> 00:39:30,250
I don't think I can wait that long.

200
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,450
You have to.
We all have to!

201
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:40,050
And then in the morning, we'll get in
the car...and we'll take the bridge. And...

202
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,575
Why does she keep making
those horrible noises?!

203
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:47,001
I don't know!

204
00:39:47,023 --> 00:39:50,050
And what about her eyes?

205
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,896
What about her eyes?

206
00:39:55,050 --> 00:40:00,250
For God's Sake,
What happened to her eyes?!

207
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,750
Everything's going to be all right.

208
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,650
Scotty. I think there's
something out there.

209
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,050
Go to bed, and get some sleep. Ok?

210
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,850
Shelly?

211
00:43:53,050 --> 00:44:00,650
Thank you, I don't know what I would have done
if I had remained on those hot coals...

212
00:44:01,234 --> 00:44:07,129
...burning my pretty flesh. You have
pretty skin.

213
00:44:07,602 --> 00:44:09,350
Give it to us!

214
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,650
Join Us!

215
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,750
Join Us!

216
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:12,750
Hit her!

217
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:15,650
Hit her!

218
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:18,050
Hit it!

219
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:12,650
Scott?

220
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
Yeah?

221
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,950
What is...
What are we going to do?

222
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:25,950
We're going to bury her.

223
00:48:27,097 --> 00:48:29,450
You...can't bury Shelly.

224
00:48:29,529 --> 00:48:32,050
- She's a... she's a friend of ours, isn't she?
- Ash, she's dead.

225
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,150
Shelly's dead.

226
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,650
We gotta bury her now.

227
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:45,312
- Linda's still sleeping. I think once her leg...
- I'm getting out of here.

228
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:48,450
Scott, we can't take Linda
anywhere with a leg like that.

229
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,500
We don't even know if there is
any other way back besides the bridge.

230
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:56,150
Well, maybe there's a hiking trail, or an old
road or some other way around the cliff.

231
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,350
I mean there's gotta be another
way besides the bridge.

232
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:05,450
Listen to me. Linda cannot walk with
a leg like that. She can't even stand up.

233
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:09,452
Well, then we'll leave her here.
Until we can send somebody back.

234
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:13,158
- What are you, crazy?
- Look! I'm getting out!

235
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:18,650
I don't care what happens to her.
She's your girlfriend, you take care of her.

236
00:50:18,658 --> 00:50:20,750
I'm getting the hell out of here.
Right now!

237
00:50:41,857 --> 00:50:44,840
Soon all of you will be like me.

238
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:47,850
And then who will lock you up in the cellar?

239
00:51:40,572 --> 00:51:43,150
Ash! Ash!

240
00:51:43,158 --> 00:51:45,850
- Oh my God!
- Help me!

241
00:51:48,932 --> 00:51:50,620
Help me, Ash.

242
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:03,850
Scotty. You're going to be Ok.
You're going to be just fine. You'll see.

243
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:17,950
Ash. It's not going to let us leave.

244
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:21,950
Cheryl...Cheryl was right.

245
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:24,350
We're all going to die here!

246
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,950
No, we're not going to die.

247
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,450
We're all going to die.
All of us!

248
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:34,250
No, we're not going to die! We're not
going to die! We're gonna get out of here.

249
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:38,550
Now listen to me, Scotty.
Is there a way around the bridge?

250
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:44,850
Scotty! Listen to me, please. For God's sake!
Scott!

251
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:54,300
Ash...Ash, I don't wanna die. You're not going
to leave me are you, Ash? Are you?

252
00:52:54,310 --> 00:53:00,450
I don't wanna die. You're not going
to leave me here are you? Are you, Ash?

253
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:09,150
Scotty! Now c'mon listen to me for God's sake!
Is there a way around the bridge?

254
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:17,841
There's a way. The trail.
But the trees, Ash. They know.

255
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,750
Don't you see, Ash? They're alive!

256
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:34,400
Shut up!

257
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:35,250
Shut up, Linda.

258
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,250
Shut up!

259
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,250
Kill her!

260
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,560
Kill her!

261
00:54:01,562 --> 00:54:05,950
Kill her if you can, loverboy.

262
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,270
God! Forgive me, Linda.

263
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,950
Oh, Ash. Help me, please!

264
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:52,750
Ash. Help me, please...Ash.

265
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:56,150
Oh, Ash. Please, don't let them
take me away again.

266
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:00,609
- Please.
- No, I won't. I won't. I promise.

267
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,550
Ashley. Ashley, help me.

268
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:06,250
Let me out of here.

269
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:10,950
Ashley? Ash, help me.

270
00:55:10,962 --> 00:55:13,879
Let me out of here.
I'm... I'm all right now.

271
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:18,384
I'm all right now, Ashley...
I'm all right.

272
00:55:20,377 --> 00:55:23,050
Unlock this chain and let me out.

273
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:31,450
Cheryl?

274
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,650
Cheryl?

275
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:18,750
I'm all right now, Ashley!
Come unlock the chain and let me out!

276
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,850
I'm all right now.
It's your sister Cheryl.

277
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,750
You bastards!

278
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:35,950
Why are you torturing me like this? Why?!

279
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,820
Shut up!

280
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:53,450
We're going to get you.
We're going to get you.

281
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:59,132
Not another peep.
Time to go to sleep.

282
00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:00,339
We're...

283
00:57:09,073 --> 00:57:10,250
It's Useless!

284
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,750
Useless!

285
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:16,650
In time, it will come for him and
then it will come for you!

286
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,573
Here. Here.

287
00:57:45,538 --> 00:57:50,750
Now, the sun will be up in an hour or so
and we can all get out of here together.

288
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:54,850
You, me, Linda, Shelly.

289
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:00,650
Hmm...Well...Shelly...she...

290
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,550
We'll all be going home together.

291
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,798
Wouldn't you like to be going home?

292
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,050
I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?

293
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:16,950
Scott?

294
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:22,970

Come to me.

298
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:16,748
The door.

299
01:08:39,444 --> 01:08:41,149
The back door.

300
01:08:49,111 --> 01:08:52,550
Shells.
Where did I see that box of shells?

301
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:36,100
<i>We're gonna get you!
We're gonna get you!</i>

302
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:37,452
Shut up, Linda.

303
01:10:37,864 --> 01:10:40,153
- We're all gonna die.
- Shut up.

304
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,154

305
01:10:43,081 --> 01:10:48,570

- ...is through the act of...bodily dismemberment.</i>

306
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:53,450
Hit her. Hit her.
Hit it!

307
01:14:41,623 --> 01:14:45,750
Oh, Come on. Come on.
Why are you torturing me like this?
