2
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,883
They're outside.

3
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:53,954
<i>Alert. Condition: Red.</i>

4
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:55,023
We're losing power

5
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:56,391
in the containment chamber.

6
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:13,166
You hear that?

7
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:14,669
Something's close.

8
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,972
See? This is
what I'm talking about.

9
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:19,339
My heart is pounding.

10
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:20,810
Get down, get down.

11
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:28,385
Cubone.

12
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:33,390
A Cubone?

13
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,694
We're not catching you
a Pokemon, are we?

14
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:40,795
What?

15
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:42,696
Tell me
you didn't plan this, Jack.

16
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:43,799
Jack, tell me

17
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:45,432
- you didn't plan this.
- Are you serious?

18
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,304
How dare you. Okay?
Of course not. Come on.

19
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,607
Okay, maybe.

20
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:53,140
There was a full moon
last night

21
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:54,474
and my mom heard it
crying its eyes out.

22
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:56,077
She thought I was
having a nightmare,

23
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,878
so she brought me
a glass of warm milk.

24
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,214
Dude, I thought you wanted to,
you know, hang out

25
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:01,348
and relive the good old days.

26
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,415
Like when we were kids.

27
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:05,386
I do. But just look at it.

28
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:08,588
That is the perfect Pokemon
for you.

29
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:13,426
Jack, I'm not looking for
a Pokemon. I've told you this.

30
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:15,462
I've thought long and hard
about this, okay?

31
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,831
Water-type
is not right for you.

32
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,565
Neither is Fire-type.
But Cubone is...

33
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:19,634
Lonely.

34
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:21,535
Exactly.

35
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,771
Okay, thank you, Jack.
Thank you for that.

36
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:25,406
Are there any other
emotional truth-bombs

37
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:26,908
you wanna drop on me?

38
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,410
Maybe later. But right now
the truth is in my hands.

39
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:35,749
- Just give me the Ball.
- Yes. Yes!

40
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:39,019
Okay, remember, catching
a Pokemon is not about skill.

41
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:40,088
So you can do this.

42
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,321
Good pep talk.

43
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,225
Okay.
It has to choose you, too.

44
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:46,160
So make it wanna be
your partner.

45
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,562
Hey, Cubone.
What's up, buddy?

46
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:49,430
You know,

47
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:51,499
not everyone can pull off

48
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:54,302
wearing the skull
of their dead relative,

49
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:57,038
but, you know, you sure can.

50
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:01,341
Okay, he didn't like that.

51
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,146
He did not like that.

52
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:06,247
Jack.

53
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:08,848
Throw it!

54
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,018
Throw the Ball.

55
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,819
Like a man.

56
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,227
Uh-oh. Cubone.

57
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,762
Cubone!

58
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:24,966
I did it!

59
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:27,871
Still got it.

60
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:33,773
The light's not green.

61
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:35,209
It still hasn't
turned green yet, Jack.

62
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,776
That's bad, right?

63
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:38,446
Run!

64
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:44,619
- It didn't choose me!
- Run!

65
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,387
- It didn't choose me, Jack!
- I can see that!

66
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,591
I'm not its choice!

67
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:57,297
Cubone!

68
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:58,699
<i>That was
one angry Cubone.</i>

69
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:00,869
<i>He reminded me
a lot of my mom.</i>

70
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:03,069
So, um, I don't know
if this is gonna sound

71
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,504
corny or whatever...

72
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:06,607
Just say it, Jack.
I'm too tired to be angry.

73
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:08,242
I'm worried about you.

74
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,677
This again?

75
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,312
Hey, listen, everyone we know
has left town

76
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:12,646
and now I'm leaving, too.

77
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:13,882
Yeah, but that's okay.

78
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:15,182
You gotta do
what's best for you

79
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:16,249
with the time that you got.

80
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,418
That's what I'm doing.

81
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,454
You know,
I'm crushing it at work.

82
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:21,689
I'm gonna get
a promotion real soon.

83
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:24,658
What's the promotion
for an insurance appraiser?

84
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,961
"Senior insurance appraiser"?

85
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:28,997
No, actually,
that's two steps up

86
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:30,398
above where I'm at right now.

87
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,800
You're gonna make me
throw up.

88
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:33,701
That's not a real thing.

89
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:36,269
Oh, I finally have service.

90
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,504
Wait, five voicemails?

91
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:39,439
Why would I have
five voicemails?

92
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,644
Maybe it's an insurance
emergency.

93
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:46,583
Who is it?

94
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:53,290
Um, it's the Ryme City
Police Department.

95
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,825
There was an accident.

96
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,055
Please don't.

97
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,725
Mmm.

98
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:33,860
I actually meant, "Please do".
Thank you.

99
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:36,867
Thank you. You have
a very generous tongue.

100
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,372
Does this Lickitung
belong to anyone?

101
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:45,038
Anybody? No?

102
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,906
<i>Thank you
for travelling with us.</i>

103
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:49,809
<i>Please sit back and watch this
short informational video</i>

104
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:52,579
<i>welcoming you to Ryme City.</i>

105
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:54,014
<i>Throughout history,</i>

106
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,249
<i>Pokemon have been
part of our world.</i>

107
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:57,718
<i>Squirtle.</i>

108
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,252
<i>Early humans
used to catch them</i>

109
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:02,490
<i>and train them to use
their unique powers</i>

110
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:05,093
<i>for the common good.</i>

111
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:06,694
<i>This relationship evolved</i>

112
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:10,434
<i>into what we now refer
to as Pokemon battles.</i>

113
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,536
<i>One man changed all of this.</i>

114
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,038
<i>Howard Clifford,</i>

115
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,908
<i>founder and chairman
of Clifford Industries.</i>

116
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,879
<i>Diagnosed with
a rare degenerative disease,</i>

117
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:26,747
<i>he resigned from
his corporation</i>

118
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:29,283
<i>and searched the world
for a cure.</i>

119
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:32,920
<i>And it turned out
that the cure I was looking for</i>

120
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:36,557
<i>was for me to evolve into
a better version of myself.</i>

121
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,991
<i>And I discovered
how to do that</i>

122
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:39,726
<i>through a partnership
with Pokemon.</i>

123
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,898
<i>And he wanted to share
that discovery with the world.</i>

124
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,466
<i>This is what inspired</i>

125
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:47,402
<i>Howard Clifford
to build Ryme City,</i>

126
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:52,239
<i>a place where humans and
Pokemon can live side by side.</i>

127
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:56,143
<i>Unlike other regions,
where Pokemon live in the wild,</i>

128
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:59,246
<i>here, we live
and work together.</i>

129
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:03,717
<i>No battles. No Trainers.
No Poke Balls.</i>

130
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:07,688
<i>A stronger,
more harmonious world.</i>

131
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,628
<i>From all our citizens:
Welcome to Ryme City.</i>

132
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,866
Char! Charmander!

133
00:10:04,113 --> 00:10:06,212
<i>Fighting fires
wouldn't be the same</i>

134
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:08,081
<i>without their
Squirtle partners.</i>

135
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,688
<i>Squirtle, Squirtle.
Squirtle, Squirtle.</i>

136
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:37,577
Snubbull.

137
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:44,751
Hi, Tim.

138
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:46,122
Lieutenant Yoshida.

139
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:51,424
Your dad was the best
of the best.

140
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:54,596
He was a legend
in this precinct.

141
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:58,231
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that.

142
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:02,503
It was a terrible tragedy,
losing him and his partner.

143
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:03,705
His partner?

144
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:05,272
His Pokemon.

145
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:06,407
Oh, I didn't...

146
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:08,775
Snubbull.

147
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:10,610
I'm sorry,
is yours mad at me?

148
00:11:10,612 --> 00:11:12,712
- Snubbull?
- Yeah.

149
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,414
He may look grumpy
on the outside,

150
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,851
but I assure you,
he is adorable on the inside.

151
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:21,855
If you don't mind me asking,

152
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:24,624
how come you don't have
a Pokemon?

153
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:27,061
I thought I remember
Harry saying

154
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:29,831
you wanted to be a Pokemon
Trainer when you were young.

155
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,166
Yeah, that didn't really
work out.

156
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:35,503
Uh, I work
in insurance now, so...

157
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,040
I understand.

158
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,673
But, Tim,

159
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:41,874
please don't put this
all on yourself.

160
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:44,879
No one should go through
this type of thing alone.

161
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:47,347
If you are anything
like your dad...

162
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:48,617
I'm not.

163
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,019
I was just really
raised by my grandmother.

164
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:53,653
Do you have the spare keys
for his apartment?

165
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,621
I should go wrap things
up there.

166
00:11:55,623 --> 00:11:57,126
Of course.

167
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:58,828
Of course.

168
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:02,797
- Here's his address.
- Awesome.

169
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,331
I can take you over
if you want.

170
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:08,572
No. Nope. I'm all good.
Thank you so much.

171
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,076
Tim.

172
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:18,144
This job,

173
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:20,480
it demands a lot.

174
00:12:20,482 --> 00:12:22,982
But you were on his mind
every day.

175
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:26,789
He loved you more than
anything else in the world.

176
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:35,962
Uh, it was nice to meet you,
Lieutenant.

177
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,826
Excuse me.

178
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:41,064
Okay.

179
00:13:54,843 --> 00:13:56,342
Psyduck!

180
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:57,346
Psyduck.

181
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,082
Are you trying to rob me,
or just annoy me?

182
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:03,953
- Psyduck.
- He's with me.

183
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,989
- We need to talk.
- We do?

184
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:10,157
I've been waiting to see

185
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,892
who would open up
that mailbox.

186
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:15,328
You just walked into
quite a story.

187
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,099
Stories like this spread fear.
And they're afraid of fear.

188
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:20,435
But I don't fear fear.

189
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:21,936
I walk the walk
and I talk the talk.

190
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:23,403
And I'm willing to do
whatever it takes

191
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,076
to get the honest scoop,
and that's the hard truth.

192
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:31,711
I'm sorry. Who are you?

193
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:34,749
Lucy Stevens.
Reporter for CNM.

194
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,821
Oh. You seem kinda young
for that.

195
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,053
I work for the CNM blog,

196
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:41,654
making Pokemon listicles
all day, okay?

197
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:43,923
- Top 10 Cutest Pokemon.
- Yeah, my grandma loves those.

198
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,658
Yeah, news flash:
they're all cute.

199
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,894
Such a waste of time

200
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:48,361
for someone with
my nose for a story.

201
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:50,898
Oh, no, no, not now, Psyduck.

202
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,299
I'm working a source.
Just one more minute.

203
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:54,501
Okay, I'm gonna...

204
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:56,336
I'm gonna need you to go
on record and tell me

205
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,875
everything you know
about Harry Goodman.

206
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:01,975
Wait, what?

207
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:04,845
Harry was onto something big.
Real big.

208
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:06,246
And then all of a sudden,

209
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:08,349
his car crashes over a bridge.
I think not.

210
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:10,283
Something's rotten, and I'm
gonna get to the bottom of it.

211
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,186
Hey, look,
I barely know the guy.

212
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:14,120
- I haven't seen him in years.
- Where's your Pokemon partner?

213
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,691
I don't have one. Why does
everyone keep asking me that?

214
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:17,924
Loner.
Probably hiding something.

215
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:19,427
Okay. I'm gonna go.

216
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:20,995
Hey.

217
00:15:20,997 --> 00:15:22,763
I may only be
an unpaid intern,

218
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:24,630
but I can smell a story.

219
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,299
And I'm going to find it.

220
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,970
Okay. You do that.

221
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:33,407
Come on, Psyduck.
Let's go.

222
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:34,477
Psyduck.

223
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,826
<i>Who is it?</i>

224
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:53,192
Hello?

225
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:55,931
<i>It's me. Snakes.
I got the stuff.</i>

226
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:58,331
<i>Leave it
on the doorstep</i>

227
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,067
<i>and get the hell out of here.</i>

228
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:02,872
<i>All right, Johnny,
but what about my money?</i>

229
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:06,342
Still with the old
detective movies.

230
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:57,227
What?

231
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,897
What? What is that stuff?

232
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:32,459
"Dear Tim. I could do better
if you give me a chance.

233
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:35,530
I'll always have a place
for you to stay."

234
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:38,899
<i>The train on platform...</i>

235
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:41,134
Your father will
pick you up from the station.

236
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:43,104
I'm not going.

237
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:44,738
- What?
- I don't wanna go.

238
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,443
<i>This is home. I wanna stay
here with you, Grandma.</i>

239
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:11,367
Oh, man.

240
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:15,903
<i>This is the most
important day of my life.</i>

241
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,470
I know, Tim.

242
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,907
But your mother had to see
the doctor. It couldn't wait.

243
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:31,187
Harry.

244
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:49,505
Someone there?

245
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:54,444
Hello?

246
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:04,951
Oh.

247
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:06,455
Ahh! That's a sprain.

248
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:14,530
Okay, okay, okay.

249
00:19:16,632 --> 00:19:18,134
Whoever you are,

250
00:19:19,268 --> 00:19:21,437
I know how to use this.

251
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:30,845
It's a Pikachu?

252
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:32,078
Aw, jeez.

253
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,516
Hey, little guy,
how did you get in here?

254
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:39,419
I know you can't
understand me,

255
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:41,320
but put down the stapler,

256
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:46,228
or I will electrocute you.

257
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:50,297
Did you just talk?

258
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,532
Whoa.
Did you just understand me?

259
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:54,234
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

260
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,269
That is heavy eye contact
right there. You heard me.

261
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:57,570
- No, no, no.
- Yes, you did.

262
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,306
- Oh, my God. This is amazing!
- Stop!

263
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:00,906
- You can understand me.
- Stop talking. Stop!

264
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,409
I have been so lonely.

265
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:04,743
- I'm gonna throw up.
- No, kid. I need your help.

266
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,713
- I'm gonna throw up.
- I'm in serious trouble.

267
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:08,682
I need you to listen.

268
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:10,550
- No, no, no, no.
- Excuse me, Aipom,

269
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:12,152
we're having a private
conversation here, please.

270
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:13,519
Stop talking.

271
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:15,021
- You're a hallucination!
- You're a hallucination!

272
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:17,290
And, you! Out! Shoo! Go!

273
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:18,826
I'd tread lightly there,
chief.

274
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:20,760
That Aipom don't look right.

275
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,028
Ahh!

276
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,329
No! Hey! Hey!

277
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:24,998
Get off him, whack-job.

278
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,201
Get up, kid.
He's coming back around.

279
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:30,503
Okay, here's what
you wanna do.

280
00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:32,605
Okay, you wanna bite him.
You wanna scream.

281
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,941
We're playing charades.
We're not playing charades.

282
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,742
- Okay, I'm gonna get a knife.
- Not the knife!

283
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:39,579
Okay, bad idea with the knife.
I'll find something else.

284
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:41,315
Eat this!

285
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:44,317
You are so welcome. He was
just a hungry little guy...

286
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,320
Oh, my God!

287
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:49,722
Come on, kid. Let's move.

288
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:54,394
To the roof!

289
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:07,673
Brilliant idea!
You hold the door.

290
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:09,242
- I'll go get help.
- What?

291
00:21:09,244 --> 00:21:12,380
Help! Help! Oh, my God! Help!

292
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:17,886
Oh, sh...

293
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:21,954
Help! Help! Oh, my God, help!

294
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:26,759
Oh, he's being eaten alive!
He's being eaten alive!

295
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:28,528
A man is dying!

296
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,473
No one's coming.
People are so insensitive.

297
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:42,342
Uh-oh. Put your pants back on

298
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,779
and run like the wind.

299
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,250
Blazing speed! Blazing speed!

300
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:53,988
No, they seem to be attracted
to your increasing nudeness.

301
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,755
Okay.

302
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:57,557
All right,
we're jumping down here.

303
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,425
No! No! I'm not going in
the trash chute.

304
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:01,361
Good call.
Let me know how it goes

305
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,130
with the super crazy Pokemon.

306
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:04,463
You died a hero.

307
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:13,972
Way to stick the landing, kid.

308
00:22:13,974 --> 00:22:15,241
Leave me alone!

309
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:20,314
Oh. Looks like someone's back
in a good mood.

310
00:22:20,316 --> 00:22:23,450
Run! Rabid Aipom!

311
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:25,385
Look out! Run!

312
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:29,222
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
They're... Go! They...

313
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:33,762
I think pants are gonna do you
a lot of good right now.

314
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:37,998
Shoo! Go.

315
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
You know, I pictured you

316
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:41,134
as a bit of a briefs guy,
but those are nice.

317
00:22:41,136 --> 00:22:44,770
Me? I don't wear underwear,
you know? I'm not modest.

318
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:46,506
Excuse me, excuse me, hi.
Sorry.

319
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:48,208
Uh, you can hear him, right?
You can hear him talking?

320
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,310
- Pika-Pika. Pika. Pikachu.
- Aw.

321
00:22:50,312 --> 00:22:53,447
Yeah. Pika-Pika. Pika.
He's adorable.

322
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:55,481
You're adorable.
They can't understand me, kid.

323
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:59,118
It's me. It's that stuff
that I put up my nose.

324
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,753
Not like that.
No, it was a gas.

325
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,288
- I was breathing gas.
- Hey, hey, hey.

326
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,455
Accidentally.
I was accidentally...

327
00:23:03,457 --> 00:23:05,525
Ix-nay on the gas-ay.

328
00:23:05,527 --> 00:23:06,893
Unless you want Johnny Law
to give you

329
00:23:06,895 --> 00:23:08,193
a one-way ticket
to the hoosegow, let's move.

330
00:23:08,195 --> 00:23:09,394
No one else can hear him?

331
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:10,497
This is a first for me,
too, kid.

332
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:11,798
He's saying words.

333
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,066
Try to talk to people
all the time.

334
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:14,034
All they hear is "Pika-Pika".

335
00:23:14,036 --> 00:23:15,336
They pat me or kiss me,

336
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:17,036
stick a finger in me.
It's really gross.

337
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:18,605
Can no one else hear him?

338
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,507
Can you hear him talking?
Do you hear him saying words?

339
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:22,375
What are you not
getting here, kid?

340
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:23,876
You're the only one
who can hear me.

341
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:25,878
- It's like destiny.
- It's not destiny.

342
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,580
Then why were you
in that apartment?

343
00:23:27,582 --> 00:23:29,949
It's my father's place.
That's why I was there.

344
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,622
- Why were you there?
- You're Harry's son?

345
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:37,927
How do you know his name?

346
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:48,303
You're Harry's
Pokemon partner?

347
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:51,007
You want a coffee?

348
00:23:52,574 --> 00:23:54,507
'Cause I could use a coffee.
I mean...

349
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:56,809
Yeah. Let's get a coffee.

350
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,680
Yeah. Come on.

351
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,826
<i>So there
I was in the middle of nowhere</i>

352
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:16,297
<i>with a bad case
of the forgetsies.</i>

353
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:18,097
The only clue to my past
is Harry's name

354
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:20,099
and address inside this hat.

355
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:21,734
So I made my way
to the apartment

356
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:23,368
and that's when I found you.

357
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,105
<i>♪ Jigglypuff ♪</i>

358
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:27,574
I don't know.
Maybe Harry got in too deep.

359
00:24:27,576 --> 00:24:28,875
Deep in what?

360
00:24:28,877 --> 00:24:30,542
You know, mixed up
with the wrong crowd,

361
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:33,012
that kinda thing.
Happens to the best of us.

362
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,547
The debts pile up.
The walls close in.

363
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:38,317
Right becomes wrong.
Wrong becomes wrong.

364
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,819
- Wait, who you calling?
- No one.

365
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:42,721
Yeah, that sounds great.
This menu looks really nice.

366
00:24:42,723 --> 00:24:44,124
Wait, I'm confused.

367
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:45,791
Are you hearing
other voices besides mine?

368
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:47,259
All I wanna know is why
I can understand you.

369
00:24:47,261 --> 00:24:48,894
Ho! Can't help you there, kid.

370
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,498
Like I said, I have amnesia.
Can't remember a darn thing.

371
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,901
Okay, so you're
a talking Pikachu

372
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:55,868
with no memories,
who's addicted to caffeine.

373
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,204
I could stop whenever I want.
These are just choices.

374
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,672
Another round. Extra shot.

375
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:02,041
Black as night.
Thank you, sweetie.

376
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,477
Ludicolo!

377
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,978
Look,
I'm a great detective.

378
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,680
But I can't solve my own
mystery if I have no memory.

379
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:07,980
Then how do you even know
you're a detective?

380
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:10,584
Well, I can feel that
in my jellies.

381
00:25:10,586 --> 00:25:11,951
What is that? What is that?

382
00:25:11,953 --> 00:25:13,819
It's the jellies.
It's that thing, you know?

383
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:16,690
You feel it when you
really believe in something

384
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:18,692
despite everyone telling you
you're wrong.

385
00:25:18,694 --> 00:25:20,660
Which is why I need
to find Harry.

386
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:22,028
He's the key to my past.

387
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,997
- Ludicolo.
- Thanks, doll.

388
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:27,834
I got some bad news for you
'cause, uh, Harry's dead.

389
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:33,973
What? No. No, no, no.
No, Harry ain't dead.

390
00:25:33,975 --> 00:25:36,777
No, Harry is dead.
You're wrong. I'm sorry.

391
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,478
I saw in the police report
that he's dead.

392
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,913
Just 'cause the cops say
he's dead...

393
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,314
It means that
he's legally dead.

394
00:25:41,316 --> 00:25:43,586
Really? Did they find a body?

395
00:25:44,652 --> 00:25:46,219
Oh, I didn't think so.

396
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:49,388
And, by the way, did that
report also say that I'm dead?

397
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,656
'Cause if I'm still alive
and kicking,

398
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:52,124
that means Harry's
out there, too.

399
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:53,359
Case closed.

400
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:55,362
But still open
until I solve it.

401
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:57,329
Okay, I'll bite. Solve what?

402
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:58,564
Oh, I'm glad
you're gonna bite.

403
00:25:58,566 --> 00:26:00,732
All right. Here it is.

404
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:03,036
Harry faked his own death.

405
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,038
Or somebody else faked
Harry's death.

406
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,875
Or Harry faked
somebody else's death.

407
00:26:09,877 --> 00:26:12,179
That last one
doesn't work at all.

408
00:26:12,181 --> 00:26:14,380
- No, it doesn't.
- The first two are contenders.

409
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:15,781
No, I'm gonna go.
We're done here.

410
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,249
- No, we are not done here.
- This is...

411
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:19,619
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.
Where're you going?

412
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,721
Hold up a sec.
We're gonna need each other.

413
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:24,758
No, we don't. I don't need
a Pokemon. Period. Got it?

414
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,325
Then what about
a world-class detective?

415
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:29,563
Because if you wanna find
your pops, I'm your best bet.

416
00:26:29,565 --> 00:26:30,697
I think
a world-class detective

417
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:32,065
oughta have figured out by now

418
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,334
that I'm not here
to find my father.

419
00:26:34,336 --> 00:26:36,036
I'm here to say goodbye.

420
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:38,871
Hey, hey. There's no one
to say goodbye to.

421
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:41,441
Look, you can talk to humans.
I can talk to Pokemon.

422
00:26:41,443 --> 00:26:43,108
We can talk to each other.

423
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,480
This doesn't happen, kid.
It has to mean something.

424
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,682
There's magic that
brought us together,

425
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:51,820
and that magic is called hope.

426
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:56,625
Hope that
Harry is still alive.

427
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:04,730
Oh, you feel it. You feel it
in your jellies, don't you?

428
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:06,465
There's nothing in my jellies.

429
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:09,571
We're gonna do this.
You and me.

430
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:14,606
I can't belie...

431
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:16,844
I will meet you here
tomorrow morning.

432
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,545
Great.

433
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:20,480
- Where're you going?
- To my apartment.

434
00:27:20,482 --> 00:27:21,582
What do you mean,
"Your apartment"?

435
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:22,848
What?

436
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,183
All right,
you can sleep on the couch.

437
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,053
No, I'm not gonna sleep
on the couch.

438
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:27,653
Well, then
you can sleep on the stove.

439
00:27:27,655 --> 00:27:29,388
Be a dear, would you,
and get the door for me.

440
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,656
What am I doing?

441
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:31,557
I just invited

442
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,026
someone to my apartment.

443
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:35,798
I never do this.
I'm not that kind of Pokemon.

444
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:41,434
Dust everywhere.

445
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:43,004
No fingerprints.

446
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,904
Ugh. Doesn't add up.

447
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:47,540
What is going on in here?

448
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,442
I'm searching the joint,
looking for clues.

449
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:50,876
- Is this your room?
- No.

450
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,578
Does Harry have
other children?

451
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,248
No.

452
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,082
He wanted me to live here
when I was a kid,

453
00:27:56,084 --> 00:27:58,484
so he made it look like
my childhood room.

454
00:27:58,486 --> 00:27:59,853
Should we talk about the fact

455
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:01,855
that your childhood bed
is a Pikachu bed?

456
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:02,922
It's a coincidence.

457
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:04,524
I'm sorry. Can you speak up?

458
00:28:04,526 --> 00:28:05,959
I can't hear you.

459
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:07,192
I've never been so flattered

460
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:08,828
and creeped out
at the same time.

461
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,596
Are you gonna make me
into a lampshade?

462
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:11,698
Oh, I might.

463
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,165
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

464
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,201
All these Pokemon cards
and the battle posters...

465
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:17,636
There's a connection,
isn't there?

466
00:28:17,638 --> 00:28:20,405
- You love Pokemon.
- No.

467
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,641
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

468
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:23,041
That was a long time ago,

469
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:24,711
before my father
moved to the city

470
00:28:24,713 --> 00:28:26,712
and spent more time with
Pokemon than his own son.

471
00:28:26,714 --> 00:28:28,615
Mmm, yeah,
blame it on your dad.

472
00:28:28,617 --> 00:28:30,116
Okay, look, what about this?

473
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:31,951
There's pictures of her
all over the apartment.

474
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:33,385
She's obviously connected
to Harry.

475
00:28:33,387 --> 00:28:35,188
She might know me.

476
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,556
She could be a lead.

477
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:38,260
No, she's not.

478
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,926
That's my mom.

479
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,895
She passed away when I was 11.

480
00:28:42,897 --> 00:28:46,165
Oh. I'm sorry. I...

481
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:47,770
I didn't realize.

482
00:28:51,306 --> 00:28:53,307
Tomorrow morning
I'm gonna take you to Yoshida

483
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:55,144
so we can get some answers.

484
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:25,838
Ahh, my clues!

485
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,138
What is all this?

486
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,807
Hard work.
That's what this is.

487
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,675
And, by the way,
we can't go to the cops.

488
00:29:30,677 --> 00:29:32,345
Not till we know
who we can trust.

489
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:34,314
So put my clues back in order,
would you?

490
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:36,281
These aren't clues. This is
the work of a serial killer.

491
00:29:36,283 --> 00:29:37,182
They're almost clues.

492
00:29:37,184 --> 00:29:38,684
What does that even mean?

493
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:40,153
Trying to jog my memory,
retrace my steps.

494
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,255
It helps me
to see it all laid out.

495
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:43,656
That's how I found this.

496
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:46,759
This is what a Frenchman
would call <i>caliente fiesta.</i>

497
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:47,861
Not French.

498
00:29:47,863 --> 00:29:49,060
Smell my finger.

499
00:29:49,062 --> 00:29:51,197
I will never
smell your finger.

500
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:52,298
Coward.

501
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,999
The point is,
I smelled this R stuff

502
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,934
on those Aipom when
they attacked us yesterday.

503
00:29:55,936 --> 00:29:57,470
- R?
- Bingo!

504
00:29:57,472 --> 00:29:59,040
<i>La Cucaracha.</i>

505
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:03,109
See, I'm thinking Harry

506
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:04,778
caught a break in the case,

507
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,378
forcing our shadowy kingpin

508
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,682
to send out hired goons
to deliver the big hush-hush.

509
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:11,116
We need to retrace
Harry's steps.

510
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:12,718
Either solve
the case ourselves

511
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,153
or get far enough
along that this

512
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:16,623
A-number-one bad guy
has to reveal himself.

513
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,624
- Or herself!
- Can you stop doing that?

514
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:20,961
So, what is the way in, huh?

515
00:30:20,963 --> 00:30:22,461
The answer is in this room.

516
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:24,697
This isn't a room.
This is a fire hazard.

517
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:27,936
It's just junk
and papers and...

518
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:31,637
Newspapers.

519
00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:33,105
What you got, kid?

520
00:30:33,107 --> 00:30:34,974
I literally just met someone.

521
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:37,576
She was a... She was
a junior reporter at CNM.

522
00:30:37,578 --> 00:30:39,980
She was doing a story
on Harry.

523
00:30:39,982 --> 00:30:41,913
I think she knows
more than she let on.

524
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:43,950
The smart ones always do.

525
00:30:43,952 --> 00:30:45,852
We gotta go down to her work
and press her.

526
00:30:45,854 --> 00:30:47,086
- Okay.
- That's a metaphor.

527
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:48,888
Yeah, I know
what a metaphor is.

528
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,256
Uh, I was drinking that.

529
00:30:50,258 --> 00:30:51,691
I was also drink...
Just step anywhere.

530
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:53,058
It's only my life's work.

531
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,595
No. No, we're not doing that.

532
00:30:55,597 --> 00:30:57,028
Fine, I'll walk.

533
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,902
I'm trying to get in
100,000 steps this hour.

534
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:04,804
<i>Hello, I'm Roger Clifford,
president of CNM</i>

535
00:31:04,806 --> 00:31:06,572
and chairman
of Clifford Enterprises.

536
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,040
And I'm Howard Clifford,

537
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:10,242
the visionary icon
behind Ryme City.

538
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,345
Together,
in the spirit of harmony,

539
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:14,113
we're throwing
the largest parade

540
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:15,981
that Ryme City has ever seen.

541
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:17,549
You won't wanna miss it.

542
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:19,786
So, at the weekend,
we invite the people...

543
00:31:19,788 --> 00:31:21,421
And the Pokemon
to be there.

544
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:23,088
A celebration
of the harmony

545
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,291
between humans and Pokemon.

546
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:28,729
And, cut!

547
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:30,230
Well, I think
that went rather well.

548
00:31:30,232 --> 00:31:31,463
Oh, shut up, Dad!

549
00:31:31,465 --> 00:31:32,833
He seems nice.

550
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:34,633
Roger, please.
This is supposed to be

551
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,501
our gift to the citizens.

552
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:38,637
"Visionary icon"? Really?

553
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:40,640
Was "savior of
the world" taken?

554
00:31:40,642 --> 00:31:43,175
It was your people who wrote
the promo, son.

555
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:45,009
Oh, is there
an unabridged version

556
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:47,113
where you cure cancer?

557
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,480
Oh, that's right, yeah.

558
00:31:48,482 --> 00:31:50,415
Turn your back on me
like you always did.

559
00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:51,483
Ditto!

560
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:53,419
By the way, no one
likes your Pokemon!

561
00:31:53,421 --> 00:31:54,488
There she is.

562
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,589
I can see
why you were so excited.

563
00:31:57,591 --> 00:32:00,259
I was... Okay,
I was not that excited.

564
00:32:00,261 --> 00:32:01,862
Mr. Clifford!
Mr. Clifford!

565
00:32:01,864 --> 00:32:04,463
Mr. Clifford,
I may have a story for you.

566
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:07,032
I've heard rumors
of Pokemon attacking people.

567
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:08,500
But there's been
no mainstream coverage.

568
00:32:08,502 --> 00:32:10,403
I'm sorry,
we're not a tabloid.

569
00:32:10,405 --> 00:32:12,271
Which means
that we don't report

570
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:15,407
on rumors, gossip or hearsay.

571
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:18,310
It's not news
if it can't be verified.

572
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:22,382
You want a story,
find a source.

573
00:32:22,384 --> 00:32:24,319
Oh, and pro tip:

574
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:27,990
A reasonable sense of fashion.

575
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,432
Here she comes.

576
00:32:40,434 --> 00:32:41,800
Here she comes.
Try to look deep.

577
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:43,568
What are you doing here?

578
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,938
Hey, again. Uh...

579
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,372
Yeah, I know this seems weird

580
00:32:46,374 --> 00:32:48,575
but I actually needed
to ask you something.

581
00:32:48,577 --> 00:32:50,576
Now's not really a good time.

582
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:54,145
Yeah, I saw that. I'm sorry.

583
00:32:58,752 --> 00:33:01,153
Sorry. It's piping hot.

584
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:03,990
You found yourself
a Pokemon partner.

585
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:05,590
- Not exactly, no.
- Aw.

586
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,192
He's cute.

587
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,128
She's trying to work me, kid.
But, trust me, I can...

588
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,031
Oh, sweet Mother of Arceus,
that feels so good.

589
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,400
- So, listen...
- Oh, my God.

590
00:33:14,402 --> 00:33:15,500
What happened?

591
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:17,336
I found something
in Harry's desk,

592
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:19,538
nearly choked me to death,
and I was...

593
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,541
No, not here.

594
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:25,144
In my office.

595
00:33:25,146 --> 00:33:27,814
In her office?
We're going to her office?

596
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:31,584
This is great.

597
00:33:31,586 --> 00:33:34,854
This isn't an office.
It's a coffin with pencils.

598
00:33:34,856 --> 00:33:36,256
Psyduck?

599
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:37,490
Yeah, that's right.
I can talk to the kid,

600
00:33:37,492 --> 00:33:39,025
he can talk to me.
We're gifted.

601
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:40,993
You didn't tell me
that she has a Psyduck.

602
00:33:40,995 --> 00:33:43,528
These things explode
when they're stressed.

603
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,030
Hey. Hey, keep calm, pal.

604
00:33:45,032 --> 00:33:47,468
Serenity now. Serenity now.

605
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:50,005
- No.
- Okay.

606
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:51,804
Okay.

607
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:53,575
- You got it?
- Here it is.

608
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:58,778
Where did you find these?

609
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,113
Word on the street was that

610
00:34:00,115 --> 00:34:01,881
Harry had an informant
near the docks.

611
00:34:01,883 --> 00:34:03,348
I went there to snoop around,

612
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,518
and that's where
I found the vial.

613
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,186
But the docks
can be dangerous.

614
00:34:08,188 --> 00:34:09,387
It's not the sort of place

615
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,023
you want to visit alone
at night.

616
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:14,428
I'm actually pretty good
at being alone at night.

617
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:19,097
Nope, that did not land right
at all.

618
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:23,001
That's not... That's not
what I meant to say. Um...

619
00:34:23,003 --> 00:34:24,936
- It's okay.
- I'm just gonna...

620
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,505
We should go.

621
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:28,775
- Yeah, we should go.
- I'm just gonna scoot by ya.

622
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,376
Good God, have you ever talked
to a woman before?

623
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:33,545
- You've got some...
- Psyduck.

624
00:34:33,547 --> 00:34:35,581
Yes, I've talked women before.
No, I don't need your help.

625
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,884
Was it during
the birth canal, or...

626
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,222
You know what you need?

627
00:34:44,224 --> 00:34:45,925
A shoulder saddle.
I bet someone makes one.

628
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:47,726
Okay. There are other
ways for you to get around.

629
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:49,329
This is humiliating.

630
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:50,630
Every step
for you is 1000 for me,

631
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:51,998
and my lungs
are the size of grapes.

632
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,266
We need to get
some ground rules

633
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:54,300
if this partnership's
gonna work.

634
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:55,867
You're not my partner.

635
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:57,103
Mentor, <i>sensei,</i> master,

636
00:34:57,105 --> 00:34:58,103
whatever you wanna call it.

637
00:34:58,105 --> 00:34:59,672
Nope, none of those.

638
00:34:59,674 --> 00:35:01,440
Hey, what if it wasn't the
gas? What if it's hereditary?

639
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:03,809
What if Harry could understand
your annoying voice, too?

640
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:06,179
You don't need to talk to us
for us to understand.

641
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:07,947
We can feel
what you're saying.

642
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:10,983
You have to be open to the
experience. Try it sometime.

643
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,318
Yeah, I'd rather not.

644
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,818
I got my plate full
talking to you.

645
00:35:14,922 --> 00:35:16,155
What is that?

646
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,556
Silent but deadly.

647
00:35:17,558 --> 00:35:19,425
Apologies, my tummy's bad
from all the coffee.

648
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:20,962
No. Ew. Get off.

649
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,329
I meant that.

650
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:25,398
Oh. Ooh. Ugh.

651
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,465
That.

652
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:29,268
It's a Mr. Mime.
They're the worst.

653
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,338
Silent but annoying.

654
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,873
Does he recognize you?
I think he recognizes you.

655
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,744
Well, I was Harry's partner,
so I would've been with him.

656
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,114
Harry's informant
is a Pokemon!

657
00:35:41,116 --> 00:35:42,317
Get him!

658
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:50,489
- He's barely moving.
- Don't tell him that.

659
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:51,992
Oh! He's on a bike.

660
00:35:51,994 --> 00:35:53,226
Come on! He thinks
he's getting away.

661
00:35:53,228 --> 00:35:54,561
Look, quick!
Get in front of him.

662
00:35:54,563 --> 00:35:56,528
- Cut him off. You can make it.
- Stop.

663
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,264
Oh, no.

664
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:01,634
He's going down hard, Tim.

665
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:03,668
Should've worn a helmet.

666
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,871
I hope he makes it.

667
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:07,306
Come on. This is ridiculous.

668
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:08,673
I'm good cop, you're bad cop.

669
00:36:08,675 --> 00:36:09,742
We're not cops.

670
00:36:09,744 --> 00:36:11,244
Grow some berries.

671
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:12,344
You're bigger and tougher
looking than I am.

672
00:36:12,346 --> 00:36:13,913
Stand up straight!

673
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:15,248
Listen up.

674
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,849
We got ways to make you talk.
Or mime.

675
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:18,384
Yeah.

676
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:19,385
So tell us
what we wanna know.

677
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:20,719
Why was Harry Goodman here

678
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,556
and what did it have to do
with the R?

679
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:26,025
Pipe. Yes, okay. A can!

680
00:36:26,027 --> 00:36:27,559
Shoving. Pushing.

681
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,960
My problem is that
I push people away

682
00:36:28,962 --> 00:36:30,528
and then hate them
for leaving.

683
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,565
- He's saying you can shove it.
- What? I can shove it?

684
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:34,166
Okay, that's it.
We're switching roles.

685
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:35,467
I'm bad cop, you're good cop.

686
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:37,101
- No, no, no, we're not cops!
- Oh!

687
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:38,637
Oh, God,
that's a very hard wall.

688
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:40,306
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Mr. Mime has the ability

689
00:36:40,308 --> 00:36:42,474
to make invisible walls.

690
00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:45,143
Uh, yes, I know. I happen to
be a Pokemon, too, remember?

691
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:48,780
Look, Harry figured this guy
out somehow.

692
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:51,619
I think the trick is
getting inside his head.

693
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:54,189
I have an idea.

694
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,222
What are you doing?

695
00:36:58,425 --> 00:36:59,692
Oh, what's this?

696
00:36:59,694 --> 00:37:01,226
Oh, there's a door there.
I didn't...

697
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:02,594
Probably because
it's invisible.

698
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,364
Huh? Yeah! I'm in your space
now, am I right?

699
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:07,666
You don't like this so much,
do you?

700
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:09,601
What are you doing?

701
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,804
That's a jug.
No, you're pouring.

702
00:37:11,806 --> 00:37:13,139
No.

703
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:14,507
Salt. It's a salt shaker.
You're cooking.

704
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:15,809
- No.
- Real cooking is about

705
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:17,043
following your heart,
not a recipe!

706
00:37:17,045 --> 00:37:18,443
What are you talking about?

707
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,646
Gas. You're pouring
gasoline on...

708
00:37:20,648 --> 00:37:23,481
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, that went dark fast.

709
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:25,885
I like this.
I like this very much.

710
00:37:27,755 --> 00:37:29,088
All right, all right.

711
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:32,490
Okay. You wanna
play that game?

712
00:37:32,492 --> 00:37:34,226
I can play that game.

713
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:38,431
You think that's funny?

714
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:40,266
You think that's funny, huh?

715
00:37:40,268 --> 00:37:43,302
You're not gonna be
laughing soon, huh?

716
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:45,737
Who's laughing now, huh?

717
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:48,874
Oh. Oh, I smell what
you're stepping in.

718
00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:50,210
That's right, Mr. Mime.

719
00:37:50,212 --> 00:37:52,344
You're about to be Mr. Melt

720
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:53,882
unless you start talking.

721
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:57,483
Cards, cards. Playing cards.
Poker.

722
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:59,050
No, I think he's talking
about the R.

723
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:01,019
Someone was handing out R.

724
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:02,755
Use your body words. Where?

725
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:05,056
Circle house. Moon house.
Moon. House.

726
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:06,960
Enough with the games.
Say it.

727
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:08,092
Just say it!

728
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:09,829
Talk, you stupid mime!

729
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,666
Okay, just relax.

730
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,800
Uh, round.

731
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:15,001
Round house. Uh...

732
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,170
The source of the R
came from the Roundhouse.

733
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:18,438
Yeah, nice work, kid.
Maybe there's

734
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,371
a little detective
in you after all.

735
00:38:37,092 --> 00:38:41,596
Critical hit!
Additional damage!

736
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:56,208
I didn't know they had
Pokemon battles in Ryme City.

737
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,445
We're not supposed to.

738
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:02,248
Gengar uses Shadow Ball!

739
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,197
Come on.
Let's take a look around.

740
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:22,635
Okay, kid.
So here's what we know.

741
00:39:22,637 --> 00:39:24,704
Harry traces the R to here.

742
00:39:24,706 --> 00:39:26,139
Then frequents this joint
because someone

743
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:27,673
here knows something
about something.

744
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:30,675
We just need to find
the someone and the something.

745
00:39:30,677 --> 00:39:35,248
Hey, hey! Where's that
Pikachu's partner? Don't go.

746
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,315
I think the "someone"
just found us.

747
00:39:37,317 --> 00:39:38,684
Wow. I'd like to see

748
00:39:38,686 --> 00:39:40,085
this guy's Internet
search history.

749
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:41,320
Who are you?

750
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:42,454
Let's see where this goes.

751
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:43,688
Tell him
you're my new partner.

752
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,690
I'm his new partner.

753
00:39:45,692 --> 00:39:47,693
Well, that Pikachu's
Thunderbolt

754
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:49,862
almost wrecked
my prize Charizard

755
00:39:49,864 --> 00:39:52,300
- last time he was here.
- Oh.

756
00:39:53,134 --> 00:39:54,699
Scar is still fresh.

757
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:58,371
All I hear are consonants,
and all I see are nipples.

758
00:39:58,373 --> 00:40:00,438
And you know what?

759
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,907
He ruined my coat, man.
Look at this.

760
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:03,909
I'm so sorry.

761
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:05,677
Forget the coat.
Where's his shirt?

762
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:08,581
This! This is my place!

763
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:11,249
And nobody comes into my place

764
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:13,351
and does that to my Pokemon.

765
00:40:13,353 --> 00:40:14,753
What are you looking at?

766
00:40:14,755 --> 00:40:16,387
Or to my coat.

767
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:18,289
Right, the coat. The coat.

768
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,757
What are you doing?

769
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:21,594
Classic staredown, kid.
First one to blink loses.

770
00:40:21,596 --> 00:40:22,728
Now stop distracting me.

771
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,896
Er, look, I just wanna know

772
00:40:24,898 --> 00:40:26,731
why his old partner was here.
That's all.

773
00:40:26,733 --> 00:40:28,333
Gengar wins.

774
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:32,371
Ready for next battle.

775
00:40:32,373 --> 00:40:34,106
And I want a rematch.

776
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:36,374
You give me my rematch...

777
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:40,415
I'll tell you everything
you want to know. What I know.

778
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:43,985
- Er...
- Tell him he's on, <i>amigo.</i>

779
00:40:44,918 --> 00:40:45,983
Okay.

780
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,119
A new battle's unfolding.

781
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:51,222
Pikachu versus Charizard.

782
00:40:51,224 --> 00:40:52,492
Rematch!

783
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,364
Here. Hold my hat.

784
00:40:58,366 --> 00:40:59,831
I'm about to rock this place.

785
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,867
- Okay.
- Charizard! Charizard!

786
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:03,601
Just doing
some light stretching.

787
00:41:03,603 --> 00:41:05,269
You never wanna
go into these things tight.

788
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:07,206
You're gonna win
this time, okay?

789
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,742
What are you doing?
What is your plan of attack?

790
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:11,577
I don't operate
according to plans, kid.

791
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:13,978
I deal with things
in the moment.

792
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:19,554
Here. Here we go.
Now you'll be ready.

793
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:26,057
Now, obviously, I've dealt
with this putz before,

794
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:27,358
so I'll just do it again.

795
00:41:28,628 --> 00:41:30,161
Give me my hat back!

796
00:41:30,163 --> 00:41:31,364
That thing just chugged

797
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:33,032
a year's worth
of that R stuff!

798
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:35,467
Hey, hey, hey.
It's like you said, okay?

799
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:36,601
You did it before.

800
00:41:36,603 --> 00:41:38,137
You just gotta
use your powers.

801
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:41,106
You can use Quick Attack,
Discharge, or Electro Ball,

802
00:41:41,108 --> 00:41:42,574
but I think Volt Tackle

803
00:41:42,576 --> 00:41:44,076
is your best move,
so start with that.

804
00:41:44,078 --> 00:41:45,543
First of all,

805
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:46,945
when did you learn
how to be a Pokemon Trainer?

806
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:49,014
And secondly, get me
the hell out of here!

807
00:41:49,016 --> 00:41:50,018
Begin!

808
00:41:52,386 --> 00:41:53,853
- Look out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

809
00:41:53,855 --> 00:41:55,554
I forgot everything you said!

810
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,623
I forget things, it's what
I do! I have amnesia!

811
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:59,824
You need to go for a
critical hit. Use Volt Tackle!

812
00:41:59,826 --> 00:42:02,894
Volt Tackle will knock me out.
I'm going for Thunderbolt.

813
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:06,298
Come on.
You got it, you got it!

814
00:42:14,974 --> 00:42:16,809
Come on, come on, come on.

815
00:42:16,811 --> 00:42:18,744
Hey, bud! What are you doing?

816
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:20,813
I can't do it
when people are watching.

817
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:22,882
Can everyone just
look away, please?

818
00:42:22,884 --> 00:42:25,217
It's not working.

819
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:26,952
I forgot how to use my powers.

820
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:30,692
But he didn't!

821
00:42:35,395 --> 00:42:36,561
Pikachu, run!

822
00:42:36,563 --> 00:42:38,163
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

823
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,373
Taken out with one hit!

824
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,340
Aw, Pikachu. Wanna cry?

825
00:42:53,713 --> 00:42:56,614
You don't wanna do this!
I'm adorable.

826
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,185
Pika-Pika?

827
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:10,431
Are you crazy?
Get out of there!

828
00:43:12,532 --> 00:43:13,666
I got it, kid!

829
00:43:24,244 --> 00:43:26,411
What are you doing to my baby?

830
00:43:26,413 --> 00:43:28,380
- Get out of the way!
- Uh-oh.

831
00:43:36,224 --> 00:43:38,657
Uh-oh. That's not good.

832
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:15,059
Tell me what you know!

833
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:16,896
The guy you are looking for

834
00:44:16,898 --> 00:44:19,664
wanted to know
the source of R.

835
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:21,467
It comes from the doctor.

836
00:44:21,469 --> 00:44:22,534
That's all I know.

837
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:23,771
Now let me go!

838
00:44:38,184 --> 00:44:40,020
Nice catch, kid.
Let's get out of here.

839
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,391
I got a plan.

840
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:48,559
What? That's not gonna work.
Magikarp is the worst.

841
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,461
Magikarp can evolve
into Gyarados.

842
00:44:50,463 --> 00:44:51,597
All it needs is a little kick.

843
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:52,867
Water in the hole!

844
00:44:56,237 --> 00:44:58,036
In my head,
I saw that differently.

845
00:44:58,038 --> 00:45:00,641
Er...

846
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,623
Hey, Tim? I don't float.

847
00:45:23,898 --> 00:45:26,934
Ha! I told you
Magikarp weren't useless.

848
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,605
You're under arrest.

849
00:45:32,005 --> 00:45:34,840
I thought you couldn't wait
to get home.

850
00:45:34,842 --> 00:45:37,945
Yeah. Well, my plans changed
because I found him.

851
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:40,045
I'm not following.

852
00:45:40,047 --> 00:45:42,614
Harry's not dead.
If his Pokemon partner

853
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:43,782
is still alive,
that means he is, too.

854
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:45,451
That is not proof, son.

855
00:45:45,453 --> 00:45:46,585
Tell him about the chemical R.

856
00:45:46,587 --> 00:45:47,652
Give me a minute.

857
00:45:47,654 --> 00:45:49,021
Harry's last case

858
00:45:49,023 --> 00:45:50,456
had to do with those
underground battles.

859
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:51,657
That's why I was there.
There's a chemical.

860
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:53,025
We ran an investigation.

861
00:45:53,027 --> 00:45:54,559
Harry figured it out
and he's in trouble.

862
00:45:54,561 --> 00:45:55,760
That case is closed. Over!

863
00:45:55,762 --> 00:45:56,829
You gotta reopen
the investigation!

864
00:45:56,831 --> 00:45:58,163
He's out there, I can feel it.

865
00:45:58,165 --> 00:45:59,431
In your jellies.
Go ahead, say it.

866
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:00,766
I'm not gonna say that.

867
00:46:00,768 --> 00:46:02,902
I can feel it, Lieutenant,
in my bones.

868
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:04,969
- Not as good.
- Stop!

869
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,539
Oh, yeah, and I can
understand Pikachu,

870
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:09,644
like, word perfect, so...

871
00:46:11,244 --> 00:46:12,945
Tim.

872
00:46:12,947 --> 00:46:15,481
It's very difficult
coping with loss.

873
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:16,914
Denial can be
a powerful thing.

874
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:19,550
No, I'm not in denial!
I'm right, I know it!

875
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:21,788
He's... He's out there.

876
00:46:27,695 --> 00:46:29,961
I never wanted
to show you this,

877
00:46:29,963 --> 00:46:32,733
but I think
it's important you see it.

878
00:46:40,273 --> 00:46:43,675
No one could survive
a crash like that.

879
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:45,413
Not even your dad.

880
00:46:48,382 --> 00:46:50,851
He's gone, Tim.

881
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:04,098
I should've
gotten on that train.

882
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:08,669
What's that, kid?

883
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:13,273
After my mom died,

884
00:47:14,474 --> 00:47:16,442
my dad and I drifted apart.

885
00:47:16,444 --> 00:47:17,842
Er...

886
00:47:17,844 --> 00:47:21,715
He moved here and poured
himself into his work.

887
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:25,349
And, eventually,
he tried to get me

888
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:27,020
to come live with him,

889
00:47:27,822 --> 00:47:29,257
but I wouldn't go.

890
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:32,226
How come?

891
00:47:36,797 --> 00:47:38,766
I didn't think he cared.

892
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:47,204
I guess I just got used to him
not being around

893
00:47:47,206 --> 00:47:50,344
and I couldn't forgive him
for it.

894
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,848
Until I got here.

895
00:47:57,585 --> 00:47:59,787
And I realized
that he did care.

896
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:04,956
But I didn't know...

897
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:09,162
because I never
gave him the chance.

898
00:48:10,364 --> 00:48:13,367
And now it's too late.

899
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,406
I really...

900
00:48:21,842 --> 00:48:24,478
I really wish
I'd gotten on that train.

901
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,315
Mmm-hmm.

902
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:33,053
Listen, kid.

903
00:48:33,855 --> 00:48:35,286
Um...

904
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:38,155
Look, I may not have memories,

905
00:48:38,157 --> 00:48:40,862
um, but I know this much:

906
00:48:42,596 --> 00:48:44,098
It wasn't your fault.

907
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:49,035
It wasn't anybody's fault.

908
00:48:51,338 --> 00:48:54,141
And I'm sure that
if your dad was here,

909
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:58,076
he would hug you so hard,

910
00:48:58,078 --> 00:49:00,014
your bones would pop.

911
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:01,880
And he'd tell you

912
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:03,885
he's sorry for everything.

913
00:49:06,286 --> 00:49:08,955
He'd be
damn proud of you, kid.

914
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,092
I haven't been
really nice to you.

915
00:49:15,094 --> 00:49:17,228
No, you really haven't.

916
00:49:21,302 --> 00:49:22,370
Well...

917
00:49:23,536 --> 00:49:25,603
We still got
one mystery to solve.

918
00:49:25,605 --> 00:49:26,905
What?

919
00:49:26,907 --> 00:49:28,208
Yours.

920
00:49:29,543 --> 00:49:32,577
Let's find out
who did this to you.

921
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:33,911
Get your memory back.

922
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:35,415
I'd like that.

923
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,148
I'd like that very much.

924
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,991
Well, that's a bad-guy car.

925
00:50:02,842 --> 00:50:04,275
Thank you, Miss Norman.

926
00:50:04,277 --> 00:50:07,478
Yes. Thank you, Miss Norman.
That'll be all.

927
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,982
What a blabbermouth.

928
00:50:09,683 --> 00:50:12,018
Please, come in.

929
00:50:16,456 --> 00:50:18,791
Magnificent creatures,
aren't they?

930
00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:28,469
Whoa. A Flareon.

931
00:50:30,103 --> 00:50:33,072
Imagine
being able to evolve

932
00:50:33,074 --> 00:50:35,907
into the best possible
version of yourself.

933
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:38,143
Hmm. 'Sup?

934
00:50:38,145 --> 00:50:42,617
That greatness inside you,
just waiting to be awoken.

935
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:47,452
Hello, Tim.

936
00:50:47,454 --> 00:50:48,719
He knows you?

937
00:50:48,721 --> 00:50:51,655
I see you've partnered
with Harry's Pikachu.

938
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:52,990
And he knows me, too.

939
00:50:52,992 --> 00:50:54,893
You knew Harry?

940
00:50:54,895 --> 00:50:57,264
The case Harry was working on,

941
00:50:57,831 --> 00:50:59,130
it was for me.

942
00:50:59,132 --> 00:51:01,498
That's a twist.
That's very twisty.

943
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,637
This compound threatens
everything I've built.

944
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:08,106
He knows about the R.
How does he know about the R?

945
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:10,909
I hired Harry
to trace it to its source.

946
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:13,911
Imagine my shock
when the answer

947
00:51:13,913 --> 00:51:16,316
turned out to be my own son.

948
00:51:18,152 --> 00:51:21,119
I've devoted my life
to perfecting the partnership

949
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:22,786
between Pokemon and humans.

950
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:26,324
A partnership where Pokemon
bring out the best in us.

951
00:51:26,326 --> 00:51:28,594
In doing so,
I'm afraid I neglected

952
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:31,165
my responsibilities
as a parent.

953
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,233
Roger resents the Pokemon.

954
00:51:36,235 --> 00:51:39,405
I think he's lived in
my shadow for so long,

955
00:51:39,407 --> 00:51:42,708
he actually wants
to destroy my legacy.

956
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:43,907
Well, there's no such thing

957
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:45,409
as "daddy issues"
without "daddy".

958
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:47,778
But, Mr. Clifford,
how could you let him do that?

959
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,681
Ever since my illness
put me in this chair,

960
00:51:50,683 --> 00:51:53,885
Roger has taken over more
and more of the company.

961
00:51:53,887 --> 00:51:55,387
He controls the board.

962
00:51:55,389 --> 00:51:58,088
He also controls the police
and the politicians.

963
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:00,190
And he owns the press.

964
00:52:00,192 --> 00:52:03,327
Harry is the only one
I can trust.

965
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,232
That's why
you need to find him.

966
00:52:06,866 --> 00:52:08,599
You haven't heard.

967
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:10,135
Harry's dead.

968
00:52:10,137 --> 00:52:11,639
Oh, no, Tim.

969
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,639
Your father

970
00:52:14,641 --> 00:52:16,109
is alive.

971
00:52:19,246 --> 00:52:20,648
Look out, kid!

972
00:52:24,951 --> 00:52:27,418
Advanced holographic imaging.

973
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,721
Since being confined
to this chair,

974
00:52:29,723 --> 00:52:35,059
I've invested in ways
of bringing the world to me.

975
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:37,362
This was recreated
from police footage.

976
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:40,197
It allows us to see things
that they cannot

977
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,602
or don't want us to see.

978
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:46,040
He's alive.

979
00:52:46,574 --> 00:52:47,706
Pika.

980
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:49,773
It's me. I was with Harry
in the crash.

981
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:50,777
He needs my help.

982
00:52:54,014 --> 00:52:56,083
If Harry's alive,
why didn't they find him?

983
00:53:03,824 --> 00:53:04,956
What is that?

984
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:06,224
Mewtwo.

985
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:08,592
A man-made abomination

986
00:53:08,594 --> 00:53:10,929
created in a laboratory
using DNA

987
00:53:10,931 --> 00:53:14,132
from the fossil remains
of the Ancient Mew.

988
00:53:14,134 --> 00:53:15,768
I can't believe it.

989
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,869
If that thing came from Mew,

990
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:19,170
then we're looking at

991
00:53:19,172 --> 00:53:21,174
the most powerful Pokemon
in the world.

992
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:30,014
That's it.
That's what happened to me.

993
00:53:30,016 --> 00:53:32,916
Mewtwo wiped my memory.

994
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,121
But why?

995
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,560
Wait, wait, wait!

996
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:50,135
Wait. Wait, wait.
Where did it take him?

997
00:53:50,137 --> 00:53:52,503
That's for you to solve now.

998
00:53:52,505 --> 00:53:56,710
Find Mewtwo
and you will find your father.

999
00:54:00,746 --> 00:54:01,846
Second chances

1000
00:54:01,848 --> 00:54:03,414
are special things, kid.

1001
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:05,349
There's a lot we can make
better if we crack this case.

1002
00:54:05,351 --> 00:54:07,219
One question, though.
Where are we going?

1003
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:08,619
I don't know, I'm just going.

1004
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,554
You gotta tell me where.
You're the detective.

1005
00:54:10,556 --> 00:54:13,624
Okay. If Roger Clifford is
the key to all of this...

1006
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:16,494
Then we need someone
who has access to him.

1007
00:54:16,496 --> 00:54:19,130
And we both know who that is,
lover boy.

1008
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:20,532
Okay, come on, that's...

1009
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:22,470
Come on.
Let's not start that again.

1010
00:54:29,275 --> 00:54:30,708
There she is.

1011
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:33,445
What's with the sunglasses?
Can she see us?

1012
00:54:33,447 --> 00:54:35,045
I don't think she can see us.

1013
00:54:35,047 --> 00:54:38,118
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Don't talk to me.

1014
00:54:39,052 --> 00:54:40,818
Okay.

1015
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,855
- What happens now?
- Just act casual.

1016
00:54:43,857 --> 00:54:46,324
But don't look at me.

1017
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:48,695
There's nothing really casual
about this.

1018
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:50,564
Look at this.

1019
00:54:52,132 --> 00:54:53,630
- Oh, shit.
- Sorry. That was my fault.

1020
00:54:53,632 --> 00:54:55,300
- Ow!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1021
00:54:55,302 --> 00:54:56,635
Oh, this is working out great.

1022
00:54:56,637 --> 00:54:58,003
Why don't you just
have her sit over here.

1023
00:54:58,005 --> 00:54:59,304
You wanna just
come sit with us?

1024
00:54:59,306 --> 00:55:00,204
I should never have
encouraged you.

1025
00:55:00,206 --> 00:55:01,440
You have no chance.

1026
00:55:01,442 --> 00:55:02,608
I got access
to Roger's computer.

1027
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:04,076
Oh, wow, how'd you do that?

1028
00:55:04,078 --> 00:55:05,510
Spilled a cappuccino
on his lap.

1029
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:06,710
Eh, that sounds like
a waste of coffee.

1030
00:55:06,712 --> 00:55:08,346
I searched through
all his records.

1031
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:09,780
I targeted the property rights
in the region

1032
00:55:09,782 --> 00:55:11,516
and I cross-checked that
with city records

1033
00:55:11,518 --> 00:55:14,186
for any Clifford-financed
businesses until I found it.

1034
00:55:14,188 --> 00:55:16,721
May I present PCL:

1035
00:55:16,723 --> 00:55:19,123
A Pokemon genetic
research facility.

1036
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,257
But that's not all.

1037
00:55:20,259 --> 00:55:21,425
She's good.

1038
00:55:21,427 --> 00:55:23,594
Last week,
PCL had an "accident"

1039
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:25,130
and had to shut down
their entire facility.

1040
00:55:25,132 --> 00:55:28,199
That's the same night
Harry Goodman went missing.

1041
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:29,967
No one knows what happened.

1042
00:55:29,969 --> 00:55:32,235
Total media blackout.

1043
00:55:32,237 --> 00:55:33,704
What does it all mean?

1044
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:35,472
I don't know.
This is very exciting.

1045
00:55:35,474 --> 00:55:37,007
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

1046
00:55:37,009 --> 00:55:38,777
I think he just peed a little.

1047
00:55:38,779 --> 00:55:41,146
Oh, nope. That's me.
That was me.

1048
00:55:41,148 --> 00:55:44,282
So, um, there's a cover-up?

1049
00:55:44,284 --> 00:55:45,552
Mmm-hmm.

1050
00:55:46,518 --> 00:55:48,688
But, er,
what are they covering up?

1051
00:55:50,157 --> 00:55:52,293
What do you say
we go find out?

1052
00:56:09,007 --> 00:56:10,374
So let me get this right.

1053
00:56:10,376 --> 00:56:12,510
We're forced to listen
to this spa music

1054
00:56:12,512 --> 00:56:15,179
so your head doesn't explode
and kill us all.

1055
00:56:15,181 --> 00:56:16,614
Psyduck.

1056
00:56:16,616 --> 00:56:19,253
Your Pikachu
is so unusual.

1057
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:21,152
Psyduck.

1058
00:56:21,154 --> 00:56:23,721
Hey, you put that down.
I am not giving you a massage.

1059
00:56:23,723 --> 00:56:24,923
Psyduck.

1060
00:56:24,925 --> 00:56:27,391
I have never known a Pokemon
to wear a hat.

1061
00:56:27,393 --> 00:56:29,027
Yeah, he's weird.
He's so weird.

1062
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:30,262
Psyduck.

1063
00:56:30,264 --> 00:56:31,862
Of course I care
about my partner's life.

1064
00:56:31,864 --> 00:56:33,264
Fine, fine. Hand it over.

1065
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:35,900
What are you doing?

1066
00:56:35,902 --> 00:56:37,367
What?

1067
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:38,635
Nothing.

1068
00:56:38,637 --> 00:56:41,407
I was actually wondering
who this was.

1069
00:56:42,742 --> 00:56:46,110
It's PCL's chief scientist,
Dr. Anne Laurent.

1070
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:48,246
I bet this is the doctor
Shirtless was talking about.

1071
00:56:48,248 --> 00:56:49,480
She lost
her university grant

1072
00:56:49,482 --> 00:56:50,882
over experimentation
of Pokemon

1073
00:56:50,884 --> 00:56:52,916
because she was trying to
control their minds.

1074
00:56:52,918 --> 00:56:54,085
Oh, wow.

1075
00:56:54,087 --> 00:56:56,420
She's essentially
a neurologist for Pokemon.

1076
00:56:56,422 --> 00:56:57,755
Maybe she could weigh in

1077
00:56:57,757 --> 00:56:59,157
on the long-term
psychological effects

1078
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:01,226
of being strapped
into a baby seat

1079
00:57:01,228 --> 00:57:03,297
- next to a bomb.
- Hmm?

1080
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:08,735
This is it.

1081
00:57:11,572 --> 00:57:12,940
Look at the signs.

1082
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:16,840
Must have been
a really bad accident.

1083
00:57:16,842 --> 00:57:18,643
That's
what they want you to believe.

1084
00:57:18,645 --> 00:57:20,644
Whoever staged this
did an excellent job.

1085
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,646
Those signs are the perfect
scarecrow for suckers.

1086
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,548
Yeah, well,
they're working on me.

1087
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,983
Kid, this dame's
looking for danger.

1088
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,253
You want to win her over,

1089
00:57:28,255 --> 00:57:29,786
you gotta lead her
straight to it.

1090
00:57:29,788 --> 00:57:32,391
First of all, women don't like
to be called "dame".

1091
00:57:32,393 --> 00:57:36,460
Second, women appreciate calm,
er, level-headed

1092
00:57:36,462 --> 00:57:39,164
and responsible
decision-making.

1093
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:41,602
What is she doing? Hey, hey!

1094
00:57:42,235 --> 00:57:43,534
Hey!

1095
00:57:43,536 --> 00:57:45,737
Lucy, what are you doing?

1096
00:57:45,739 --> 00:57:49,306
I'm, er, I'm cutting the fence
so that we can slip through.

1097
00:57:49,308 --> 00:57:50,574
Where did you get those?

1098
00:57:50,576 --> 00:57:51,876
Oh,
don't worry about it.

1099
00:57:51,878 --> 00:57:53,610
After you, sir.

1100
00:57:53,612 --> 00:57:54,878
- Psyduck.
- No? Okay.

1101
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,047
I'll go first.
Whatever's most calming.

1102
00:57:56,049 --> 00:57:57,351
Hmm, Psyduck.

1103
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:15,733
Okay.

1104
00:58:16,837 --> 00:58:19,639
Psyduck. Psyduck.

1105
00:58:24,244 --> 00:58:25,446
Oh.

1106
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:29,015
It's okay.
You can stay up there.

1107
00:58:36,422 --> 00:58:39,157
I may have
amnesia, but I'm pretty sure

1108
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:41,762
this is the worst idea
anyone's ever had.

1109
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,099
What is that?

1110
00:58:47,467 --> 00:58:48,902
I'm not sure.

1111
00:58:51,603 --> 00:58:54,271
Psyduck. Psyduck.

1112
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,775
It's Greninja.

1113
00:58:57,777 --> 00:58:59,876
But they don't look right.

1114
00:58:59,878 --> 00:59:01,746
"Test 22."

1115
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:03,617
"Power enhancement"?

1116
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:07,251
They were experimenting
on them.

1117
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:08,485
But why?

1118
00:59:08,487 --> 00:59:09,954
If Roger Clifford's
behind this,

1119
00:59:09,956 --> 00:59:12,693
what's he doing
experimenting on Pokemon?

1120
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:22,032
A Torterra garden.

1121
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,041
"Pokemon
evolution test 33.

1122
00:59:30,043 --> 00:59:31,909
"Growth enhancement."

1123
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:34,679
They look normal-sized to me.

1124
00:59:34,681 --> 00:59:37,414
Maybe it hasn't started yet.

1125
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:42,286
It's like they're trying to
manipulate Pokemon evolution.

1126
00:59:42,288 --> 00:59:44,554
Is that even possible?

1127
00:59:44,556 --> 00:59:46,623
I don't know.

1128
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:49,529
I need to document
all of this, though.

1129
00:59:54,668 --> 00:59:56,201
<i>You go ahead.
I'll catch up to you.</i>

1130
00:59:56,203 --> 00:59:57,871
- <i>Are you sure?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1131
01:00:14,186 --> 01:00:15,188
Whoa.

1132
01:00:17,056 --> 01:00:18,590
What happened here?

1133
01:00:18,592 --> 01:00:20,324
Bad stuff.

1134
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:22,860
Really bad stuff.

1135
01:00:22,862 --> 01:00:25,329
Still think
this was staged?

1136
01:00:31,804 --> 01:00:35,373
Kid, hey! Over here.

1137
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:38,275
It says Dr. Laurent's station.

1138
01:00:38,277 --> 01:00:40,213
Looks like it's still working.

1139
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:51,757
<i>Remote access initiated.</i>

1140
01:00:58,431 --> 01:01:00,166
Psyduck!

1141
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:08,040
Looks like most of the files
are corrupted.

1142
01:01:09,976 --> 01:01:13,012
Uh-oh. Another one
of those holograms.

1143
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:25,956
Day 42.

1144
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,858
After much trial and error

1145
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,827
we perfected a stable method

1146
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:33,429
to extract Mewtwo's DNA.

1147
01:01:33,431 --> 01:01:35,632
It's Mewtwo. No, wait.

1148
01:01:35,634 --> 01:01:37,937
Wait, Mewtwo came
from this place?

1149
01:01:39,306 --> 01:01:44,175
Day 60. Clinical trials
proven successful.

1150
01:01:44,177 --> 01:01:47,110
The inhalant
results in confusion

1151
01:01:47,112 --> 01:01:50,248
and the total loss
of free will.

1152
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:54,619
Which, in turn,
makes the Pokemon go wild.

1153
01:01:54,621 --> 01:01:59,059
We've designated
this chemical as serum R.

1154
01:02:01,061 --> 01:02:02,760
They used Mewtwo to make R.

1155
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:05,965
And they were testing it
at the battles.

1156
01:02:09,335 --> 01:02:11,835
Day 68.

1157
01:02:11,837 --> 01:02:14,271
The neural link
is operational.

1158
01:02:14,273 --> 01:02:15,639
<i>Alert.</i>

1159
01:02:15,641 --> 01:02:18,011
- <i>Condition: Red.</i>
- Oh.

1160
01:02:20,645 --> 01:02:22,280
No. No, no, no!

1161
01:02:22,282 --> 01:02:24,248
We're losing power
in the containment...

1162
01:02:36,563 --> 01:02:38,429
That must've been
how Mewtwo escaped.

1163
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:39,764
Now we're getting somewhere.

1164
01:02:39,766 --> 01:02:41,666
What did that thing
want with Harry?

1165
01:02:41,668 --> 01:02:43,034
Good question, kid.

1166
01:02:43,036 --> 01:02:45,670
I'll try and take us back
to the beginning.

1167
01:02:51,511 --> 01:02:54,945
Day 1.
The lab is almost fully operational.

1168
01:02:54,947 --> 01:02:56,880
All that remains now
is to capture

1169
01:02:56,882 --> 01:03:00,150
the most powerful Pokemon
known to mankind:

1170
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:02,186
Mewtwo.

1171
01:03:02,188 --> 01:03:06,090
It escaped nearly 20 years ago
from the Kanto region.

1172
01:03:06,092 --> 01:03:07,659
Fortunately, our benefactor's

1173
01:03:07,661 --> 01:03:09,793
hired a specialist
to track it down.

1174
01:03:09,795 --> 01:03:11,364
Good luck, Detective Goodman.

1175
01:03:18,404 --> 01:03:20,605
That's why Mewtwo took Harry.

1176
01:03:20,607 --> 01:03:22,706
It was revenge
for being captured.

1177
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:24,074
This doesn't make any sense.

1178
01:03:24,076 --> 01:03:25,677
Harry would've
never been a part of this.

1179
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:27,445
I wanna believe that, kid.
But we gotta be honest here.

1180
01:03:27,447 --> 01:03:29,679
You haven't seen him in years,
and I got amnesia.

1181
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:30,882
Neither of us can say for sure

1182
01:03:30,884 --> 01:03:32,317
what Harry would
or wouldn't do.

1183
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:33,885
We gotta
get back to the city.

1184
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,990
Lucy. Lucy,
we gotta get back to...

1185
01:03:41,395 --> 01:03:42,762
Lucy?

1186
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,762
Lucy?

1187
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:55,775
That was not there
before, kid.

1188
01:03:58,578 --> 01:03:59,980
Ew.

1189
01:04:07,286 --> 01:04:09,152
Look behind you.

1190
01:04:09,154 --> 01:04:11,422
Whoa!

1191
01:04:11,424 --> 01:04:12,759
Kid, the fire alarm!

1192
01:04:17,264 --> 01:04:18,429
Psyduck!

1193
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,099
Come on! Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

1194
01:04:23,203 --> 01:04:24,936
- Psyduck!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go back.

1195
01:04:24,938 --> 01:04:27,174
Psyduck!

1196
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:30,744
Psyduck!

1197
01:04:32,813 --> 01:04:34,948
Psyduck!

1198
01:04:36,282 --> 01:04:37,648
Get down!

1199
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:40,119
Psyduck!

1200
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,922
Come on!

1201
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:46,356
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

1202
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:48,458
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

1203
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,927
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

1204
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,496
Duck! Duck! Duck!

1205
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,471
Psyduck! Psyduck!
Psyduck! Psyduck!

1206
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:01,572
- Psyduck!
- It's okay, Psyduck.

1207
01:05:01,574 --> 01:05:02,773
Everything's fine.

1208
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:04,141
He's gonna
blow his stack, kid.

1209
01:05:04,143 --> 01:05:06,445
It's okay, Psyduck, it's okay.
Calm down.

1210
01:05:07,913 --> 01:05:10,015
Psyduck!

1211
01:05:11,918 --> 01:05:12,916
This is no time

1212
01:05:12,918 --> 01:05:14,518
for your stupid headaches.

1213
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,221
No, wait, this is the perfect
time to get a headache.

1214
01:05:17,223 --> 01:05:19,389
- Psyduck?
- I hated rubbing your feet.

1215
01:05:19,391 --> 01:05:21,124
Calm down, calm down!

1216
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,027
I'll never forgive my hands
for what they did.

1217
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:25,996
Get a splitting headache now,
you neurotic duck!

1218
01:05:25,998 --> 01:05:28,965
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1219
01:05:37,876 --> 01:05:39,844
Psyduck.

1220
01:05:39,846 --> 01:05:42,547
Good job, Psyduck.
Where's my hat?

1221
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,489
Something's wrong.

1222
01:06:06,204 --> 01:06:08,706
Is this really happening?

1223
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:10,273
Don't worry.

1224
01:06:10,275 --> 01:06:13,076
Psyduck's psionic waves
are causing hallucinations.

1225
01:06:13,078 --> 01:06:14,445
None of this is real.

1226
01:06:14,447 --> 01:06:15,878
Nope.

1227
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,947
All of this is real! Run!

1228
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:19,485
Go, go, go!

1229
01:06:27,492 --> 01:06:30,527
- What's happening?
- Let's go! Let's go!

1230
01:06:32,498 --> 01:06:34,130
At this point,

1231
01:06:34,132 --> 01:06:37,369
how could you not
believe in climate change?

1232
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:52,382
Oh no, no, no!

1233
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:53,386
I got you.

1234
01:06:54,753 --> 01:06:55,956
Tim!

1235
01:06:58,424 --> 01:07:00,425
Go! Run! Run!

1236
01:07:00,427 --> 01:07:02,295
Go, go, go, go!

1237
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,898
Go, go, go!

1238
01:07:08,701 --> 01:07:10,403
Okay.

1239
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:20,878
We made it.

1240
01:07:21,947 --> 01:07:24,083
I officially hate this forest.

1241
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:33,994
Tim!

1242
01:07:34,793 --> 01:07:35,960
Lucy!

1243
01:07:35,962 --> 01:07:37,197
Tim!

1244
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:38,932
Psyduck!

1245
01:07:48,206 --> 01:07:50,273
Kid, the walls are closing in.

1246
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:52,976
We have to do something
and we gotta do it fast.

1247
01:07:52,978 --> 01:07:54,646
I gotta jump for it.

1248
01:07:54,648 --> 01:07:57,148
That's a great fifth option.
Let's work on the first four.

1249
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:59,315
- You're not gonna make it!
- There's no other choice.

1250
01:07:59,317 --> 01:08:00,784
We have a lot of choices.

1251
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:02,521
Falling to our death
is not one of...

1252
01:08:09,529 --> 01:08:11,494
Tim!

1253
01:08:11,496 --> 01:08:13,797
Pull, pull, pull!

1254
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:15,067
Come on!

1255
01:08:18,436 --> 01:08:21,071
I thought I was gonna...
I thought I was gonna...

1256
01:08:21,073 --> 01:08:24,040
I... I...

1257
01:08:24,042 --> 01:08:25,241
Eyeball.

1258
01:08:25,243 --> 01:08:27,380
Eyeball. Eyeball!

1259
01:08:39,558 --> 01:08:42,427
Oh! I get it!

1260
01:08:42,429 --> 01:08:46,030
I get it now.
This isn't a forest at all.

1261
01:08:46,032 --> 01:08:49,636
This is the Torterra garden.

1262
01:08:58,077 --> 01:08:59,209
Pikachu!

1263
01:09:25,304 --> 01:09:27,107
Psyduck.

1264
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:32,209
He's hurt.

1265
01:09:33,746 --> 01:09:36,047
- Is he okay?
- I'm in bad shape, kid.

1266
01:09:36,049 --> 01:09:37,915
I'm here, partner. I'm here.

1267
01:09:39,152 --> 01:09:42,018
Did you just call me partner?

1268
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,754
Yeah, of course.
You're my partner.

1269
01:09:43,756 --> 01:09:46,326
Yeah, that's right.
You've, er...

1270
01:09:47,659 --> 01:09:49,994
You've got my back.

1271
01:09:49,996 --> 01:09:52,028
Hey, hey, hey. Bud.

1272
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:55,734
Hey! Hey, Pikachu!

1273
01:09:57,135 --> 01:09:58,637
Pikachu!

1274
01:09:59,537 --> 01:10:00,639
No.

1275
01:10:07,046 --> 01:10:09,679
Hey! Hey, help!

1276
01:10:09,681 --> 01:10:11,182
Please!

1277
01:10:11,184 --> 01:10:12,585
Please.

1278
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:14,654
He's hurt.

1279
01:10:15,153 --> 01:10:16,754
Please.

1280
01:10:19,658 --> 01:10:21,661
He doesn't know
what you're saying.

1281
01:10:27,132 --> 01:10:29,101
But he knows what I'm feeling.

1282
01:10:32,305 --> 01:10:35,508
I need to get Pikachu
to a healer Pokemon.

1283
01:10:36,175 --> 01:10:38,107
Please.

1284
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:40,279
I'm begging you.

1285
01:10:41,346 --> 01:10:43,449
I don't wanna lose him, too.

1286
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,232
It's okay.

1287
01:11:03,569 --> 01:11:05,737
Hmm?

1288
01:11:08,873 --> 01:11:11,808
Tim, look.

1289
01:11:39,605 --> 01:11:40,672
Okay.

1290
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:44,844
I'll meet you at the car.

1291
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,582
You're gonna be okay, partner.

1292
01:13:13,131 --> 01:13:14,366
Here?

1293
01:13:26,177 --> 01:13:27,977
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

1294
01:13:27,979 --> 01:13:30,080
Where are you going?

1295
01:13:30,082 --> 01:13:32,348
What am I supposed to do?

1296
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:34,920
I've been waiting for you.

1297
01:13:39,925 --> 01:13:40,927
Mewtwo.

1298
01:13:42,994 --> 01:13:44,995
No, no, no! No, wait!

1299
01:14:03,149 --> 01:14:04,384
Where am I?

1300
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:06,349
You're okay!

1301
01:14:06,351 --> 01:14:07,852
Yeah.

1302
01:14:07,854 --> 01:14:09,519
Somehow, I'm fine.

1303
01:14:09,521 --> 01:14:12,457
You brought
the son to me, as agreed.

1304
01:14:14,091 --> 01:14:15,425
What is he talking about?

1305
01:14:15,427 --> 01:14:18,262
I don't know, kid.
I'm as lost as you are.

1306
01:14:18,264 --> 01:14:20,063
Where's my father?

1307
01:14:20,065 --> 01:14:21,367
What'd you do with him?

1308
01:14:33,211 --> 01:14:34,611
- <i>Alert.</i>
- Oh.

1309
01:14:34,613 --> 01:14:37,049
We're losing power
in the containment chamber.

1310
01:14:44,556 --> 01:14:46,458
You've done well.

1311
01:14:47,126 --> 01:14:49,860
Humanity is evil.

1312
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:52,465
I've always believed
Pokemon are...

1313
01:14:53,765 --> 01:14:56,266
No!

1314
01:15:06,944 --> 01:15:08,081
No!

1315
01:15:32,171 --> 01:15:34,071
Wait, wait, wait!

1316
01:15:34,073 --> 01:15:36,706
Pikachu! Wait.

1317
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:39,876
Hey. Slow down.
We have to talk about this.

1318
01:15:39,878 --> 01:15:41,644
You have to go on without me.

1319
01:15:41,646 --> 01:15:43,414
What? What are you saying?

1320
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,949
Roger has Mewtwo.
Mewtwo has my father.

1321
01:15:45,951 --> 01:15:47,750
We're running out of time.
We have a case to solve.

1322
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:49,952
We already solved mine.
I know who I am.

1323
01:15:49,954 --> 01:15:52,422
I'm the guy
who betrayed Harry.

1324
01:15:52,424 --> 01:15:53,889
We don't know that.

1325
01:15:53,891 --> 01:15:58,398
We both saw it. I betrayed
your father. Which means

1326
01:15:59,163 --> 01:16:00,563
I could betray you, too.

1327
01:16:00,565 --> 01:16:02,632
You wouldn't do that.
I don't care what I saw.

1328
01:16:02,634 --> 01:16:04,500
- I know who you are.
- How do you know?

1329
01:16:04,502 --> 01:16:05,835
Because, I...

1330
01:16:05,837 --> 01:16:07,571
I can feel it in my jellies.

1331
01:16:07,573 --> 01:16:09,004
I... I made that up.

1332
01:16:09,006 --> 01:16:11,174
There's no jellies.
There's no me.

1333
01:16:11,176 --> 01:16:12,308
I don't believe that.

1334
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:13,410
You're better off on your own.

1335
01:16:13,412 --> 01:16:14,577
- Come on, Pikachu...
- No! No!

1336
01:16:14,579 --> 01:16:16,146
I need you. Please.

1337
01:16:16,148 --> 01:16:17,915
You have to stay away.
It's for your own good.

1338
01:16:17,917 --> 01:16:19,581
No. I'm not letting you go.

1339
01:16:25,023 --> 01:16:26,426
You see?

1340
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,758
I can't help it.

1341
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,762
I hurt the people who need me.

1342
01:16:31,363 --> 01:16:32,964
That's who I am.

1343
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,067
I'm sorry.

1344
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:38,170
I'm sorry.

1345
01:16:38,938 --> 01:16:40,038
Tim.

1346
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:43,040
Where's he going?

1347
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:45,077
Hey, what happened?

1348
01:16:46,045 --> 01:16:48,245
Is Pikachu okay?

1349
01:16:48,247 --> 01:16:50,981
No, he's not.

1350
01:16:50,983 --> 01:16:53,786
Let's go.
We gotta get back to the city.

1351
01:16:57,355 --> 01:16:58,455
Okay.

1352
01:16:58,457 --> 01:17:00,156
Come on.

1353
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:02,125
<i>The 10th anniversary</i>

1354
01:17:02,127 --> 01:17:05,195
<i>Ryme City Pokemon parade is
set to begin this afternoon.</i>

1355
01:17:05,197 --> 01:17:07,798
<i>The whole city is converging
on downtown</i>

1356
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,036
<i>to watch
the day's festivities.</i>

1357
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,909
I don't know what happened
between you two,

1358
01:17:18,911 --> 01:17:20,509
but we need
to strategize. Wait!

1359
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,878
Where are you going?

1360
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,112
We need to tell the public
what we found.

1361
01:17:23,114 --> 01:17:24,248
This is breaking news.

1362
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:26,517
No. No, you should
break the news. You.

1363
01:17:26,519 --> 01:17:28,184
I'm gonna go talk to Howard.

1364
01:17:28,186 --> 01:17:29,585
How...

1365
01:17:29,587 --> 01:17:30,853
Tim!

1366
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:32,422
How am I supposed to
break the news

1367
01:17:32,424 --> 01:17:35,125
when the guy who runs the news
is the breaking news?

1368
01:17:35,127 --> 01:17:39,699
Okay, Cynthia. We're live
in five, four, three...

1369
01:17:41,332 --> 01:17:42,866
Stay in the car, okay?

1370
01:17:42,868 --> 01:17:43,936
Psyduck!

1371
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,750
Mrs. McMaster.
Hi, it's Lucy Stevens,

1372
01:17:59,752 --> 01:18:00,851
- the intern.
- Oh.

1373
01:18:00,853 --> 01:18:02,418
- At CNM?
- Could you...

1374
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:04,153
Yeah. Erm, I have a story

1375
01:18:04,155 --> 01:18:05,888
that's really important that
the people need to hear.

1376
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,624
And I was really hoping
you could help me tell it.

1377
01:18:07,626 --> 01:18:08,959
I just need...

1378
01:18:08,961 --> 01:18:10,593
Lucy, please.
Take my coffee order.

1379
01:18:10,595 --> 01:18:12,764

1380
01:18:15,868 --> 01:18:19,102

1390
01:18:47,632 --> 01:18:49,068
I know this place.

1391
01:18:52,904 --> 01:18:55,574
This is the scene
of the crash.

1392
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,311
What is that?

1393
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,748
Greninja stars.

1394
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:09,486
Roger must have
sent the Greninjas

1395
01:19:09,488 --> 01:19:11,620
to cause the crash. Which...

1396
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,924
Which means...

1397
01:19:13,926 --> 01:19:16,796
Mewtwo was trying
to protect us?

1398
01:19:18,698 --> 01:19:20,864
<i>Advanced holographic imaging.</i>

1399
01:19:20,866 --> 01:19:23,733
It allows us to see things

1400
01:19:23,735 --> 01:19:25,334
<i>or don't want us to see.</i>

1401
01:19:25,336 --> 01:19:28,938
Wait, Howard would have seen
this in his hologram.

1402
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:31,174
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

1403
01:19:31,176 --> 01:19:32,976
Tim!

1404
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:35,745
Howard! Mr. Clifford!
Your son,

1405
01:19:35,747 --> 01:19:38,581
he has Mewtwo here.

1406
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:40,683
- Wait, why do you...
- Tim.

1407
01:19:40,685 --> 01:19:42,951
It's gonna be okay.

1408
01:19:50,461 --> 01:19:52,831
Run!

1409
01:19:53,532 --> 01:19:54,630
No.

1410
01:20:12,818 --> 01:20:15,087
The transfer worked.

1411
01:20:15,988 --> 01:20:17,990
My body is in the chair,

1412
01:20:19,491 --> 01:20:23,192
but my mind is in Mewtwo.

1413
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:24,326
Howard?

1414
01:20:24,328 --> 01:20:25,661
Well done, Tim.

1415
01:20:25,663 --> 01:20:30,166
You and Harry's Pikachu
led me straight to Mewtwo.

1416
01:20:30,168 --> 01:20:31,834
Mewtwo didn't cause the crash.

1417
01:20:31,836 --> 01:20:33,704
All your father had to do

1418
01:20:33,706 --> 01:20:35,906
was take the money
and walk away.

1419
01:20:35,908 --> 01:20:37,674
But he started
asking questions.

1420
01:20:37,676 --> 01:20:38,808
I had to stop him.

1421
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:40,209
You tried to kill him!

1422
01:20:40,211 --> 01:20:41,210
I had no choice.

1423
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:43,612
He tracked the R
to the battles,

1424
01:20:43,614 --> 01:20:45,348
traced it back to Dr. Laurent.

1425
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:48,617
And then he and his Pikachu
helped Mewtwo escape.

1426
01:20:52,925 --> 01:20:54,389
So, as you can see,

1427
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,392
we are more than happy
with the turnout today.

1428
01:20:56,394 --> 01:20:58,027
So many families...

1429
01:20:58,029 --> 01:20:59,829
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1430
01:20:59,831 --> 01:21:01,464
That's all for today.
Thank you.

1431
01:21:01,466 --> 01:21:03,267
Excuse me, please. Hello. Hi.

1432
01:21:03,269 --> 01:21:05,334
I have an interview
with the mayor.

1433
01:21:05,336 --> 01:21:07,169
- Go on through.
- Thank you.

1434
01:21:07,171 --> 01:21:09,673
Mr. Mayor, I need to speak
with you, please. It's urgent.

1435
01:21:09,675 --> 01:21:11,407
A little late for an
interview, don't you think?

1436
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:12,444
Please!

1437
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:15,644
Before we begin the parade,

1438
01:21:15,646 --> 01:21:17,481
I'd like to thank
our benefactor,

1439
01:21:17,483 --> 01:21:18,749
Howard Clifford.

1440
01:21:18,751 --> 01:21:21,084
This was never
about curing me.

1441
01:21:21,086 --> 01:21:24,620
I have found a path forward
for all of us.

1442
01:21:24,622 --> 01:21:26,188
Mewtwo has the power

1443
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:28,058
to transfer
the soul of a human

1444
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,491
into the body of a Pokemon,

1445
01:21:29,493 --> 01:21:33,629
as long as the Pokemon
are in a crazed state.

1446
01:21:33,631 --> 01:21:36,067
The R gas takes care of that.

1447
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:40,973
The balloons.
The R gas is in the balloons.

1448
01:21:50,482 --> 01:21:52,883
People of Ryme City!

1449
01:21:52,885 --> 01:21:55,785
I've finally discovered
a cure.

1450
01:21:55,787 --> 01:21:57,887
Not just for me,

1451
01:21:57,889 --> 01:22:00,490
but for all of humanity!

1452
01:22:00,492 --> 01:22:05,026
Pokemon can evolve into better
versions of themselves.

1453
01:22:05,028 --> 01:22:07,830
And, now, so can you!

1454
01:22:07,832 --> 01:22:12,404
Humans and Pokemon
merged into one!

1455
01:22:25,116 --> 01:22:27,787
Don't let your Pokemon breathe
the purple gas!

1456
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:31,389
Come on! Get out of here!

1457
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:37,827
This is Yoshida
requesting backup!

1458
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:40,630
All units should proceed
to the...

1459
01:22:40,632 --> 01:22:43,001
Snubbull, no!

1460
01:22:52,911 --> 01:22:54,910
Don't let your Pokemon
breathe the gas!

1461
01:22:54,912 --> 01:22:56,245
Don't let your Pokemon...

1462
01:22:56,247 --> 01:22:58,183
Oh, no! Don't breathe the gas!

1463
01:23:01,452 --> 01:23:02,818
Tell them!

1464
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,786
This is Lucy Stevens reporting
a citywide emergency.

1465
01:23:04,788 --> 01:23:06,289
Do not let
your Pokemon breathe...

1466
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:07,893
Psyduck, no! Don't!

1467
01:23:10,162 --> 01:23:13,265
Psyduck,
Psyduck. Psyduck!

1468
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,302
Psyduck?

1469
01:23:25,342 --> 01:23:28,846
Okay. Worst parade
I've ever seen.

1470
01:23:28,848 --> 01:23:31,380
- Psyduck.
- Lucy. Lucy, you're in there?

1471
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:33,316
- Where's Tim?
- Psyduck. Psyduck.

1472
01:23:33,318 --> 01:23:37,820
- Howard is Mewtwo?
- Psyduck. Psyduck.

1473
01:23:37,822 --> 01:23:41,825
This really blows my bridge
discovery out of the water.

1474
01:23:41,827 --> 01:23:44,593
All right, I gotta stop this.

1475
01:23:44,595 --> 01:23:45,598
Game on!

1476
01:23:55,607 --> 01:23:58,875
Okay, Pikachu, your powers
are in there somewhere.

1477
01:23:58,877 --> 01:24:00,242
Just need a little spark

1478
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:02,144
to get this party started.
Let's do this.

1479
01:24:09,822 --> 01:24:12,021
Harry's Pikachu.

1480
01:24:13,491 --> 01:24:16,927
You think you can stand
in the way of the future?

1481
01:24:16,929 --> 01:24:19,064
I am the future!

1482
01:24:30,309 --> 01:24:31,310
Whoa!

1483
01:25:01,273 --> 01:25:03,071
He's back!

1484
01:25:12,818 --> 01:25:14,450
The neural link.

1485
01:25:20,926 --> 01:25:22,127
Roger?

1486
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:26,431
Behind you!

1487
01:25:40,644 --> 01:25:41,980
You're a Ditto.

1488
01:25:42,948 --> 01:25:44,149
Ditto.

1489
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:57,559
Bank left! Bank right! Right!

1490
01:25:57,561 --> 01:26:00,763
Where did you learn
how to fly? The ground?

1491
01:26:00,765 --> 01:26:03,769
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop!
Wait, wait, wait!

1492
01:26:05,237 --> 01:26:06,438
Wait, wait, wait!

1493
01:26:11,909 --> 01:26:14,343
Come on. No. That's not fair.

1494
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:20,183
For the record,
I have no guilt

1495
01:26:20,185 --> 01:26:21,950
hitting a beady-eyed
version of the woman

1496
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,254
I'm very attracted to.

1497
01:26:27,626 --> 01:26:30,729
Uh-oh! Pull up, pull up.
Don't breathe the gas.

1498
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:33,830
You breathed the gas,
didn't you?

1499
01:26:42,274 --> 01:26:43,607
Yeah!

1500
01:27:08,233 --> 01:27:10,032
Finish him, Ditto!

1501
01:27:10,034 --> 01:27:11,235
Ditto!

1502
01:27:22,113 --> 01:27:24,282
No! No, no, no, no!

1503
01:27:29,887 --> 01:27:31,223
Pikachu!

1504
01:27:32,157 --> 01:27:34,824
Tim!

1505
01:27:34,826 --> 01:27:37,692
Harry's son is finished!

1506
01:27:37,694 --> 01:27:41,330
No. Tim said Volt Tackle's
my best move.

1507
01:27:41,332 --> 01:27:44,099
Let's do this
Pokemon battle thing right.

1508
01:27:53,944 --> 01:27:55,010
No.

1509
01:28:02,854 --> 01:28:04,153
Yeah!

1510
01:28:04,155 --> 01:28:05,989
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

1511
01:28:11,061 --> 01:28:12,696
What kind of a Ditto was that?

1512
01:28:12,698 --> 01:28:16,165
That was one of my father's
genetic experiments.

1513
01:28:44,996 --> 01:28:47,129
Psyduck. Ditto.

1514
01:28:47,131 --> 01:28:48,866
Ditto...

1515
01:29:01,212 --> 01:29:02,778
A feeble effort.

1516
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:07,918
A Pikachu cannot defeat
Mewtwo in battle.

1517
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,253
I didn't need to defeat you.

1518
01:29:10,255 --> 01:29:12,724
I just needed to distract you.

1519
01:29:15,059 --> 01:29:16,261
Huh.

1520
01:29:17,127 --> 01:29:18,462
No!

1521
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:20,332
No!

1522
01:29:24,402 --> 01:29:26,637
What have you done?

1523
01:29:29,172 --> 01:29:30,608
Pikachu!

1524
01:29:31,609 --> 01:29:32,644
No!

1525
01:29:47,058 --> 01:29:49,558
- Pikachu!
- Tim!

1526
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,294
- Oh!
- Are you okay?

1527
01:29:51,296 --> 01:29:53,762
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I pushed you away

1528
01:29:53,764 --> 01:29:55,598
just when you needed me
the most.

1529
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,902
I'm just happy you're back...

1530
01:29:59,103 --> 01:30:00,338
partner.

1531
01:30:02,274 --> 01:30:04,907
Please tell me
you can fix this mess.

1532
01:30:04,909 --> 01:30:08,479
I will undo
what has been done.

1533
01:30:39,277 --> 01:30:42,713
Let's never
do that again, okay?

1534
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:02,197
The strange thing is that,
no matter what his flaws,

1535
01:31:02,199 --> 01:31:04,500
deep down,

1536
01:31:04,502 --> 01:31:07,836
I blame myself
for not being there for him.

1537
01:31:07,838 --> 01:31:10,505
You. You were working
on this story.

1538
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:13,275
Had a lead on it before
anyone else even knew.

1539
01:31:13,277 --> 01:31:14,576
That's correct.

1540
01:31:14,578 --> 01:31:15,911
Good. Right,
you're going on camera.

1541
01:31:15,913 --> 01:31:17,614
I want you giving
an in-depth report

1542
01:31:17,616 --> 01:31:19,615
for CNM tonight, primetime.

1543
01:31:19,617 --> 01:31:21,383
And make sure you close with:

1544
01:31:21,385 --> 01:31:23,652
"Roger Clifford
pledges to undo

1545
01:31:23,654 --> 01:31:25,754
all the harm his father caused

1546
01:31:25,756 --> 01:31:29,527
starting with the Pokemon
he experimented on."

1547
01:31:32,063 --> 01:31:34,263
I can't believe we did it.

1548
01:31:34,265 --> 01:31:35,897
Psyduck.

1549
01:31:35,899 --> 01:31:39,367
Great work. Hey, calm down.
Stay calm. Okay.

1550
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:40,669
Oh, I hope we never

1551
01:31:40,671 --> 01:31:42,237
- get to see each other again.
- Hmm.

1552
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:45,607
- Meet me later tonight?
- Cool. I mean, yeah.

1553
01:31:45,609 --> 01:31:47,545
Okay.

1554
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,413
Come on.

1555
01:31:50,415 --> 01:31:52,014
Psyduck.
Psyduck. Psyduck.

1556
01:31:53,251 --> 01:31:54,619
Way to go, Tim.

1557
01:31:55,987 --> 01:31:59,725
There is one last thing
I must fix.

1558
01:32:03,493 --> 01:32:05,260
My father.

1559
01:32:05,262 --> 01:32:07,597
The father
you have been looking for

1560
01:32:07,599 --> 01:32:10,502
has been with you all along.

1561
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:13,939
What's he talking about?

1562
01:32:15,506 --> 01:32:16,875
I don't...

1563
01:32:36,094 --> 01:32:37,425
Pika!

1564
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:39,527
Pikachu!

1565
01:32:39,529 --> 01:32:41,364
You've done well.

1566
01:32:41,366 --> 01:32:44,299
Humanity is evil.

1567
01:32:44,301 --> 01:32:49,407
But you have shown me
that not all humans are bad.

1568
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:51,807
Harry Goodman,

1569
01:32:51,809 --> 01:32:56,010
your Pikachu offers its body
to save your mind.

1570
01:32:56,012 --> 01:32:58,114
There is a son.

1571
01:32:58,116 --> 01:33:02,284
With the son's return,
I can repair the father.

1572
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:03,986
Your memory will be gone,

1573
01:33:03,988 --> 01:33:07,556
but your heart will know
who you are.

1574
01:33:07,558 --> 01:33:10,996
I take this body
so that you might live.

1575
01:33:12,063 --> 01:33:14,498
Return with the son.

1576
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:38,387
<i>Now boarding on track three,</i>

1577
01:33:38,389 --> 01:33:40,755
<i>train 453 northbound.</i>

1578
01:33:45,128 --> 01:33:46,564
Hey, kid!

1579
01:34:03,547 --> 01:34:05,750
Grams will meet you
when you arrive.

1580
01:34:06,952 --> 01:34:08,019
Okay.

1581
01:34:14,725 --> 01:34:16,228
I'll see ya.

1582
01:34:17,996 --> 01:34:19,163
See ya.

1583
01:34:45,256 --> 01:34:46,625
Pika.

1584
01:34:49,661 --> 01:34:51,096
Hey, Dad?

1585
01:34:52,329 --> 01:34:53,532
Yeah?

1586
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:57,636
You think I can stay with you
for a while?

1587
01:35:00,337 --> 01:35:02,040
I'd like that, kid.

1588
01:35:02,907 --> 01:35:05,076
Yeah, I'd like that very much.

1589
01:35:08,311 --> 01:35:09,747
Me, too.

1590
01:35:20,658 --> 01:35:22,290
You wanna get a coffee?

1591
01:35:22,292 --> 01:35:23,593
It's the weirdest thing.

1592
01:35:23,595 --> 01:35:25,093
That's all I've been
thinking about,

1593
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:26,829
is having a coffee right now.

1594
01:35:28,233 --> 01:35:30,700
I think
I'll have to find a new job.

1595
01:35:30,702 --> 01:35:33,635
Oh, yeah?
What are you thinking?

1596
01:35:33,637 --> 01:35:36,839
Um... maybe I could give
detective work a try?

1597
01:35:36,841 --> 01:35:38,840
Pika-Pika!

1598
01:35:38,842 --> 01:35:41,078
I think
he likes that idea.

1599
01:37:29,489 --> 01:37:34,489
