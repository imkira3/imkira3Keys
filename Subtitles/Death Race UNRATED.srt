2
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,300
Damn it!

3
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,770
Rear armor?

4
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,870
Shot to hell.

5
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,010
You better
drop back...

6
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,850
It's the last lap.
We can win this.

7
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,650
Why don't this son
of a bitch just die?

8
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,380
Oil.

9
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,480
Out.

10
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,250
Smoke.

11
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,360
Finished.

12
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,560
Give me the napalm!

13
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,160
Nothing works!

14
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,670
Drop the tombstone.

15
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,740
On my mark. Three,

16
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,740
two,

17
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,800
one.

18
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,080
I got you now,
motherfucker.

19
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,150
Mark!

20
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,850
Shit!

21
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,690
Fuck!

22
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,120
That's how you want
to do it? Okay.

23
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,510
He's still coming.
Our tank is exposed.

24
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,280
He's got us, Frank.
You have to drop back.

25
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,980
It's a quarter mile to
the line. I can make it.

26
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,190
<i>Sayonara, Frankie.</i>

27
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,360
Punch out.

28
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,490
I'm sorry.

29
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,520
Forty years.
Longer than my marriage.

30
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,090
Sounds like you're
gonna miss this place.

31
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,100
I still can't believe they
closed it down. Just like that.

32
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,200
The only thing I'm gonna
miss is my paycheck.

33
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,070
Well, it was honest
work for honest men.

34
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,730
I got a family to feed,
and there's no work out there.

35
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,830
I hear they might be
hiring down at the docks.

36
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,570
Five men, maybe.

37
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,480
Hey, thanks, man.

38
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,740
Thanks, Jensen.

39
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,830
<i>Collect your final paycheck and leave.</i>

40
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,230
<i>The main gate will be
locked in 15 minutes.</i>

41
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,710
Get ready to be
ripped off, boys.

42
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,580
<i>Collect your paycheck and leave
the premises in an orderly manner.</i>

43
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,810
<i>The main gate will be
locked in 15 minutes.</i>

44
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,990
Cash or check?

45
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,890
Better make it cash.

46
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,800
$300.

47
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,330
I worked 120 hours
the last two weeks.

48
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,300
Cash fee. Next!
Cash fee?

49
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,770
You wanted cash,
there's a fee.

50
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,200
You want a check
instead?

51
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,040
Seeing as the company's out
of business, not exactly.

52
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,480
You don't like it, there's
the complaint box. Next!

53
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,160
They never get it.

54
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,360
Self-fulfilling prophecy.

55
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,580
We're honest workers.
We're just like you guys!

56
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,090
What the hell are
you doing here?

57
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,860
You bastards!

58
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,260
Shit! Shit!
Ross!

59
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,390
You okay, Ross?

60
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,560
Rubber bullets,
the assholes!

61
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,920
Come on!

62
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,160
Come on!

63
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,970
Hi, honey.

64
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,310
Hi. Sorry
I'm so late.

65
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,090
Nice day at work?

66
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,320
Yeah. Just fine.

67
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,260
Give me that shirt.

68
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,800
They called the riot
police. It got ugly.

69
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,130
I don't deserve you.

70
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,970
You're a good man,
Jensen Ames.

71
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,510
And it doesn't matter what
anyone else thinks but me.

72
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,220
So, $300. That's
all they gave us.

73
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,430
We'll make it last.
We always do.

74
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,590
I'll start
looking tomorrow.

75
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,230
I think you're forgetting
that I married you

76
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,630
for your
non-financial assets.

77
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,840
Did you now?

78
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,000
Mmm-hmm.

79
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,660
Daddy's home. Is it you
who was making all that noise?

80
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,130
<i>What does little
Piper want? Want a story?</i>

81
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,410
You know you
won't understand it.

82
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,140
<i>But it will be good practice for me.
But it will be good practice for me.</i>

83
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,810
What the hell.

84
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,060
Let's go crazy.

85
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,370
Something smells good.

86
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,700
Honey?

87
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,910
Suzy?

88
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,390
Stay on the ground!
Stay on the ground.

89
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,470
Drop the knife!

90
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,200
Do not resist!
Stay on the ground!

91
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,610
Stay where you are!

92
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,440
Stay on the ground!

93
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,180
Don't move!

94
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,090
Move.

95
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,400
Get up against
the wall.

96
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,360
Scrub yourself.

97
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,600
Stop.

98
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,440
Prisoner will
step back.

99
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,840
Happy holidays.

100
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,100
They slipped.

101
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,040
Good morning.
Morning.

102
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,130
Morning, Warden.

103
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,240
Morning.

104
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,940
Good morning, ma'am.

105
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,540
Good morning.

106
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,450
There goes the baddest ass in the yard.

107
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,680
Sound like you're
in love, homie.

108
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,420
I am.

109
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,540
Damn. I had to
wake up for this?

110
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,340
All right, is it
my imagination,

111
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,280
or is this shit
getting worse?

112
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,180
Like, what is this
supposed to be?

113
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,510
Oatmeal.

114
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,750
I think.

115
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,550
Man, how do you
fuck up oatmeal?

116
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,120
Who's the new guy?

117
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,120
Jensen Ames.

118
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,290
The driver?

119
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,630
Never heard
of him.

120
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,390
Oh, yeah, I saw him race
years ago. He's good.

121
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,270
Did some time
upstate.

122
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,860
Killed his career.

123
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,500
Holder of the fastest laps
at Willard, Union and Butler.

124
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,270
I hope he's as fast off
the track as he is on.

125
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,790
Never a dull day.

126
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,570
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

127
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,250
Heads up.
It's Pachenko.

128
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,220
So you're the
wife killer.

129
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,040
Takes a big man
to kill a woman.

130
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,640
I suppose you
rape kiddies, too.

131
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,200
You hear that,
everyone?

132
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,110
Guy kills women.
Rapes kiddies.

133
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,280
What do you think we
ought to do about that?

134
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,030
Get down on the ground!
Down on the ground! Now!

135
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,190
Nobody move!

136
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,100
Nobody move!

137
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,130
I guess he didn't like
the oatmeal, either.

138
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,940
Well, you've
got stones.

139
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,810
Putting the hurt on
a Brotherhood general.

140
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,140
But right now, that's the
least of your problems.

141
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,520
The warden does bad things to people
that mix it up with the drivers.

142
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,010
Prisoner 77119, ma'am.

143
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,190
Thank you, Mr. Ulrich.

144
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,680
This prison is the
home to murderers,

145
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,420
rapists and violent
offenders of every kind.

146
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,500
The United States penal system
sends me the worst of the worst.

147
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,900
But the men
you've provoked...

148
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,730
Well, let's just
say, Mr. Ames,

149
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,270
that the life term
you joined us for

150
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,900
may be a lot shorter
than you think.

151
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,000
I understand.
Tradition.

152
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,810
Soften up the new guy.
An ass-slapping good time had by all.

153
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,520
Foul language
is an issue

154
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,960
for me.

155
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,370
While looking
over your record,

156
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,030
I couldn't help noticing
your occupational history.

157
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,510
It seems you have some
talent behind the wheel.

158
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,120
Out of curiosity, when was
the last time you raced?

159
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,320
It's been a while.
I lost my license.

160
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,020
What if I could
help you?

161
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,860
Get my license back?

162
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,460
I had something
else in mind.

163
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,740
You're familiar
with the Death Race

164
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,640
and the driver the
fans call Frankenstein?

165
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,540
A man so disfigured
by crashes

166
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,670
that he's forced
to wear a mask.

167
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,040
His return to the track
is highly anticipated,

168
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,280
and therein lies
my problem.

169
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,190
No one knows yet,
but poor Frank died

170
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,550
on an operating table not
long after his last race.

171
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,590
Anyone can
wear the mask.

172
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,320
But not just anyone
can drive the car.

173
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,860
You have the skills I require
to keep the legend alive.

174
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,140
I want you to become
Frankenstein.

175
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,980
No, thanks.

176
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,710
He's dead.

177
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,870
Why don't you just
tell the truth?

178
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,550
The audience wants
to see Frank again.

179
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,650
He moves them.
Inspires them.

180
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,730
And in this world, that's
not so easy to come by.

181
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,830
What makes you
think for a second

182
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,100
I would risk my life
doing this for you?

183
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,340
Win five races,

184
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,570
you go free.

185
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,710
Those are the rules.

186
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,380
And Frank
has won four.

187
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,180
Win one more,

188
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,950
you walk.

189
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,230
Call it intuition,
but...

190
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,490
I don't think you
belong in here

191
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,000
with the rest
of these animals.

192
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,570
I might surprise you.

193
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,460
The race is Friday, and
I need your decision.

194
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,630
Ten seconds from now,
I will retract this offer,

195
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,110
and extend it to Prisoner
68815, James Francis Barlini,

196
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,110
who, clearly not
of your caliber,

197
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,050
will be quite
enthusiastic about it.

198
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,880
And you, unfortunately, will need to
spend your incarceration in solitary.

199
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,890
Since now I know your
dirty little secret.

200
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,290
I'm sure you'll find
solitary preferable

201
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,460
to what Mr. Pachenko and his
friends have in mind for you.

202
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,930
You're a skilled driver.
Your chances are good.

203
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
I'm offering you your
freedom, Mr. Ames.

204
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,880
If it's not worth risking
your life for, what is?

205
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,180
All right, turn her up and tighten
the lines! She's hemorrhaging!

206
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,310
Ma'am.

207
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,550
You don't have to call me "ma'am."
You know that.

208
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,920
This is Mr. Ames.
You know why he's here.

209
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh, I do now.

210
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,260
The race is less
than a week away.

211
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,670
I have great
confidence in you.

212
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,300
Well, then, I'll leave
you two to get acquainted.

213
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,610
Jensen Garner Ames.
Moved to the States at 24 years old.

214
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,980
Named after a car,
the Jensen Interceptor.

215
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,520
A three-time local
speedway champion.

216
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,920
You've done your homework.
Or do you just know everything?

217
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Jensen Interceptor.
I had one.

218
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,720
Handled like
a school bus.

219
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,630
Call me Coach.
Everyone does.

220
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,190
Gunner. Lists.

221
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,490
This is Frank.

222
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,610
I'll show you around.

223
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,310
We have a fully
functioning auto shop,

224
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,570
just like you'd find
in the outside world.

225
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,050
Each team has
their own shop.

226
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,670
We don't help them.
They don't help us.

227
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,690
To the inmates, you're Jensen Ames,
the new grease monkey.

228
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,090
Nobody will know you're
Frank except us on the team

229
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,180
and a handful
of the guards.

230
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,320
Nobody will talk.

231
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,890
How can you
be so sure?

232
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:50,190
Hennessey. In here, she is
judge, jury and executioner.

233
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,500
The race is her baby.
Anyone who threatens it, she kills.

234
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,700
<i>The audience for
the race has halved</i>

235
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,830
<i>since Frank's been
out of the game,</i>

236
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,640
<i>and so has the
corporation's profit.</i>

237
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,770
<i>That's why she needs you.</i>

238
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,010
What's back there?

239
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,050
That's a good
question.

240
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,110
Hennessey's had a whole wing of
the prison in isolation for a month.

241
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,050
Working on
something.

242
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,750
Time to meet
the Monster.

243
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,060
Mustang V8 Fastback.

244
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,100
Took the best
and made it better.

245
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
That's a V8 Roush 5.4 liter
with a Ford Racing supercharger

246
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,580
putting out 850
horsepower and close to...

247
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,140
Seven hundred
pounds of torque

248
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,370
with sequential
multi-port fuel injection.

249
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,180
Looks like there's
a 250 hp NOS unit.

250
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,910
Just in case.

251
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,560
Then we had some fun customizing
your personal protection package.

252
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,620
Three-quarter inch steel
plate, front and sides.

253
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:00,330
Bulletproof glass will
be here, here and there.

254
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,900
And in the rear, a six-inch
solid steel shield we call

255
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,740
"the tombstone."

256
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,750
Oil, smoke, and
napalm for defense.

257
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,750
And twin 30-millimeter belt-fed
machine guns for offense.

258
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,260
So where's the ammo?

259
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,390
We get that
on race day.

260
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,590
Pity.

261
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,820
Yeah. Everyone thinks that, first time.

262
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,060
Thinks what?

263
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,530
About turning the guns on
the guards, about escaping.

264
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,870
No, I wasn't
thinking that.

265
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,560
Well, I'm glad,
because

266
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,270
Hennessey has got
electric kill switches

267
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,210
in all the guns
in all the cars.

268
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,830
And all the guard
towers are fortified,

269
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,540
and their guns are
bigger than your guns.

270
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,940
But did I mention
the helicopters,

271
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,720
and also the fact that
we're on an island here

272
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,550
a mile from the
nearest shoreline?

273
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,550
The only way in
or out of here

274
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,020
is on that one skinny
bridge you came in on.

275
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,270
What's that?

276
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,070
Most important
part of the car.

277
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,500
How many people
has Frank killed?

278
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,610
Twenty. The mortality rate
is average 62.2% per race.

279
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,420
So Frank beat the
odds four times.

280
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,950
Yeah. Till they
beat him.

281
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,400
The race takes place in
three stages over three days.

282
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,560
The first two stages,

283
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,660
you just got to try
and get rid of

284
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,760
as much of the competition as you can

285
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,160
while getting your own skinny
ass over the line alive.

286
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,060
Third stage is
where speed counts.

287
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,630
First one over
that line wins.

288
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,240
Tomorrow morning, you
meet your navigator, Case.

289
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,030
She'll help you navigate the
course, reload your weapons

290
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,040
and help with the
running of the car.

291
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,610
I'd like to talk to her ahead
of time, before the race.

292
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,980
Yeah. I'd like
a big-tittie girl

293
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,140
to lick peanut
butter off my toes.

294
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,680
That ain't gonna happen.

295
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,050
It's still a prison,
man. She's a chick.

296
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,060
They get bussed in from the
women's facility upstate.

297
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,020
It's all about ratings,
fast cars, pretty women.

298
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,060
Yeah, Machine Gun Joe is the only
one that has a male navigators.

299
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,360
'Cause he's gay.

300
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,090
Actually, it's 'cause he
goes through them so fast,

301
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,070
the audience
gets squeamish.

302
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,230
Yeah, he goes through them.
Through their ass.

303
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:55,640
He cuts each kill into his
skin as a souvenir, right here.

304
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,640
What about the rest of the drivers?

305
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,840
Lists?

306
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,450
14K.

307
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,380
<i>First generation Chinese-American,
10th generation Triad.</i>

308
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,750
And his father sent
him to business school.

309
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,570
He's the only man in here
who holds a degree from MIT.

310
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,110
He's killed four
men off the track.

311
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,300
That we know of.

312
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,850
Another seven
on it.

313
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,180
Hector Grimm,
The Grimm Reaper.

314
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,080
<i>The man's a master.
Clinical psychopath.</i>

315
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,020
Believes that Hennessey
is an avatar

316
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,850
of the Hindu goddess
of death, Kali,

317
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,450
and that he is
her messenger.

318
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,620
Cuckoo.

319
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,130
Three time
consecutive life sentences.

320
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,820
He's killed six men off
the track, another 12 on it.

321
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,530
You've already met the local
chapter of the Brotherhood.

322
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,720
<i>Their driver, Pachenko,
has killed nine men< on the track.</i>

323
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,120
Nobody knows
how many off.

324
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,560
Travis Colt,
our local superstar.

325
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,790
Used to race
for NASCAR.

326
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,960
Yeah, he was
good, too.

327
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,230
Until he fell asleep behind
the wheel of his Mercedes

328
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,960
<i>with the help of a bottle of
scotch and a handful of ludes.</i>

329
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,830
Wiped out the entire
patio of La Scala.

330
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,530
Sent a dozen people
to the hospital.

331
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,070
God damn it!

332
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,940
It killed three of them.

333
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,310
Technically the best
driver in here,

334
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,410
but a mean son
of a bitch within.

335
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,740
Ladies.

336
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,920
I hear your man Frank is still in the
infirmary with 15 unhealed fractures.

337
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,160
I also hear he's not
gonna make the race.

338
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,890
You hear a lot.

339
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,360
Who's the new fish?

340
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,630
Grease monkey.

341
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,330
Well, well. Monkey.

342
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,240
I got a new
name for you.

343
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,440
Igor.

344
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,010
'Cause you about the ugliest
motherfucker in this prison, yo.

345
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,520
Funny, huh?

346
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,830
You tell Frank
when you see him.

347
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:56,190
This race is between me and him.

348
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,860
This time won't
be no infirmary.

349
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,960
It'll be the morgue.

350
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,370
I'll be sure
to pass it on.

351
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,100
Let's get out
of here, man.

352
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,980
Man, that is
one angry homo.

353
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,550
Who are they?

354
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,860
Work detail.

355
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,620
Get to work on the
track for good behavior.

356
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,630
Those are GPS
tracking bracelets.

357
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,640
In case somebody
decides to go for a swim.

358
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,290
The ring.

359
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,590
This was the
old Frank's.

360
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,260
It kind of melted
to his hand.

361
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,150
Frankenstein!

362
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,200
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

363
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:14,030
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

364
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,760
Assholes.

365
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,730
He's all yours.

366
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,540
Don't talk to
the other drivers.

367
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,170
Frank never did.
Part of the mystique.

368
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,300
Let the mask
do the work.

369
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,360
Here comes trouble.

370
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,450
There's our girl.

371
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,060
I'm Case.

372
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,250
Frank.

373
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,660
Funny, you don't
sound like Frank.

374
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,590
Don't sweat it.
I know.

375
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,860
I drove with Frank.
I'll watch your back.

376
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,160
Better than you
watched his, I hope.

377
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:39,440
Still here. Well, I guess I
got to work a little harder.

378
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,580
Get back to your
car, prisoner.

379
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,790
You sure know how
to make friends.

380
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,820
Case. This is
mirrored glass.

381
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,020
No one can see in, so you
might want to take the mask off.

382
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,500
Unless you like
it under there.

383
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,230
How the hell did he
drive in that thing?

384
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,030
What?

385
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,010
You're better looking
than the last Frank.

386
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,050
A few crashes
should change that.

387
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,210
Start the transmission.

388
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,810
Three, two, one.

389
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,990

<i>He's the man that

410

Twelve million hits

411
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,020
He hasn't even
started the engine.

412
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,290
We'll do 45 million
viewers today.

413
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,070
So, what are
you in for?

414
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,960
They say
I killed a cop.

415
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,270
Did you do it?

416
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,130
Yeah.

417
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,140
Bad cop?

418
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,480
Good cop.

419
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,140
Lousy husband.

420
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,780
Frank, Case,
you read me?

421
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,480
<i>We hear you.</i>

422
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,820
<i>This is a three-lap race.</i>

423
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,520
Hennessey doesn't activate
the weapons till lap two.

424
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,500
<i>Now remember, it's first
come,< first served,</i>

425
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,290
<i>so it pays to
be out in front.</i>

426
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,840
This is it. Countdown.

427
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,220
You're sure
he can deliver?

428
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,110
Jog left to 100 feet.

429
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,440
50, 20...

430
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,240
Now!

431
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,720
Punch it! Hard
left up ahead.

432
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,870
He seems to be
handling himself.

433
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,190
Wakey-wakey!

434
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,220
We're being passed.
We've gotta catch up!

435
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,890
Man, I know
what I'm doing!

436
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,190
Hey, just leave
that motherfucker...

437
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,500
Shut up, man!

438
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,970
I know what the
hell I'm doing.

439
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,410
What you gonna do?

440
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,090
You can't go head-to-head
with Joe like this.

441
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,320
He'll tear you apart.

442
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,050
You read me?

443
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,330
Listen to him, before
you get us both killed.

444
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,630
Case, help him
out of there!

445
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,400
There's a shortcut
to the left.

446
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,770
There!

447
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,170
He's taking
the shortcut!

448
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,540
You don't think
I see that?

449
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,690
Activate swords
and shields.

450
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,320
The swords arm
the main guns.

451
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,450
Shields trigger the
napalm, oil and smoke.

452
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,030
I know. I've seen
this race before.

453
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,600
You think you know. It takes
the weight of the entire car.

454
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,390
You have to make contact with
all four tires simultaneously.

455
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,560
Anything else
I'm missing?

456
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,800
Don't get me started.

457
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,380
Activate death heads.

458
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,010
Death heads activated.

459
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:34,910
Feel it, baby!

460
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,810
Score another one
for the Reaper, baby.

461
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,310
Thank you.

462
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,180
Don't mention it.
Come on. All clear.

463
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,490
<i>Fuck you, puto!
Fuck you!</i>

464
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,670
We got guns.

465
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,680
Look out. Oil.

466
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,020
Damn!

467
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,830
<i>Your mother's a puta,
motherfucker!</i>

468
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,600
What the fuck?

469
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,870
We got to get
back in the race.

470
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:55,460
I'm the fucking
Reaper, baby.

471
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,030
Can't kill me.

472
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,600
<i>You can burn me.</i>

473
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,830
You can fucking shoot me, but you
just can't motherfucking kill me!

474
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,360
Get that off my window
when we get back.

475
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:20,570
We're streaming to 46
million viewers, ma'am.

476
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,110
Offensive weapons are up.

477
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,350
It's on.

478
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,580
Fuck.
It's jammed.

479
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,020
Cover me.

480
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,650
Jesus Christ!

481
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,560
Hold tight, Case!

482
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,200
I'm back.

483
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:08,660
Thank you.
My pleasure.

484
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,990
Shield up ahead!

485
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,890
That son of a bitch!

486
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,430
He just stole
a shield from Colt!

487
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,330
Defense weapons are on.

488
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,100
Let him have it.

489
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,440
The napalm won't fire!

490
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:28,740
Smoke.

491
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,280
No smoke? No oil?
No napalm?

492
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,250
Again?

493
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,290
Fuck, man.

494
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:50,930
Remember me, motherfucker?

495
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,440
Coach!

496
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:04,380
The tombstone won't take
much more of this.

497
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:08,810
<i>Frank, Case, those 50 caliber
shells will be through the tombstone</i>

498
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,010
<i>in a matter of seconds.</i>

499
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,820
My advice, either
lose him or kill him.

500
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,630
Unhook the napalm.

501
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,330
Get on my lap.

502
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,410
What?

503
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:30,630
Get on my lap.

504
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,490
What the hell?

505
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,100
Merry Christmas, asshole!

506
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,430
Oh, shit!

507
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,360
Nice work.

508
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,480
Where's he going?

509
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,280
A shortcut. Punch it.
We can beat him.

510
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,270
Look out!

511
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:20,580
<i>Grimm, Colt and Siad are gone.
Six remaining drivers alive.</i>

512
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:22,980
<i>Subscribe to Stage 2 now!</i>

513
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,140
We have 14 hours,
gentlemen, so let's get to work.

514
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,000
Starting with this.

515
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,170
So what happened
out there, Case?

516
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,510
He got distracted.

517
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,080
He got distracted?

518
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,050
Coach!

519
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,220
What?

520
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:04,130
Look at this.
The oil sprayers work fine.

521
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,960
Well, I'll
be damned.

522
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,410
Stop.

523
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,310
Last place.

524
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,010
It's too bad.

525
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,440
Look on the
bright side.

526
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,490
Everyone loves
a comeback.

527
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,010
What can I do for
you, Mr. Ames?

528
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,820
You sure are lucky
a driver like me

529
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:02,020
just happened to turn up
in your prison when I did.

530
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:04,100
Oh, I'm more
than lucky.

531
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:06,660
I'm blessed.

532
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:08,600
Sometimes it's like
the right hand of God

533
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,930
is sitting on
my shoulder.

534
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,000
I'm not racing tomorrow.

535
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,310
Go fuck yourself.

536
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:20,610
Wait.

537
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,620
Take his shackles off.

538
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:40,660
Please excuse us,
Mr. Ulrich.

539
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,000
And take Mr. James
with you.

540
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,820
Do you recognize
these people?

541
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,850
Because your
daughter will.

542
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,950
They're her
new parents.

543
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,360
What's her name?

544
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,220
Piper.

545
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,530
That's the man she'll
grow up calling Daddy.

546
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:18,810
Unless you do
something about it.

547
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,610
Where is she now?

548
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:26,150
Oh, I'm sure I have her
address around here somewhere.

549
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:28,980
You're a smart man,
Mr. Ames.

550
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:33,010
Play my game, we both go home happy.

551
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,480
The man who killed my
wife is in this prison.

552
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:42,420
I wonder what he'll say
when I ask him why he did it.

553
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:46,300
Why don't you look
in a mirror? Ask him.

554
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:52,000
Poor Piper. It must be hard
growing up with that knowledge.

555
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,570
That your father
killed your mother.

556
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,060
You wanted a monster.

557
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,160
Well, you've got one.

558
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,790
She has your eyes.

559
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,150
Her mother's.

560
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,000
So why don't you wear
a number, Coach?

561
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,260
Because I'm
not a prisoner.

562
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:58,700
I qualified for parole
three years ago.

563
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:02,100
Got as far
as the gate.

564
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,770
They got a name for it,
something-or-other syndrome.

565
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:12,250
The simple fact is, the world's
changed since I've been in here.

566
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:15,650
Don't know it.
Don't much want to. But this?

567
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:18,620
This I know.

568
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,320
- What did they send you away for?
- Oh, plenty.

569
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,500
And nothing.

570
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,290
To what do we owe the
pleasure of your company?

571
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:29,960
I killed my wife.

572
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,360
Bullshit.

573
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:36,470
You're a hard man, but
you ain't no wife killer.

574
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,670
How do you know?

575
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,270
I've met my share.

576
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,240
But you, the way
you looked at her...

577
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:47,310
You couldn't do that if
you'd killed her mother. So...

578
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,190
I say bullshit.

579
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:56,420
Coach.

580
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,890
What would you say if I told
you Hennessey had my wife killed

581
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:04,990
and me framed for it

582
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:08,470
so she could bring me in
here to be her Frankenstein?

583
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,140
What would you say
to that bullshit?

584
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,410
Her name was Suzy.

585
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:24,480
I was always headed
here. Always knew.

586
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,530
She didn't.

587
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,990
She was my chance
at something else.

588
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,540
And that bitch took
her away from me.

589
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:00,020
"...that thy days may
be long upon the land

590
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,190
"which the Lord thy...
Giveth thee.

591
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:31,260
"Thou shalt not...

592
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:35,990
"kill."

593
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,280
You should take a break.
Get some sleep.

594
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,010
I'm okay, Lists.

595
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:03,280
Concentration
for the race.

596
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:07,090
Concentration, that's what you need.
Gotta get your rest.

597
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,830
Maybe you're right.

598
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,240
I will take that
break after all.

599
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,280
Good call.

600
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:28,340
Guy can't grind
for shit.

601
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,400
Move!

602
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,270
Looking for me?

603
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,950
Hold him.

604
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,760
You killed my wife.

605
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,870
Well, now, maybe I did.

606
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,040
I don't care if
the queen bitch

607
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,610
wants to save you
for the track.

608
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:35,680
Nobody disrespects the
Brotherhood and lives.

609
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:39,110
Put him down.

610
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:42,950
I'm going to
take your head.

611
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:04,190
What the fuck!

612
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:03,210
Hennessey made me
do it. Ulrich...

613
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,590
Ulrich too.

614
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,620
Let me go, man.

615
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,290
I'll do anything.

616
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,930
You're going
to die here.

617
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,800
Fuck you!

618
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:43,040
Now, now, boys.

619
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:45,630
Let's save that
for the track, huh?

620
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,490
Coach!

621
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:13,040
Take a look at this.

622
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,980
What the hell were
they building in here?

623
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,460
We'll find
out soon enough.

624
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,930
Prisoner!

625
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,440
It's time to get ready.

626
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:00,400

644
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,350
What's he doing?

645
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:34,300
He's dropping back.
He's not even trying to race.

646
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,590
We're gonna have
a little talk.

647
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:42,070
We're gonna be done by the
time we leave the tunnel.

648
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,270
Did you kill
the old Frank?

649
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,600
What?

650
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:48,440
Tunnel comes up fast.

651
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:52,240
Remember what happened
to the napalm canister?

652
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,590
Be a real shame for
that to happen to you.

653
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:04,090
Did you kill
the old Frank?

654
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,630
I sabotaged his
rear weapons.

655
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:09,820
Why?

656
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:12,390
Hennessey.

657
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:16,170
She said she'd sign my release
papers. It's my life back.

658
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:17,970
I'd have killed
him, too.

659
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:19,470
I didn't kill him!

660
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,570
He wouldn't quit. I just wanted
to make sure he didn't win.

661
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,410
Why would Hennessey
want that?

662
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,010
To keep Frank
here, racing.

663
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,950
And yesterday?

664
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:32,450
She wanted me
to set you back.

665
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,290
So I'm not supposed
to win, either.

666
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:37,880
Just make it exciting.

667
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:46,530
That's all
I wanted to know.

668
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:50,540
Hold tight.

669
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,860
Come on!
Just come on through!

670
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:32,510
Damn!

671
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,820
He's going
after Pachenko.

672
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,660
Sword and shield
ahead. Take defense.

673
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:22,530
No.

674
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,230
There's someone
I need to kill.

675
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:30,530
You're out in front.

676
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,200
Who are you going
to shoot at?

677
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,810
You're a dead man!

678
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,480
I told you to
take defense!

679
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:00,430
He's too heavily
armored!

680
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,100
Fuck!

681
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,670
Hit the smoke.

682
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,960
This is a race.
You don't go backwards.

683
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,440
And you don't get
out of the car.

684
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,820
It was Hennessey.
Hennessey.

685
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:32,490
I know. She's next.

686
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:49,040
I got it. Frank's
out of his car.

687
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:50,480
What?

688
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:51,880
He stepped out
of his car.

689
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:53,850
Okay. I see him.
I need guns.

690
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:56,440
Yes. Sword coming
up in 50 yards.

691
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:01,820
What happened?
I don't know.

692
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:03,450
Somebody must
have grabbed it.

693
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,990
What do you mean,
somebody grabbed it?

694
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:07,820
Look, man.
I thought it was lit.

695
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:09,800
What do you mean,
you thought?

696
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,730
Man, get the fuck
out of my car.

697
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:12,960
What?

698
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:15,630
I said, get the fuck
out of my car!

699
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:33,920
Oh, hell, no!
Come on, man.

700
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:36,620
Listen, we got...
Wait! Wait! Wait!

701
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:39,220
Wait! Wait! It ain't my turn!
It's not what I do.

702
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:40,760
Get in there.

703
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:45,030
Don't let me
down, boy.

704
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,450
Release the Dreadnought.

705
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:12,690
Coach?

706
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,030
Oh.

707
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:26,200
Well, I guess we know
what she was building now.

708
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:35,780
Activate weapons.

709
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:51,400
Jesus Christ!

710
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,370
Coach, any ideas?

711
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:29,960
You just have to
tough it out, I guess.

712
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:33,940
Hennessey will take it off after
she's pumped up the ratings.

713
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,910
You sure
about that?

714
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:59,730
Where the hell is
that thing going?

715
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,700
Fuck me.

716
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:22,350
<i>Lists.</i>

717
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:24,150
Receiving.

718
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:26,350
I want you to patch me
through to another car.

719
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,650
On it.

720
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,890
<i>Joe?</i>

721
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:37,020
Who is this?

722
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,960
It's Frank.
What do you want?

723
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:41,540
How about we play
a little offense?

724
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:46,370
I hope you know
what you're doing.

725
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:09,420
Now that's entertainment!

726
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,690
Damn it!

727
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,730
Frankenstein!
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

728
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,370
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

729
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:29,740
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

730
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:45,120
Nice reflexes
there, Igor.

731
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:49,690
Race car reflexes.

732
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:53,260
You look lost, pal.

733
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,390
Not this time.

734
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:00,470
I got this feeling that
you and Frank are close.

735
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,440
Real close.

736
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:07,070
That weird accent.
You even kind of sound alike.

737
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:11,750
I was wondering, what
if you got in a accident?

738
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:16,750
Would that throw Frank
off his game a little bit?

739
01:19:17,290 --> 01:19:18,690
I doubt it,

740
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,430
sick, fucked-up
guy that he is.

741
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:25,200
He might just
want to kill you.

742
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,590
That's cool.

743
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,740
So I guess I'll
see him later.

744
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,070
Right?

745
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,850
Let's roll.

746
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,030
Ma'am, with all respect,
what are we going to do?

747
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:06,840
We're going to kill
him, of course.

748
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,530
You want me to
kill Frankenstein?

749
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,170
Don't be stupid.

750
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,470
Frankenstein
can't die.

751
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:14,740
After all,
he's just a mask.

752
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:45,880
Tonight is the
final leg of the Death Race,

753
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:49,470
and perhaps a new
champion will arise.

754
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:51,850
A five times winner.

755
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:56,460
The first man ever
to gain his freedom.

756
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:02,460
The world gave you to me because
you were not fit to be a part of it.

757
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:05,430
You were not fit
to be husbands,

758
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,700
you were not fit
to be fathers,

759
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:13,860
and were too dangerous to
live with the rest of us.

760
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,710
What is this
shit, man?

761
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:19,980
But when you race tonight,

762
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,350
know that the eyes of
the world are upon you.

763
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:53,880
And know that the very same
world which rejected you

764
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:56,850
now lives and
breathes with you.

765
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:01,490
And it draws inspiration
from your courage.

766
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,290
No one is ever gonna
win five races.

767
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:06,590
So race well...

768
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,420
Nobody is ever
getting out of here.

769
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:12,230
...and know that I
consider you all my heroes.

770
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:26,810
I want to show
you something.

771
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,320
<i>Can't kill me.
Can't kill me. I'm the fucking Reaper.</i>

772
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:38,190
<i>You can burn me.</i>

773
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:41,990
<i>You can shoot me.
But you can't motherfucking...</i>

774
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,290
There.

775
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,240
Gunner, Lists.

776
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,320
Will Hennessey's
inspectors care

777
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,510
if we had a half
gallon reserve tank?

778
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,250
Another half gallon?

779
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,790
You got a fuel tank
that holds 35 gallons.

780
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:11,760
What the hell you want
another half gallon for?

781
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:13,450
Coach?

782
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:16,000
Let's give the man
what he wants.

783
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:21,000
Hey, where are
you going?

784
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,140
Oh, this is
not good.

785
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:47,160
Real brave,
coming over here.

786
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:57,030
I'm going to win this race,
'cause I want out of this shithole.

787
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,440
I've already won
three races.

788
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:04,270
Two more, and I'm
smoking Cohibas in Miami.

789
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:10,950
Frank might want
to think about that.

790
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:12,880
'Cause I'm gone.

791
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,950
Out of here.

792
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:18,290
Then maybe
it's his turn.

793
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:21,420
Maybe he's thinking it's
the other way around.

794
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:29,630
From here on out, you stay
the fuck out of my pit.

795
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:40,110
Hey.

796
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:45,980
Thinking you and Frank
should have a little talk.

797
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:53,920
<i>Welcome to the final
installment of Death Race.</i>

798
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,190
<i>Seven men dead.</i>

799
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,600

805
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,980
<i>Just Frankenstein and
Machine Gun Joe survive.</i>

806
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,480
<i>Frank, racing for
his freedom.</i>

807
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:16,550
<i>Joe, doing anything
to stop him.</i>

808
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:19,990
<i>It's mano y mano,
and there will be no mercy.</i>

809
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:23,920
<i>Tonight, only one man will
walk off this track alive.</i>

810
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:27,660
<i>A record 70 million are
already watching. Join them.</i>

811
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,390
<i>Subscribe to the
final stage now.</i>

812
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:36,170
It's an honor to navigate for you, sir.

813
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:37,900
They call me...
Save it.

814
01:25:38,010 --> 01:25:40,670
We won't have time
to get acquainted.

815
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:45,400
What the
hell are those?

816
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:48,780
Model 7 Russian
states armory RPG's.

817
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:53,080
Armor-piercing, self-arming,
accurate to 1,000 yards.

818
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,490
That's what
I thought.

819
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,170
Prisoner, step back.

820
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:18,040
I thought maybe you could
use a little inspiration.

821
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:21,280
Your release papers.

822
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,210
They're already
signed.

823
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,580
All you have to do is
walk off that track alive.

824
01:26:27,690 --> 01:26:30,390
Well, and win,
of course.

825
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:41,360
But if you do win,

826
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:44,170
I want you to think
about staying here.

827
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:46,530
As Frankenstein.

828
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,040
With me.

829
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,710
Yeah.

830
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:54,150
I can see the appeal.

831
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,210
What would you do
with your freedom?

832
01:26:58,990 --> 01:27:00,680
Go back to
your daughter?

833
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:02,150
That's the idea.

834
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:04,560
The thing is,

835
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:07,690
are you really the best
future she could possibly have?

836
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:11,860
Are you really
daddy material?

837
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:14,030
Or deep down, are
you something else?

838
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:24,040
If you decided that out there on
that track is where you belong,

839
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:29,080
it would be the most unselfish
act of love I've ever seen.

840
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,590
Just something
to think about.

841
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,690
What's this?

842
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:20,530
Small modification.

843
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,900
So Hennessey tells me if you're going
to win, I'm supposed to stop you.

844
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:27,700
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

845
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,440
Sounds like the odds
are stacked against us.

846
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:34,540
Then do what
you do best.

847
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:38,050
Drive.

848
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,430
Gentlemen, this should be interesting.

849
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:18,320
Lit sword up ahead.

850
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:20,290
Deactivate that.
Sir?

851
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,860
Just do it.

852
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:24,990
Switch it back on.

853
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,260
Weapons are up!

854
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:28,640
Damn it!

855
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,470
Shit.

856
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,880
Lit shield up ahead!

857
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:49,010
Damn it!

858
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,090
What happened?

859
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:52,130
Hennessey must have
deactivated it. Bitch!

860
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:00,630
Light me up.

861
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,100
It's party time.

862
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:41,840
Coach, we gotta
get the firepower.

863
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:43,710
Nothing lit
for a half lap.

864
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:45,870
We won't last that long!

865
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:25,240
Drop the tombstone.

866
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:26,410
What?

867
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:27,880
Do it!

868
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,920
On my mark. Three,

869
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:37,520
two,

870
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:39,890
one!

871
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:43,100
Mark.

872
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:48,070
Damn it!

873
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:51,800
That shit don't
work twice, playboy!

874
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,150
Shit.

875
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:02,220
Lit shield in
quarter lap.

876
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,220
Do you hear that?
Lit shield in the quarter lap.

877
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,640
He's coming up fast.

878
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:26,650
Let them get the shield.
Keep the viewers interested.

879
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:38,680
Son of a bitch!
He got the shield!

880
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:46,260
Arm the explosive.

881
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:48,560
Just in case.

882
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,270
Yo, Frankenfreak.

883
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,110
This villager's
got a pitchfork,

884
01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:00,480
and it's headed
straight up your ass.

885
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,770
What just happened?

886
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:37,550
Yeah! Yeah, Frank!

887
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:42,220
They're off the track.
They're escaping.

888
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,790
They're headed
for the bridge.

889
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:46,450
Their weapons.
Hit the kill switches.

890
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:52,460
Seventy million viewers,
ma'am. They're all watching.

891
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:53,590
Shut the webcast down.

892
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:54,730
Shut it down!

893
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,900
Shut the fucking
computers down now!

894
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:02,970
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Now!

895
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,310
Get out! Get out!

896
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:05,570
Get out! Get out!

897
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:12,950
Yo, Frankenstein.

898
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:14,990
<i>It's good we had
that little talk.</i>

899
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:20,790
We gave that bitch
a good show, huh?

900
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,530
Give me that!

901
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:32,530
Okay, cocksucker,
fuck with me,

902
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,610
and we'll see who
shits on the sidewalk.

903
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,710
Somebody's mad
right now.

904
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:43,050
Nobody fucks
with my car.

905
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,620
Son of a bitch!

906
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:47,950
Get the choppers
in the air!

907
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,180
Come on. Off the ground. Go, go, go!

908
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:11,270
So what's your
real name?

909
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:13,440
I don't have the
time for small talk.

910
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:15,980
Just want to know
who I'm riding with.

911
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:21,910
Jensen Ames.

912
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:25,390
Like...
Like the car.

913
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:26,590
Like the car.

914
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:31,290
Well, Jensen Ames,
I hope you got a plan,

915
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:33,530
'cause it's not like we're
going to get very far.

916
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:34,830
You're right.

917
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:36,470
We won't.

918
01:35:45,630 --> 01:35:47,720
Now would be
a good time.

919
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:10,090
Very nice modification.

920
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:14,880
<i>That extra half
gallon reserve tank</i>

921
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:17,020
<i>should see you through
to the finish.</i>

922
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:20,220
<i>Bon voyage, Frank.</i>

923
01:36:52,530 --> 01:36:54,460
Choppers have
a visual, ma'am.

924
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:08,600
Good luck, Joe.

925
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:28,600
Get me a pilot.
I need to talk to a pilot right now.

926
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:30,190
Okay. You're on.

927
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:31,730
Stay with Frankenstein!
Don't lose him.

928
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:41,980
Sure you're
up for this?

929
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,140
I'm sure.

930
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,540
I owe it to Frank.

931
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:47,340
Besides, Hennessey already
gave me my release papers.

932
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:49,580
They have to let me out.

933
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,490
They've stopped
him, ma'am.

934
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:38,060
<i>Keep your hands
where we can see them.</i>

935
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:40,260
<i>You are under arrest!</i>

936
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:44,130
<i>I repeat, keep your hands
where we can see them!</i>

937
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:46,170
<i>You are under arrest!</i>

938
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:54,540
Hey, Igor.
Merry Christmas.

939
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:06,550
Come on. Let's
get out of here.

940
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:31,710
Nice.

941
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:34,710
The fact you have
duds like these

942
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:36,250
might make someone
question your...

943
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:37,380
My taste?

944
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:38,750
Yeah. So to speak.

945
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:40,920
I don't know about you,
but I'm headed to Miami.

946
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:42,650
Miami's good.

947
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,530
I'll meet you
down there.

948
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,860
Once I got my baby girl.

949
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:58,500
It's a shame I didn't get to
take care of that bitch Hennessey.

950
01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:01,240
Yeah. That is a shame.

951
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:14,820
Frankenstein has
been retrieved.

952
01:41:14,930 --> 01:41:17,990
And, ma'am, ratings
are off the charts.

953
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:22,230
Gifts and congratulations
are already coming in.

954
01:41:24,230 --> 01:41:25,830
You win again.

955
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:27,800
Mr. Ulrich,

956
01:41:30,010 --> 01:41:31,630
I always win.

957
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:35,410
Damn.

958
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:44,850
I love this game.

959
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:17,480
So we had to fix this car?

960
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:20,420
How many times we gonna
keep doing this, man?

961
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,460
This car is not
gonna start.

962
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,190
Damn it!

963
01:42:27,630 --> 01:42:30,460
You say you want me to live
the life of an honest man, huh?

964
01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:32,970
Yep. You better
get used to it.

965
01:42:38,910 --> 01:42:40,000
Hey, Igor.

966
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:45,930
Think we got
a little company.

967
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:30,100
What took you so long?

968
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:32,370
Had trouble getting my
release papers approved.

969
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:35,470
Wait here. There's
someone I want you to meet.

970
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:41,280
Look at her.

971
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,980
She has beautiful eyes.

972
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:45,520
They're her mother's.

973
01:43:45,630 --> 01:43:47,420
Where'd you get the rims?

974
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:49,430
I won it.
Card game.

975
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:50,850
Yeah, right.

976
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,020
No, really.

977
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:53,990
How many horsepower's in this engine?

978
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:55,830
Five hundred.

979
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:58,000
You sure
about that?

980
01:43:58,140 --> 01:43:59,800
<i>Someone
once asked me,</i>

981
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:02,530
<i>did I think I was the best
future for my little girl?</i>

982
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:06,310
<i>Something I've thought
about for a long time.</i>

983
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:08,710
<i>This is what I decided.</i>

984
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:13,450
<i>No one in this world is perfect.
Heaven knows I'm not.</i>

985
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:18,490
<i>But I love her more than
anyone else possibly could.</i>

986
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:22,390
<i>In the end, that's
all that matters.</i>

987
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:26,690
<i>She's my chance at something else.
Something better.</i>

988
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,500
<i>And there's no way
I'm letting go of that.</i>

989
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:30,770
<i>Okay, cocksucker, fuck with me,</i>

990
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,910
<i>and we'll see who
shits on the sidewalk.</i>
