2
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,100
Die ...

3
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,700
you ... son of a bitch!

4
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,700
Jamie ...

5
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
I want you to stay in the car.

6
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,300
Jamie!

7
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,800
Get away!
- Don't touch him, Jamie!

8
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,100
That's him.

9
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,500
Don't hit the girl.

10
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,200
Get down!

11
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,600
I don't get it, what happened?

12
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
He's gotta be down there!

13
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,700
Do it!

14
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,100
Stand back!

15
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,100
Quiet, Tuki.

16
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,400
Be quiet!

17
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,600
There's nothing out there, Tuki.

18
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,800
No.

19
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,700
No!

20
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Come on, Jamie.
Your bath is ready.

21
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,600
No!

22
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,800
Jamie! No!

23
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,900
It's all right.

24
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,900
It's all right, darling.

25
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,100
Oh, Jamie.

26
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,600
Jamie ...

27
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Jamie!

28
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,300
It's just another one of your nightmares, that's all!

29
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Oh ...
Oh.

30
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, darling. Look at me, look at me.

31
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Do you want me to call your mom?

32
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,700
Oh!

33
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,400
Oh, Jamie.
Jamie.

34
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,300
I'll call the doctor.

35
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,800
Oh, Jamie!

36
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,600
Oh, Jamie!

37
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,400
Jamie!
Doctor!

38
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,100
Get a gurney!

39
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,800
Somebody!

40
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,800
Come on!
- Okay.

41
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,800
Yeah. It's ready.

42
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,500
Go! ... Go!
- Jamie ...

43
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,500
... breathe!

44
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,200
Breathe, Jamie!

45
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,900
Jamie, breathe.

46
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,400
Prep e.r.! Tracheotomy. Go!
- No!

47
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,900
Hang on, Jamie. Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

48
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,800
All right, down.
- There you go.

49
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,400
Easy, easy, easy, doc.

50
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
You got her up there?
- Yeah. Steady, steady.

51
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,400
She needs oxygen!

52
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,900
All right, unstrap her.

53
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,000
All right.

54
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,100
No!

55
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,900
No!
- What are you doing?

56
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,400
Leave her!
- This girl is dying!

57
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,700
I have to open her trachea, for God's sake!
- She will stabilize.
- She's dying!

58
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,900
No.

59
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Do you see?

60
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,000
I see you still want this girl dead.

61
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,500
She has something to tell us.

62
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,200
Hey there, funny face.

63
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,300
What?

64
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Thank you.

65
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,300
Hey! Hey, open up!

66
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,900
Max!

67
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,300
Max!

68
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,200
They don't allow Max in here.
- Get in there, Max.

69
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,200
You know.

70
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,600
You know what they can do if they can't take a joke.

71
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,600
She doesn't even remember.

72
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,300
Is she really better?

73
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

74
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,700
Give me some of this action, baby.

75
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
What?

76
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,400
I wonder what Rachel's hiding
behind door number three.

77
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,300
It looks so good. It'll be so cute.

78
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,400
Billy ...

79
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,600
... is going to have to fight off a lot of boys.
- Billy is gonna freak.

80
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
What is going on here?

81
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,700
Gee. I'm sorry.

82
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,200
Come on, Max. Here.

83
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,100
Bye, sweetie, love you.

84
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,500
I'll be back in two days ... okay?

85
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,000
Mom and dad send their love.

86
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,400
How could they?

87
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,200
When are they gonna realize that she is not him?
She's just a child.

88
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,100
They know that Michael Myers is her uncle.

89
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,000
And that she attacked her stepmother.
That's why they fear her.

90
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,300
Especially on Halloween.

91
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,400
I never should've let my parents talk me into leaving.

92
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,200
I don't know, what I was thinking.

93
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,700
You are afraid and ..
- I am not.

94
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,100
You're afraid the whole thing might start ...
to happen again.

95
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,800
There's nothing wrong with being afraid.

96
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,600
And I suppose there's nothing wrong
with just leaving my little stepsister here alone.

97
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,800
You can telephone her from the cabin.

98
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
She'll be properly looked after.

99
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,100
Then why do I still feel guilty?

100
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,100
I'm worried about Jamie.
- So, stick around.

101
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,300
I already promised my parents.
- Promises were made to be broken, babe. - I don't know.

102
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,600
The farm's parties always rock. Think about it.
- Okay. -  I gotta jet. Bye.
- Bye.

103
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,500
I'll be back with the outfits.
- See you, Tina.

104
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,200
Max!

105
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,200
Max, what is it?

106
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,800
Come on, Max.

107
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,400
Oh, come on.

108
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,800
Come on, Max!

109
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,600
Come on.

110
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,800
Yes.

111
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,000
Here. You want this?
- That's mine.

112
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,700
I want the green one.
- I used to like this. - Here is the red one.

113
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,100
I don't want the scissors.
- It's mine.

114
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,100
I got the hook on them.

115
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
Shut up, Max!

116
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
It's a joke.

117
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,900
Jamie?
- Max!

118
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Max?

119
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,700
What'd she say?
- Okay.

120
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,300
All right!

121
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,700
Hold on a minute!

122
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,900
All right!

123
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,300
I'm coming!

124
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,000
Hello?

125
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,200
Are you all right?

126
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was just in the shower.

127
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,900
Is ... is Max all right?

128
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,500
Max is having fun.
He's been barking at a cat all morning.

129
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,700
Go and check him.

130
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Well, why?
- Go and check him, now!

131
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,700
All right.

132
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,800
All right. Hold on.
I have to go downstairs.

133
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,200
Oh, brother.

134
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Rachel?

135
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,700
<i>Dr. Loomis ...</i>

136
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,800
Max is gone.

137
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,600
Listen to me.

138
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,200
<i>Drop the phone, go to the nearest store.
Get out of the house.
Quickly! Now. Go on!</i>

139
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,200
Mr. Cornet!

140
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,700
Better find that out.

141
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
All clear. Nothing above, nothing below.

142
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,500
What about Max?

143
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
A dobie, right?

144
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,400
This is not happening to me.
Max!

145
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,000
Max, what have you done?

146
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm so embarrassed.
- That's what we're here for.

147
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,800
Rescue cats. - Find dogs.
- That's our job. - And we love it.

148
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,600
Think so.

149
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,000
<i>Bye, sweetie.
I love you.</i>

150
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,700
<i>You be a good girl.</i>

151
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,900
<i>Bye.</i>

152
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,100
So, she was perfectly all right.

153
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,400
Come on, Billy.

154
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,900
I think Jamie needs to get some rest.

155
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,900
Jamie, are y-you okay?

156
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,500
Come on.

157
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,100
You sense something, don't you?

158
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,900
Tell me.

159
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,700
Tell me what you know!

160
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,100
Here, write. Write! Write!

161
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,700
Write, what you know.

162
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,700
Jamie, please!

163
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,900
Please.

164
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,900
Yeah.

165
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,500
Max?

166
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Max?

167
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,000
No!

168
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,500
The tetanea should've taken effect by now.
Another dose might stop her heart.

169
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,200
She was shaking!

170
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Her whole body was shaking!

171
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,300
Every time a little girl twitches,
I'm supposed to call out the National Guard.

172
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,000
How many people did he kill last year?
Have you forgotten?

173
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,900
Your own daughter. - I don't.
- No! Of course you don't forget!

174
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,900
How could you?

175
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,900
But you never looked into his face, did you?

176
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,900
You never saw his eyes.

177
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,500
You never saw that ...

178
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,900
... nothing ...

179
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,600
No expression.

180
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,900
Blank.

181
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,000
My memory goes back 12 years ...

182
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,700
to the night when I offered ...

183
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,700
I'm gonna show you.

184
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,200
Show you something.
Look, look. Look at this.

185
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Look at that.

186
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,100
I prayed ...

187
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,400
That he would burn ... in hell.

188
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,700
But in my heart ...

189
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,700
I knew that hell would not have him.

190
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,300
Sheriff?

191
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
They want you down at the cemetery.

192
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,100
Rache?

193
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,100
Rache?

194
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,400
Maxie!

195
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,100
Chill out, Max.

196
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I'll get your water in a second.

197
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Rache?

198
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,700
Rachel?

199
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,000
Rachel? Rachel?

200
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,700
Rachel. I got you a present.

201
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,400
Rachel!

202
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,800
Rachel?

203
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,300
Rachel!

204
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Rachel?

205
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,900
Gonna miss you, baby!

206
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,800
Sammy!

207
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,100
It's Halloween, right?
- Can you believe we have this whole house
to ourselves for the weekend?

208
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,000
But Tina, that's what you've said before, remember?

209
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Oh, Sammy, are all your circuits on hold or what?

210
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,500
Tina, I thought Rachel was lurking around.

211
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,800
Oh, I did too ...

212
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,300
But I guess she decided to go up to the
country with her parents.

213
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,600
Oh, Max!
Shut your canine trap!

214
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,800
What if my mom calls and finds out ...

215
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,400
... Rachel's not here with us, huh?

216
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,100
Just joking!

217
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,100
Sammy, why don't you bag spitz tonight?

218
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,000
I couldn't do that.- Oh, sure you could.
- Oh, no, I can't.

219
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,800
Come on. Ooh, you're blushing.

220
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Come on.

221
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,900
Come on. You can't hide anything from me.

222
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,200
Come on.
- This may be it.

223
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,400
"It"?

224
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,800
What are you saying?

225
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,400
I can't talk to you about this.
- Oh, come on.

226
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,000
Come on. I mean, you're planning something.
What are we talking here like ...

227
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,300
candles and ...

228
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,500
... and a ...

229
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
sensual massage and ...

230
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,200
leopard sheets.

231
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,600
Satin.

232
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,800
Satin sheets?
- They're Rachel's!

233
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,100
I just flipped my skirt!

234
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,300
What do you want me to do?
What can I do? What can I do? I mean ...

235
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,200
Do you wanna make up signals or something?
- Enough!

236
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,300
What? Come on.
You guys can have the house to yourselves.

237
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,800
It's cool.

238
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,700
Mikey and I like it in the car.

239
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Oh, honey. Don't worry about it.
- I'm not worried.

240
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,000
I've just been in
a weird mood all day.

241
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,900
Everybody in this town is in a weird mood.

242
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,700
They should ban Halloween in this town.

243
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,200
Michael!

244
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
What?!

245
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,800
Hi.

246
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,900
Hey, you're just in time to give us a ride.

247
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,200
Come on, Sammy.
He's sorry about last weekend.

248
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,700
Aren't you, Mikey?

249
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,800
No.

250
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,300
See?

251
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,900
Tina, I thought you wanted to see Jamie.

252
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,000
Look, you're killing me, babe.

253
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,200
Would you just get in?

254
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,100
We can go later, right Mikey?

255
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,000
Right?

256
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
It's all right.

257
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,200
It's all right.

258
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,000
What are you doing down here?

259
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,000
Come on. Come on. It's okay.
- There you are.

260
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,500
We've been looking all over for you.

261
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
Come to me, baby.

262
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,600
Come on.

263
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,300
What happened?

264
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,900
Was it one of your dreams again?

265
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Okay, come on.

266
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,300
You gotta help me, Jamie.

267
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
You gotta help me to find him.

268
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,400
We both know he's alive.

269
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,200
But you know where he is!

270
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,100
Why?

271
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,000
Why are you protecting him?

272
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,700
Why?

273
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,700
What about your stepmother, Jamie?

274
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,100
You love her, don't you?
He made you stab her.

275
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,500
You cannot hide from him.
He'll always get to you.

276
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
Jamie.
Jamie, listen.

277
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,600
Today in the cemetery ...

278
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,800
... somebody dug up a coffin.

279
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,300
It was a coffin of a nine-year-old girl.

280
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,200
What do you think he's going to do with that?!

281
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,700
You're nine years old ...

282
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,900
... aren't you, Jamie?

283
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,500
Dr. Loomis ...

284
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
Leave the little girl alone.

285
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,000
Tears won't get you anywhere.

286
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,700
Help me to find him.

287
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,800
We'll find him together!

288
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,600
There's a reason, why he has this power over you.

289
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,000
Did you ever wonder what it is?

290
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,900
Baby?

291
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
He's still inside.

292
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,500
Okay.
- Excuse me.

293
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,300
Where is the bus stop for Chicago?
- Let's see, are you going to the Blooming Hill?

294
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,500
Michael?

295
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,000
Have you come home ...

296
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,500
... Michael?

297
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,300
I know what you want from her.

298
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,400
Don't you like the mask just a little bit?

299
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,200
Yeah, maybe you don't even need to wear a mask, baby.

300
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,200
* Baby, I'm yours *

301
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,100
* Baby, I'm ready *

302
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,300
Bruised, but ready.

303
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,000
Hi.

304
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,400
Friends of yours?

305
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,400
So, how many cases can we get?
- Three cases.

306
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Any more, I think old Mr. Casey
would know something's up.

307
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,100
But we gotta get going.
Shift changes pretty soon.

308
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,200
You gonna pull around back
or should we both get busted out front here?

309
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,700
Oh, Mike.

310
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,600
Nice wax job.

311
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,100
You touch the car again and you're dead.

312
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,100
Okay?

313
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay.

314
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,300
Thank you.

315
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,500
You're gonna get high blood pressure, Mikey.

316
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,200
Pick me up at 8:00 at Rachel's, okay?

317
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,700
We gotta get ready for the tower farm party.

318
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,900
Hey Mikey ...

319
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,800
wanna go have your legs waxed?

320
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,500
All right, that's it. Now, go, go, go.
And don't drink it all before we get there, okay?

321
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Idiot.

322
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,000
What the ...

323
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,100
Okay, asshole.

324
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,000
You wanna play?!

325
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,200
Trick or treat!

326
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,800
Three, two, one.

327
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,300
Can you hear me up here?

328
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,900
Testing: one, two, three.

329
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,700
Ooh, my.
Aren't you pretty?

330
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,100
These are ...
for you.

331
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,900
Aren't they beautiful?

332
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,600
We'll have to put them in water.

333
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,000
... yeah.
- It's great.

334
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,300
It ...

335
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,000
It's ... good luck.

336
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,500
First of all I'd like to thank you parents for supporting ...

337
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,300
... us tonight. Now, what we've all been waiting for
our annual Halloween ...

338
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,200
... costume pageant! Our first couple is Jenny Hogel
and Christian McGint. Give them a big hand.

339
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,300
Next is Tony Larkin and Diane Lewis.
- Jamie, come on.

340
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Tina!

341
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,200
Queen of room service.

342
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,900
Michael, open the door.

343
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,400
Mike!

344
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,500
Michael, it's cold out here!
Come on, open the door!

345
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,300
Mikey.

346
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,700
Mikey.

347
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,200
Thank you for being such a gentleman.

348
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,600
And now we have Billy Hill and Jamie Groder.

349
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,300
You're wearing my present.

350
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,700
I want you to know ...

351
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,600
I just love barbaric men.

352
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,900
Jamie as a princess. Give her a big hand.
- Jamie.

353
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,900
Jamie.

354
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,800
Jamie, come on.

355
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,400
Michael, don't I even get a kiss?

356
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,000
Well, I can't resist your new look.

357
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,400
Jamie, come on.

358
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,000
It feels creepy.

359
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,500
I think. I think she's gonna fall down!

360
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,600
Jamie.

361
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,600
Jamie!

362
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,100
Jamie!

363
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,200
Just great.

364
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,300
The old silent treatment, huh, Mike?

365
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,700
What'd I do wrong this time, huh?

366
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,800
Is it because I wanna see Jamie?

367
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,200
Nothing, Mike. That's what I get. Nothing!

368
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,500
Stop here. I want a pack of cigarettes.

369
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I said, stop the goddamn car!
I want a pack of cigarettes!

370
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,300
Come on.

371
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,400
Great.

372
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,900
Psycho boyfriend.

373
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,500
Jamie.

374
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,600
Tina. Is she in danger? Where is she?
- No. We gotta get her arm.
- Where is she?

375
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,300
Tina. Where is she, Jamie?

376
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,800
Jamie.

377
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,500
You've got to help us!

378
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,000
Get Meeker on the line.

379
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,200
Sergeant Meeker, what's your 20?
- St ... ore!

380
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,200
Store!

381
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,500
Store?

382
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,800
What kind of store?
What do they sell there?

383
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,700
Nie ... er.

384
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,600
Lighter.
- No!

385
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,700
What do they? What do they sell?
- Big ...

386
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,300
Wo ... - Woman.
- A big woman? A big woman who works?

387
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,700
Works in the store?
- No!

388
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,400
What? Jamie, what?

389
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:44,000
Cookie woman!
- Cookie wo ... woman.

390
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,000
Cookie woman?

391
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Cookie woman.

392
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,300
Dale's gas station. Fifth and maine.

393
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,100
Tina Williams!

394
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,800
If you are Tna Williams, stay where you are!

395
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,300
Check the inside!

396
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,500
<i>She appears unharmed.
- What the hell's going on!? I'm fine!</i>

397
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,800
Please, you gotta come with us to the clinic.

398
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,300
Is Jamie all right?

399
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,600
Just get in the car.

400
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,400
We're bringing her in.

401
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,600
Unit 22. A-positive ...

402
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,000
I don't believe this.
- Come on.

403
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,100
Tina!

404
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,200
Where's Jamie? Is something wrong?

405
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,200
Tina!

406
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,100
Say it again!

407
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,900
T- T - Tina.

408
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,100
I love it!

409
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,300
Tina, don't go.
- I have to.

410
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,400
Why?
- Because!

411
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,500
You might not understand, but ...

412
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,200
When you're older, there are people you're gonna meet
who make you feel ...

413
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,800
like, connected.

414
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,400
Like your heart is made of neon, and ...

415
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,000
When you find them, you have to be with them.

416
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,900
But he was with you.
- Who?

417
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,000
The boogeyman.
- Oh, yeah. That's one way of describing him.

418
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,800
Tina. No!

419
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,800
Honey, I will come back later tonight
and I will sleep with you right here.

420
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,800
Tina!

421
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,400
I'll be back.
I love you.

422
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,700
Tina!

423
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:18,500
All right, buddy, let's hit the ... - All right you sto ...
- Why don't you stay the night?
- I'm sorry. I gotta run.

424
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:24,300
Tina, please. - Stay away, okay? You know.
You're really creepy filling that little girl
with all that boogeyman crap.

425
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,900
I believe that you're in danger.

426
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,300
Jamie believes it too.

427
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,600
Jamie's a nine-year-old girl.
- Be sensible!

428
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,600
I'm never sensible if I can help it!

429
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:35,800
Tina!

430
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,200
I got these over here.

431
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,500
For God's sakes, stop her!

432
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,500
On whose orders?
- She hasn't done anything wrong.

433
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,500
Follow her, then!

434
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,400
At least you can do that!

435
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,200
If that girl ...

436
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,400
... dies tonight ...
- All right, all right. For you, doc, anything.

437
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,400
You guys supposed to be trailing me or something?

438
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,300
Well, then you can give me a ride to the Tower Farm.

439
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,900
Tina.
Gotta help Tina!

440
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,300
Jamie's not in her room! She's nowhere in sight!

441
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,600
Hey!
- Loomis!

442
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,300
What the hell are you doing?
- Jamie's gone.

443
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,100
I'm gonna find Tina.

444
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,500
You ... you don't even know where sh ... she is.

445
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,800
But, I do.

446
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,300
Where?

447
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,300
The Tower Farm.

448
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,300
Love your costume.
- Oh, baby!

449
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,800
Tina?

450
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,600
What?
- Where's Mike?

451
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,200
Ask me if I care.

452
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,600
What are you doing?

453
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,300
What are you doing?
- Sitting here.

454
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,800
What do you think?

455
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,100
Well, orders are orders.

456
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,400
That look like a life-threatening situation to you?

457
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,500
Nah.

458
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,600
Play crazy eights?

459
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,900
Spitz and I just had ...

460
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,300
... greatest night together.
- Yeah. What?

461
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,400
Let's go.

462
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,700
Oh, now wait. Hey, you cheated there.
- I did not cheat. - Come on

463
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,400
I did not cheat.

464
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,300
Take me, but spare my friend!

465
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,100
She's a virgin.

466
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,500
Got her phone number?

467
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,500
Do you think that's funny?

468
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,100
Hey, hey, no, man.
No. Hey, just a little Halloween prank, okay?

469
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,800
Definitely not ... funny!

470
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,300
Somebody could easily be dead right now!

471
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,700
Fortunately, we're lousy cops.

472
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:28,900
Sorry.

473
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,400
Hey, guys!

474
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:33,300
Hey.

475
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,200
Look, what I found.

476
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,000
Ohh! Kittens!

477
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,400
Oh, look at 'em.

478
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,300
Hello.
Hello babies.

479
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,400
Hello.
Oh, they're so cute.

480
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,600
Oh, I'm gonna get you.
- Get 'em, Tina! Get 'em!

481
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,400
You, you, you, wait, wait, wait.
Thinking of getting kitten?

482
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,600
Little, wee cat.

483
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,200
Kitten?

484
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,600
Psst! Kitten.

485
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,000
I'm coming to get you!

486
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:15,800
Kitten?

487
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,500
Kitten ...

488
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,300
I hear you, but I don't see you.

489
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,800
Oh, my God.

490
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,900
What am I doing?
I hate cats.

491
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,800
Sam?

492
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,700
Sammy?

493
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,700
Spitz?

494
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,100
I hate you!

495
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,700
Sorry. - God!
- Did you see her face?

496
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,700
You guys!

497
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,600
Fine, I'll just let myself out. Bye.
- I'll be right back.

498
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,400
Have fun.
- Okay.

499
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,300
Spitz!

500
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,600
What makes you think I'm gonna try and find you, huh?

501
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,500
I got you!

502
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,400
I saw you.

503
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,800
Spitz, I'm out of here!

504
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,300
Good night!

505
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,900
Spitz.

506
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,200
Spitz!

507
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,200
Oh, my God!

508
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,100
You son of a bitch!
You scared me half to death!

509
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,300
It wasn't funny!

510
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,600
Spitz, no.

511
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,100
Spitz.
- Why?

512
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,100
Why?
- No.

513
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,400
What's the matter?
- Because I don't ... have anything.

514
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,000
You son of a bitch!

515
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,800
That sounded different.

516
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,800
Yeah, we never did stuff like that when we were kids.
- No, we were normal.

517
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,300
Yeah, let's see what it is.

518
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,900
Hey, fella!

519
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,200
Over here!

520
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,600
Hey, come on. Enough's enough, all right?
- Somebody can get hurt with that thing.

521
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,800
Hey, somebody's gonna get hurt with that thing!

522
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,700
Unbelievable! No respect for authority anymore.

523
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,000
Well, it's the parents.
- Yeah. - Hey!

524
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,200
All right, punk.
I'm through fooling around.

525
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,000
Hey, Sarah!

526
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:01,900
So, you coming to the spring?
Oh, baby. You just wanna see me naked.
- I wouldn't mind.

527
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,400
Come on. The hell with Mike. He ain't gonna show.

528
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,000
I can't leave Sam and Spitz.

529
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,400
Hurry, hurry!

530
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,200
Hurry!

531
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,300
Come on!

532
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,200
Sam?

533
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,600
You guys?

534
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,200
You guys, I don't hear any noise.

535
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,400
Are you sure you're doing it right?

536
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,300
You guys wanna come skinny-dipping?

537
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,300
Maybe you guys are already naked.

538
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,100
Oh, God.

539
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,100
Oh, my God.

540
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,200
Help me!

541
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,900
Help me, please! Somebody, help me! Please, help me!

542
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,200
No!

543
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,800
Oh, God!

544
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,300
Help me!
Please, help me!

545
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,900
Help me!

546
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,000
Mike.

547
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,800
Tina!

548
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,600
Tina!

549
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,700
Leave her alone!

550
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,300
Help!

551
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,700
What do you want?!

552
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,700
Leave her!

553
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,000
No.
- Here.

554
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,900
Here!

555
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,800
Billy!

556
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,700
No!

557
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,700
Billy, no!

558
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,600
Please!

559
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,000
Help!

560
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,100
Please!

561
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,600
Please!

562
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,500
Help!

563
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,600
Help!

564
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,700
No!

565
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,000
Please!

566
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,500
Stay here, Billy. I'll be back.

567
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,200
Leave her alone!

568
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,600
Oh, my God!

569
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,000
Jamie!

570
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,100
Help me!
- Leave her alone!

571
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,400
Stop!

572
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:57,900
Stop! Jamie!

573
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,200
Tina!

574
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,600
Baby.

575
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,100
Tina!

576
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,900
Tina!

577
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,500
No!

578
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,000
Oh, God!

579
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,000
No!

580
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,800
No!

581
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,300
No!

582
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,800
Jamie!

583
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,300
Run!

584
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,700
No!

585
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,000
No! No!

586
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,700
Come on!
- No! Tina!

587
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,100
No!
- Run!

588
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,900
Tina!

589
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,900
Tina!

590
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,600
Come on.

591
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,800
No...

592
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,100
Tina!

593
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,500
Tina!

594
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,600
Tina!

595
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,500
Tin - Tina!

596
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,600
All right, spread out and keep in contact!

597
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,300
Don't shoot!
- There's two of 'em right here!

598
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,300
Loomis!
- Yeah, I've got them here.

599
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,100
Come on. Get 'em out of here!

600
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,500
Spread out. Find the other girl!
- Where's the other one?

601
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,200
Come on, Loomis!
- Get these back here!

602
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,900
Tina's still missing!
- The other girl's still missing!

603
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
All right, come on ...
- Watch yourself!

604
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,600
It's all right. You're gonna be all right.
- Jamie ...

605
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,500
It's gonna be all right.
- Help Tina, please!

606
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Tina!

607
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,400
Tina! Tina!

608
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:35,300
All right. Put three units over at the reservoir ...,
and let me know when ...
- Now are you willing to help me?

609
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,900
<i>I wanna keep an eye on that ...</i>

610
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,700
Can you kill him?

611
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,300
I think so.

612
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,400
Now wait a minute, Loomis. There isn't a minute to wait.

613
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,300
What do you want me to do?

614
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,800
Michael.

615
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,200
It will destroy you too.

616
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,100
One day,

617
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,200
Michael ...

618
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,700
this rage ...

619
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
which drives you.

620
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:34,100
You think if you kill them all, it will go away?

621
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,000
It won't.

622
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,500
You have to fight it ...

623
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,300
in the place where it's strongest.

624
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,300
Where it all began!

625
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:54,300
-if you want to get rid of this ... rage.

626
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,000
Michael, go home.

627
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,900
Go home!

628
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,400
Go to your house.

629
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,200
I shall be there waiting for you!

630
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,800
You'll find ...

631
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,300
her ...

632
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,700
waiting for you.

633
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,600
Can he see us from the street?

634
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,700
Not a chance.

635
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,900
Station one, are you sure he can't see you?

636
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,800
<i>Inside units, I want a report every five minutes.
- Roger.</i>

637
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,600
10 - 4.

638
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,300
He may not be able to see you, Sheriff ...

639
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,600
But we can all certainly hear you.

640
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,500
All right, relax, Loomis. This is my operation.

641
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,700
All right, fellas. Let's keep it down on the radio chatter.

642
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,200
Looks like you and me are the only ones
around here keeping our cool.

643
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,900
Good idea.

644
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,400
You wanna practice our signals?

645
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,000
All right.

646
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,100
You do that good and loud,
I'll be out here ...

647
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,500
in a flash.

648
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,100
You're one brave little girl.

649
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,400
Bi - Billy?

650
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,400
Billy!

651
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,800
Billy!

652
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,400
Dr. Loomis!

653
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,300
Bi - Billy.
- Dr. Loomis!

654
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,000
Billy!

655
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,100
Meeker, he's at the clinic.

656
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,700
Bi - Billy.

657
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,700
This is car 16 calling the Masterson Clinic.

658
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,300
Car 16 calling the Masterson Clinic.

659
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:46,000
We just had a distress call from the clinic.

660
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,500
They haven't been able to reach them again.

661
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,200
There were four men up there.

662
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,200
All right. This is Sheriff Meeker.

663
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,100
All mobile units ...

664
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,400
proceed immediately to the Masterson Clinic.

665
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,500
Okay, let's go!

666
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,900
Move out! Move out!

667
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,000
Come on. Get going.

668
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,200
Stop dragging your ass!
Move, move, move!

669
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,600
All right. You stay here.
Loomis, I'm moving the girl to the police station.
She'll be safer there.

670
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,600
Understood.

671
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,800
Move it out!

672
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,200
Let's go! - We're all clear.
- The girl, Charlie and Loomis are in this there.
- All right. I got it.

673
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Come on! Let's get out of here.

674
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,000
Now you'll come.

675
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,500
Won't you, Michael?

676
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,900
I'd say you've done your night's work.

677
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,200
Come on. My pal Eddie and I'll
give you a ride to the station.

678
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:06,000
Let's go.

679
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,400
Dr. Loomis.

680
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,300
What the hell are you doing?

681
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,900
We aren't taking her ... anywhere.

682
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,400
You've got five seconds to give me that key ...

683
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,800
before I take it.

684
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,000
<i>Charlie.
Can you read me?</i>

685
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,300
This is Charlie. What's going on?

686
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,800
There's a car approaching.

687
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,000
<i>I'll check it out.</i>

688
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,600
Looks like one of ours.
It's a code two.

689
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,600
Eddie, do you read me?

690
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,100
Eddie, can you read me?

691
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,700
Eddie, come in!

692
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,500
Christ!

693
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:12,500
I've got to call Meeker.

694
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,300
You crazy son of a bitch!

695
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,900
Charlie.

696
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,500
Charlie ...

697
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,600
Michael Myers ...

698
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,000
is outside.

699
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,800
Stay with the little girl.

700
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,100
Please?

701
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,000
This is all right.

702
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,000
Don't worry about this.

703
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,500
We have to get out of here.

704
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,400
You ...

705
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,500
You've come back to us, Michael?

706
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,100
I ...

707
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:07,100
I know why you've come back, Michael.

708
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,900
Because the little girl ...

709
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:16,200
The little girl can stop the rage inside.

710
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,900
She knows how to do it, Michael.

711
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,500
If you let her.

712
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,000
She can s ...

713
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,300
stop the rage ...

714
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,200
The rage inside.

715
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,600
Oh, she's not up there, Michael.

716
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,700
She's down here in the middle of the old house where ...

717
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,600
Your house ... Michael.

718
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,200
Your house.

719
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,400
Don't you remember ...

720
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,500
how much better ...

721
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,400
you used to be?

722
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,400
Let ... let me take you ...

723
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:58,200
Let me take you to her.

724
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,500
She'll take the rage away.

725
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:02,600
Michael ...

726
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:03,700
you'll be ...

727
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,300
better ... then.

728
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,800
You don't need the ...

729
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,100
You don't need that.

730
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,100
Hurry!

731
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,600
Please!

732
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,400
Hurry!

733
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,600
Please ...

734
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,000
All right. Get on that side over there.

735
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,100
Step over it.

736
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:05,600
All right.

737
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,100
I need you on my back.

738
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:09,700
You just hold on.

739
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,100
All right.

740
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,400
All right.

741
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,300
Come on.

742
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:04,500
Come on, kids.

743
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:05,900
No!, this side.

744
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,500
Yes, sir.
- Inside. There!

745
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,000
Hold it.

746
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,200
Oh, God. Damn it!

747
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,700
Move it. Quickly!

748
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,700
All right. When everybody's out.
I want a sweep of the building and grounds.

749
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,800
<i>Sheriff Meeker, do you copy?
- Yeah! - Third floor's secure. Willie's on the second</i>

750
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,100
All right, keep it up.

751
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,600
Please don't let him get me.

752
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,000
Please, God.

753
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,300
No ...

754
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,600
Max!

755
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,100
No!

756
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,500
Rachel!

757
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,100
No!

758
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,200
Rachel?

759
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,700
Help me. Help me.

760
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:49,700
Uncle?

761
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,700
Boogeyman?

762
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:07,700
Let me see.

763
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,800
You're just like me.

764
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,000
Let me.

765
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,100
Oh, God!

766
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,100
You want her?

767
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,400
No!
- Here she is!

768
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,500
She's yours!

769
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:21,200
No!
- Your ... little girl! - No!

770
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,600
Oh, no!

771
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,200
No! No!
- Come and get her.

772
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:28,800
Please!

773
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,300
Come and ...
- No!

774
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,800
No! Please!
- Come and get your little girl. - No!

775
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:41,700
No!
- Come take us both. - No!

776
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:43,600
No!

777
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:44,700
Michael ...

778
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,300
Let's play a game.
- No.

779
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,600
Can you catch the little girl? Come catch.

780
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,400
No!

781
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,500
Michael.
- No.

782
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:59,400
No!
- Get the little girl, then ... then you're home and safe.

783
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,700
Die! Die!

784
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:51,200
Die! Die, Michael!

785
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,800
Die!

786
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:00,600
Die! Die!

787
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:03,600
D ...

788
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:49,800
National Guard will take him
to a maximum security facility.

789
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:52,600
Where he'll stay till the day he dies.

790
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,500
He'll never die.

791
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,300
All right. Take her back to the clinic.

792
01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,700
Come on.

793
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,900
Ok, Tony I'll see you in the morning, huh?

794
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,800
Good job.
- All right. Take care. Joe's back.

795
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:18,700
Hey Joe!

796
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:21,300
Yeah.

797
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:24,300
Don't forget. You said you'd cover for me tomorrow.

798
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,300
Yeah, I got it. Don't worry about it.

799
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:27,600
Take it easy.

800
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,200
Hey, you said you're gonna cover for me too!
- Get out of here.

801
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:58,900
Spread out!

802
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,300
Wait in the car.

803
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,400
No.

804
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:46,900
No!
