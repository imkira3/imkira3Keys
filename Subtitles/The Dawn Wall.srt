2
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,600
Hello?

3
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,678
'Hey, guys. It's
John Branch from "The NY Times".

4
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,262
'How's it going up there?'

5
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,972
Good, John.

6
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,684
'How high up
are you guys right now?'

7
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,487
We are about 1,200 feet
up the wall at our base camp.

8
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,191
This has been our home
for nine days now.

9
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,153
'Tommy, I guess
the bottom line question here,

10
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,703
'why are you doing this?

11
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,703
'What's the point
of all this for you?'

12
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,336
On the air tonight
with a story of two men

13
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,418
attempting to free climb
the famously steep face

14
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,004
of El Capitan in Yosemite.

15
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,601
Inch by nerve-racking inch,

16
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,932
using only their fingertips
to grasp razor sharp edges.

17
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,313
Tommy Caldwell
and Kevin Jorgeson

18
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,690
attempt the hardest climb
in the world.

19
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:57,068
No one has ever
free-climbed the Dawn Wall.

20
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,151
3,000 feet
of straight-up granite.

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,831
A climb watched by the world.

22
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,586
These guys have
captured the world's attention.

23
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,593
They're trying to make history.

24
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,594
El Capitan's infamous Dawn Wall.

25
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,903
As a kid,
Tommy was slow at everything.

26
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,622
He had a lot of difficulty
in school.

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,450
The teachers actually
at one point told us

28
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,128
that he was mentally retarded
and would never learn.

29
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:57,505
I was developmentally delayed
through... probably still.

30
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,006
I was this very fragile
little kid,

31
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,932
incredibly shy.

32
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:09,683
But meanwhile, my dad was,
like, the symbol of a man.

33
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,026
He was this big bodybuilder dude
and mountain climber.

34
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,194
Larger than life.

35
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,148
Tommy was small.

36
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,699
He was way behind.

37
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,118
Didn't crawl until he was
over two.

38
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,741
I think my dad felt

39
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,119
the best way to prepare this
fragile little kid for the world

40
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,666
was to toughen him up
a little bit.

41
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,038
So he took me
on all these adventures.

42
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,090
Three years old,
strap on the skis.

43
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,838
Camping in a snow cave
during a blizzard.

44
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,092
Every summer, we'd go
to Yosemite with my family,

45
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,299
and my dad would take me
climbing on these giant walls.

46
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,387
Some of the craziest climbing
stunts you could ever do,

47
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,347
and he did it
with a six-year-old.

48
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,485
The things
that Tommy's dad took him on,

49
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,189
today you would have
Child Protective Services

50
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,739
coming after you.

51
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:07,286
He basically took hardship
and rephrased it as growth.

52
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,365
He was loving,
but he definitely let me suffer.

53
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,078
The word that was in my mind
was resilience.

54
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,880
It seems to me one of the
best gifts you can give your kid

55
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,583
is an ability
to deal with adversity.

56
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,513
By the time
I was 14 or 15,

57
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,593
there was climbs that I could do
that my dad couldn't.

58
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,973
Tommy's strong.

59
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,930
Climbing was
the first thing in my life

60
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,981
where I could stand out
a little bit.

61
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,649
Alright. Woo!

62
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,528
So Tommy was 16,

63
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,903
and Snowbird held the Snowbird
Invitational that year.

64
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,825
This big
climbing competition.

65
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,278
We thought we'd drive over there
and watch the comp

66
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,659
and get some autographs.

67
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,990
We just went there
to be fans, really.

68
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,951
And the day before
the big competition,

69
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,787
they had a Citizens' Comp that
anybody who shows up can enter.

70
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,169
So I entered that,
my first competition ever.

71
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,716
Well, Tommy won.

72
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,261
And I don't know
if this was an official policy

73
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,510
or just something
they dreamt up on the spot,

74
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,056
but they asked Tommy

75
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,010
if he wanted to enter the
World Invitational the next day.

76
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,686
Hello, everyone.
I'm James Brown,

77
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,229
and welcome to Snowbird, Utah,

78
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,398
for the International
Sport Climbing Championship.

79
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,567
Expert climbers
will test their skills

80
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,363
against a man-made
120-foot wall.

81
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,064
There were 12 competitors.

82
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,901
- The icons of climbing.
- It was so intimidating.

83
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,995
Nobody had ever
heard of me.

84
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,952
I was just
this scrawny little kid.

85
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,583
I was videoing Tommy as he goes
climbing up this thing.

86
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,052
Come on, Tommy.

87
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,925
He got past
the final roof.

88
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,137
So Tommy's winning.

89
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,936
Alright, Tommy!

90
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,313
And I started shaking.

91
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,486
I just dropped the camera.

92
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,443
I mean I completely lost it.

93
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,866
Tommy got to the top.

94
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,165
The only climber
to complete this climb.

95
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,790
So all of a sudden,
Tommy went from nobody at all

96
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,043
to winner of Snowbird

97
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,295
I mean,
that was just unbelievable.

98
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,968
It changed his whole life.

99
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,465
Tommy became known

100
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,547
as one of the best
young climbers.

101
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,756
But he didn't grow up

102
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,216
the way most of us do.

103
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,222
Through high school
he didn't have girlfriends.

104
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,396
He didn't have a social life.
He just went climbing.

105
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,274
I was doing
this series of competitions,

106
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,072
and I met this girl, Beth.

107
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,151
She just caught my attention
totally. I was like, "Woah!"

108
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,785
Tommy just had this really big,
goofy, endearing grin.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,334
We both lived and breathed
climbing.

110
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,661
Tommy's
this climbing savant,

111
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:07,296
and then he meets Beth,
the female version of himself.

112
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,046
He's head over heels.

113
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,629
I just found ways
to go wherever she was.

114
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,964
- OK?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,801
I found out
she was going to Yosemite,

116
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,307
so I followed her out there.

117
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,935
We ended up climbing
a big wall together.

118
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,267
You know, we were
next to each other all the time.

119
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,319
24 hours a day together.

120
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,488
Sleeping 1,000 feet off
the ground on this portaledge,

121
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,032
which is like a hanging cot.

122
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,453
You sleep head to toe.
There's just more room that way.

123
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,121
Sol laid down,

124
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,074
and she laid down
the same way that I was,

125
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,034
with her head at the same end.

126
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,664
And I was
pretty excited by this.

127
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,748
I was like, "Ooh, goodness.
This is getting exciting."

128
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,842
I just hadn't been
in love before,

129
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,217
and I just fell hardcore,
right off the bat.

130
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,009
It just clicked.

131
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:02,222
We had so many dreams of
traveling and climbing together.

132
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,477
And then we got invited
to go on a big adventure trip.

133
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,188
An expedition to Kyrgyzstan.

134
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,899
Kyrgyzstan is this beautiful,
mountainous country

135
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,404
in Central Asia.

136
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,032
We'd seen pictures from friends
that had been there,

137
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,909
and it looked like a paradise
for climbers.

138
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,867
I was a photographer
working in the outdoor industry.

139
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,919
And this amazing opportunity
came about for me

140
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,169
to shoot an expedition
with Beth and Tommy and Jason.

141
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,967
We were just four young climbers
looking for a big adventure

142
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,387
in a new and unusual part
of the world.

143
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,011
We charter a helicopter
into the Kara-Su Valley.

144
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,264
Unbelievably beautiful.

145
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,062
Just felt like
a dream come true,

146
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,890
out in the middle
of this adventure

147
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,350
with this girl
that I was totally in love with.

148
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,357
A week-and-a-half into our trip,

149
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,359
the four of us were sleeping
in portaledges

150
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,065
1,000 feet up the wall,

151
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,448
and we wake up to gunshots...

152
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,620
...these piercing,
close gunshots.

153
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,416
The bullets hitting the wall
right between our portaledges.

154
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,867
We're sitting there like,

155
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,703
"Oh, my God,
we're getting shot at."

156
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,504
And you can't run away.
You can't do anything.

157
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,548
We're just sitting ducks
up here.

158
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,048
We look down,
and you could see these figures.

159
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,925
These guys
waving at us to come down.

160
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,927
We rappelled down
to the ground.

161
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:24,182
We're encountered
by four guys, heavily armed.

162
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,979
They took us
to our base camp.

163
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,647
All of our tents
were cut open.

164
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,566
A lot of our food
was splayed around the meadow.

165
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,610
They had us start
hiding our camp.

166
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,780
And so suddenly, it hits us,
we're hostages right now.

167
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,992
Later,
we learned that these guys

168
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,670
were part of the
Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan,

169
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,748
these rebels that wanted
to overthrow the government.

170
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,252
We were caught up
in this battle

171
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,305
between these rebels
and the Kyrgyz military.

172
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,890
All of a sudden,

173
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,639
Kyrgyz military helicopters
started to fly over,

174
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,471
soldiers show up
on the hillside,

175
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,852
and this battle breaks out.

176
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,685
The rebels start pointing their
guns at us, yelling, "Hide!"

177
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,815
Then we dive in these trees.

178
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,648
The rebels had taken
a Kyrgyz soldier hostage.

179
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,153
They took the other captive.

180
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,985
And they just shot him
in the head.

181
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,367
I just remember
shaking uncontrollably

182
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,870
and Tommy just holding me
as tight as he could.

183
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,418
Are they just going to
kill us next?

184
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,878
Once it's dark,
the gunfire dies down.

185
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,632
And the rebels start marching us
through the mountains.

186
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:48,221
It's four rebels,
the four of us.

187
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,976
It's really cold.
We're 11,000 feet in elevation.

188
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,682
We don't have warm clothes.

189
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,358
We don't have any food.

190
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,654
We had no idea
where we were going.

191
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,198
We would
hike through the night,

192
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,741
and then during the day,
they would hide us.

193
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,744
They hid us
in the craziest spots.

194
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,042
Burying us
in holes in the ground

195
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,417
so that we wouldn't be seen
by the military.

196
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,293
This went on
for six days.

197
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,093
Day two or three,
hunger really started to set in.

198
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,093
You know,
we're sort of just wasting away.

199
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,595
I thought they're
taking us back to their base

200
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,472
or they're taking us somewhere,
there's a purpose to this.

201
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,304
Finally, we realized

202
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,935
they were leading us
in a giant circle.

203
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,234
Like, these guys
clearly don't have a plan.

204
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,859
Jason and John started to scheme
about how we could get away.

205
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,906
I mean, things were getting
super desperate.

206
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,735
They were ready to take matters
into their own hands.

207
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,286
At one point,
two of our captors left.

208
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,409
We never saw them again.

209
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,039
We found out later
that they got killed.

210
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,962
On our sixth night of captivity,

211
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,541
the two captors
that were remaining with us

212
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,797
decided that one of them
would go in one direction

213
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,173
to try and get some food

214
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,550
and then we would head off
with the other one.

215
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,054
So we get left alone
with the one rebel,

216
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,310
climbing up this cliff side.

217
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,734
We were comfortable
on the terrain, and he was not.

218
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,439
If we're going to escape,
this is the opportunity.

219
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,274
Jason and John decided

220
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,202
they would try and push our
remaining captor off this cliff

221
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,744
and then run away.

222
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,823
John and I were trying
to look for a point

223
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,032
that we could throw him off.

224
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,994
But we kept going
and kept going.

225
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,580
We just couldn't quite push him.

226
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,381
As we got to the top,

227
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,676
I realized that our opportunity
was going to be over.

228
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,595
And I decided that this was
what I had to do.

229
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:57,524
I had to go and I needed
to push this guy off this cliff

230
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,191
in order to save our lives.

231
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,237
Tommy came over to me
at this point, and he said,

232
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,064
"Do you think I should do this?"

233
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,275
I was thinking,
"Yes, no, yes, no."

234
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,451
So I just didn't say anything.

235
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:12,952
I took that as
that she would be OK with it.

236
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,917
So I just ran up behind him

237
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:24,218
and I put one hand on his back
and grabbed his gun strap.

238
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,717
And my other hand
went on his chest

239
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,173
and I just gave a push...

240
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,471
...to send him flying off
this cliff.

241
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,779
We saw him hit a ledge,

242
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,983
bounce off of it, and just fall
out of sight into the darkness.

243
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,946
Tommy completely broke down,

244
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,578
had his head in his arms
and he was crying.

245
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,625
I couldn't believe
what I had just done.

246
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,544
I had just killed somebody.

247
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,966
The whole world came
crashing down on me all at once.

248
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,919
We were all trying
to reassure him and say that,

249
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,755
"You're not a bad person,
you just saved our lives."

250
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,590
They really tried
to comfort me.

251
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,846
But there was a sense of urgency
that we better get going,

252
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,396
because we didn't know if the
other captor was gonna show up.

253
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,848
We knew
from hiking in earlier

254
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,231
where there was a military
outpost we could try and run to.

255
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,858
So even on almost no food
for six days,

256
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,280
adrenaline kicked in.

257
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,948
So we ran for four hours.

258
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,026
Through the darkness
down this valley.

259
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,782
We were greeted by this
man yelling at us with this gun.

260
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,831
Throw up our hands, start
yelling that we're Americans.

261
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,159
And luckily,
it was the Kyrgyz army.

262
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,371
This huge wave of relief
came over us.

263
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,005
This horrible situation
that we had been in was over.

264
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,388
They gave us food and water,
military fatigues.

265
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,762
And then we got
helicoptered out from there.

266
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,608
From our studios
in New York, here's Jane Pauley.

267
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,903
Four young Americans
face a life or death choice,

268
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:11,234
with the ultimate question,
to kill or be killed?

269
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,945
When we got home, there
was this crazy media circus.

270
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,872
You guys are walking
with this captor

271
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,916
on a very rocky cliff.

272
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,334
Tell me what you did, Tommy.

273
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,504
We just ended up
pushing the guy.

274
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,171
- You pushed him over the cliff.
- Yeah.

275
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,250
What happened at that moment
when you realized,

276
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,506
I've actually done this,
I've killed somebody?

277
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,009
I thought that I was
an evil person. I said to Beth,

278
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:37,638
"How can you love me after I did
something like this?"

279
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,686
And, uh...

280
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,181
After Kyrgyzstan,

281
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,608
Tommy had tremendous
personality changes.

282
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,652
Speaking so softly.

283
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,698
I was like, what is inside me
that allowed me to do this?

284
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,073
Just an entirely
different person.

285
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,783
Yosemite is known

286
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,831
as the Mecca
of world rock climbing.

287
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,747
And the crown jewel
of this Mecca is El Capitan.

288
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:54,841
It's just this iconic
3,000 foot high monolith.

289
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,093
When you see that thing
for the first time,

290
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,891
it takes your breath away.

291
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,687
The steepest, blankest,
most forlorn...

292
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,936
impressive part of El Cap

293
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,108
is the Dawn Wall.

294
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,064
People have done a handful
of free climbs up El Cap

295
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,274
to the right and to the left.

296
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,705
But the Dawn Wall
has never been climbed.

297
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,580
Just the sheer magnitude
of blank rock on the thing,

298
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,127
it just looks impossible.

299
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,040
Until Tommy Caldwell came along,

300
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,094
nobody had actually
considered trying it.

301
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:40,014
If Tommy and his partner Kevin
can actually do this,

302
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:45,517
it will be the most continuously
difficult rock climb ever done.

303
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,100
Nothing else
is even close to it.

304
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,525
It's December 27th,

305
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,404
and we're planning on heading up
for like two weeks plus.

306
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,069
We'll see.

307
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,748
The goal is climb it
in a single push,

308
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,041
which means we're going to
leave the ground,

309
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,994
live on the wall,

310
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,919
and not come down
until we're done.

311
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,960
We're going for it.

312
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,887
I'm nervous.

313
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,468
We've put in so much work
leading up to this moment.

314
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,600
There's nothing left to do
but take a couple deep breaths

315
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,180
and start climbing.

316
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,434
Day one.

317
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,984
Yup.

318
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,522
This is going to be awesome.

319
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,408
The Dawn Wall itself
is 3,000 feet tall.

320
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,790
The route that they think
they have figured out

321
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,836
is comprised of
32 individual pitches.

322
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:56,838
Each pitch is its own challenge,
like the stages of a race.

323
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,469
A pitch is a rope-length long,
about 150 feet or so.

324
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,049
And ends of the ledge

325
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,512
are a natural resting place
on the rock.

326
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,472
Yeah, man. Good work.

327
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,056
When you end the pitch,

328
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,313
you anchor yourself
to the wall...

329
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,862
One down,
thirty-something to go.

330
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,066
...and hold the rope or
belay as your partner comes up.

331
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,824
Once you've both done
that pitch without falling,

332
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,076
you can move on
to the next pitch.

333
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,325
When you're
free-climbing,

334
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,286
you're using
your hands and feet

335
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,838
to climb the natural features
on the rock

336
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,667
without any assistance
from the rope.

337
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,511
- Good job.
- Yeah, man.

338
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,305
You take turns
leading each pitch,

339
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,885
placing protection in the cracks
to catch you in case you fall.

340
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,604
Yeah, come on.
You got it.

341
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,682
Ugh! Oh!

342
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,899
If you fall,

343
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:03,154
you just go back down
to the beginning of that pitch,

344
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,986
and then the other guy tries it.

345
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,037
They have
a certain number of pitches

346
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,035
they're trying to get through
each day

347
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,913
to stay on track
to finish this climb.

348
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,667
The first few pitches
are relatively easy.

349
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,123
But as you get higher
on the wall...

350
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,713
...the wall gets steeper,

351
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,890
the holes get smaller,

352
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,853
and the climbing
gets way more difficult.

353
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,352
It's hard to articulate

354
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,984
the level of detail
that's required.

355
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:48,111
You can't make any mistake
in where you grab the hold

356
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,038
and how you place your toe.

357
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,164
You're pushing and pulling
as hard as you possibly can,

358
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,837
always on the verge
of slipping off.

359
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,801
Argh!

360
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,595
Oh, no!

361
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,343
- Oh!
- Oh, foot slip.

362
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,224
We climb all day
into the night,

363
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,228
trying the same pitch
until we both do it.

364
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,948
Come on, Tommy!

365
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,360
Come on!

366
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,157
Man, I'm getting tired.

367
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,367
Tommy is just
a man possessed.

368
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,749
Come on. Finish this.

369
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,547
Yeah, come on.

370
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,383
Yeah, man.

371
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,257
<i>'Lee-hoe!</i>

372
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,804
And I'm just trying to keep up.

373
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,677
You got it, Kevin.
Come on!

374
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,885
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

375
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,970
Yeah, that was awesome, dude.

376
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,101
Thank God I didn't fall.

377
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,232
Nice, man.

378
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,435
When you're trying
a big wall like this,

379
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,020
the work does not end

380
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,823
once the climbing is done
at the end of the day.

381
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,901
You've got to haul up
hundreds of pounds of gear,

382
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,986
set up portaledges...

383
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:16,245
This seems pretty good.
Pretty flat, even, I would say.

384
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,292
...and gag down some food.

385
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,496
I actually brought
a bag of kale on the wall

386
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,298
to put it in our burritos.
Mmh!

387
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,882
This is the hardest thing you
could ever do on your fingers,

388
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,638
climbing this route.

389
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,640
It's just grabbing razor blades.

390
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,814
I tape up any wounds
with Neosporin for healing.

391
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,892
Then I wake up probably
twice in the night and reapply.

392
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,480
Getting pretty obsessed
with my lips.

393
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,906
Then you've got to hope
you can get a little sleep.

394
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,861
The next day is going to be
more of the same, but harder.

395
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,162
And it's going to go on
day after clay,

396
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,241
two weeks, three weeks.
Nobody knows.

397
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,555
After Kyrgyzstan,

398
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,559
we're trying to absorb
what had happened.

399
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,810
Beth is really traumatized.

400
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,518
I started to have
nightmares and couldn't sleep.

401
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:28,150
I did not want to be separated
from Tommy at that point.

402
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,232
Beth and I are bonded
at the hip. I'm her rock.

403
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,658
We go to church a few times.

404
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,531
We hadn't been to church
in ten years.

405
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,079
We're just searching.
We're like, what does this mean?

406
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,577
We go to a therapist.

407
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,033
It's like nobody knows
how to deal with this situation.

408
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,662
I think my way
of dealing with it was

409
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:48,671
you just get back on that horse
and go climb again.

410
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,463
This has always been
my safe place,

411
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,673
my way to deal with life.

412
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,476
I didn't know what to think
about Kyrgyzstan.

413
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,691
Part of me was feeling
kind of empowered.

414
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:08,019
I was like, when the shit
really hit the fan,

415
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,445
I was able to do
what needed to be done

416
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,399
to get us out of there.

417
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,609
Tommy jumped
right back into climbing,

418
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,741
and slowly we got back
into our groove.

419
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,619
We're both
professional rock climbers,

420
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,826
doing these really cool climbs
all over the place.

421
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,754
He started
setting these lofty goals.

422
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,799
Trying to climb
harder and harder routes.

423
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,502
And then, about a year
after Kyrgyzstan,

424
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,803
we were remodeling
this tiny little cabin.

425
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:42,304
And Tommy was using
his parent's old table saw.

426
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,855
Tommy did something
that you should never do,

427
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,354
which is he tried
to pull a small piece of wood

428
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,276
through the table saw.

429
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,944
If the blade catches
on the wood,

430
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,397
it sucks your hand
right back into the blade.

431
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,821
I heard Tommy scream,

432
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,367
"I fucking cut off my finger,
I cut off my finger."

433
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,490
Completely cut his finger off
instantly.

434
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,038
It was over in the bushes.

435
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,207
Beth finds the finger
laying in this pile of sawdust.

436
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,751
We throw it on ice,
drive to the hospital.

437
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,751
My dad comes in, and he's like,
"You have to fix his finger."

438
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,549
And so for two weeks,
they tried to reattach it.

439
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,296
Three different surgeries.

440
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,095
But it became apparent that the
finger wasn't going to survive.

441
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,517
This one doctor
who was a climber

442
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,096
came in and told Tommy
that he was going to have to

443
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,770
come up with a new career now.

444
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:29,692
There's no way he was going to
make it as a climber any longer.

445
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,566
Oh, that was...

446
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,523
either the wrong thing
or the right thing to say,

447
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,575
because it sure fired him up.

448
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,368
I was like, "Fuck that guy!"

449
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,446
"He doesn't know
what I'm capable of."

450
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,703
I remember the
first time he tried to climb.

451
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,034
Good, Tommy.

452
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,251
He was like, "Whoa!"

453
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,673
You know, it's going to be hard.

454
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,091
Good job, sweetie.

455
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,089
When I heard
he cut his finger off, I go,

456
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,467
"Well, so much
for Tommy Caldwell."

457
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,922
The grip in climbing is,

458
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,383
you wrap your thumb
over your finger like that

459
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,139
and pull down
on the little edges,

460
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:08,473
and if there's no finger there,
the physics are all wrong.

461
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,607
I don't know about that.

462
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,063
Everybody around me,
except for Beth and my parents,

463
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:20,242
looked at me and they're like,
"He's done. That's so sad."

464
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,036
I knew it wasn't
going to be easy.

465
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,409
But ever since Kyrgyzstan,

466
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,161
I just have this fire in me

467
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:31,121
that is different than
anything I've had before.

468
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,833
He had all these jars
of rice and beans and gravel.

469
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,259
He's supposed to jam
that nub of a finger in there.

470
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,178
I just abused the thing

471
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,551
to retrain the nerves,
to toughen them up.

472
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,886
Those six days of captivity
in Kyrgyzstan

473
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,728
were so profoundly painful.

474
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,229
At first, I felt overwhelmed

475
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:01,864
with fear and fatigue
and hunger.

476
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,617
But at some point,
I felt something come over me,

477
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,040
this reserve of energy,

478
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,869
this confidence.

479
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,045
I knew I was cold,
I knew I was hungry,

480
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,498
but those things
didn't matter anymore.

481
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:27,260
I think we all have this idea
of where our limits lie.

482
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,969
If you're hurting really bad,

483
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,977
you get to a point where you're
like, "I can't endure any more."

484
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,310
And it takes something
to force you past that.

485
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:41,149
In Kyrgyzstan, I realized
that my preconceived limits

486
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,826
were totally off base,

487
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,489
that we're capable
of so much more

488
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,416
than we really
could ever imagine.

489
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,048
There was this really
hard climb nobody had done

490
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,718
that he tried the year
before he cut off his finger,

491
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,590
and he couldn't do it.

492
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,922
A year later, he came back
without the finger

493
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,849
and he did it.

494
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,892
He cuts off his finger.

495
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,345
"Oh, no big deal. I'll just
get better after that."

496
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,977
I have no idea
how that's possible.

497
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,936
That's when Tommy
took his game

498
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,944
to the biggest stage on Earth,
which is El Cap.

499
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,445
At that time,

500
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,618
there were only a few
free climbs that went up El Cap.

501
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,743
Some of the hardest
big wall climbs ever done.

502
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,949
Just to claim
one of these routes

503
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,082
would have been
a monumental achievement

504
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,459
for the best climbers
in the world.

505
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,711
And then Tommy
walks into the Valley,

506
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,294
missing a finger,

507
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,755
and just started knocking them
down, one after the other.

508
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,512
Over the next five years,
he went on a rampage.

509
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,186
I did basically all
the existing routes on El Cap.

510
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,808
- Salathe Wall.
- The Zodiac.

511
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,014
El Corazon.

512
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,349
- Golden Gate.
- The Nose.

513
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,525
Then he starts
speed climbing these routes,

514
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,273
linking one into the other.

515
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,072
Two El Cap routes
in a day.

516
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,320
6,000 feet of climbing.

517
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,696
That was unheard of.

518
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,903
- You did it!
- Oh, my goodness.

519
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,454
And then I started looking
for new routes.

520
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,035
Tommy started looking
between the lines

521
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,790
for his own first ascents.

522
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,246
It added that element
of the unknown,

523
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,675
this what-if, like,
maybe that could be climbed.

524
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,216
I think Tommy
had become hypnotized

525
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,298
trying to figure out,
where is the ultimate limit?

526
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,008
Oh, shit.

527
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,263
I did the first ascent
of the Muir Wall.

528
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,519
- The West Buttress.
- Dihedral Wall.

529
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,974
Magic Mushroom.

530
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,435
Anybody that does
a first ascent on El Capitan

531
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:42,986
has their place in history
forever.

532
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,439
Tommy did five of them.

533
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,117
Anything he could
dream up, he did it.

534
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,491
And everyone in the climbing
world is like, "What the hell?"

535
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,869
He's Mr. El Cap.

536
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,543
The best
big wall climber ever.

537
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,498
And Beth
was with him all the time,

538
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,335
climbing all of these routes
together.

539
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,261
We just poured
our hearts into climbing

540
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,260
and supporting each other
on these goals.

541
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,263
It was quite a team.

542
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,970
They were known
as the first couple of climbing.

543
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,644
There was one word -
Beth and Tommy.

544
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,277
We get married.

545
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,698
We ended up buying property
like 20 minutes from El Capitan

546
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,445
and building a house there.

547
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,743
We're nearly there!

548
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,821
We were just
going to live in Yosemite

549
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,328
and raise our kids there
and keep climbing.

550
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,830
I was good friends
with them both,

551
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,582
and we were next-door neighbors.

552
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,162
They seemed so happy.

553
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,872
I'm like, wow, this life

554
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,254
that I never even saw coming
in the first place

555
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,212
is starting
to just magically appear.

556
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:54,388
Things are going
seemingly really well,

557
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:58,141
at least from my mind.

558
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:03,898
But I'm noticing, over time,
little cracks started to form.

559
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,195
The first inklings
of almost hostility towards me.

560
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,487
There was
all this weird tension.

561
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,908
And I was just like,

562
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,282
well, we've been together
for eight years now.

563
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,284
Marriages go through
troubling times.

564
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,371
We'll get through this
and just keep climbing.

565
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,581
I think there was
a natural growing apart,

566
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,589
desires we had
outside of climbing.

567
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,881
I think going through
a super intense experience

568
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,966
like Kyrgyzstan...

569
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,222
I mean, we were so young.

570
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,146
Years later, there's probably
a lot that started to come out,

571
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,848
healing that I hadn't done.

572
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:47,437
And at some point,
the climbing we had

573
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:51,194
wasn't enough glue
to hold it together anymore.

574
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,650
In Kyrgyzstan,

575
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,612
Beth was extremely traumatized
by those six days,

576
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,290
and Tommy was the person
who saved them.

577
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,208
And so from that, I think

578
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,663
a sort of dependency
probably developed

579
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:09,591
that isn't necessarily
the same thing as true love.

580
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,635
Eventually,

581
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,589
she started feeling something
for somebody else.

582
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,683
And...

583
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,512
I don't know
how to summarize this.

584
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,348
This is kind of a hard thing
to talk about, but...

585
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,606
that relationship with her and
this other man just solidified

586
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,812
in a way that she couldn't
walk away from that anymore.

587
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,739
And she wanted that more
than she wanted me.

588
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,788
Once the divorce
fully happened, I...

589
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,664
Yeah, I was just crushed.

590
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,082
I drove to the rim
of Yosemite Valley

591
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,963
and was looking across
at El Capitan.

592
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:57,260
It felt like
El Cap was all I had.

593
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,728
Early in the morning,

594
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,183
there's this one panel of
the Wall that illuminates first.

595
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,867
That's why it's called
the Dawn Wall.

596
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,495
The last unclimbed
big swath of stone.

597
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,792
I had looked at it
a little bit before and knew

598
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,746
that it was way too hard,
I'd never be able to do it.

599
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,375
But I was just hurting so bad

600
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,255
that I had to figure out
a distraction in life.

601
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:38,009
I couldn't just sit there
and feel the pain.

602
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,302
I decided to go up there alone

603
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:47,140
and beat myself up on the Wall
as just a way to cope.

604
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,780
I walked around the back
to the top of El Cap.

605
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,986
I started rappelling down
from above.

606
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,618
And I put in a camp
so I could stay up there.

607
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,120
And I started going
through this process

608
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:10,079
of searching for a way to climb
this section of the Wall.

609
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,551
The specific path
was totally unknown.

610
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,681
You look for weaknesses
in the rock.

611
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,851
Corners that you can wedge
your body into.

612
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,555
Cracks for your hands and toes.

613
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,311
Little edges
for your fingertips.

614
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,518
Anything that you could
possibly grab onto

615
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,195
that would make this wall
climbable.

616
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,951
At first, it was just
hanging on the rope,

617
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,243
analyzing the surface
of the rock

618
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,415
to see if there was holds.

619
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,255
Just finding something
to obsess about

620
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,835
so I wouldn't obsess
about my divorce.

621
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,261
I think
it's probably important

622
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,682
that it was an impossible level
of rock climbing.

623
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:07,511
When you absorb yourself
in some magnificent challenge,

624
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,564
there is no space to be thinking
about anything else.

625
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,686
You know,
if you're heartbroken,

626
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,944
just throw yourself
into an impossible wall.

627
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,151
So I was sitting
up there through this storm.

628
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,202
My wife has left me.

629
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,576
She was the only person
I had climbed with

630
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,408
for, like, ten years.

631
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,707
In my portaledge at night,

632
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,380
weeping and really
feeling sorry for myself,

633
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,629
trying to find
this elusive thing

634
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,551
that probably didn't even exist.

635
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,426
I was concerned.

636
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,804
He just seemed to be suffering
at that point.

637
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,056
And I wanted to see
what this was all about,

638
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,730
so early on in the game
I went up there with him.

639
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,979
I convinced my dad
to come up there and belay me,

640
00:35:55,195 --> 00:36:00,065
so I could start actually trying
to climb sections of the route.

641
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,489
What the heck?

642
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,287
I really had my doubts
as to whether it was going to be

643
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,285
a viable climb.

644
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,662
- Be safe.
- I will.

645
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,538
- Get strong.
- Yup.

646
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,665
But during that period of time,

647
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,090
he became convinced
that it was somehow possible.

648
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,340
Tommy spent
an entire year

649
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:26,219
swinging around looking
for a route up the Dawn Wall,

650
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,435
trying to connect the dots

651
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,888
from the bottom
all the way to the top

652
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:37,352
so you can someday hope
to free climb the whole thing.

653
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,937
Eventually,
I found a route

654
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,444
that seemed like it was
theoretically possible,

655
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,867
like I found the path
through the maze maybe.

656
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,111
But I realized

657
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,948
there was no way I was going
to be able to do this alone.

658
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,161
It's just a monumental project.

659
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,089
Without Beth,
I needed to find a partner,

660
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,627
somebody that I could rely on

661
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,888
to help me solve this puzzle.

662
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,166
I should wake Kevin up
with some coffee.

663
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,001
Just stretching.

664
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,002
That's a good idea.

665
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,550
I felt a little rugged
when I first woke up.

666
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,878
But how are you feeling?

667
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,259
Still stuffy and sore throat.
Kind of achy.

668
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,263
I think I got
whatever you got.

669
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,558
After the first
couple of days on the Wall,

670
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,110
there's a small little cadre
of people down in the meadow

671
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,313
following their progress.

672
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,614
You can get a telescope
or a pair of binoculars,

673
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,442
look up at this spectacle
happening.

674
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,992
Oh, my God.

675
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,913
Is he naked or what?

676
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,828
My name is Tom Evans.
I've been

677
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,456
for many years photographing
climbers on El Cap.

678
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,332
I usually don't come
in the winter,

679
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,630
but this is big news
in climbing.

680
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,833
And we've all been pulling
for him for many years.

681
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,543
I was on
a little vacation from work,

682
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,504
and I decided to come out
from Sacramento

683
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,055
to watch these guys climb
the Dawn Wall.

684
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,224
It's definitely
a moment in history.

685
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,347
To be able to be a part of that
and witness it

686
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,894
is pretty phenomenal.

687
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,271
Pushing forward.

688
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:46,947
From here on up,
every pitch is pretty legit.

689
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,277
We've got to pace ourselves.

690
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,783
Maybe one or two pitches a day.

691
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,494
Come on, Tommy.

692
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,207
Good.

693
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,708
Good, Tommy. Come on.

694
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,341
Nice.

695
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,043
Yeah.

696
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,265
Come on.

697
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,967
You got it.

698
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,803
Yeah. Yeah, Kevin.

699
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,480
Nice, dude.

700
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,683
- Cool.
- Dude, that was sick.

701
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:27,191
It's day three on the Wall,
and we sent pitch 10.

702
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,189
Yeah!

703
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:30,991
Yeah. Boom.

704
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,113
- Things are going good.
- Things are going good.

705
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,784
And the forecast
is calling

706
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,412
for super cold windy temps
tomorrow,

707
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,288
so we're going to rest.

708
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,751
Urgent weather message.

709
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,756
Winds, 50 miles per hour
with gusts 75 or higher.

710
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:53,134
Impact... downed trees,
downed power lines,

711
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,215
flying portaledges.

712
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,853
These guys are up there
in the middle of winter,

713
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,726
which is almost unheard of.

714
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,933
But they need it to be
as cold as possible

715
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,861
so they can stick
to the tiny holds

716
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,983
There's nobody else on the Wall.

717
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,863
Last night, the temperature
dropped 30 degrees.

718
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,285
To be up there
under these conditions,

719
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,285
it's horrendous.
I don't know how they do it.

720
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,710
Carabiners, locked

721
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,132
The windchill's like
negative 20 or something.

722
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,084
How you feeling over there, KJ?

723
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,050
It's getting pretty rowdy.

724
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,974
On El Cap, the wind
blows straight up the wall.

725
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:41,304
The ledge would float up
and, bang, back into the wall.

726
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,858
Oh, boy.

727
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,313
Tommy
feels right at home.

728
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,068
Argh!

729
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,610
I don't know what's
wrong with me,

730
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,536
but I love this shit.

731
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:05,453
It might be smart
to stay in the ledges today.

732
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:11,417
Because of the windstorm
the day before,

733
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,718
all of this moisture froze,

734
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,139
like salt on a Margarita glass
on the top of El Cap.

735
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,263
And as soon as the sun
hit the top of the Wall,

736
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:26,895
that ice just started
to shower down on top of us.

737
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,364
These missiles
flying by our camp.

738
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,408
You hear it before you see it.

739
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,408
I'm like,
this is a deadly situation.

740
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,784
- That was fucked up.
- Did you get hit?

741
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,789
No,
but that was just pure luck.

742
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,420
That was scary.

743
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,122
I hate that shit.

744
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,380
Here come some more big
chunks. Tommy forgot his helmet.

745
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,461
Heads up, Tommy.

746
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,683
Tommy doesn't seem
too concerned. What the fuck?

747
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,476
What's new?

748
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,897
Tommy, he was made
for something like this.

749
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:12,649
But for me, it took a long time
to get comfortable on the Wall.

750
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,526
You can understand,
Tommy grew up in the mountains.

751
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:18,279
He'd spent the better part
of his adult life

752
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,282
on El Capitan
trying to do free climbs.

753
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:25,661
But this guy Kevin was raised
in Santa Rosa, I think.

754
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,369
You know, wine country.

755
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,831
There's not a lot
of rock climbing in Santa Rosa.

756
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,257
- First ascent.
- Yeah!

757
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,461
Don't fall on the Camaro.

758
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,969
I found climbing
through the local gym.

759
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,267
- Bye, honey. Have fun.
- Bye, Mom.

760
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:45,810
Drive careful.

761
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,979
I got really into
this particular form of climbing

762
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,023
called bouldering.

763
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,226
It's typically 30 feet or less.

764
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,858
Doesn't require any gear.

765
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,566
Bouldering's just about
athleticism

766
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:01,026
and difficulty
in its purest form.

767
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,697
Bouldering is all about

768
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,249
trying the hardest
individual moves.

769
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,418
And Kevin quickly became
very, very talented.

770
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,675
He was one of the best
in the world.

771
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,676
But only up to about
30 feet.

772
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:28,308
In 2009, I was at
the top of my game in bouldering

773
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,107
and looking for something new.

774
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,987
I kept hearing about
this futuristic thing

775
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,190
that Tommy was working on.

776
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,525
I had zero big wall experience.

777
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,406
Tommy and I
didn't know each other at all.

778
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,863
But I just sent him a message
out of the blue.

779
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,619
"Hey, do you need a partner?"

780
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:52,328
And to my utter shock, he said,
meet me in Yosemite in October.

781
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,709
I knew Kevin
by reputation.

782
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,462
He was this amazingly strong
bouldering kid.

783
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,294
And I thought to myself,
"What the heck?"

784
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,675
"Maybe he could be an asset."

785
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,756
Plus, he was the only one
interested.

786
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,559
Everybody else
thought I was crazy.

787
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,436
Show up.

788
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,355
I remember standing there
with Tommy,

789
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,023
who's a legend figure
in my life.

790
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,772
I feel like such a fucking dork.

791
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,150
Who am I?
I've never climbed El Cap.

792
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,776
What a noob.

793
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,153
Fiddling around on boulders,

794
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,325
that's a far cry
from being on El Capitan.

795
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:27,325
First thing I had to do
was test him.

796
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,699
I gave him like
an 80 pound haul bag.

797
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,625
A soul crushing load.

798
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,419
We hiked
to the top of El Cap.

799
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,291
We spent the night on top.

800
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,043
Woke up early the next day...

801
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,421
It's 3:15
in the morning.

802
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:41,922
Cooking up a little breakfast.

803
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,300
You never get up at 3:00
in the morning to go bouldering.

804
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,516
...and start rappelling
down the face.

805
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,689
You start walking backwards.

806
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,893
It's like stepping off
the edge of the Earth.

807
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,696
You instantly have 3,000 feet
of exposure under your butt.

808
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,158
Oh, my God!

809
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,129
How's it going
up there, Kev?

810
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,298
- Good, I got the bag.
- And my shoes?

811
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,922
- And your shoes.
- Cool, thank you.

812
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,846
It's scary to be a total
beginner again.

813
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,765
I don't know any of this stuff.

814
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:33,353
Trying to figure out
how to jumar a fixed line.

815
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,728
How to set up a portaledge.

816
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,900
Sorry, Kevin.

817
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,407
I'll just hold
this quarter in. It's cool.

818
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:53,706
How to take a dump
on the side of the Wall.

819
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,410
- They get every moment.
- Close up.

820
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,925
At this point, I have
no idea what I'm getting into,

821
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,504
no idea that it's about
to consume six years of my life.

822
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,433
When Kevin
joined on with Tommy,

823
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,512
it was the first time
since getting divorced

824
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,768
that Tommy had a partner.

825
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,976
There's two bolts
and then an old bolt.

826
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,733
I didn't know
what we were up against,

827
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:28,362
but I was going on faith
that this is Tommy's world.

828
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:32,115
He's got the clear vision
of what this could be.

829
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,618
And I'm just going
to trust that.

830
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,997
The basic strategy
early on

831
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,124
was not to climb the route
from the bottom.

832
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,707
It was to identify
the hardest sections

833
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,462
and focus on those first.

834
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,919
There were
all these question marks.

835
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,721
Come on, Tommy.

836
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,468
OK, take it there.

837
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,016
Oh, I got the pinch with my
right hand instead of my left.

838
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,434
Working it out.

839
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,102
Constantly working it out.

840
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,979
Early on, most of it was
figuring out what didn't work.

841
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,365
Right in the middle of the Wall,

842
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,614
we were gonna have to
traverse it sideways.

843
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,411
Come on.

844
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,662
Come on.

845
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,494
I don't see any holds,

846
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:23,796
but I try to harness
some of Tommy's optimism.

847
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,379
After the traverse,

848
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:30,462
there's this 8 and 1/2 foot
blank section.

849
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,046
Completely smooth.

850
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,099
Nothing that you could even
get your fingernails behind.

851
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:37,302
The only way was to just leap.

852
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,938
This crazy dynamic move.

853
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,265
The Dyno.

854
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,975
I didn't really believe
it would be possible

855
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,481
until I saw Kevin try it.

856
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,564
Yeah, man. It was close.

857
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,445
He showed me that it was.

858
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,448
Come on. All you got.

859
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,200
Above the Dyno,
you have pitch after pitch

860
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,952
of have super smooth granite,

861
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,829
extremely polished.

862
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,079
Because of Tommy's
missing index finger,

863
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,461
he's using his thumbs
in crazy ways.

864
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,296
Shit.

865
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,302
Argh!

866
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,309
Holy crap, that is hard.

867
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,388
13B. 13D.

868
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,644
13C. 14A.

869
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,726
To understand
the difficulty of this route,

870
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:31,315
you have to understand
climbing grades.

871
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,400
Climbers use a numerical system

872
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,826
to rate the difficulty
of each pitch.

873
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,700
The higher the number,
the harder the pitch.

874
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,954
Once you get into
513 and 514 level,

875
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,910
that's virtuoso territory.

876
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,997
The Dawn Wall
has more hard pitches

877
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:51,801
than every other route
on El Cap combined.

878
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,432
I always thought it was futile

879
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,308
in terms of doing
the whole thing.

880
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,394
This is a pipe dream, man.
Come on.

881
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,320
The next few years
were a grind.

882
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:16,652
Coming back every spring and
every fall for months at a time.

883
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:22,494
Come on.

884
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,374
Living on the Wall
takes a huge toll.

885
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,797
This is what El Cap
does to your feet.

886
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:31,966
We'd stay up there
a few days...

887
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,670
Oh, my God.
That's a lot of air time.

888
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,382
...go down, rest,

889
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:39,636
try again.

890
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:42,594
There were always
new problems to face.

891
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,928
Get out of here!

892
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,191
Come on, Kevin.
Do it, man.

893
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:51,857
- Really close.
- Oh, I sprained my ankle.

894
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,608
- Are you OK, man?
- Oh, shit.

895
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,065
So many reasons
to give up.

896
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,034
Oh, shit.

897
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,455
Man, I think I have
broke or dislocated ribs.

898
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,031
We're heading to the clinic.

899
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,582
Maybe they'll just
pop it back in.

900
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,252
They will, and
we'll go back up later tonight.

901
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,338
But Tommy was committed.

902
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,793
Come on, Kevin!
Come on!

903
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,344
There were times
I thought he was totally crazy.

904
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,342
Come on!

905
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,058
<i>'Lee-hoe!</i>

906
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,103
<i>Whoa'. Ow-ow!</i>

907
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:32,978
When we weren't
together on the Wall,

908
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,313
we would go home
to our own worlds,

909
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,782
check in on loved ones.

910
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,072
It's gross. I can see the oil
on your hair.

911
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,076
OK, I'm just totally
being a mom.

912
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,664
Try to get some good rest

913
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:57,093
and find motivation
for the next round of attempts.

914
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,472
When I wasn't
on the Dawn Wall,

915
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:05,803
I was living by myself
in Colorado,

916
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,228
training and obsessing.

917
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,522
I was really lonely, honestly.

918
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,810
I met this girl named Becca.

919
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,394
We started dating.

920
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,981
He was thoughtful
and considerate,

921
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,158
but from the beginning,
it was pretty obvious

922
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:25,864
his mind was completely occupied
by the Dawn Wall.

923
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,539
It wasn't just a climb.

924
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,872
It was all consuming.

925
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,253
We were trying to build
a relationship.

926
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,256
But he would go out to Yosemite
for months at a time,

927
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,929
giving everything
to the Dawn Wall.

928
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:48,602
For years,
Tommy put his whole life on hold

929
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:52,603
so he could give every
last ounce of his body and soul

930
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:58,233
to this impossible quest.

931
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:01,157
I could never tell
if we were wasting our time

932
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,952
or we were in pursuit
of something grand.

933
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,199
Come on!

934
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,622
I'd go out to Yosemite

935
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,373
and I'd watch him
from the meadow.

936
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:14,954
It looked completely ridiculous.

937
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,881
Ah, shoot.

938
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,460
I think we all admire people
who are dedicated.

939
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,421
But at some point,
you start to wonder,

940
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:27,179
where are the lines between
dedication and obsession?

941
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:34,645
He was going
through emotional agony.

942
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,477
This climb has been
gut wrenching.

943
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,858
I want this for him so badly.

944
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,441
Argh!

945
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,526
- Oh, he fell off.
- Oh.

946
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:48,158
Man. I mean, you've
failed on this thing 800 times.

947
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:51,742
How can you continue to beat
your head against this wall?

948
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,371
After years of effort,

949
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,625
it didn't feel like we were
any closer to our dream.

950
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,832
He's worked so hard.

951
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,793
Why am I crying right now?

952
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,174
This project! Argh!

953
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,471
This makes me wonder

954
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,014
if he bit off
more than he could chew.

955
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,388
Oh, it's so good
to have you down.

956
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,889
After all this failure,
I started to wonder

957
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,067
if maybe this climb
really was impossible.

958
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,153
Maybe I wasn't good enough.

959
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,419
- Morning.
- Morning.

960
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,180
Tommy and Kevin have been
up there, this is their 8th day.

961
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,258
They're halfway up the Wall.

962
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,845
They got past 70 mile an hour
winds, the ice falls.

963
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,975
They climbed
a lot of difficult rock.

964
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:59,058
Now they've got today
a very hard section to do.

965
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,861
They're here. They've got to go
across this traverse.

966
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,154
14D, I think it is.

967
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:08,360
If they can get that done,
they're well on their way.

968
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:15,249
The hardest individual
part of this 3,000 foot puzzle

969
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,953
is the traverse.

970
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,458
The bottom section of the route

971
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:24,258
follows a vague series of cracks
and corners in the rock.

972
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:29,180
But after 1,000 feet, those
cracks and corners dead end.

973
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,258
300 feet to the left, there's
another series of features

974
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,435
that angles up to the top.

975
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:36,937
The trick is,

976
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,436
how do you traverse
this 300 foot blank section

977
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,608
right in the middle of the Wall?

978
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,777
There's
this band of rock

979
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,900
that's a slightly different
color and texture.

980
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,698
Everything
above and below it

981
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,366
is impossible to free climb.

982
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,785
But the composition of that band

983
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:55,035
is such that it has
a few holds on it.

984
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:59,790
Over the last six years,
we spent over 100 days

985
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,212
trying to get across
this traverse.

986
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,540
Thousands of tries
on that single pitch.

987
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,673
I've never done it.

988
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,630
Now we have to do it
for the very first time...

989
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,841
Looks like
Tommy's getting ready.

990
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:16,428
...in the moment,
on the push.

991
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:18,888
Go get it.

992
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,362
It's really unnerving.

993
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,784
You're just waiting to slip off
at any moment.

994
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,495
It's kind of funny.

995
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:47,208
This 3,000 foot wall, and
it's coming down to millimeters

996
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,385
of skin contact
on your fingertips.

997
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,760
It becomes
such a zoomed-in world.

998
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,593
There's one way
to get across,

999
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:59,349
and it is made up of
all these little sequences

1000
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,852
that have to be done perfectly.

1001
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,024
You miss a hold,
it's impossible.

1002
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,977
Yeah, dude.

1003
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,528
You grab it wrong,
it's impossible.

1004
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,730
Nice.

1005
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:15,285
We're trading attempts.

1006
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,825
Tommy ties in
and just flips that switch.

1007
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,829
Alright.
Go get it, Tommy.

1008
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,711
You grab
these sharp holds,

1009
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,467
like razor blades.

1010
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,427
Come on!

1011
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,351
Span as far as you can.

1012
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,352
Come on!

1013
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,196
So stretched out.

1014
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,330
I suddenly felt this confidence.

1015
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:58,306
I knew exactly how each finger
was going onto each hold,

1016
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:02,727
where the little ripples on the
rock were digging into my shoes.

1017
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:17,525
After years of working
on that pitch,

1018
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,452
it just came together
in this amazing, magical way.

1019
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,200
Yes, come on!

1020
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:23,781
Come on!

1021
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,083
Whoa!

1022
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,332
Whoo!

1023
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,502
Ow-ow-ow-ow!

1024
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:39,009
When I heard
that Tommy had done pitch 15,

1025
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,932
that was like,
"You've got to be kidding me!"

1026
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,598
For the first time,

1027
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:49,148
these guys actually have a shot
at maybe doing this thing.

1028
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,644
When Tommy got across,

1029
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,855
it was a big moment.

1030
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:59,533
Everything was rolling,
and now it was my turn.

1031
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,790
Over the years, we realized

1032
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:14,124
sometimes the best conditions
are at night.

1033
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,172
It's colder. It's drier.

1034
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,720
So there's better friction
on the rock.

1035
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,887
At first, it's scary.

1036
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,562
But after a while, you forget
how high off the ground you are

1037
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:31,812
and you can focus
just on the climbing.

1038
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,711
Tried it a few times.

1039
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,582
I wasn't that close.

1040
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:59,965
We rappelled back to our camp
below the traverse.

1041
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:05,549
I was stoked for Tommy,
a little stressed for myself.

1042
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,514
So Tommy's made it
through the traverse.

1043
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,100
He still has to get
past the Dyno

1044
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,651
and the Long Run to Wino Tower.

1045
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:25,152
But first, he has to wait
for Kevin to catch up.

1046
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:40,964
Hello?

1047
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,590
'Hey, guys. This is
John Branch from the NY Times.

1048
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:44,888
- 'How's it going up there?'
- Good, John.

1049
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,558
'Tommy, I know that
you made it to 15 last night.

1050
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,180
'It's very exciting,

1051
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,057
'so I appreciate you guys taking
just a few minutes to talk.'

1052
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,389
We're always looking for stories
that are a little bit

1053
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,064
out of the mainstream
sports realm.

1054
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,813
Every time we start
a hard pitch...

1055
01:00:57,028 --> 01:01:00,396
I knew about the Dawn
Wall and Tommy Caldwell's quest.

1056
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,698
And when I heard that
Tommy did pitch 15, I thought,

1057
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,992
if it was ever going to happen,
this might be the time.

1058
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,490
We recognized

1059
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,947
this is not only the best
climbing story of the year,

1060
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,202
but maybe of our generation.

1061
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,000
'We talked about
follow-up stories.'

1062
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,326
Quickly typed up a story.

1063
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:17,789
The next day,
it ran in the paper.

1064
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,840
It was on the front page
of The New York Times,

1065
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,382
and it just exploded.

1066
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,553
It was the most viewed
story at nytimes.com.

1067
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,254
Tons of comments.
Lots of questions.

1068
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,259
People care about this.

1069
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,965
When John Branch,

1070
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,518
the Pulitzer Prize winning
journalist, got a hold of it,

1071
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,438
it just got its own momentum.

1072
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,356
And it just got bigger
and bigger from there.

1073
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:38,559
There was
follow-up stories

1074
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,815
and a flood of media requests

1075
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:44,069
from every major news outlet
in the world.

1076
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:46,696
Picture this.
Our next guests talk to us

1077
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:49,529
as they were suspended
high up in mid air.

1078
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:52,365
'We're sitting in a
portaledge, which is basically'

1079
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,916
a hanging cot
with an aluminum frame.

1080
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,335
That's professional
climber Tommy Caldwell

1081
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,333
ten days into what's considered

1082
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,961
one of the world's most daunting
climbing challenges.

1083
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,713
This is crazy.

1084
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,135
'Best of luck.'

1085
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:06,837
Great.
Thank you so much.

1086
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,890
Guess we hang up.
I don't really know.

1087
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:16,772
They don't tell us what to do
when it's over.

1088
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,601
Oh, my God!

1089
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,310
How many days does it take?

1090
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,861
All of a sudden,

1091
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,031
there are crowds of people
congregating in the Valley.

1092
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:29,110
Let's turn now to this historic
feat by two American climbers.

1093
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:31,161
Perched on a cliff
above Yosemite.

1094
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,865
The famously steep face
of El Capitan.

1095
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:37,418
The whole media thing
was very strange for me.

1096
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:38,960
The climb of the century.

1097
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,253
It's just been extraordinary.

1098
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,456
A real cliffhanger.
Did I just say that?

1099
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,587
They were just saying
these ludicrous things.

1100
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:46,214
- Two American hikers.
- Daredevils.

1101
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,669
- Thrill seekers.
- Adrenaline junkies.

1102
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,800
Scaling the cliff
known as El Capitan.

1103
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,427
That's not even El Cap.

1104
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,850
Inching up
without any climbing tools.

1105
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:56,895
I'm wearing pretty much the same
gear as the guys up in Yosemite.

1106
01:02:57,107 --> 01:03:00,725
I like the second picture,
so we'll hover here.

1107
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,561
The Dawn Wall was always
this personal journey.

1108
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,487
This was a bad idea.

1109
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:07,527
And obviously,

1110
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,608
this turned into something
very different from that.

1111
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:11,660
So don't understand
how they could possibly do it.

1112
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,737
I hope they make it,
but I don't understand it.

1113
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:14,992
It's the challenge.

1114
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,666
Yeah, the challenge of it.
No, thanks.

1115
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:21,120
Suddenly, the whole
world was watching this climb.

1116
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,923
Which wasn't the
best timing for me personally,

1117
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,632
because I still
had to do pitch 15.

1118
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:34,467
At this point,
they've established a base camp

1119
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,893
a couple of hundred feet
below the traverse.

1120
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:38,436
So when Kevin's ready to climb,

1121
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,265
they go up the fixed ropes
to the start of pitch 15.

1122
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:46,778
Tommy sets up his belay,

1123
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:50,199
and Kevin tries
to get across this thing.

1124
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,777
Here would be actually
a big moment on the climb.

1125
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,987
Drove all the way out here today
just to see this.

1126
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:00,041
It was important
to get through pitch 15

1127
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,369
and catch up
to Tommy's high point

1128
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,330
as soon as possible.

1129
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,263
Come on, Kev.
You got it.

1130
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,433
Oh!

1131
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,641
Every fall, you go back
to the start of the pitch,

1132
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,102
rest for at least an hour...

1133
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,114
...try again.

1134
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,908
Every attempt,
you wear off more skin.

1135
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,454
You run out of
a little more energy.

1136
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,867
Everything was going smoothly

1137
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,499
until Jorgeson
couldn't grasp pitch 15.

1138
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,546
Stopped by the
sheer difficulty of the climb.

1139
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,044
As the razor-sharp handholds

1140
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,715
tore the skin
off his fingertips.

1141
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,259
So everyone's tuning in

1142
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,553
in the middle of guys living
on the side of the Wall...

1143
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:56,223
History is on hold
in Yosemite National Park.

1144
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:57,799
...and one of them's stuck.

1145
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,384
Argh!

1146
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,936
Kevin Jorgeson is stuck.

1147
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,105
- That was close, dude.
- I know.

1148
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,275
You just started to
fall apart a little bit there.

1149
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,569
It's a pretty
fascinating drama

1150
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:13,365
unfolding in real time,
literally in front of our eyes.

1151
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,193
People who I'm sure
had no idea what a pitch was

1152
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,745
were now going, "Pitch 15!
Come on, Kevin! You can do it!"

1153
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,450
You'll get it, dude.
That was really close.

1154
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,253
I spent a few days
not climbing,

1155
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:30,002
just belaying Kevin
over and over again on pitch 15.

1156
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,806
It was harder than any pitch
of climbing he'd ever done.

1157
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,600
Fucker!

1158
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:43,554
He just kept falling
and falling.

1159
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,936
I had honestly started to lose
hope that he was going to do it.

1160
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,814
Last night
was my third day

1161
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,691
of battle with pitch 15.

1162
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:57,071
Still didn't do it.

1163
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:01,872
After trying so many times,
I've destroyed my fingers.

1164
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:07,328
So I decided to take a rest day
and let my fingers heal.

1165
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:16,379
Meanwhile,
Tommy hasn't climbed for days.

1166
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:18,968
And he has to be thinking,

1167
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:22,393
I can't stay up here
indefinitely waiting for Kevin.

1168
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:24,595
I mean, there's
very few people in the world

1169
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,727
that have ever even spent
that much time on a wall.

1170
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,730
Living on the Wall
just wears you down.

1171
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,356
It's just harsh up there.

1172
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,108
You can't even walk.

1173
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,065
You're not sleeping great
at night.

1174
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:40,198
You're not eating normal foods,
drinking enough water.

1175
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,701
It's hard to climb your best
under those conditions.

1176
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:47,285
Every day that goes by,
maybe Tommy suddenly gets sick.

1177
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:48,744
Maybe the weather changes.

1178
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:52,081
I felt like
I had to continue.

1179
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,587
So they devised a plan.

1180
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,385
Tommy's going to press on
and try the Dyno pitch,

1181
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:00,635
hoping that Kevin
eventually will get across 15

1182
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,682
and he can catch up.

1183
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:05,431
That night,
we go up our fixed lines

1184
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,730
and I belay Tommy on pitch 16,
the Dyno pitch.

1185
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,391
I had tried
the Dyno move

1186
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,568
hundreds of times
over the years.

1187
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:18,815
Never done it.

1188
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,902
I'd rebuilt it on the shed
at my home,

1189
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:25,830
so I could just practice
this one stupid move.

1190
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,874
Just before we went
for our final push,

1191
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:29,497
I was completely frustrated,

1192
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,704
staring at these photos
of the Wall.

1193
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:37,168
I started to notice cracks and
edges that go down and around.

1194
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:39,469
So I came up with this idea

1195
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:42,469
to do the most ridiculous
pitch of climbing.

1196
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:45,472
His idea was to
just climb in a giant circle

1197
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,849
around the Dyno.
I was like, "Really?"

1198
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,805
So to get around
about eight feet...?

1199
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,607
Yeah, climb like 200.

1200
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:56,778
Tommy's currently working out
the world's hardest down climb.

1201
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:00,733
We do hard moves going straight
up, hard moves going sideways.

1202
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:01,987
I should add a down climb.

1203
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:04,865
That way, we
just get the full package.

1204
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,786
Down climbing,
it's so unnatural.

1205
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:10,117
Falling.

1206
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,169
It's like
running backwards.

1207
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:16,965
That felt horrible.

1208
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:35,980
Good, Tommy.

1209
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,862
Nice.

1210
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:47,412
Come on. Focus.

1211
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:51,116
Good.

1212
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,786
This loop pitch,

1213
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:58,419
it's like walking around
the block to cross the street.

1214
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,842
It is just a little bit
ridiculous.

1215
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,387
But it's also kind of brilliant.

1216
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:05,805
Come on.

1217
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:07,678
Come on.

1218
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,932
This thing that had been
shutting him down

1219
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,388
for all these years,

1220
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:17,397
and then he just looks at it
with a new set of eyes

1221
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:19,728
and finds a new solution.

1222
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,483
Yeah.

1223
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,281
The Dyno!

1224
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,950
Whoo!

1225
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,632
How is the skin, dude?

1226
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:45,253
It's not healing very quickly,

1227
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:48,556
which is frustrating.

1228
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:52,853
While Kevin's waiting
for his fingers to heal,

1229
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:57,058
Tommy continued pushing
the route higher and higher.

1230
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,812
What you do every day is,

1231
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,939
you get to a high point,
and then you leave fixed ropes

1232
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:02,611
that go back down to the camp.

1233
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:06,067
The next day, you motor back up
the ropes to the high point

1234
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:07,946
and then carry on.

1235
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,994
So, even though
they might be working

1236
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,913
on different parts of the Wall,

1237
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,457
they're doing it together.
Kevin belays Tommy,

1238
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:18,583
and once Tommy's done, they
both go back down to the camp.

1239
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,333
Tommy's just forging on.

1240
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:36,555
Every pitch gets him further
away from where I'm stuck.

1241
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,356
One more down.

1242
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,061
There's so much distance
between our high points

1243
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,317
that I'm not going to be able
to close that gap

1244
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:46,523
in a reasonable amount of time

1245
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,325
unless I do this.

1246
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,527
Every time I would
look over in his portaledge,

1247
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,613
he would just be following
news updates,

1248
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,743
staring at his fingertips,

1249
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,370
mumbling to himself.

1250
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:59,374
Trying to convince
myself these actually look good.

1251
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,628
Tommy, do you have
the Ibuprofen?

1252
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,919
Oh, yeah.

1253
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:12,007
After two days resting,
I felt resolved.

1254
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,260
This was the day
it had to happen.

1255
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:19,597
It's still pretty warm out.

1256
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,683
And so I'm going to wait
a few more hours

1257
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:23,519
for the temperatures
to drop even more

1258
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:26,901
to give myself
every bit of friction you can.

1259
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,277
You ready?

1260
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:31,326
Ready
as I'm ever going to be.

1261
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:56,134
I've been waiting for days
for the skin to heal,

1262
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,263
for this moment to come.

1263
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,114
There's a nice cold breeze
blowing up the wall.

1264
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,202
I felt weightless.

1265
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:17,747
I was just floating
across the pitch.

1266
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:33,638
Hold it together.

1267
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,442
Come on, Kevin.
Do it, man.

1268
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:47,894
You got it.

1269
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,317
Come on.

1270
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,365
You got it.

1271
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:53,988
Come on. Find it.

1272
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,739
Good.
Come on.

1273
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,738
Argh!

1274
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,492
Oh,
that was so good, dude.

1275
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:08,965
Everything was perfect,
and I still didn't do it.

1276
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:11,546
Come on, Kevin.

1277
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,969
I tried four times
that night.

1278
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,256
Fucker!

1279
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,182
He's off.

1280
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,930
I just kept falling.

1281
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:26,023
Shit!

1282
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,563
Tonight...

1283
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,689
...didn't go so well.

1284
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,111
It was a battle,
and I didn't win.

1285
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,493
It was pretty clear
that that was it.

1286
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,915
Like, you had your chance.

1287
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:45,118
You weren't good enough.

1288
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,204
Yeah, it's pretty fucked.

1289
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:53,426
Now you're the guy that
almost climbed the Dawn Wall.

1290
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,629
So how much did you enjoy
that process?

1291
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,805
Because that's all you get.

1292
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:06,515
Editors and I
started talking.

1293
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,566
Is it now time to do a story
about what happens

1294
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,234
if he doesn't make it?

1295
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,982
We all want happy endings, but
as a journalist, you're like,

1296
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:13,814
"That's an incredible story."

1297
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:16,616
What's the ethos in climbing?

1298
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,285
Do you say,
you go ahead without me?

1299
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:20,987
Do you leave a guy behind?

1300
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,743
Are they having
this conversation

1301
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,075
in the portaledge at night?

1302
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,927
This would be nice
to check the radar.

1303
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:47,264
The next day, the
weather was starting to get bad.

1304
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:50,900
And I knew what I needed to do.

1305
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,360
20%.

1306
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:54,903
Today?

1307
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:57,778
Next like four days.

1308
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,905
I'm just going to
throw in the towel

1309
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,158
and support Tommy to the top.

1310
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:06,916
From here on out,

1311
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,618
Kevin's just
going to belay Tommy

1312
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,374
and follow him up the ropes.

1313
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:14,624
So they go up
to Tommy's high point,

1314
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,926
where he starts up
the last hard pitches

1315
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:19,129
of the long run to Wino Tower.

1316
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:28,388
There I was,
watching Tommy

1317
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,598
climb with so much confidence

1318
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:33,480
toward the completion
of this dream.

1319
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:40,658
Even if I can't do this,
I was really happy for Tommy.

1320
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,406
What a special moment

1321
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,582
to witness
this piece of history.

1322
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:57,209
And I was there to help Tommy
realize this vision.

1323
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:08,053
After everything
he went through,

1324
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,440
so much struggle,

1325
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,856
the injuries, the doubts.

1326
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,861
For Tommy it was like,
this is it.

1327
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,454
Come on, Tommy.

1328
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,163
Boom!

1329
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:35,831
Woo-hoo!
Feels good.

1330
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,670
I'm down in the meadow

1331
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:41,093
watching Tommy
trying to get to Wino Tower,

1332
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,842
which is the next big feature
above them.

1333
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,844
It's this mythical landmark

1334
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,018
about two-thirds of the way
up El Capitan.

1335
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:53,064
This three foot pedestal
2,000 feet up the Wall.

1336
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,391
The first horizontal ledge

1337
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,774
where you can stand up,
sit down, lie down

1338
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,775
on the entire route.

1339
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:04,109
And it signifies
the end of the hardest climbing.

1340
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:08,780
One more hard pitch
to get to Wino Tower.

1341
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,455
That's crazy!

1342
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:14,457
For years, I'd envisioned this
moment of getting to Wino Tower.

1343
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:16,128
So I'm freaking out inside.

1344
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,830
Good, Tommy. Come on.

1345
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:21,259
Climbing really tense
and kind of shaking nervous.

1346
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,801
Keep breathing, dude.

1347
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,184
Come on.

1348
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,179
Good.

1349
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:40,020
Just trying
to calm myself down enough

1350
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,651
to make it through
the final last little bit.

1351
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,370
Yeah!

1352
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,176
Ow!

1353
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,440
Oh!
I feel a little shaky.

1354
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,445
Yeah, I might pass out.

1355
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:34,123
I can't believe
I'm here right now.

1356
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:47,671
I know it's not over yet,
but that's big.

1357
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:50,515
I'm at Wino Tower.

1358
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:01,893
What are you feeling?

1359
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:05,070
I want Kevin to experience this,
too, for sure.

1360
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:11,069
It was this huge victory.

1361
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:12,778
But it's totally trumped
by the fact

1362
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,490
that Kevin wasn't going
to do it with me.

1363
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,916
Suddenly, I just felt alone.

1364
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,587
I think Kevin probably did, too.

1365
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:28,548
What a crazy experience
this has been.

1366
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,597
It crashed down on me

1367
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:35,677
that going to the top without
Kevin was gonna be devastating.

1368
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,728
Just got to get KJ up here now.

1369
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:40,473
So I decided in that moment

1370
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:43,355
that we were going to get
to the top together.

1371
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:46,779
- What will you do?
- Everything I can to help him.

1372
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:48,277
Yeah.

1373
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:51,860
I'm going to go
into full-on support mode.

1374
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:58,408
That night, we both
go back down to the camp.

1375
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,625
We were cooking dinner.

1376
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:06,583
It was real quiet.

1377
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,920
And I knew it was
this emotional moment for Tommy.

1378
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:14,637
But he's not very good
at verbalizing.

1379
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,907
Yeah.

1380
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:43,540
Tommy just told me,
in classic Tommy style,

1381
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:48,501
I don't care how long it takes
for you to get through pitch 15,

1382
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,427
because I can't imagine
a worse outcome

1383
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:53,470
than doing this alone.

1384
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,766
I don't want to hold you back,
is the thing.

1385
01:20:56,977 --> 01:21:00,265
You're three days
from the top now or some shit.

1386
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:06,651
It's a pretty special moment.

1387
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:10,484
I know I can do that pitch.

1388
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,736
Yeah, for sure.

1389
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:16,444
And I feel like if I can do that
pitch, I'd be so fucking psyched

1390
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:17,903
that there's nothing

1391
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:20,364
that's going to stop me
between there and the top.

1392
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:22,700
I think that's true.

1393
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,581
Just keep stretching.
Make sure...

1394
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,835
I think I need to do
some arm lengthening stretches.

1395
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:31,463
So we decided that I
would rest two consecutive days

1396
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:33,260
so that my skin could heal

1397
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:34,962
and try again.

1398
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,425
The idea
of Tommy waiting,

1399
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:41,727
to risk your own success

1400
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:45,307
in the hopes that maybe
by some miracle Kevin can do it,

1401
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:46,937
that's a partner right there.

1402
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:50,736
Coffee for KJ.

1403
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:53,656
But there's no guarantee
that Kevin's ever gonna make it.

1404
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:57,906
I mean, I thought that Kevin
was maybe not going to make it.

1405
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:00,079
And I was hoping that,

1406
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,156
since this had been
a dream of Tommy's

1407
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,583
a lot longer than it had been
a dream of Kevin's,

1408
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:08,254
that Tommy would find a way
to complete this climb.

1409
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:10,923
As Tommy's friend, selfishly,

1410
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,001
I'm thinking to myself, like,

1411
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,087
"Kevin, dude, time to throw in
the towel and support Tommy."

1412
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:19,094
Somebody less gracious than
Tommy Caldwell might have said,

1413
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:21,016
"I've got to go on without you."

1414
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:23,640
But he was
committed to Kevin.

1415
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:25,346
"We're doing this together."

1416
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:30,356
And he wouldn't have been Tommy
if he'd done it any other way.

1417
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:32,357
This just in.
Those two American climbers...

1418
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:35,110
- Kevin Jorgeson.
- Kevin Jorgeson.

1419
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:36,907
Stuck for seven straight days.

1420
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,405
Caldwell
determined to wait...

1421
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,735
One of them
refusing to move higher

1422
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,162
without his partner
stuck below.

1423
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:43,489
So will they make it?

1424
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:45,416
Can you imagine?
This really is no joke.

1425
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,243
The media started
to sound like a tabloid.

1426
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:49,579
Is Jorgeson
spoiling Tommy's dreams?

1427
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:53,541
Down below, the
crowd is waiting and watching.

1428
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,508
Hey, Tommy,
what's the weather look like?

1429
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:01,637
Oh, wait. That's right,
you dropped your phone.

1430
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:03,559
Dropped my phone last night.

1431
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,762
I had my chest pocket unzipped.
It just fell out.

1432
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,349
Hopefully, I didn't kill anybody
down there.

1433
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:11,184
I'd heard that Tommy dropped
his phone, and I said,

1434
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:12,939
"Did he really drop his phone?"

1435
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:15,317
"Or is he just saying,
don't call me anymore?"

1436
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:18,149
So fed up with the media circus.

1437
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:20,200
I think he didn't drop it.

1438
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,699
He threw it off.

1439
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:26,249
Yup. Guess we've got to just
enjoy the view now.

1440
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:31,412
Over the next few days,

1441
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:35,170
Tommy was content
right where we were,

1442
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:37,376
for however long
it was going to be.

1443
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,588
He's just stoked to be up there,

1444
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:43,390
and it's no big deal if it takes
another rest day or two

1445
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,639
or three or five or whatever.

1446
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,437
Yeah, I feel like I've
just been appreciating things

1447
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:51,391
a little bit more
the last few days.

1448
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,523
Ah, sun.

1449
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:57,651
Tommy basically said,
"No hurry. I'm patient."

1450
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:00,403
They're going to get through it.
Don't freak out.

1451
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,781
Don't worry about the rest
of the world that's watching.

1452
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,486
Let's tune them out.
It's just you and me.

1453
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:05,912
It became the two of them.

1454
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:08,912
I think I have to
try to front-step more,

1455
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:12,586
because when it comes time
to step on that middle foot,

1456
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:15,005
I can't front-step it or in-step
it cos this foot's in the way.

1457
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:16,457
A couple of your falls last time

1458
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,543
were just cos you couldn't find
that right foot.

1459
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:20,799
So even if it's a little bit
harder, it's going to be better.

1460
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:26,180
Tommy's attitude helped
take a bit of the pressure off.

1461
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:30,764
But I was still gonna have to do
the hardest thing I've ever done

1462
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,974
for this to end well.

1463
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,315
Trying to make history

1464
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:39,613
on one of the hardest climbs
in the world.

1465
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:41,281
<i>'N, what's the story'?</i>

1466
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:42,904
<i>U.“ Here's the story.</i>

1467
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,987
I'm only about 30 feet up,
and I've called my momma twice.

1468
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:47,412
Alright?
Can you imagine?

1469
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,331
I'm on what's called
a portaledge

1470
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:50,908
that's secured to this wall.

1471
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:53,165
These two climbers
are using one of these

1472
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:56,042
secured to a flat surface.

1473
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,169
They're having to sleep
on one of these things,

1474
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:00,672
for weeks possibly, trying
to make an impossible climb.

1475
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:03,845
And me? I have holds here
I can use to climb the wall.

1476
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:06,594
Scaling the jagged
cliff known as El Capitan...

1477
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,471
Who is that, Fitz?

1478
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,519
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

1479
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:13,393
Getting on the airplane.

1480
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:17,105
Fitz and I have been home

1481
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:21,030
waiting for our moment to get
on a plane and get out here.

1482
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,357
And it's finally come.
We're here.

1483
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,286
Hey, Fitz, do you see
way up high on El Cap?

1484
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:29,613
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Can you see Daddy?

1485
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,289
After failing
for so many years,

1486
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:34,414
there was times when I
definitely felt like giving up.

1487
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:38,123
But it was actually Becca
who helped me to keep going.

1488
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:40,174
Seeing him
in his element,

1489
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:43,673
I saw this focus
and this purpose.

1490
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:45,630
I really respected him.

1491
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:48,432
And we fell in love.

1492
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:52,057
Becca became
my biggest supporter.

1493
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,478
We got married.

1494
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:56,557
And then we got pregnant
shortly after.

1495
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:58,896
Hi.

1496
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:01,399
We had a little boy
named Fitz.

1497
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,947
Hi, Fitz.

1498
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,242
The first day that I had
this little baby in my arms,

1499
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:09,695
I was overcome with the emotion.

1500
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:13,579
I thought, how am I going to be
a good example to Fitz?

1501
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:16,286
How great it is
to be a Caldwell boy.

1502
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,503
Tommy had always viewed
his dad as a superhero,

1503
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:26,053
and he wanted to be
a superhero for Fitz.

1504
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,973
I wanted Fitz to look at
me with that same sort of awe.

1505
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:38,058
I wanted to show Fitz
how to be passionate...

1506
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:39,311
Boom!

1507
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:40,893
...and how to dream big.

1508
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:42,478
He already does.

1509
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,188
The Dawn Wall
embodied that.

1510
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:47,321
And so it made me
want it even more.

1511
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:49,948
I told him,
you can't stop now.

1512
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:52,575
You have to do everything
to make this happen.

1513
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:03,420
One, two, three,
four, five.

1514
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,425
Sometimes you zoom out

1515
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:17,138
and you think about
what a process it's been,

1516
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:20,270
this wild six-year journey
with Tommy.

1517
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,146
Did Kevin start already?

1518
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:25,605
And now here we are

1519
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,565
at the moment of truth.

1520
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:30,401
And we've just been
mesmerized.

1521
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,203
Hard to put into words
something so big.

1522
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,031
He's not going to give up.

1523
01:27:57,939 --> 01:27:59,304
I couldn't imagine

1524
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:03,062
what he must have been
going through at that moment.

1525
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:36,134
I don't remember
the first 50 feet of that pitch.

1526
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:44,733
I watched him
go into the section

1527
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,061
where he had fallen
so many times.

1528
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,271
I just hold my breath.

1529
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:04,541
You pull
as hard as you can.

1530
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,666
Move your feet.

1531
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:16,841
Argh!

1532
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:19,097
You're just trying
not to tip over backwards.

1533
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:26,604
Put the heel on.

1534
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,561
Slide the hand up.

1535
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,771
Take the heel off.

1536
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:32,447
Drop the right hand in.

1537
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,196
Heel back on.

1538
01:29:35,412 --> 01:29:36,902
Left hand down.

1539
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,534
Heart rate starts to go up.

1540
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:48,831
My adrenaline starts
going, cos he's still hanging on

1541
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,917
in this place that he had fallen
so many times.

1542
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:34,085
Yeah, Kevin!

1543
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:38,714
Yeah!

1544
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:40,474
Yes!

1545
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:49,517
Watching him do it,
I was just awestruck.

1546
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:52,819
I was like, I can't believe
that just happened.

1547
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:55,655
He did it.

1548
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:58,359
Freaking guy actually
did this thing, right?

1549
01:30:58,578 --> 01:31:00,819
You're like, "What?"

1550
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:04,035
After seven days,

1551
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,617
Jorgeson got past
the most difficult...

1552
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:09,419
Past the toughest
section of the climb.

1553
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:10,871
Yes, he made it.

1554
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:12,581
And now it's upward.

1555
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:15,338
And you start thinking, are his
fingers OK? Can he do 16, 17?

1556
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,507
Is this over yet?

1557
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:20,134
I had just finished
the hardest pitch of my life,

1558
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,966
and I couldn't even celebrate.

1559
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:24,347
I just need to catch up.

1560
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:26,394
The next pitch
is this big Dyno

1561
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,096
that's so hard
that Tommy can't do it,

1562
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:29,556
he's got to climb around it.

1563
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:31,062
There's no way in hell

1564
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:33,894
that I'm going to try
Tommy's crazy loop pitch.

1565
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:38,483
So that same night I start
trying the 8 and 1/2 foot Dyno.

1566
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:41,027
Argh!

1567
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:51,753
Yeah!

1568
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:55,708
Kevin, through some kind
of magic or levitation,

1569
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:59,795
actually does this Dyno
that Tommy was never able to do.

1570
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:02,131
- So good.
- Tonight, Kevin...

1571
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,842
...now just a few
hundred feet behind Caldwell.

1572
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:07,302
All these hard pitches
just keep coming.

1573
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,058
17,18,19.

1574
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,688
It was like a fight
to the death.

1575
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:16,353
- Oh, no.
- Rock!

1576
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:17,984
That is a bad hold to rip off.

1577
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,439
Oh, man.

1578
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:22,367
I think
it's a lot harder now.

1579
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:24,286
That didn't take him too long
to figure it out.

1580
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:25,578
Nice, KJ!

1581
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,497
It's just
a little more tension.

1582
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:31,623
Like we need more of that
on this route.

1583
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:34,125
The last pitch
getting to Wino Tower,

1584
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:37,628
this crazy fog came in.

1585
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:39,426
Kevin sends this pitch
right now,

1586
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,844
he's going to be
caught up with me.

1587
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:50,637
Yes!

1588
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,188
Nice one, Kevin.

1589
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,937
I just remember
seeing Tommy at the anchor

1590
01:32:55,153 --> 01:32:58,862
and having such a huge wash
of gratefulness.

1591
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:02,692
Oh! I can't believe
we're here.

1592
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:06,323
So good, man.

1593
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:09,156
We're reunited
at our high points now.

1594
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:11,332
I can't believe we did it.

1595
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:15,037
Going up from there on out
together to the top.

1596
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:24,508
Come on, Jorgeson.
Come on.

1597
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:27,557
He was sitting on five
days' rest while I caught up.

1598
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:30,761
Pretty sure he's going to
pull me up the wall today.

1599
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:34,974
From here on it's just
a matter of grinding it out.

1600
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:38,060
So we get up and we stay
300 feet from the top.

1601
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:46,238
We wake up this last morning.

1602
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:48,491
The sun comes on the Dawn Wall.

1603
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:52,832
It hits the top
of the Wall first,

1604
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:56,378
and we're the only thing
in Yosemite actually in the sun.

1605
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:57,829
So happy-

1606
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:02,001
This is a good moment
right here.

1607
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:04,211
This is definitely
a good moment.

1608
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:09,883
Does it get any better
than this?

1609
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:12,720
I'm just enjoying
my last day

1610
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:14,771
being up here with my friend.

1611
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:17,315
I think we should just stay.

1612
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:19,817
Just cancel the whole thing.

1613
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:23,442
We're going to camp here
for another day.

1614
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:26,195
Living on a wall
where everything is so simple

1615
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:27,526
for 19 days,

1616
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:29,782
we were going to miss
that experience.

1617
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:31,284
Good morning
to our viewers.

1618
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:33,991
It's been an exciting 24 hours
here in Yosemite.

1619
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:35,826
Tommy Caldwell
and Kevin Jorgeson

1620
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:37,535
spent 19 days on the Wall.

1621
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:40,372
There were 15 TV trucks,
reporters from all over.

1622
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:41,923
There was a webcam.

1623
01:34:42,135 --> 01:34:43,967
Millions of people were actually
watching this live.

1624
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:45,795
Like a moon landing
or something.

1625
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:52,263
A lot of their friends
and family had come out.

1626
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:55,436
A number of people hiked up
El Cap the back way,

1627
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:58,640
and you could watch these guys
go up the final pitches.

1628
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,316
And they're cheering them on.

1629
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,860
I love you! Whoo!

1630
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:05,863
It's gonna be awesome.

1631
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:09,909
Seeing Tommy
do the Dawn Wall,

1632
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:12,078
I was super happy for him.

1633
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:14,657
Just knowing how much
was emotionally wrapped up

1634
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:16,617
in the route for him,

1635
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:21,292
I was really proud of him.

1636
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:24,750
Actually seeing he was
going to complete this climb,

1637
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:27,586
it was just, wow.

1638
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:32,432
After 19 days,

1639
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:35,306
Tommy Caldwell pulling himself
over the edge of the Dawn Wall.

1640
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:43,895
Followed minutes later by
climbing partner Kevin Jorgeson.

1641
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:00,873
And the crowd cheered

1642
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:04,582
as the two men accomplished
a feat many said was impossible.

1643
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:20,435
There aren't a lot
of moments that choke me up

1644
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:23,312
in sports anymore.
I've been doing this too long.

1645
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:26,395
I'll never forget a scene
of them rejoicing.

1646
01:36:32,578 --> 01:36:35,661
This is the moment that's been
so many years in the making.

1647
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:37,659
Now forever enshrined
in history.

1648
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,786
Inspiring millions
around the world,

1649
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:41,118
even at the White House,

1650
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:44,204
where President Obama
gave a thumbs up.

1651
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:48,625
It's done. It's done.

1652
01:36:48,845 --> 01:36:49,926
You are shaking like a leaf.

1653
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:51,549
Are you cold
or are you emotional?

1654
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:53,471
- I'm emotional.
- OK.

1655
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:56,345
He's worked so hard
for this.

1656
01:36:56,561 --> 01:37:00,976
That moment
he describes as bittersweet.

1657
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:06,481
This whole experience
that drove him for so long,

1658
01:37:06,696 --> 01:37:08,152
it was over.

1659
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:13,066
Anything that you'd like to say
about El Cap?

1660
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:16,699
I've totally fallen in love
with that piece of rock.

1661
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:18,951
It's been a big centerpiece
of my life.

1662
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:21,659
And I just feel so thankful
every day.

1663
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:40,852
Tommy and Kevin
join us now on SportsCenter.

1664
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:43,271
I know Tommy's lost his voice
a little bit.

1665
01:37:43,483 --> 01:37:46,225
It drove me
every day for seven years.

1666
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:47,434
Sorry.

1667
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:52,947
What did your first real shower
in 19 days feel like?

1668
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:58,282
I, like the entire world,
was watching you.

1669
01:37:58,498 --> 01:38:00,910
And I just thought, why?

1670
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:06,870
Throwing out today's
first pitch, Kevin Jorgeson.

1671
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:15,012
Tommy Caldwell's
new autobiography, "The Push".

1672
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:18,636
You were captured
by militants in Kyrgyzstan?

1673
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,310
Turns out

1674
01:38:22,522 --> 01:38:25,355
the militant
actually survived the fall.

1675
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,102
The rebel
was put on trial

1676
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:31,733
and found guilty of terrorism,
murder, and kidnapping.
