00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:49,288

00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,790
<i>believed to represent
the 19-year cycle of the moon.</i>

13
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,027
They're coming.

14
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:46,613
They're coming.

15
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:06,675
Anybody home?

16
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:16,727
Hello?

17
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:20,230
Daddy's here.
Yea!

18
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:22,232
Oh, hey.
Oh, Daddy!

19
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:24,234
Daddy's here!

20
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,238
Daddy! Children, we leave
our food at the table.

21
00:09:28,364 --> 00:09:30,908
Oh, I'm sorry, it's bad
timing. I'm used to it.

22
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,910
What'd you bring us?
Well, wait.

23
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:35,913
This, uh... One for you.
One for you.

24
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:43,379
What's the matter?
Don't you like them?

25
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:45,464
Mom already got us masks.

26
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:47,466
Silver Shamrock.
Look!

27
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:50,969
Nice try.

28

* Eight more days to Halloween, halloween, halloween *

29
00:09:55,683 --> 00:09:56,558
So ...

30
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,810
how you've been?

31
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:02,564
I gotta call in.

32
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:06,110
Drinking and doctor. Great combination.

33
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:08,112
Let's watch TV.
Okay.

34
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:19,498
<i>* Eight more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *

<i>* Eight more days to Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *</i>

36
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:25,212
When?

37
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:28,674
What's his condition?

38
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,012
All right, I'll be right in.
I gotta go.

39
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:36,515
His condition is stable,
but Dr. Castle had to leave early.

40
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,309
So I thought I should call
you. Sure, sure. That's fiine.

41
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:45,315
He just walked up
outta the rain.

42
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:48,068
I swear to God
that's all there was to it.

43
00:10:48,193 --> 00:10:50,654
I just brought him here.

44
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,658
Do you have a room for him? Yes, 13.

45
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:02,499
Hey, can I leave now?
Sure. I don't see why not.

46
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:05,044
Thanks a lot for bringing him.
- Well, thank you, Doc.

47
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:08,505
I was always taught that when somebody
needs help, you help 'em.

48
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,343
I mean less there's gonna be trouble.
There's not gonna be any trouble, in it.

49
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:15,721
I mean you never know,
when somebody might be needing help.

50
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:18,515
It might be my turn next time.

51
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:22,853
They're going to kill us.

52
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:26,774
All of us.

53
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,693
All of us.

54
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:31,570
Hundred milligrams,
Thorazine.

55
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:33,405
I.V.

56
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:50,798
Who's next?

57
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,758
Nobody.

58
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,804
Except for him, it's a quiet night.

59
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:58,305
I could use a nap.

60
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,140
Doctor's lounge is empty.

61
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:02,267
Wanna take one with me?

62
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:08,065
Pillows are in the cabinet and
there's milk and cookies in the fridge.

63
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,359
I think I should have
married you, Agnes.

64
00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:15,572
Ooh! Watch it. I play
for keeps, you know. I'm serious.

65
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,267
What are you doing
in here?

66
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:11,290
A man...

67
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:13,208
A man just, just...

68
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:16,003
A man just... He just...

69
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:17,838
All right, all right.

70
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:38,108
Hey!

71
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:23,696
Hello, Linda. Dan.

72
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:28,117
<i>I won't be able to pick the kids up tonight something ...
- Damn it, you promised me.</i>

73
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:30,953
My ex-wife.

74
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,917
No, no, Linda, it's nothing
like that at all.

75
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:39,336
<i>If you'd just relax for a minute,
- I... I am relaxed.</i>

76
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:42,423
Two men died here tonight.

77
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:45,467
No, it wasn't an accident.

78
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:49,346
Listen, I'll tell you
all about it later, all right?

79
00:16:49,471 --> 00:16:51,557
<i>I really gotta go.
- Dan, you promised.</i>

80
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:53,517
Sure. Sure. Saturday
night. That'd be fine.

81
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:55,269
They can both stay with me all night.

82
00:16:55,686 --> 00:16:56,270
<i>Great.</i>

83
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,813
Tell them I'm sorry.

84
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:01,108
<i>10:00 a.m., Saturday. Please.</i>

85
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,944
I really gotta go.

86
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,571
<i>Bye.
- Bye.</i>

87
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,580
<i>If you would like
to make a call,</i>

88
00:17:14,705 --> 00:17:17,166
<i>please hang up
and try again.</i>

89
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:09,760
Is this my father?

90
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:11,512
Ma'am, I wouldn't.

91
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:13,806
Not yet.
- Let's get it over with.

92
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:24,608
Yes, that's my father.

93
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:28,862
What happened?

94
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:30,614
Oh, some crazy man.

95
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:34,410
Killed himself in the parking lot right after.
Drugs probably.

96
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:36,829
Is that it? My father's
dead because of some crazy...

97
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:39,540
The whole thing is under investigation.

98
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,166
I'll bet.

99
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,544
You've had a hard night,
and you've come a long way.

100
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:45,963
When you feel better,
I'll have some questions.

101
00:18:46,088 --> 00:18:48,257
And maybe some more answers.

102
00:19:00,644 --> 00:19:02,896
<i>Dr. Rusfield, call admitting.</i>

103
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:06,025
<i>Dr. Rusfield, call admitting.</i>

104
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:41,894
Look, Challis,
I'm only the assistant.

105
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:45,731
Just tell me what you know, Teddy.
Not much. It's taking a while.

106
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:48,525
The guy was a pile of ashes.
I know the sheriff thinks he was on drugs.

107
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,070
That doesn't make any sense.
I've seen lots of people on drugs and ...

108
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:54,031
The man was in complete control.
He looked like a businessman.

109
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:56,742
He had to be one strong
businessman. I can tell you that.

110
00:19:56,867 --> 00:20:00,996
You don't pull someone's skull apart
without a little lower arm strength. Know, what I mean?

111
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:04,249
Teddy ... just do me this one favor.
Check this one out yourself.

112
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,626
Now, I can't do that.

113
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:07,586
It's gotta go through...
- Please.

114
00:20:08,462 --> 00:20:09,588
This thing's really got you.

115
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:13,384
I've been with that hospital for eight
years. Somebody just doesn't walk in...

116
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:20,099
I'll see what I can do.
No promises.

117
00:20:20,265 --> 00:20:22,142
Thanks. Thanks.

118
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:25,771
I was always good at moonlighting, wasn't I?
- Oh, the best.

119
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:29,441
Do you still have
that... You do? - Uh-huh.

120
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:31,819
How you been?
- Okay. You? - Okay.

121
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:36,323
Sierra Mesa still making you drink your ass off?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

122
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:39,159
Thanks again.

123
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:43,122
Hey, you gonna be all right?

124
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:13,610
Hey, Charlie, can we have another station?

125
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:14,862
You got it.

126

What's the matter?
Don't you have any Halloween spirit?

131
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:36,008
No.

132
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:53,108
Hi.
- Hello.

133
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:54,818
My name is Ellie Grimbridge.

134
00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:55,861
I know.

135
00:21:55,986 --> 00:21:57,529
Dan Challis.
- I know.

136
00:21:57,654 --> 00:22:00,074
One of the nurses told me, I could find you here.

137
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:03,327
I saw you at the funeral.
Thank you.

138
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:06,038
I'm sorry about your father.

139
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,794
Did my father say anything
to you the night he died?

140
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:15,130
Yeah. He, uh ...

141
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,674
Yeah.

142
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:19,635
He said,
"Tell Ellie I love her."

143
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,721
Well ...

144
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:24,765
you're a bad liar, but ...

145
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:27,559
thank you anyway.
- Wait a second.

146
00:22:30,646 --> 00:22:32,564
I saw something that night.

147
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,734
I don't know.
Your father came into the hospital. He ...

148
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:39,947
I thought he was crazy, out of his mind.
He's hangin' on to a Halloween mask. He wouldn't let it go.

149
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:43,409
And what he said was...
"They're gonna kill us all."

150
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:45,661
And in a little while, he was dead.

151
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:48,497
And I don't know
what the hell is goin' on.

152
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:59,508
Papa really loved this place ...

153
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:01,969
But business was getting bad.

154
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:06,056
I suppose you shopped at the new
mall like everybody else, huh?

155
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:09,268
The kids were keeping him going.

156
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:11,020
They'd come in after school.

157
00:23:11,145 --> 00:23:14,565
He'd let 'em play with stuff right in the
aisles like I used to when I was little.

158
00:23:15,315 --> 00:23:18,694
The question is, why would
anybody wanna kill Papa?

159
00:23:18,986 --> 00:23:21,196
He was a wonderful man.
He...

160
00:23:23,657 --> 00:23:25,868
I've been doing some detective work.

161
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:29,580
My father kept excellent records.

162
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:34,376
"October 18: Merchants council
meeting." He was there. I checked.

163
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:37,463
"October 19: Football game."
He was there too.

164
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:40,966
"October 20:
Pick up more masks."

165
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,427
Yeah.

166
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:45,971
That's the kind your father had in his hand.

167
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:48,766
"October 21:
Dinner with Minnie."

168
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:51,060
Minnie Blankenship.
He never showed up.

169
00:23:51,185 --> 00:23:52,269
He never called.

170
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:53,687
You've been busy.

171
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:57,399
I think my father ran into trouble ...
somewhere between here ...

172
00:23:57,524 --> 00:23:59,026
and Santa Mira.

173
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:00,986
Santa Mira?

174
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:02,363
Where they make those.

175
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,948
-Oh.
- Little place. Not too far away.

176
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,077
Maybe they know something.

177
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:12,456
I'm not going back to L.A,
until I find out what happened to my father.

178
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:23,634
Linda, I can't get out of it.
I'm really sorry. I ...

179
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,971
<i>You're gonna sit around...
- No. It's just a bunch of doctors talking about boring stuff.</i>

180
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:30,974
<i>The kids don't even remember your name!
- Linda, Linda take it easy.</i>

181
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,936
I'll be back to take 'em trick or treating. I promise.

182
00:24:34,061 --> 00:24:37,022
<i>I'll call...
- Tell me where you're going to stay.
- No, I can't remember the name of the hotel.</i>

183
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:38,399
I'll call you Monday.

184
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:40,442
<i> I gotta go.
- Wait a minute!
- Bye.</i>

185
00:24:56,709 --> 00:25:00,129
<i>"We'll be back with more" Dance Party
right after these messages.</i>

186
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:13,225
<i>* Two more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
* Two more days to Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *</i>

187
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,186
<i>* Two more days to Halloween, Halloween ... *</i>

188
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:21,817
I think it's the next exit.
- Wait a minute.

189
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:23,360
Yeah, that's it.

190
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:26,947
Then we go about ten miles
and turn right on 33.

191
00:25:27,114 --> 00:25:31,201
I wanna know, why they put their factory
out here in the middle of nowhere.

192
00:25:33,245 --> 00:25:33,996
Listen ...

193
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:38,834
Santa Mira founded in 1887,
farming community.

194
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,878
Grew up around a large dairy.

195
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:46,258
After World War II ... a wealthy Irishman, Conal Cochran
converted it into a toy factory ...

196
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:48,469
Silver Shamrock Novelties.

197
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:52,264
Now given over to the manufacture
and sale of Halloween masks.

198
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:54,141
Largest in the world.

199
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,184
Proud community.

200
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:56,894
Predominantly Irish.

201
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:59,188
Irish Halloween masks?

202
00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:01,648
In California ... you never know.

203
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:37,434
I feel like a goldfish.

204
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,019
Company town.

205
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:13,303
I'm not ready for this.
We need a plan.

206
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:15,055
Ok. How about this?

207
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:17,182
We go back to that gas station ...

208
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:19,518
See if they know anything. We could a ...

209
00:27:19,643 --> 00:27:23,355
pose as a couple of buyers
and maybe rent a couple of rooms in that motel.

210
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:27,860
That way at least we'd have some place to talk without
the whole town watching us.

211
00:27:27,985 --> 00:27:29,361
Good point.

212
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:51,383
Good evening to you.
- Say partner a ...

213
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:55,346
You haven't know is there a vacancy here in this motel?
My wife and I need a place to stay.

214
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:57,556
You've come to the right place.

215
00:27:58,932 --> 00:28:02,895
It's cozy, it's quiet,
and the price is right.

216
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:06,065
Keep him happy
just for a minute.

217
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:16,408
Shower's good.
Put in new pipes last year.

218
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:33,676
Any bags?
- Oh, yeah.

219
00:28:42,476 --> 00:28:44,228
Light packers, aren't ya?

220
00:28:44,353 --> 00:28:46,480
We've had a lot of practice.

221
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:51,443
Ah! There's Mr. Cochran now.

222
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:09,670
A great man, Conal Cochran.
A true genius.

223
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,851
Daddy!

224
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:26,895
Watch your driving, honey.
You could've killed that man.

225
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,859
I didn't hurt him! Hey, sorry
about that. Glad it didn't hit ya.

226
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:34,403
And great big thank you for pickin' it up.
You all right?

227
00:29:34,528 --> 00:29:38,157
No problem.
- Hey, Buddy Kupfer, San Diego.

228
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:40,617
This is my wife Betty.

229
00:29:40,743 --> 00:29:42,411
Please to meet you.

230
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,663
And right there's Little Buddy.

231
00:29:44,955 --> 00:29:47,541
Is it busted?
- No.

232
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:49,960
Don't you dare go in the street!

233
00:29:50,085 --> 00:29:52,129
Do you hear me?!

234
00:29:52,504 --> 00:29:54,673
I gotta go.
- I'll be checkin' you in now, sir.

235
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:00,429
I fiilled out the register. I left $40 under the blotter.
That'd cover it? - Oh, heavens, yes. Thank you, sir.

236
00:30:00,554 --> 00:30:02,306
Have a pleasant stay.

237
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:07,061
Mr. Kupfer, I presume?
Your rooms are waiting.

238
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:09,063
Damn factory!

239
00:30:09,188 --> 00:30:13,650
Got their orders all screwed up.
Now I have to stay in this dump again!

240
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:18,447
Oh, that's great.
Hey honey, it's a freebie!

241
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:27,081
This place is a zoo.

242
00:30:27,247 --> 00:30:29,041
I saw Cochran.
His car, anyway.

243
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,752
And your old man stayed here on the 20th. I was right!

244
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:35,714
We'll go directly to the factory.
- Whoa. Hold on. Slow down, slow down. It's getting late.

245
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,299
I could use a drink.

246
00:30:37,424 --> 00:30:38,884
Let's take our time.

247
00:30:39,385 --> 00:30:40,719
It's okay with you?

248
00:30:40,844 --> 00:30:42,262
To stay, I mean?

249
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:44,682
Yeah, I think these a ...

250
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:48,268
clothes could probably hold out
for at least one more day.

251
00:30:51,146 --> 00:30:52,898
Maybe I ought to get another room.

252
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,693
That would look sort of suspicious, wouldn't it?

253
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,986
What I mean is, if you'd ...

254
00:30:58,112 --> 00:30:59,697
feel more comfortable ...

255
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:01,490
I could sleep in the car.

256
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,575
Be better than this floor, anyway.

257
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:07,705
Where do you wanna sleep, Dr. Challis?

258
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:14,545
That's a dumb question, Miss Grimbridge.

259
00:31:36,358 --> 00:31:39,570
<i>It's six o'clock ... it's six o'clock ...</i>

260
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:40,904
<i>Curfew.</i>

261
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:42,906
<i>Curfew.</i>

262
00:31:43,324 --> 00:31:47,661
<i>All residents of Santa Mira, please clear the streets.</i>

263
00:31:48,287 --> 00:31:51,165
<i>Curfew is now in effect.</i>

264
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:58,756
<i>Please confine your activities to your own homes.</i>

265
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:00,049
<i>Thank you.</i>

266
00:32:01,216 --> 00:32:03,469
<i>Have a very pleasant evening.</i>

267
00:33:14,498 --> 00:33:17,584
Oh, Jesus!
- Mister, I didn't mean to scare you.

268
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,711
Saw that bottle.

269
00:33:18,836 --> 00:33:20,212
Thought it looked pretty heavy.

270
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:23,882
I ain't got no diseases.
You mind if I have a drink?

271
00:33:29,555 --> 00:33:31,306
Goddamn.
Thank you.

272
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:33,726
Hey, just a second. You are ...

273
00:33:33,851 --> 00:33:36,061
You have know anything about this Cochran?

274
00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:38,939
Cochran, Cochran?
Do I know anything?

275
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,401
He made Santa Mira
what it is today.

276
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:45,321
Dried up, little pile of nothing.

277
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:47,239
Let me tell you something, mister.

278
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:51,410
He brought in every damn one of
them factory people from the outside.

279
00:33:51,827 --> 00:33:54,163
You think he'd hire me?
A local boy?

280
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:56,957
No way. Turned me down flat.

281
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:00,711
You haven't got a dollar you can spare, do you?

282
00:34:02,463 --> 00:34:03,339
Thank you.

283
00:34:04,214 --> 00:34:06,008
All I can tell you, mister ...

284
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:07,760
is watch out.

285
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:09,928
You seen the TV cameras yet?

286
00:34:10,512 --> 00:34:13,307
He's watching you, friend.
I guarantee you that.

287
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:15,225
Hey, Cochran ..., fuck you.

288
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:20,189
Fuck you! - Ooh, ooh, shh, easy.
- It's all right all right. It don't matter to me.

289
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:22,566
He's probably listenin'.

290
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:24,068
And if he is ...

291
00:34:24,526 --> 00:34:26,278
I got one thing to say.

292
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:30,908
It's the last Halloween
for that lousy factory of his.

293
00:34:32,076 --> 00:34:35,287
Some pretty wild shit goin' on in there.
I ... I heard rumors.

294
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:37,873
Like what? What'd you hear?
- This year ...

295
00:34:38,374 --> 00:34:39,500
I'm gonna get me ...

296
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,878
about a case and a half of Molotov cocktails.

297
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:46,340
Burn that son of a bitch right down!

298
00:34:46,882 --> 00:34:49,093
Be the last Halloween for them.

299
00:34:50,594 --> 00:34:52,388
Last Halloween.

300
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:47,693
What?

301
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:56,702
Fellas, I was just kidding.
You know that ... You know that. Just kidding!

302
00:36:41,413 --> 00:36:43,248
Oh, sorry.

303
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:45,751
I didn't mean to scare you.

304
00:36:46,085 --> 00:36:47,836
Are you picking up an order?

305
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:51,298
Are you picking up
an order at the factory?

306
00:36:51,548 --> 00:36:56,637
Oh, yeah. - Oh, I figured.
There's no other reason to be in this godforsaken place.

307
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:59,390
All I can say is, good luck to both of us.

308
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:02,643
They may make great masks,
but ever since they started big volume business,

309
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:05,437
the little guy has to stand in line.
You know, what I mean?

310
00:37:05,562 --> 00:37:07,106
I gave up ordering by mail.

311
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:09,608
But I hate trying to deal with 'em in person.

312
00:37:10,025 --> 00:37:11,443
You can't win.

313
00:37:11,568 --> 00:37:14,947
Oh, you know,
I hate to say anything, but ...

314
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:16,490
the merchandise
is slipping.

315
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:19,868
I mean. My four-year-old was throwing
the thing against the wall.

316
00:37:19,994 --> 00:37:21,954
The trademark shouldn't just come right off.

317
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,122
Yeah, I see what you mean.

318
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:23,998
By the way ...

319
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:25,457
My name's Marge Guttman.

320
00:37:25,582 --> 00:37:28,961
My shop's on Union Square in San Francisco.
You can't miss it. - Okay. - Why don't you look me up?

321
00:37:29,086 --> 00:37:31,130
Yes. Thanks, I will.
- Bye.

322
00:38:33,651 --> 00:38:34,860
<i>Hello?
-Teddy.</i>

323
00:38:34,985 --> 00:38:36,070
I tried you at home.

324
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:38,614
<i>Why would I be at home,
when there's something like this cooking?</i>

325
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:40,699
<i>Get it cooking.
- Got anything?</i>

326
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:43,452
No. Someone made
a colossal boo-boo.

327
00:38:43,577 --> 00:38:46,330
We've been doing an autopsy
on part of the car.

328
00:38:46,455 --> 00:38:50,751
C-4 something.
Just plastic and metal shavings.

329
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:54,004
Two days wasted because
somebody mixed up the envelopes.

330
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:55,464
Where are you calling from?

331
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:56,674
Santa Mira.

332
00:38:56,799 --> 00:38:59,843
The Rose of Shannon Motel. I'll
check back with you tomorrow.

333
00:38:59,968 --> 00:39:02,054
All right, Sherlock.Ciao.

334
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:26,388
<i>* Two more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
These commercials ...</i>

335
00:40:26,513 --> 00:40:28,640
<i>* Two more days to Halloween ...
never stops.</i>

336
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:42,029
Wait.

337
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:47,993
Aren't you just ... the least bit tired?

338
00:40:48,118 --> 00:40:49,119
No.

339
00:40:52,122 --> 00:40:54,917
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

340
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:57,086
How old are you?

341
00:40:58,003 --> 00:40:59,129
Relax.

342
00:40:59,463 --> 00:41:01,173
I'm older than I look.

343
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:08,907
What's that?

344
00:42:10,117 --> 00:42:11,702
Who cares?

345
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,291
What the hell was that?

346
00:43:25,651 --> 00:43:26,694
What's going on?

347
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:28,153
I don't know.

348
00:43:34,368 --> 00:43:37,788
Oh, my God. That must be Marge.
- Who's that? - A lady I met.

349
00:43:37,913 --> 00:43:41,291
Excuse me, I'm a doctor. Please.
I said I'm a doctor.

350
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:43,335
Don't trouble yourself, sir.

351
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,005
She'll get the best care money can buy.

352
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,136
Who's in charge of the patient?

353
00:43:52,594 --> 00:43:54,847
Why, Mr. Cochran, of course.

354
00:44:02,021 --> 00:44:06,442
Mr. Cochran, good to see you, sir.
- Good evening, Mr. Rafferty.

355
00:44:06,942 --> 00:44:10,070
It's all over, my friends.
Just a small accident.

356
00:44:10,195 --> 00:44:13,824
The lady's going to get the very best
possible treatment. I promise you that.

357
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:15,242
Where are they taking her?

358
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:17,244
They're taking her to the factory.

359
00:44:17,578 --> 00:44:21,957
We've the most marvelous facility
there for emergency treatment.

360
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:29,173
What happened?
- Misfire.

361
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:35,387
No, don't.

362
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,681
We can't afford to stick out.

363
00:44:39,808 --> 00:44:41,268
Let's just go.

364
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:08,045
Misfiire?

365
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:11,757
What the hell were they talking about?
- Something crazy going on here. - You wanna leave?

366
00:45:11,882 --> 00:45:13,258
Yes, very much.

367
00:45:13,384 --> 00:45:16,804
But not until I find out,
whether my father went to that factory.

368
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:43,163
Hello?

369
00:45:43,288 --> 00:45:44,415
Can you talk?

370
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,334
Sure. I just fiinished sifting the ashes.

371
00:45:47,543 --> 00:45:48,460
What do you have?

372
00:45:48,585 --> 00:45:50,295
<i>It's what I don't have, that bothers me.</i>

373
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:52,464
You know, I'm starting to wonder if some...

374
00:45:53,215 --> 00:45:55,634
someone hasn't been tampering with this stuff.

375
00:45:55,843 --> 00:45:56,510
Why?

376
00:45:56,635 --> 00:46:01,015
Well ... that was a hot fire. But there would have to be
some bone fragments or teeth or something.

377
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,934
I've got nothing here to indicate,
there was ever body at all.

378
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:05,477
Just ashes and car parts.

379
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:06,645
How about you?

380
00:46:07,062 --> 00:46:11,400
Listen Teddy. Do me another favor.
Will you find out everything you can about Conal Cochran?

381
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:14,611
<i>He runs Silver Shamrock,
the Halloween mask people.</i>

382
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:17,614
Conal Cochran.

383
00:46:19,867 --> 00:46:23,829
All right, but this is gonna cost you
some serious dinners when you get back.

384
00:46:23,954 --> 00:46:25,831
I'm always ready for dinner with you.

385
00:46:25,956 --> 00:46:27,624
Liar. Bye.

386
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:30,002
Bye.

387
00:47:13,796 --> 00:47:15,923
Oh, there must be some mistake, dearie.

388
00:47:16,048 --> 00:47:21,637
Mr. Grimbridge himself picked up that order on the 21 st.
Here's his signature.

389
00:47:23,305 --> 00:47:24,264
Thank you.

390
00:47:25,391 --> 00:47:27,309
Do you remember that transaction?

391
00:47:27,434 --> 00:47:30,771
No ... but you can talk
to someone who might.

392
00:47:33,691 --> 00:47:34,900
Oh, Red ...

393
00:47:35,025 --> 00:47:36,944
these people lost an order.

394
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:38,946
Did you load this one?

395
00:47:39,655 --> 00:47:42,616
Sure did. Last week. A man
in an old green station wagon.

396
00:47:42,741 --> 00:47:44,576
That's right. Did he say
where he was going?

397
00:47:44,702 --> 00:47:47,746
No, ma'am. Headed out to
the north. I remember that.

398
00:47:49,707 --> 00:47:50,833
Thank you.

399
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,546
Would you care to make another order, madam?
- No. Let's go.

400
00:47:59,299 --> 00:48:02,845
Well, hey.
How ya doin'?

401
00:48:03,178 --> 00:48:04,680
Buddy Kupfer and family ...

402
00:48:04,805 --> 00:48:08,308
here to see Mr. Cochran.
- Yes, Mr. Kupfer. Welcome.

403
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:10,728
I'll tell Mr. Cochran, you're here.

404
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:17,943
When do we get to see 'em
makin' the masks?

405
00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:22,781
Real soon, little buddy. - Buddy, my feet are killing me.
- Honey, come on. The fun's just startin'.

406
00:48:22,906 --> 00:48:25,451
I've seen enough. Let's get out of here.
- All right, all right.

407
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:26,493
Oh wait!

408
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,453
Wait.

409
00:48:27,995 --> 00:48:28,829
Well,

410
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:33,542
so this is Buddy Kupfer
and his lovely family.

411
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:35,210
My friends ...

412
00:48:35,336 --> 00:48:40,966
Mr. Kupfer has sold more Silver Shamrock masks
this year, by far, than anyone else in the country.

413
00:48:48,098 --> 00:48:52,102
And as for my other friends,
Mr. And Mrs...

414
00:48:52,353 --> 00:48:55,439
Smith.
- Smith, of course.

415
00:48:55,564 --> 00:49:02,071
My apologies for that little bit of a disturbance last night,
but I want you both to know,
that Mrs. Guttman is going to be fine.

416
00:49:02,196 --> 00:49:05,157
She's been flown to a hospital in San Francisco.

417
00:49:05,658 --> 00:49:06,116
Thank you.

418
00:49:06,241 --> 00:49:07,326
For and a ...

419
00:49:07,493 --> 00:49:09,578
About the confusion over your order.

420
00:49:09,703 --> 00:49:10,954
I'll just tell you one thing...

421
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,250
A replacement order is being prepared
for you absolutely free ...

422
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:17,336
The whole thing's on me.

423
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,466
Is he incredible or what?

424
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:24,385
Now. How would you like a guided tour?

425
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:25,969
Oh, thank you, sir.

426
00:49:26,095 --> 00:49:28,472
Would it be all right if my friends come along?

427
00:49:28,597 --> 00:49:32,434
Oh ... yes, I was just about to ask them.
If you'd like to?

428
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:35,187
We'd love to.

429
00:49:35,312 --> 00:49:36,355
Come along.

430
00:49:36,522 --> 00:49:37,439
Come along.

431
00:50:02,631 --> 00:50:06,844
The latex is heated and poured.
After that, it's cooled and poured off.

432
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:11,432
Then it's all just a matter of trimming,
painting and packaging.

433
00:50:43,005 --> 00:50:46,842
Oh, wow, this is it.
Hall of fame time.

434
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:49,053
What's famous?
You really don't know?

435
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:52,639
Conal Cochran, the all-time
genius of the practical joke.

436
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:55,100
He invented sticky toilet paper.

437
00:50:55,851 --> 00:51:00,773
Oh, you must know. The dead
dwarf gag, the soft chain saw. All his.

438
00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:03,692
No, gee, I didn't know that.
- And before that, he used to make toys.

439
00:51:03,817 --> 00:51:08,155
Remember that? I had one of those when
I was a kid. Used to sit and watch it for hours.

440
00:51:08,864 --> 00:51:11,992
The man has always paid attention to detail.

441
00:51:12,993 --> 00:51:15,537
Are we all together?
- Yeah.

442
00:51:18,499 --> 00:51:21,960
Oh, I want a mask.
Can I have a mask?

443
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:25,339
Just what I had in mind for you, Little Buddy.
- I want that one.

444
00:51:25,464 --> 00:51:27,007
Oh, no, no, no, no.

445
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,134
Look over here.

446
00:51:29,259 --> 00:51:32,054
Those masks haven't been through final processing.

447
00:51:34,181 --> 00:51:35,474
This one has.

448
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:42,064
There you are.

449
00:51:42,481 --> 00:51:44,358
That's wonderful.

450
00:51:46,443 --> 00:51:49,780
What final process?
- Don't ask me.

451
00:52:02,543 --> 00:52:05,087
Hey, Mr. Cochran,
just what is the final process?

452
00:52:05,212 --> 00:52:08,298
I asure you it's just a little bit of this
and a little bit of that.

453
00:52:08,716 --> 00:52:12,386
Quality inspection, the seal of approval.
You know, the usual.

454
00:52:13,262 --> 00:52:14,471
And of course ...

455
00:52:14,596 --> 00:52:16,015
there's a couple of ...

456
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:17,683
trade secrets.

457
00:52:17,808 --> 00:52:20,477
I'd sure love to take a look.

458
00:52:20,602 --> 00:52:22,855
Oh, sorry.

459
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,442
Not even a peek for your best
salesman? Oh, just one little look.

460
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:27,693
Well you see ...

461
00:52:27,818 --> 00:52:30,112
Part of the inspection process involves ...

462
00:52:30,237 --> 00:52:36,702
volatile chemicals, very dangerous. I wouldn't want to put
anybody in any danger. - Oh sure, I understand.

463
00:52:36,827 --> 00:52:40,414
Now listen ... I hope you and your family will be able
to have breakfast with me tomorrow morning.

464
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:43,876
I'd like your opinion on some of our sales material.
- My opinion?

465
00:52:44,001 --> 00:52:45,127
Oh, sure.

466
00:52:45,252 --> 00:52:47,838
Do you know he's one of the
richest men in the country?

467
00:52:47,963 --> 00:52:51,633
And he got that way selling
cheap gags and Halloween masks.

468
00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:53,761
Oh god, there's hope for us yet.

469
00:52:53,886 --> 00:53:00,225
It's very valuable to me, you know. Your opinion has
always meant a great deal to us. - Oh, thank you, sir.

470
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:02,978
Where's Little Buddy?
- Oh, there he is, running down there.

471
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,229
See him there?
- Oh, yes.

472
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:09,443
Into everything always.
We like to know everything there is to know.

473
00:53:09,777 --> 00:53:13,113
Like father, like son.
- Oh, yeah.

474
00:53:16,992 --> 00:53:18,118
Excuse me.

475
00:53:18,243 --> 00:53:19,119
Darling?

476
00:53:19,244 --> 00:53:21,455
I think it's time we were going.

477
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:25,417
See you later.

478
00:53:27,461 --> 00:53:28,295
What's up?

479
00:53:29,254 --> 00:53:33,300
I just saw a couple of men
who looked strangely familiar.

480
00:53:34,593 --> 00:53:36,053
And there's another one.

481
00:53:36,178 --> 00:53:39,390
They look a lot like the man,
who killed your father.

482
00:53:47,272 --> 00:53:49,525
Oh, my God!
- What?

483
00:53:49,817 --> 00:53:51,610
That's Papa's car.

484
00:53:51,986 --> 00:53:54,571
Wait, Ellie, Ellie. Don't.

485
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,543
Trade secrets.

486
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,313
I saw it.
I know I saw it.

487
00:54:27,479 --> 00:54:29,148
I think it's time
for the marines.

488
00:54:29,273 --> 00:54:31,233
I'm scared. I think we should leave.

489
00:54:32,151 --> 00:54:32,985
All right.

490
00:54:34,486 --> 00:54:35,821
You pack ...

491
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:39,533
I'll call the police.
This place has to fall under somebody's jurisdiction.

492
00:54:39,658 --> 00:54:42,703
Let's go soon, okay?
- All right, all right.

493
00:55:01,305 --> 00:55:02,306
Hallo.

494
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:14,943
<i>Operator, this is an emergency. I wanna ...
I'm sorry.</i>

495
00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:17,446
<i>We cannot complete your call as dialed.</i>

496
00:55:17,571 --> 00:55:19,281
<i>Please hang up and t...</i>

497
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:27,456
<i>* One more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
* One more days to Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *</i>

498
00:55:27,581 --> 00:55:30,668
<i>* One more days to Halloween ... *
- Yes ... information.</i>

499
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:33,504
<i>I'm sorry. We cannot complete your call as dialed.</i>

500
00:55:33,629 --> 00:55:36,674
<i>Please hang up and check the number and dial again.
* Just one more day ... *</i>

501
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:42,054
<i>Only 24 hours, but that's plenty of time
to pick out one more day halloween ...</i>

502
00:56:03,575 --> 00:56:04,493
Ellie?

503
00:56:06,787 --> 00:56:07,746
Ellie?

504
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,658
<i>Operator.
If you'd like to make a call,</i>

505
00:57:25,783 --> 00:57:28,410
<i>Operator!
Please hang up and try again.</i>

506
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:37,544
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

507
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:41,340
<i>If you need help, you have to
dial your operator for assistance.</i>

508
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:24,545
Where's the girl?

509
01:00:26,463 --> 01:00:27,381
Where is she?

510
01:00:28,465 --> 01:00:31,760
Where is she?
Where is she?!

511
01:00:57,745 --> 01:01:00,831
Oh, Jesus. Je...

512
01:01:54,218 --> 01:01:55,302
Clumsy.

513
01:01:59,973 --> 01:02:01,725
This was a rare piece.

514
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:03,102
German.

515
01:02:03,602 --> 01:02:05,312
Made in Munich ...

516
01:02:05,604 --> 01:02:07,606
1785.

517
01:02:08,107 --> 01:02:10,150
I must try to get a replacement.

518
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:16,699
Ah, Mr. Challis.
- Where is Ellie?

519
01:02:16,991 --> 01:02:18,659
Mrs. Smith.

520
01:02:19,118 --> 01:02:22,204
Ah, sure I believe she's resting just now.

521
01:02:24,748 --> 01:02:26,917
Didn't take you long to get here, Mr. Challis.

522
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:29,294
Dr. Challis, I should say.

523
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,634
It'll be morning soon.

524
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:41,932
Halloween morning.

525
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:44,518
It'll be a very busy day for me.

526
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:49,648
Being a medical man,
you should find it quite interesting.

527
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:57,549
The surprising thing is that the internal
components were quite simple to produce, really.

528
01:03:57,675 --> 01:03:59,009
The outer features ...

529
01:03:59,134 --> 01:04:03,931
took much longer to perfect. But then, of course
in the end it's just another form of mask making.

530
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:08,060
Bless you.

531
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,728
Convincing, aren't they?

532
01:04:10,187 --> 01:04:13,732
Loyal and obedient,
unlike most human beings.

533
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:29,331
Those who went before me, you know they...

534
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:31,917
they never dreamed of anything like this.

535
01:04:32,459 --> 01:04:35,087
What is this place?
- Oh, can't you tell?

536
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,297
Advanced and...

537
01:04:38,173 --> 01:04:40,175
ancient technology.

538
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,347
A good magician never explains.

539
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:46,724
Come on, then.

540
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:50,894
You've still got time
to figure it out all by yourself.

541
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:25,179
From an ancient sacrificial circle.

542
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,222
Stonehenge.

543
01:05:30,142 --> 01:05:33,020
We had a time getting it here.

544
01:05:33,854 --> 01:05:36,482
You wouldn't believe, how we did it.

545
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:50,120
It has a power in it.

546
01:05:51,622 --> 01:05:52,623
A force.

547
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:55,709
Even a...

548
01:05:57,378 --> 01:05:58,629
particle.

549
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:07,888
Devastating.

550
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,951
Oh, Doctor, you asked about the girl.

551
01:06:37,251 --> 01:06:38,293
Where is she?

552
01:06:39,461 --> 01:06:41,296
Right in there.

553
01:06:43,757 --> 01:06:45,384
And your friend, Miss Guttman.

554
01:06:45,509 --> 01:06:49,680
You killed her.
- Oh, no. Miss Guttman was the victim of a misfire.

555
01:06:50,222 --> 01:06:51,473
The others...

556
01:06:52,474 --> 01:06:56,854
What you really need to see is a demonstration
and there's one coming right up.

557
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:42,650
<i>Mr. Cochran will be right along.</i>

558
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:46,111
<i>I don't like this place.Iit gives me the creeps.</i>

559
01:07:46,737 --> 01:07:49,365
<i>I have to go to the bathroom.</i>

560
01:07:50,574 --> 01:07:53,202
Mommy!
- Relax a minute, will you?

561
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,996
Mr. Cochran'll be here.
Then everything will be fine.

562
01:07:56,121 --> 01:07:59,958
He just wants my opinion about some
television commercials or something.

563
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:03,712
You know, I still can't figure out why
they won't take my orders for next year.

564
01:08:03,837 --> 01:08:07,257
<i>You know how I like to work ahead,
and well, they're just not interested at all.</i>

565
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:10,302
Maybe they're not going to
have Halloween next year.

566
01:08:13,305 --> 01:08:14,974
All right, roll it.

567
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:32,658
<i>It's time, it's time.</i>

568
01:08:32,783 --> 01:08:35,160
<i>Time for the big giveaway.
- This is just the same old stuff.</i>

569
01:08:36,704 --> 01:08:41,208
<i>All you lucky kids with Silver Shamrock masks,
gather 'round your TV set.</i>

570
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:46,672
<i>Put on your masks and watch.
- Honey, don't get too close, you'll ruin your eyes.</i>

571
01:08:47,464 --> 01:08:52,469
Gather 'round and watch.
Watch the magic pumpkin. Watch.

572
01:08:59,226 --> 01:09:01,020
I think this whole thing ...

573
01:09:01,145 --> 01:09:02,396
is a big joke.

574
01:09:02,521 --> 01:09:04,523
I mean, look at that.

575
01:09:11,864 --> 01:09:13,741
I mean, look.

576
01:09:15,743 --> 01:09:16,535
Betty.

577
01:09:25,669 --> 01:09:26,712
Honey?

578
01:11:14,528 --> 01:11:21,869
<i>* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *</i>

579
01:11:21,994 --> 01:11:29,960
<i>* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *</i>

580
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:33,505
<i>It's almost time, kids.
The clock is ticking.</i>

581
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:36,258
<i>Be in front of your TVsets
for the "Horrorathon."</i>

582
01:11:36,383 --> 01:11:38,927
<i>And during the big giveaway at nine.</i>

583
01:11:39,053 --> 01:11:40,095
<i>Don't miss it.</i>

584
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:44,350
<i>And don't forget to wear your masks.
The clock is ticking. It's almost time.</i>

585
01:11:44,475 --> 01:11:52,107
<i>* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *</i>

586
01:11:52,232 --> 01:11:59,948
<i>* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *</i>

587
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:05,412
<i>Hurry home. It's almost time.</i>

588
01:12:05,537 --> 01:12:10,751
<i>All those lucky kids with Silver Shamrock masks,
hurry home for the big giveaway.</i>

589
01:12:10,876 --> 01:12:14,088
<i>It's almost time. Hurry home.</i>

590
01:12:45,953 --> 01:12:50,040
<i>What city, please?
The number for Santa Mira,
the Rose of Shannon Motel, please.</i>

591
01:12:50,207 --> 01:12:54,211
<i>555-2462.
Thank you.</i>

592
01:13:13,731 --> 01:13:20,529
<i>I'm sorry. We cannot complete your call as dialed.
Please hang up and dial again. This is a record ...</i>

593
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:30,831
<i>Hello?
Roger?</i>

594
01:13:30,956 --> 01:13:33,292
Did I wake you?
Oh, sorry.

595
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:36,170
Listen. I've got something down here
I'd like for you to look at.

596
01:13:36,295 --> 01:13:36,837
<i>What?</i>

597
01:13:36,962 --> 01:13:40,424
I know I could be wrong,
but I don't think it's a car part at all.

598
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:43,010
<i>Maybe you've seen something like it.
How's tomorrow afternoon?</i>

599
01:13:43,135 --> 01:13:45,721
Tomorrow afternoon?
Okay, great. Thanks, Roger.

600
01:13:45,846 --> 01:13:46,597
Bye.

601
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,565
Oh, my God.

602
01:14:43,028 --> 01:14:45,572
<i>May I help you?
Operator, can you get me the sheriff...</i>

603
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:37,166
Enjoy the "Horrorathon," Doctor.

604
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:40,544
And don't forget to watch
the big giveaway afterwards.

605
01:15:42,588 --> 01:15:44,465
Why, Cochran? Why?

606
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:46,216
Do I need a reason?

607
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:49,345
Mr. Kupfer was right, you know.

608
01:15:49,637 --> 01:15:55,351
I do love a good joke. And this is the best ever.
A joke on the children.

609
01:15:56,769 --> 01:15:58,729
But there's a better reason.

610
01:15:59,229 --> 01:16:02,691
You don't really know much
about Halloween.

611
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:10,366
You thought no further than the strange custom of
having your children wear masks and go out
begging for candy.

612
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:19,249
It was the start of the year in our old Celtic lands
and we'd be waiting ...

613
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,961
in our houses of wattles and clay.

614
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:25,506
The barriers would be down, you see,

615
01:16:25,839 --> 01:16:28,217
Between the real and the unreal.

616
01:16:28,967 --> 01:16:31,011
And the dead might be looking in ...

617
01:16:31,303 --> 01:16:33,931
to sit by our fires of turf.

618
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:38,644
Halloween.

619
01:16:41,105 --> 01:16:43,190
The festival of Samhain.

620
01:16:43,315 --> 01:16:48,654
The last great one took place 3,000 years ago
and the hills ran red ...

621
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:51,782
with the blood of animals and children.

622
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,618
Sacrifices.

623
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,453
It was a part of our world ...

624
01:16:56,954 --> 01:16:58,455
Our craft.

625
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:03,252
Witchcraft.
- To us, it was a way of controlling our environment.

626
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:05,379
It's not so different now.

627
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,840
It's time again.

628
01:17:09,174 --> 01:17:10,676
In the end ...

629
01:17:10,801 --> 01:17:13,262
We don't decide these things, you know.

630
01:17:14,638 --> 01:17:16,473
The planets do.

631
01:17:20,644 --> 01:17:22,479
They're in alignment.

632
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:24,982
And it's time again.

633
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:27,818
The world's going to change tonight, Doctor.

634
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,030
I'm glad you'll be able to watch it.

635
01:17:39,747 --> 01:17:40,664
And...

636
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,461
happy Halloween.

637
01:19:18,262 --> 01:19:20,973
<i>Cochran.
- It's just that work ...</i>

638
01:19:21,515 --> 01:19:23,559
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

639
01:19:49,209 --> 01:19:53,339
Tonight's just for fun. A way of saying
"thank you" to all our good customers.

640
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:54,673
Mr. Cochran.

641
01:19:54,798 --> 01:19:57,676
<i>I have good news for you.
It'll long just a moment.</i>

642
01:20:07,478 --> 01:20:10,773
It's always a pleasure doing
business with you. It is indeed.

643
01:20:21,575 --> 01:20:24,370
A 43 share.
You think so?

644
01:20:43,347 --> 01:20:46,100
Good. And I hope the little ones
will be watching.

645
01:20:46,266 --> 01:20:49,728
Don't forget to tell them to watch
the big giveaway at 9:00.

646
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:11,458
<i>Thank you for calling. Good-bye.
Thanks. Bye.</i>

647
01:21:12,793 --> 01:21:13,544
Sir?

648
01:21:13,836 --> 01:21:14,962
Malfunction.

649
01:21:15,087 --> 01:21:16,213
Camera two.

650
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,886
<i>Hello?
Linda, Linda...</i>

651
01:22:46,011 --> 01:22:51,183
<i>Where the hell have you been? I waited all night.
Shut up, shut up. Linda, shut up. Listen, listen.</i>

652
01:22:51,392 --> 01:22:54,436
You have to get rid of the masks ...
the Silver Shamrock ...

653
01:22:54,561 --> 01:22:55,729
<i>No, no.
The ones that I gave them? You want me to what?</i>

654
01:22:55,854 --> 01:22:59,650
In the Santa Mira.
They killed Buddy Kupfer and his whole family.

655
01:22:59,775 --> 01:23:02,194
<i> They killed him.
That's not enough ...</i>

656
01:23:03,696 --> 01:23:04,655
We've lost him.

657
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,699
No, we haven't.
You'll see.

658
01:23:09,702 --> 01:23:11,328
No, no, no, I'm not drunk.

659
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:14,164
Linda, listen. You have to get rid of the masks.

660
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:15,833
<i>Just ...
You want me to what?</i>

661
01:23:16,834 --> 01:23:20,421
<i>You're just jealous because...
I'm not. Linda, listen.</i>

662
01:23:20,546 --> 01:23:21,922
<i>Go to hell!</i>

663
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:51,952
Ellie. Ellie. Ellie!

664
01:23:56,248 --> 01:23:57,666
South corridor.

665
01:24:07,968 --> 01:24:08,969
Come on.

666
01:26:01,248 --> 01:26:02,166
Wait here.

667
01:26:56,595 --> 01:26:58,430
<i>It's time, it's time.</i>

668
01:26:58,555 --> 01:27:00,557
<i>Time for the big giveaway.</i>

669
01:27:00,683 --> 01:27:02,434
<i>Halloween has come.</i>

670
01:27:02,559 --> 01:27:06,855
<i>All you lucky kids with Silver Shamrock masks,
gather 'round your TVset.</i>

671
01:27:06,981 --> 01:27:09,566
<i>Put on your masks and watch.</i>

672
01:27:09,692 --> 01:27:14,905
<i>All witches, all skeletons, all jack-o'- lanterns
gather 'round and watch.</i>

673
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:16,907
<i>Watch the magic pumpkin.</i>

674
01:27:17,032 --> 01:27:18,742
<i>Watch ...</i>

675
01:29:36,088 --> 01:29:40,801
<i>...in the eastern valley we're expecting overcast sky
and 50% chance of rain thru monday.</i>

676
01:29:40,926 --> 01:29:42,928
<i>It's presently 74 degrees at ...</i>

677
01:29:43,053 --> 01:29:44,930
<i>8:48 p.m.</i>

678
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:48,767
<i>The clock is ticking.
Hurry home, kids.</i>

679
01:29:48,892 --> 01:29:50,561
<i>And happy Halloween.</i>

680
01:29:52,021 --> 01:29:54,815
We've gotta do something,
call somebody. Huh?

681
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:01,655
Ellie, you all right?

682
01:30:05,909 --> 01:30:06,827
Ellie!

683
01:33:23,232 --> 01:33:26,652
Your phone, your phone, where
is it? It's life and death.

684
01:33:29,113 --> 01:33:30,823
Hey, don't I know you?

685
01:33:33,158 --> 01:33:42,668
<i>* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween ... *
- If it goes out it means a death of millions of people
everyone watching. Don't you understand that?</i>

686
01:33:43,168 --> 01:33:44,044
"If"...

687
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:50,301
Well, say it's a bomb. Say whatever you want.
Say whatever you like. Just get if off the air.

688
01:33:50,634 --> 01:33:52,052
Please! Just ...

689
01:33:53,971 --> 01:33:58,058
No, no! I can't prove it!
You've gotta believe me! Believe me!

690
01:33:58,183 --> 01:34:00,436
Take it off the air now! Please!

691
01:34:00,561 --> 01:34:02,479
You've got to, please.

692
01:34:05,357 --> 01:34:08,444
<i>Please excuse the interruption.
We're having technical problems.</i>

693
01:34:08,694 --> 01:34:10,237
<i>Please stand by.</i>

694
01:34:11,905 --> 01:34:14,283
<i>It's time. It's time.</i>

695
01:34:14,408 --> 01:34:18,662
<i>We are experiencing technical difficulties.
Please, stand by.</i>

696
01:34:21,081 --> 01:34:25,419
<i>Gather 'round your TV set.
Put on your masks and watch.</i>

697
01:34:25,544 --> 01:34:28,589
<i>All witches, all skeletons, all jack-o'- lanterns ...</i>

698
01:34:28,714 --> 01:34:31,050
<i>The third commercial,
it's still on. Please.</i>

699
01:34:31,175 --> 01:34:34,094
Take out the third channel.
The third channel it's still running. Stop it, please.

700
01:34:34,219 --> 01:34:36,722
For God's sake, please stop it.
There's no more time.

701
01:34:36,847 --> 01:34:39,933
You've gotta... Please, stop it.
Stop it now. Turn it off!

702
01:34:40,059 --> 01:34:41,143
Turn it off!

703
01:34:41,268 --> 01:34:42,186
Stop it!

704
01:34:42,311 --> 01:34:43,187
Stop it!

705
01:34:43,312 --> 01:34:51,362
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

706
