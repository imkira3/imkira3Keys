<i>Once upon a time,
in deep winter,</i>

3
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,777
<i>a queen was admiring
the falling snow</i>

4
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,406
<i>when she saw a rose blooming
in defiance of the cold.</i>

5
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,201
<i>Reaching for it,
she pricked her finger</i>

6
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,996
<i>and three drops of blood fell.</i>

7
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,253
<i>And because the red seemed
so alive against the white</i>

8
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,923
<i>she thought, "If only I had
a child as white as snow,</i>

9
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:35,428
<i>"lips as red as blood, hair
as black as a raven's wings</i>

10
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,056
<i>"and all with the
strength of that rose."</i>

11
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,772
<i>Soon after, a daughter
was born to the Queen</i>

12
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,400
<i>and was named,
"Snow White."</i>

13
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,405
<i>And she was adored
throughout the kingdom</i>

14
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,951
<i>as much for her defiant
spirit as for her beauty.</i>

15
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,943
We found it
in the woods.

16
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,920
It's injured, Mother.

17
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,405
It must have
broken its wing.

18
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,243
Don't worry,
it will heal in time.

19
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,577
I'll look after it.

20
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,413
You possess a rare beauty, my love.

21
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,416
In here.

22
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,502
Never lose it.

23
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,255
It will serve you well
when you become queen.

24
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,307
Be careful
you don't fall.

25
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,767
I'm just
getting you an apple.

26
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,853
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

27
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,940
William!

28
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,573
<i>The next winter was
the harshest in memory</i>

29
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,993
<i>and Snow White's mother
passed away.</i>

30
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,788
<i>The King was inconsolable.</i>

31
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,999
<i>Taking advantage
of his grief,</i>

32
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,418
<i>a dark and mysterious
army appeared</i>

33
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,253
<i>and lured him into battle.</i>

34
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,823
What devil
spawned this army?

35
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,408
Send them back to hell!

36
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,910
No prisoners!

37
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,392
<i>The dark army
was defeated,</i>

38
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,937
<i>but what would soon come
to pass was far darker.</i>

39
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,105
Sire!

40
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,654
A prisoner.

41
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,242
Fear not,

42
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,577
you will come to no harm
from me or my men.

43
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,289
What is your name,
my lady?

44
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,128
Ravenna, sire.

45
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,551
<i>So enchanted by her beauty was the King</i>

46
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,346
<i>that he forgot, for the
first time, his broken heart</i>

47
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,892
<i>and the very next day,
she would become his wife.</i>

48
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,271
You're so beautiful.

49
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,606
That's kind, child.

50
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,277
Especially when
it is said that yours

51
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,571
is the face of true beauty
in this kingdom.

52
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,322
Come.

53
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,411
This all must be
difficult for you.

54
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:15,082
I, too, lost my mother
when I was a young girl.

55
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,461
I can never take
your mother's place.

56
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:19,879
Never.

57
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,923
But I feel that
you and I are bound.

58
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,428
I feel it there.

59
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,264
Your heart.

60
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,149
You will be
the ruin of me.

61
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,902
Indeed, my lord.

62
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,743
I was ruined
by a king like you once.

63
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,958
I replaced his queen,

64
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,877
an old woman.

65
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,883
And, in time, I, too,
would have been replaced.

66
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,054
Men use women.

67
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:58,811
They ruin us and when
they are finished with us

68
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:04,066
they toss us to the dogs
like scraps.

69
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,069
What have you given me?

70
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,739
When a woman stays young
and beautiful forever,

71
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,533
the world is hers.

72
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:20,040
First, I will take
your life, my lord.

73
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,963
And then
I'll take your throne.

74
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,791
Welcome, brother.

75
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,127
My queen.

76
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,633
<i>She had tricked her way into
the kingdom with a phantom army.</i>

77
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,470
<i>She now welcomed
a very real one.</i>

78
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,883
William!

79
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,593
Snow, get out! Snow!

80
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,845
I can't leave!

81
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,349
- The Princess!
- No!

82
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,268
Get out of here! Go!

83
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,447
William! Don't leave me!

84
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,866
Father, we must go back!
We must!

85
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,868
- No!
- We've lost her!

86
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,204
No! No! No!

87
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,792
Don't leave me!
William!

88
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,399
Out.

89
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,445
Out!

90
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,962
Mirror, mirror

91
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,840
on the wall,

92
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,473
who is
the fairest of them all?

93
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,972
It is you, my queen.

94
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,851
Yet another kingdom
falls to your glory.

95
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,482
Is there no end to
your power and beauty?

96
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,123
The remnants, my queen.
What do we do with them?

97
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,003
To the sword.

98
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,841
Finn.

99
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,513
Lock her up.

100
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:31,393
One never knows when royal
blood may be of value.

101
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,037
<i>So poisonous was
the reign of Ravenna,</i>

102
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:53,999
<i>that nature turned on itself
and people turned on each other.</i>

103
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,918
<i>The land died</i>

104
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,421
<i>and with it, hope.</i>

105
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,426
<i>And all that time, she
kept Snow White imprisoned</i>

106
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,137
<i>high up
in the north tower.</i>

107
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,577
Our Father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

108
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,747
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
done on Earth as it is in heaven.

109
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,208
Give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our sins,

110
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,544
as we forgive those
who sin against us.

111
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,587
Lead us not into temptation,

112
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,465
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

113
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:52,075
Hello?

114
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,792
- What is your name?
- I am Greta.

115
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
What happened to you?

116
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,920
All the girls in our
village were taken.

117
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,798
I was trying to reach Duke
Hammond's castle when I was caught.

118
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,633
Duke Hammond?

119
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,302
Is he alive?

120
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,513
Does he still fight
in my father's name?

121
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,182
You're the King's daughter.

122
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,436
The night the King died, we were
told all in the castle were slain.

123
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
And William?

124
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,648
Is the Duke's son
still alive?

125
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,193
I don't know, Princess.

126
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,987
What will they do to me?

127
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,105
Do you remember
when we were children

128
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,526
begging for scraps
like those wretches?

129
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,611
Yes, sister.

130
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,947
Am I not kinder?

131
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,700
Yes.

132
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,749
These two were captured
leading an ambush

133
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,751
on one of our
supply trains.

134
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,137
Your son?

135
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,848
Handsome.

136
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,895
Obviously, a debt
owed to your mother.

137
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,567
There was a time I would have
lost my heart to a face like yours.

138
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,489
And you, no doubt,
would have broken it.

139
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,365
Lain, no!

140
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,012
You would kill your queen?

141
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,516
Such courage.

142
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,267
Such beauty.

143
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,480
But how strong
is your heart?

144
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,906
No. My son.

145
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,289
My son!

146
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,963
Leave him.

147
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,175
Let him return
to the Duke

148
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,221
and speak of the generosity
of his queen.

149
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:42,931
Out.

150
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,432
Out!

151
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,309
Magic comes
at a lofty price.

152
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,728
And the expense grows.

153
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,730
- You look...
- Old.

154
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,523
Tired.

155
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,487
My power

156
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,907
fades.

157
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,749
I have something
for what ails you.

158
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,177
Oh.

159
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,940
Greta?

160
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,652
Greta?

161
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,825
Mirror, mirror

162
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,618
on the wall,

163
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,289
who is fairest
of them all?

164
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,291
My queen,

165
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,546
on this day,
one has come of age

166
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,757
fairer even than you.

167
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,386
She is the reason
your powers wane.

168
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,054
Who is it?

169
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,974
Snow White.

170
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,518
Snow White?

171
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,688
She is my undoing?

172
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,609
I should have killed her
when she was a child.

173
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,278
Be warned.

174
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:48,408
Her innocence and purity
is all that can destroy you.

175
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,329
But she is also
your salvation, Queen.

176
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,624
Take her heart
in your hand

177
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,295
and you shall never again
need to consume youth.

178
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:04,382
You shall never again
weaken or age.

179
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,718
Immortality.

180
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,054
Immortality

181
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,056
forever.

182
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,810
Finn!

183
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,397
Brother,

184
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,649
bring me
the King's daughter.

185
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,638
Did I wake you?

186
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,652
Are you always awake
when I watch you?

187
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,117
You've never
come in before.

188
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,119
My sister won't allow it.

189
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,374
She wants you
all to herself.

190
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,334
I'm afraid of her.

191
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,338
And not of me?

192
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,507
No.

193
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,303
Fear not, Princess.

194
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:20,184
You will never again
be locked in this cell.

195
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,812
What does she
want from me?

196
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,191
Your beating heart.

197
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,586
Get me out of here!

198
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,588
No!

199
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,173
Greta?

200
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,719
- Go.
- Get me out of here!

201
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,679
- No!
- Go.

202
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:57,889
No!

203
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:29,462
Stop her!

204
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,592
Catch her!

205
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,310
Seize her!

206
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,456
Get to the gate!

207
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,487
Bring her back to me!

208
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,046
How is it that
an innocent young girl

209
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,132
makes a fool
of my brother?

210
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,220
Armed only with a nail.

211
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,808
If she'd had a sword,

212
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,227
she would have
taken my kingdom.

213
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:04,148
"Bring me
the King's daughter,"

214
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:10,905
and you let her slip right
through your tiny little fingers.

215
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,823
How?

216
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,827
You swore that
you would protect me!

217
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,996
You swore!

218
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,377
Now there's no one
I can trust.

219
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,880
No one. There's no loyalty, no loyalty.

220
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,549
None, not even from you!

221
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,053
Where is she?

222
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:39,350
She was chased
into the Dark Forest,

223
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,851
where the men lost her.

224
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,772
She's no good to me
in the Dark Forest, lost!

225
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,026
I need her heart!
You failed me, Finn!

226
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,862
Have I not
given all to you!

227
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,539
Have I

228
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,208
not given you all?

229
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,254
Yes, sister.

230
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,223
Quiet.

231
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,061
I have no powers
in the Dark Forest.

232
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,899
You have to find me someone.

233
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,445
Someone who knows it.

234
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,740
Someone who can hunt her.

235
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,831
You owe me money
from my pocket

236
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,082
and money for the girl.

237
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,918
Well, you know, I seem
to have drunk it all,

238
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,004
but you're welcome to it
when it comes out again.

239
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,930
You've gone too far.
I want my money!

240
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,974
Here it is!

241
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,641
The Queen
demands your presence.

242
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,060
Can't you see
I'm having a bath?

243
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,065
Trust me on this, sister.

244
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,277
All right! All right!

245
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,279
Hey!

246
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:08,958
My brother tells me you
are a widower. A drunkard.

247
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,836
And one of few who has
ventured into the Dark Forest.

248
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,046
Aye.

249
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,173
One of my prisoners
has escaped there.

250
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,800
- Then he's dead.
- She.

251
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,260
She is certainly dead.

252
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,014
Find her.

253
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,350
Bring her to me.

254
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,519
No, I've been to that
forest. I'm not going back.

255
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,855
You will be
rewarded handsomely.

256
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,190
What good is gold to me

257
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,192
if I'm lying dead with the
crows picking at my eyes?

258
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,197
Why is she of such value?

259
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,366
That is none
of your concern.

260
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,535
I'll determine what
concerns me, thank you.

261
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:48,080
You will do this for me,
huntsman!

262
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,709
And if I refuse?

263
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,464
Do me the favor,
I beg of you.

264
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,508
To his knees.

265
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,475
So you wish to be reunited
with your beloved?

266
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,605
You do not
speak of my wife.

267
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,027
You miss her.

268
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:30,623
What would you give
to see her again?

269
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,210
You know of my powers.

270
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,756
Bring me the girl

271
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,217
and I will bring back
your wife.

272
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,720
Nothing can bring her back.

273
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,263
I can.

274
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,271
A life

275
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,274
for a life.

276
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,084
She can't have gone far.

277
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,630
All right,
do exactly as I do.

278
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,676
It's a bad idea.

279
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,953
Stay here.

280
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,348
- Come here.
- No!

281
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:58,604
Will you help me?

282
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,315
Please, the Queen
is going to kill me.

283
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:02,483
Sure she is.

284
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,443
She's going
to rip out my heart.

285
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,653
Quick work.

286
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,530
Hey.

287
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,073
Well done, huntsman.

288
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,576
Hand her over.

289
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,039
What do you intend
to do with her?

290
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,957
Why do you care?

291
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,084
You want her... Hey!

292
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,295
Give me what
I was promised.

293
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,214
You did your job well.

294
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,050
Now, keep your word.

295
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,344
- He'll kill us both.
- Shut up.

296
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,471
- He will.
- I said, shut up.

297
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,181
No, no.

298
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,600
I'll keep my word
when the Queen keeps hers.

299
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,893
Where's my wife?

300
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,647
He's going
to betray you.

301
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,151
My sister has many powers.

302
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:50,989
She can take life away,
or sustain it,

303
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:56,912
but she can't bring your wife
back from the dead, you fool!

304
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,414
I want her back!

305
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:05,188
I will find you!

306
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,532
Quiet. All right?

307
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,915
Hey, what the
hell's going on?

308
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,875
Who are you? Why does
the Queen want you dead?

309
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,209
She wants everyone
dead, all of us.

310
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,628
What makes you
so damn valuable?

311
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,422
You should know,
you're the one hunting me.

312
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:36,595
Forget it.

313
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,392
I should have never got
involved in the Queen's business.

314
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,394
What did I get in?
Stupid...

315
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,529
Where are you going?

316
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,567
Getting away from you. You're
trouble, is what you are.

317
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,863
I need to get to the Duke's
castle. There's an army there.

318
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,574
Oh, the Duke's army?

319
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,411
Bunch of farmers and
milkmaids with pitchforks.

320
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,749
I know sheep that
have more fight in them.

321
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,042
I'm valuable.

322
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,252
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

323
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,799
If you return without me,
you're dead.

324
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,718
If you leave me,
I'm dead.

325
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,767
Just for argument's sake,
how much reward?

326
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,143
However much is enough.

327
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,271
- At least thirty gold pieces...
- A hundred.

328
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,567
Help me.

329
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:35,946
Who are you?

330
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,448
Maybe you should have
asked the Queen that.

331
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,950
I don't trust you.

332
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,620
- I've given you my word.
- I still don't trust you.

333
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,249
But you have a deal.

334
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,429
Give me that,
before you lose a finger.

335
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,813
She killed my brave lain
with just the palm of her hand

336
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,065
and then she drew a dagger
from her side with no blood.

337
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,984
She cannot be killed.

338
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,487
But there is more.

339
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,366
The Princess is alive.

340
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,704
Where is my son?

341
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:23,845
We have word
of the Princess.

342
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,390
Ravenna has kept her,
all these years.

343
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:30,894
She lives?

344
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,856
She escaped the castle,
into the Dark Forest.

345
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,401
I'm going after her.

346
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,195
We don't know
if she survived.

347
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,279
William!

348
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,698
What?

349
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:47,077
You ventured beyond the castle
walls again, disobeying my orders.

350
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,079
We're all that's left,
don't you understand?

351
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,249
I cannot afford to
lose any more of my men.

352
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,416
I'm going alone.

353
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,545
I will not lose
my only son.

354
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,965
You don't know
the Dark Forest.

355
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,134
Then I'll find
somebody who does.

356
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,427
I will not abandon her
a second time.

357
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,675
The forest gains its
strength from your weakness.

358
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,980
Do you drink
to drown your sorrows?

359
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,982
Or your conscience?

360
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,526
What concern is it
of yours, why I drink?

361
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,653
I suppose a man's
sorrows are his own.

362
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:07,324
What does a young girl
like you know about sorrow?

363
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,379
Don't flatter yourself.

364
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,089
Now stay close.

365
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,766
You men know the dark forest?

366
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,733
Load and prepare.

367
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,819
You ride for
50 gold pieces.

368
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:49,741
Does it not trouble you
to serve her?

369
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,327
Who the Queen?

370
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,164
I serve no one.

371
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,420
Especially that old hag, and any
other royalty. They're all damned.

372
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,217
The King and his true
queen are not damned.

373
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,085
The King?

374
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,054
He's the one that let
the devil in the door.

375
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,391
It's his fault the kingdom's
plunged into darkness.

376
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:17,644
From you?

377
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,062
You know nothing.

378
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,313
What? And you do?

379
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,733
What's a wee scrod like you
care about the King anyway?

380
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,610
You're barely old enough
to remember him.

381
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:27,737
The land is diseased.

382
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,406
Nature is upturned.

383
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,534
This, this is the legacy
of your precious king.

384
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:58,727
Do you need a bowman?

385
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,231
I have a bowman.

386
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,693
Kill him.

387
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,201
I said, do you
need a bowman?

388
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,052
Here, I want
to show you something.

389
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,807
Which is your lead foot?

390
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,188
If someone comes at you,
you raise this arm up

391
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,149
and you block, and use
their strength against them.

392
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,235
You're small, so wait
until they're close

393
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,697
and you drive it through
their heart to the hilt.

394
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,700
You understand?
Do not hesitate.

395
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,160
You look in their eyes

396
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,871
and do not pull it out
until you see their soul.

397
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,634
I couldn't do that.

398
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,638
Well, you might not
have a choice.

399
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,450
We have their trail.

400
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,040
Move on. Move on!

401
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,780
Wait.

402
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,617
Is this the edge
of the Dark Forest?

403
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,827
Aye.

404
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:24,030
What is it?

405
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,054
Troll!

406
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,817
Go!

407
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,368
Run!

408
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,084
I told you to run.

409
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,128
If I had,
you would be dead.

410
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,660
Only demons or spirits pass through
the Dark Forest. Which are you?

411
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,705
We're fugitives
from the Queen.

412
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,999
We mean you no harm.

413
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,832
Where are all the men?

414
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:57,502
Gone.

415
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,401
Have you got
nothing to drink?

416
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,906
You have traveled far

417
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,743
and carried
a great burden.

418
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,246
I've had worse jobs.

419
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:38,543
Anyway,
she's not that heavy.

420
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:44,048
You don't know
who she is.

421
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,551
What do you mean?

422
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,099
Why? Who is she?

423
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,936
Maybe it needs a skirt,
or a dress or something?

424
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:58,813
That's nice.

425
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,731
How about a face?

426
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,567
Your mother
wants to see you.

427
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,955
Why didn't you tell me?

428
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,793
Because I'd think
it was too difficult a task?

429
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,462
You would be right.

430
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,135
I didn't trust you.

431
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,057
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

432
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,716
Our scars protect us.

433
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:12,136
Without beauty, we are
worthless to the Queen.

434
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,889
It's a sacrifice we made

435
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,309
so we could raise
our children in peace

436
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,854
while their fathers
are at war.

437
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,940
And you,

438
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,359
your sacrifice will come.

439
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,698
You must rest.

440
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,015
How can you desert her
when you know the truth?

441
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,934
Aye, I know the truth.

442
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:03,187
That's why she should be as
far away from me as possible.

443
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,481
Anything I ever cared about
was taken away from me.

444
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,109
Not this time.

445
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,569
She's safer here with you.

446
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,141
Lily! Lily, come on!

447
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:41,684
Come on!

448
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,817
Run, rats, run!

449
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:58,701
Find her!

450
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,453
Come on!

451
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,290
Get in the boats!
Get in the boats!

452
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:05,625
Lily!

453
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:36,549
In there, baby.
There you go.

454
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:40,636
Come on!

455
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,889
No! No!

456
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:49,895
Come on! Let's go!

457
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,439
No! We have to help them!

458
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,732
You will. Go.

459
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,817
- Come on!
- Go!

460
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:28,058
Your beauty is all that
can save you, Ravenna.

461
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:33,481
This spell will make your
beauty your power and protection.

462
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:39,904
By fairest blood
it is done.

463
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,572
Here. Drink, drink!

464
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:47,828
But, be warned.

465
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:51,457
By fairest blood,
this spell can be undone.

466
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,924
Avenge us!

467
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

468
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,840
- I'm sorry.
- You're not.

469
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,174
- I am.
- You left us.

470
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,638
We should never
have been there.

471
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,726
Hey, look at me.

472
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,729
I'll take you to
Duke Hammond's, okay?

473
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,314
All right?

474
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,068
You have my word.

475
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,322
Wait!

476
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,710
This is our lucky day.

477
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:20,004
Oh, no. Dwarves.

478
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:23,048
The hedge-pig I loathe most in
the world lands right in our lap.

479
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,425
Come on, Beith.

480
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:25,885
Is this how
you treat a friend?

481
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,762
Oh! No, no, no,
you puttock.

482
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,556
This is how
I treat a friend.

483
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,268
She's pretty.

484
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:36,562
And who's this?

485
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,398
Is this an errant apprentice
or captive?

486
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,566
This man is helping me.

487
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:41,859
We should kill them both.

488
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:43,402
He's caused us
nothing but trouble.

489
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,197
Skewer him and leave her to
rot. I don't like killing girls.

490
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,199
- I do.
- Good.

491
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,618
Leave her alone, Duir.

492
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,748
He's got nothing. One silver
coin and an empty codpiece.

493
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,709
Two days we sat here.
What for?

494
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,252
Nothing.

495
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:02,630
We should have stayed by the
river. What a waste of time!

496
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,758
Cut us down, Beith.
I have gold I can pay you.

497
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:08,928
It's not here, it's
hidden back in the woods.

498
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,763
Shut your ugly mug,
huntsman.

499
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:14,308
If you had any pennies, you would
have pissed it away on mead by now.

500
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:15,643
Cut us down,
then I'll show you.

501
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,311
Pull the other one,
you lying dangler.

502
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,481
Tell them the truth, huntsman.
There's no time!

503
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:23,984
I have to take this girl to
Hammond's. She's not safe here.

504
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,820
Well, my little heart
bleeds for you.

505
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,614
We should chop them up
and feed them to the wolves.

506
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,990
Yeah. Yes!

507
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,533
Who is she?

508
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,452
She's worth
a lot of gold to me.

509
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,996
Which I am happy to share
with you stupid little dwarves.

510
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:37,581
Stop that!

511
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:40,292
Gold is worth nothing to any
of you if you're all dead!

512
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,794
The Queen's men hunt us!

513
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,129
- They're very close!
- Shut up!

514
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,298
You have love
for the Queen?

515
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,759
We have no love
for the Queen.

516
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:50,052
Then you fight against her?

517
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,595
No one fights
against the Queen.

518
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:53,973
We lost everything
when the King died.

519
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,432
We fight only
for ourselves!

520
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,600
Yes.

521
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,311
My father was King Magnus.

522
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:08,654
Muir,

523
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,782
does she speak the truth?

524
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,828
Yes. She is of the blood.

525
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,290
She is destined, Beith.

526
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,337
I see an end
to the darkness.

527
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:30,884
Riders!

528
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,177
They found us!

529
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,887
If you don't cut us down,
we'll all be killed!

530
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,181
I don't like this, Beith.
It smells like trouble.

531
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,726
You'll find your weight in
gold if you cut us down, now!

532
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:39,893
Shut up, Princess.

533
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,854
Queen's riders!

534
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:43,897
And they're coming
this way!

535
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,025
We'll take her,
but not him!

536
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,568
What?

537
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:49,028
No, both of us!

538
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,696
Cut them both down, Gort!

539
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,364
Let's get the hell
out of here!

540
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,241
Move it! Move it!

541
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,530
They're close.

542
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,228
Blasted fairy music.

543
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,814
Yeah.

544
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,358
Good thing there's
plenty of moss about.

545
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:58,991
Where are we?

546
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,494
They call it Sanctuary,
my lady.

547
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,538
It's the home
of the fairies.

548
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,043
Fairies.

549
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,021
Clear!

550
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,856
Coll?

551
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,402
Clear!

552
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,240
Set up camp!

553
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,534
Gus. Quert.
Make the fire.

554
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,412
Gort, your mug.

555
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,143
Play louder,
you whey-face,

556
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,729
I can still hear
them harpy fairies.

557
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:18,904
Duir, would you really
have killed her?

558
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:20,572
Yeah.

559
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,241
Of course.

560
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:46,139
That seat's not taken, if that's
what you were about to ask.

561
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,771
I want to thank you.

562
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,273
It's only a log.

563
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,984
There's no need
to thank me.

564
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,402
No, for before.

565
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:00,612
For defending me.

566
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:03,949
Ah. Your father
was a good man.

567
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,118
The kingdom prospered.

568
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:07,953
Our people prospered.

569
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,790
There were more of you.

570
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,375
- Aye.
- Yeah.

571
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,795
The men you see before you

572
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,757
and many, many more,
went deep into the caves.

573
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:25,304
We were noble gold miners

574
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,307
because we could see
the light in the darkness.

575
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,477
Gus. Gus?

576
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,982
You were just a boy,
but you remember.

577
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:40,152
When we returned
to the surface,

578
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,156
there was nothing.

579
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:45,824
The land was blackened.

580
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,952
Everything,
everyone was gone.

581
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,498
Was dead.

582
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:57,502
That was the month
your father died.

583
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:00,088
I'm very sorry.

584
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:03,508
As am I, Princess.
As am I.

585
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:07,346
Son, play a happy song.

586
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,683
â™ª Why spend your leisure
Bereft of pleasure â™ª

587
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:15,020
â™ª Amassing treasure
Why scrape and save? â™ª

588
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,732
â™ª Why look so canny
At ev'ry penny? â™ª

589
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,693
â™ª You'll take no money
within the graveâ™ª

590
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,697
I know I'm a bit gicky,

591
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,200
but would you care
for a dance?

592
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,535
I'd be honored, Gus.

593
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,539
â™ª Our glasses clinking
And round and round â™ª

594
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,542
â™ª Is iomaÃ­ slÃ­ sin
Do bhÃ­os ag daoine â™ª

595
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,587
â™ª Ag cruinniÃº pÃ­osaÃ­
Is ag dÃ©anamh stÃ³ir â™ª

596
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,715
â™ª So, lads and lasses
Because life passes â™ª

597
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:47,886
â™ª Come fill your glasses
for another round â™ª

598
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,394
I don't trust her,
and I don't believe her.

599
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,896
No matter what Muir says.

600
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,981
I feel peculiar.

601
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,566
Queer almost.

602
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,901
What? Since when?

603
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:06,405
I'm tingling all over,
but I feel lovely.

604
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,073
I feel lovely.

605
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,492
How's your gout?

606
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:11,910
Gout?

607
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:16,206
It's a bit better.

608
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,416
And my cough.

609
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,418
You know,

610
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,920
this is her doing.

611
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,256
How much have
you had to drink?

612
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:26,174
No, it was the mushrooms.

613
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,029
Send a log downstream.

614
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,101
â™ª With hump for tramel
The scripture's camel â™ª

615
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:39,187
Still fleecing us out
of our bevvy, huntsman?

616
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,692
What do you say
we let bygones be bygones?

617
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,610
Not yet, nut-hook.

618
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:51,783
Hug.

619
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:54,578
â™ª Come fill your glasses
for another round â™ª

620
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,789
â™ª Is iomaÃ­ slÃ­ sin
Do bhÃ­os ag daoine â™ª

621
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,458
So what's in it for you?

622
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,085
What are you talking about?

623
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,045
I'm talking about the girl.

624
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:10,594
â™ª Come fill your glasses
for another round â™ª

625
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:13,305
Is it really
just the gold?

626
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,141
I'm not sure, Beith.

627
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,187
If I had any sense, I'd
have abandoned her long ago.

628
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,647
Muir says she's destined.

629
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,901
Question is, huntsman,

630
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:27,944
for what?

631
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:29,654
Hmm?

632
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:01,371
Get up.

633
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:21,808
Father? What was that? Father?

634
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,935
I know, son, I know.

635
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:25,770
It's him.

636
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:28,625
No, no, no, huntsman.

637
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:31,169
No one's ever
seen this before.

638
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,705
The white hart bows before
the Princess, Father.

639
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,208
He's blessing her.

640
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,335
What are you talking about?

641
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:15,880
You have eyes, huntsman,
but you do not see.

642
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,842
You, who have been
with her the longest.

643
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,678
She is life itself.

644
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,472
She will heal the land.

645
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:27,058
She is the one.

646
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:35,900
Can't you feel it?
Are your ailments not gone?

647
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:38,486
Gold or no gold,

648
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,489
where she leads,
I follow.

649
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:42,907
- Aye.
- I'm with you.

650
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,075
Yes, Father.

651
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:50,999
Ambush!

652
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,209
Aim low! Aim low!

653
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:06,473
Coll, Duir, take him.

654
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:09,768
Gus, go with her.

655
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,404
- Stay with me.
- Don't you wait for me.

656
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,039
You first.

657
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,082
I know.

658
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:52,602
Go. That way.

659
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,187
Go, go!

660
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,370
No, no, it's me!
It's William.

661
01:19:52,872 --> 01:19:53,913
It's William.

662
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:11,222
I admire your fight,
huntsman.

663
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,059
Your wife was the same.

664
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:16,561
What do you know
of my wife?

665
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,062
I remember them all.

666
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:22,817
But especially

667
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:26,070
the ones with fight.

668
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,576
She screamed your name,

669
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:34,996
but you weren't there.

670
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:48,343
Now, you can beg her
forgiveness in the Otherworld.

671
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:07,987
Sister,

672
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:10,907
heal me.

673
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,047
Forgive me, brother.

674
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,637
I feel...

675
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:02,709
Arrow!

676
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,520
Gus. Gus!

677
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,861
Gus, breathe.
Gus, breathe.

678
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,380
I won't leave you, miss.

679
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,718
We used to have pride.

680
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,888
And now we just
pilfer and drink

681
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,266
and dream about
when we didn't.

682
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:47,939
Every man here would die for the
chance of becoming that man again.

683
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,609
So, we follow you, Princess,

684
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:54,070
in life and in death.

685
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,239
And we shall
have our pride again.

686
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:01,035
On Gus's soul,
this I swear.

687
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:23,057
â™ª Dark the stars
And dark the moon â™ª

688
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:31,315
â™ª Hush the night
And the morning loon â™ª

689
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:38,739
â™ª Tell the horses
And beat on your drum â™ª

690
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:45,496
â™ª Gone their master
Gone their sun â™ª

691
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:53,337
â™ª Dark the oceans
Dark the sky â™ª

692
01:24:54,089 --> 01:25:00,052
â™ª Hush the whales
And the ocean tide â™ª

693
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:08,269
â™ª Tell the salt marsh
And beat on your drum â™ª

694
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:12,732
â™ª Gone their master â™ª

695
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:16,944
â™ª Gone their sun â™ª

696
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:25,786
â™ª Dark to light
And light to dark â™ª

697
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:33,252
â™ª Three black carriages
Three white carts â™ª

698
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:43,554
â™ª What brings us together's
What pulls us apart â™ª

699
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:54,649
â™ª Gone our brother
Gone our heart â™ª

700
01:25:57,236 --> 01:25:59,111
I'm sorry I left you.

701
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,323
You didn't.

702
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:06,369
If I'd have thought
you were alive,

703
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:08,537
I would have come for you.

704
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,123
We were children, William.

705
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,752
You're here now.

706
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:37,233
â™ª Hush the whales
And the ocean tide â™ª

707
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:46,701
â™ª Tell the salt marsh
And beat on your drum â™ª

708
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:56,961
â™ª Gone their master
Gone their sun â™ª

709
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,205
Here.

710
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:53,059
She hasn't changed.

711
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,730
She has that same
light inside her.

712
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,528
You must see it.

713
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,948
You'd be blind
if you didn't.

714
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:16,540
Thought about her every
day since I lost her.

715
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,588
I can hardly believe
I found her.

716
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:27,343
You should tell her
how you feel.

717
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:28,469
It'd be good for her.

718
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:29,553
No.

719
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,931
I wouldn't know how.

720
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:36,644
Your not telling someone
something like that

721
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:39,730
and living with the regret

722
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,233
is a lot worse.

723
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:07,716
William.

724
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:13,472
It's as if nothing's
changed here.

725
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,060
The world seems

726
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:19,687
beautiful again.

727
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:20,938
It will be,

728
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:23,566
when you are queen.

729
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,612
The people of this kingdom
hate Ravenna with every fiber.

730
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:32,449
I used to hate her.

731
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:36,203
But now I feel only sorrow.

732
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:38,706
Once people
find out you're alive,

733
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,040
they will rise up
in your name.

734
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,211
It takes more
than a name.

735
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,673
You are
your father's daughter.

736
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:49,842
The rightful heir.

737
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,888
If I had a choice,
I'd take you far away.

738
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:59,476
Keep you safe by my side.

739
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:03,731
But I have a duty.
And so do you.

740
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,317
How do I inspire?

741
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:09,820
How will I lead men?

742
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:14,074
The way you led me
when we were children.

743
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:17,828
I followed you everywhere.

744
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,957
I ran when you called.

745
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:26,170
I would have done
anything for you.

746
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,548
That's not
how I remember it.

747
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:32,009
- No?
- No.

748
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:35,888
And we used to fight
all the time.

749
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,557
And argue.

750
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,420
Do you remember that trick?

751
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,172
What trick?

752
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,493
You see, child,

753
01:31:41,288 --> 01:31:43,956
love always betrays us.

754
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,309
Wake up.

755
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:40,220
By fairest blood
it was done,

756
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:44,975
and only by fairest blood

757
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,604
can it be undone.

758
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:53,734
You were the only one

759
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:57,404
who could break the spell
and destroy me.

760
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:09,375
And the only one

761
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:11,502
pure enough

762
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:15,130
to save me.

763
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:21,804
You don't even realize
how lucky you are

764
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:25,349
never to know
what it is to grow old.

765
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:26,642
No!

766
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:53,168
No.

767
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:12,229
No. No.

768
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:18,694
What are you looking at?
Do something!

769
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:20,404
You're dwarves, healers.

770
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:22,656
Save her. Help her.

771
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:30,914
No. This cannot be.

772
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:39,590
Please, please.

773
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:22,633
Please.

774
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:27,471
What do we do, Beith?

775
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:30,182
What we promised.

776
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:38,560
Well, here you are.

777
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:42,439
All dressed up,
like you're about to

778
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:44,608
wake up and give me
more grief. Am I right?

779
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:57,954
You deserved better.

780
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:04,878
I once had a wife,
Princess.

781
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:10,300
Sara was her name.

782
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:13,136
When I came back
from the wars,

783
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:15,180
I carried with me
the stench of death

784
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:17,474
and the anger of the lost.

785
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:22,396
I wasn't worth saving, that's
for sure. But she did so anyway.

786
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:26,441
And I loved her so much.

787
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,778
I loved her more than
anyone or anything.

788
01:38:29,946 --> 01:38:33,824
And then I let her out of
my sight and she was gone.

789
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:40,288
And I became myself again.

790
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:42,749
A self I never cared for.

791
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:49,131
Until you.

792
01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:55,095
See, you remind me of her.

793
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,933
Her heart. Her spirit.

794
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:06,356
But now you, too,
have gone.

795
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:10,569
You both deserved better,
and I'm so sorry I failed you.

796
01:39:11,404 --> 01:39:13,029
I'm so sorry.

797
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:23,540
But you'll be a queen
in heaven now

798
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:26,334
and sit among the angels.

799
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:16,176
She died for us!

800
01:40:16,803 --> 01:40:18,386
For our cause!

801
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:20,430
We cannot just hide
behind these walls

802
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:22,474
and watch this land
die with her!

803
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:25,644
Your grief clouds
your judgment, my son.

804
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:30,732
My grief makes me
see clearer, Father.

805
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:36,947
My duty is to protect those
people who come to me for help.

806
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:40,700
I will defend them
to the last drop of my blood,

807
01:40:41,786 --> 01:40:44,037
but I will not
abandon these walls.

808
01:41:05,184 --> 01:41:07,060
The spell is lifted.

809
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:40,051
Death has favored you.

810
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:41,928
Death favors no man.

811
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:43,972
We must ride

812
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:47,517
like thundering waves under the
tattered battle flag of my father.

813
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:49,102
You must rest.

814
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,105
We have rested
long enough.

815
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,700
Frost to fire
and fire to frost.

816
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:10,707
Iron will melt.

817
01:42:14,253 --> 01:42:17,380
But it will writhe
inside of itself!

818
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:21,468
All these years

819
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,638
all I've known is darkness.

820
01:42:26,891 --> 01:42:30,560
But I have never seen a brighter
light than when my eyes just opened.

821
01:42:32,438 --> 01:42:35,565
And I know that light
burns in all of you!

822
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:38,902
Those embers

823
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:41,905
must turn to flame.

824
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:46,451
Iron into sword!

825
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:48,578
I will become your weapon!

826
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:50,997
Forged by the fierce fire

827
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:53,291
that I know is
in your hearts!

828
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:57,796
For I have seen
what she sees.

829
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,633
I know what she knows.

830
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,929
I can kill her.

831
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:11,768
And I'd rather die today

832
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:16,147
than live another day
of this death!

833
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:20,944
And who will ride with me?

834
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,029
Who will be my brother?

835
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:25,115
Aye!

836
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:13,496
Farewell, Princess.

837
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,022
Where are they?

838
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:40,899
Amassed on the cliffs.

839
01:44:41,067 --> 01:44:43,026
Their numbers
have swollen.

840
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:46,112
They say the King's
standard flies again.

841
01:44:47,073 --> 01:44:48,615
Then let them come.

842
01:44:49,366 --> 01:44:53,578
And let them break their
skulls on these stone walls

843
01:44:53,954 --> 01:44:56,206
and bring me my prize.

844
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:13,765
My lord,

845
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:16,059
we only have a few hours
before the tide comes in.

846
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,394
Not long enough
to breach the castle walls.

847
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:19,979
Is there no other way in?

848
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:21,439
There is another way.

849
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:27,487
Hi-ho, lads,
it's off to work.

850
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:30,532
If he starts whistling,
I'll smash his face in.

851
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:36,579
Yes.

852
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:38,832
We're promised gold
and what do we get?

853
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:40,083
Poo!

854
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,043
How low has
the dwarf race sunk?

855
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:46,631
That looks like one of mine.

856
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:47,966
Hold this!

857
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:11,239
All right.

858
01:46:11,323 --> 01:46:13,074
The gatehouse
is 50 yards to the right.

859
01:46:13,242 --> 01:46:14,951
And there's a whole
army out there.

860
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:17,328
Six dwarves
against an army?

861
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:19,998
I like them odds.

862
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:24,586
We must ride now.
The portcullis will be open.

863
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:33,928
So, you're back from the dead
and instigating the masses.

864
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:40,018
You look very
fetching in mail.

865
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:45,940
We ride!

866
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:53,781
All right.
We move as one.

867
01:46:58,287 --> 01:46:59,495
After you.

868
01:47:14,637 --> 01:47:17,472
Hey, go, go, go.

869
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:36,759
Sorry.

870
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:41,889
What's happening, Coll?

871
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:43,308
They're on the beach!

872
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:51,274
Release!

873
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:34,150
Ready! Release!

874
01:49:39,156 --> 01:49:40,323
Release!

875
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:57,173
Go, go, go!

876
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,595
The summit's breached!

877
01:50:09,686 --> 01:50:11,020
Back here, lads!
Come on!

878
01:50:11,188 --> 01:50:12,688
Get back to it!

879
01:50:25,702 --> 01:50:27,662
- Pull!
- Nion, get on that rope!

880
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:29,580
- Come on!
- Go on!

881
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:31,749
Quert!

882
01:50:34,253 --> 01:50:35,294
It's a massacre
down there!

883
01:50:35,379 --> 01:50:37,171
Gort, on that rope!

884
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:40,383
We must turn back!

885
01:50:40,676 --> 01:50:43,177
No! I gave them my word!

886
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:44,679
It's over!
Get on now!

887
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:50,893
She's moving.

888
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:53,604
You done it, lads!

889
01:50:59,027 --> 01:51:00,695
Charge!

890
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:02,321
Ya!

891
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:14,834
Form! Form!

892
01:53:01,275 --> 01:53:02,692
William!

893
01:55:27,212 --> 01:55:30,506
Come and avenge
your father

894
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:34,593
who was too weak
to raise his sword.

895
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:40,808
Ah.

896
01:55:53,864 --> 01:55:54,864
Go on.

897
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:58,451
Watch them die.

898
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:16,218
How does it feel,

899
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:19,221
knowing you were the one
who led them to their deaths?

900
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:20,639
You see?

901
01:56:20,724 --> 01:56:23,434
We're not that different,
are we?

902
01:56:26,104 --> 01:56:27,730
I'm everything you're not.

903
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:53,798
You cannot defeat me!

904
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:58,052
I've lived too many lives.

905
01:56:58,470 --> 01:57:00,930
Ravaged entire kingdoms.

906
01:57:01,348 --> 01:57:05,476
I have been given powers that
you could not even fathom!

907
01:57:08,271 --> 01:57:09,688
I will never stop.

908
01:57:11,107 --> 01:57:12,525
Never.

909
01:57:14,653 --> 01:57:17,279
I will give
this wretched world

910
01:57:17,447 --> 01:57:21,867
the queen it deserves.

911
01:57:26,623 --> 01:57:29,667
By fairest blood,
it is done!

912
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:49,478
And only by fairest blood is it undone.

913
01:58:46,161 --> 01:58:48,537
You can't have my heart.

914
02:00:00,402 --> 02:00:04,321
In the name of all that is
good and just in this land

915
02:00:04,489 --> 02:00:06,448
I crown you queen.

916
02:00:49,075 --> 02:00:50,617
Hail to the Queen!

917
02:00:51,411 --> 02:00:53,287
Hail to the Queen!

918
02:00:53,663 --> 02:01:00,754
Hail to the Queen!

919
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,114
