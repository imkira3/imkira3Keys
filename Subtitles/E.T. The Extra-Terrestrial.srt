2
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,284
I think I see him!

3
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,550
This way!

4
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,656
- Five.
- Oh, great.

5
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,242
So you got an arrow right in your chest.
And you're out 10 melee rounds.

6
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,202
- Oh, no.
- Don't worry about it, Mike. I got resurrection.

7
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,747
I'm already one of the undead.
I can still throw death spells.

8
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,125
I'm just trying to help you out, man.
Don't be so cranky.

9
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,377
How about throwing a spell
over the pizza man?

10
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,754
Where's our pizza, man?

11
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,048
Well, I'm ready now to play.

12
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,176
I'm ready to play now, you guys.

13
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,679
We're in the middle, Elliott.
You can't just join any universe in the middle.

14
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,181
I got him! I got him!

15
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,391
What am I asking for?

16
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,146
- Yeah.
- Mike?

17
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,273
I know. It's not for us,
it's for his mother.

18
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,901
Mike?

19
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,196
You have to ask Steve.
He's game master.

20
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,031
He has absolute power.

21
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,992
- Steve?
- Steve, can I play now?

22
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,203
Go wait for the pizza first.

23
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,954
- Then I'm in?
- Yeah, you're in.

24
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,999
Figure out your strategy.
You're playing after Greg.

25
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,836
Plenty of sausage and pepperonis.

26
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,838
Everything but the little fishies.

27
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,166
Harvey?

28
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,919
Harvey, is that you, boy?

29
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,593
Over here, you guys.

30
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,762
- Stop it.
- Sorry.

31
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,022
Harvey?

32
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,190
All's you can get
is those 40-year-olds.

33
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,859
How do you win this game anyway?

34
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,820
There's no winning.
It's like life. You don't win at life.

35
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,863
Money helps.

36
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,283
- Mom! Mom! There's something out...
- Where's the pizza?

37
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,786
Mom! Mom! There's something out there!
It's in the tool shed.

38
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,705
It threw the ball at me.

39
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,415
Quiet!

40
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,376
Nobody go out there.

41
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,299
Stop. Now, you guys stay right here.

42
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,177
You stay here, Mom.
We'll check it out.

43
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,220
- And put those knives back!
- Come on, Mom!

44
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:23,640
It's okay, Elliott.

45
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,727
Let's go get the flashlight.

46
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,855
Hold it. Wait a minute.

47
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,525
Creeps. Creepy.

48
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,444
- What exactly did you see?
- It's dark out here.

49
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:36,988
In there.

50
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,200
It's scary.

51
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,206
There's nothing in here.

52
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,624
The gate's open.

53
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,459
Look at these.

54
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,384
Coyote's come back again, Mom.

55
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,886
Okay, party's over.
Everybody, back inside now.

56
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,388
Get out. Hurry up.

57
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,348
Quick. Hurry up. Come on.

58
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,100
Tyler, give me that knife.

59
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,646
Oh, great. Nice one, Elliott.

60
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,022
It was an accident.

61
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,734
A pizza?
Who said you guys could order a pizza?

62
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:16,894
Him.

63
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,697
- In the house.
- You geek, man.

64
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,867
- But Mom, it was real. I swear.
- Douche bag.

65
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,994
No douche-bag talk in my house.

66
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,061
Elliott, you're crazy.

67
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,690
Hello.

68
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,412
Hello?

69
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,591
What are you going as for Halloween?

70
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,259
I'm not going to stupid Halloween.

71
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,512
Why don't you go as a goblin?

72
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,805
Shut up.

73
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,932
It's not that we don't believe you, honey.

74
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,101
Well, it was real. I swear.

75
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,188
What are you going as, Gert?

76
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,066
I'm going as a cowgirl.

77
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,485
So what else is new?

78
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,489
- Maybe it was an iguana.
- It was no iguana.

79
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,573
Maybe a...

80
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,075
A...

81
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,619
You know how they say
there are alligators in the sewers?

82
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,621
Alligators in the sewers.

83
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,166
All we're trying to say is,
maybe you just probably imagined it.

84
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,043
I couldn't have imagined it.

85
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,129
Maybe it was a pervert
or a deformed kid or something.

86
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,964
A deformed kid.

87
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,800
Maybe an elf or a leprechaun.

88
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,094
It was nothing like that, penis breath!

89
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,221
Elliott!

90
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,472
Sit down.

91
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,853
Dad would believe me.

92
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,610
Maybe you ought to call your father
and tell him about it.

93
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,406
I can't. He's in Mexico with Sally.

94
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,753
Where's Mexico?

95
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,008
Excuse me.

96
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,598
I'm going to kill you.

97
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,269
If you ever see it again,
whatever it is,

98
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,104
don't touch it. Just call me.

99
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,023
And we'll have somebody come
and take it away.

100
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,484
Like the dogcatcher?

101
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:35,030
They'll give it a lobotomy
or do experiments on it or something.

102
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,784
It's your turn to do the dishes, fellas.

103
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,411
- I set and cleared.
- I set and cleared.

104
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,872
- I did breakfast.
- I did breakfast.

105
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,376
What's the matter, Mom?

106
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,924
He hates Mexico.

107
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,262
Damn it! Why don't you grow up?
Think how other people feel for a change.

108
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,336
Mom.

109
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,714
Mom. Mom!

110
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:16,923
Michael.

111
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,264
Michael. Mom.

112
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,791
Okay, you're hot.

113
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,877
I'll be back.

114
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,590
Mary, can I back the car out?

115
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,300
Not one foot past the driveway.

116
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:54,112
You were outside last night waiting for that thing
to come back, weren't you?

117
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,116
Are you going to live
if I go to work?

118
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,081
Okay. No TV.

119
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,134
Come on.

120
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,303
Mommy, look what Michael did.

121
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,512
This and that...

122
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,724
I see them, Gert.
And when I catch him, I'll catch him.

123
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,479
Come on. Don't be afraid.

124
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,399
It's all right. Come on.

125
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:43,161
Come on.

126
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,912
Come on.

127
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,248
Come on.

128
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,175
Do you talk?

129
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,761
You know, talk?

130
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,014
Me, human.

131
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,141
Boy.

132
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:10,396
Elliott.

133
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,024
Elliott.

134
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,455
Coke. See, we drink it.

135
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,209
It's a drink. You know, food?

136
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,545
These are toys.
These are little men.

137
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,923
This is Greedo.

138
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:40,093
And then, this is Hammerhead.

139
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:43,554
You see, this is Walrus Man.

140
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,265
And then this is Snaggletooth.

141
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,978
And this is Lando Calrissian. See?

142
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,065
And this is Boba Fett.

143
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,818
Look. They can even have wars.
Look at this.

144
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,741
And look. Fish.

145
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:09,288
The fish eat the fish food
and the shark eats the fish,

146
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,500
but nobody eats a shark.

147
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,256
See, this is Pez. Candy.

148
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,133
You see, you eat it.

149
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,344
You put the candy in here

150
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,348
and then when you lift up the head,
the candy comes out and you can eat it.

151
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,641
You want some?

152
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,604
This is a peanut.

153
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,939
You eat it.

154
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,693
But you can't eat this one
because this is fake.

155
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,529
This is money. You see?

156
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,699
We put the money in the peanut.

157
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,784
You see? Bank.

158
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,035
You see? And then,

159
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,998
this is a car.

160
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,041
This is what we get around in.

161
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,711
See? A car.

162
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,717
Hey! Hey! Wait a second.

163
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,928
No. You don't eat them.

164
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,097
Are you hungry?

165
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,184
I'm hungry.

166
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,730
Stay.

167
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,361
Stay. I'll be right here.

168
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,574
Okay? I'll be right here.

169
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,510
Harv!

170
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,537
He won't bite.

171
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,333
Come on, Harvey.

172
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,925
He'll like this.

173
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:55,895
This.

174
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,132
Are you okay?

175
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,429
Too much excitement, huh?

176
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,515
Want a Coke?

177
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:42,692
<i>There are so many people to see</i>

178
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:47,655
<i>So many people you can check up on
and add to your collection</i>

179
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,074
<i>But they keep you hanging on</i>

180
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,077
Nothing but health shit.

181
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:57,665
<i>Add to your collection
But they keep you hanging on</i>

182
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,672
Mike, Mike, come in.

183
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,674
- How you feeling, faker?
- I'm feeling fine.

184
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,259
Look, I got something really important...

185
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,596
Tyler said he got 69,000
on <i>Asteroids</i> yesterday.

186
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,432
- But he pulled the plug.
- Look, remember the goblin?

187
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,434
You're so lame, Elliott.

188
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,477
Come on, Michael.
He came back.

189
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,482
He came back?

190
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,859
Oh, my God!

191
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,652
One thing.

192
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,447
I have absolute power.

193
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,906
Say it.

194
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,909
- Say it!
- What have you got? Is it the coyote?

195
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,078
No. Look...

196
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:41,042
Okay. Now, swear it.

197
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,586
The most excellent promise you can make.

198
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,298
Swear as my only brother on our lives.

199
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,258
Okay, don't get so heavy. I swear.

200
00:32:49,743 --> 00:32:52,386
Okay. Stand over there.

201
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,805
And you'd better take off
your shoulder pads.

202
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,851
- What?
- You might scare him. And close your eyes.

203
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,437
Don't push it, Elliott.

204
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,440
I'm not coming out there
until your eyes are closed.

205
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,567
Okay. They're closed.

206
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,819
Mom is going to kill you.

207
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,950
Okay. Swear it one more time.

208
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:18,412
- I have absolute power.
- You have absolute power. Yes.

209
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,510
Elliott! Look what I made for you!

210
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,935
Stop! Stop!

211
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:42,937
Stop!

212
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,611
Kids, I'm home!

213
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:51,987
Guys?

214
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:55,032
- In the closet, fast.
- Anybody up there, kids?

215
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,870
Anybody home?

216
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,540
Hi, honey, how are you feel...

217
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,500
What happened in here?

218
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,837
Oh, you mean my room.

219
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,173
This is no room.

220
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,718
This is an accident.

221
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,845
I was reorganizing.

222
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,805
I can see that.

223
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,224
Put those shelves back on the wall, dear.

224
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,143
Let's get the toys off the floor.

225
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,521
Make your bed since you are not using it.

226
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,898
Well, you're feeling better, I see.

227
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,569
Will you guys keep an eye on Gertie for me
while I take a shower?

228
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,903
Absolutely.

229
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,031
Bye, Mom.

230
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:47,960
Elliott...

231
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,920
I'm keeping him.

232
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,341
What is it?

233
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,470
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

234
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,681
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

235
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:03,350
We're not going to hurt you.

236
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,479
Is he a boy or a girl?

237
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,314
He's a boy.

238
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,036
Was he wearing any clothes?

239
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:15,863
No.

240
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:20,743
But, look, you can't tell.
Not even Mom.

241
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,536
Why not?

242
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,664
Because grownups can't see him.

243
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,460
Only little kids can see him.

244
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,086
Give me a break.

245
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:34,924
Well, do you know what's going to happen

246
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,383
if you do tell?

247
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,222
Do it, Mike. We have to.

248
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,973
No, please!

249
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,476
No! I'll do anything, please!

250
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,354
Gertie, help me! No, please!

251
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,730
Give it!

252
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,565
- Promise?
- Yes.

253
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,318
Do you promise?

254
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,681
What are you doing, Gert?

255
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,642
I'm going to play in Elliott's room.

256
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,396
Okay. Don't let him torture you.

257
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,064
I won't, Mary.

258
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,364
Hello?

259
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,949
Jerry! Jerry!

260
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,999
Come on, come on. Hurry up.

261
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,628
Don't be pushy, pushy.

262
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,925
A plant for you.

263
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,595
Maybe he's some animal
that wasn't supposed to live.

264
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,722
You know, like those rabbits
we saw that time.

265
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,432
- Don't be lame.
- Green, orange, red.

266
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,267
Could be a monkey or an orangutan...

267
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,936
A bald monkey?

268
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,855
Is he a pig?
He sure eats like one.

269
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,358
You could make faces.

270
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:02,988
And make them mean and happy
and make them get sharp teeth.

271
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:04,573
We are here.

272
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,327
- We're here.
- No, use this.

273
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,412
You could make all sorts of things.

274
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,665
Okay. We're here.

275
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,541
We are here.

276
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,377
Where are you from?

277
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,016
I don't like his feet.

278
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,310
They're only feet,
you little twerp.

279
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,729
He's trying to tell us something.

280
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,657
Earth.

281
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,370
Home.

282
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,330
Home.

283
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,244
What's he doing?

284
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,080
What's happening?

285
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,303
Elliott.

286
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,140
Oh, no.

287
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,322
Elliott, what is it?

288
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,365
I don't know. Something scary.

289
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,055
- Got a pulse?
- No, boss.

290
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,937
Hold it. We got it right here.

291
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,648
Follow him.

292
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,027
You think this house?

293
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,309
Did you explain school to him?

294
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,812
How do you explain school
to higher intelligence?

295
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,939
Maybe he's not that smart.
Maybe he's a worker bee

296
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,316
- who only knows how to push buttons.
- He's too smart.

297
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,986
Okay, I just hope
we don't wake up on Mars or something,

298
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,655
surrounded by millions
of little squashy guys.

299
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,122
Hi, Elliott.

300
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,583
- Hey, Elliott, where's your goblin?
- Shut up.

301
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:43,959
Did he come back?

302
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,586
Well, did he?

303
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,130
Yeah, he came back.

304
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,507
But he's not a goblin.
He's a spaceman.

305
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,969
As in extraterrestrial.

306
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:57,639
Where's he from? Uranus?
Get it? Your anus?

307
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,350
- He doesn't get it, Ty.
- Get it? Your anus?

308
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,519
- He doesn't get it.
- You're so immature.

309
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,188
And you're a sine supremus.

310
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,691
- Zero charisma.
- Sine supremus.

311
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,067
Shut up, Greg!

312
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,195
- Sine supremus.
- Zero charisma!

313
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,446
You wimp.

314
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,249
Let's go.

315
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,547
Come on. Get in the car.
We're gonna be late.

316
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:18,595
Okay, boys and girls,
today we will be doing the actual frog dissection

317
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,139
for which we've been preparing.

318
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:26,228
And you will find many similarities.

319
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:37,197
As you get into the dissection,
you will discover that the anatomy...

320
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,606
The scalpel is very sharp.

321
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,569
Use discretion when you are cutting.

322
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:20,073
There will be very little blood.
There may be a few body fluids.

323
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,836
As we get started with the dissection...

324
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:20,217
remember that the things
that you are writing down...

325
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:35,732
One thing that you should be looking for
during the dissection

326
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:39,486
is to locate the heart
and notice that it is still beating.

327
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,368
I'm going to once more
emphasize the similarities

328
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,995
of those things which we see in the...

329
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,002
Similarities with human anatomy...

330
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,005
First of all, here's the heart...

331
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:11,184
The intestines will be going through
their peristaltic action.

332
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:15,939
<i>X-W-V-U.</i>

333
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,817
<i>A-F-P.</i>

334
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,863
<i>That is incorrect.
The correct spelling of nuisance is</i>

335
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:28,201
<i>N-U-I-S-A-N-C-E.</i>

336
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,084
<i>They're pulling us up.</i>

337
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:46,720
Class, these are the cotton balls
with the chloroform.

338
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:51,725
And as soon as I get them all in,
be sure and put the lid on right away.

339
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,727
That's it.

340
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,229
That will start them going to sleep.

341
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:03,320
And they won't feel anything.
They won't be hurt.

342
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,365
It'll take a little while.

343
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:11,036
If you don't want to watch them,
you don't have to.

344
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:31,890
Say hi.

345
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:34,518
Can you talk?

346
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:36,645
Can you say hi?

347
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,004
<i>Hello.</i>

348
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,589
<i>Uncle Ralph!</i>

349
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:07,509
<i>It's Uncle Ralph,
long distance from California!</i>

350
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,262
<i>I'll talk fast.
This call must be expensive.</i>

351
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:13,598
<i>No, no, no, no. If I call anytime
on Saturday without an operator,</i>

352
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:16,351
<i>I can talk for five minutes
for 85 cents plus tax.</i>

353
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,979
<i>If I talk less, I pay less.</i>

354
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,772
<i>Let me talk to that little fella.</i>

355
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,983
<i>Lou, it's Uncle Ralph.</i>

356
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,359
<i>Hello, Uncle Ralph.</i>

357
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,923
Save him.

358
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:57,350
Run for your life!
Back to the river! Back to the forest!

359
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:00,854
Run! I want to save you!

360
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,939
Let's get out of here!

361
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,235
Get out!

362
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,029
I got to let him go!

363
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,163
You've got to save him!

364
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:44,939
Let me handle this!

365
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:48,652
Class. Let me handle this!
I can handle this.

366
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:49,986
Let me get this.

367
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,917
<i>Grandpa, what's wrong?</i>

368
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,295
<i>I'm afraid Betsy Sue
isn't going to run tomorrow.</i>

369
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,215
<i>Oh, no. Is it anything serious?</i>

370
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,926
Harvey, I'm home.
Come here, boy.

371
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,022
Here he is.

372
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,733
Here's who?

373
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:13,069
The man from the moon,
but I think you've killed him already.

374
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:15,822
Honey, just as soon
as I unload the stuff, okay?

375
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:23,413
Med-bugs.

376
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,542
I want you to meet somebody.

377
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,878
This stuff has gone up
so much in one week.

378
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,421
I want you to meet somebody.

379
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,133
Okay, honey, as soon as I finish
putting all this stuff away, all right?

380
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,438
Stupid ragù.
I knew it wouldn't come out.

381
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,525
- <i>"B."</i>
- "B."

382
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,360
What's with this?

383
00:51:57,907 --> 00:51:59,073
Hello.

384
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,118
Yeah, this is she.

385
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,745
"Basket."

386
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:04,954
"Bandit."

387
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,164
"Ball."

388
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,875
"Basket. Bandit. Ball."

389
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,461
"Bugs."

390
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,670
"Bananas."

391
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:15,465
Intoxicated?

392
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,639
You sure you have the right Elliott?

393
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,766
"B. B."

394
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,685
- "Biscuits."
- B.

395
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,355
<i>But "B" is for boy...</i>

396
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:31,731
B.

397
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,691
<i>with a baseball and bat.</i>

398
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,653
You said "B."

399
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:38,404
B.

400
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,241
You said "B." Good.

401
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:43,910
B.

402
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,579
Good.

403
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:49,082
Okay, I'll be right down. Thank you.

404
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,170
Gertie, I have to go pick up Elliott.

405
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:57,257
- Will you be a good girl...
- Mommy, he can talk.

406
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:01,094
Of course he can talk. I'll be right back
in 10 minutes. Stay there.

407
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:06,140
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
little Grover here will demonstrate</i>

408
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:09,352
<i>by chinning himself two times.</i>

409
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,895
- <i>Two times?</i>
- <i>Two times.</i>

410
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,147
- <i>Can I start?</i>
- <i>Okay. Go ahead.</i>

411
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,732
<i>Okay. Here we go.</i>

412
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,109
Phone.

413
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:17,902
Phone.

414
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,112
Phone.

415
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,615
Phone.

416
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,329
You want to call somebody?

417
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,708
I am not paying for frogs.

418
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,794
Be good. Be good.

419
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,797
Stay here. Stay.

420
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,426
And don't tell anybody. Nobody.

421
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,429
Be good. Be good.

422
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,141
Move.

423
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,398
Oh, God!

424
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,358
- Elliott.
- What?

425
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:58,776
Elliott.

426
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,403
Elliott.

427
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:04,240
I taught him how to talk now.
He can talk now.

428
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,366
Elliott!

429
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:07,702
Look what he brought up here
all by himself.

430
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:08,786
Elliott.

431
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,246
What's he need this stuff for?

432
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:12,040
Elliott. Elliott.

433
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,626
E.T. Can you say that?

434
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,419
Can you say E.T.?

435
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,756
E.T.

436
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,217
E.T. E.T. E.T.

437
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:24,594
Be good.

438
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,888
"Be good." I taught him that, too.

439
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,765
You should give him his dignity.

440
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:31,351
This is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever seen!

441
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:33,770
Phone.

442
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,773
Phone?

443
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:40,318
He said "phone"?

444
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,780
Can't you understand English?
He said "phone."

445
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,035
Home.

446
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:52,205
You're right. That's E.T.'s home.

447
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,465
E.T.

448
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:05,301
Home, phone.

449
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,558
E.T. phone home.

450
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:18,106
E.T. phone home.
E.T. phone home.

451
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,899
He wants to call somebody.

452
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:29,993
- What's all this shit?
- E.T. phone home.

453
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,869
Oh, my God, he's talking now.

454
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,205
Home.

455
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,250
E.T. phone home?

456
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,920
E.T. phone home.

457
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,009
And they'll come?

458
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,635
Come.

459
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:52,598
Home.

460
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,602
- <i>Come on. I promise, Mom.</i>
- <i>What book?</i>

461
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,938
- <i>Any one you want.</i>
- Spiderman...

462
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,357
<i>I'm fine.
We'll just put a smile on our face</i>

463
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:04,110
<i>and try to get through the evening.
That's all I want to do.</i>

464
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,946
<i>We can't ask Cathy
to go trick-or-treating</i>

465
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,282
<i>in the same old sheet
she wore last year.</i>

466
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:13,202
<i>Now I wish I would've listened in science.</i>

467
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,787
<i>Think, Michael.</i>

468
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,706
I guess we should just grab anything that

469
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,458
looks like he could make a machine out of.

470
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,044
What would make a radar?

471
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,713
How the hell do I know?
You're the genius here.

472
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,466
You have absolute power, remember?

473
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,718
"I found him. He belongs to me."

474
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:43,983
You know, Elliott,

475
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:49,030
- he doesn't look too good anymore.
- Don't say that! We're fine!

476
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,491
What's all this "we" stuff?

477
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,368
<i>You say "we" all the time now.</i>

478
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:57,080
- <i>Really, Elliott, I think he may be getting sick.</i>
- <i>Look, he's fine.</i>

479
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:00,583
<i>Okay, okay. Forget I mentioned it.</i>

480
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,543
<i>Grab that Fuzzbuster.</i>

481
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,845
Dad's shirt.

482
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:20,019
Remember when he used to take us out
to the ball games

483
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:23,523
and take us to the movies,
and we'd have popcorn fights?

484
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:27,693
- <i>We'll do that again, Elliott.</i>
- <i>Sure.</i>

485
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,745
Old Spice.

486
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,580
Sea Breeze.

487
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,965
"Peter says, 'The redskins were defeated?

00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:02,895
"Tink alights near the shell,
and rings out a warning cry.

493
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,981
"'Oh, that is just my medicine.'

494
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,942
"She says, 'Poisoned?

495
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,153
"'Who could've poisoned it? '

496
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:14,991
"'I promised Wendy to take it and I will,
as soon as I have sharpened my dagger.'

497
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,285
"Tink, who sees its red color

498
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,829
"and remembers the red of the pirate's eye

"nobly swallows the draft

501
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:33,759
"She flutters strangely about the room,
answering him now in a very thin tinkle."

502
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:57,241
"She says she thinks
she could get well again

503
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:59,327
"if children believed in fairies.

504
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,871
"Do you believe in fairies?
Say quick that you believe."

505
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,122
I do! I do! I do!

"'And now to rescue Wendy."'

511
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:28,940
Can you read it to me again?

512
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:33,819
"Peter says..."

513
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,716
He's putting it together now.

514
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,470
- I told you he was smart.
- I'm worried, Elliott.

515
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,222
He could blow up the whole house.

516
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,556
He knows what he's doing.

517
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,226
Listen to how he's breathing.

518
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,478
It's going to work.

519
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,563
What's he feeling now?

520
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,024
He's feeling everything.

521
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,801
Now, you're going as a ghost.
You promised.

522
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:42,763
I'm only pretending
I'm going as a cowgirl.

523
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:46,267
Okay. Now, you know the plans by heart,
don't you?

524
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,019
Meet you at the lookout.

525
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:51,147
At the lookout.
I'm not stupid, you know.

526
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:53,190
Listen, buster.
You won't get four blocks

527
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:54,734
in this neighborhood dressed like that.

528
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,110
- Please.
- No, and that is final.

529
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,695
You are not going as a terrorist.

530
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:58,904
But all the guys are!

531
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,489
I'm not stupid, you know.

532
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,583
Ready?

533
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,043
Ready.

534
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:31,645
- Wait, Mom. Don't look.
- Okay.

535
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,362
Okay, Mom. You can look now.

536
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,069
Oh, that's great!

537
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,455
Stay here.

538
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,553
Stop that! No! Don't!

539
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,266
No. It's a fake knife.
It's a fake.

540
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:10,684
Okay.

541
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:17,817
All right.

542
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:20,986
You look great!

543
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:22,988
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

544
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,198
Thank you.

545
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,793
Be back one hour after sundown.
No later.

546
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:42,800
Bye.

547
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,013
Gertie, come here. Come on.

548
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:19,378
Trick or treat?

549
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,780
Home. Home.

550
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:52,036
Home. Home. Home.
Home. Home. Home.

551
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,333
Be back one hour after sunset.
No later.

552
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,336
I'll try as fast as I can, Mike.

553
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,421
You got to cover me.

554
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,052
Well, come on. Help me.

555
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:11,805
We'll be waiting for you, Elliott.
So come back for sure.

556
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:41,126
It's too bumpy.
We'll have to walk from here!

557
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,295
E.T.!

558
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,309
Not so high! Not so high!

559
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,683
Don't crash, please.

560
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:04,812
I really can't believe you did this.

561
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,529
Your father's going to hear
about this one.

562
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:22,830
Mexico.

563
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,249
E.T., it's working.

564
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,294
It's working!

565
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:53,670
Home.

566
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,548
You did it!

567
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,926
It's working!

568
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,886
Home.

569
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:05,599
E.T., it's working!

570
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,970
Check the door on the left.

571
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,144
We have to go now, E.T.

572
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:53,772
We're so late already.

573
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:03,615
We have to go home now, E.T.

574
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,040
You should give them some time.

575
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:25,971
You could be happy here.

576
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,098
I could take care of you.

577
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:30,309
I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.

578
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,603
We could grow up together, E.T.

579
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,156
Home.

580
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,608
E.T.?

581
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:06,238
E.T.?

582
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,747
How was he dressed when last seen?

583
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,250
He was dressed as a

584
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:20,836
hunchback.

585
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,255
Hunchback.

586
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:26,717
Is there anything to indicate
that he might have run away?

587
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:29,594
Any family problems or recent arguments?

588
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:35,225
My husband and I just separated recently

589
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:39,771
and it hasn't been easy
on the children, but...

590
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:42,441
My father's in Mexico.

591
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,615
But run away, I...

592
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:53,368
Where would he have gone?

593
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:54,870
Elliott.

594
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,705
Oh, Elliott!

595
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:00,459
Don't ever do this again, Elliott!

596
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:04,629
Oh, my. You're so hot.

597
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,175
Run up and draw him a bath.
Quick, Gert.

598
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,178
Sorry I yelled at you.

599
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,975
Thanks very much for all your trouble.

600
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:18,977
Is he here?

601
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,357
- You've got to find him, Mike.
- Where is he?

602
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:27,069
In the forest.

603
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,237
At the bald spot.

604
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,990
You've got to find him.

605
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,209
E.T.!

606
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:32,717
E.T.!

607
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,258
No!

608
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:14,459
No!

609
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,584
Mom, would you come with me?

610
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:49,669
What is it?

611
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:51,504
Mary, just come with me.

612
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:53,465
Michael, what?

613
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:57,010
- Mom, remember the goblin?
- Michael, what are you talking about?

614
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,512
Just swear the most excellent promise
you can make.

615
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:00,972
Michael.

616
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:08,772
That's terrific.

617
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,364
Mom.

618
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:23,995
We're sick.

619
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:28,708
I think we're dying.

620
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,839
- Michael.
- Mom, it's okay.

621
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:37,926
Downstairs.

622
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:40,804
He's not going to hurt you, Mom.

623
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,555
He's not gonna hurt you.

624
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,140
Michael, get her downstairs.

625
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,101
It's the man from the moon.

626
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,812
The man from the moon!

627
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:54,859
You don't know him!
You don't know him!

628
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:01,866
We can't leave him alone.

629
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:42,907
This is my home!

630
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:36,294
Home.

631
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:20,713
<i>The collagen unit,
report to the blue level immediately.</i>

632
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:55,373
Does he sleep at night?

633
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:56,624
I don't know. I don't know.

634
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,334
What's the matter with Elliott?

635
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:02,297
- Have you noticed any surface sweating?
- No.

636
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:05,300
- Has it lost any hair?
- He never had any hair.

637
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:07,260
- Are the children all right?
- Yes.

638
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:10,722
Did it ever build anything
or write anything down?

639
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:11,890
Uh... No.

640
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:15,643
Would you say it has the ability
to manipulate its own environment?

641
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:19,439
He's smart.
He communicates through Elliott.

642
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,192
Elliott thinks its thoughts.

643
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:26,279
No. Elliott feels his feelings.

644
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:33,286
We've identified his primary carrier protein
by electrophoresis.

645
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,537
It's definitely not albumin.

646
01:20:34,622 --> 01:20:37,832
Testing shows no deficit.
Some F&F. HTS test...

647
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,918
EEG analysis shows complete coherence

648
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,670
and synchronization of brainwave activity
between both subjects.

649
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,005
Skin biopsy reveals 9 millimeters of...

650
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,298
<i>Read isotonic.</i>

651
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,009
<i>Nitrates. 255 million equivalent.</i>

652
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,094
Better do IV and oral contrast.

653
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:53,473
If there's no response,
let's move to hypertonic saline.

654
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:55,099
We have meta-starch available.

655
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,559
Cut five per kilo.

656
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:57,727
CVP line could help.

657
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:00,188
I think you get more information
with this one gain.

658
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:06,402
You have no right to do this.
You're scaring him.

659
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,947
You're scaring him!

660
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,240
Respiratory rate, 12.

661
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:12,742
Good air entry but decreased
tidal volume on the boy.

662
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:16,579
Put him on O2 five liters by nasal cannula
and draw blood gas in 20 minutes.

663
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:18,706
Temperature's dropped from 20
to 17 degrees centigrade.

664
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,333
Get a hypothermia blanket...

665
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,460
Please leave him alone.

666
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:26,631
Can you leave him alone?
I can take care of him.

667
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,259
Get a Doppler-scope in here and set me up
for a 2D cardiac echo.

668
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:31,803
Skin is cool and diaphoretic.

669
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,639
He's not refusing at all.
He needs inotropic support.

670
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:38,268
PH is down to 7.03.
He's got metabolic acidosis.

671
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,937
It could be sepsis.

672
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,022
We've drawn two sets of blood cultures.

673
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:46,317
He needs broad-spectrum coverage.
How about amp, gen, flagyl?

674
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:55,493
Elliott.

675
01:21:58,163 --> 01:21:59,998
I've been to the forest.

676
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,875
He shouldn't talk now.

677
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:05,670
Well, he has to talk now, Major.

678
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,302
Elliott, that machine, what does it do?

679
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,472
The communicator?

680
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,019
Is it still working?

681
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:22,854
It's doing something.

682
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:25,607
What?

683
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,610
I really shouldn't tell.

684
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,696
He came to me.

685
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,032
He came to me.

686
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:38,328
Elliott, he came to me, too.

687
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:43,041
I've been wishing for this
since I was 10 years old.

688
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,668
I don't want him to die.

689
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:49,130
What can we do that
we're not already doing?

690
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,884
He needs to go home.

691
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:56,721
He's calling his people

692
01:22:58,349 --> 01:23:00,975
and I don't know where they are.

693
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:04,312
He needs to go home.

694
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:09,442
Elliott, I don't think
that he was left here intentionally.

695
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:15,448
But his being here is a miracle, Elliott.

696
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,076
It's a miracle.

697
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,580
And you did the best
that anybody could do.

698
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,127
I'm glad he met you first.

699
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,681
- He's got DNA.
- Incredible.

700
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:41,933
- He's got DNA.
- What?

701
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,310
He doesn't have four nucleotides like we do.
He has six.

702
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:47,063
I've got de-synchronization
of the two brainwave activities.

703
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,356
What are they?

704
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:51,442
E.T.!

705
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:54,570
The boy's condition is stabilizing.
His blood pressure's coming back up.

706
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,740
E.T.

707
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:00,660
Elliott.

708
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:03,287
- He's speaking.
- He's talking.

709
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:06,874
E.T., stay with me.

710
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,336
Please.

711
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:12,171
Stay.

712
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:13,548
Together.

713
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:17,135
I'll be right here.

714
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:19,804
I'll be right here.

715
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,726
Stay.

716
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:28,896
Elliott.

717
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:43,619
Stay.

718
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:46,998
The creature's pressure is bottoming out.
His complexes are slow and widening.

719
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,958
How's the boy?

720
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:52,170
He's converting back to normal
sinus rhythm.

721
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:55,173
- They're separating.
- Yes, definitely separating.

722
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:56,674
Boy and creature are separating.

723
01:24:56,717 --> 01:25:00,386
- What does that mean?
- The boy's coming back. We're losing E.T.

724
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:03,473
E.T., answer me, please.

725
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:06,309
- Everything is going to be fine.
- Please.

726
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,269
Just relax.

727
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:16,921
No!

728
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,714
E.T., don't go!

729
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:21,592
- No blood pressure.
- He's got no pulse or respiration.

730
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:25,763
We can't get a pulse or blood pressure
on the creature.

731
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:27,723
It doesn't look like he's breathing.

732
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:35,022
Leave him alone!
You're killing him!

733
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,607
Leave him alone!

734
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:38,484
Let's move it!

735
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:40,653
Get the boy out of here.
Get him away.

736
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:44,532
Stop it! You're killing him!
You're killing him!

737
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:49,829
You're killing him!
You're killing him!

738
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,582
You're killing him!
He came to me!

739
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,626
Any pulses? Any pulses?

740
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:57,378
- Okay, let's go.
- He came to me!

741
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,844
Minimal breath sounds.

742
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:08,931
Calm down. Calm down. Calm...

743
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:14,020
Let's try some bretylium.
Can we have some bretylium, please?

744
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:16,689
Getting a pulse?

745
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:18,983
Compressed air.
Compressed air's fine.

746
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:21,027
Thank you.

747
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:22,778
All IV push.

748
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,113
He's not ventilating.

749
01:27:25,324 --> 01:27:27,241
His pupils are fixed and dilated.

750
01:27:27,326 --> 01:27:28,367
How about some more drugs?

751
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:29,493
Quiet.

752
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,245
Defibrillate him.

753
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:37,293
- Everybody, stand clear.
- Clear.

754
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,128
We're losing him.

755
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:40,421
One more time.

756
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:43,841
Quiet.

757
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:45,843
- It's still v-fib.
- Okay, let's go.

758
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:47,345
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

759
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,182
Quiet.

760
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,270
Elliott?

761
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,190
Mom.

762
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:10,952
Try calcium.

763
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,954
He needs some calcium in his body.

764
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:14,664
Let's continue CPR, please.

765
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:32,223
Would you people stand back?

766
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:39,355
Something's happening.

767
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,483
- Oh, they're going to die.
- Shut up, Greg.

768
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,610
Something is definitely happening.

769
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:46,946
- Anybody have any ideas?
- EKG's flat.

770
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,615
- EKG's flat.
- Okay, I'm going to call it.

771
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,327
- I think he's dead.
- No. I don't know.

772
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:55,496
All right. I'm calling it.
What time do you have?

773
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,747
1536.

774
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:59,166
15 hours, 36 minutes.

775
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:01,252
Okay.

776
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,754
Let's pack him in ice.

777
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:06,257
Let's leave.

778
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:14,283
Is he dead, Mama?

779
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:17,161
I think so, sweetheart.

780
01:30:17,788 --> 01:30:19,997
Can we wish for him to come back?

781
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,042
Yeah.

782
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:25,044
I wish.

783
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:27,505
I wish, too.

784
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:40,518
Come on, Gert.
We'll wait for Elliott in the front room.

785
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:47,566
Cardiac arrest was terminated
at 1500 hours and 36 minutes.

786
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:53,280
He received intravenous lidocaine,
intravenous epinephrine, a lidocaine drip,

787
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:57,701
2.7% sodium-chloride solution,
catheters from the "A" line.

788
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:02,248
And the intravenous line
should be sent for culture.

789
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:08,295
He was monitored with
an EEG and an EKG.

790
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,214
He was defibrillated...

791
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:12,550
They're going to have
to take him away now.

792
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:15,010
They're just gonna cut him all up.

793
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:20,641
Would you like to spend some time
alone with him?

794
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:38,909
Could we all step out for a minute, please?

795
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:35,716
Look at what they've done to you.

796
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:40,054
I'm so sorry.

797
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:47,895
You must be dead

798
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:54,318
because I don't know how to feel.

799
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,241
I can't feel anything anymore.

800
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,829
You've gone someplace else now.

801
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,507
I'll believe in you all my life.

802
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:19,760
Every day.

803
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:25,891
E.T.,

804
01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:30,604
I love you.

805
01:34:02,095 --> 01:34:03,846
Oh, my God.

806
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:12,688
E.T. phone home.

807
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:16,191
Home. Phone home.

808
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:18,152
Phone home.

809
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:20,237
Does this mean they're coming?

810
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:22,114
Yes.

811
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:27,828
E.T. phone home.
E.T. phone home.

812
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:29,288
Stay.

813
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:31,165
Shut up.

814
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:32,458
Phone.

815
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:33,834
- Phone home.
- Quiet!

816
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:35,669
Phone! Phone! Phone!

817
01:34:35,754 --> 01:34:37,755
Would you shut up?

818
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:40,215
Phone home. E.T. phone home.

819
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,010
E.T. phone home.
E.T. phone home.

820
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:44,762
E.T. phone home.

821
01:34:44,888 --> 01:34:46,180
Phone home.

822
01:34:46,264 --> 01:34:48,474
Phone home. Elliott.

823
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:51,352
Elliott. Elliott. Elliott.

824
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:55,981
Elliott?

825
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:07,117
- Elliott?
- No.

826
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:11,705
- Elliott, why don't you come with me?
- No. No.

827
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:14,958
- It's all right.
- No, no.

828
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:19,922
It'll be all right.

829
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:22,841
Would you like the flowers?

830
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:30,057
He's alive! He's alive!

831
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:45,823
Are they gone, Mama?

832
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:48,492
- Who's gone, honey?
- The boys.

833
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:49,743
What boys?

834
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:53,664
I'm supposed to give you this note
when they're gone.

835
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:57,376
Give it to me now, Gertie.

836
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:06,677
Oh, my God.

837
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,563
Give me a hand with this.

838
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,781
- Where's your mask?
- It's back here.

839
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:29,783
- Well, get it on!
- I'm trying!

840
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:38,584
Hey, who are you?

841
01:36:39,294 --> 01:36:40,919
I'm driving.

842
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:44,006
Open the door, son.

843
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:46,091
There's a guy out here.
What do I do?

844
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:48,385
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

845
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,305
Well, let's get out of here, Michael!

846
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:54,224
I've never driven forward before!

847
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:05,986
Get the bikes. Meet us at the playground
at the top of the hill.

848
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:07,321
Let's do it!

849
01:37:09,115 --> 01:37:12,242
Come on, Michael!
Go, go, go!

850
01:37:27,926 --> 01:37:30,761
We're all gonna die,
and they're never gonna give me my license.

851
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:37,684
- Where's the playground?
- It's near the preschool!

852
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:42,105
- Where's that?
- I don't know streets. Mom always drives me.

853
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,358
Son of a bitch.

854
01:38:10,343 --> 01:38:13,554
- Where are you going?
- To the spaceship.

855
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:17,266
- Spaceship?
- To the spaceship to the moon.

856
01:38:17,684 --> 01:38:19,142
Quiet!

857
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:22,062
Oh, my God.

858
01:38:23,022 --> 01:38:24,731
Stop the van!

859
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:30,279
Don't pull them off!

860
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:45,335
That did it!

861
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:38,055
Okay. He's a man from outer space
and we're taking him to his spaceship.

862
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:40,891
Well, can't he just beam up?

863
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:42,809
This is reality, Greg.

864
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:46,772
- Keep her back!
- No!

865
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:50,734
- Hold her back!
- No guns! They're children!

866
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:53,570
 No! No! No!

867
01:39:53,655 --> 01:39:54,988
- Where are they?
- No!

868
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:57,115
There's nobody here.

869
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:06,166
Where are we going?

870
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:07,626
To the forest!

871
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:12,214
Follow me!

872
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:46,623
We got them,
at the bottom of the hill.

873
01:41:02,849 --> 01:41:04,433
This is Unit 302.

874
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:07,853
We've cut the kids off at the bottom of the hill.
Send backup units.

875
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:34,045
Let's split up.

876
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:35,338
Okay!

877
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:45,348
Hang on!

878
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:08,538
We made it! Oh, shit!

879
01:42:48,538 --> 01:42:50,455
Tell me when it's over!

880
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:04,738
Home.

881
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:54,329
Stop the car, Mama!

882
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:57,332
They're over there!
They're over there!

883
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:16,184
I just wanted to say goodbye.

884
01:45:17,895 --> 01:45:19,729
He doesn't know goodbye.

885
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:24,234
Be good.

886
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:26,987
Yes.

887
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:57,976
Thank you.

888
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,062
You're welcome.

889
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:28,798
Come.

890
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:34,888
Stay.

891
01:48:06,438 --> 01:48:11,442
I'll be right here.

892
01:48:21,412 --> 01:48:22,495
Bye.
