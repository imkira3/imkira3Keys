NARRATOR: This is a story
of an ordinary little boy...

3
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,137
...named Charlie Bucket.

4
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:28,351
He was not faster or stronger
or more clever than other children.

5
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:35,107
His family was not rich
or powerful or well-connected.

6
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,070
In fact, they barely had enough to eat.

7
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,533
Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy
in the entire world.

8
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,078
He just didn't know it yet.

9
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,680
-Evening, Buckets.
-Evening.

00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,306
CHARLlE:
Hi, Dad.

11
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,644
Soup's almost ready, darling.

12
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,481
Don't suppose there's anything
extra to put in, love.

13
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,943
Oh, well. Nothing goes better
with cabbage than cabbage.

14
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,949
Charlie...

15
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,868
...l found something l think you'll like.

16
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:35,376
NARRATOR: Charlie's father worked
at the local toothpaste factory.

17
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:39,588
The hours were long,
and the pay was terrible...

18
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:44,593
...yet occasionally,
there were unexpected surprises.

19
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,597
It's exactly what l need.

20
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,225
What is it, Charlie?

21
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,775
Dad found it, just the piece I needed.

22
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,945
-What piece was it?
-A head for Willy Wonka.

23
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,363
Well, how wonderful.

24
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,574
It's quite a likeness.

25
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,409
CHARLlE: You think so?
-Think so?

26
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,161
I know so.

27
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,998
I saw Willy Wonka
with my own two eyes.

28
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,459
-l used to work for him, you know.
-You did?

29
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,169
-l did.
-He did.

30
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,628
He did.

31
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,797
I love grapes.

32
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:26,343
Of course, I was a much
younger man in those days.

33
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:32,391
GRANDPA JOE: Willy Wonka began with
a single store on Cherry Street.

34
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,853
But the whole world wanted his candy.

35
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,567
-Mr. Wonka.
-Yeah?

36
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,527
We need more Wonka bars...

37
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,531
-...and we're out of chocolate birds.
-Birds?

38
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,158
Birds.

39
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:53,370
Well, then we'll need
to make some more. Here.

40
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,708
Now open.

41
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,086

[TlTTERS]

43
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,964
The man was a genius.

44
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,803
Did you know he invented a new way
of making chocolate ice cream...

45
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,640
...so that it stays cold for hours
without a freezer?

46
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:17,311
You can even leave it lying in the sun
on a hot day, and it won't go runny.

47
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,357
-But that's impossible.
-But Willy Wonka did it.

48
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,736
GRANDPA JOE:
Before long...

49
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,448
...he decided to build
a proper chocolate factory.

50
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,701
The largest chocolate factory
in history.

51
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,163
Fifty times as big as any other.

52
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,851
Grandpa, don't make it gross.

53
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,730
Tell him about the lndian prince.
He'd like to hear about that.

54
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,567
You mean, Prince Pondicherry?

55
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:09,530
Well, Prince Pondicherry
wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka...

56
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,408
...and asked him to come
all the way out to India...

57
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:17,204
...and build him a colossal palace
entirely out of chocolate.

58
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,540
[LAUGHS]

59
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,876
WONKA:
It will have 1 00 rooms...

60
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,672
...and everything will be made
of dark or light chocolate.

61
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,137
GRANDPA JOE: True to his word,
the bricks were chocolate...

62
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,056
...and the cement holding
them together was chocolate.

63
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,102
All the walls and ceilings
were made of chocolate as well.

64
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,857
So were the carpets
and the pictures and the furniture.

65
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,943
It is perfect in every way.

66
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,238
Yeah, but it won't last long.
You better start eating right now.

67
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:55,201
Oh, nonsense. I will not eat my palace.

68
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,704
I intend to live in it.

69
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,959
But Mr. Wonka was right, of course.

70
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:09,798
Soon after this, there came
a very hot day with a boiling sun.

71
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,052
Mmm.

72
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,685
[LAUGHS]

73
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:50,714
The prince sent an urgent telegram
requesting a new palace...

74
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,676
...but Willy Wonka was facing
problems of his own.

75
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,557
All the other chocolate makers, you see,
had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka.

76
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:05,521
They began sending in spies
to steal his secret recipes.

77
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,386
Fickelgruber started making
an ice cream that would never melt.

78
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:41,932
Prodnose came out with a chewing gum
that never lost its flavor.

79
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,893
Then Slugworth
began making candy balloons...

80
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,063
...that you could blow up
to incredible sizes.

81
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,191
The thievery got so bad...

82
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,527
...that one day, without warning...

83
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:58,240
...Mr. Wonka told every single one
of his workers to go home.

84
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:03,245
He announced that he was closing
his chocolate factory forever.

85
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,624
I'm closing my chocolate factory
forever.

86
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,084
I'm sorry.

87
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,812
But it didn't close forever.
It's open right now.

88
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,233
Ah, yes, sometimes when grownups say
"forever," they mean "a very long time."

89
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:37,112
Such as, "l feel like l've eaten
nothing but cabbage soup forever."

90
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,949
-Now, Pops.
-The factory did close, Charlie.

91
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,120
And it seemed like it was
going to be closed forever.

92
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:49,958
Then one day we saw smoke
rising from the chimneys.

93
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:54,004
-The factory was back in business.
-Did you get your job back?

94
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,298
No.

95
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,300
No one did.

96
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,597
But there must be
people working there.

97
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,309
Think about it, Charlie.
Have you ever seen a single person...

98
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,145
...going into that factory
or coming out of it?

99
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,525
No. The gates are always closed.

100
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,360
Exactly.

101
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,029
But then, who's running the machines?

102
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,157
-Nobody knows, Charlie.
-lt certainly is a mystery.

103
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,660
Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka?

104
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,373
Nobody sees him anymore.
He never comes out.

105
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:34,461
The only thing that comes
out of that place is the candy...

106
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,172
...already packed and addressed.

107
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,761
I'd give anything in the world
just to go in one more time...

108
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:47,015
...and see what's become
of that amazing factory.

109
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,562
Well, you won't, because you can't.
No one can.

110
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,691
It's a mystery,
and it will always be a mystery.

111
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:00,654
That little factory of yours, Charlie, is as
close as any of us is ever going to get.

112
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,034
Come on, Charlie. I think it's time
we let your grandparents get some sleep.

...underneath the ordinary wrapping
paper of five ordinary Wonka bars.

...and find a golden ticket inside?

So imagine, you're sitting at home
watching television...

950
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:21,003
...and suddenly a commercial will flash
onto the screen, and a voice will say:

951
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:25,257
"Wonka's chocolates
are the best in the world.

952
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:28,344
If you don't believe us,
try one for yourself."

So can you send other things?

Say, like, breakfast cereal?

957
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:42,149
Do you have any idea
what breakfast cereal's made of?

958
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,653
It's those little curly wooden shavings
you find in pencil sharpeners.

959
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,947
But could you send it by TV
if you wanted to?

960
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,241
-Of course l could.
-What about people?

961
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:54,120
Well, why would I wanna send a person?
They don't taste very good at all.

962
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:57,498

Well, sometimes only half of
the little pieces find their way through.

If you had to choose only one half
of your son, which one would it be?
