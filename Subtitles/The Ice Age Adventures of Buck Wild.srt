00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,285
I just lift my leg and do it.
That tree is mine, for instance.

157
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,203
And that tree, and that one.

158
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,874
[Eddie] And that rock over there.
And your pillow too!

159
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,796
[snoring]

160
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,632
[yawns]

161
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,220
Go sleep over there.

162
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,931
And turn on your side
so you don't keep me up snoring all night.

163
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,350
I... I don't snore.

164
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,394
Trust me,
you blow that face tuba all night long.

165
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:26,274
Yeah, oh... Okay, look, I'm sorry
about what I said to Crash and Eddie.

166
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,527
It's just... Well, family can be difficult.

167
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,865
We are a nutty, mixed-up herd
full of loners and outcasts.

168
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,493
And that's just on my side.

169
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,788
Right, and you don't hear me
complain about your side ever.

170
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,915
My side takes care of themselves.

171
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,834
Yeah, well, Diego does.

172
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,338
And then we both take care of Sid.

173
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,342
Nah, don't you gotta...
You've gotta save some for later though.

174
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,095
Well, possum families
just aren't like that.

175
00:09:55,178 --> 00:10:00,642
Yeah, you know, you could let them
face consequences sometimes. Just saying.

176
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,896
How? By kicking them out?
You know they can't survive on their own.

177
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,606
Mmm. Interesting.

178
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,776
Well, maybe what scares you
is that they won't need you anymore.

179
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,114
Or maybe it's the fact that their
only natural defense is to play dead.

180
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,324
They're my brothers.

181
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,077
They're the only family I had before you.

182
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,204
They saved my life, Manny.

183

200
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,333
Well, Sis, I guess
you're the head possum of the family now.

[sighs]

202
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,144
You know, I lost my mama too.

203
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,981
Well, technically, she moved away
without leaving a forwarding address.

204
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,441
But then I found Manny here.

205
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,152
And then, when Diego came along
and tried to kill us,

206
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,279
we knew we were destined to be a family.

207
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,241
Sid, don't you have somewhere else
to sleep?

208
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,701
Don't you?

We can't just leave
without saying goodbye.

216
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,939
Goodbye, Sis.
It's time for us to make our own destiny.

217
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,317
And maybe even make our own lunch.

218
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,569
We may never see you again.

Did you hear that?

00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,945
Huh? Wha... I... I don't hear anything.

225
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,949
Right. It's too quiet.
Nothing's breaking. No one's fighting.

226
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,826
That can only mean one thing.

227
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,829
They're gone. They took all their things.

228
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,455
They don't have any things.

229
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,540
[Ellie] Exactly.

230
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,251
Uh-oh. This is not gonna go well for you.

231
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,755
Manny, my brothers are out there
in the wild, and it's all your fault.

232
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:41,840
What, my fault?

233
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,427
Well, you did challenge them
to try to survive on their own.

234
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,595
In effect, sending them to their doom.

235
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,763
[Manny] Thanks, Sid.

236
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,391
Anytime, buddy. I always got your back.

237
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,600
Don't worry, honey.

238
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:56,521
If... If Crash and Eddie get into trouble,
they'll find their way back.

239
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,814
Find their way back?

240
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,066
The only thing worse
than their survival skills

241
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,526
is their sense of direction.

242
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,737
Mmm. And their math skills
aren't great either.

243
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,405
Come on. We've got to find them.

244
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:13,830
[Sid] They also have zero musical talent.
And they're awful at bird calls.

[Crash and Eddie laughing]

Dude, being on our own totally rules!

247
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,967
And we've got nothing to worry about
since we've got nine lives.

248
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:29,054
- Oh, come on. Everyone knows that's dogs.
- Oh.

249
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,764
Well, how many lives do we get?

250
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,682
I forget. It's either four or eleven.

251
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,185
[grunting]

252
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,272

[Crash] Destiny hurts.

256
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,495
[Eddie] Have we been here before?

257
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,164
[Crash] It does look kinda familiar.

258
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,125
Wait. Is this the way to the Lost World?

259
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,462
It's the most exciting place
we've ever been!

260
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,341
It's also the most dangerous.
Do you think we can find it?

261
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,010
With our keen sense of direction? [laughs]

262
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,639
Puh-lease. To the Lost World!

263
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,059
[Crash] Dead end!

264
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,269
[Eddie] To the Lost World!

[sighs] It's hopeless.
We'll never find it.

267
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,499
[Crash] Found it!

268
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,171
[Eddie] Ooh.

269
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,092
Ellie told us never,
ever to go back in there.

270
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,602
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

271
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,773
- To the Lost World!
- To the Lost World!

You've gotta brush more.

[both scream]

284
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,616
[Crash] One of us should give ourselves up
so the other can get away!

285
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,743
[Eddie] Good idea! I volunteer you!

[gasps] Crash,
it's just like I remembered it!

289
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,766
It always amazes me
there's a whole world down here.

290
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,142
Right below our feet.

291
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,645
And a giant spider right above our heads.

We're gonna be goners!

296
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,206
Yeah! And then
we'll only have three or ten more lives!

[screams]

298
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,751
[Crash] You know that whole
"living on our own" thing?

299
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,212
- [Eddie] Yeah?
- I'm starting to question our judgment!

300
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,756
Well, this is the perfect time to do it.

Hello, boys!

- Buck!
- Buck?

308
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,994
That's right! Buck Wild, at your service.

309
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,412
Our hero!

310
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,831
The legend of the Lost World!

311
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,458
The wizard of weasels!

312
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,043
The yin to my yang!

313
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,920
Your ways are strange
and mysterious, Buck,

314
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,213
but mostly strange.

315
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,506
Thanks for dropping in.

316
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,468
Will the rest of the herd
be falling from the sky too?

317
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,179
I don't think I can catch the mammoths.
One, maybe.

318
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:40,847
[all groan]

319
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,433
[Buck] Mayday! Mayday!
We're coming in hot!

320
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,021
- Whoa!
- [snarls]

321
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,397
[groans]

322
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,941
[Buck] This is your captain speaking.

323
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,987
Please keep your whiskers and bottoms
inside the dactyl at all times.

324
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,614
Whoo-hoo!

325
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,199
- [chitters]
- [snarls]

326
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,367
[both gasp]

327
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,121
- Buck!
- Crack!

328
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,546
[Buck laughs]

329
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:18,009
You picked a bad time
for a tropical vacation, lads.

330
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,096
A dino named Orson
just escaped from exile.

331
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,224
And he's jonesing to rule the Lost World.

332
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,017
Now he's got a couple of raptors.

333
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,479
And if he succeeds,
no mammal will be safe.

334
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,065
Whoa! Well, it's a good thing
I'm not a mammal.

335
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,900
- You are a mammal.
- Sorry, bro.

336
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,985
Looks like life dealt you a bad hand.

337
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,153
You're a mammal too.

338
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,321
That's impossible.

339
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,949
What are the odds of two possums
being mammals?

340
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:44,911
Well, they're the same odds
that you'll both be a raptor's brunch

341
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,788
if I don't get you out of here.

342
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,249
[pterodactyl chirps, squawks]

343
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,214
Got to feed Penelope.

344
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,927
She needs gas,
and these berries will give it to her.

345
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,305
Back off, Brenda. They're friends of mine.

346
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,433
- [muffled groaning]
- [Buck] Brenda.

347
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,893
Spit.

348
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,063
Spit.

349
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,024
[muffled screaming]

350
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,235
So far, best day ever!

351
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,155
Now, tell me, what brings you two
to my world?

352
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,322
We moved out.

353
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,700
Yeah, we're mature now.

354
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,076
Really?

355
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,829
Well, at first, Ellie was all…
[imitates Ellie] "Yada yada yada."

356
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,373
And then Manny was like…
[imitates Manny] "Blah, blah, blah."

357
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,459
Yeah, that does sound like him.

358
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,961
And Diego was all... [growling]

359
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,421
I mean, you know how he is.

360
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,590
And then Ellie said, "I don't like it,

361
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,217
but I suppose it's time.
Good luck out there."

362
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,804
Then she hugged us, Sid scratched himself,
and bingo bongo in the Congo, we're here!

363
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,891
You're telling me Ellie
gave her okey dokey

364
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,226
to this little artichokey
of a mission here?

365
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,811
Oh, yeah. Totally.

366
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,104
- [gasps]
- Hmm?

367
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,273
Okay, okay. We snuck out.

368
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,649
Ow!

369
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,234
You try to survive that look.

370
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,613
[gulps]

371
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:05,075
I admit it! Whatever it is! [panting]

372
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,369
I've got to take you back home, fellas.

373
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,454
I'm the only one that can stop Orson,

374
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,707
but I won't be able to do that
if I have you two to look after.

375
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,125
But-but-but-but, Buck,

376
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,796
we came here to live a life
of adventure, like you.

377
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,548
You boys are nature's least likely
to survive.

378
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,259
And this is its most dangerous place.

379
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,762
Wow. Talk about a perfect match.

380
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,523
I'll be back in a minute, girl.

381
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,275
[Crash] Buck, don't send us back.

382
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,820
[Eddie] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We wanna hang here with you.

383
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,446
[Crash] Please. We're independent.

384
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,781
Both of us.

385
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:45,907
Together.

386
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,828
This boulder's not supposed to be here.
How did it get here?

387
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,705
[Orson] Hmm… How do you think?

388
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,956
Well, how should I know?

389
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,335
[Orson] Unbelievable.
Your cluelessness is truly breathtaking.

390
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,171
Don't you take that tone with me, Rocky.

391
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:02,632
Now I insist you roll away at once.

392
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,635
Uh, I don't think
it's the boulder talking.

393
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,513
Well, not anymore.
I obviously intimidated him.

394
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,933
Seems like Mr. Boulder here
is all growl and no gravel.

395
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,561
Wow. Okay, enough. [laughs]

396
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,146
I can't do this anymore.

397
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,149
Hey, I'm over here,
you soon-to-be ex-weasel.

398
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,569
Look at me.
Look at me with your dumb little eye.

399
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:25,655
Orson.

400
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,324
Buck.

401
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,534
Eddie.

402
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,995
Crash.

403
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,789
I heard you'd returned. But how?

404
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,334
Nobody escapes from Lava Island.

405
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,545
Well, not everyone
has my colossal intellect.

406
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:44,341
Which is dwarfed only by your ego
and insecurity.

407
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,343
Why'd you seal the exit, Orson?

408
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,888
Oh, no reason. Just to keep
filthy animals like you

409
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:55,101
from coming in and infecting our ecosystem
with your fur and warm blood.

410
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,520
Lost World for lost species!

411
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,190
Dinos rule… [chuckles] …mammals drool.

412
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:02,233
It's true. You do.

413
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,153
Wait a minute. Dinos don't talk.

414
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,614
They just grunt and roar like nincompoops.

415
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,450
That's good. Hey, that's funny.
That's really funny.

416
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,327
Dinos have tiny brains.

417
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,496
Like I haven't heard that a million times.

418
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,332
Does this brain look tiny to you?

419
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,626
Holy moly, that's huge!

420
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,795
Seriously. That thing's a planet.

421
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,881
I'm surprised there isn't
a little moon going around it. [laughs]

422
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,468
That kind of reaction used to hurt.
I thought I was a freak.

423
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:33,807
Then I realized that my massive brain
made me the smartest creature alive!

424
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,560
But you know the best part?
The joke's on you.

425
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:40,397
My brain, the thing
that everyone ridiculed,

426
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,274
is the one thing
that's gonna get me my revenge.

427
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,277
I'll rule everyone under the ice!

428
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,573
Not even you can stop me this time,
Buckmeinster.

429
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:52,992
[gasps]

430
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,619
It's Buckminster.

431
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,204
[screams]

432
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,540
Though most call me Buck.

433
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:00,834
"Buckmeinster" is not even a name.

434
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,754
That's like me calling you "Shmorson."

435
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:09,676
Whatever, Bucky. Now that I've got
some muscle behind me,

436
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,429
it's a whole new ball game.

437
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,432
[gasps] There's gonna be a ball game?

438
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,351
[groans] Check it out.

439
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,687
[gasps, screams]

440
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,022
[both groan]

441
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,775
[scoffs]
Well, look. They've gone and died.

442
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,028
No one wants to eat dead possums.

443
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,655
It's too chewy.
It's like eating hairy gum.

444
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:31,740
Okay.

445
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,408
I can totally see you're breathing.

446
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:36,786
[Orson] Look, look... Right there.
Look, even these morons can see it.

447
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,124
Time for a possum picnic!

448
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,418
Oh!

449
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,548
Oh!

450
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:53,345
Until our next tango, <i>mi iguana gigante</i>.

451
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,565
No one outsmarts Orson!

452
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,902
Now, we're gonna have to play
a little game called

453
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,029
"drop goes the weasel."

454
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:14,157
It means, take down Buck!

455
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,494
[shouts] Oh, my... Geez.

456
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:20,038
What did I say about boundaries, huh?

457
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,999
And you! Stop copying me!

458
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:36,012
It's not safe here, girl.
Better take off for the night.

459
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,222
[chitters]

460
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,432
Be careful.

461
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,892
[squawks]

462
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,105
Where to next, Buck?

463
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,107
We're already here.

464
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,483
- [thuds]
- [both scream]

465
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,568
[screaming continues]

466
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,990
[camera shutter clicking]

467
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,039
- [thudding]
- [Eddie grunts]

468
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,592
Buck's bachelor den!

469
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,637
Wow.

470
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,016
Talk about a possum paradise.

471
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,436
Hang on.
Gotta pay the cucumber for babysitting.

472
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:29,357
Crash, wouldn't it be awesome
if we could live here with Buck?

473
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,067
Look, I know I said
it was gonna be three hours,

474
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,235
but it was only two, and...

475
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,113
I'm not gonna pay for an hour
where you didn't do anything.

476
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,699
- He's got everything.
- [Buck] I'll pay you for three.

477
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,868
You drive a hard bargain
for a salad pincher.

478
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:42,704
Right, I just hope you didn't spend
the whole time talking to your boyfriend.

479
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,081
[both yelp]

480
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:46,666
You remember my daughter?

481
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,126
Bronwyn!

482
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:52,964
She's gotten so big and round, and big.

483
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,549
These are your uncle possums.

484
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,802
She doesn't remember you
because she was so young.

485
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,304
And also 'cause she's a squash.

486
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:03,808
Buck, I know you like living alone here
with your farm-fresh daughter,

487
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,770
but wouldn't it be nice
to have a couple of roommates?

488
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,313
Free pumpkin care.

489
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,106
And we charge less than cucumbers.

490
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,777
Sorry, boys. I'm a solo operator
who can't be tied down.

491
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,321
You can stay until I've stopped Orson,
but after that,

492
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:19,074
I'm gonna find a way to get you back home.

493
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,701
Well, maybe we could help you stop Orson.

494
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,536
Dude, up top!

495
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,872
[hollow thud, clatters, bounces]

Crash!

500
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:37,926
Eddie!

501
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:42,514
I don't mean to be a negative Nancy,
but they've been gone a while.

502
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:45,600
Shouldn't we just be
looking for bones at this point?

503
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:49,646
I respectfully withdraw the question.

504
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,272
Hey, Über-tracker,

505
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:52,941
- you picked up that scent yet?
- [Diego sniffs]

506
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:56,861
Aside from you,
nothing smells bad. So, no.

507
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:02,200
Manny, they're out there all alone
in the cold. They're probably frightened.

508
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,994
Look, don't worry. We'll find them.

509
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:08,248
Because if we don't find them,
I'm gonna kill them.

510
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:09,332
[grunts]

511
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,627
It's a figure of speech. And ow!

512
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,968
Ha, ha, ha!

513
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:22,637
[imitating Buck]
You've got nowhere to run, Orson!

514
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,307
Or should I say Shmorson.

515
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:27,392
[gasps]

516
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:28,601

- [grunts]
- [objects clattering]

519
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:37,027
So, how are you gonna defeat
this Shmorson dude anyway?

520
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,862
That is a good question, Crash.

521
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:41,281
- I'm Eddie, the handsome one.
- Right.

522
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,575
Back in the day,
Orson was tough on his own.

523
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:45,493
But now he's got some trained raptors,

524
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,580
taking him down
is gonna be a little bit trickier.

525
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:50,248
Why is he such a meanie anyway?

526
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,708
Another good question, Eddie.

527
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,585
I'm Crash, the other handsome one.

528
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:58,048
When he was young, Orson was teased
and got all insecure about his big head.

529
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,425
The bigger his head grew,
so too did his brain.

530
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:03,428
And he realized
that this was his greatest strength.

531
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:07,349
But he came to believe
he was superior to everyone else.

532
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,309
I tried to show him we were all equals.

533
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:12,354
I even invited him to be part of
this team I belonged to.

534
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,691
[Buck] <i>We established the watering hole</i>
<i>as a place</i>

00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,954
Whoa!

540
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,207
Like a superhero squad?

541
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,543
Well, I wouldn't use the term "superhero."

542
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:38,588
I mean, I wouldn't stop you
from using it. Anyway.

- <i>Orson believed in a world…</i>
- [all scream]

But at great cost.

557
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,729
To keep the Lost World safe,
we banished Orson

558

- to a place called Lava Island.

634
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:08,650
[sniffs] Oh, yeah. Gas.

635
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:09,776
[both] Yours?

636
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,737
[echoing] Zee.

637
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:17,325
[ringing]

638
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,539
[Crash, distorted] Buck.

639
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,332
[Eddie, distorted] Buck?

640
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,583
- Buck?
- [thud]

641
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,377
- [groans]
- Buck?

642
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,795
[evil laughs]

643
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:31,256
[yells] The possums! The possums!

644
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:33,341
Gas don't faze us, dude.

645
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,968
We're used to things that stink.

646
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,845
[sighs]

647
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,054
[gasps]

648
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,473
[Zee] Looking for this?

649
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,526
Wow.

650
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:53,862
Zee, is that you?

651
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:56,489
Well, someone had to save your butt.

652
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,658
[squeals, grunts]

653
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:01,828
So I picked me.

654
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,663
Wait. What about Bronwyn?

655
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,999
She's safe. I left her with the cucumber.

656
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:08,710
Good. The cucumber knows karate.

657
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:12,922
Dude. Psst. You know Bronwyn's, like,
a pumpkin, right?

658
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:16,051
Yeah. I also know Buck's got a cousin
who's a pine cone.

659
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:17,552
Oh, right. Philip.

660
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,263
Buck, who's your awesome skunk friend?

661
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:23,391
I'm not a skunk, guys. I'm a zorilla.

662
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:24,934
What's the difference?

663
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:28,563
The difference is
[shouting] I'm a mammal on a mission

664
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:32,025
to bring equality
and justice to the Lost World.

665
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:35,278
[normal voice]
Also, skunks have slightly shorter tails.

666
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:36,780
She's totally a skunk.

667
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:39,491
A skunk with a secret identity!

668
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:41,201
Cool.

669
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,745
Well... I... Okay, yeah.

670
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:46,873
- If that'll get you going, great.
- [dinosaurs roar]

671
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:48,958
Come on, those boneheads are waking up.

672
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,502
[Eddie] We'll follow you anywhere.

673
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:53,380
[Crash] Off a cliff, underwater,
into a volcano.

674
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:57,884
I like your new friends.

675
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,594
- [yelps]
- [laughs]

676
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:01,096
They make me feel smart.

677
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,931
Don't worry.
What they lack in intelligence,

678
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:05,433
they make up for in bumbling ineptitude.

679
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:09,145
Buck, we have some unfinished business
to take care of.

680
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:13,400
[scoffs] I mean, you know. Look. I know
we didn't always see eye to eye.

681
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:15,944
Or, in my case, eyes to eye.

682
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:21,199
Relax. I'm only here for one reason,
and it's bigger than you and me.

683
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:27,163
If we don't stop Orson, he'll destroy
the harmony we fought so hard for.

684
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:30,875
With him in charge,
the Lost World will be, well…

685
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:33,461
lost.

686
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:34,921
Oh.

687
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:36,631
Right.

688
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:40,135
And because then it will be
the "Lost Lost World,"

689
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:42,345
which is both sad and confusing.

690
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:45,056
[as Lefty]
Is the team getting back together again?

691
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,474
You stay out of it, you!

692
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:48,226
I thought you two stopped talking.

693
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,936
[as Lefty] We patched things up.

694
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,981
And no, Lefty.
The team's not getting back together.

695
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,859
Once we stop Orson, I'm outta here.

696
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:57,610
That's a secret skunk for ya.

697
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,821
They never stay in one place too long.

698
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:02,032
[Eddie]
Of course that glorious scent lingers.

699
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:06,953
[clattering]

700
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:16,755
Hmm. No, no, no. My head's not that big.
This is not to scale at all.

701
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:17,839
[imitating Orson]

702
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:20,258
- I know you're there.
- [imitating Orson] I know you're there.

703
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,719
- What have I said about copying, huh?
- [continues imitating]

704
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:26,014
Uh-uh-uh. Don't... Don't...
Don't you... Don't you dare.

705
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:29,100
- Stop copying me!
- [crash, clattering]

706
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:30,310
[growls]

707
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,772
- Oh, I should have worked with birds.
- [grunts, vocalizes]

708
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:35,148
Huh?

709
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:39,778
Huh.

710
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:42,697
Clearly you two aren't nearly enough
to get the job done.

711
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,534
Time to add to my posse.

712
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:48,203
What I'm about to do next

713
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:51,706
will destroy everything you've worked for,
Buckmeinster.

714
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,792
[purring]

715
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,710
- Get out of my face!
- [snarls]

716
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,214
How'd you know those raptors
were gonna attack?

717
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:01,716
Unfortunately, Orson's been tracking you.

718
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,052
Fortunately, I've been tracking Orson.

719
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:05,845
[birds chirp]

720
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,640
Then, I guess it's up to you guys
to stop 'em.

721
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:11,101
Two superheroes joining forces again!

722
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:13,770
Buck Wild and Skunk-a-tor!

723
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,314
I can't believe you told them
we were superheroes.

724
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:19,359
I would never say that. They said it.

725
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:21,611
Well, you two must have been a great team!

726
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:24,656
Only when we agreed on things,
which was never.

727
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,116
I agree with that.

728
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,492
What's the problem, Buck?

729
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:30,453
She's pretty cool
with that super spray of hers.

730
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,414
Hey, what's your superpower anyway?

731
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,543
Boys, what makes a superhero isn't powers.

732
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:41,464
It's resourcefulness and courage.

733
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,592
Yeah, that's what they always say
when they don't have any powers.

734
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,012
Anyways, back to the plan.

735
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:50,598
We have a control freak egomaniac
to catch up to.

736
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:53,518
Yeah. And we've also gotta stop Orson.

737
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,270
- [animals screaming]
- [gasps]

738
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:02,610
This is my worst-case scenario.
They're heading for the watering hole!

739
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:08,283
[roaring]

740
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:16,875
Blimey. Orson's gonna serve his raptors
an all-you-can-eat mammal buffet.

741
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:18,877
[slurping]

742
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,547
Okay, here's the plan.

743
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,841
[Buck] No time for a plan!

744
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:28,094
There is always time for a pla...

745
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:31,056
Okay, he can't hear me anymore.

746
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:32,640
[birds chirping]

747
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:37,103
[grunts, exclaims]

748
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:38,396
Whoa! [grunts]

749
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,522
[grunts]

750
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:40,732
[grunts]

751
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:42,317
Hey.

752
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:47,364
- Everyone, we face a grave threat!
- [chattering]

753
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:49,908
- Are we out of fruity drinks again?
- [gasping]

754
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:53,078
We've gotta clear the area.
File out in an orderly fashion.

755
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:56,831
- Two by two, one by three, five by nine.
- [chattering]

756
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:59,584
- [stampeding, growling]
- [animals scream]

757
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:04,297
- [growls]
- [gasp]

758
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,051
Nope, still can't fly. [screams]

759
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:09,969
[grunts]

760

- [yells, grunts]
- [growls]

762
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,101
- No!
- [roars]

763
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:17,602
[squeals]

764

- Go, go, go!

00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:21,439
- [animals scream]
- [raptors roar]

766

[roars]

767
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:26,820
[martial arts-style vocalizing]

768
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,657
It's time to get buck wild!

769
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,200
[Buck] Ow!

770
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:36,246
What'd you do that for?

771
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,872
Look!

772
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:43,670
[raptors growl]

773
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,509
Buck! Oh, boy,
do I have a surprise for you.

774
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:51,469
Behold!

775
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:54,514
[raptors roaring]

776
00:41:58,226 --> 00:42:00,937
He's done it. He's built an army.

777
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,857
I'm gonna RSVP "no" to this party.

778
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:05,734
We need to get out of here.

779
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:09,404
[roaring, growling]

780
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:19,873
[crunch]

781
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:21,583
[squeaking]

782
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:24,002
I'm coming for you, Bucky!

783
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:26,921
And you won't weasel your way out
the next time.

784
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:29,966
You can't protect
the mammals forever, Buck.

785
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,720
My new raptor army
will eventually hunt you down.

786
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,431
Now we really need a plan.

787
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:37,724
[sighs]

788
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:42,562
We'll never defeat Orson if you keep going
all "buck wild" without thinking first.

789
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:46,649
The more important question
is what does "Zee" stand for?

790
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:50,236
Aw. You're cute. [chuckles]
Let's stay on track, shall we?

791
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,864
We are completely outmatched.

792
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:56,868
If we're gonna defeat Orson,
we're gonna need some big-time help.

793
00:42:56,951 --> 00:43:01,831
Hmm. Would you look at that?
I agree with Zee. We do need help.

794
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:05,085
And there's only one creature
who can handle the job.

795
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:13,009
Did you hear what he said? He said we!
He sees us as equals.

796
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,179
Actually, I think he meant…

797
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:20,642
total equals. You got it. [chuckles]

798
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:23,353
Oh, and, uh, by the way, fellas,
the name thing?

799
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:25,230
[clicks tongue] It's just Zee.

800
00:43:25,313 --> 00:43:27,857
- [leaves rustle]
- Yeah, I'm not buying it.

801
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:36,783
My bone boat.

802
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:39,494
Whoa! Buck's bone boat.

803
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:41,371
I believe it's our bone boat.

804
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:44,582
Whoa! Buck and Zee's bone boat.

805
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,252
- I built it.
- I designed it.

806
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:48,795
It didn't need a design.

807
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:50,171
[both grunt]

808
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:51,589
[water splashing]

809
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:53,550
That's why the first boat sank.

810
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:57,262
It didn't sink. The water rose.

811
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:59,139
Do you sense some tension between them?

812
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,223
Maybe a little.

813
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:20,994
We'll reach Lost Lagoon by morning.

814
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:23,621
You know what I'm wondering?

815
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:26,791
Why we're going to Lost Lagoon
and who's gonna help us defeat Orson?

816
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,544
No. I'm wondering
why my butt's stuck to the seat.

817
00:44:29,627 --> 00:44:30,628
Tree sap.

818
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:32,172
You know what else I'm wondering?

819
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:34,507
How could they have been
such a fierce team,

820
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,009
but still not get along?

821
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,928
I bet it's 'cause Zee never told him
what the "Zee" stood for.

822
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:41,973
Okay, out with it. Is it Zeeva?

823
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:43,558
- Zelda?
- Zeena?

824
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:45,602
- Zsa Zsa? [grunts]
- Zamantha.

825
00:44:45,685 --> 00:44:46,728
Zippy?

826
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:49,397
I'm sorry. Did you just say Zippy?

827
00:44:49,481 --> 00:44:51,149
[as Lefty] I told you it wasn't Zippy.

828
00:44:51,232 --> 00:44:54,235
Uh, once again,
Zee doesn't stand for anything.

829
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,029
And that's not the reason.

830
00:44:56,112 --> 00:44:57,906
So what is the reason?

831
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:02,285
- It's because he... Never mind.
- It's because she... Never mind.

832
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:04,537
Let's work this out like family.

833
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:07,248
Yeah, use your feeling words.

834
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:08,625
I feel…

835
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,543
I feel.

836
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:15,131
Well, I feel Buck was stubborn
and reckless.

837
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:18,385
Well, I feel Zee gets too hung up
on details.

838
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:21,137
I also feel sad about my first boat.

839
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:24,099
[gasps] This is good.
I think we're getting somewhere.

840
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:26,351
You're irresponsible, thickheaded.

841
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:28,478
- You're demanding, and you're always…
- I'm tired of you…

842
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:30,647
- …being mean to me.
- …always leaping before you look.

843
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,483
- Recklessly hurling us into trouble.
- …but the rest of the team didn't.

844
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:35,068
We needed to have a strategy.

845
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:36,653
Your way didn't work!

846
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:38,279
We lost our team.

847
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:44,661
I know, Zee. But maybe there was nothing
we could do to save them.

848
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:48,164
Maybe not, but you were my best friend.

849
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,458
And I lost you too.

850
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:54,421
Zee. [sighs]

851
00:45:56,464 --> 00:45:57,507
[groans]

852
00:45:58,341 --> 00:46:00,218
I feel that could've gone better.

853
00:46:19,654 --> 00:46:21,281
[wolves howling]

854
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,996
Crash, I'm starting to think.

855
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,081
Oh, no. Now you're doing it too.

856
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:32,083
When we left the herd,

857
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:35,503
we swore we'd become independent
and make our mark.

858
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:38,048
- Yeah, but how?
- [snoring]

859
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:41,134
Buck needs some shut-eye
and we're nocturnal.

860
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:45,055
This is our chance to prove ourselves.
Follow my lead.

861
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:47,515
Hmm. [yells]

862
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,600
[thud]

863
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:50,477
[continues snoring]

864
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:54,272
Okay, Lost Lagoon is due south.

865
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:55,940
We have to turn this boat around.

866
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:57,901
You're holding the map upside down.

867
00:46:57,984 --> 00:46:59,402
Oh, well, in that case, we're good!

868
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,529
- We're doing it! High five!
- [both yell]

869
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:07,118
Oh. When is tea ready, Mum?

870
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:11,164
[exclaims, snores]

871
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:19,005
[creaking]

872
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:21,591
[grunts]

873
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:24,135
[snoring]

874
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:28,098
- [Crash] Buck?
- [Eddie] Buck?

875
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:29,391
[Crash] Buck?

876
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:31,893
[both imitating chickens]
Buck? Buck? Buck, Buck, Buck,

877
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:34,270
Buck, Buck, Buck,
Buck, Buck, Buck, Buck, Buck,

878
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:35,480
- Buck!
- [yells]

879
00:47:35,563 --> 00:47:36,690
Did I drift off?

880
00:47:37,273 --> 00:47:39,526
It's all good, Buck.
We kept the boat on track

881
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:42,278
and made you a delicious a-breakfast.

882
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:45,156
You got these from the trees?

883
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,366
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

884
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:50,495
That's very nice,
but they're also very poisonous.

885
00:47:50,578 --> 00:47:53,415
From now on, keep your paws
and tails inside the boat.

886
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:54,958
You don't know what's out there.

887
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:57,961
Oh, so maybe we shouldn't have
snagged these jump ropes.

888
00:47:58,044 --> 00:47:59,796
- [snakes hiss, rattle]
- Uh. [chuckles]

889
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:02,924
Guys, those are more poisonous
than the berries.

890
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,551
- We're immune to snake venom.
- [hisses]

891
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:07,303
Yeah, but I'm not. It would kill me.

892
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:10,598
It would make me break out
and then kill me.

893
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:11,725
Our bad.

894
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:13,893
Sorry, Zsa Zsa.

895
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,523
Should we not have
adopted these cute pet lizards either?

896
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:24,779
Maybe we're not ready to prove ourselves.

897
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:26,906
Ha! Speak for yourself.

898
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:32,996
Okay, you can speak for both of us.

899
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:51,514
We've made it!
Time to summon an old friend.

900
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,850
[plays note]

901
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:58,480
[snarling]

902
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:01,149
[thudding]

903
00:49:04,861 --> 00:49:08,073
[roars]

904
00:49:08,823 --> 00:49:11,159
Crash, it's Mama T. rex!

905
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:13,411
Wait, you know Mama T?

906
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:16,206
Uh-huh. Our friend Sid
used to babysit her kids.

907
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,667
She's gonna help us take out Orson.

908
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:23,546
Well, that totally makes sense.
She's 15 tons of deadly, vicious terror!

909
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:26,174
No offense, Mama. [shouts]

910
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:30,804
What's wrong, girl?

911
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:32,055
[groans]

912
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:36,017
Toothache, huh? Come on.
Let Dr. Buck take a look.

913
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:44,275
Left upper incisor impacted.
Lower right molar missing.

914
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:46,778
Ah! There's the bad tooth.

915
00:49:47,278 --> 00:49:49,322
Yeah, I've got to 86 the 23.

916
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:53,326
That's what happens, young lady,
when you don't floss.

917
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,203
Which is why we use our tails.

918
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:58,915
Well, how can she help us defeat Orson
with a bad tooth?

919
00:49:58,998 --> 00:50:00,375
[Buck] That is a good question.

920
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:03,712
- I'm gonna need to pull it. Oi!
- [growls]

921
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:10,635
Well, if you're not going to let me help,
I guess I'll have to just give up.

922
00:50:19,352 --> 00:50:22,230
[roars]

923
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:25,275
[thuds]

924
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:27,777
Whoa! Respect.

925
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,031
[grunting]

926
00:50:33,241 --> 00:50:34,492
Hurry.

927
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:36,453
I'm performing surgery here.

928
00:50:36,536 --> 00:50:40,123
If I let go, she'll surgically remove
your top from your bottom.

929
00:50:40,206 --> 00:50:41,583
Boy, it's really in there. [grunts]

930
00:50:43,918 --> 00:50:46,379
Okay, Zee. All done. Time to wake her up.

931
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:49,215
I just knock 'em out. I don't wake 'em up.

932
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,176
[snarling]

933
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:53,511
Incoming! We've got raptors!

934
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:55,764
Come on, boys! Let's get her up.

935
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:57,515
We need to call in reinforcements.

936
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,476
She is the reinforcements!

937
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:01,936
Hello? Anyone home?

938
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,064
You can sleep when you're dead!

939
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:05,273
Why'd you knock her out?

940
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:06,441
You told me to.

941
00:51:06,524 --> 00:51:07,901
- No, I didn't.
- You winked.

942
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:10,653
I only have one eye.
Technically, that's a blink.

943
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:12,238
[snarling]

944
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:15,241
- Nap time's over.
- What did you have, bricks for lunch?

945
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:16,493
[Zee shouts]

946
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:18,661
Well, here goes nothing.

947
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,373
Heads up, buttercup.

948
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:23,833
[Zee] Go, go, go!

949
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:27,671

[slow clapping]

951
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:38,014
Oh, you're pathetic, Buck.

952
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,975
Did you really think reuniting with Zee

953
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:45,021
and recruiting some T. rex
could help you defeat my army?

954
00:51:48,858 --> 00:51:50,318
[snarling]

955
00:51:58,076 --> 00:51:59,452
[raptors squeal]

956
00:52:03,206 --> 00:52:05,125
[thuds]

957
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,210
Well, that was the idea. Yes.

958
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:10,755
Evidently, I miscalculated,
but nobody's perfect.

959
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:15,677
Except me, that is. I'm a genius
who's about to rule the Lost World.

960
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,679
Over our dead bodies!

961
00:52:17,762 --> 00:52:22,809
My plan exactly. Soon everyone
will bow to me and call me king.

962
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:24,936
Excuse me. Mm-hmm.

963
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,480
I'm trying to do my evil here!

964
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:29,566
I'm on a bit of a roll.

965
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:32,444
But enough of this discourse.

966
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:35,155
Let the feeding frenzy begin!

967
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:39,325
[Orson chuckles]

968
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:40,994
[snarling]

969
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:43,246
[screams]

970
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:49,586
Buck!

971
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:55,675
[gasps]

972
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,762
[cackling]

973
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,768
Get away! Get away! Down!

974
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:08,355
Spray 'em, Zee!

975
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:11,858
I just sprayed!
I need time to refill, okay?

976
00:53:11,941 --> 00:53:13,985
Ooh! TMI, dude.

977
00:53:25,997 --> 00:53:27,248
[Eddie shouting]

978
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:49,562
[sighs]

979
00:53:52,023 --> 00:53:54,776
Actually, Zee, it was all my fault.

980
00:53:55,276 --> 00:53:58,154
You're right.
We lost the team because of me.

981
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:00,990
No, it was because of me.

982
00:54:01,074 --> 00:54:03,743
No, I insist I take the blame.

983
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:06,955
Well, I insist you return the blame
and give it to me.

984
00:54:07,038 --> 00:54:10,583
Look, it wasn't you. It wasn't me.

985
00:54:12,168 --> 00:54:13,586
- It was us.
- It was us.

986
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:17,048
If we really want harmony
in the Lost World,

987
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:19,843
it has to start with you and me
working together.

988
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:25,598
[muffled laughing]

989
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:31,771
Get Mama and the possums to safety.

990
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:40,989
Wha... What's he doing?

991
00:54:41,072 --> 00:54:42,574
Giving us time to escape.

992
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:45,660
Okay, brainiac.

993
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:47,370
It's me you want.

994
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:49,748
You got me.

995
00:54:50,915 --> 00:54:53,335
I win! [laughs]

996
00:54:55,503 --> 00:54:57,464
[Orson] Take him to the watering hole.

997
00:54:57,547 --> 00:55:01,509
There, I'll make an example of him
in front of all the other mammals.

998
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:03,720
Whoa. [laughs]

999
00:55:03,803 --> 00:55:05,555
Revenge is mine.

1000
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:08,850
Hey, great idea alert.

1001
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:12,228
Guess who had it? Me. Of course.

1002
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:24,908
[roaring]

1003
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:26,785
[Zee] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy now.

1004
00:55:26,868 --> 00:55:29,245
Just get your strength back, Mama T.

1005
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:33,124
Orson's taking Buck back
to the watering hole. Meet us there.

1006
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:50,100
- [rumbling]
- [snarling]

1007
00:56:02,904 --> 00:56:04,239
[snarling]

1008
00:56:54,205 --> 00:56:56,750
[sighs] This is all our fault, Eddie.

1009
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,919
Buck said it was
a bad time for us to visit.

1010
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:02,380
Yeah, if he didn't have to
look out for us,

1011
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:04,174
maybe this never would have happened.

1012
00:57:04,257 --> 00:57:06,217
I wish we could've done something
to help him.

1013
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:08,261
- Like what?
- I don't know.

1014
00:57:08,803 --> 00:57:12,057
Something cool,
like master the power of lightning.

1015
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,976
Whoa! How awesome would that be?

1016
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,854
Crash and Eddie: Lightning Masters!

1017
00:57:17,937 --> 00:57:22,317
Yeah, we'd be all zap this and zap that.
And zap the first thing again.

1018
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:24,736
Ah, face it, bro.

1019
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:28,198
We're never gonna be lightning masters,
or make our mark.

1020
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:30,075
Or pretty much do anything.

1021
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,494
Ellie was right about us.

1022
00:57:32,577 --> 00:57:34,621
We're not ready to be on our own.

1023
00:57:35,288 --> 00:57:36,456
[both scream]

1024
00:57:36,998 --> 00:57:40,085
Is this what Buck would do? Give up? Sulk?

1025
00:57:40,168 --> 00:57:41,920
But we let him down.

1026
00:57:42,003 --> 00:57:45,131
Which means it's time to buck up.

1027
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,300
You mean rush in without thinking?

1028
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:48,677
[chuckles]

1029
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,595
Yeah, well, he would do that.

1030
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:54,265
I, however, wouldn't have left
without a plan to rescue him.

1031
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:56,601
But I'm gonna need your help.

1032
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:58,645
We could if we had a superpower.

1033
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:01,690
Remember what Buck taught you.

1034
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:04,275
It's not powers that make you a superhero.

1035
00:58:05,276 --> 00:58:07,153
It's courage.

1036
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:08,863
And resourcefulness.

1037
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,701
Maybe that's our problem, Crash.

1038
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:15,870
Whenever we're in trouble,
all we do is play dead.

1039
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:17,622
Well, it is our go-to move.

1040
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:20,500
Yeah, but it's kinda
the opposite of courage.

1041
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:22,544
Yeah, I see that.

1042
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:25,213
But where can we get courage?

1043
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:26,798
You already have it…

1044
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:28,883
right here.

1045
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,969
In our chest fur?

1046
00:58:31,636 --> 00:58:33,930
She means our spleens.

1047
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:35,181
Yeah!

1048
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:39,728
If we can harness the power
of our spleens, we can master lightning!

1049
00:58:40,395 --> 00:58:41,563
[groans]

1050
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:46,735
We're here on Raptor River.

1051
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:49,904
[Zee] Orson's got Buck
here at the watering hole.

1052
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:51,781
We'll launch a surprise attack.

1053
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:54,659
Like a surprise party with weapons.
[squeals]

1054
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:58,913
Mmm… I dunno, Zee,
or whatever your real name is.

1055
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:02,334
The three of us
against Orson's whole army?

1056
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,418
Hey!

1057
00:59:03,501 --> 00:59:05,712
You would be surprised
what we're capable of.

1058
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:09,049
I just wish we knew
how Orson controls the raptors.

1059
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:12,802
Maybe he gives them treats.
I know I'd do anything for a marshmallow.

1060
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:14,262
Would you marry a frog?

1061
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:16,306
- What kind of frog?
- Focus, guys.

1062
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:18,141
It's time to train for the mission.

1063
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:28,943
[groans, stammers]

1064
00:59:37,827 --> 00:59:39,120
Ha, ha, ha!

1065
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:46,711
Whoa.

1066
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:49,798

Oh. Right in the possum parts. [groans]

01:00:20,328 --> 01:00:21,746
- Yeah!
- Ha, ha!

1072
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:37,846
[panting]

1073
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:42,308
Face it, guys.
Crash and Eddie have gone bye-bye.

1074
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:45,061
They totally disappeared without a trace!

1075
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:46,187
[sighs]

1076
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:47,522
I got footprints.

1077
01:00:47,605 --> 01:00:48,815
[groans]

1078
01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:51,568
All that means is their feet
were around here.

1079
01:00:52,944 --> 01:00:55,155
Thank goodness. We're back on their trail.

1080
01:00:55,238 --> 01:00:57,407
It looks like their trail leads to a...

1081
01:00:58,074 --> 01:01:02,078
Oh, no! Those ding-dongs
went back to the Lost World!

1082
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:04,998
Oh. And I thought I made bad choices.

1083
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,182
[raptors snarling]

1084
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:27,687
[gasps] We're in luck!
Orson's raptors got smaller.

1085
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:29,147
Ha! They're tiny.

1086
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:33,109
I say we crush them like ants,
then shoot hoops at the watering hole.

1087
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:35,904
Guys, they're not tiny.
They're just far away.

1088
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:39,908
Oh. Well, in that case,
we're in huge trouble.

1089
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:45,413
Remember.

1090
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:53,129
[Zee] It's time to get…

1091
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:55,423
Buck wild!

1092
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,681
The entrance is blocked.
Do you think they got through?

1093
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,724
Only one way to find out.

1094
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:08,228

Come on.

1099
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:32,460
Whew! Those upper body workouts
really paid off. [chuckles]

1100
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:34,546
Come on! We need to find Buck.

1101
01:02:34,629 --> 01:02:36,381
He's their only hope down here.

1102
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:37,882
[Manny] Oh, great.

1103
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:41,678
Their lives may depend on
an unstable weasel who talks to his hand.

Oh, no! Crash and Eddie are in trouble.

1126
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:34,022
You say that like it's news.

This is farewell, Buck.

1130
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:48,828
Time to turn you into a chew toy
for my ravenous friends here.

1131
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:51,331
You'll never get away with this.

1132
01:03:51,414 --> 01:03:53,708
There's no way I'm letting
my pumpkin daughter

1133
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:55,126
grow up without a father.

1134
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,253
What? Okay, I'm done.

1135
01:03:57,337 --> 01:04:02,133
Dinner is served,
compliments of King Orson.

1136

Ooh, I like the sound of that.

- [Crash] Whoo-hoo!
- [Eddie] Yeah!

1142
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:21,361
Huh? [groaning]

1143
01:04:21,444 --> 01:04:23,363
Ooh! Morons!

1144
01:04:23,446 --> 01:04:25,615
[laughs] Good work, fellas!

1145
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:27,075
Get skunked!

1146
01:04:27,158 --> 01:04:28,326
Yeah!

Hi-yah!

[gas bubbles popping]

1149
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:41,589
I love the smell of skunky gas
in the morning.

1150

- Whoo!

Yeah!

[Sid] Hang on, Crash and Eddie.
Here comes the T. rex express! [laughs]

1157
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:21,588
[Zee] Buck!

1158

Hey-ya!

1159
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:36,436
Whoo!

1160
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:39,981
[Zee] Whoa!

1161
01:05:43,651 --> 01:05:46,279
You took a big chance
giving yourself up back there.

1162
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:48,573
That's what you do in a herd.

1163
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:52,285
Besides, I knew you'd be the one
to come and rescue me.

1164
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:57,290
So, what now?
I'm sure you have something in mind.

1165
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:59,542
How about we make it up as we go along?

1166
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:01,961
Now, that's what I call a plan.

- [Eddie] Whoa!
- [Crash laughs]

1170
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:18,853
[Eddie laughing]

1171
01:06:19,646 --> 01:06:22,774
Okay, I'm confused. What just happened?

1172
01:06:22,857 --> 01:06:26,027
I believe Crash and Eddie
just kicked some serious butt.

1173
01:06:27,153 --> 01:06:28,154

Wait for me, guys!

01:06:48,633 --> 01:06:49,676
Yes!

1180
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:03,606
You've been nothing but
a thorn in my side from the start.

1181
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:06,234
You just never got it, Orson.

1182
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:09,154
The Lost World
isn't meant to be ruled by anyone.

1183
01:07:09,237 --> 01:07:12,532
Not just anyone. Me! [shouts]

All right, who wants some?

01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:27,505
Take this!

1187
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:30,091
And that! Huh?

1188
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:34,054
Time to get a little less mammoth
and a little more possum.

1189
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:40,352
All right! [screaming]

1190
01:07:42,937 --> 01:07:44,814
Back off. He's family.

1191
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:47,150
Besides, he's high in saturated fats.

1192
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:50,653
Look, the truth is we all need each other.

Down here, all creatures,
mammals and dinos alike,

1196
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:00,080
we need to live in harmony.

Oh, you are so naive.

This is why I feel sorry for you, Buck.

1199
01:08:05,418 --> 01:08:06,920
You're too idealistic.

1200
01:08:07,003 --> 01:08:11,299
In the real world, it's survival
of the fittest, or should I say smartest.

1201
01:08:21,601 --> 01:08:23,603
Oh! Nailed it.

Or do you? [laughs]

1214
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:59,639
Seems I've outsmarted you once again.

1215
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:02,517
They're gonna tear
your little friends to pieces,

1216

and then they're gonna come for you.

1217

Watch this, Buckmeinster.

1218
01:09:08,648 --> 01:09:09,858
It's showtime.

1219

It's the fire!

1220

That's how he gets them

Remember what Zee said?
The answer is in our chest fur.

Oh, come on, guys.
We're not falling for that.

Yes! Well done, lads!

1233
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:18,259
That's called using your spleens!

1234

Ha, what do you know, Eddie?
We do have a superpower.

What have I told you about boundaries?

With good reason.
And you worried about us.

I love you guys.

1270
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:02,906
[straining] We love you too.

1271
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:04,699
Hey.

1272
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:06,201
[both gasp]

1273
01:12:06,284 --> 01:12:08,119
You guys actually did it.

1274
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,913
I'm proud of you.

1275
01:12:11,164 --> 01:12:12,499
I never doubted them.

1276
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:16,252
Okay, I doubted them a little.

1277
01:12:16,336 --> 01:12:18,463
Boys, I didn't know you had it in you.

1278
01:12:18,546 --> 01:12:20,924
Mostly because you act like
total dimwits all the time.

1279
01:12:21,007 --> 01:12:24,177
Aw. I love family reunions.

1280
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:27,806
But there's no buffet,
so time to head home.

1281
01:12:27,889 --> 01:12:30,600
- About that...
- [Buck] Hello, mates.

1282
01:12:30,684 --> 01:12:34,020
This is Zee. She's a very dear friend.

1283
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:36,272
It's nice to meet you, Zee.

1284
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:40,443
The way you took charge out there,
I'd swear you were part possum.

1285
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:42,570
Actually, she's a zorilla.

1286
01:12:42,654 --> 01:12:44,948
It's like a skunk, only cooler.

1287
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:48,451
And my name may or may not be Zsa Zsa.

1288
01:12:48,535 --> 01:12:50,328
[both gasp]

1289
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:51,621
[laughs]

1290
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:54,958
We were lucky to have possums
join our superhero squad.

1291
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:57,210
Really? A superhero squad?

1292
01:12:57,293 --> 01:12:58,962
She said it. I didn't.

1293
01:12:59,045 --> 01:13:01,172
You're probably gonna want our autographs.

1294
01:13:01,256 --> 01:13:02,465
- No thanks.
- I'm good.

1295
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:05,218
Well, now that you've had
your big adventure,

1296
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:07,846
I suppose you'll be heading back home.

1297
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:11,558
After all,
you're probably bored of old Buck

1298
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:14,853
and his daring, action-packed,
thrill-a-minute lifestyle.

1299
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:18,273
Uh…Yeah.

1300
01:13:18,356 --> 01:13:22,152
Yeah, I am. Boring. Just so, so bored.

1301
01:13:22,235 --> 01:13:23,820
Total snoozefest.

1302
01:13:28,241 --> 01:13:33,580
Actually, the truth is,
Eddie and I have been thinking…

1303
01:13:33,663 --> 01:13:36,249
Which we're slowly getting better at.

1304
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:38,209
Uh… Yeah.

1305
01:13:39,836 --> 01:13:43,548
The thing is,
we kinda, sorta like it here.

1306
01:13:47,886 --> 01:13:49,137
Eddie, you talk now.

1307
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:56,603
We wanna stay down here,
but we wanna know that you'll be okay.

1308
01:13:59,147 --> 01:14:02,442
It seems like it was just yesterday
we were kids.

1309
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:05,153
I thought we'd always be together.

1310
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:07,906
Are you sure it's what you want?

1311
01:14:12,285 --> 01:14:14,079
Then I'll be fine.

1312
01:14:17,832 --> 01:14:20,126
[cheering] We're staying!

1313
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,962
Oh, magic! [chuckles]

1314
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:25,298
I've been a loner for too long.

1315
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:28,718
Zee made me realize
we're all stronger together than apart.

1316
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:32,138
It's time for me to have a real family.

1317
01:14:32,222 --> 01:14:34,974
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
- Oh, yeah.

1318
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:36,935
- [Crash] Go, Buck.
- [Eddie] Go, Buck.

1319
01:14:37,018 --> 01:14:39,104
- [Crash] Go, Buck.
- [Eddie] Go, Buck. Yeah.

1320
01:14:39,187 --> 01:14:40,522
[Crash] Buck, Buck, Buck!

1321
01:14:40,605 --> 01:14:44,943
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm gonna miss you guys.

1322
01:14:45,026 --> 01:14:47,028
Yeah, we'll miss you guys too.

1323
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:51,574
Yeah, okay. Enough of this lovefest.

1324
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:54,619
Is that a tear in your eye, Diego?

1325
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:56,538
No. And it never happened.

1326
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:58,748
Look at you. You're such a softy.

1327

01:15:40,081 --> 01:15:42,292
Promise me you'll visit all the time.

1330
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:43,918
We will.

1331
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:46,546
Especially when we need something.
