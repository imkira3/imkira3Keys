00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,557
B-Ba-san!

3
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,643
N-No, you've got it all wrong! I wasn't...

4
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,244
"Gokai," you say?

5
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,580
Of course! Isn't it obvious? Never mind that...

6
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:11,814
Anyone else?

7
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,449
8th floor, please.

8
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,986
--12th floor.
--Very good.

9
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,444
Wha--?

10
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,976
5th floor, women's clothing.

11
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,461
Hey, Ba-san, what's the meaning of...?

12
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,369
Wha--?

13
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,298
What is this?!

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,222
Oh, it was a dream?

16
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,490
Ah, that was a shock.

17
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,447
What's with these pajamas?!

18
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:21,150
And what's with these walls?!

19
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,252
Huh?!

20
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,356
Honey, are you awake?

21
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,848
"Honey"?

22
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,729
Good morning, Yu-chan.

23
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,497
Botan!

24
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:38,534
Come on, come on, you have to hurry and get
yourself ready, before the chief gets here.

25
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:42,905
Uh, never mind that,
what are you doing here?

26
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:46,609
--Yow!
--Oh, Yu-chan, you're not quite awake yet.

27
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,777
Here.

28
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:51,704
Ah, thanks. Uh, I mean...

29
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:57,453
There, you see? They're here! Hurry, hurry!

30
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,756
Yes, coming!

31
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,357
Hey, Botan!

32
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,192
Geez, what's going on?

33
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,862
I'm so sorry, he hasn't had his breakfast yet.

34
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,364
He really is a night owl, you know?

35
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,200
Not at all. You guys are newlyweds, after all.

36
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,102
Yes, indeed.

37
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,371
Hey, Kurama and Hiei!

38
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,525
Why are you two ganging up
with her in all of this nonsense?

39
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,214
W-What?!

40
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,183
Such a newlywed.

41
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,584
You guys!

42
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:33,489
Hey, Yu-chan, don't you take
that tone with your chief.

43
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,624
Chief?

44
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:39,929
Oh, no, it's all right. Youngsters
need to have this kind of spunk.

45
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,165
Right, Kurama-kun?

46
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,599
Absolutely.

47
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,902
Well now, we should get going.

48
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,537
Where?! To do what?!

49
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,691
Come on, now. Here's your lunch.
Do you have your handkerchief?

50
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,268
Enough, already!

51
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:06,539

Oh, it was a dream?

53
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,508
Whoa! W-What the...?

54
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:29,679
Dammit, they're shooting at us like mad!

55
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,647
Kuwabara!

56
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,117
Haven't you gotten through to HQ yet?

57
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:37,019
No, sir. I've been calling
them for some time, though.

58
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:41,157
Damn, what are those guys at HQ thinking?

59
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,792
The way things are going,
it's only a matter of time

60
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,127
before the Earth meets her end!

61
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,428
Guys!

62
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,829
What are you up to?

63
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,844
Get down!

64
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,605
You idiot! Are you trying
to get yourseif killed?!

65
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,741
Ah, you startled me.

66
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,843
Branch Manager, look there.

67
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,280
Ah! They're easy targets.

68
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,415
Huh? Keiko!

69
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,951
What's that, Urameshi? You know her?

70
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,887
Huh? Know her? She's...

71
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,822
That works out perfectly.

72
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,192
Branch Manager,
Urameshi and I will charge in!

73
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:20,096
Good! Make sure to
secure the contract. Got it?

74
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,764
Yes, sir!

75
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,882
Let's go, Urameshi!

76
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,336
Enemy fighters at 15 o'clock!

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,192
Get down!

78
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,595
W-What the hell is going on here?!

79
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:44,541

80
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,546
But then, get this, out of nowhere...

81
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:56,199
...he says, "I also admit that
your knees are unbearably cute,

82
00:05:56,223 --> 00:06:02,572
but you show them off too much, don't you?"

83
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,998
Do you think that maybe he has
a thing for you, Shizuru-san?

84
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:11,214
Oh, bleah! You've got to be kidding.
That over-the-hill old coot?

85
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:12,982
Yo!

86
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,885
What are you two up to together out here?

87
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,521
--Ah-choo!
--Ow!

88
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,057
Oh, piease, excuse us.

89
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,260
Um, we're here on behalf of this interest...

90
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,128
The Paradise News?

91
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,712
Ah, we're good.

92
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,235
One month is all we ask.

93
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,604
And if you sign up now,
I'll include this squid ink lotion

94
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,874
and smoked mudskipper, at no charge.

95
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,008
But we...

96
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:42,144
We already get a newspaper.

97
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,046
Might I ask which one?

98
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,232
The Gyaku-manji Daily.
(gyaku-manji: "swastika")

99
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,788
Y-You're kidding, right?!

100
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,457
Say...

101
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:58,440
Mister, you've stepped in doggie-doo.

102
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,203
Oh, it was a dream?

103
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,319
Man, that was one weird dream!

104
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,812
Honey, are you awake?

105
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,837
Hi!
