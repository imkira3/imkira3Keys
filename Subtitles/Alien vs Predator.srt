Come here.
Take a look at this.

9
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:51,626
What is it?

10
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:53,657
- It's a data stream from PS12.

11
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:54,897
- Where is she?

12
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:56,817
- Right above sector 14.

13
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,008
There isn't anything in sector 14.

14
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:01,491
There is now.

- Miss Woods.

17
00:04:33,938 --> 00:04:35,385
Pleasure to speak to you.

18
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:36,530
- Who is this?

19
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:40,492
- My name's Maxwell Stafford.
I represent Weyland Industries.

20
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,327
- Let me guess.
He's suing us again?

21
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,153
- You misunderstand.

22
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,503
Mr Weyland has offered to fund your
foundation for a year,

23
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,893
if you'll meet with him.

24
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:53,864
When?
Tomorrow.

25
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,249
Tomorrow's gonna be a problem.

26
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,945
Take me a week to get
back to the world.

27
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:02,636
Yes, I told Mr Weyland that.

28
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:06,385
He said he didn't have a week.

What is it, Sebastian?

32
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:04,929
Early 1950'ies, would i say.

33
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:08,100
Hey, Huan, we're almost there.

34
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:12,708
Acording to you, the final
gift to the king...

35
00:06:12,742 --> 00:06:13,972
was a Pepsi.

36
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:15,751
- Come again, give me one more month!
- No.

37
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:18,054
- Please.
- I'll bring antother team.

38
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:20,710
What?

39
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:24,236
Without a crew and a permit
we're out of business.

40
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,823
Hold the team together
for two days.

41
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:29,791
I'll go to Mexico City and I'll
talk to the bank.

42
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,619
I'll get us more money.

43
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:34,899
I might be able to help you
accomplish that, Professor.

44
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:37,838
Do I know you?

45
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,013
In exchange for a little
of your time.

Oh, I'm sorry.

49
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:11,003
I should've switched the flash off.

50
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:12,573
There's your magazine.

51
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:15,157
Excuse me.
That's OK.

52
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,189
I'm documenting the trip for my boys.
This is them.

54
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:24,638
Would you mind taking a picture?
Thank you.

55
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:27,891
Just wanna show them
that their dad wasn't always so boring.

56
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,806
- Smile.
- OK.

57
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,232
- There you go.

00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:44,231
- Do you work for Weyland?

62
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:45,119
- Oh, no.

63
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:49,809
No, I split my time between working
for a small environmental group

64
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,835
and taking scientists
on expeditions on the ice.

65
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:56,499
Lex. Buckle up.
We're gonna hit some turbulence.

66
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:57,799
Thanks, Jack.

67
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,574
- Is he a friend of yours?

68
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:04,293
- Of my dad's.
He trained most of the pilots here.

69
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:05,407
- Just passed the PSR.

70
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,720
- Oh, damn. I wish I'd got a picture.

71
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:10,915
- Of what?
- The PSR.

72
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,069
I wish he'd called it out before we passed it.

73
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,227
The PSR is the point of safe return.

74
00:08:18,262 --> 00:08:21,442
It means we've used up half our fuel,
so we can't turn back.

75
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,261
Right, but if something went wrong,

76
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,731
we could land, presumably.

77
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,108
- We could ditch.
- Yeah. Ditch.

78
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,734
But the temperature of the water
would kill us in three minutes.

You know what? We're gonna
listen to whatever he has to say.

We're not ****  polite they claime

00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:07,062
Pick the money and we
head back to Mexico.

84
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,543
- Right.
- Right.

85
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:21,239
Having fun?

86
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,811
Yeah. That's going to fetch ya.

87
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:25,412
Listen, My kids are not
going to belive this...

88
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:26,413
Do you mind taking a picture?

89
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:30,056
You have to hold it like that,
to the flash i lightning.

90
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:30,893
You kidding.

91
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,691
GET OF! Or wear your ass
for a hat!

92
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:37,199
Okey. I'm Fucked.
Alright, okey.

93
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,198
Nice team spirit.

94
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:42,439
Keep the "beekers"(?) away
from the gear.

95
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:47,943
What he means "beeka"?

96
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:50,255
It's what they call scientists up here.

97
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:53,046
You know "picker",
like in the muppet show.

98
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:56,848
Welcome aboard, everybody. Please.

99
00:10:02,573 --> 00:10:05,794
Mr Weyland.

100
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:19,094
Seven days ago,

101
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:22,047
one of my satellites
over Antarctica hunting for mineral deposits

102
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:24,468
discovered a sudden heat bloom
beneath the earth,

103
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:27,025
which outlined this.

104
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,009
The red lines indicate solid walls.

105
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:32,030
Through thermal mapping,

106
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,304
we've generated
a three-dimensional image of the structure.

107
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:40,259
It's massive,
containing hundreds of rooms,

108
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:42,729
all built around a central core.

109
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:46,497
My experts tell me it's a pyramid.

110
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:51,432
What they can't agree on
is who built it and when.

111
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,734
One expert tells me this has features
reminiscent of the Aztecs.

112
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:58,657
Another tells me it's probably Cambodian.

113
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,247
What they all agree on is that

114
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:03,191
the smooth side is definitively Egyptian.

115
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:04,985
- I think your experts are right.

116
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,748
- Which one?
- All of them.

117
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:09,278
- Meaning what, exactly?

118
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:14,799
This pyramid contains
the features of all three cultures.

119
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:19,363
This might be the first pyramid ever built.

120
00:11:19,943 --> 00:11:21,245
- But built by whom?

121
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:23,340
- By the first civilisation.

122
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:27,304
Thank you.

123
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:31,502
But how could anyone possibly
build a pyramid out here?

124
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:33,565
Ancient maps show Antarctica free of ice.

125
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,898
- It's likely the continent was once habitable.

126
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,538
- I can't tell you who built it.

127
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:43,209
But if I could take a sample from it,
I can tell you how old it is.

128
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,290
Dr Miller, I'm offering
to put you right next to this thing.

129
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,452
- What caused the heat bloom?

130
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:50,535
- I don't know.

131
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,518
- Where exactly on the ice is this?

132
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:54,500
- Bouvetoya Island.

133
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:58,278
But it's not on the ice.
It's 2,000ft below it.

134
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,401
- Mr Quinn?

135
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:05,903
- Mr Stafford.
You're looking at the best drilling team in the world.

136
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,645
We'll chew to that depth in seven days.

137
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:11,857
Add three weeks on top of that
to train everyone here.

138
00:12:11,892 --> 00:12:14,867
We don't have that kind of time, Ms Woods.

139
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,518
I'm not the only one
with a satellite over Antarctica.

140
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,072
Others will be here soon.

141
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:22,254
Maybe I wasn't clear.

142
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,056
No one in this room is ready for this trip.

143
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:26,806
That's why I asked you here.

144
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,881
Bouvetoya is one of the world's
most isolated places.

145
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:32,596
The nearest land is 1,000 miles away.

146
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:34,163
- There's no help if we run into trouble.

147
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,039
- You're right. It's a no-man's-land.

148
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,253
But the train has left the station.

149
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,775
And I think I speak
for everyone aboard this ship.

150
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:46,719
This is worth the risk.

151
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,797
Find another guide.

152
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:18,460
I've spoken with Mr Weyland.
Money's been wired to your account.

153
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:21,328
Chopper's refuelling to fly you home.

154
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:24,899
Who'd you get?

155
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:28,542
Gerald Murdoch.

156
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,490
- Come in.

157
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:36,201
- Murdoch has two seasons of ice time.
He's not ready.

158
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:38,446
- Don't worry about it.

159
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,360
- What about Paul Woodman?

160
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,437
- We called him.
- And?

161
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,665
- He gave the same bullshit answer you did.

162
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:45,197
"Bullshit"?

163
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:48,946
What I told you in there wasn't bullshit.

164
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:50,862
If you rush this, people will get hurt.

165
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:52,895
Maybe die.

166
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:56,556
I don't understand.
We're not asking you to take us up Everest.

167
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:59,658
We need you to take us from the ship
to the pyramid,

168
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:01,535
and back. That's it.

169
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,082
- What about inside the pyramid?

170
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:04,594
- Don't worry about that.

171
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:08,103
Once we're on the site, we have the best
technology and experts

172
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,250
that money can buy.

173
00:14:09,285 --> 00:14:10,794
- Is this new?
- It's the latest.

174
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:15,445
Mr Weyland, when I lead my team
I don't ever leave my team.

175
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,138
I admire your passion.

176
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,257
I wish you were going with us.

177
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:25,358
You're making a mistake.

178
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:34,977
It's in the upper atmosphere.

179
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:38,731
Streams of protons
and electrons from the sun

180
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:43,451
being deflected by the earth's magnetic
field, causing a solar radiation storm.

181
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:48,020
Shackleton called Antarctica
"the last great journey left to man".

182
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:51,769
It's the one place left in the world
that no one owns.

183
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:55,830
It's completely free.

184
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:57,392
Me,

185
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,008
I'm sort of partial to the penguins.

186
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:06,491
I wish you'd reconsider coming with us, Lex.

187
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:09,654
Come on, don't make me pull out
pictures of my kids again.

188
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,427
Your kids aren't that cute.

189
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:15,473
What if we got pictures
of other people's kids?

190
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,495
Want my advice?

191
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,268
Stay on the boat.

192
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:24,259
OK.

193
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,213
Let me ask you something.

194
00:15:27,204 --> 00:15:29,179
Do we stand a better chance
of surviving with you

195
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,382
or with the number-two choice?

196
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:37,186
Miss Woods, your helicopter's refuelled.

197
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:40,270
They're waiting for you.

198
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:47,241
Everybody, listen up!

199
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:50,289
Gather round.

200
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,088
Told you she'd stay.

201
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,659
She can't resist my animal magnetism.

202
00:16:55,383 --> 00:16:57,501
Laugh it up, Miller. Laugh it up.

203
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:58,714
Gentlemen?

204
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:03,918
It is my job to keep you alive
on this expedition,

205
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,422
and I need your help to do that.

206
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,066
Since I don't have time to properly train you,

207
00:17:09,206 --> 00:17:11,502
I'm laying down three rules.

208
00:17:11,537 --> 00:17:14,241
One. No one goes anywhere alone.

209
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:15,454
Ever.

210
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:17,529
Two:

211
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,378
Everyone must maintain
constant communication.

212
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,313
Three:

213
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:27,634
Unexpected things are gonna happen.
When they do ...

214
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,581
no one tries to be a hero.

215
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,376
Understood?

216
00:17:34,793 --> 00:17:36,418
Understood?

217
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:38,600
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

218
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:47,843
Seven seasons on the ice
and I've never seen a gun save someone's life.

219
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:49,639
- I don't plan on using it.

220
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:50,831
- Then why bring it?

221
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,356
Same principle as a condom.

222
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:55,766
I'd rather have one and not need it

223
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:58,273
than need it and not have one.

224
00:17:59,631 --> 00:18:02,020
I'm glad that you decided to stay.

225
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:06,129
Move the trucks out on the ice.

226
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:25,412
- What's with the bottle cap?

227
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:26,722
What?

228
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:27,988
What's with the bottle cap?

229
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:34,346
This is a valuable archaeological find.

230
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:44,174
When I was a kid
growing up in Italy,

231
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:46,762
you know what they call a moon that big?

232
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,547
La luna del cacciatore.

233
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:54,354
La luna del cacciatore.

234
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:55,350
Brava.

235
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,533
- What's that?

236
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,360
- Hunter's moon.

237
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,221
Hunter's moon.

238
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,865
Hold it, guys.

239
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:25,361
- Keep those engines running!

240
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,730
- Set it down.

241
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,185
Move over a little further. Connors.

242
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,852
It's an abandoned whaling station.

243
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:53,853
All right, bring it up. Come on.

244
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:58,021
According to your satellite imagery,
the pyramid is located directly beneath it.

245
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:16,618
All right, bring it up. Come on.
Spread out.

246
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:19,337
We'll use this place as a base camp.

247
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:20,777
Mr Quinn,

248
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:23,178
begin drilling operations as soon as you can.

249
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:24,351
I'm on it.

250
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:26,436
OK, guys, let's move out.

251
00:21:10,326 --> 00:21:11,392
- What are these?

252
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:12,620
- Whale bones.

253
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:18,098
This station was abandoned in 1904.

254
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:20,326
Everyone just disappeared overnight.

255
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:23,196
It was a big mystery back then.

256
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,728
One for National Geographic.

257
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,557
- Lex.

258
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,377
- No one goes anywhere alone.

259
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,596
There's something there. Listen. Listen.

260
00:23:15,622 --> 00:23:17,335
Careful. They bite.

261
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:33,405
Over here. Over here.
What is it?

262
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:36,807
Can you believe that?

263
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:48,780
It's drilled at a perfect 30-degree angle.

264
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:51,602
- How far does it go down?

265
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,564
- All the way to the pyramid.

266
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:56,401
There it is. Clear as day.

267
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:58,474
And the same time yesterday...

268
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:00,848
- Nothing.

269
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,177
- How was it done?

270
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,608
- Thermal equipment of some kind.

271
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:05,858
- Like yours?

272
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:08,710
More advanced.

273
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:10,829
Incredibly powerful.

274
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:14,627
I've never seen anything like it.

275
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:18,347
There's no team and no machine in the world

276
00:24:18,473 --> 00:24:20,663
that could cut to this depth in 24 hours.

277
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:23,179
Well, the only way we're gonna know for sure

278
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,919
is to get down there and find out.

279
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,030
Look at that. Change it. Now!

280
00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:55,244
OK, guys, what's taking so long?

281
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,137
There's a storm coming.

282
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:09,698
There's no room for sick men
on this expedition.

283
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:12,001
- My doctors tell me the worst is behind me.

284
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:14,698
- You're not a very good liar, Mr Weyland.

285
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,490
Stay on the ship.
We'll update you at the top of every hour.

286
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:20,656
When you get sick,

287
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,678
you think about your life
and how you're gonna be remembered.

288
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,177
You know what will happen when I go?

289
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:29,303
Ten per cent fall in share prices.
Maybe twelve.

290
00:25:29,893 --> 00:25:31,112
That's it.

291
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:33,263
I've heard this speech before.

292
00:25:34,712 --> 00:25:39,257
My dad broke his leg
700ft from the summit of Mount Rainier.

293
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:40,637
He was like you.

294
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,655
He wouldn't go back or let us stop.

295
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:47,257
We reached the top,
and he opened a bottle of champagne.

296
00:25:49,596 --> 00:25:53,630
I had my first drink with my dad
at 14,400ft.

297
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:59,139
On the way down, he developed a blood clot
in his leg that travelled to his lung.

298
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:03,978
He suffered for four hours
before dying 20 minutes from the base.

299
00:26:05,602 --> 00:26:07,786
You think that's the last thing
your dad remembers?

300
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:09,341
The pain?

301
00:26:10,565 --> 00:26:14,867
Or drinking champagne
with his daughter 14,000ft in the air?

302
00:26:18,164 --> 00:26:19,370
I need this.

303
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:17,836
Shit.

304
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:24,609
Mr Weyland!

305
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:26,047
Man down!

306
00:27:27,224 --> 00:27:27,941
Get him!

307
00:27:27,976 --> 00:27:29,436
Somebody get him!

308
00:27:53,685 --> 00:27:55,948
Move it!
Now!

309
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:27,958
I don't understand it.

310
00:29:28,943 --> 00:29:30,107
No equipment.

311
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:32,204
No sign of another team.

312
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,713
Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself.

313
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:40,490
Move it.

314
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,022
Connors, get those lights up.

315
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:45,002
We have power.

316
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:23,024
Congratulations, Mr Weyland.

317
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:26,133
Looks like you'll be
leaving your mark after all.

318
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:31,543
Thank you.

319
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:32,933
Thank you.

320
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:34,974
Thank you all for this.

321
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,839
Let's make history.

322
00:32:47,543 --> 00:32:48,445
Thomas.

323
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:51,937
What is it?

324
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:55,489
- I recognise the Egyptian...

325
00:32:55,621 --> 00:32:57,355
- The second symbol is Aztec.

326
00:32:57,735 --> 00:32:58,946
Pre-conquest era.

327
00:32:59,432 --> 00:33:01,139
The third is Cambodian.

328
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:02,357
Then you were right.

329
00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:04,866
The pyramid contains
all three cultures.

330
00:33:05,263 --> 00:33:06,636
- That's what it looks like.

331
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:09,119
You may...

332
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:10,766
- "Choose

333
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,288
to enter."

334
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:15,154
"Those who choose may enter."

335
00:33:15,973 --> 00:33:17,383
Who taught you to translate?

336
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:20,630
Funny. Kinda looked like you.

337
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:25,346
Well, it's not "choose".

338
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:27,660
It's "chosen".

339
00:33:28,494 --> 00:33:30,987
"Only the chosen ones may enter."

340
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:53,228
Quinn, is that you out there?

341
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,937
Mikkel.

342
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:25,893
What is all this?

343
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,184
This is the sacrificial chamber.

344
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:36,736
Like the Aztecs and the Egyptians.

345
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:38,042
Whoever built this pyramid

346
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:40,031
believed in ritual sacrifice.

347
00:36:42,084 --> 00:36:44,418
This is where the chosen ones
were offered to the gods.

348
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,836
Those that were chosen
would lie here.

349
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:01,305
They weren't bound or
tied in any way.

350
00:37:02,379 --> 00:37:04,166
They went to die willingly.

351
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:06,353
Men and women.

352
00:37:08,924 --> 00:37:10,692
It was considered an honour.

353
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:13,782
Lucky them.

354
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,806
Oh, god.

355
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,811
It's incredible.

356
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:27,620
The entire scull and spinal
collom removed in one piece.

357
00:37:29,304 --> 00:37:30,543
Look at this.

358
00:37:31,356 --> 00:37:33,344
Look at them.
The cleanness of the cup

359
00:37:34,495 --> 00:37:35,985
Straight through the bone.

360
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:38,019
It's no ***** , nothing.

361
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:53,438
It's probably the others,
moving trough the tunnels.

362
00:37:55,548 --> 00:37:56,641
Come here.

363
00:38:42,393 --> 00:38:44,590
Whatevet this been, it's
been dead a while.

364
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:47,033
The bones are completly
calcified.

365
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,446
No idea how long the bones
have been here...

366
00:38:48,564 --> 00:38:50,414
the temperature
keept it preserved.

367
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,897
It looks like some kind of scorpion.

368
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,969
No, climate to hostile(?)
for a scorpion.

369
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,982
Have you seen anything like it?

370
00:39:09,376 --> 00:39:11,347
"They gave their lives

371
00:39:11,635 --> 00:39:12,664
so the hunt

372
00:39:13,086 --> 00:39:14,089
could begin."

373
00:39:26,052 --> 00:39:27,410
What happened here?

374
00:39:28,303 --> 00:39:31,590
It's common in ritual sacrifice
to take the heart of the victim.

375
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:33,128
That's nice.

376
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,751
But that's not where your heart is.

377
00:39:38,198 --> 00:39:41,272
Besides, it looks like the bones
were bent straight out.

378
00:39:43,527 --> 00:39:45,802
Something broke out of this body.

379
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:41,121
- What have you found, Max?

380
00:40:41,768 --> 00:40:43,613
- It's a shaft to another level.

381
00:40:45,462 --> 00:40:47,560
Looks like there's another
room down there.

382
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,904
- Let's move to that lower room.

383
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:16,784
- We're moving on, everyone.

384
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:19,089
Ms Woods.

385
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,137
You.

386
00:41:22,269 --> 00:41:25,078
Stay here. Rousseau, you stay
with him. Keep a team with you.

387
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:26,867
Catalogue everything.

388
00:41:28,648 --> 00:41:29,948
Professor.

389
00:41:49,638 --> 00:41:52,491
This should be directly below
the sacrificial chamber.

390
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,236
Sebastian.

391
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,122
It's a sarcophagus.

392
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:17,780
This is the Long Count.

393
00:42:19,264 --> 00:42:21,241
This is the Aztec calendar.

394
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:22,560
And this...

395
00:42:22,596 --> 00:42:24,712
it's some kind of
combination lock.

396
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:28,686
Days.

397
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,773
Months.

398
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:33,768
Years.

399
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:36,867
The dials are set for...

400
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,460
1904.

401
00:42:45,006 --> 00:42:46,905
Someone opened this
100 years ago?

402
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:49,277
- What's today's date?

403
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:51,196
- October 10.

404
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,789
10/10/2004.

405
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,894
- Are you sure this is gonna work?

406
00:42:58,372 --> 00:42:59,285
- I don't know.

407
00:43:14,393 --> 00:43:15,493
Back up!

408
00:43:37,396 --> 00:43:38,477
Oh, my God.

409
00:43:38,512 --> 00:43:39,923
Take a look at this.

410
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,518
- Any idea what these are?

411
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,377
No.

412
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:10,361
You?

413
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,036
No.

414
00:44:12,064 --> 00:44:14,017
- It's a good thing we brought the experts.

415
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,098
- Well, yeah. It is a good thing.

416
00:44:16,368 --> 00:44:19,409
Cos this is like finding
Moses' DVD collection.

417
00:44:25,565 --> 00:44:26,347
Weyland?

418
00:44:29,993 --> 00:44:31,858
A little too much excitement.

419
00:44:34,393 --> 00:44:37,836
We've been out long enough for today.
We'll set up

420
00:44:37,871 --> 00:44:40,662
base camp at the whaling station
and get back at it tomorrow morning.

421
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:44,900
Well, you can go back to the base camp,
Ms Woods, but we're staying here.

422
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,360
No.

423
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:48,388
You wanted to leave
without proper prep.

424
00:44:48,423 --> 00:44:49,175
We did.

425
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,840
ou wanted to be the first here.

426
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:51,708
We are.

427
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:54,112
You've claimed the find. It's yours.

428
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:57,689
Now, we move as a team,
and we're done for the day.

429
00:44:59,303 --> 00:45:00,475
You heard her.

430
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,734
- What do you wanna do with these?

431
00:45:03,858 --> 00:45:04,689
Take them.

432
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:06,837
We'll run further tests on the surface.

433
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:08,636
No. No!

434
00:45:08,918 --> 00:45:09,899
Don't touch them.

435
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,508
- Watch out!

436
00:45:26,948 --> 00:45:27,847
- The doors!

437
00:45:28,865 --> 00:45:29,734
- The door!

438
00:45:50,235 --> 00:45:51,570
- You OK?
- Yeah.

439
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:53,707
Slab's gotta weigh two tons.

440
00:45:54,071 --> 00:45:55,398
We'll never move it.

441
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:40,259
What did you say this room was called?

442
00:46:41,934 --> 00:46:43,712
Sacrificial chamber.

443
00:46:59,968 --> 00:47:01,173
Can you hear me?

444
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:02,738
- Rousseau.
- Tommy, come in.

445
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:04,724
- Is there anything you didn't tell me?

446
00:47:04,851 --> 00:47:05,652
Nothing.

447
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:07,000
- Your guess is as good as mine.

448
00:47:07,276 --> 00:47:09,321
Whatever it is, we're not prepared.

449
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:12,897
We're gonna round up the rest of the team
and get to the surface. Let's move!

450
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,276
- What are you doing?

451
00:47:18,531 --> 00:47:19,739
- My job.

452
00:47:20,474 --> 00:47:21,566
Yours is over.

453
00:47:21,668 --> 00:47:24,951
My job is over when everyone
is back on the boat safely.

454
00:47:25,078 --> 00:47:27,049
And that gun doesn't change anything.

455
00:47:42,322 --> 00:47:44,533
This bearing should take us
back to the entrance.

456
00:47:44,886 --> 00:47:46,841
We'll regroup at the whaling station.

457
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:48,993
What about Thomas? Rousseau?

458
00:47:50,025 --> 00:47:51,516
- We'll find them on the way up.

459
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,580
- Max?

460
00:47:52,584 --> 00:47:54,711
Stone, Verheiden. Cover our backs.

461
00:47:55,225 --> 00:47:58,677
The heat bloom your satellite detected
makes more sense now.

462
00:47:58,712 --> 00:47:59,708
What do you mean?

463
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,221
A building this sophisticated
requires an energy source.

464
00:48:04,573 --> 00:48:06,185
I think that's what your satellite detected.

465
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:08,471
A power plant for this pyramid firing up.

466
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,369
- Preparing.

467
00:48:10,582 --> 00:48:12,579
- Preparing? For what?

468
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:14,121
Gentlemen?

469
00:49:42,702 --> 00:49:43,896
Keep close.

470
00:49:56,443 --> 00:49:59,061
- Recognise what's on their shoulders?
- Yeah.

471
00:50:03,328 --> 00:50:05,072
- We worshipped these things?

472
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,313
- According to this, we did.

473
00:50:07,722 --> 00:50:10,358
And the artefacts you removed from
the sarcophagus

474
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:12,750
seem to be their weapons.

475
00:50:16,966 --> 00:50:17,817
Let's keep moving.

476
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,814
Only another 200 yards to the entrance.

477
00:50:41,924 --> 00:50:42,710
Take cover.

478
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:43,729
Move!

479
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:45,082
Where's Stone?

480
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:50,133
Stone!

481
00:51:10,628 --> 00:51:12,339
The pyramid's shifting again.

482
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:21,873
The doors are closing.
Get out!

483
00:51:25,525 --> 00:51:26,436
Come on.

484
00:51:26,808 --> 00:51:28,230
OK. Let's go.

485
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,050
Let's go.

486
00:51:29,113 --> 00:51:30,084
Let's go.

487
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:32,859
Hey! Verheiden!

488
00:51:38,036 --> 00:51:39,678
Somebody!

489
00:51:40,116 --> 00:51:41,352
Run! Let's go!

490
00:52:07,348 --> 00:52:09,109
I hope that's son ** dead **.

491
00:52:09,396 --> 00:52:11,405
Didn't stop?
It's been slow?

492
00:52:11,406 --> 00:52:13,234
- Hey, *****.
- Inflickt(?)?

493
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:14,575
- ******.
- What?

494
00:52:15,756 --> 00:52:18,691
I'm not a soldier, but i think
you should calm down now.

495
00:52:18,692 --> 00:52:20,859
Really, we're not dead yet, ok.

496
00:52:21,774 --> 00:52:24,283
Well, thanks, professor.

497
00:52:25,945 --> 00:52:30,223
Actually, it's doctor
and you be uncomfortable, okey.

498
00:52:30,224 --> 00:52:31,847
What?

499
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:50,435
Hey! Can you hear me?

500
00:52:54,792 --> 00:52:56,884
It's Connors! Where are you?

501
00:53:32,738 --> 00:53:35,235
We're never getting
out of this place.

502
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:38,167
Have you got any children?

503
00:53:40,152 --> 00:53:41,179
- Got a son.

504
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,027
- Yeah, I've got two.

505
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:45,456
That means that we do not have
the luxury of quitting.

506
00:53:46,164 --> 00:53:47,496
We're gonna make it outta here.

507
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:52,886
We're surviving this if I have
to carry you the whole way.

508
00:54:00,872 --> 00:54:02,460
There's no way out back there.

509
00:54:07,169 --> 00:54:08,684
Not damaged.

510
00:54:13,002 --> 00:54:15,046
One of our men is dead.

511
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,956
I need to know what
this man died for.

512
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,324
He died trying to make(?) us.

513
00:54:34,737 --> 00:54:38,010
His... yours?

514
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:50,840
- What's that?

515
00:54:51,172 --> 00:54:52,338
- Just a theory.

516
00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:55,204
The Aztec calendar was metric.

517
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,277
Based on multiples of ten.

518
00:54:59,068 --> 00:55:02,190
I'm guessing the pyramid
reconfigures every ten minutes.

519
00:55:25,611 --> 00:55:27,028
Let's stick together.

520
00:55:32,402 --> 00:55:33,561
Weyland.

521
00:55:39,152 --> 00:55:42,021
It would seem that

522
00:55:42,386 --> 00:55:44,399
we are rats in a maze.

523
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:49,178
Soon(?).

524
00:56:27,457 --> 00:56:29,311
Connors? Connors!

525
00:56:44,742 --> 00:56:46,985
Verheiden? Verheiden?

526
00:56:47,325 --> 00:56:48,382
- Oh, God.
- Dr Miller!

527
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:50,825
Get me outta here!

528
00:56:50,956 --> 00:56:52,909
It's OK. I'm gonna find a way
to get down to you. OK?

529
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,167
Verheiden!

530
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,745
No!

531
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:22,384
You want a piece of me?

532
00:57:22,525 --> 00:57:24,900
You ugly son of a bitch!

533
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,183
Oh, God.

534
00:58:03,843 --> 00:58:04,751
Weyland.

535
00:58:10,681 --> 00:58:13,133
Leave it.
They can only slow us down.

536
00:58:13,168 --> 00:58:15,873
Too much has been lost
to leave here with nothing.

537
00:58:19,508 --> 00:58:20,722
Give it to me.

538
00:58:39,152 --> 00:58:39,900
Max.

539
00:58:45,432 --> 00:58:46,376
Hold on.

540
00:58:46,837 --> 00:58:47,656
Look out!

541
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,267
Come on. We have to get Weyland.

542
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:37,011
Weyland, come on.

543
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:17,899
What were they?

544
01:03:17,934 --> 01:03:19,702
- You tell me!
- You're the expert.

545
01:03:19,842 --> 01:03:20,762
I've got to stop. I've got to stop.

546
01:03:25,578 --> 01:03:26,447
Take it easy.

547
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,539
Weyland.

548
01:03:27,574 --> 01:03:28,830
Weyland, Look at me.

549
01:03:28,865 --> 01:03:29,777
Look at me.

550
01:03:30,204 --> 01:03:32,309
You have to slow your breathing down.

551
01:03:32,901 --> 01:03:35,171
Slow, steady breaths.

552
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:41,792
- Weyland, come on.

553
01:03:41,827 --> 01:03:43,133
- I can hardly stand.

554
01:03:43,168 --> 01:03:45,372
I'm not gonna let you die down here.

555
01:03:45,668 --> 01:03:46,710
You didn't.

556
01:03:48,396 --> 01:03:49,302
- There's another one.

557
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:51,208
We have to go.
Now!

558
01:03:51,763 --> 01:03:53,058
- Weyland.
- Come with us.

559
01:03:53,185 --> 01:03:55,474
- Get her outta here.
- Weyland.

560
01:03:55,603 --> 01:03:57,186
- Now!
- Come on.

561
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,027
Run!

562
01:04:28,356 --> 01:04:30,191
Don't turn your back on me.

563
01:04:45,326 --> 01:04:47,043
- Wait.
- This way.

564
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,692
- Weyland.

565
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:03,385
You can't hold them.

566
01:05:04,561 --> 01:05:05,721
We have to go.

567
01:05:06,098 --> 01:05:09,358
We keep it together,
we make it to the surface.

568
01:05:09,842 --> 01:05:13,196
Let's go.
Let's go.

569
01:05:18,259 --> 01:05:20,303
<i>We keep it together,
we make it to the surface.</i>

570
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:22,497
<i>We keep it together,
we make it to the surface.</i>

571
01:05:22,667 --> 01:05:23,716
<i>we make it to the surface.</i>

572
01:05:23,859 --> 01:05:24,991
We make it to the surface.

573
01:05:27,872 --> 01:05:28,975
Wait.

574
01:05:37,964 --> 01:05:39,288
This way.

575
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,933
Go! Go!

576
01:07:07,896 --> 01:07:09,138
Look over here.

577
01:07:37,908 --> 01:07:39,557
- He's marking himself.

578
01:07:39,776 --> 01:07:40,773
What?

579
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:45,064
Ancient warriors would mark themselves
with the blood of their kill.

580
01:07:46,087 --> 01:07:47,948
It's a rite of passage.

581
01:07:52,647 --> 01:07:54,665
This is starting to make sense.

582
01:08:03,174 --> 01:08:06,632
Think, This is a mental ritual.

583
01:08:08,034 --> 01:08:12,994
The humans had once...They have been
sendt here to prove their worthy,be adults

584
01:08:15,586 --> 01:08:17,025
You're saying they are, what?

585
01:08:18,935 --> 01:08:20,476
Teenagers?

586
01:08:24,522 --> 01:08:27,590
That's why they didn't carry
thoose guns with them.

587
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:28,967
They have to earn them.

588
01:08:42,469 --> 01:08:45,086
The hieroglyphs are
a little difficult to make out.

589
01:08:46,134 --> 01:08:48,141
But the story is all here.

590
01:08:49,872 --> 01:08:51,487
Thousands of years ago,

591
01:08:52,705 --> 01:08:55,526
these hunters found a backwater planet.

592
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:04,544
They taught humans how to build

593
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:07,932
and were worshipped as gods.

594
01:09:12,628 --> 01:09:15,913
Every hundred years the gods would return.

595
01:09:19,166 --> 01:09:20,705
And when they did,

596
01:09:21,484 --> 01:09:23,866
they would expect a sacrifice.

597
01:09:24,297 --> 01:09:25,974
Humans were used to breed

598
01:09:26,009 --> 01:09:27,455
the ultimate prey.

599
01:09:36,613 --> 01:09:39,854
The hunters would battle
with these great serpents

600
01:09:39,889 --> 01:09:43,441
to prove themselves worthy
to carry the mark.

601
01:10:00,752 --> 01:10:02,350
But if the hunters lost,

602
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:05,687
they made sure nothing survived.

603
01:10:10,681 --> 01:10:13,444
An entire civilisation wiped out overnight.

604
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:21,424
So...
the humanoids, the hunters -

605
01:10:22,826 --> 01:10:25,041
they brought those creatures here to hunt?

606
01:10:25,076 --> 01:10:26,888
And they use us like cattle.

607
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:30,424
We're hosts for them to breed in.

608
01:10:31,233 --> 01:10:34,003
The heat bloom was the sign
to lure us down here.

609
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:36,468
This whole thing was a trap.

610
01:10:38,403 --> 01:10:39,437
Without us,

611
01:10:39,472 --> 01:10:41,291
there could be no hunt.

612
01:11:11,744 --> 01:11:13,430
Verheiden!

613
01:11:54,448 --> 01:11:56,125
Oh, shit.

614
01:12:00,887 --> 01:12:02,178
When that door opens,

615
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:03,679
we're dead.

616
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:05,903
- Not if we set things right.

617
01:12:06,309 --> 01:12:07,209
- What do you mean?

618
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:08,466
This pyramid

619
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:10,403
is like a prison.

620
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,056
We took the guards' guns,

621
01:12:13,091 --> 01:12:15,182
and now the prisoners are running free.

622
01:12:15,568 --> 01:12:18,576
To restore order, the guards need their guns.

623
01:12:20,668 --> 01:12:21,839
When that door opens,

624
01:12:23,597 --> 01:12:25,279
we're gonna give that thing his gun back.

625
01:12:25,682 --> 01:12:26,634
Are you crazy?

626
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:29,231
During a big-game hunt,
the animals being hunted

627
01:12:29,381 --> 01:12:30,456
don't arm the hunters.

628
01:12:30,491 --> 01:12:31,843
They're not hunting us.

629
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:34,055
We're in the middle of a war.

630
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:36,864
- It's time to pick a side.
- We are on our side.

631
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:42,651
We have to consider the possibility
that we might not make it out of here.

632
01:12:46,026 --> 01:12:47,493
But we have to make sure

633
01:12:47,528 --> 01:12:50,463
those serpents don't reach the surface.

634
01:12:51,177 --> 01:12:52,162
Because if they do,

635
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,582
everything everywhere could die.

636
01:13:00,606 --> 01:13:02,238
The enemy of my enemy...

637
01:13:03,815 --> 01:13:05,015
is my friend.

638
01:13:28,794 --> 01:13:30,731
Let's go find our friend.

639
01:13:41,241 --> 01:13:43,804
How do you say "scared shitless" in Italian?

640
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:50,221
More or less.

641
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:39,833
Lex.

642
01:14:43,728 --> 01:14:44,710
Hold on.

643
01:14:45,921 --> 01:14:47,291
Come on, Lex.

644
01:16:50,414 --> 01:16:51,988
Wait. Wait.

645
01:16:52,023 --> 01:16:53,009
Please, wait.

646
01:16:57,358 --> 01:17:00,281
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

647
01:19:04,285 --> 01:19:08,674
I'm coming with you.
You hear me, you ugly creature?

648
01:20:03,403 --> 01:20:05,777
What are you doing?

649
01:22:30,475 --> 01:22:32,071
Miller!

650
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,987
Miller!

651
01:23:33,324 --> 01:23:35,338
Sebastian.

652
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:36,854
- Help me, Lex.

653
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,233
- I'm gonna get you out of there.

654
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:39,404
- It's too late.

655
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:41,896
It's inside me.
- I'm gonna get you outta here.

656
01:23:41,932 --> 01:23:42,640
- You can't...

657
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:45,036
No. No. No! No!

658
01:23:46,936 --> 01:23:48,667
I have to help him.

659
01:23:53,035 --> 01:23:54,106
Lex!

660
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:56,984
They mustn't reach the surface.

661
01:23:57,667 --> 01:24:00,083
They mustn't reach the surface.

662
01:24:00,748 --> 01:24:01,745
I know.

663
01:24:11,274 --> 01:24:12,350
Do it!

664
01:24:17,823 --> 01:24:18,786
I'm sorry.

665
01:25:38,987 --> 01:25:40,708
It's a bomb.

666
01:25:41,065 --> 01:25:43,763
Well, I hope it kills every fucking one of 'em.

667
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:32,180

668
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:01,330
Got it!
