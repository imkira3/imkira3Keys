Who asked you, Breakfast?

363
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,242
Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue:

364
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,537
If you're going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

- Let's spin him.

the Golden Goose.

401

Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

402
00:24:55,745 --> 00:25:00,709
Just one of her golden eggs...

It's my destiny, Puss.

This is kind of a solo dream here.

491
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,281
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this.

492
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,658
Here, look. We need to think bigger.

493
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,577
I've been casing the silversmith
and it's perfect.

494
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,205
You and me, in and out, 50 seconds tops.

495
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:52,000
Will you put that away!
This is our home.

496
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,794
These people have done nothing to us.

497
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:58,423
Our home? OK, yeah, I get it now.

498
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:02,010
You get some fancy boots
and now you're too good for me?

499
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,553
That is not true.

500
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,805
We weren't born here. We're orphans!

501
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,765
All we got is each other,
you understand?

502
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,559
We are better than this.

503
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,478
But we're partners.

504
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,689
We are brothers.

505
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,151
But I am not stealing any more.

[yowls]
[Humpty] I'm in trouble, Puss!

508
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,660
It's Boy Blue and his gang.
I owe them some money.

509
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:29,954
They're coming for me.
Just get me over this wall.

510
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:33,916
I gotta go. Help me up the wall.
Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

511
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,511
[distant whistle blowing]

512
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,972
OK, I've got everything.
We did it. Come on, let's go!

513
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:49,640
How could you do this to me?!

514
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,268
I did you a favor!
We can finally get out of here!

515
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,063
This is the money of the people!
This is all they have!

516
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:56,731
[Puss yowls] [groans]

00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:01,652
[gasps] You disgrace those boots!

518
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,696
Comandante, please, I can explain!

519
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:04,947
Arrest them!

520
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,617
- Hiyah!
[whinnies]

521
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,371
[Humpty] Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

522
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,415
- You tricked me!
- I had to! You left me no choice!

Oh! Oof!

529
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,699
- Oh, no.
[Humpty] Puss. I can't get up.

530
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,993
Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

531
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,578
Freeze!

532
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,081
Puss, save me!

533
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:57,208
Save yourself.

534
00:31:58,418 --> 00:31:59,585
[guard] We got you.

the disappointment in my mama's eyes.</i>

00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:34,370
And I have been running ever since.

541
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:41,377
The egg betrayed me.

542
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:46,424
- His lies cost me everything.

[Humpty] You think
I don't want to fix the past?

545
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,018
I can't get down.

Listen. A day... A day doesn't go by

549
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,325
when I don't think about what I lost.

550
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:17,038
I lost my best friend.

551
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:20,208
My only friend. And I get it now.

552
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,585
I got greedy and desperate
and I let you down.

553
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,795
I let myself down.

554
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,465
All I'm asking for, Puss,
is a second chance.

555
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:31,594
Give me that second chance
and I'll help you pay back San Ricardo.

[sighs] Please, Puss.

557

Let me show you

- I will do it.
- Oh, that's great.

560
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:50,446
I will do this for my mother
and for San Ricardo... not for you.

561
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,991
We are not partners
and we are not friends.

OK. I promise this time,
I will not let you down.

Don't screw it up.

- What?
- Again with the mask?

571

- Trust me.

00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,770
[squealing]

650
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,650
[yelling] [squealing]

651
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,568
[both] Humpty!

652
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,446
[screaming]

653
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:43,531
[both gasp]

654
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:47,660
- We're going to die!
[whinnies]

655
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:52,456
[shouts echoing]

656
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:02,258
- I hate cats.
- This is war!

657
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:08,347
[cheering, laughter echoing]

658
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,808
[laughter]

659
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,643
Giant's castle...

660
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,812
here we come.

661
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,817
[Puss sighs] I must hand it to the egg.

662
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:22,778
This was a team effort.
Humpty still has his claws...

663
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:26,115
I mean, flaws.
That was what I meant, not claws.

664
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,284
He's not a cat. [chuckles nervously]

665
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,328
- Not to say there's anything wrong...
- I don't want to talk about it.

666
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:32,872
Got it.

667
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,916
[muttering] OK, we should be close!

668
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:39,211
Keep your eyes out
for any strange cloud activity!

669
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:43,090
I am called Kitty Softpaws
because I'll steal you blind

670
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:45,551
and you'll never even know I was there.

671
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,720

[groans]

673
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:52,892
Kitty?

674
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,186
You are not as good as they say.

675
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,190
You're better.

676
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:05,821
I will respect your privacy.

677
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,953
[Kitty sighs] OK. I'll tell you.

678
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,748
I was just a stray...

679
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:18,584
but I had beautiful claws.

680
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,631
One day,
a really nice couple took me in.

681
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,133
Gave me milk every morning.

682
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,635
Loved me.

683
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:34,475
Maybe I scratched their curtains
or played too rough with the hamster.

684
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,977
I don't know why they did it.

685
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,688
But they took my claws.

686
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:45,402
- Cat people are crazy.
[chuckles]

687
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,321
Stop the coach! I think this is it!

688
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:57,373
[shrieks] Ooh! Whoo!

691
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:09,635
Can you believe this, Puss?

692
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:12,554
After all these years!

693
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:17,226
Here. I want you to plant them.

694
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:25,317
That... is a strange cloud.

695
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,944
[gasps]

696
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:31,824
[Humpty] Whoa! OK! This is it!
It's happening, hurry!

697
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,036
This Way!

698
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,288
Good, good.
Come on, come on, come on.

699
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,708
Twenty-three divided by cloud depth.

700
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,543
Hole! Right here.

701
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:47,089
Now place the beans.

702
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,093
[gasps]
Place the beans carefully, please.

703
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,430
Not on top of each other.
The magic is very delicate.

704
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:58,559
OK, good. Very good
Now just stand back.

Whoa! [shrieks]

712
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:43,228
What's happening here?

713
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,189
Maybe the magic rubbed off
in your pocket?

714
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,567
- That's impossible.
- OK, OK. Let's not panic.

715
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,778
You know, I read somewhere
that plants have feelings.

716
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:54,656
So, come on...
say something nice to it.

717
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:55,908
OK.

718
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,577
Let me just think for a second.

719
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:00,412
Hi, little plant.

720
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:01,580

00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:25,706
[both in high-pitched voices] Humpty!

734
00:44:25,873 --> 00:44:28,876
- I do not see him. Do you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

735
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,253
You sound weird.

736
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,381
Ah! It's the thin air!

737
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,178
Come on in! It feels great!

[cheering]

00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:48,520
- The cloud, it tickles my nose.
[Humpty] Hoo-hoo!

740
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:52,191
That's because they effervesce!
Who knew? Ho-ho!

Hey, Puss.
What do you think? Do I shave?

00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:28,810
[chuckles]

754
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:30,604
Let me show you something.

755
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:40,030
Somewhere down there,
there are two little kids,

756
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:42,324
I don't know, maybe orphans,

757
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:45,410
and they're laying on a hill,
staring at the clouds,

758
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,329
dreaming about the future.

759
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,165
That was me and you, Puss.

760
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,834
Me and you.

761
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:55,963
[Kitty] Boys!

762
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:59,091
You might want to take a look at this.

763
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:05,305
[Humpty] The giant's castle.

[gasps, chuckles]

765
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:10,560
OK, time to suit up.

766
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:11,770
Humpty!

767
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:14,106
[Humpty] I'll fit right in
with the golden eggs.

768
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:15,357
[groans]

769
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,820
Brilliant or what, huh?

770
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:23,532
Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

771
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:26,201
What? Are you embarrassed?

772
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:27,619
I'm not.

773
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,374
[chuckles] Puss, remember when
everyone was laughing at Bean Club?

774
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:35,544
[Puss] And who is laughing now?
Ha-ha! We are!

775
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,223
Wow!

[cloud thunks]

777
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:03,572
[Humpty in normal voice]
That is our target.

778
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,907
[in normal voice] Hey, you don't
sound like an elf any more.

779
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,784
It's because the air pressure
in here is normal.

780
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:08,952
Let's go.

781
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:16,626
So here is the plan: You two get
the golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

782
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:19,546
There's no giant to fight.
The giant's been dead for years.

783
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:21,965
- What?!
- You didn't do the reading, did you?

- Wha... What was that?
- They call it the Great Terror.

788
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,937
It's the monster that guards
the Golden Goose.

789
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:38,607
Legend has it that if you look at it,
you'll turn to stone.

790
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:42,319
But nobody really knows because
nobody's walked away from it alive.

791
00:47:42,486 --> 00:47:44,404

I can't help it.

00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:00,545

Hide!

[Humpty gasping, muttering]

- Shh! Humpty! Be quiet!
- I'm hyperventilating!

820
00:49:25,297 --> 00:49:28,884
[muffled] I said I couldn't breathe and
then you zipped the thing over my mouth!

821
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,471
Shh! Hey. You gotta
get it together. Come on!

822
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:33,889
OK.

[Humpty] Look at this.
It's egg paradise.

827
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:56,786
It's so beautiful,
I feel like I belong here.

Grab as many as you can.

833
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:13,053
[grunting] I thought they were
going to be like chicken size.

834
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,432
Can you imagine laying
one of these? Ouch!

835
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,102
- Puss! Ow!
[grunting]

836
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,480
How are we supposed to get
these out of here?

837
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:25,023

[whispering] Let's just take her.

850
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:02,602
Wait a minute.
This is the goose of legend.

[roaring]

853

I know what happens
if we don't take her, we got nothing.

854

Guys, guys. It's a gold peeper.

No! It's not supposed to be this way!

Uh... I'm sorry. [chuckles]

Hmm.

- Did you hear that?

00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:16,379
I think he just called me Daddy.

There is one word for you,
Kitty Softpaws: Me-wow!

924
00:55:30,203 --> 00:55:32,622
I know you have quite
a reputation with the ladies,

925
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:35,124
Mr. Friskie Two-Times.

But that was before I met you.

929
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:43,967
You don't know me, Puss.

930
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:47,762
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm all about the score.

931
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:49,973
Come on. Look me in the eyes

932
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:52,851
and tell me all you
care about is the gold.

for his animal magnetism.

938
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:06,531
You stay focused.

[rhythmic clanking]

942
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:20,628
[clears throat] So... I have
been thinking, Miss Softpaws,

943
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:24,591
that when we go our separate ways,
we can go our separate ways...

944
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:26,259
together.

945
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:30,513
Puss, you have to go, now.

946
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,099
You do not have to push me away any more.

947
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:35,226
- You can trust me.
- But...

948
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:37,145
Give it up for the legends
of San Ricardo,

949
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:39,606
Humpty and Puss! We did it!

No, I feel a... [coughs]

953
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,994
OK, yeah.
Have fun with that!

954
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:55,204
We should give her some privacy.

955
00:56:57,707 --> 00:57:00,251
I never thought we would get to here.

956
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,880
After all we went through...

957
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:06,382
to pull this off, together.

958
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:10,595
It is good to have my brother back.

959
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,265
Yep. Sure is.

960
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:16,935
[yawns] Well, we have
a big day tomorrow.

961
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:20,188
[grunts] Pretty exciting stuff.

962
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:21,731
We should get some rest.

963
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:26,611

I will find you.

[grunting]

983
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,437
Be gone!

984
00:59:26,022 --> 00:59:29,484
[Humpty] What do you want?
Gold? I have gold!

985
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,487
[Jill laughs]
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

986
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,280
[Jack chuckling] With our own gold.

987
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:36,407
[Jill] Come on now, all we want
is a little breakfast.

988
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:37,742
[Humpty] No, no, please!

989
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:39,577
[Jack] How do you like
your eggs, pumpkin?

990
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:41,162
Humpty, no!

[sighs] Hello, Puss.

994
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,880
[all] Surprise!

995
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:53,007
[laughing]

996
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,134
What is going on?

997
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:59,305
It's a surprise party,
and the surprise is on you.

998
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:02,058
Looks like the cat's out of the bag.

999
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:03,684
You were in cahoots?!

1000
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:06,312
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

1001
01:00:09,357 --> 01:00:13,528
I spent a lot of time in prison
preparing for this.

1002
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,531
- You set me up.
- Oh, yeah, I set you up. Of course.

1003
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:21,035
You think this was all about getting
the gold and clearing your name?

1004
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:25,665
This little adventure
was about one thing.

1005
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:27,959
Revenge.

1006
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:35,133
You never knew it, Puss...
but I was always there. [echoing]

1007
01:00:55,236 --> 01:00:59,031
You wanted to repay an old debt, Puss?
Well, so did I.

1008
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:02,118
- Why would you do this?
- You left me on that bridge!

1009
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:04,370
You abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

1010
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:07,165
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!
- I trusted you!

1011
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,417
Well, now you're finally
gonna know what it feels like,

1012
01:01:09,584 --> 01:01:12,336
you know, to trust someone
and have them stab you in the back.

1013
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:14,297
Guards!

1014
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:19,260
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest
for the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

1015
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:21,429
Consider this the final
meeting of Bean Club.

1016
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:24,182
- I should scramble you with onions!
[shrieks]

1017
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,767
You should never have come back.

1018
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:31,355
[growls]
[lmelda] Pequeño! Wait.

1019
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:33,649
Do not fight them, please.

1020
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:36,611
Mama! Listen to me. I can explain.

1021
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:41,199
No. Puss, no more running.

1022
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:45,494
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

1023
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:50,291
I'm sorry, Mama.

1024
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,044
I let you down.

1025
01:01:55,922 --> 01:01:57,924
Paws where we can see them!

1026
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:01,093
Turn around... slow.

1027
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:04,764
Slower!

1028
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:14,523
Step into the carrier... quiet-like.

1029
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:23,908
Attention! Attention, everyone!

1030
01:02:24,075 --> 01:02:26,285
If you could just come in
a little closer.

1031
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:27,995
Ladies and gentlemen,

1032
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:31,499
I present to you...
the Golden Goose of legend!

1033

[peeping]
[crowd gasping, chattering]

1034
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,632
Kitty. Not you, too?

1035
01:02:44,262 --> 01:02:46,847
[Humpty laughs] Gold for everyone!

1036
01:02:47,014 --> 01:02:49,433
Boo! Boo! Boo! [cackles]

1037
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,228
We got some fresh,
hot gold here, people!

1038
01:02:52,395 --> 01:02:56,691
Step right up! Get it hot!

1039
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:59,193
<i>[crowd] Huevos! Huevos! Huevos!</i>

1040
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:08,619
One hat.

1041
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:10,913
One belt.

1042
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,332
And two boots...

1043
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:16,294
once a symbol of honor.

1044
01:03:17,962 --> 01:03:20,256
One bottle of catnip?

1045
01:03:20,423 --> 01:03:23,426
Uh... it is for my glaucoma.

1046
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:26,554
[yowls] [door slams]

1047
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:30,599
This is where you belong, outlaw.

1048
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:35,479
And this is
where you will stay... forever.

1049
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:42,528
[sighs]

1050
01:03:50,286 --> 01:03:52,455
[man] Whoo-hoo!
[shrieks]

1051
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,541
No, no. Don't stop on my account.

1052
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:11,766
Well, it looks like the egg
got what he wanted.

1053
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,726
You're talking about Humpty?

1054
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:15,478
[babbles] Don't say his name!

1055
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:19,231
I used to share this cell
with that smelly thing.

1056
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:22,443
Happiest day of my life was
when he left.

1057
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:25,196
Till I realized he stole my magic beans.

1058
01:04:25,363 --> 01:04:28,407
Wait, wait, wait!
You had the beans? Who are you?

1059
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:31,452
[snores]
- Hey! What's your name?

1060
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:34,163
[screams] Andy Beanstalk!

1061
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:36,248
My friends call me Jack.

1062
01:04:36,415 --> 01:04:39,627
I traded the family cow for them beans.

1063
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:41,629
Course'n, it wasn't my family's cow.

1064
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:44,799
It was some other family's family cow.
That's why I got eight to ten.

1065
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:49,053
Always know which cow is yours.

1066
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,514
[snores]
- Crazy man. Wake up!

1067
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,266
[gasps]
- What else do you know?

1068
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:58,354
We're all goners,
thanks to that little stinky!

1069
01:04:58,521 --> 01:05:03,567
I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge!

1070
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:05,945
Don't take the goose. Why?

1071
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:08,072
[Shores] [groans]

1072
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:13,452
[gasps] The Great Terror!
That's the Golden Goose's mama.

1073
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:14,870
Oh, no.

1074
01:05:15,037 --> 01:05:17,706
And she will be out for blood

1075
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:21,377
when she comes back for her baby.

1076
01:05:21,544 --> 01:05:22,962
[gasps] Guard!

1077
01:05:23,129 --> 01:05:26,215
San Ricardo is in terrible danger!
You must listen to me!

1078
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:27,383
Quiet, you!

[yowling continuing]

1081
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:53,325
[groans] Shut up.

1082
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:58,456
[yowling] [groans angrily]

1083
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:04,670
- Shh!

[purring] [gasps]

1085
01:06:10,593 --> 01:06:13,095
Open the door.

1086
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,062
Drop the weapon.

1087
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,191
Very good.

1088
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,526
Step aside.

1089
01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:29,862
No. [grunts]

1090
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:31,655
- Diablo Gato!
[gasps]

1091
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:34,658
Nice try. [snickers]

[muffled scream]

1093
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,580
Huh?

1094
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:48,547
I hope you can forgive me.

1095
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:51,175
Apology accepted!

1096
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:54,553
I don't really have time for you.

1097
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,805
I have to save the town
from the Great Terror!

1098
01:06:56,972 --> 01:06:58,849
Wait, Puss!

1099
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:01,018
Don't you see? I'm here because...

1100
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:04,522
I am here because you made me realize

1101
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:08,234
that there is something
I care about more than gold.

1102
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:10,653
Something?

1103
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,989
OK. Someone.

1104
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:16,700
He's about two feet tall,
wears high heels.

1105
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,327
Handsome?

1106
01:07:18,494 --> 01:07:20,496
He's very handsome.

1107
01:07:20,663 --> 01:07:22,581
- A real beefcake?
- Mm-hm.

1108
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:24,041
- A stallion?
- Yes.

1109
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:25,960
- Tiger?
- Oh, brother.

1110
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:29,213
[chuckles] But this
does not make us even.

1111
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:32,466
- Freeze!
- Yes, it does.

1112
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:34,426
- No, no, no, it doesn't.

I saved you!

1116
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,184
You owed me one.

1117
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,812
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

1118
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:48,524
So now you owe me two.

1119

[guards shouting]

1120
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:55,823

Ha-ha!

You are not getting away, Puss In Boots!

1123

Wrong boots.

Now we're even! [yowls]

This is your San Ricardo weather report.

Chances of a giant goose

Let's, uh, get out of here
before Mama shows up.
