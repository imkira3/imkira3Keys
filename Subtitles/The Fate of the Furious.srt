2
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,320
- No way!
- Yeah.

3
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,480
This is the Cuban spirit.

4
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,790
Dom. Dom.

5
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,976
You know I can't
make a living without my car.

6
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,558
Not my problem, bro.

7
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,235
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.

8
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,840
Why you hookin' up
my cousin's car?

9
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,352
He needed money,
I gave it to him.

10
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,590
He can't pay,
I take the car.

11
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,760
I just need
a few more days.

12
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,400
"Few more days"
wasn't part of the deal.

13
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,351
Come on. You make a deal,
you gotta live up to it.

14
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,000
You make a deal,
you gonna live up to it.

15
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,319
"Gonna" live up to it?

16
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,112
Oh, so you're
one of those types.

17
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,753
You take everyone's ride,
and then ship it back to the States?

18
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,456
You watch your mouth.

19
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,074
Now you got a problem.

20
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,038
I'm gonna keep it
about the cars.

21
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,136
You want a car,
get it the right way.

22
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
How?

23
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,874
Race for it.

24
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,071
I already own it, bro.

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,433
Not that car.

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,991
Mine.

27
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,193
Dom, his car is the fastest
car on the island.

28
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,040
Do you know what
he has under that hood?

29
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,435
He knows it doesn't matter
what's under a hood.

30
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,278
The only thing that matters
is who's behind the wheel.

31
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,429
You think so?

32
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,954
I know so.

33
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,992
Then race his car.

34
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,514
And we ain't racing
no quarter-mile, here.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,479
We race the Cuban mile.

36
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,109
Done.

37
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,036
I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

38
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,511
but my car is the slowest
car on the island.

39
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,828
Was.

40
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,711
Pull the seats,
the doors, the battery...

41
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,350
If it ain't the motor,
take it off.

42
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,355
Laughing gas?

43
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,711
Nah, Fed.
This is Cuban NOS.

44
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,634
You guys are crazy.

45
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,789
What are you doing?

46
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,509
Poor man's turbo.
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.

47
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,838
Old trick that Buster used to play,
in case of emergencies.

48
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,835
You know that's way too
much boost for that engine.

49
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,195
It's gonna be fast.

50
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,595
It's gonna be a bomb.

51
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,518
Only needs to go a mile.

52
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,754
Vámonos!

53
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,909
That car belongs
in the trash, bro!

54
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,656
Where are they going?

55
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,874
I don't know.
Let's go!

56
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Ghost him.

57
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,396
Sí.

58
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,672
Adiós, Toretto!

59
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,039
Okay, Buster.

60
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,153
Let's see if this works.

61
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,274
That's impossible.

62
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,555
Look out!

63
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,755
A deal's a deal.

64
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,589
You won my car.

65
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,398
And you earned
my respect.

66
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,593
Keep your car.

67
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,392
Your respect is
good enough for me.

68
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,114
Yo, cousin...

69
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,833
Sorry about your car.

70
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,434
Yours was too slow
for a Toretto, anyway.

71
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,193
Your Impala?
Are you serious?

72
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,793
Look at that smile.

73
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,958
I love it
when you smile.

74
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,314
You make me happy.

75
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,628
Mmm, I think this place
makes you happy.

76
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,479
It's like
it speaks to you.

77
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,356
You remember that guy,
the racer and his dad?

78
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,776
The one with the boat
engine under the hood?

79
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Yeah!

80
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,552
Yes.
Of course.

81
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,552
I was looking at them,
and I...

82
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,599
And I couldn't help
but to imagine

83
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,319
what you'd be like
if you were a dad.

84
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,909
No, no, no!
I'm not pregnant.

85
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,195
Is that what you want?

86
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,629
It's not about what I
want or what you want.

87
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,039
It's about why we haven't
asked the question.

88
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,712
What?
You need a hand?

89
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,234
Yeah, I think I do.

90
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,310
Sounds like you're
not getting any fuel. Yeah?

91
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,311
Probably the shut-off solenoid.

92
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,320
Let's see if we can
get some power to it.

93
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,359
What brings you
to Cuba?

94
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,190
The same thing that brings
everyone else to Cuba.

95
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,674
Culture, people,
the beauty.

96
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,753
What brings you
to Cuba?

97
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,635
Work.
Must be casual Friday.

98
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,913
How's that honeymoon
going, Dom?

99
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,671
Your fuel relay
is missing.

100
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,119
I know.

101
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,352
I love to play games.

102
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,998
I've beaten
the best of 'em.

103
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,456
But I'm kind of in a rush,
so if you've got something to say to me...

104
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,869
Oh, this is a very different game,
that I can assure you.

105
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,192
This... There's something
much greater at work here.

106
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This is fate.

107
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,318
I choose
to make my own fate.

108
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,953
Not today.

109
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,632
Is this the road you take to
your apartment every morning?

110
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,792
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?

111
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,096
Did you have to cross two blocks
to go get your Cuban coffees?

112
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,429
What is it, black,
no sugar?

113
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,909
Yeah.

114
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,389
I put a lot of work into
getting you here today.

115
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,960
Well, now that I'm here,
what do you want?

116
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,634
I want you to work for me.

117
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Work for you?

118
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,995
Oh, I could've saved you
a lot of time, then.

119
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,793
See, I don't work
for anyone.

120
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,351
You can't walk away
from this, Dom.

121
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,954
We're gonna have this conversation,
one way or the other.

122
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,151
You see, that's the
funny thing about fate.

123
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,189
It's cunning.

124
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,160
It can bring you
beautiful things,

125
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,390
and it can also bring
you moments like this.

126
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,715
Oh, you're gonna want
to work for me.

127
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,839
You're gonna betray
your brothers,

128
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,559
abandon your code,
and shatter your family.

129
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,111
You see, your team is about to go up
against the only thing they can't handle.

130
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
What's that?

131
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,439
You.

132
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,718
Oh, and, Dom, I wouldn't
mention this to anyone.

133
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,357
They are gonna be hitting us
with everything they got.

134
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,636
So we wanna engage
with maximum speed.

135
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,076
Neutralize their shooters,
and then move on to our objective.

136
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,316
There's two things
I want you to keep in mind.

137
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,914
Number one,
I chose you for this squad

138
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,834
because you are the most
fearsome warriors on the planet.

139
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,990
And number two,
you go out there,

140
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,799
you do your job,
and you take 'em down.

141
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,115
Everyone.
And I mean everyone.

142
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,753
Mani's and pedi's
at the mall later on today.

143
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Huh?

144
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,913
Monarchs!

145
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
What?

146
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,553
I don't wanna
play anymore.

147
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,216
All right, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go!

148
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
Final two minutes.

149
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
Quite
the cheering section.

150
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Oh, yeah.

151
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,600
Yeah, it's the moms.
They come out to support the kids.

152
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,035
Except there seem to be
more moms than kids.

153
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,595
Way more moms.

154
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,675
Yeah.
It's a big soccer town.

155
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,229
Let's go, girls!

156
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,158
So, your intel
was spot-on.

157
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,749
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon
that went missing in the Gulf?

158
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,713
Arms dealers from the Liberation
Front have it in Berlin.

159
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
Shit!

160
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,718
This thing can wipe out an entire
electrical grid in a major city.

161
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,199
No lights, no power.

162
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,395
Instant Stone Age.

163
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,750
Chloe, Maya, you can't let
her run by you like that.

164
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,997
Let's go, let's go! Cross!
Agent Hobbs, this is a Class Four WMD.

165
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,496
Do you have any idea
what's at stake here?

166
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,193
Yes, I know exactly
what is at stake here, okay?

167
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,629
If the Pink Butterflies
beat my Red Dragons,

168
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,120
that means we lose
the championship.

169
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,336
Which means
I have 20 little girls

170
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,237
who are crying,
and that's not a good thing.

171
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,118
Which then means I have to spend
a lot of time in ice-cream shops

172
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,918
and a lot of time
at Tay Tay concerts.

173
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,515
Tay Tay?

174
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,030
Taylor Swift. Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?

175
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Let's go, girls!

176
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,635
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.

177
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,360
All right, but I need
to be clear here.

178
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,359
The US government cannot sanction
this operation in any way.

179
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,789
You're on your own.
Hey.

180
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,349
If this thing goes sideways,
you don't just get burned.

181
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,754
You go to prison.

182
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,231
And there's nothing
we can do to get you out.

183
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,555
Let me tell you
something.

184
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,034
The only thing that I love more
than saving lives is my daughter.

185
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,073
So, if you don't shut up with this
government bullshit right now,

186
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,356
and start showing
some team spirit

187
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,874
and respect
for the Red Dragons,

188
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,710
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up
and kick you right in the tay-tay.

189
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,069
Go Dragons!

190
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,195
Say it again.

191
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,554
Go Dragons!

192
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,671
Attaboy. Go Dragons.

193
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,234
Go Dragons.

194
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,675
I'm open.
She's open! Go, go!

195
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,394
Yes!

196
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,511
That is my daughter
right there. Yes.

197
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,793
Yes, come here.

198
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
How did I do?

199
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
Awesome.

200
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Nice job, kid.

201
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,632
Daddy's gotta go to work?

202
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,275
Uh, yeah.
Daddy's gotta go to work.

203
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Now, you're gonna need
to get a team you can trust.

204
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,079
Oh, I already got one.

205
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Hey, Dom.

206
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Hey, Hobbs.

207
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,916
I got a job in Berlin and
I need a favor, brother.

208
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,759
No problem. I'll grab the
team and meet you in Berlin.

209
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,311
Thanks, man.
I'll see you soon.

210
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,400
You were only supposed
to create a diversion, Roman.

211
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,589
That was a diversion!

212
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,400
How many of the damn
explosives did you use?

213
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,034
I don't know, Tej.

214
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,673
All of it?
Wait, all of it?

215
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,717
Roman, Jesus Christ.

216
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,512
We got more of
your fan club ahead.

217
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,035
They're still on us!

218
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,240
These guys are
taking this personal.

219
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,592
Roman, we just blew up their
facility and stole their EMP.

220
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,477
Other than
your doctor's cold finger,

221
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,437
I'd say it's about as
personal as it can get.

222
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,995
Phase Two!

223
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,719
Phase Two? So you just gonna
keep that to yourself?

224
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,440
What happened to Phase One?
What about that part?

225
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,039
Yeah.
Remember the airplane?

226
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,680
Everyone drove
their cars out but you?

227
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,951
I told you,
my engine seized up.

228
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
It's your balls
that seized up.

229
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,594
Just follow my lead, okay?

230
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,149
And, Roman,
whatever you do, don't think.

231
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Huh?

232
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,949
Tej, drop it!

233
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,675
Bombs away.

234
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,755
Split, now!

235
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,388
Holy...

236
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,239
Great plan, Tej.

237
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,676
But just so you know,
you missed some.

238
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,399
Oh, just wait for it.

239
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,071
Oh, shit!

240
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,989
I hate you, Tej!

241
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,349
Got your ass.

242
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,669
You good?

243
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,519
I'll see you
when it's done.

244
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,835
All right, great job, team.

245
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,800
Let's break off and meet
me at the safe house.

246
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
A hell of a job, brother.

247
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,956
When we get back to the base,
the beer's on me.

248
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,957
You lost your goddamn mind,
Toretto?

249
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,278
Toretto, you put
hands on that thing,

250
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,999
you're gonna have the whole world
gunning for you, including me.

251
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,274
I don't know
what you're doing,

252
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,078
but you better think
about this, Toretto.

253
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,718
It ain't too late
to stop this.

254
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,519
It is now.

255
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,716
That sumbitch just crossed us.

256
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,110
What? Wait a second,
what are you talking about?

257
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Dom took the EMP.

258
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,395
Bullshit.

259
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
Where are you?

260
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,016
It's too late for me.
Get outta here.

261
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,792
Saw that look in his eye,

262
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,757
and I've seen
that look before.

263
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,716
Dominic Toretto
just went rogue.

264
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,796
All right, I got
his phone records, y'all.

265
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,315
It's a whole bunch of calls
to untraceable numbers.

266
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,640
Burner phones, right?

267
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,948
Nah, scrambler.

268
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,416
Same number,
but they got some sort of

269
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,158
micro-router
to bury the signal path,

270
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,108
which means Dom is clearly communicating
with somebody that's above our pay grade.

271
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,078
Look, I don't know
Dom as well as you,

272
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,311
but if we just
look at the facts,

273
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,474
Dom's been having highly
encrypted conversations

274
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,039
with some mysterious person.

275
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,153
He took out Hobbs.

276
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,472
He stole an EMP.
Now he's disappeared.

277
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,509
So, what are you saying?

278
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,592
Maybe we should consider
the fact that Hobbs is right.

279
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,514
Dom did go rogue.

280
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Letty.

281
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,037
Before
you judge the man,

282
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,272
remember, you're breathing right
now because he saved your life.

283
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,680
You just gonna let her bump
your shoulder like that?

284
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,591
I'm just saying,
that was a little aggressive.

285
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,120
What you gonna do,
email her?

286
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,595
Check.

287
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,835
Moment,
will you, fellas?

288
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,554
Thank you.

289
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,199
Well, this is
an exciting new look.

290
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,875
It's a little tight in
the crotch, as always.

291
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,276
What boy-band bus
did she fall out of?

292
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,279
It's my new
junior associate.

293
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,351
He's working with me on this.
All yours.

294
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,201
Mr. Nobody and I have been given the
authority to get you out of this.

295
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,238
All you have to do is agree
to the terms and you're free.

296
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,360
What's training wheels
talking about? What terms?

297
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,472
Confess to your crimes
in Berlin.

298
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,797
Treason,
international espionage,

299
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,791
massive destruction
of civic property.

300
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,632
You do that,
we close the case.

301
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,235
And?
And the DSS blacklists you.

302
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,719
Germany loves that.

303
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,496
Officially,
you will be a criminal.

304
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,576
Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

305
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,360
You need to work on your
delivery, all right?

306
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,913
Unofficially...

307
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,914
You're off the books.
You come work with me.

308
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
I'm not a criminal.

309
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,113
Luke,
come on. Labels.

310
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,239
There is no confession.

311
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,238
There are
no backroom deals.

312
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,480
I got myself into this,
I'm gonna get myself out of it.

313
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,035
You know that. I do, and that's what
I told him.

314
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,918
Well, there you have it.

315
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,320
Good luck in
the courts, man.

316
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
What about
your daughter?

317
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,195
You know, if you're not gonna
do it for your country,

318
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,360
at least do it
for your kid.

319
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,072
Big mistake, kid.

320
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,198
Hold on. Luke, Luke.

321
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,998
He's still working
from the manual.

322
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,071
I mean, he doesn't even
really know the rules.

323
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,279
Now, come on,
give him a break.

324
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,551
Give me a break.

325
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Luke.

326
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
Appreciate it.

327
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,479
It's good to
see you, Nobody.

328
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,795
You, too.

329
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,919
Rule number one...

330
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,474
Know your audience.

331
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,835
I gave you your shot.
You shit the bed.

332
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,956
Now I'm gonna show you
how to get this done.

333
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,637
You're dead, cop. Dead!

334
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,189
I'm gonna slice
some bacon off your back, pig.

335
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,471
Well, well, well...

336
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,349
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that.

337
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,157
The bent cop got his day.

338
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,976
You know, that color
looks good on you.

339
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,536
Yeah, it'll look a whole hell of a
lot better with your blood on it.

340
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,198
Yeah, good luck
with that, Hercules.

341
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,513
Lawman gone bad, huh?

342
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,794
Such a cliché.

343
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,478
Oh, well,
welcome to the club.

344
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,952
I wouldn't get
that twisted, son.

345
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,151
We ain't in no club,
we got nothing in common.

346
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,920
And unlike you,
I ain't gonna be here long.

347
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,480
What, you bring
a shovel, did you?

348
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,308
Because it's 38 feet
of steel and concrete.

349
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,114
Or so I've been told.

350
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,719
Better get to digging.

351
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Wanker.

352
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,189
Yeah.

353
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,714
Move.

354
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,913
Say that again.

355
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,314
If I say it again,
it'll be to a corpse.

356
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,953
I'm gonna enjoy this.

357
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,555
Welcome back, Dom.

358
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,035
Nice job out there.

359
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,239
You excited
about tonight?

360
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
You're going
on this?

361
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,399
You're with me, Dom.

362
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,759
Showing me
your shoe collection?

363
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Yep.

364
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,277
A pair for
every occasion.

365
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,318
You have enough guns in here
to outfit a small army, huh?

366
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,596
Oh, this is just
the tip of the iceberg.

367
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,872
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.

368
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,594
I mean, you're a man
who lives by his own rules.

369
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,520
Which is surprising,
because when I saw you in Cuba,

370
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,871
I heard about a guy who almost
killed you with a motorcycle,

371
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,634
and you let him
keep his car?

372
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,798
Oh, that confused you?

373
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Hmm.

374
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,837
'Course I could've
taken his car.

375
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,112
But it's about
something bigger.

376
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,273
This way...

377
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
I changed him.

378
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,799
That's not
your responsibility.

379
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,752
But it's who I am.
Is it?

380
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,960
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?

381
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,232
Family.
No, it's not.

382
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,833
Not if you're being honest.

383
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,359
It's the 10 seconds
between start and finish,

384
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,271
when you're not thinking
about anything.

385
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,319
No family,
no obligations.

386
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,708
Just you.

387
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,835
Being free.

388
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,195
I gotta tell you,

389
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,478
this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood
nonsense you've been doing recently?

390
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,229
It's bullshit.
It's not you.

391
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,398
Be who you are.

392
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,031
Why live only
a quarter mile at a time

393
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,714
when you can live
your whole life that way?

394
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,229
Is that it?

395
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,308
Is that all those bloated-out
muscles will give ya?

396
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,353
All show and no go.

397
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,549
Oh, I got plenty of go.

398
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,956
You must've misplaced that

399
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,320
when I kicked your arse up and
down that office of yours.

400
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,395
Yeah.

401
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,476
Just like you Brits,
rewriting history, huh?

402
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,951
All I know is, it wasn't me that was
thrown out of a four-story window.

403
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Jumped.

404
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,038
I jumped out of a four-story window,
saving my partner's life.

405
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,230
'Cause where I'm from,
we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.

406
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,936
Well, that's funny,
because where I'm from,

407
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,030
we don't need women
to run to our rescue.

408
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,633
I mean, do you really believe
you can stand in front of me

409
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,155
and beat me in a straight-up,
old-fashioned fist fight?

410
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,554
Let me tell you something.

411
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,914
Me and you, one-on-one,
no one else around.

412
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,678
I will beat your ass
like a Cherokee drum.

413
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,073
Maybe one day
we'll find out.

414
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,431
Oh, you better hope
that day never comes.

415
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,636
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.

416
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,388
I'll get out my way.

417
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
The right way!

418
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,136
Hey! Why's the door open?
Get back in your cell!

419
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,798
Relax. It's just
a malfunction.

420
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,712
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.

421
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,797
Stop him!
Don't let him get away!

422
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,435
Hobbs!

423
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,751
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

424
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,148
Keep waiting, bitch.

425
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,635
Rubber bullets. Big mistake.

426
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,955
Well, that took longer
than I expected.

427
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,456
- Two questions.
- Yeah.

428
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,436
My daughter?
With your sister.

429
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,872
Toretto?

430
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,678
It's interesting you ask.

431
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,154
This is my new base.
Welcome to nowhere.

432
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,034
It's a little
sterile for you.

433
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,216
Listen, there's something
I wanna talk to you about after.

434
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,639
Hey, listen, guys.
Thanks...

435
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,870
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? Handcuffs? What is this?

436
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,553
It's called abuse of power.

437
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,868
You told me
to round them up.

438
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,160
I didn't tell you
to hand...

439
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,515
Cut 'em loose. Oh, man.
This is embarrassing.

440
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,473
I'm sorry, guys,
really, I...

441
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,800
So, this is how
you treat old friends?

442
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,310
Friends? We don't even really
know who the hell this guy is.

443
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,600
Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?

444
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,989
Nobody. So, then,
who is he?

445
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,880
Him? He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.

446
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,952
Clearly, we're getting
nowhere with nobody.

447
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,948
I've been in here for four
hours, and my ribs are showing.

448
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,796
I don't know about y'all,
but I'm out.

449
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,872
I wouldn't recommend that.
What?

450
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,474
Well, thanks
to your botched Berlin job,

451
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,790
you all made Interpol's
Top 10 Most Wanted list.

452
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,109
- Top 10.
- Mmm-hmm.

453
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
That's all right.

454
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,593
Well, not you, Roman.
What do you mean?

455
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,035
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...

456
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,230
I'm... I missed?
Yeah.

457
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,835
That's impossible!

458
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,840
What number did they come in at?

459
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,197
Six, eight, nine, ten.

460
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,429
She's 10?
Mmm-hmm.

461
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,590
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a 10.

462
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,518
Oh, she's definitely a 10.

463
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,433
How about we focus on someone who we're
not gonna find on anybody's list.

464
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,392
We're awaiting
hard confirmation,

465
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,359
but I believe that's the cyber
terrorist known as Cipher.

466
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,396
Wait, no. Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.

467
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,760
Not according
to our sources.

468
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,949
What does she want?

469
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,149
No one knows.

470
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,431
Cipher is like
a digital act of God.

471
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,873
They... Well, she can manipulate
world systems from the shadows.

472
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,696
Anything that can be hacked
is hers to play with.

473
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,395
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.

474
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,711
Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds, worldwide.

475
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,153
So, basically,
she's the bogeyman.

476
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,392
Damn, she's one of the hottest
bogeymans I've ever seen.

477
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,359
I mean, if y'all know her,
tell her to get at your boy.

478
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,520
- What are you, 12?
- That was my shin, mother...

479
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,189
Let's just say, people are scared of
the hacker group Anonymous.

480
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,880
But even Anonymous
won't mess with her.

481
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,275
What the hell does any of
this have to do with us?

482
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,475
Probably nothing, Letty,

483
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,993
but I do find it
interesting that,

484
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,798
apparently,
for some reason,

485
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,871
she's now working
with this guy.

486
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,989
He's already delivered a fully
operational EMP into her hands.

487
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,239
Detonate that, they can turn any
city in the world into a war zone.

488
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,108
So, then, what is it
you're suggesting we do?

489
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,496
Maybe we find Dom, huh?

490
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,669
Well, first,
let's catch him,

491
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,637
and then figure out
why he's turned.

492
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,799
So, y'all want us
to track Dom.

493
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,155
Yeah, I know, Roman,
it's kind of a big job.

494
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,709
It's impossible.

495
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,158
Which is why I'm bringing
in an extra pair of hands.

496
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,794
Ah, my day just got
a whole hell of a lot better.

497
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,240
Mr. Nobody,
you wanna tell me why

498
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,757
you just put me in a room with this
tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?

499
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,115
What a big mouth
on a small head,

500
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,236
coming from Prisoner 6753.

501
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,456
Don't think we've forgotten
everything that you've done.

502
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,914
We are not teaming up
with this guy.

503
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,560
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.

504
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,271
I don't care about you, your crew,
or your little family.

505
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,749
I'm here for Cipher.

506
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,896
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head Asshole?

507
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,936
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's
cutting off the circulation to your brain.

508
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,188
You should get
a bigger size.

509
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,435
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.

510
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,056
When I said no,
she went after my brother.

511
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,311
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?

512
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,428
Former hell-raiser
and current guest

513
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,114
at a nasty
little black site prison.

514
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,431
Cipher corrupted him
and left him for dead.

515
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,816
So, if I get a shot
to take her down,

516
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,114
believe me, Flex,
I'm taking it.

517
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,176
You're taking my boot right up your ass,
is what you're taking.

518
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,953
Guys, guys. The fastest way to
find Cipher is through Toretto.

519
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,429
Now, aside from myself,
there's only two men in the world

520
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,976
that have ever managed to actually
track him down with any success.

521
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,798
And guess what. They're both
standing in front of me right now.

522
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,872
So, like it or not,
you two are gonna work together.

523
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,029
You got that?

524
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,188
I'm gonna take
that as a yes.

525
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,953
Am I the only one
seeing this?

526
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,159
Oh, this ought
to be good.

527
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,475
Use God's Eye.

528
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,519
We put our lives
on the line,

529
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,433
running around the world trying
to figure this thing out.

530
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,873
It can find anybody, right?

531
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,033
Let's use it
to find Dom.

532
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,352
Roman, that is
a great idea.

533
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,709
Did you hear that?
"Great idea."

534
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,559
No, no, no, don't tune it out.
Huh?

535
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,837
Mr. Nobody,
let's fire it up, huh?

536
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,918
Got him.
He's in London.

537
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,120
Yeah.

538
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,270
Wait. We've got
a second match in Hong Kong.

539
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,908
Beijing and Seoul.

540
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,513
And Tokyo.

541
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,958
And just about every
other major city on the planet.

542
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,510
And so, God's Eye
was where we started.

543
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,471
But Cipher's already
created an evasion

544
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,633
that masks their location by pinging
random spots all over the globe,

545
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,318
but it was
a good thought, Roman.

546
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,312
So, she's made
my program obsolete.

547
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,789
And that, Ramsey,
is why you're here.

548
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,748
See, simple solutions aren't
gonna cut it here, slick.

549
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,559
Why you look at me
when you say that?

550
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,679
Wait a second. Wait,
wait. Simple solutions might just cut it.

551
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,396
You see, in order for God's Eye to
give off all these false pings,

552
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,391
means they have to be
using a FLEA relay.

553
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,640
Watch these two.

554
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,790
Which means it has a
decaying sync randomizer.

555
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,074
Which we can reverse...

556
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,233
And track it back to the originating
source and find Dom's true location.

557
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,680
I'm telling you,
they got skills.

558
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,309
That was my idea.

559
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,576
That's what I was saying.
Remember in there?

560
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,192
All right,
let's try this.

561
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,835
It's working.

562
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,471
Time you wanna check your manual and
start organizing a force response.

563
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,856
Let's get a hold of
our international assets...

564
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,313
He's still green.

565
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,231
Yeah, like
fresh baby shit.

566
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,880
As soon as we have Toretto's location,
I want to mobilize.

567
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,119
Let's get a hold of
a better asshole.

568
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,390
- No one respects you...
- Cover.

569
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,560
Get away from me.

570
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,600
All right,
they're not in China.

571
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,040
Or Russia.

572
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,555
Europe's clear.

573
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,918
But this one's
not going away.

574
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,595
This is interesting.

575
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Why?

576
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,194
Because that's here.

577
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,376
Did you all enjoy that?

578
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,755
Next-generation
concussion grenade.

579
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,074
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it'll wear off in an hour.

580
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,752
Probably.

581
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,635
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.

582
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,353
Look at this,
body's not even cold, Dom.

583
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,915
Your family's
already replacing you.

584
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,756
You chose the losing team.

585
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,474
I guess your brother
is smarter than you.

586
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,034
Smart move, embedding God's
Eye into the mainframe.

587
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,756
Irritating to make me have to come all
the way down here to get it, but...

588
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,515
Let's go.

589
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,389
Dom!

590
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,910
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?

591
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,919
Let's go.

592
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,389
You okay?

593
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,915
That wasn't him.

594
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,830
I don't know what
she's got on him,

595
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,359
but that wasn't Dom.

596
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,519
Brian would know
what to do.

597
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,669
No!

598
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,034
We can't bring
Brian and Mia into this.

599
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,999
We agreed on that.

600
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,509
I know.

601
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,437
Back there,
was that for her,

602
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,279
for me, or you?

603
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,669
And was it
even necessary?

604
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,511
Necessary?

605
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,079
Nothing is necessary.

606
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,435
Everything is a choice.

607
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,909
And I simply made one.
But so did you.

608
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,315
You could've stopped me,
but you chose not to.

609
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,630
I wonder what Letty
thought about that.

610
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,475
The problem with putting
your foot on a tiger's neck

611
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,153
is you can never let it up.

612
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,912
I think I need to remind you
why you chose to be here.

613
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,955
Elena.

614
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,429
Dom?

615
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,873
I'm sorry.

616
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,595
You shouldn't have come.

617
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,870
Nothing could have
kept me away.

618
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,519
Now she has
the three of us.

619
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,952
Do you wanna see him?

620
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,474
See Papa?

621
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,473
See Papa.

622
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,674
Papa.

623
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,790
When I realized
I was pregnant,

624
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,836
you had just found out
Letty was alive.

625
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,877
So I decided when Letty and you
got back from your honeymoon,

626
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,917
I was going to tell you.

627
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,277
But then she took us
before I had the chance.

628
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,589
His name?

629
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,157
I call him Marcos.

630
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,671
But that's
his middle name.

631
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,389
I thought his father should
give him his first name.

632
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,396
I'm sorry, Dom.

633
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,715
There's nothing
to be sorry for.

634
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,748
Whatever happens,

635
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,551
just save our son.

636
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,152
Your son.

637
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,712
Good visit?

638
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,639
I know. I know
what you're thinking.

639
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,633
I just let the guards go,

640
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,109
so there's only two
opponents in the room.

641
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,478
Rhodes has the gun,
so you'll take him out first.

642
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,755
I know you.

643
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,277
And then you're thinking,
Elena's a cop.

644
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,637
Maybe the two of you can
fight your way out of here.

645
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,995
So much
to think about.

646
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,511
Let me make it
easier for you.

647
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,077
Do with it as you wish.

648
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,315
Have you heard of
Choice Theory, Dom?

649
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,159
There is
a bunch of axioms,

650
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,993
but only two you really need
to concern yourself with.

651
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,836
One, the only person's behavior
we can control is our own.

652
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,278
And, two, the only thing we can truly
give another person is information.

653
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,351
So, let me give you some.

654
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,873
You see these cameras
in here?

655
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,432
The moment you make a move,
highly-paid men with weapons

656
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,955
will make their way
into this room

657
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,554
with one very
specific instruction.

658
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,918
It's not to save me.

659
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,391
It's to kill your son.

660
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,756
Now, that's a lot
of bullets,

661
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,593
and it only takes one
for you to lose everything.

662
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,354
So, I have to ask you,

663
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,836
because I know family
is so important to you.

664
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,478
Is that really a choice
you want to make?

665
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,036
Because I'm ready
if you are.

666
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,877
If I pull this trigger,
and God knows I want to,

667
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,552
if I killed everyone
on this plane,

668
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,631
I still couldn't
get in there.

669
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,473
'Cause of your two-man
fail-safe system.

670
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,192
Since I'm alone,

671
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,030
I got no choice!

672
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,950
I didn't think so.

673
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,069
You want to see the old Dom?

674
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,634
Watch.

675
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,194
Bitch.

676
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,671
Don't, don't.
Sweet dreams.

677
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,034
Please!

678
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,835
Damn it.

679
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,670
She wiped it all.
Took God's Eye.

680
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,193
That was the one thing
we could use to find them.

681
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,679
We lost everything.

682
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,040
What do you got,
Princess?

683
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,958
Finding Toretto.

684
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,197
But I got a couple
of minutes to spare,

685
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,033
if you want me to send you
to the hospital. Again.

686
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,271
Yo, Rules.

687
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,072
First off,
that's not my name.

688
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,231
Little Nobody.
Don't call me that.

689
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,496
Oh, that's
definitely sticking.

690
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,520
Great. Do me a favor

691
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,696
and tell Your Majesty over there
that we're gonna find Toretto.

692
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,472
We find Toretto
together as a team.

693
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,760
And when this
is all over with,

694
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,309
I'm happy to slap that whisker
biscuit right off his face.

695
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,856
Wait a minute, guys,
I think Deckard's actually onto something.

696
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,154
How do you think
Dom and Cipher

697
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,470
got into the country
without us knowing?

698
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,395
Ghost flights.

699
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,393
I thought untraceable aircraft was
all Internet conspiracy stuff.

700
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,515
It's not.

701
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,394
Satellites and radar grids
all across the globe

702
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,630
shift like an ocean.

703
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,916
They've got channels
that open and close.

704
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,776
And theoretically,
if you know the right people

705
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,074
who know
the right patterns...

706
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,960
You can fly right through the blind
spots completely undetected.

707
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,438
So you know
where Dom is headed?

708
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,394
Yeah. New York.

709
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,869
You see there, Luke?

710
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,076
You guys are gonna
get along just great.

711
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,074
Which proves rule number two,
you never lose everything.

712
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,434
Fire up the chopper.

713
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,068
Well, guys, have a ball
in the Big Apple.

714
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,156
And why are we
traveling like this again?

715
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,078
Because Dom
took God's Eye,

716
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,912
so we need to stay
off the grid.

717
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,799
But like this?

718
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,069
Look here, man.

719
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,479
Before I throw up
in my mouth,

720
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,756
let me ask you,
what are we doing here?

721
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,478
That's a good question, Roman.

722
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,028
Let me show you.

723
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,154
Welcome to our new
base of operations.

724
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,437
No, seriously.
What is this place?

725
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,029
This is heaven.

726
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,197
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.

727
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,336
This is where
we house every vehicle

728
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,510
seized from drug dealers
on the East Coast.

729
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,352
Now, Mr. Nobody said

730
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,750
that if we're gonna have a
chance at catching Dom,

731
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,350
we're gonna have
to be damn fast.

732
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,192
Figured this would help.

733
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,799
We got a tank.

734
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,076
750 horsepower,

735
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,074
6.6 liter,
V8 Duramax engine

736
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,199
with an M153 CROWS remotely
operated weapon station on top.

737
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,715
You didn't get this
from drug dealers.

738
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,475
No. No, that, uh,
the United States Army lent me.

739
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,256
See, the Army's developing
machines like this

740
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,032
that soldiers can drive
from a mile away,

741
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,708
so they can stay
safe and alive.

742
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,553
But, luckily, there's
a backup driver's seat

743
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,235
for those of us that like
to get more "hands on."

744
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,296
I'm sitting here
wondering this whole time,

745
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,232
will this thing fit in valet
at Cheesecake Factory?

746
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,755
No one is getting
"hands on."

747
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,235
She doesn't go
on city streets.

748
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,671
Wow. I'm in love.

749
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,796
Again, no, no.

750
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,837
That's a million-dollar
show car.

751
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,638
The point is to not
draw attention.

752
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,791
It's reverse psychology.

753
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,233
Dom would never
see it coming.

754
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,668
It's neon orange.

755
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,912
The International Space
Station would see it coming.

756
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,514
Go choose anything
less conspicuous.

757
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,352
No, no, no.
Calipers are my...

758
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,736
This is ridiculous.
Not happening.

759
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,416
Hey, my man, you can put
that down right there.

760
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:46,115
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.

761
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,270
I like your beard.

762
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,192
You're Blanta.
Black Santa?

763
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,588
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right there.

764
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,869
What are you doing?

765
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,389
Engine's misfiring.
I gotta check it out.

766
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,198
No, that's not part of
the plan, Dom.

767
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,634
Clearly.

768
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,360
But unless you want the
engine to seize on the job...

769
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,879
You have five minutes.

770
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,592
Five minutes.

771
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,309
I want another visual.

772
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,908
I got an ATM.

773
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,114
I don't like this.

774
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,399
I want to see Toretto.

775
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,440
There are no more cameras.
Then find something!

776
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,879
Punch in on
something reflective.

777
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,951
A car mirror, anything.

778
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,553
Do you know who I am?

779
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,073
It's why I'm here.

780
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,950
Do you know what
I'm capable of?

781
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,431
It's why I'm here.

782
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,789
I'll give you until
I finish me cuppa.

783
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,752
And I'm fucking thirsty.

784
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,473
I've got limited time,

785
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,551
so I won't take up
too much of yours.

786
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,548
Oh, no.

787
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,151
No, you've already taken everything
I have of value, Mr. Toretto.

788
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,754
What more could
you possibly want?

789
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,238
To give you
something back.

790
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,915
Talk to me.

791
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,078
Something's not right here.

792
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,751
First time I saw my son was
behind a bulletproof glass.

793
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,515
When he reached for me,
I couldn't hold him.

794
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,871
It's the worst pain
I ever felt.

795
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,039
I know you know exactly
how that feels.

796
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,116
Maybe we could change that.

797
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,553
Now, why do I think

798
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,271
you're about to suggest something
really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?

799
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,316
It's why I'm here.

800
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,155
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this. Something's not right.

801
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,474
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.

802
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,840
Go.

803
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,712
The delivery truck's
moving.

804
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,035
I know.

805
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,353
"Captain Deckard Shaw

806
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,029
"distinguished himself
by acts of gallantry

807
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:54,357
"at the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty.

808
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,077
"His bold actions saved the lives
of hostages and his teammates.

809
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:02,312
"Recommendation:
Victoria Cross."

810
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,433
Highest honor the British
government has ever given

811
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,353
to a traitor.

812
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,816
Something about this whole thing
that just doesn't add up to me.

813
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,831
Well, that would be
the same kind of funny math

814
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,278
that says a DSS agent who has a
Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.

815
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,436
Sound familiar, huh?

816
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,640
You want
to give me a hand?

817
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,960
On three?
Yeah.

818
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,559
One, two, three.

819
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,680
You know what,
Twinkle Toes?

820
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,440
In another life, I bet me and you
could've done some serious damage.

821
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,919
Yeah, we could've.
Yeah.

822
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,496
Shame I'm gonna have to bounce
your head off the fender

823
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,794
when this is all over.

824
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,115
Ah, well, with
all due respect, Captain,

825
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,600
when this whole thing is over,
we're gonna find a location,

826
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,536
and I'm gonna knock your teeth
so far down your throat,

827
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,711
you're gonna stick a toothbrush
right up your ass to brush them.

828
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,994
Give me God's Eye.

829
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:12,875
God's Eye, active.

830
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,195
Good.

831
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,758
Let's find us a Russian.

832
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,715
I spy with my little eye,

833
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,355
a Minister of Defense.

834
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,552
Upload those coordinates
to Dom's nav.

835
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,755
Copy that.

836
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,473
He's in the third car.

837
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,556
It's a Guard Class limousine.

838
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,235
Where's my team?

839
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,277
Where's his team?
There's no sign of them yet.

840
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,998
They're off the grid.

841
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,031
They're probably just
bunkered down somewhere.

842
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,280
We're closing in on 'em.

843
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,275
You guys ready?

844
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,032
One thing
I can guarantee, Dom,

845
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,398
no one's ready for this.

846
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,872
I want every chip with a zero-day
exploit in a two-mile radius

847
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,359
around that motorcade now.

848
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,873
There's over
a thousand of them.

849
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,200
Hack 'em all.

850
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,068
It's zombie time.

851
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,632
I'd buckle up if I were you.

852
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,520
Hmm?

853
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,960
What are you doing?

854
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,800
Ah!

855
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,336
Safety sensors overridden.

856
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,429
Thank you.

857
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,868
Whoa.

858
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,480
Hey!

859
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,789
Target the motorcade.

860
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,151
And here they come.

861
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,400
Ouch.

862
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,696
Police escort down.

863
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,312
Take out the lead
and follow cars.

864
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,794
Two more down.

865
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,040
They're still under warranty.

866
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,296
We got an
army of cars driving themselves!

867
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,594
Send backup, send SWAT!

868
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,796
I don't care if you send
the goddamn Boy Scouts,

869
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,148
just send 'em some help!

870
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,468
Now, that's Dom.

871
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,896
The motorcade
just turned on Seventh.

872
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,512
Perfect.
Make it rain.

873
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,869
Ah!

874
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,480
Target immobilized.

875
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,035
You're up, Dom.

876
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,856
Give me the case.

877
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,599
Good work, Dom.

878
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,675
Meet you at the pickup.

879
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,838
I think I know
where my team's at.

880
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,112
Where?
Right in front of me.

881
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,075
This is on you.

882
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,273
Get out of there, Dom.

883
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,480
Guys, I know why Dom's here.

884
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,353
Police scanners are saying
he stole a nuclear football.

885
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,080
It's over, Toretto.

886
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,799
Get your ass
outta the car now.

887
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,479
So, that's how
you wanna play this?

888
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,628
Let's play.

889
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,352
Don't do this, Dom.

890
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,749
He's going for it!

891
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,954
What are you doing?
It's a trap!

892
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,755
Damn it!

893
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,496
Now I know
what it feels like

894
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,873
to be every cop
ever chasing us!

895
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,696
I'm gonna get a little closer.
I'm gonna PIT him.

896
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,517
Oh, so,
you just gonna PIT Dom?

897
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,672
Little Nobody has
clearly lost his little mind.

898
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,275
I'm on him.

899
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,713
Easy. Work together.

900
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,560
Wait, wait, wait!

901
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,549
Oh, sh...

902
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,389
I'll take the shortcut!

903
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,711
Look out!
Watch those people!

904
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,033
Big Sexy comin' through!

905
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,994
Not this time, Dom.

906
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,151
Watch the drag
or the line will snap!

907
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,032
Stretch him out!
Hold him!

908
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,709
He's gotta have about 2,000
horsepower in that thing.

909
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,120
Try 3,000!

910
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,509
Try five.

911
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,915
Get out of there.

912
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,115
I'm working on it.

913
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,077
Stop working on it and do it.

914
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,277
No, no, no, this my Bentley!

915
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,638
No! No!

916
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,191
Get that case and run.

917
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,754
Move.

918
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,796
They thought this was
gonna be a street fight.

919
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,520
What are you
waiting for, Toretto?

920
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,549
No!

921
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,429
Letty, stop!

922
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,520
What are you gonna do?

923
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:38,593
I don't know why you're doing this,
but I know one thing.

924
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,195
You love me.

925
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,791
And you are not
gonna shoot me.

926
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,670
You should've given him the case,
'cause I won't chase you.

927
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,154
Okay.

928
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,757
I will just take it
from a dead girl.

929
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,233
You willing to die for it?

930
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,709
Let's go, then.

931
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,440
Anything?

932
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,589
They're gone.

933
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,110
And DOD confirmed it
was a nuclear football.

934
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,954
He's got an EMP and
nuclear launch codes.

935
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,915
I don't know what it is,
but they're building towards something.

936
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,389
Deckard?

937
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,240
He didn't make it.

938
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,720
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.

939
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:37,155
When push came to shove,

940
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,470
you were gonna let Letty
just walk away with the codes.

941
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,675
You got the codes!

942
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,318
Rhodes got the codes.

943
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,314
You made the choice
to let her go.

944
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,151
And now I have to
make one of my own.

945
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:04,995
They are adorable
little things, aren't they?

946
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,597
God, I hope I don't hurt him.

947
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,999
Look, psychotic, I did exactly
what you asked me to do.

948
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,275
Don't do this.

949
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,993
This is your doing.

950
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,360
My doing?

951
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,519
Da-dada.

952
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,954
Dada.

953
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,554
Da-da.

954
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,912
Please don't hurt him,
I'm begging you.

955
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,355
I don't want you to beg.

956
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,313
I want you to learn.

957
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,039
Learn what?

958
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,995
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.

959
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,795
Da-da.

960
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,516
But it was
the wrong choice.

961
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,868
This is the consequence
of that.

962
01:22:58,640 --> 01:22:59,640
No!

963
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,552
No! No!

964
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:02,948
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

965
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,912
Save your son!

966
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,395
No!

967
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,068
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the alley?

968
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,869
Traffic cams.

969
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,040
I got you.

970
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,635
I knew it.

971
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,394
I recognize that guy.

972
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,588
That's Connor Rhodes.

973
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,679
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

974
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,069
He wanted us to get
the Nightshade device for him.

975
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,674
Connor Rhodes.

976
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,909
He's also linked to somebody
I'd quite like to forget.

977
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,479
It's Mose Jakande.

978
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,156
Warlord who tried
to get God's Eye.

979
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,913
Which means that's twice that Dom
has messed up Cipher's business.

980
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,233
Everything you're
feeling right now,

981
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,233
this rage, a sense of loss,
it's not real.

982
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:30,554
It's a survival instinct
wired deep into our brains

983
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,313
to ensure continuation
of the species.

984
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,990
When early man would
visit a watering hole,

985
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,991
if they didn't
watch their child,

986
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,469
and it got snatched
by a crocodile,

987
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:49,550
our brains would create a painful
but instructional memory,

988
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,752
so it would
never happen again.

989
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,072
This idea of "family"
that is so core with you,

990
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,998
that rules your world,

991
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,592
it's a biological lie.

992
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,078
You don't
have to accept it.

993
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,555
I don't.

994
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,512
Did you really think you could
destroy two of my teams

995
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,352
without any repercussions?

996
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,358
I wouldn't have even looked your
way if you hadn't done that.

997
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,991
You didn't even know
you had a kid.

998
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,915
You can thank me for that and start
doing the job I'm asking you to do.

999
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,513
Help you start a war.

1000
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,511
Is that what
you think I want?

1001
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,474
That's so limited.

1002
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,077
I didn't take that football
to start a war

1003
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,879
any more than I took your
son to start a family.

1004
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,717
Taking your son
got me the codes.

1005
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,350
The codes will
get me the nukes

1006
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,795
and the nukes
will get me what I want

1007
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:56,396
today, tomorrow,
and every day after that.

1008
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,079
And what's that?

1009
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,468
Accountability.

1010
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,155
The second I fire off
one of those nukes,

1011
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:09,630
I put the superpowers
of this world on notice that,

1012
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,233
when they cross the line,

1013
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,228
I'm gonna be there
to hold them responsible.

1014
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,036
Because the truth is, Dom,

1015
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,113
to the world out there,

1016
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,674
I am the crocodile
at the watering hole.

1017
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,991
We've got one
last job to do.

1018
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,108
Cipher.

1019
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,959
If I were you,
I'd kiss my son.

1020
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:57,589
Because whether you value
it or not, all of this,

1021
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,756
your plane,
your security, and you,

1022
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,796
are still on this earth
because of him.

1023
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,456
The problem we've had with tracking
Cipher is there's nothing to trace.

1024
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,920
But now,
we have Rhodes' information.

1025
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,837
And we're getting
snapshots of his data

1026
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,678
before it's
scrubbed off the net.

1027
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,136
That looks like somebody's
bank account,

1028
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,434
so why don't we
just go ahead...

1029
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,669
It's a longitude.

1030
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,630
Given the fact that
Dom hit a Russian motorcade,

1031
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,120
it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.

1032
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,236
Good. Let's start here
and run the possibilities.

1033
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,673
Yalta, Poltava...

1034
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,440
It's like they just
threw letters together.

1035
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,555
Kronyurt.

1036
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,834
It's "Vladovin."

1037
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,598
What are you doing here?
What?

1038
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,616
Told you I was gonna check
in on you from time to time

1039
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,640
to see how
you were doin'.

1040
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,153
By the way, not so hot.

1041
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,394
But there's nothing
in Vladovin. It's just ice.

1042
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,629
That's funny.

1043
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,896
Could've sworn there was a
secret Russian naval base

1044
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,831
where they retrofitted
Cold War submarines.

1045
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,229
Well, technically,
it's not Russian anymore.

1046
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:57,840
The base was taken over

1047
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,296
by a terror group of military
separatists about a month ago,

1048
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,000
and the Russians
haven't taken it back yet,

1049
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,270
so there is a little
window of opportunity here.

1050
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,875
Russian submarines.
Nuclear football.

1051
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,237
It sounds like everything we do,
our legs gonna be blown off.

1052
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,676
It sounds like you still number
11 on the list.

1053
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,758
It sounds like
you've changed

1054
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,229
since your little punk-ass
facial hairs done came in.

1055
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,475
Guys, guys.

1056
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,869
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.

1057
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,758
That's good thinking, champ,
except unfortunately,

1058
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,876
the Russian
Minister of Defense

1059
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,713
got himself involved in a little
incident on US territory,

1060
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,976
and the two governments aren't
talking to each other for a while.

1061
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,638
By the time they do,
it'll be too late.

1062
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,517
So, any other
suggestions?

1063
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,396
Yeah. I got one.

1064
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,111
How about we just
stop them ourselves?

1065
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,077
You're talking about
a Russian military base.

1066
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,309
Separatist.

1067
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,469
Whatever.
It's suicide.

1068
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,039
It's stopping World War III.

1069
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,229
What's it gonna be, rook?

1070
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,830
You gonna close your
eyes on this one, too?

1071
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,440
Pray that
the apocalypse doesn't come

1072
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,953
knocking on your
mama's front door?

1073
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,989
Or, are you gonna
saddle up, be a man,

1074
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,594
and save the entire
goddamn world?

1075
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,034
You know,
I think I figured it out.

1076
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,475
What's that?

1077
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,517
Rule number three.
Which is?

1078
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,115
There are no rules.

1079
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,597
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.

1080
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,376
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.

1081
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,960
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.

1082
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,878
All bets are off?
Bets are off?

1083
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,279
Do svidanya!

1084
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,920
Letty, I don't like
telling you this one bit.

1085
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,753
But the game's changed.

1086
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:02,153
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom,
but now, after all this,

1087
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,152
I want you to know,
if I have to,

1088
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,755
I'm gonna put him down.

1089
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,440
Then you might have
to take us both down.

1090
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,434
I'm freezing, man.

1091
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,400
This ain't for me.

1092
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:19,194
I come from a different
kind of lifestyle, brah.

1093
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,830
Ladies know me. They know
where I'm at with it.

1094
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,999
I tried to take a piss,
I didn't even recognize myself.

1095
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,670
Man, that's entirely
too much information.

1096
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:33,909
I'm just sayin'.

1097
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,752
Well, one thing's
for sure.

1098
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:39,148
Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a trade,

1099
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,673
because no one
would be this insane

1100
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,352
to hit this place
without a damn army.

1101
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,670
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

1102
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:48,354
Speak of the devil.

1103
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,716
All right, Dom, you're one step
closer to that family reunion.

1104
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,029
400 meters to base.

1105
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,555
Prep the EMP. Let's take
these defenses down.

1106
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,920
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.

1107
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,558
EMP is recharging.
How long?

1108
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,108
Sixty seconds.

1109
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,520
All right, Dom, you have one
pulse left in that EMP.

1110
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,632
That sub is heavily insulated.

1111
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,440
You're gonna need to be right
underneath it for this thing to work.

1112
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,709
Come on.

1113
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,320
Yes!

1114
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:56,993
Two birds with one stone.

1115
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,536
We've got control of the sub.

1116
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,233
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.

1117
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:04,392
Okay, Matty,
let's take this baby for a spin.

1118
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,229
Damn!

1119
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,000
I think Cipher just rebooted that
sub to slave its command system.

1120
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,719
What the hell
is he talking about?

1121
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,509
In layman's terms,
she just carjacked a submarine.

1122
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,632
We can't let it get away.

1123
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:24,719
There's the control room.

1124
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:27,231
If you can get me
into that wheelhouse,

1125
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,276
I can tap the network
and counter-hack Cipher.

1126
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,998
Keep it from
lowering into the water.

1127
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,957
No, what we need to do
is get me on that sub.

1128
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,256
I find the weapons room
and I can pull the launch chip

1129
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,800
before she can fire
any of those nukes.

1130
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:37,949
That is too crazy.

1131
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,456
What you're saying
is too dangerous.

1132
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,515
We'll do both.

1133
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:05,920
Knock, knock.

1134
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,315
Five vehicles
just breached the base.

1135
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,152
They just don't give up,
do they?

1136
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,794
All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time!

1137
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,833
Letty, let's roll!

1138
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,633
Go! Go, go, go!

1139
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,040
Change of plans, Dom.

1140
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,400
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.

1141
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,193
I'm done. I want my son.

1142
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,480
I'll tell you
when you're done.

1143
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,159
Your team is in play.

1144
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,635
Now, meet Rhodes and
follow my instruction.

1145
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,672
I've got you covered! Go!

1146
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,154
Move, move!
Get outta here! Go, go, go!

1147
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,150
Okay.
How do you like this?

1148
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,656
Remote link has been severed.

1149
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,033
I'll take care of this.

1150
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,279
Hi, Ramsey.

1151
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,434
She's regained control.

1152
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,828
Damn it. She's good.

1153
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:49,536
They're entering
the weapons room.

1154
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,595
Oh, that's cute.

1155
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,680
Pull! Pull!

1156
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:01,075
Roman, Roman!
We gotta find the chip, go!

1157
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:05,828
Oh, she's slick.

1158
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,720
Gonna have to do
better than that, though.

1159
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,551
Okay, now you're
starting to piss me off.

1160
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,870
Ramsey, how much time
we talkin' here?

1161
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,397
You're smart,
but not smart enough.

1162
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:36,880
She's locked me out.

1163
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,354
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.

1164
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,556
I can't! This thing's
gone into attack mode!

1165
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,756
The door's not gonna open
until you pull the chip!

1166
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,593
Tej, we got no idea what the
hell we're looking for.

1167
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I got it!

1168
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,394
What in the hell
are you guys doin'?

1169
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,470
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me, okay?

1170
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,118
It'll be labeled
"Guidance Go."

1171
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,216
Guidance Go, Guidance Go...
Okay, I got somethin'.

1172
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,639
What?
It says...

1173
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:14,875
Do you understand that?

1174
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,353
Wow. Nasty.

1175
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:53,755
Hmm.

1176
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,353
Quite a show.

1177
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:00,440
We're arming the nuke.

1178
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,056
Nuke's going hot!

1179
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,320
She's tryin'
to fire this thing!

1180
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,456
Roger that.
We're moving out.

1181
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,536
Disable the nukes!

1182
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,296
Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.

1183
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,958
I don't see shit.
I'm holding on!

1184
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,068
And we have a countdown.

1185
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,392
What the hell
is goin' on, man?

1186
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,552
We're about to launch a nuclear missile,
is what the hell is goin' on!

1187
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:26,675
Pull the damn chip!

1188
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,469
Countdown, countdown!
Look for a countdown!

1189
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,595
What countdown?

1190
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:35,318
The missiles need to
activate to launch.

1191
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,038
The countdown timer
won't be in Russian.

1192
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,360
The countdown...

1193
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,030
Let's show the world
what we've got.

1194
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:44,040
No, no, no!
Don't press that!

1195
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,400
I got it.

1196
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,391
Something's wrong.
It won't launch.

1197
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:55,588
Get that sub outta there.
Now!

1198
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,758
Move your ass, Roman!

1199
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:08,789
You all right?

1200
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,600
There's nothing all right
about any of this!

1201
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,791
Let's go!
What about the missiles?

1202
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,031
We got the chip.
No nukes for her.

1203
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:18,270
Hell, yeah.
Let's roll.

1204
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,914
Guys, we got company.
A lot of company!

1205
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,120
All right, team,
here's the plan.

1206
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,960
There's a sea lock
at the opening of the bay.

1207
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,336
We get there first
and close it,

1208
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:37,272
we can stop the submarine
from escaping into open water

1209
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,833
and disappearing forever.

1210
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:43,439
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles southwest.

1211
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:46,154
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!

1212
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:53,560
Ah!

1213
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:56,114
No, no, no!
This is not good!

1214
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,394
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?

1215
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:01,079
Whoa!

1216
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:02,878
You lovin' that Lambo now?

1217
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,111
Whoa! Ah!

1218
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,319
All right, everyone.

1219
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,696
We'll deal with
that launch chip later.

1220
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:18,439
Right now, I want that sub in deep
water where no one can find it.

1221
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,160
Find me the fastest
route out of that bay.

1222
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,240
Copy that.

1223
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,319
Why are they shootin' at me?

1224
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:34,696
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange
Lamborghini, I don't know.

1225
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,517
Shut up, Tej!

1226
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,193
Dom...

1227
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,520
Do you really
wanna put that car in gear?

1228
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,600
Do it.

1229
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:48,960
Huh?

1230
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:53,113
I didn't think so.

1231
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:54,480
They're heading
for the sea lock.

1232
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,896
They're trying to
trap the sub in the bay.

1233
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,832
I should have taken care
of this a long time ago.

1234
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,354
Rhodes, take his team out.

1235
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,394
I'm on it.

1236
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,348
Roman, get in front of me!

1237
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,918
Okay, y'all wanna play rough?

1238
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,800
Now it's my turn.

1239
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:36,993
Yeah, baby!

1240
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,355
Guys, we got snowmobiles
on the right.

1241
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,913
They're gonna flank us!

1242
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,080
No, they ain't!

1243
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,308
Oh, shit!

1244
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:19,680
Tej!

1245
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,552
Roman, hold tight,
I'm on the way!

1246
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,150
I don't wanna
go swimmin'! No!

1247
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,434
Really, Tej?

1248
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,313
Oh, no, no, no!

1249
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:45,429
Oh, shit!

1250
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:49,394
Roman, grab your door!

1251
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:50,549
Tej!

1252
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,119
Grab the door, Roman!

1253
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,200
It's so cold!
Shit!

1254
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:54,800
Oh, shit!

1255
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:02,828
Whoa!

1256
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:04,434
Whoo!
Yeah!

1257
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:06,798
What is going on?

1258
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:07,949
Roman, hang on!

1259
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:10,480
Tej!

1260
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:15,792
Get me off of this thing!

1261
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:17,513
Tej!

1262
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Come on!

1263
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,279
Argh!

1264
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,349
All right.
I've had enough of this shit!

1265
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:55,198
Number 11, my ass!

1266
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:00,553
Yo, shrinkage!
We got a sub to catch. Get in!

1267
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,400
What?

1268
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:16,896
Depressurization alert
in the cargo hold.

1269
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:18,558
Drop it to 10,000 feet.

1270
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:21,755
I know how much
these people mean to you.

1271
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,956
So I will let you pick
the first target.

1272
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:25,712
I don't pick a target
from a mile away.

1273
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:30,074
I stand face to face
and look 'em dead in the eye.

1274
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:33,593
Okay.

1275
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:34,914
The wife it is.

1276
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,998
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy having this.

1277
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,153
Hey, don't go
gettin' any ideas.

1278
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,840
You and planes
don't have a good history.

1279
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,799
No shit.

1280
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:06,599
Okay, let's go, Scarface.

1281
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,960
These assholes
ain't gonna kill themselves.

1282
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,277
Pull up surveillance
right now.

1283
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,799
Surprise.

1284
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,436
You're supposed to be dead.

1285
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:44,155
We have a security breach in the
cargo hold. Take care of it now.

1286
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:52,552
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.

1287
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,153
Oh, shut up.
Don't be such a baby.

1288
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:01,600
Get to the pilot.

1289
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,400
He's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.

1290
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,319
Give Cipher my regards.

1291
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,152
Did Toretto hold up
his end of the deal?

1292
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:22,075
He gave us
this little thing here.

1293
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:24,351
No, no, no. Don't touch.

1294
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,240
You can track Cipher with this,

1295
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:29,278
but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of ya.

1296
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,351
Fine. I've got contacts.

1297
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,959
No, you're gonna
take your brother.

1298
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,234
Oh, dear...
Yes.

1299
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,396
Toretto knows where he is.

1300
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:43,136
He's got this thing.
It can see everything.

1301
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,549
It's like... It's called the
Devil's Bum Hole or something.

1302
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:46,709
It's called the God's Eye.

1303
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:47,869
Yeah, well, whatever.

1304
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,960
There's no way
I'm using Owen, all right?

1305
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,758
He's a lost cause.

1306
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:57,877
He's your brother, Decks.
He's my son.

1307
01:47:58,400 --> 01:47:59,833
He's our family.

1308
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,951
And our family don't die
in bloody cages.

1309
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:07,477
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.

1310
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:10,632
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.

1311
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:12,040
Call yourself a brother?
You're...

1312
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,355
Look, come here...
Mum. Okay, okay.

1313
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,391
Every time.

1314
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:23,280
Owen.

1315
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,874
In position.

1316
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:27,400
Go.

1317
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,149
I'm in.

1318
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:50,240
I've got the package, Toretto.

1319
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,598
All 12 pounds of him.

1320
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,353
Ah.

1321
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:57,796
Dada. Dada.

1322
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,391
You made me miss my shot.

1323
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,311
What you think you're doing?

1324
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,113
Looking at you
dead in the eye.

1325
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,311
That was for Elena.

1326
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Rhodes.

1327
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:52,832
He's no longer with us.

1328
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,432
Rhodes picked
the wrong target.

1329
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,588
Congratulations, Dom.
You just killed your son.

1330
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:03,513
You're wrong.
I just saved him.

1331
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,515
And you just took your foot
off the tiger's neck.

1332
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,873
All right, governor,
it's gonna get noisy.

1333
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,632
This is for your ears.

1334
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:26,635
Good?

1335
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:30,669
Let's go.

1336
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:36,191
No! Stop him!
Do not let him get off this plane!

1337
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,598
We got another problem.

1338
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:42,616
That truck's got enough
missiles to take us all out.

1339
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,800
Then don't give 'em a target.

1340
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,216
Everybody, get in front of us, line up,
and we'll take the hit.

1341
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:49,152
What? I need to
switch cars right now!

1342
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,590
Roman, here comes the bad part.
What?

1343
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:16,635
Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.

1344
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:19,598
It's easy for you to say
when your ass ain't on fire.

1345
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:26,195
All right, little man,

1346
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,756
this might be a little scary,

1347
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:30,599
but it's gonna be
a lot of fun.

1348
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,080
How's the music, good?

1349
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:44,160
Ah.

1350
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:57,948
They're locking on.

1351
01:51:58,040 --> 01:51:59,519
Sorry, guys,
I got no tricks left.

1352
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,600
What do we do now?

1353
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:02,073
We start prayin'!

1354
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,640
Hell, yeah!

1355
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,674
There's Dom!

1356
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:45,039
What, is this guy
on our side now?

1357
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:46,997
Who the hell cares?
He just saved our ass!

1358
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:52,557
Good to be riding
with you again, man.

1359
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,440
Toretto just
cleared the way for them.

1360
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:08,999
Someone, give me something!

1361
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,115
Torpedoes are ready.

1362
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,235
Then launch them!

1363
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:25,760
Shit.

1364
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:31,317
Take the wheel!
I ain't takin' shit!

1365
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,799
Take the wheel!

1366
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:34,320
Where you goin'?

1367
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:37,314
This is crazy!

1368
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:38,594
Speed up!

1369
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,318
Left and back!
What?

1370
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:45,630
Turn the goddamn wheel
to the left really quickly!

1371
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,834
Boom, baby!

1372
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:01,749
Goin' for a ride.

1373
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,240
Back in a sec.

1374
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:24,959
Where's that smile?
Ah.

1375
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,189
There it is.

1376
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,149
You were gonna shoot a baby?

1377
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,556
You sick bastard.

1378
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:38,760
You're not gonna
wanna see this.

1379
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:53,115
Is that you or him?

1380
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:57,877
Him. Good.

1381
01:54:58,240 --> 01:54:59,514
The torpedoes missed.

1382
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,416
They're gonna reach the lock
before the sub does.

1383
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,634
The hell they are.

1384
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:06,719
Get ready for this.

1385
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Oh, shit!

1386
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,433
We're gonna need
a bigger truck.

1387
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:42,552
It's right under us!
Get out the way!

1388
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:55,909
Get us out of here!

1389
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:57,593
Why are you always yelling?

1390
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:02,874
This bitch is crazy!

1391
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:04,313
Look out!

1392
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:11,549
That's not good.

1393
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,558
That's not good.

1394
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,231
Please tell me there's
nothing to worry about!

1395
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:21,719
We got this.

1396
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:35,588
That's my girl.

1397
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:44,833
The sub's too close. We ain't
making it to the gate in time.

1398
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:46,320
We're just going
to let it get away?

1399
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:47,919
Not if I know Dom.

1400
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,274
You lose, Dom.

1401
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,709
I destroyed two of your teams.

1402
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,269
I killed your
red-headed boyfriend.

1403
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:02,477
And I put two killers
on your untraceable plane.

1404
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:06,393
You lost the minute
you interrupted my honeymoon.

1405
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,111
Now guess who I'm coming for.

1406
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:11,671
Put a heatseeker on him now.

1407
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:14,829
Now!

1408
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,160
Fire!

1409
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:27,755
That's a goddamn
heatseeker coming at us!

1410
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:32,875
Peel off!
Head to the shore!

1411
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,793
All right.
Come and get it.

1412
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:00,875
No, no, no.

1413
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:04,876
Dive! Dive!

1414
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:06,708
This...

1415
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,552
This is for my son.

1416
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:28,840
Dom!

1417
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:32,879
You're out of bullets,
Deckard.

1418
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:35,599
Not like I'm gonna need a gun
to take care of you.

1419
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,473
How did you find me?

1420
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:41,913
You want to see
the old Dom?

1421
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:44,514
Watch.

1422
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:49,033
Resourceful.

1423
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:51,750
You have a lot to
answer for, Cipher.

1424
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:54,191
What you've put
my family through.

1425
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:56,079
My mother.

1426
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,795
I'm gonna make sure
that never happens again.

1427
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:01,589
To anyone.

1428
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:04,669
There is only one flaw
in your plan.

1429
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:05,835
What's that?

1430
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,195
Only one of us
has a parachute.

1431
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:32,313
Told you this would be fun.

1432
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:37,479
Time to land, boys.

1433
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:49,638
You know I never
left you, Letty.

1434
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:50,988
I know.

1435
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:53,675
And you know
I never will.

1436
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:56,559
I know.

1437
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,397
I have so much
to tell you.

1438
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:13,033
Yeah, you do. And you can
start with that bitch.

1439
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,676
Now, that's
Dominic Toretto.

1440
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:23,760
Hey, Dom!

1441
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:25,677
I'm just throwin' it
out there,

1442
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:27,958
we need to get up
outta here

1443
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:31,271
'cause there's all kinda nuclearism
happening under this ice.

1444
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:34,716
Relax. Without the trigger chips,
those nukes are harmless.

1445
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:36,832
Okay. So we good, then.

1446
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:40,032
Let me go on and get
my young selfie levels up.

1447
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:42,551
You realize this is
classified, right?

1448
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:43,993
Not today.

1449
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:47,155
Unbelievable.

1450
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:49,754
All right, can we get up outta here, now?
I'm freezin'!

1451
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:18,789
It's okay.

1452
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:21,716
Don't worry.
He's gonna be here soon.

1453
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:23,832
I get it.
Y'all got a lot in common.

1454
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:26,878
Computer hacks, God's Eye,
geeks, nerd... You know.

1455
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,598
But we got a lot in common,
too, right?

1456
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:29,829
Like what?

1457
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:33,310
We walk in the room
and we're oozin' sex appeal.

1458
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:35,630
Me and you,
hip to hip, is a problem.

1459
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:38,154
I'm askin' a real
question right now.

1460
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:41,471
Is it gonna be
Revenge of the Nerds

1461
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:45,955
or The Dark Knight? Huh?

1462
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:48,236
To be honest,
I like both of you.

1463
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:54,312
But just before
we get into all of that,

1464
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,197
let me ask you
one question.

1465
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:58,157
You can ask me anything.

1466
02:02:58,240 --> 02:02:59,355
Anything.

1467
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,793
What's my last name?

1468
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:07,070
When you guys figure it out, then,
I guess you can let me know.

1469
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:09,833
It's gonna be Parker.
That's all that really matters.

1470
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,239
- Jones.
- Mrs. Parker.

1471
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:13,636
Right?
Hey, Mrs. Parker...

1472
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:15,195
Hey.

1473
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:16,554
Letty.

1474
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:18,153
I wanted to thank you.

1475
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:19,680
No need.

1476
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:21,920
Well...

1477
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:25,016
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens,

1478
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:27,429
but she won't be nuking
any cities anytime soon.

1479
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:28,714
Thanks to you guys.

1480
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,916
So, I got you
a party favor.

1481
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,616
This can't be good.

1482
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:35,154
Your record's been cleared.
Full reinstatement.

1483
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:36,798
You've got your job back.

1484
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:38,359
That is, if you want it.

1485
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:42,915
If I want?

1486
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Mmm-hmm.

1487
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:54,672
You know, after 16 years,
I figure it's time for a little break.

1488
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:56,469
Wow.

1489
02:03:58,040 --> 02:03:59,996
Daddy's stayin' home.

1490
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:07,555
Nobody.

1491
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:08,675
Keep in touch.

1492
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:10,718
Ah. Hang on a second.

1493
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:13,230
This could be interesting.

1494
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:19,640
What made
you think I'd do it?

1495
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:21,794
Brotherhood.

1496
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:25,509
I saw that look you gave Cipher,
knew you wanted revenge.

1497
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:27,319
Glad I did it.

1498
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:33,148
I can't believe
you went to see my mother.

1499
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:50,471
All this fuss over you.

1500
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:57,913
Yes.

1501
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,072
Elena, I promised
to keep our son safe.

1502
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:10,435
And now,
he always will be.

1503
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:22,838
I wanna introduce you to the most
important person in my universe.

1504
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,909
One who never gave up on me.

1505
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:33,669
He's beautiful.

1506
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:37,032
You've heard me say

1507
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:39,790
that you never turn
your back on family,

1508
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,799
and I wanna thank you all for
never turning your back on me.

1509
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:51,952
You wanna meet them?

1510
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:54,119
All right.

1511
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:56,279
Everyone,

1512
02:05:57,640 --> 02:05:59,039
meet Brian.

1513
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:09,548
To Brian!

1514
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:11,517
Welcome
to the family, Brian.

1515
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:14,319
Okay, I guess
it's my turn to say grace.

1516
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:17,274
We thank you
for giving us family.

1517
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:21,751
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...

1517
02:06:22,305 --> 02:07:22,529
