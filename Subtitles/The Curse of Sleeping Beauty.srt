00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:24,274
So you... left the door open again.

3
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:26,243
Cash is on the counter.

4
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:32,296
You know, as much as I love
being your personal maid...

5
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:35,619
...and running all these
little errands for you...

6
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,888
...you really need to get out
of this apartment, buddy.

7
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:40,691
This is... it's gettin' ridiculous.

8
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,127
I just have a couple
more paintings to finish up.

9
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:46,350
- But thank you for your help.
- No problem.

10
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:52,336
Hey, I'm goin' over to McGowan's.

11
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:55,072
Craig's got his birthday happening.
You should come with.

12
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:57,107
I don't like karaoke.

13
00:06:57,207 --> 00:07:00,077
It's not karaoke. It's drunk girls singing.

14
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:02,579
So it's drunk girl-araoke, which is awesome.

15
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:06,042
Everybody loves drunk girl-araoke.
You should come. Get out of your apartment.

16
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:08,435
- It smells like a shoe.
- Oh.

17
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,622
No, I'm fine.

18
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:15,776
Okay.

19
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:33,944
Sleep paralysis.

20
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:36,980
It's happening every morning now?

21
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,116
Only when I have the dream.

22
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:40,984
But it's happened two nights in a row.

23
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:43,167
It hasn't happened
that close together before.

24
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:46,944
The Sleeping Beauty dream?

25
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:50,895
It always ends the same way.
I'm about to kiss her...

26
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:55,046
...then get distracted by some
creepy-looking house and that's it.

27
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,386
Are they connected,
the sleep paralysis and the dream?

28
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:01,212
What do you think?

29
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,559
I did some reading on sleep paralysis
and it's supposedly your body...

30
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,245
...not moving smoothly
through the stages of sleep.

31
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:12,626
And... I also read that in the Dark Ages
people thought the paralysis...

32
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:16,544
...was a demon or evil spirit
sitting on your chest.

33
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,560
You mentioned that I'm your
third therapist in three years.

34
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,395
So you already know
what I'm gonna say about the dream.

35
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:28,565
Your subconscious created
this perfect, passive woman...

36
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:31,068
...with whom you are unable to connect.

37
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:34,605
Can you see the parallels here
with your isolation with people?

38
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:38,455
That is the distraction
keeping you from your real life.

39
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:41,349
Your lack of human interaction
is what makes these sessions...

40
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:43,878
...the wrong kind of necessity.

41
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:48,052
You're looking for an answer you
already know. You just won't accept.

42
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:50,324
What you need...

43
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:52,875
...is to put yourself out there again.
Be vulnerable.

44
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:57,411
Only then do I think this dream will fade
and you won't depend on this so much.

45
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:36,700
- Hello?
- <i>Is this Thomas Kaiser?</i>

46
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,902
- Yeah, this is he. Who is this?
- <i>This is Katherine...</i>

47
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:41,238
<i>...from the law office
of Jeff Jennings and Associates.</i>

48
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:44,008
<i>Can you come down to claim your inheritance?</i>

49
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:46,178
What?

50
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:49,012
Uh-huh.

51
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:50,715
Yep.

52
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,884
Yeah. Talk to you later, bye.

53
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:56,386
Where is this?

54
00:09:56,486 --> 00:10:00,037
- The address is at the top.
- It's like three hours from here.

55
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:02,242
You know what? I really know
just about as much as you do.

56
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:04,044
This firm is just the executor
of the property.

57
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:07,581
Wait. You said Clive Kaiser died
and left this property to me?

58
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:10,600
Yes. It says here
that you are the beneficiary.

59
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,070
I had to dig in the archives
downstairs for this.

60
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,572
It looks like the property's been
in your family for generations.

61
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:17,708
It doesn't make any sense.
I've never met my uncle...

62
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:20,577
Okay, you're breaking my heart.
This came in a few days ago.

63
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:22,246
It's from your uncle Clive...

64
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:26,504
...and the envelope said that it
should go to you along with the deed.

65
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:28,902
How much is the property worth?

66
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:31,321
It's never been sold,
so there's no reference.

67
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:34,758
You'll have to get it appraised.
We can help you with that, for a fee.

68
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:38,135
But you know what? You might want to go
out there and check it out on your own.

69
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:47,367
You okay?

70
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:49,373
How did he die?

71
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:53,373
Oh, it says here that his body was found
in the river by the property.

72
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:55,562
It was ruled suicide.

73
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:58,582
Thanks.

74
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:01,352
I'll have a real estate associate
meet you out there.

75
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,890
'Cause I am not drivin' out to that place.

76
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:07,044
That was stimulating.

77
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,848
<i>Thomas, I wish we had a chance
to get to know each other.</i>

78
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:37,421
<i>Your grandmother, my mother, did her best
to make sure that we had never met.</i>

79
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:40,123
<i>She was not without her reasons.</i>

80
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:44,294
<i>The men in our family
carry with us something terrible.</i>

81
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:48,765
<i>Kaiser Gardens has been
in our family for a very long time.</i>

82
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:52,869
<i>I have held watch for over four decades.</i>

83
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:56,706
<i>I cannot withstand the burden
of this property anymore.</i>

84
00:11:56,806 --> 00:12:00,210
<i>I entrust Kaiser Gardens to you.</i>

85
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:04,047
Hey, man. I brought the...
Where are you going?

86
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:06,117
I'm just gonna check something out.
I'll be back soon.

87
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:08,847
- I got you the stuff that you were asking.
- Leave it on the counter.

88
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:12,623
- What about your paintings?
- Uh, watch over 'em for me?

89
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:15,693
Watch over your paintings?

90
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,463
What, are we dating?

91
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:42,285
<i>When you reach Kaiser Gardens,
there are rules you must obey.</i>

92
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:46,723
<i>Your bloodline is able to access
all parts of the property...</i>

93
00:12:46,823 --> 00:12:51,094
<i>...but you must never enter
the hidden rooms below the basement.</i>

94
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:55,498
<i>Trust me when I say
they are sealed for a reason...</i>

95
00:12:55,598 --> 00:13:00,737
<i>...along with any objects protected
against the hands of outsiders.</i>

96
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:02,673
<i>I wish you well.</i>

97
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:05,342
<i>And I ask for your forgiveness.</i>

98
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:07,311
<i>It is a curse...</i>

99
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:10,281
<i>...and a blessing.</i>

100
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:14,568
<i>May the spirits be on your side.</i>

101
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:36,113
Hello?

102
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:23,827
Hey.

103
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:25,862
Ah, shit.

104
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:27,964
I'm so sorry. Thomas.

105
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:31,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah, hi, I'm...

106
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,904
Hi, I'm sorry. I'm Linda Coleman.
We spoke over the phone.

107
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:37,023
- I'm so sorry. I wasn't quite...
- It's okay. I kinda spooked myself out.

108
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:39,142
Yeah, I don't blame you.

109
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:49,686
Ah, this place is a shit hole.

110
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:53,524
Um, here. I'll give you
the keys to the house.

111
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:57,041
And your keys to the front door.
You just, um...

112
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:00,597
You open the door the old-fashioned way.
You just turn it.

113
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:02,532
So much for the thrill
of breaking and entering.

114
00:19:02,632 --> 00:19:05,706
And I have an appraiser
going to come by this week...

115
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:08,810
...to get a ballpark estimate
of this property.

116
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:13,943
- Sorry for your loss.
- Did you know my uncle?

117
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:16,480
No, not personally. No.

118
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,782
No, he was more of a shut-in. Were you close?

119
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:22,599
I didn't know anything about him
until a couple days ago.

120
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,756
Well, that's weird. He just...

121
00:19:26,856 --> 00:19:30,127
...he just gave you this property
just like that? That's very weird.

122
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:35,031
Based on his letter to me he was more
than just weird. He was bat shit crazy.

123
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:39,001
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:46,409
These mannequins, and his artwork
would definitely qualify him.

125
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:51,948
Um, I'm sorry.
Do you have a letter from your uncle?

126
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:54,218
You talked about that.

127
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:59,723
- The lawyer handed it to me with the deed.
- Would you mind if I take a look at it?

128
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:02,826
It's actually in my car. Why?

129
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:07,964
I'm so sorry.

130
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:10,086
You must be so tired.

131
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:14,037
It was very nice to meet you, Thomas.
Have a nice day. Bye.

132
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:49,751
Thomas.

133
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,840
I always woke up before.

134
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,213
This can't be a dream. It's too real.

135
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:06,750
This realm is like a dream.

136
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,603
One where we can both dwell.

137
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:13,957
You're in my head.

138
00:22:14,557 --> 00:22:16,413
As you are in mine.

139
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:23,033
I am also close to you in the physical world.

140
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:26,104
That is the reason I am awake.

141
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:29,473
Sleeping Beauty.

142
00:22:30,923 --> 00:22:33,217
It's what I called you before.

143
00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:36,746
Briar Rose is my given name.

144
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:38,858
I like that.

145
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:43,597
When you said you're close to me
in the physical world, what do you mean?

146
00:22:45,354 --> 00:22:47,558
So I'm still asleep...

147
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,927
...awaiting your kiss.

148
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,719
Thomas, don't go.

149
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:17,604
Rose!

150
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:05,101
Pipes are old and gonna need to be replaced.

151
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:09,138
Interior paint is decent.
Outside could use a coat.

152
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:12,529
- Sounds expensive.
- Not very well maintained.

153
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,947
Did you find anything weird inside the house?

154
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:22,972
- You're kiddin' me, right?
- I mean in terms of, like, vibes.

155
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:26,286
Are you asking me if I think
this house is haunted?

156
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:28,686
Yes.

157
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,695
Quite a few folks have gone
missing over the years...

158
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:36,633
...but the police has searched this house a
bunch of times and never found any evidence.

159
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:39,669
Fingers have always pointed
right back to this house.

160
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,938
It didn't help your uncle's popularity any.

161
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:44,834
It's probably why he didn't leave
the house that much.

162
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:47,242
Do you think it will affect the asking price?

163
00:24:47,342 --> 00:24:50,013
Yep, especially if the buyer's local.

164
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:55,051
Now I suggest you get the electrical fixed
first before we do the final estimate.

165
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:58,588
Here, I can give you this card
for the best electrician in town.

166
00:24:58,688 --> 00:25:00,957
He's the only electrician in town.

167
00:25:01,657 --> 00:25:03,993
- Thanks.
- I can come back day after tomorrow.

168
00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:06,596
We can sit down, look at the wiring,
and see what needs to be done...

169
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:09,899
- ...without breaking the bank.
- I'd appreciate that very much.

170
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:12,913
- The basement. I think there's more to it.
- What do you mean?

171
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:16,505
It's not on the blueprints and whoever
did the wall did a pretty good job, but...

172
00:25:16,605 --> 00:25:20,676
...I've been doing this job long enough to know
when there's extra square feet hidden away.

173
00:27:36,912 --> 00:27:41,351
Excuse me. Hi. I need to look
at some property records.

174
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:44,787
You're gonna have to be
a bit more specific than that.

175
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:48,624
I just inherited a house so I need
to check some records for an appraisal.

176
00:27:48,724 --> 00:27:52,395
- Address?
- 1542 Chanley Street.

177
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,632
It's Kaiser Gardens.

178
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:59,001
Oh.

179
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:48,305
Hi.

180
00:30:48,905 --> 00:30:52,542
I'm sorry to show up unannounced. I have
something I need to speak to you about.

181
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:54,777
Yeah, that's okay.

182
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:57,993
You don't look so good. Are you okay?

183
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,013
I'll be fine.

184
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,088
I stopped by the county clerk's office today.

185
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:08,024
What did you find out?

186
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:12,162
That the house has been in my family
since before they kept records.

187
00:31:13,062 --> 00:31:17,299
Earliest name on the deed
is from 1876. Jacob Kaiser.

188
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:19,635
That's interesting.

189
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,974
Do you have any information
you want to add on to that?

190
00:31:25,924 --> 00:31:28,760
- I don't know what you're getting at.
- I think you do.

191
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:35,417
There was a note in the file...

192
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:39,122
...and the handwriting matches your
handwriting from Billings's appraisal.

193
00:31:39,722 --> 00:31:41,324
Well, I don't like being ambushed.

194
00:31:41,424 --> 00:31:43,826
What is it about the property
that you're so interested in?

195
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:45,428
Okay.

196
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:47,797
Please.

197
00:31:48,981 --> 00:31:50,783
Answer me.

198
00:31:52,468 --> 00:31:54,470
My brother died in that house.

199
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,950
So whatever sick, twisted thing you people
have going on, I'm gonna figure it out.

200
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,613
- I told you I only found that out...
- You must know something.

201
00:32:00,713 --> 00:32:02,875
At this point you know more than I do.

202
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,316
My brother wasn't the only one.

203
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:11,370
Fifty-three people have gone missing
from that property in the last 125 years.

204
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,457
The appraiser said the cops searched the
place top to bottom. They found nothing.

205
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,026
Yeah, well, that's what this town
keeps on telling itself.

206
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:19,361
You think my uncle did it?

207
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,115
I think it's something worse.

208
00:32:23,732 --> 00:32:25,535
You think it's haunted.

209
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,638
- You don't?
- I don't care.

210
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:33,712
I wanna sell it and get the hell
out of this godforsaken town.

211
00:32:33,812 --> 00:32:36,278
Well, I'm gonna find my answers.

212
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:39,954
And if you end up being one
of those answers, so help me God.

213
00:32:42,017 --> 00:32:44,353
Thomas? Thomas?

214
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:47,256
Thomas, wake up. Thomas, can you hear me?

215
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:49,558
Help! Thomas.

216
00:32:49,658 --> 00:32:52,395
Thomas, wake up. Thomas can you hear me?

217
00:32:52,495 --> 00:32:55,567
Help! Somebody! Thomas!

218
00:32:58,067 --> 00:33:00,002
What's wrong with him?

219
00:33:00,102 --> 00:33:04,140
Panic attack. I gave him
something to calm him down.

220
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,979
<i>Come to me.</i>

221
00:33:22,524 --> 00:33:24,333
You're back.

222
00:33:24,793 --> 00:33:26,796
Only in my dreams.

223
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,566
This realm is yours as much as it is mine.

224
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,702
What about in waking life?

225
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,839
You will be the one to set me free.

226
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:40,242
You are lord of the land
which I am cursed to.

227
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:44,413
You may be mortal, Thomas...

228
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:47,349
...but in the physical realm
you have great power.

229
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:50,600
The Veiled Demon knows this.

230
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,555
The Veiled Demon?
Is that what I saw yesterday?

231
00:33:53,655 --> 00:33:57,126
She is merely an intruder on your domain.

232
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,229
She is what made me flee.

233
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:05,313
Until her curse is lifted,
we can't truly be together.

234
00:34:05,413 --> 00:34:08,271
And to lift the curse,
I need to what? Defeat her?

235
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:11,940
You are the heir apparent
of the Kaiser bloodline.

236
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,245
Only you can wake me.

237
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:20,250
You are away from me, away from your land.

238
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,718
Yeah.

239
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:26,456
When you are separated
from me, your body withers.

240
00:34:27,296 --> 00:34:29,746
It is the same curse that imprisons me.

241
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:34,731
The curse is real, Thomas.

242
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:38,037
You are in Kaiser Gardens?

243
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:40,436
Remember the bloodline will awaken me...

244
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,415
...and open all doors.

245
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,821
You must wake up now.

246
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:07,262
Hi. I, uh...

247
00:35:07,362 --> 00:35:09,365
...brought you some food.

248
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:13,469
- What time is it?
- Last I checked, five p.m.

249
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:37,693
Here.

250
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,668
What happened?

251
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:51,073
Well, you passed out at the bar
and then I took you to the hospital.

252
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:53,682
The doctor said there was nothing
wrong with you, physically...

253
00:35:53,782 --> 00:35:57,369
...and then you started screaming
that you needed to be taken back here.

254
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:00,916
You were fine once you got back to the house.

255
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:03,993
- Shit.
- Yeah.

256
00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:07,750
Um, did you ever figure out
what happened to the lights?

257
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,892
They work on and off.

258
00:36:10,742 --> 00:36:13,453
Especially at night,
everything seems to stop working.

259
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,401
My files.

260
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:26,375
Why you helping me now?

261
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,344
Mutual interest.

262
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:31,970
You seem to be stuck with this place and...

263
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:34,779
...I want to find my brother.

264
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:38,537
You think he's here?

265
00:36:39,972 --> 00:36:44,059
I was living in Oregon
when I got the phone call.

266
00:36:45,794 --> 00:36:48,030
It was hell on my parents...

267
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,100
...but we spent months searching...

268
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:54,729
...which is why I came here.

269
00:36:55,437 --> 00:36:59,556
I was a realtor in Portland so I figured...

270
00:36:59,656 --> 00:37:01,944
...it was my way onto the property.

271
00:37:06,248 --> 00:37:09,721
His name is Luke. He was...

272
00:37:10,648 --> 00:37:13,122
...supposedly with his girlfriend.

273
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:16,692
A witness said he saw him walking this way.

274
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:19,895
<i>They were out one drunken night.</i>

275
00:37:20,495 --> 00:37:23,305
<i>They must have come to the house on a dare.</i>

276
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,972
That was the last time he was seen.

277
00:37:30,872 --> 00:37:33,542
I am completely obsessed with this place.

278
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:36,779
Every few years another person goes missing.

279
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:42,484
Thomas, you said last night that... Jacob
Kaiser is the oldest holder of this property.

280
00:37:42,584 --> 00:37:46,021
Well, two generations later, Michael Kaiser
was the owner of this property.

281
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:49,525
Earlier 1900s he tried to burn this place
into the ground. He died a few days later.

282
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:54,496
Body just shut down.
From what I could figure out...

283
00:37:54,796 --> 00:37:59,167
...with your family on this side,
is that it's all pretty much the same story.

284
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:03,505
Accidental deaths, suicides. Males, shut-ins.

285
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,907
I believe...

286
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:10,629
...that it has to do with this house.

287
00:38:13,181 --> 00:38:15,263
Some sort of...

288
00:38:15,363 --> 00:38:18,404
...supernatural connection.

289
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:24,927
Let's say I'm stuck
in this mansion until I die.

290
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,632
There has to be a way to break
the spell, or curse, or whatever.

291
00:38:30,732 --> 00:38:32,881
You think it's a curse?

292
00:38:32,981 --> 00:38:35,054
I'm entertaining the possibility.

293
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:38,793
But cops, us...

294
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:40,929
...have searched the house top to bottom.

295
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:43,912
That's why I wanted
to see your uncle's letter.

296
00:38:44,262 --> 00:38:48,351
There has to be something there
that connects your family's bloodline.

297
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,519
Bloodline.

298
00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:55,190
- Thomas?
- Come on.

299
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,575
Follow me. I have the letter.

300
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:03,298
Be careful.

301
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:09,221
This is it.

302
00:39:15,357 --> 00:39:18,013
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

303
00:39:18,613 --> 00:39:22,071
So Billings was certain there was
more space behind this wall.

304
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:27,456
And your uncle also says here that there are
more rooms below the basement.

305
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:31,528
Here.

306
00:39:33,064 --> 00:39:35,356
Yeah, I tried that. It doesn't move.

307
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:41,871
Hey, is that blood?

308
00:39:44,306 --> 00:39:46,108
That's what I thought.

309
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:55,926
Bloodline.

310
00:40:15,036 --> 00:40:17,506
Holy shit.

311
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:19,675
Yeah.

312
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,811
- Looks like there's a tunnel.
- Maybe.

313
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:58,497
Look at this.

314
00:41:06,928 --> 00:41:08,757
It's a journal.

315
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:13,696
What are you doing?

316
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,999
In his letter Clive said the seals
are meant to keep people out.

317
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,568
You.

318
00:41:25,197 --> 00:41:27,355
Where's my uncle's letter?

319
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,782
The handwriting matches,
but I don't understand what it says.

320
00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:36,951
Neither do I. I have no idea
what language this is.

321
00:41:39,604 --> 00:41:41,473
What was that?

322
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:56,004
Come on. Let's go.

323
00:42:05,997 --> 00:42:08,800
- Did you see that?
- No.

324
00:42:11,853 --> 00:42:15,323
Thomas. Thomas, Thomas.

325
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,677
Oh, shit!

326
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,163
- Looks like we have to go through them.
- Slowly.

327
00:43:04,472 --> 00:43:08,359
- Did you just see that?
- Yeah, it's like it didn't want to hurt me.

328
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:10,537
There. Come on!

329
00:43:13,315 --> 00:43:15,517
Okay, go. Go.

330
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,224
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. Hold this.

331
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:25,561
I don't see any more.

332
00:43:26,661 --> 00:43:29,131
- Give me the book.
- Okay.

333
00:43:37,024 --> 00:43:38,607
Okay.

334
00:44:08,753 --> 00:44:09,772
Linda.

335
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:49,878
- Do you still have the journal?
- Yes.

336
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:53,081
- Where are the keys?
- Oh, shit!

337
00:44:54,349 --> 00:44:57,152
- Richard.
- Get in.

338
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,862
- Go!
- All right, where?

339
00:45:10,632 --> 00:45:13,451
This is an unexpected way
to meet you officially.

340
00:45:13,551 --> 00:45:16,070
I tried calling you on the cell phone,
but no luck...

341
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,606
...so I decided to take a look
at that property...

342
00:45:18,706 --> 00:45:21,600
...that you've been yammering on
about for the last few months.

343
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,632
- Excellent timing, Richard.
- Something else you want to tell me?

344
00:45:25,732 --> 00:45:27,291
No.

345
00:45:27,798 --> 00:45:29,686
Listen, uh...

346
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,421
Sorry. Richard Meyers.
Glad to make your acquaintance.

347
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:36,964
Richard is an expert in supernatural
phenomenons, specifically demonic.

348
00:45:37,064 --> 00:45:41,730
Well, paranormal cleric. I perform rituals
sanctified by the Paranormal Community...

349
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,107
...Catholic Church, to name a few.

350
00:45:44,532 --> 00:45:45,944
Great.

351
00:45:46,768 --> 00:45:48,036
So what were you running from?

352
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:50,839
Something Thomas did not
believe in five minutes ago.

353
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:53,041
Come on, let's go to my place.
I'll explain it to you.

354
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:54,346
All right.

355
00:46:13,528 --> 00:46:16,765
Well, welcome to my place.

356
00:46:17,465 --> 00:46:20,068
There is something
that I want to show you guys.

357
00:46:26,007 --> 00:46:29,077
- You took all of these?
- Yep.

358
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:33,715
I've been documenting the paranormal activity
surrounding the Kaiser Gardens.

359
00:46:33,815 --> 00:46:36,885
I figured out that if you use
a very powerful lens...

360
00:46:36,985 --> 00:46:40,970
...and you open the shutter for a really
long time that you can pick up on that.

361
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,526
See these... these spirits...

362
00:46:45,626 --> 00:46:49,397
...some people call them
demons or ghosts or djinns...

363
00:46:49,497 --> 00:46:52,881
- ...but they are everywhere.
- Djinns?

364
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:55,470
Well, there are three kinds of beings.

365
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:58,673
There are the angels
that are created by light.

366
00:46:58,773 --> 00:47:04,818
Humans are created by clay.
And djinns are created by fire.

367
00:47:05,346 --> 00:47:07,215
- Like right there.
- Yes.

368
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:10,318
So that thing we saw in the house,
the dark figure moving in and out?

369
00:47:10,418 --> 00:47:12,820
Most likely that was a djinn.

370
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,625
They mostly appear as a shadow
or as a black dog.

371
00:47:17,725 --> 00:47:20,630
They can be evil, or good.

372
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,331
And they can take possession
of many things...

373
00:47:24,431 --> 00:47:26,367
...such as inanimate objects.

374
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:31,206
But like angels, they exist
in a supernatural realm...

375
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,709
...and like humans they have free will.

376
00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:38,980
Free will.

377
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,783
So they're behind
what's happening at the house?

378
00:47:41,883 --> 00:47:43,752
And I'm stuck with them?

379
00:47:44,452 --> 00:47:48,123
- I hate this goddamn house.
- I don't blame you.

380
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:53,161
At least we know what we're dealing with.

381
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:57,495
It doesn't matter. Nothing does.
My life is over. Don't you get it?

382
00:47:57,595 --> 00:48:01,503
- What are you talkin' about?
- Richard, he gets a sickness.

383
00:48:01,603 --> 00:48:06,865
We think if he spends more than a few days
away from the property, he'll die.

384
00:48:06,965 --> 00:48:10,845
So you're cosmically bound to the property?

385
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:13,715
That's interesting.

386
00:48:14,665 --> 00:48:17,886
You know, I've heard about this before
but I've never actually seen it.

387
00:48:17,986 --> 00:48:19,788
This is exciting.

388
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:22,974
You...

389
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:26,912
May I please borrow
the keys to your car, Richard?

390
00:48:27,012 --> 00:48:29,236
Oh, well, it...

391
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,607
...needs gas.

392
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:47,435
Thanks a lot, Uncle Clive!

393
00:48:49,117 --> 00:48:50,652
Shit!

394
00:49:21,316 --> 00:49:24,953
I'm not tied to the property.
I'm tied to her, Briar Rose.

395
00:49:25,053 --> 00:49:27,122
- Who's Briar Rose?
- I don't really know.

396
00:49:27,222 --> 00:49:31,659
I've dreamt about her my entire adult life,
always in Kaiser Gardens, always asleep.

397
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:35,630
Only when I inherited the property
did she wake up, but only in the dream.

398
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,712
She said her body
is somewhere on the property...

399
00:49:37,812 --> 00:49:41,035
...and the only place we haven't looked
is deeper in those basement rooms.

400
00:49:41,135 --> 00:49:44,263
- You say these are dreams?
- She also mentioned a demon.

401
00:49:46,741 --> 00:49:50,779
I saw this in a nightmare.
Rose called it the Veiled Demon.

402
00:49:53,498 --> 00:49:55,617
I've seen this face before.

403
00:49:56,317 --> 00:50:00,321
In ancient drawings in my trips to Jordan.

404
00:50:00,421 --> 00:50:03,625
She's called Shaytan Al-Hayalshabat...

405
00:50:03,725 --> 00:50:07,128
...which translates into the Veiled Demon.

406
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,699
In Greek mythology
she's the female version of Erebus.

407
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:15,010
This must be the source of the haunting.

408
00:50:17,905 --> 00:50:21,311
I think if we can find Briar Rose...

409
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:24,613
...and wake her up, it will break the curse.

410
00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:36,557
So, uh, does it say anything
about Rose or how to save her?

411
00:50:36,957 --> 00:50:40,495
I don't know.
It's in a coded ancient language.

412
00:50:40,595 --> 00:50:43,498
We're gonna have to get somebody
to help us translate this book.

413
00:50:43,598 --> 00:50:47,335
- Well, you have your ex-boyfriend.
- No, Richard. He's not my ex-boyfriend.

414
00:50:47,435 --> 00:50:50,693
I went on two dates with him.
It was two dates. It was like a deal.

415
00:50:50,793 --> 00:50:54,609
- He was gonna help me with some things.
- You said the deal was one date.

416
00:50:54,709 --> 00:50:56,911
The details are not important.

417
00:50:59,747 --> 00:51:01,951
As I live and breathe.

418
00:51:02,051 --> 00:51:05,787
Hi, Daniel. Thanks for taking us
on such short notice.

419
00:51:05,887 --> 00:51:07,935
Sure thing.

420
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,266
Richard, it's nice
to finally meet you in person.

421
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:21,246
It's nice to see everybody in the flesh.

422
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:25,974
- It's like a family reunion.
- Ah, and who's this? Your boyfriend?

423
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,675
- He looks a little sickly.
- Daniel!

424
00:51:28,775 --> 00:51:30,945
I kid, because I love.

425
00:51:31,045 --> 00:51:32,847
Come on in.

426
00:51:43,991 --> 00:51:46,494
Welcome to my secret lair.
I knocked a few walls down...

427
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:48,797
...rewired the whole place myself.

428
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,465
Pretty unique.

429
00:52:01,008 --> 00:52:03,478
Oh, here. Let me show you.

430
00:52:08,566 --> 00:52:10,685
You see, it starts...

431
00:52:10,785 --> 00:52:14,689
- ...right here, it gets dicey.
- All this writing looks like Aramaic script.

432
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:17,158
- Right.
- Oldest surviving Arabic grammar.

433
00:52:17,258 --> 00:52:20,094
Same as the last thing you gave me.
This could take a while.

434
00:52:20,194 --> 00:52:23,631
- How long will it take?
- How long?

435
00:52:24,531 --> 00:52:28,102
How long? Where'd you get this guy from?

436
00:52:28,202 --> 00:52:30,081
For your info, smart guy...

437
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:33,441
...I occasionally work for the government
doing stuff I can't talk about.

438
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:37,615
The program that we're using to figure out
this ancient journal, I wrote it.

439
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:40,783
Okay. Daniel.

440
00:52:42,383 --> 00:52:44,619
Yeah, uh, we have to get him back
to the property...

441
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:46,754
...or else his body's gonna shut down.

442
00:52:46,854 --> 00:52:49,917
Oh, bummer. Sorry.

443
00:52:50,017 --> 00:52:53,894
Daniel, it's gonna be a long night.
Let's just have a drink here.

444
00:52:55,777 --> 00:53:00,435
It's an Irish recipe. I... made it myself.

445
00:53:05,672 --> 00:53:08,175
I call this program the Cypher Wizard.

446
00:53:08,275 --> 00:53:11,512
It uses some of the same logarithms
I use in code breaking for the government.

447
00:53:11,612 --> 00:53:13,748
These ancient writings
are essentially a kind of code...

448
00:53:13,848 --> 00:53:17,318
...with symbols and double meanings.
So you need to translate on two levels...

449
00:53:17,418 --> 00:53:20,511
...the language or symbols, and what
those symbols are really trying to say...

450
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:22,724
..in the context of the symbols around it.

451
00:53:22,884 --> 00:53:25,696
So how did this ancient book
get into the house?

452
00:53:25,796 --> 00:53:28,830
I don't know how it got there.
I can only tell you what it says.

453
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:32,967
Now whoever wrote this journal,
no doubt one of your ancestors...

454
00:53:33,067 --> 00:53:37,872
...has got an unparalleled knowledge
of both the language and the supernatural.

455
00:53:39,673 --> 00:53:42,077
All right, let's do some work.

456
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,434
Thomas? Door's open. You home?

457
00:54:30,057 --> 00:54:32,743
Thomas, electricity still isn't working.

458
00:54:55,316 --> 00:54:56,344
Thomas?

459
00:55:22,243 --> 00:55:25,313
Thomas? Ya home?

460
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:55,677
Hello?

461
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,796
What are you doing here?

462
00:56:50,297 --> 00:56:51,699
Thomas?

463
00:56:52,499 --> 00:56:54,302
Is that you?

464
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,570
This isn't funny.

465
00:57:19,772 --> 00:57:21,362
Hey.

466
00:57:22,062 --> 00:57:24,198
I brought you some coffee.

467
00:57:24,298 --> 00:57:26,100
Thank you.

468
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:32,206
- Do you mind if I sit?
- No, please.

469
00:57:38,946 --> 00:57:41,582
How's your shoulder?

470
00:57:43,968 --> 00:57:45,787
It's seen better days.

471
00:57:46,587 --> 00:57:48,622
For what it's worth...

472
00:57:50,707 --> 00:57:52,978
...I'm really glad that you're here...

473
00:57:54,228 --> 00:57:56,053
...sharing this...

474
00:57:56,516 --> 00:57:59,244
...horrifying experience with me.

475
00:58:01,835 --> 00:58:03,742
At least you have a choice in the matter.

476
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:10,315
You guys don't even need to be here.

477
00:58:11,595 --> 00:58:13,681
Yet you are.

478
00:58:14,281 --> 00:58:16,158
Back in the city...

479
00:58:17,886 --> 00:58:20,171
...I was just going through the motions.

480
00:58:22,022 --> 00:58:24,825
I didn't care about anything or anyone.

481
00:58:24,925 --> 00:58:27,762
Yeah, broken heart?

482
00:58:28,262 --> 00:58:29,747
No?

483
00:58:30,197 --> 00:58:32,046
Shit job?

484
00:58:33,851 --> 00:58:35,736
I was engaged.

485
00:58:42,776 --> 00:58:44,612
She got sick...

486
00:58:46,997 --> 00:58:50,267
...and by the time they found
the cancer it was too late.

487
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:55,076
And that was three years ago.

488
00:58:55,456 --> 00:58:57,858
I am so sorry.

489
00:59:01,563 --> 00:59:05,600
I used her death as an excuse to check out.

490
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:09,446
I lost my job...

491
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,982
...my house, everything.

492
00:59:15,008 --> 00:59:18,081
A friend graciously put me in a cubicle...

493
00:59:18,816 --> 00:59:22,116
...but reality never quite set in.

494
00:59:24,851 --> 00:59:28,489
You on the other hand, you lose a brother...

495
00:59:30,124 --> 00:59:32,628
...and you become a regular Nancy Drew.

496
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,092
Are you okay?

497
00:59:43,837 --> 00:59:46,273
- You okay?
- Yeah.

498
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:51,846
It looks like I've traded one
shitty existence for another.

499
00:59:53,647 --> 00:59:55,884
Yeah, but we're close...

500
00:59:57,484 --> 01:00:00,121
...to finding the answers and the truth.

501
01:00:00,421 --> 01:00:02,690
I've had enough answers for one day.

502
01:00:25,045 --> 01:00:26,947
It's just a lot at once...

503
01:00:27,047 --> 01:00:29,984
...and I still don't know
how Rose fits into the picture.

504
01:00:31,785 --> 01:00:34,221
Rose, the girl from your dreams?

505
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:36,590
We have this connection.

506
01:00:39,393 --> 01:00:41,228
I can't explain it.

507
01:00:42,563 --> 01:00:45,893
They're more than dreams. They're so real.

508
01:00:45,993 --> 01:00:48,869
- And after what happened today...
- Wait, uh...

509
01:00:50,737 --> 01:00:54,738
Are you saying that you think
that you have some sort of...

510
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:58,345
...real connection with this Briar Rose?

511
01:00:58,445 --> 01:01:00,014
Maybe.

512
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,988
Okay, um...

513
01:01:09,773 --> 01:01:11,592
Well, uh...

514
01:01:12,393 --> 01:01:14,256
I should, um...

515
01:01:15,545 --> 01:01:17,965
...go. I'm gonna take the couch upstairs.

516
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:20,067
You should get some sleep.

517
01:01:21,902 --> 01:01:23,938
Say hi to Briar Rose for me.

518
01:02:23,764 --> 01:02:25,266
Thomas.

519
01:02:27,134 --> 01:02:28,602
Yo.

520
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,639
We got some new intel, bro.

521
01:02:39,279 --> 01:02:40,314
What do we got?

522
01:02:40,414 --> 01:02:43,498
The journal was written by one of your
earliest ancestors, William Kaiser...

523
01:02:43,598 --> 01:02:45,720
- ...during the Crusades.
- Shit's old.

524
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,907
This is the first page of the journal.
"I, William Kaiser...

525
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:53,153
"...have wrought upon my family
a debt which shall never be repaid.

526
01:02:53,253 --> 01:02:57,731
The sacrifice of a virgin bride to Iblis."

527
01:02:59,299 --> 01:03:01,501
In Islam, the devil is known as Iblis.

528
01:03:01,601 --> 01:03:04,901
He's the first to refuse to bow to Adam.

529
01:03:05,001 --> 01:03:07,908
- Essentially it's Satan.
- Well, Azazel, yes.

530
01:03:08,008 --> 01:03:12,172
The Quran and the Bible have many
similarities, just different names.

531
01:03:12,272 --> 01:03:15,652
So William had connections
with Rose and Satan?

532
01:03:15,752 --> 01:03:18,051
There. Briar Rose, that's her name, right?

533
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:20,520
She was royalty known for her beauty.

534
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:24,558
A djinn cursed her with a needle that pierced
her skin and put her in eternal sleep.

535
01:03:24,658 --> 01:03:28,094
- Sounds like a fairy tale.
- It must be Iblis who wants her.

536
01:03:28,194 --> 01:03:32,428
Now, if this is real she's alive,
but she's trapped in limbo...

537
01:03:32,528 --> 01:03:34,601
...a slave to the supernatural realm.

538
01:03:34,701 --> 01:03:37,037
The Veiled Demon is the guard
of Rose between these realms.

539
01:03:37,237 --> 01:03:41,174
The only other thing that was deciphered is,
"The blood of our line shall open the gate."

540
01:03:41,274 --> 01:03:43,643
This phrase is next to this picture.

541
01:03:47,147 --> 01:03:48,382
What are you doing?

542
01:03:48,482 --> 01:03:50,918
I'm looking for protective spells
in the original Arabic.

543
01:03:51,018 --> 01:03:53,037
They must be somewhere in here.

544
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:56,994
Are you okay? I think we're
gonna have to get him back.

545
01:03:57,094 --> 01:04:01,095
No, it's too dangerous to go back to
the house. If it's just me we'll be fine.

546
01:04:02,796 --> 01:04:05,632
- Oh, no.
- What?

547
01:04:05,966 --> 01:04:07,348
Billings the appraiser.

548
01:04:07,448 --> 01:04:10,304
All right, it's all right.
We'll be right back.

549
01:04:27,454 --> 01:04:30,550
- Thomas.
- Rose, where am I?

550
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:32,860
You have to move quickly, Thomas.
There's no time left.

551
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,896
When you are away, her evil thrives here.

552
01:04:35,996 --> 01:04:38,833
- <i>Do not trust.</i>
- Just drive straight in.

553
01:04:38,933 --> 01:04:42,069
- I can make it myself.
- No, you can't.

554
01:04:42,369 --> 01:04:44,905
When you confront her in her true form...

555
01:04:45,005 --> 01:04:47,641
...she can do more than haunt
and bestow nightmares.

556
01:04:47,741 --> 01:04:50,407
Your bloodline will no longer protect you.

557
01:04:52,112 --> 01:04:53,613
Stop.

558
01:04:58,118 --> 01:05:01,155
- Are you okay?
- Billings' car.

559
01:05:02,205 --> 01:05:04,057
- You all right?
- Stay here and don't follow me!

560
01:05:04,157 --> 01:05:06,393
Just trust me. Billings!

561
01:05:22,576 --> 01:05:25,512
This is it. This ends right here, right now.

562
01:05:25,612 --> 01:05:27,414
Where are you taking us?

563
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:34,021
Ah, yes.

564
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:38,592
Yes, this is the symbol for Iblis, all right.

565
01:05:39,926 --> 01:05:43,196
- Azazel.
- We should get the cops involved.

566
01:05:43,296 --> 01:05:46,594
There's evidence on the second floor bedroom
that proves that Billings was killed here.

567
01:05:46,694 --> 01:05:48,076
We can't get the cops involved.

568
01:05:48,176 --> 01:05:50,572
Protocol would be to board
this place up for who knows how long.

569
01:05:50,672 --> 01:05:53,907
I'd be booked as a suspect and spend at least
a few nights in jail, and that would not...

570
01:05:54,007 --> 01:05:56,577
We can figure this out for ourselves.

571
01:05:57,511 --> 01:05:59,580
If we just find...

572
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,582
No! What...

573
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,602
Richard, there it is.

574
01:06:24,104 --> 01:06:25,906
That's the gateway.

575
01:06:29,543 --> 01:06:31,305
- Linda.
- Hmm?

576
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:39,253
Now, I, uh... I have this.

577
01:06:39,353 --> 01:06:42,156
- A gun?
- Well, ya never know.

578
01:06:42,956 --> 01:06:44,792
It's best to be prepared.

579
01:06:47,427 --> 01:06:49,696
How well do you know this guy?

580
01:06:49,796 --> 01:06:52,065
You want to tell him to sit this one out?

581
01:06:58,004 --> 01:06:59,840
Watch out.

582
01:07:19,926 --> 01:07:22,334
Well, it knows we're here.

583
01:07:23,463 --> 01:07:25,899
You said you have protection spells, right?

584
01:07:26,299 --> 01:07:28,368
Well, hopefully. I have a few we could use.

585
01:07:28,468 --> 01:07:30,003
Hopefully?

586
01:07:31,054 --> 01:07:34,675
Rose, she said I'm no longer protected
once I'm near this Veiled Demon.

587
01:07:34,775 --> 01:07:38,179
- I could die in here.
- Well, that makes three of us.

588
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,747
Let's go.

589
01:08:13,947 --> 01:08:15,781
Now that was a djinn.

590
01:08:16,453 --> 01:08:17,818
What did you do?

591
01:08:17,918 --> 01:08:21,288
I just banished him back
to the hell he came from.

592
01:08:22,956 --> 01:08:25,771
- Where are you going?
- Well...

593
01:08:26,571 --> 01:08:29,401
...I'm gonna follow him
unless you got a better idea.

594
01:08:43,977 --> 01:08:45,712
What is this place?

595
01:08:45,812 --> 01:08:48,082
Looks like a hospital from hell.

596
01:08:55,255 --> 01:08:58,181
These mannequins are different
from the ones we saw.

597
01:08:58,281 --> 01:09:00,728
It's like someone's been working on them.

598
01:09:02,228 --> 01:09:05,532
It is hiding in here. I can feel it.

599
01:09:11,338 --> 01:09:13,173
Where did it go?

600
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:15,275
I'll check over here.

601
01:10:00,887 --> 01:10:04,578
Luke. My brother, what have they done to you?

602
01:10:45,565 --> 01:10:47,501
That was my brother Luke.

603
01:10:47,601 --> 01:10:51,438
No. No, he left long ago.

604
01:10:51,938 --> 01:10:54,775
This is just an empty vessel.

605
01:11:01,214 --> 01:11:03,083
It's still here.

606
01:11:08,488 --> 01:11:10,324
Let's go get it.

607
01:11:35,715 --> 01:11:37,017
Oh, no.

608
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:43,256
Not yet. This is the final chamber.

609
01:11:43,356 --> 01:11:45,159
And there she is.

610
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,961
The Veiled Demon.

611
01:12:06,045 --> 01:12:11,338
And Briar Rose must be lying asleep
just beyond those doors there.

612
01:12:17,357 --> 01:12:19,492
- How do we get past it?
- Well, I don't know.

613
01:12:19,592 --> 01:12:22,462
We can distract her,
keep her busy for a while...

614
01:12:22,562 --> 01:12:26,633
...but you will have to wake Rose.
She's the only one that can stop this.

615
01:12:26,733 --> 01:12:29,369
- I'm not leaving you guys.
- It's our only choice.

616
01:12:29,469 --> 01:12:32,573
- We're doing this together.
- Just listen to me. We'll keep her busy.

617
01:12:32,673 --> 01:12:35,976
You have to wake the Rose,
whatever happens to us.

618
01:12:36,076 --> 01:12:37,924
You've got to wake her.

619
01:12:52,992 --> 01:12:55,729
I see you.

620
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:58,101
Turn around and face us.

621
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:12,012
Your spells and weapons are useless here.

622
01:13:12,112 --> 01:13:14,381
Are you the maker?

623
01:13:15,081 --> 01:13:18,552
- Did you create these vessels?
- You have a lot to answer for.

624
01:13:19,052 --> 01:13:21,781
All who enter my realm...

625
01:13:21,881 --> 01:13:24,863
...will be punished.

626
01:13:24,963 --> 01:13:29,265
And their souls will be mine.

627
01:13:29,365 --> 01:13:32,857
- I stand here in the name...
- I have the power here...

628
01:13:32,957 --> 01:13:36,259
...as do the other djinns
tasked to stand guard...

629
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:40,440
...when the curse was first brought forth.

630
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:45,211
- Other djinns?
- There are 13 of us.

631
01:13:45,311 --> 01:13:49,082
- Where are they?
- I answer to no mortal.

632
01:13:49,182 --> 01:13:51,217
You will answer to me!

633
01:13:56,856 --> 01:14:01,327
How dare you enter into my domain?

634
01:14:01,527 --> 01:14:03,217
Fools.

635
01:14:06,549 --> 01:14:09,363
Your mortal eyes are blind.

636
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:14,240
It is I who is the protector.

637
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:17,563
Where is the young Kaiser?

638
01:16:41,754 --> 01:16:43,390
Bloodline.

639
01:17:46,385 --> 01:17:48,188
Thank you.

640
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:11,479
Now, the prophecy can be fulfilled.

641
01:18:16,883 --> 01:18:19,519
Your task has been completed.

642
01:18:20,419 --> 01:18:22,645
Mine has just begun.

643
01:18:23,372 --> 01:18:25,842
And I have plans for you.

644
01:18:46,045 --> 01:18:49,482
How dare you think you could come in here...

645
01:18:49,582 --> 01:18:52,585
...and break the curse?

646
01:18:52,685 --> 01:18:56,789
Unleashing the evil will summon the demons...

647
01:18:56,889 --> 01:19:01,026
...of the doomed Kaiser bloodline.

648
01:19:01,126 --> 01:19:02,797
And I...

649
01:19:13,239 --> 01:19:15,508
A thousand years.

650
01:19:21,731 --> 01:19:23,935
I have not forgotten.

651
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:29,022
Rose is evil. You have to stop her.

652
01:19:36,462 --> 01:19:37,874
Linda!

653
01:19:43,369 --> 01:19:47,017
There's a special small taste
of what's to come.

654
01:19:49,058 --> 01:19:51,094
I would kill you...

655
01:19:53,913 --> 01:19:55,916
...but I want you to stay...

656
01:19:56,716 --> 01:20:00,994
...to see all of the darkness
I have to show you.

657
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:58,278
"We are cursed with the souls
of demons in our blood.

658
01:20:58,778 --> 01:21:00,639
They live within us...

659
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:03,761
...using our bodies as their vessels.

660
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:11,829
<i>First comes the nightmares.</i>

661
01:21:13,509 --> 01:21:17,396
<i>Then the sickness begins to take over and
he begins to hear the spirits of the damned.</i>

662
01:21:18,096 --> 01:21:22,502
<i>The souls of the Kaiser generations
seeping into his blood.</i>

663
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:26,940
<i>But be warned that one must never
communicate with any demons...</i>

664
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:31,133
<i>...for you never know
if it is a true beast...</i>

665
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:33,229
<i>...the true evil.</i>

666
01:21:33,629 --> 01:21:37,484
<i>The one who will use our curse
in order to bring about the Qiyamat.</i>

667
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:39,953
<i>The apocalypse.</i>

668
01:21:40,503 --> 01:21:42,522
<i>The end of our world."</i>

669
01:21:49,745 --> 01:21:52,949
Soon, you shall all awaken...

670
01:21:54,217 --> 01:21:56,420
...and bring about...

671
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,791
...my Qiyamat.

672
01:21:59,305 --> 01:22:59,590
