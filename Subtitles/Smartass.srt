2
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,071
Let me get two bindles.

3
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:45,647
And don't fuck with me,
I want the homie price.

4
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:46,749
You hear me?

5
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:50,021
I hear you

6
00:00:50,023 --> 00:00:53,027
on the homie price,
but you ain't no homie,

7
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:57,370
nigger.

8
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:59,475
Ah, I see.

9
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,579
Look what you just did.

10
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:03,850
Say nigger now.

11
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:09,896
Awe, look. You got something
on your shoe, homie.

12
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:11,633
Bitch.

13
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:18,715
You good, baby?

14
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,724
Hugo.

15
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:14,093
Hey, buddy.

16
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:15,664
How's the trap shot business?

17
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,735
These guys are total suckers.

18
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,274
Ya know, I'm still
waiting on my cut

19
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:22,177
from that custom van work I did.

20
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:24,080
It's rough out here,
I got overhead.

21
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:26,619
You're such a shyster.

22
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:27,524
Hey...

23
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:32,164
You cool?

24
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,706
Yeah, you?

25
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:36,941
Yeah.

26
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:40,247
Hugo, come on, man.

27
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:43,087
You think you'll get
to ride in a lowrider?

28
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:44,656
Maybe.

29
00:02:44,658 --> 00:02:46,694
That'd be cool.

30
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:49,100
Yeah.

31
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,372
Hey, get off my property!

32
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:06,247
Ninja skills, try me, bitch.

33
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:07,215
Give that back.

34
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:09,387
Nope, it's mine now.

35
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,524
What are you
gonna do with that?

36
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:12,627
Keep it like a prize.

37
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,663
Otto, can you help me?

38
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:15,332
I almost got this, man.

39
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:17,070
Is that a condom machine?

40
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:18,573
That's disgusting.

41
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:20,376
Seriously, dude, if you
don't shut the fuck up,

42
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:22,046
I'm gonna rip your
fuckin' throat out.

43
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:25,152
Hey, thought smack was
supposed to make you like,

44
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:27,556
sleepy and nice,
not a douchetard.

45
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:29,128
You have room to talk.

46
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,331
You're like the
biggest asshole alive.

47
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,500
Me?

48
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:32,634
Yes, you!

49
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:36,609
Fuck yes.

50
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:38,012
Motivational speaker.

51
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:39,448
I might kill you.

52
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,953
Awe, then
you'd be so lonely.

53
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:43,157
No, I wouldn't.

54
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,194
What the fuck you
lookin' at, motherfucker?

55
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:47,700
You want some of me, bitch?

56
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:49,469
Alright, motherfucker.

57
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:51,173
I should be a gang.

58
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:52,643
Just you, huh?

59
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:53,745
Mm-hmm.

60
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:55,449
One person can't be a gang.

61
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:57,251
Hey, no crushing
my dreams, okay?

62
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:59,123
Okay, Fred, you're a gang.

63
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,659
What would your name be?

64
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,566
That's a good question.

65
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:06,739
I don't know yet.

66
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,502
Lobo.

67
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,483
Look, Efe, I can explain.

68
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:31,523
All you can do now is listen.

69
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,627
We have no place
for you here, ese.

70
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,800
Your coming here
disrupts my peace

71
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:40,809
and I, Lobo,
I'm a peaceful man.

72
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:42,645
Wait, wait, Poco Efe,
please, just wait.

73
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:45,284
Begging ain't gonna
do you no good, homie.

74
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:48,659
$50,000, just
$50,000 by tomorrow.

75
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:50,695
Come on, Efe,
a little disruption

76
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:53,734
and my protection is
worth at least $50,000.

77
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:55,638
Trust me, I'm good for it, Efe.

78
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,841
Shit'll be picked up
at my brother's place

79
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:58,377
in Morieto tonight.

80
00:06:58,379 --> 00:06:59,717
Just needs to be trailed.

81
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:06,430
I'll give you 24 hours
for your 50,000.

82
00:07:08,702 --> 00:07:10,337
And I'll take one of those.

83
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,242
Come on, Efe.

84
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:14,744
Do me a favor.

85
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:17,316
You want a favor?

86
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,640
You got 24 hours, ese.

87
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:57,399
Thanks.

88
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:58,768
My money, man, don't
be trippin', homie!

89
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,769
Back the fuck up.

90
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,006
What's going on, Z?

91
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:03,310
Uh, there's like
a disagreement

92
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:05,415
and a lot of racial slurs.

93
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,753
The fuck is this?

94
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,458
Nothing, gosh.

95
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,729
So we should probably,
ya know, get outta here

96
00:08:11,731 --> 00:08:12,997
- 'cause this...
- Yo, you trippin', homie!

97
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,834
Yo, you need to
back up off me.

98
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,739
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Freddie, Freddie.

99
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:18,609
Say somethin'!

100
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:21,482
I'm so over this shit.

101
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:22,483
Going back to Vermont.

102
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:23,686
Say somethin', homie!

103
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:25,557
- Say somethin'!
- What?

104
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,693
Chuchu, please
they're gonna kill me

105
00:08:26,695 --> 00:08:28,529
and I need your help, baby.

106
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:29,665
Babe!

107
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:30,867
I'm here.

108
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:33,674
Lobo, I miss you.

109
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:35,076
Well, you're never
gonna fuckin' see me again

110
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:36,645
if you don't fuckin' help me!

111
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:39,417
Why are you yelling?

112
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,088
'Cause he bit
my fuckin' finger off

113
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,526
and he's gonna let
these niggas kill me

114
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:43,528
if I don't get him this money.

115
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,529
Lobo.

116
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:45,564
Fuck, baby, what?

117
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,903
Nobody's gonna kill you.

118
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:50,039
Nobody's gonna kill you.

119
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,710
Just fuckin' help me.

120
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:53,379
Jose should already be there,
just make sure

121
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:54,783
they stay with the
fuckin' problem.

122
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,420
Okay.

123
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:57,823
Fucking fine, fuck.

124
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:59,459
I've only got 24 hours.

125
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:02,700
- Chuchu!
- Come on, kill me, puta!

126
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:04,804
Kill me, kill me, come on, hey!

127
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:06,040
Puto!

128
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,710
Oh, almost!

129
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,884
I'll shine your shit
right up your ass!

130
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,723
Give it to me.

131
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:15,826
Oh, you bitch!

132
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:17,163
Puto, fuck you!

133
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,732
Fuck, shit.

134
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:25,446
Anybody got better
shit than Paolo, huh?

135
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:28,552
Now that is what you
call a loaded question

136
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:30,157
'cause I,

137
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,194
you wanna hear no, but then
that's a suspect answer

138
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:36,868
because I know that
you wanna hear it.

139
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,119
Sit down.
What are you doing?

140
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:48,092
Alright, now can
I get the stuff?

141
00:09:48,094 --> 00:09:50,497
Yes.

142
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:51,535
Yes, you can.

143
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:54,942
Alright, I'll
wait for you here.

144
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:05,932
- You're fucked up.
- You're fucked up.

145
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:10,942
I like him.

146
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,613
Okay, man, I'm done.

147
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,082
I'm done with you
fuckin' bitches.

148
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:17,286
You say that you like
my friend, Donny,

149
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:18,589
well, it's your lucky day.

150
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:20,827
Stand up, you fucking cunt.

151
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,830
Hey, Donny, take her,
she's yours.

152
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,267
Fuckin' shit.

153
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,604
What the fuck are
you doin' to me here?

154
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:28,609
Fuck.

155
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:30,947
Here ya go, I'll have the rest
for you tomorrow, alright?

156
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:32,082
You're a good boy, Donny.

157
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,921
Thanks.

158
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:35,623
I hope nothing bad happens
to you between these times.

159
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,227
You see, why you
gotta say it like that

160
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:38,630
'cause now I think
you want something bad

161
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:39,631
to happen to me.

162
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:40,667
No, I don't.

163
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:42,304
Yes, you do.

164
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:43,740
No.

165
00:10:43,742 --> 00:10:44,775
No, I don't.

166
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,078
Yes, you do, man.

167
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,346
Way to fuckin' creep

168
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:48,851
I'm leavin'.

169
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:49,853
Hey, hey, hey,
take Chuchu with you.

170
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:51,591
It's my gift.

171
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,159
No, no, no, no, she's
like fuckin' half dead.

172
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,796
I don't want her, alright,
you keep her, please.

173
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:56,801
Paolo does not take no
for an answer and, um,

174
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:57,935
I don't want her anymore.

175
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:00,709
So, no Chuchu, no loan.

176
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:03,915
Ah, fuck.

177
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:04,951
Alright, fuck, fine,
I'll take her.

178
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:05,952
Come on.

179
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:06,954
Hey, Donny!

180
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:08,825
Yeah?

181
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:10,695
- I like you.
- What the fuck does that mean?

182
00:11:10,697 --> 00:11:12,732
You like Venice too, look
how she fuckin' ended up.

183
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:17,008
Correction, my friend.

184
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,278
I love Venice.

185
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,284
I only like you.

186
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:23,122
Right, yeah, of course.

187
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:25,326
Alright, come on, let's go.

188
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:27,296
Let's go.

189
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:28,969
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

190
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,706
Hey.

191
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,943
Taking his bag, alright?

192
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:35,112
It's got the papers in it.

193
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:36,883
Hey, I'll go with.

194
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:38,886
Z, tell Otto I got
kidnapped by aliens.

195
00:11:38,888 --> 00:11:39,790
Okay.

196
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,811
Hey.

197
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:52,347
What?

198
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:53,784
What were you gonna say?

199
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:56,055
Uh, just that,

200
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,493
I'm glad that you're
traveling with.

201
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:01,435
Well, it was either
you or Air Force One, so.

202
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:53,138
Hey.

203
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,307
What's up?

204
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:55,478
Come here for a minute.

205
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:06,934
Ooh, you're like a
fuckin' terrorist.

206
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,402
You're comin' with me.

207
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:09,874
That's exactly what
a terrorist would say.

208
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,476
We're going to Burger Bomb.

209
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:13,447
Oh, why didn't you just
say that in the first place?

210
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:14,351
Bye, Nick.

211
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:18,327
You have work to do.

212
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,963
Hey, Donny.

213
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:39,200
Hey, Otto.

214
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,503
She dead?

215
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:42,372
- Her, no.
- She looks dead, dude.

216
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:44,143
You can't say that
'cause she's not dead.

217
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:46,014
- Oh, she's not dead?
- No.

218
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:48,085
- Where'd you get her?
- She was a gift.

219
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,056
- Oh, she was a gift, huh?
- Yeah.

220
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:51,259
Think when she dies,
they're gonna, I don't know,

221
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:52,728
give you a new one?

222
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,164
Yeah, see, I don't
know why she said that

223
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,634
'cause she's not gonna die.

224
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:57,438
They got shit
goin' on by the stairs.

225
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,207
Yeah? Otto, what's
going on back there?

226
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:00,243
Yeah, Donny, she's
like grabbing onto her

227
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:01,246
fuckin' head, dude.

228
00:14:01,248 --> 00:14:02,349
Let her go.

229
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,351
Let her go.
Walk, dude.

230
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:04,720
Let her go.

231
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:06,122
Take her up,
man, get her inside.

232
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:07,993
What the fuck?

233
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:09,160
Sorry.

234
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:10,197
It's cool, brother.

235
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:11,167
See you around.

236
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:15,107
Let's go.

237
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:16,276
Yeah.

238
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:18,448
Still think she's gonna die.

239
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,019
She probably will.

240
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:22,254
Hey.

241
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:23,292
Yo.

242
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,398
Nick, meet Chuchu.

243
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,736
Chuchu, you say hello to Nick.

244
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:31,607
Nice, real sweetheart.

245
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,244
Now, Nick, you
gotta promise me.

246
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:34,648
You gotta be careful
with this stuff

247
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,083
because it's gonna
make your face drip off

248
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,720
in like five minutes.

249
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:39,658
Not that that's a bad
thing, by the way.

250
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,594
That clean, huh?

251
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:44,668
Yeah, the guy's a
fuckin' psycho, dude. You know?

252
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,704
You know, he made me take her
if I wanted to buy his shit.

253
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:49,577
Nick, the dude fuckin'
gave me a human being.

254
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:52,483
Obviously I did because the
dude's fuckin' scary, ya know?

255
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:56,125
So, Donny, I have a favor.

256
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:57,695
I didn't come up
with all the money.

257
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,333
Uh, shit.

258
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:03,672
That kinda makes me a
little nervous because

259
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:05,677
the dude was sketchin' out
about nothing bad happening,

260
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,816
now you're telling me you
only got half his money, Nick.

261
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:09,586
Say yes, Donny.
You know I'm good for it.

262
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:11,223
If you're not cut
out for this shit,

263
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:12,591
go get a job at a carwash.

264
00:15:12,593 --> 00:15:14,496
Will you just take a
minute and just listen

265
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,566
to the words that are comin'
outta your mouth, please?

266
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:19,738
Look, my guy is a
trust fund surfer.

267
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,711
It'll be fine, just
meet me at the beach

268
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,916
around 10 and I'll
have the rest of it.

269
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:25,518
Yeah, right, meet at the
beach at 10 because

270
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,854
nothing bad ever happens
at the beach, right?

271
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:28,525
Donny!

272
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,195
You know, we're up.

273
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,198
I'm fine, right?

274
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,202
I'm fine, fuck, I'll do it,

275
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:36,276
but only fuckin'
because it's you.

276
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:59,755
Come on, buddy, you
gotta eat something.

277
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:03,395
Can't just survive off
of donuts and drugs.

278
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:04,765
I drink.

279
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:07,270
Z, Yoohoo is barely
considered a drink.

280
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:08,473
You're crazy.

281
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:10,878
Yoohoo is wizard milk.

282
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,815
It's wizard milk.

283
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:16,557
I'm getting you a burger
and you're gonna eat it, okay?

284
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,728
Hey!

285
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,701
You're gonna eat it
'cause I love you.

286
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:56,339
I don't want you
to hook up with Nick.

287
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:58,076
Ugh, what do you care?

288
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,548
It's just a bad idea.
I care.

289
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,392
I mean, he's cute and I'm
pretty sure he likes me.

290
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:07,928
Guys like him never like me.

291
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,799
They always like the

292
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:12,905
douchey California counter
girls of the world.

293
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,008
Not true.

294
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,848
Nope, it's definitely true.

295
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:20,720
What the fuck, Z?

296
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:22,124
Excuse me, do
you have a warrant?

297
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:24,028
Zandar Phillips
gave us permission

298
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,165
to search the vehicle, miss.

299
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,405
Zandar, where the
hell are you from?

300
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:30,007
- He's from Connecticut.
- I know.

301
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:32,715
Mommy and Daddy Phillips
are gonna be pissed.

302
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:39,994
Whose is this?

303
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:42,598
It's mine, actually.

304
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,734
And why do you have it?

305
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:45,038
It was a prize.

306
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,578
- Prize?
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:49,547
How old are you?

308
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:50,950
18.

309
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:52,686
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I am.

310
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:55,728
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

311
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,168
I'm arresting you.

312
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,008
Oh, couldn't resist, could ya?

313
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,047
Freddie.

314
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:07,718
I'll meet you at the
beach tomorrow, Otto.

315
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,893
And Zandar of Connecticut,
when I get back,

316
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:14,568
ice cream sundaes for days.

317
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:19,141
Otto, what are we gonna do?

318
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:20,677
Don't worry, we're gonna
be best friends in like

319
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:21,714
two minutes.

320
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:22,748
Shut up and get in.

321
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,153
See? He likes me already.

322
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:28,794
What are we gonna tell Nick?

323
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:30,030
You don't tell him anything.

324
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:31,937
I'll figure out what to say.

325
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,191
Wait a minute, really?

326
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:45,498
Really?

327
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:48,903
Bitch just pops a bunch
of fuckin' pills.

328
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:50,974
I gotta deal with the bullshit.

329
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:54,781
- Where the fuck do you live?
- Where the fuck do you live?

330
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,183
Where the fuck do I live?

331
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:57,988
Yes, really.

332
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,127
Well, you know what?
Fuck this.

333
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:03,164
If I can't be asking
fuckin' questions,

334
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,337
I see what's going on here.

335
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,932
This is
a collect call from...

336
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:20,935
Freddie.

337
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:22,038
I accept.

338
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,943
Freddie?

339
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:26,146
Hey, Mom.

340
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:27,881
You're three days late.

341
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:31,856
Sorry, I thought weekly
was more of a range.

342
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:33,027
Where are you?

343
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:34,863
California.

344
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:35,865
Where exactly?

345
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:37,205
Um...

346
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:41,309
I don't know.

347
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:42,712
How's Hugo?

348
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,881
Sleeping.
It's late.

349
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,284
Shit, I'm sorry.

350
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:46,987
I forgot the time difference.

351
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:49,259
You know, Courtney had
her sweet 16 last weekend.

352
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:51,329
Her mother called to see
if you wanted to come.

353
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:53,234
I told her you were
with your father.

354
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:55,907
Come on, you're lying.

355
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:57,176
Courtney's mom would never call.

356
00:19:57,178 --> 00:19:58,412
She hates me.

357
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:00,248
What the fuck is a sweet 16?

358
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,120
Is that like a fancy name
for a birthday party?

359
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:04,390
It's an important milestone.

360
00:20:04,392 --> 00:20:06,127
Why?

361
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:11,105
Is 15 like a year we
celebrate the surviving of?

362
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:13,309
- Freddie.
- Mother.

363
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:16,047
Could you just please
wake up Hugo, please?

364
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,350
No.

365
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:19,386
You want your family,
you come home.

366
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:21,291
Gosh, for the
millionth time, I told you,

367
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:22,495
I'm not coming home.

368
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:24,499
Why are you doing this to me?

369
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:26,936
Jesus Christ, Freddie, I'm
really worried about you.

370
00:20:26,938 --> 00:20:28,176
I miss you.

371
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:34,352
Stop worrying, okay?

372
00:20:34,354 --> 00:20:35,390
I'm fine.

373
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:39,331
Will you just tell
Hugo that I miss him?

374
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:42,369
I gotta go.

375
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:43,273
Bye.

376
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:46,981
Freddie.

377
00:20:48,283 --> 00:20:49,284
Freddie?

378
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:07,052
Stop.

379
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:08,992
Okay, stop.

380
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,333
Crying, okay.

381
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:15,972
Ooh. Okay.

382
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,045
Okay. Okay.

383
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:24,487
You're lying. There's no way
that she's with Dave.

384
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:26,225
That guy is a total scumbag.

385
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:27,928
She didn't go
because of him, man.

386
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,466
Dave's ridin' with Dready Jeff.

387
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:31,039
You know what kinda
player that cat is.

388
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:34,642
I still think
you're full of shit.

389
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:37,250
She said she'd meet us at
the beach tomorrow, relax.

390
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:45,666
What'd he do?

391
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:49,706
He, um...

392
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:52,314
Sorry, man.

393
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:55,986
Whatever.

394
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,392
Get Freddie's bag.

395
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:10,315
Let's go, debutante.

396
00:22:10,317 --> 00:22:13,287
Ooh, where we going, a ball?

397
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:14,693
I got your ball.

398
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,174
This amuses you?

399
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,480
No, but if you're
gonna make the effort.

400
00:22:25,482 --> 00:22:27,116
This is a mugshot.

401
00:22:27,118 --> 00:22:28,418
I know.

402
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,688
But my mom always says-

403
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,791
Nobody in here
gives a damn what your

404
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:32,394
white ass mama says.

405
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:34,031
Lost your doggone mind.

406
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:34,969
Turn.

407
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,814
Oh, yeah, who
let the wetbacks out?

408
00:22:41,816 --> 00:22:45,386
Hey!

409
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:48,161
Step it back, would you?

410
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:53,771
Oh, come on.

411
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:56,209
Why am I alone?

412
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:58,480
'Cause I know it
will annoy you more.

413
00:22:58,482 --> 00:23:00,151
Come on.

414
00:23:00,153 --> 00:23:01,822
What if you forget to feed me?

415
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:03,391
It happens at the
zoo all the time.

416
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:05,628
Oh, I wouldn't
worry about that.

417
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,735
Besides, you could afford
to lose a few pounds.

418
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:09,807
Damn.

419
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:15,515
Hey, listen, I just,

420
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:17,719
I was wondering,

421
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:20,125
are you guys taking bets on
who's gonna win over there?

422
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:23,166
Because I want in.

423
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,303
My money's on the chicas.

424
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:26,671
Why is that, cracker baby?

425
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,776
I don't know,
they work harder,

426
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:30,814
not always late.

427
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,619
You know what happens
if I put you in that cell?

428
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:37,394
Hmm, we toast marshmallows
and sing a multiracial

429
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:38,797
version of Kumbaya?

430
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,635
Child, you got your
little privileged ass

431
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:43,174
arrested in the wrong county
at the wrong time.

432
00:23:43,176 --> 00:23:45,510
Right, there is a good place
to get arrested.

433
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:46,579
I forgot.

434
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:47,781
You don't even know, do you?

435
00:23:47,783 --> 00:23:49,786
Why don't you tell me?

436
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:51,389
Ooh, it'll be like story time.

437
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:53,564
Hmm, I'm gonna do
better than tell you.

438
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:57,238
Oh, come on, don't leave now.

439
00:23:59,408 --> 00:24:00,310
Keep playin'.

440
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,336
Hey.

441
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:04,406
What are you doing?

442
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:06,945
Just trying to realign
all the blood in my body

443
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:08,680
so it floods to my brain

444
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:09,783
so I'm not so bored.

445
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:10,953
You?

446
00:25:10,955 --> 00:25:14,427
Releasing you, you're OR'd.

447
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,862
What does that mean?

448
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,700
Releasing you on
your own recognizance,

449
00:25:17,702 --> 00:25:19,738
but you have to come back for
your court date, of course.

450
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,876
Of course, yeah.

451
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:23,879
Why you smiling like that?

452
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:25,649
Happy for you is all.

453
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,886
Now get the hell outta here
before I change my mind.

454
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:29,558
Yes, ma'am.

455
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,593
You gotta take her back, man.

456
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,731
No, I will not take a gift back.

457
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,602
- Bad luck.
- Look, I'll leave her here.

458
00:25:34,604 --> 00:25:35,871
It'll be like I
never had her, right?

459
00:25:35,873 --> 00:25:37,441
How bout this,
I can help wake her up

460
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:38,710
and then
you can discuss it with her.

461
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:40,044
Okay?

462
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:43,118
Venice, bring
something for Chuchu.

463
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,823
It's all here?

464
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:46,057
Where the fuck did she
even come from anyway?

465
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:47,694
She was my brother's girl,

466
00:25:47,696 --> 00:25:49,031
but you don't have
to worry about that.

467
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,132
The fucker is in the
pen for shooting

468
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:51,469
some nigger's head off.

469
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:53,473
Oh, my God.

470
00:25:53,475 --> 00:25:55,510
Oh, my God, you fuckin'
psycho voodoo bastard.

471
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,047
You're tryin' to
fuckin' kill me!

472
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:58,551
It's like you fuckin'
sit there in your chair

473
00:25:58,553 --> 00:25:59,852
with your fuckin' cowboy hat on.

474
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:01,490
You look me in the
eyes and you say,

475
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:02,892
"I like you, Donny,"
'cause I remember it,

476
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,529
and then you send me
with a lifeless chick

477
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:06,165
and she's a fuckin'
fruit basket.

478
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,770
Donny.

479
00:26:07,772 --> 00:26:10,476
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut up.

480
00:26:10,478 --> 00:26:11,911
Why don't you both
shut the fuck up?

481
00:26:11,913 --> 00:26:13,882
Relax, my brother's the
least of your worries.

482
00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:15,786
He's as good as dead.

483
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:17,756
Least of my concerns?
Would you listen to yourself?

484
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:19,695
You're talkin' about your
own fuckin' brother here.

485
00:26:19,697 --> 00:26:21,798
No, no, no, no, absolutely not.

486
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,901
No fuckin' way.

487
00:26:22,903 --> 00:26:24,537
My brother was a no good thug.

488
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,073
We reap what we sow.

489
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:27,176
The fuck does that mean?

490
00:26:27,178 --> 00:26:28,178
Now like I deserve this?

491
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,179
What did I do?

492
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:30,181
Donny, come here.

493
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:31,618
No, no, no, no, no, no.

494
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,890
No, don't start this shit again.

495
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,592
Maybe this is a good thing.

496
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,931
When's the last time
you got laid?

497
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:38,967
Are you fuckin' serious?

498
00:26:38,969 --> 00:26:40,569
Yes.

499
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:41,906
Paolo, you gotta
help me, alright?

500
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:43,142
Oh, I did, she can walk now.

501
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,113
Come on, Venice, please?

502
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:49,255
Oh, fuck.

503
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:51,062
Why the fuck is this
happening to me?

504
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:53,263
Oh.

505
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:55,834
Have fun, eh?

506
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:56,739
Be gentle.

507
00:27:01,848 --> 00:27:03,183
Hey.

508
00:27:03,185 --> 00:27:04,586
Where's the white girl?

509
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:06,190
I let her out.

510
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,260
Neesy, she's 15
fuckin' years old.

511
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:09,629
What did you think you
were gonna do with her?

512
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:10,764
Send her home?

513
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:11,801
It's 11:00 at night.

514
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:13,170
That kid needed a lesson.

515
00:27:13,172 --> 00:27:15,674
Maybe but she
don't deserve to die.

516
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:16,946
That's not my problem.

517
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,655
You were at lunch.

518
00:27:41,364 --> 00:27:43,365
Hey, girl.

519
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:45,135
What you doin' out
past your bedtime?

520
00:27:45,137 --> 00:27:46,171
Me?

521
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:48,810
Yeah, you, baby.

522
00:27:48,812 --> 00:27:49,844
I lost my puppy.

523
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:51,180
I'll be your puppy, baby.

524
00:27:51,182 --> 00:27:52,250
You guys got a cigarette?

525
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:53,953
We got somethin' better.

526
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:57,395
Girl, we got the gold.

527
00:27:57,397 --> 00:28:00,367
Crack is so pretty,
don't ya think?

528
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:02,838
You know you want it, baby.

529
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,778
No, I want a cigarette.

530
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,782
What if I let you
have this one free?

531
00:28:07,784 --> 00:28:10,321
Then I'd say nothing
in life is free.

532
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:11,857
But I don't know, maybe
we can make a deal.

533
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,262
How much change you both
got in your pockets?

534
00:28:16,235 --> 00:28:17,706
Come on, playas, play with me.

535
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:22,980
Okay, if I smoke your freebie,

536
00:28:22,982 --> 00:28:24,317
you give me all your change.

537
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,956
- What do we get?
- Think about it.

538
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:27,288
Why's the first one always free?

539
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,291
It's the hook.

540
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:30,797
Yep, so,

541
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,033
if I smoke one hit and I
don't want another one,

542
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:34,035
you pay me.

543
00:28:34,037 --> 00:28:35,205
Otherwise, I'm hooked.

544
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:36,110
Alright, sugarplum.

545
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:41,117
So, where you from, Ma?

546
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,955
I'm a child star.

547
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:45,259
My parents went crazy
and blew all my money.

548
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:46,295
No way.

549
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:47,430
Who are you?

550
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:48,499
Bro, I'm just playing.

551
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:50,435
I'm not a child star.

552
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,742
Ready?

553
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:02,328
Like it, baby?

554
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,897
What the fuck did
we tell you about

555
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:05,834
peddling your shit on
this side of town, huh?

556
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:07,307
Hey yo, let go of
my brother, beaner!

557
00:29:08,474 --> 00:29:09,976
Fuck you call me?

558
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:11,612
Shit, he just
called you a beaner!

559
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:13,517
- Shut up, crack whore.
- Excuse me, sir.

560
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,953
I am not a crack whore.

561
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:16,057
Yeah, I just smoked
a hit of crack,

562
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:17,059
but that doesn't...

563
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:18,994
Bitch, shut the fuck up.

564
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:20,931
Okay.

565
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,369
That's fucking smart.

566
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:23,904
Yeah, I'm leaving.

567
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:25,474
Oh, fuck, oh, shit.

568
00:29:25,476 --> 00:29:27,145
What we got going on
over here, huh?

569
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:28,648
Oh, shit!

570
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,287
Look like it's our side
of the town now, son.

571
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:33,992
I wanna shoot your
motherfuckin' ass right now,

572
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:36,030
you fuckin' roach.

573
00:29:36,032 --> 00:29:37,466
I been itchin' to shoot me a
motherfuckin' cholo tonight.

574
00:29:37,468 --> 00:29:39,638
Yeah, look, bap, bap, bap!

575
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:44,915
What are you doing?

576
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,018
Get outta here.

577
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,121
But, Antoine, this my spot.

578
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:49,624
Okay, I'm stuttering
around here.

579
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:51,930
I'm not gettin' my point across?

580
00:29:51,932 --> 00:29:54,402
Get the fuck outta here.

581
00:29:54,404 --> 00:29:56,304
You think this
is a fuckin' game?

582
00:29:56,306 --> 00:29:58,677
Get the fuck outta here.

583
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,316
Back to this motherfuckin'
burrito eatin'

584
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:02,652
motherfucker right here.

585
00:30:02,654 --> 00:30:04,157
Oh, so you nervous, huh?

586
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:11,134
Oh, my God.
What was that?

587
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:14,274
Takin' our territory
back from the Mexo.

588
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,114
Is that wise?

589
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:19,419
Hell yeah, it's our spot now.

590
00:30:19,421 --> 00:30:21,590
Wouldn't it just be more
reasonable to, ya know,

591
00:30:21,592 --> 00:30:23,695
pick a spot they don't want?

592
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,598
Oh, yeah he, oh, that's
the bitch right there.

593
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,168
No, no, no, that's the
bigger bitch right here.

594
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,072
Put it right here.
Right here.

595
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:30,375
My boy over there, Antoine,

596
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:32,078
it was one of his
boys that got shot.

597
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,749
Now we fixin' to kill
all them roaches.

598
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:35,352
If I had my gun,
they would be shot.

599
00:30:35,354 --> 00:30:37,123
Two Mexicans shot right now,

600
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,359
cholo on the ground
bleedin' right now.

601
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:41,297
The biggest problem is,
nigga who shot 'em all's

602
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,701
threatening the pen
and shit, cock out.

603
00:30:43,703 --> 00:30:45,706
But it'll be over soon.

604
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:47,643
I heard that nigga just got
moved back to general pop.

605
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,149
Nah, I heard he's
buying himself protection.

606
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:54,624
I'm done.
Deal's a deal, man.

607
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:56,162
Nah, nah, no way.

608
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:57,431
Nobody likes a punk.

609
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,669
Jesus.

610
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:01,839
Fine.

611
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:05,516
Come on.

612
00:31:06,651 --> 00:31:07,787
Thank you.

613
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:11,826
Hey, white girl.

614
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,697
You pretty cool.

615
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:16,802
How 'bout I let you
come home and do me?

616
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:18,540
Enticing,

617
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:22,583
but I've got plans, sorry.

618
00:31:22,585 --> 00:31:24,286
Pshhh.

619
00:31:37,716 --> 00:31:39,884
Yeah, Donny, come on!

620
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:42,923
Oh, you're such a good boy,
Donny. You're such a good boy.

621
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:50,806
Oh, my God.

622
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,345
No more.

623
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:58,456
Holy fuck, holy shit.

624
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,760
No, no, no.

625
00:32:00,762 --> 00:32:01,799
You gotta stop right now.

626
00:32:11,851 --> 00:32:13,386
Good boy.

627
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:22,003
Alright, see ya.

628
00:32:22,005 --> 00:32:24,643
So, guy is sick

629
00:32:24,645 --> 00:32:26,748
and Rod wants us to come out
there tomorrow afternoon.

630
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,451
Shit, alright.

631
00:32:28,453 --> 00:32:29,519
I'm gonna go see if
Freddie's here yet.

632
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:30,955
She's not gonna be.

633
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:32,458
They mentioned
stopping in Venice.

634
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,929
You should just
fuckin' chill, man.

635
00:32:33,931 --> 00:32:35,632
That's alright, I'm
a little amped anyways.

636
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:37,035
That shit gets into your system

637
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:38,671
no matter how careful you are.

638
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:40,843
Ooh, can I get some of
that shit in my system?

639
00:32:40,845 --> 00:32:42,779
- Yes, you may, baby.
- Ooh.

640
00:32:42,781 --> 00:32:43,915
Hey, hey.

641
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,886
Don't eat it all, okay?

642
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:47,359
Okay, alright.

643
00:32:59,483 --> 00:33:00,883
Pack of cigarettes, please.

644
00:33:00,885 --> 00:33:02,019
$1.65.

645
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,590
How's 1.55 sound?

646
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:07,030
Like you're short 10 cents.

647
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:08,533
But it's only 10 cents.

648
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:10,336
- Don't care.
- Come on, man.

649
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:11,738
Want me to recite
state capitals?

650
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,477
I want you to
have 10 more cents.

651
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:16,949
Okay look, kind
gas attendant man.

652
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,986
I have had a very long day.

653
00:33:18,988 --> 00:33:21,360
I was locked up for four hours

654
00:33:21,362 --> 00:33:23,830
in a racial wrestling ring
and I was just

655
00:33:23,832 --> 00:33:27,537
forced to smoke crack
in order to obtain

656
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:31,681
this perfect amount of
change that you are calling

657
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:33,417
10 cents short.

658
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:34,720
'Cause it is.

659
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,089
Oh, my God.

660
00:33:36,091 --> 00:33:37,825
This is what
we're gonna do, okay?

661
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:39,633
I'm go...

662
00:33:41,068 --> 00:33:42,703
Thanks, man.

663
00:33:42,705 --> 00:33:44,643
- Have a great day.
- Mm-hmm.

664
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,823
Hey, you guys have a light?

665
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:54,696
No smoking.

666
00:33:57,134 --> 00:33:58,101
Come on, please.

667
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,938
No, child, no smoking.

668
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,909
You ain't gon' blow us up
out here tonight, uh-uh.

669
00:34:01,911 --> 00:34:03,078
Fine.

670
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,214
Do you know how long it'd take

671
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:05,750
to walk to San Diego from here?

672
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,788
Child, I'm from LA.

673
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,525
I ain't walked nowhere
since I was 10 years old.

674
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:12,130
Shit, I gotta get there.

675
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:13,131
Suggestions?

676
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:15,135
Girl, use them thumbs.

677
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,807
Or that pretty little mouth.

678
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:20,147
Suck a dick
all the way to Mexico.

679
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:23,721
Do you guys have pimps

680
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:25,624
or a pimp?

681
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:27,895
Why you ask?

682
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:29,134
Bored fascination.

683
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:32,874
I'll tell ya for two smokes.

684
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:34,112
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

685
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:36,783
Okay.

686
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:43,294
He dead.

687
00:34:43,296 --> 00:34:45,631
Mm-hmm, I killed
that motherfucker.

688
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:47,535
You're lyin', really?

689
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:52,045
You's a dumbass white girl.

690
00:34:52,047 --> 00:34:54,817
She just being mean.
It's true though.

691
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:57,756
I killed him. He was interfering
with my money makin'.

692
00:34:57,758 --> 00:35:00,795
That seems kinda
counterintuitive for a pimp.

693
00:35:00,797 --> 00:35:02,299
Yeah, he was hatin'
on our cholo niggas,

694
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:03,869
so he had to go.

695
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:05,774
Now let me give you
a tip, little girl.

696
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:08,346
Ain't nobody out here this late

697
00:35:08,348 --> 00:35:13,255
except for murderers,
hustlers, hookers,

698
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:14,992
and you.

699
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:16,595
So watch your back.

700
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:17,797
That's a pretty weak tip.

701
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:18,999
Yeah, well, here's one.

702
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:21,873
Start learning how to suck dick.

703
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:25,012
You'll be fine.
Just stay away from them gangs.

704
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:27,752
'Cause spics be
killin' niggas.

705
00:35:27,754 --> 00:35:29,221
Niggas be killin' spics.

706
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:31,660
And as long as you
ain't one of them,

707
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,795
you be alright.

708
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,198
What about you guys?

709
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,102
Ain't nobody kills
good pussy, honey.

710
00:35:36,104 --> 00:35:40,211
Yeah, baby.
Nobody kills good pussy, baby.

711
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,789
Here, take it.

712
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:47,860
There, did my good deed
for the day.

713
00:35:47,862 --> 00:35:49,663
Bye, ladies.

714
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:30,882
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker!

715
00:36:33,488 --> 00:36:34,923
Niggers!

716
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:41,069
Fucking cunt.

717
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:45,111
Chuchu. Fuckin' kill her.

718
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:46,813
Motherfucker, you!

719
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:50,053
This is all her fault, Venice!

720
00:36:50,055 --> 00:36:52,024
No, Paolo, it's Lobo's fault.
It's your brother's fault.

721
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:53,427
Yeah, exactly, why
isn't he dead yet?

722
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:55,297
How should I know?

723
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:57,369
You fuckin' bitch, I'm
gonna fuckin' shoot you.

724
00:36:59,442 --> 00:37:01,277
Fuck, shit.

725
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:03,047
Alright, I'm gonna take off.

726
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:04,950
If you wanna go, you
gotta take Chuchu with you.

727
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:07,055
No, no, no, no.
I really don't think I can.

728
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:08,925
You don't wanna take her,
no problem. I'll kill her.

729
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:12,533
Alright, alright,
I'll take her, alright?

730
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:14,604
You know, when I'm done
with all this shit,

731
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:16,441
I'm gonna get a job
at a fuckin' carwash.

732
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,179
Nine to five, that's
what I'm gonna do.

733
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:21,352
No, you take Chuchu, you
get the rest of the money,

734
00:37:21,354 --> 00:37:22,855
you don't get robbed,
you don't get kidnapped,

735
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:24,057
you don't get killed

736
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:25,626
and this'll all be over soon.

737
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:27,062
Alright, and I definitely
have to take her?

738
00:37:27,064 --> 00:37:28,266
Yes!

739
00:37:28,268 --> 00:37:31,272
Oh, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

740
00:37:46,271 --> 00:37:48,210
You gonna ask me
if I want ice cream?

741
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:55,922
Why are you giving me money?

742
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:59,031
I like to take care of
the kids on the street.

743
00:38:06,345 --> 00:38:08,016
You have a nice one, mister.

744
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,016
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

745
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,484
So you didn't get shot,

746
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,689
that's really great
for, ya know, you.

747
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:47,094
But I assume not for the
other guys, you know?

748
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:48,330
Oh, let me see, let me see.

749
00:38:48,332 --> 00:38:49,632
Oh, it's okay.

750
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:55,377
That's 100% white girl
right there.

751
00:38:55,379 --> 00:38:56,814
Yeah.

752
00:38:56,816 --> 00:38:58,251
On point.

753
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:03,628
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

754
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,798
Helen Keller.

755
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,735
Helen Keller, right?

756
00:39:06,737 --> 00:39:08,771
Yes, perfect, you are perfect.

757
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:12,647
No, I'm pretty sure I
can see, hear and talk.

758
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:13,649
No, no, no, no,
no, I get that.

759
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,118
I get that, see,

760
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,490
we got a game that
we like to play.

761
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:18,658
Right?

762
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,797
See, I'm gonna fuck you

763
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:22,133
until you go blind.

764
00:39:22,135 --> 00:39:23,702
Then my man Beef here,

765
00:39:23,704 --> 00:39:26,676
he gonna fuck you
until you go deaf.

766
00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:29,113
Then I'm gonna come back around

767
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:32,119
and I'm gonna fuck you
until you go mute.

768
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:32,824
You see?

769
00:39:35,161 --> 00:39:36,363
Okay.

770
00:39:36,365 --> 00:39:38,233
That's seriously mortifying.

771
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:40,337
Super clever though,
that's real clever.

772
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:43,309
See we got a little
mouthy little smartass,

773
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:45,448
little...
oh, shit!

774
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,184
Yeah, I like her mouth.
I like her mouth.

775
00:39:47,186 --> 00:39:48,621
No, guys, that
was a compliment.

776
00:39:48,623 --> 00:39:50,491
Total compliment.

777
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:52,729
Isn't there a war
you should be tending to?

778
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:54,165
Bitch, don't be
talkin' to me about

779
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:55,569
what I should be doin'!

780
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:57,673
I should be fuckin'
you right now.

781
00:39:57,675 --> 00:40:00,410
Truce, man?
You want my cigarettes?

782
00:40:00,412 --> 00:40:02,247
No, I don't want no
fuckin' cigarettes.

783
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:05,321
Oh, ain't nobody
to save your ass.

784
00:40:05,323 --> 00:40:06,590
Man, who the fuck?

785
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:08,595
Dad, oh, my God, it's my Dad!

786
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:10,398
Dad, oh, hey.

787
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,902
Shit, one second.

788
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:14,472
You know, guys, this
has been real great.

789
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:17,245
Ya know, he's a cop,
I was just rebelling.

790
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:18,447
You've seen it a million times.

791
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,650
Hey, you know what though?

792
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:21,454
You guys have a
really sick ride.

793
00:40:21,456 --> 00:40:23,692
Next time we hang out, I
wanna ride in it, you know?

794
00:40:23,694 --> 00:40:25,262
I got something
for you to ride on!

795
00:40:25,264 --> 00:40:26,732
Bye guys!

796
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:29,706
Helen! Helen!

797
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,776
Ooh.

798
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:35,350
So, where you going?

799
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:37,520
San Diego.

800
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:39,323
That ain't her
daddy, nigga, that's a trick.

801
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:40,828
She 'bout to suck
his dick right now.

802
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,829
Come on, man.

803
00:40:41,831 --> 00:40:43,833
That was my white girl, man.

804
00:40:43,835 --> 00:40:45,004
Are you okay?

805
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:46,441
Yeah, I'm fine.

806
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:52,317
Just don't think you're gonna
get anything from me, okay?

807
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,355
I don't.

808
00:40:54,357 --> 00:40:57,495
Well, excuse me if
I find that unlikely.

809
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,700
I mean, I don't fault
you for it, it's just,

810
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:02,942
you're not gonna get it
from me, deal?

811
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,620
I hate clowns.

812
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:11,757
What?

813
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:15,499
They don't scare me,
I just don't like them.

814
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:18,003
I set one on fire at my
friend's birthday party once.

815
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:19,609
Why would you do that?

816
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,583
Are you a serial killer?

817
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:27,557
No, I'm a father.

818
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:30,630
And John Wayne Gacy
was a fucking clown.

819
00:41:30,632 --> 00:41:34,871
That doesn't mean he
didn't kill little boys.

820
00:41:34,873 --> 00:41:37,910
I'm not a killer.

821
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,048
Just listen, if
you are a murderer,

822
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,153
that's your business entirely.

823
00:41:42,155 --> 00:41:44,759
Just please don't
murder me, okay?

824
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:48,768
I'm way too fuckin' tired
to die right now.

825
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,939
I promise.

826
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:18,115
Uh...

827
00:43:18,117 --> 00:43:21,058
This is far as I can take you.

828
00:43:22,963 --> 00:43:25,297
Thanks for not killing me.

829
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:27,004
Um, uh...

830
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,290
Z?

831
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:55,761
Dude.

832
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:56,967
I can see you.

833
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,451
I'm a Cherokee!

834
00:44:07,453 --> 00:44:09,125
Fuck! Go around!

835
00:44:24,053 --> 00:44:25,355
Chill the fuck out, Z.

836
00:44:25,357 --> 00:44:27,927
Dude, I need you to cool off.

837
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:34,806
Z, Z, it's Nick, okay?

838
00:44:34,808 --> 00:44:37,912
Please, please shut the fuck up.

839
00:44:37,914 --> 00:44:39,250
You can't have me, man.

840
00:44:39,252 --> 00:44:41,088
You can't have me.

841
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,257
I'm like free.

842
00:44:42,259 --> 00:44:43,959
I'm like a free man.

843
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:44,996
We don't want you.

844
00:44:44,998 --> 00:44:47,134
We need you to shut the fuck up.

845
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:26,248
Hey, that's pretty good.

846
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:30,957
Hey, Herman, look at this.

847
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:32,162
What?

848
00:45:41,981 --> 00:45:43,948
Cute.

849
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,452
That
means he likes it.

850
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:47,558
Right.

851
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,027
And who are you?

852
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:50,029
The ghost of Christmas past?

853
00:45:53,404 --> 00:45:55,640
Herman.
I'm just a drunk.

854
00:45:55,642 --> 00:45:58,915
He's not just a drunk.
Tell her.

855
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:03,089
I write a little, that's all.

856
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:04,126
Really?

857
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,333
I'm Freddie, nice to meet you.

858
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:10,603
I'm a runaway

859
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:13,612
and according to two
gang members, a smartass.

860
00:46:15,715 --> 00:46:18,186
Runaway, huh?

861
00:46:18,188 --> 00:46:20,157
Someone beat you?

862
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,728
No.

863
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,533
Touch you?

864
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:26,303
Nope.

865
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:27,973
Orphan?

866
00:46:27,975 --> 00:46:28,978
No, sir.

867
00:46:31,614 --> 00:46:34,654
One who runs away often does so

868
00:46:34,656 --> 00:46:36,390
to get away from something.

869
00:46:36,392 --> 00:46:38,562
Yes, often.

870
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:40,698
But not always.

871
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,709
Do you know what
impetuous means?

872
00:46:45,711 --> 00:46:47,646
No.

873
00:46:47,648 --> 00:46:50,720
It means a person
who acts in a rash

874
00:46:50,722 --> 00:46:53,057
and inconsiderate manner,

875
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:55,462
often the mark of
the very young.

876
00:46:55,464 --> 00:46:58,068
I think you just insulted me

877
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:02,142
with a thesaurus.

878
00:47:02,144 --> 00:47:06,184
Well, as much as I
love to be analyzed.

879
00:47:06,186 --> 00:47:07,089
Please.

880
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,230
Please stay.

881
00:47:12,132 --> 00:47:15,670
Keep an old man company while he

882
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:19,110
eats one of his last meals.

883
00:47:19,112 --> 00:47:20,614
Fine.

884
00:47:20,616 --> 00:47:21,751
But it's your turn now.

885
00:47:21,753 --> 00:47:23,654
What?

886
00:47:23,656 --> 00:47:25,725
What's your mark

887
00:47:25,727 --> 00:47:30,469
of the, ya know,
very, very, very old?

888
00:47:30,471 --> 00:47:32,574
And make it good or
this dance is over.

889
00:47:36,248 --> 00:47:40,856
The mark of the very old is
always the same, young lady.

890
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:47,573
Reflection hampered by
immeasurable regret.

891
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:52,114
What's your biggest regret?

892
00:48:00,698 --> 00:48:03,434
That it took me
until now to realize

893
00:48:03,436 --> 00:48:06,308
what I could've
learned at your age

894
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,849
if I wasn't such an impetuous,
horrid little know-it-all.

895
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:13,557
Wow, you

896
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:17,498
just might be the worst
new friend maker on the planet.

897
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,340
Don't confuse
tactics with character.

898
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:38,708
There's only

899
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,248
one thing for people like us.

900
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,253
If you say it's sweet 16's,
we're done for.

901
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,891
Ambition.

902
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:51,400
But once you know, you
have to live up to it

903
00:48:51,402 --> 00:48:53,338
or else.

904
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,875
Or else?

905
00:48:55,877 --> 00:48:58,518
Liver spots and
immeasurable regret?

906
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:03,862
Why run when there's
nothing to run from?

907
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,868
I'm not running.

908
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,775
Those were your
words, not mine.

909
00:49:13,382 --> 00:49:14,819
It's just an expression.

910
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:18,592
Sure it is.

911
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:32,084
It was nice to
meet you, Herman.

912
00:49:32,086 --> 00:49:33,455
Keep it.

913
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,914
What's up, two socks?

914
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:12,189
Hey.

915
00:51:12,191 --> 00:51:13,927
Said you were gonna
stop using rigs.

916
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:15,065
It's better this way.

917
00:51:18,738 --> 00:51:21,642
Whatever, man, see ya outside.

918
00:51:21,644 --> 00:51:24,982
What the fuck man, what? What?

919
00:51:24,984 --> 00:51:27,087
I think we're being followed.

920
00:51:27,089 --> 00:51:28,823
What am I looking at?

921
00:51:28,825 --> 00:51:30,727
Look, those two Mexican dudes
down there in that car.

922
00:51:30,729 --> 00:51:33,198
What the fuck are you...
stop being paranoid, man.

923
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,671
No, look, it rings a bell.

924
00:51:35,673 --> 00:51:37,610
What?

925
00:51:37,612 --> 00:51:40,014
Z, you're being paranoid,
chill the fuck out.

926
00:51:40,016 --> 00:51:42,720
Dude, it's just a blue car.

927
00:51:42,722 --> 00:51:45,291
No, the two Mexican dudes
sat in it all night.

928
00:51:45,293 --> 00:51:47,128
I am paranoid, but I'm
not wrong about this.

929
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:49,667
Look, I remember them.

930
00:51:50,703 --> 00:51:52,104
Oh, motherfucker!

931
00:51:52,106 --> 00:51:54,710
Shit. Z, help me, man.

932
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:57,816
What'd I just fucking
say about the needles?

933
00:51:57,818 --> 00:51:59,085
Yeah, Freddie
wouldn't be in jail

934
00:51:59,087 --> 00:52:00,757
if you weren't shooting!

935
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,867
- What? Z?
- Oops.

936
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:07,871
Freddie got popped from that
rig she snatched from Otto.

937
00:52:07,873 --> 00:52:09,107
You fucking dick.

938
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:10,175
What happened?

939
00:52:10,177 --> 00:52:11,845
You OD'd, asshole.

940
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:13,716
Go get ice.

941
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:53,463
- Whoa.
- Sorry!

942
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:55,134
Yeah, no.

943
00:52:55,136 --> 00:52:57,005
Hey, I know you.

944
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,377
Uh, no, I don't think so.

945
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:01,112
No, no, no, I
definitely know you.

946
00:53:01,114 --> 00:53:03,919
You're friends with
Dready Jeff, right?

947
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:05,054
Yeah, kinda.

948
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,827
Yeah, what are you doin' here?

949
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:10,230
Um, I'm headed to San Diego.

950
00:53:10,232 --> 00:53:11,802
I got arrested yesterday

951
00:53:11,804 --> 00:53:15,042
and I managed to make it
this far without dying.

952
00:53:15,044 --> 00:53:17,947
Oh, shit.
You wanna sit down?

953
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:19,819
You wanna have a cup
of coffee or something?

954
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,922
- Yeah, thank you.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

955
00:53:21,924 --> 00:53:24,227
Can you get my friend
a cup of coffee please?

956
00:53:24,229 --> 00:53:25,262
Do you want anything else?

957
00:53:25,264 --> 00:53:26,263
You want something to eat?

958
00:53:26,265 --> 00:53:27,834
Food or something?

959
00:53:27,836 --> 00:53:30,373
Yeah, can I get a
cheese Danish please?

960
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,009
And a jelly donut

961
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:35,085
and no, that's it.

962
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:38,022
Do you mind?

963
00:53:38,024 --> 00:53:40,292
Oh no, go ahead.

964
00:53:40,294 --> 00:53:43,498
So ya know, I
live in San Diego.

965
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,371
I could give you a ride
if you want.

966
00:53:45,373 --> 00:53:46,974
Seriously?

967
00:53:46,976 --> 00:53:49,145
Yeah, ya know, I need
the company anyway.

968
00:53:49,147 --> 00:53:50,514
That would
actually be amazing.

969
00:53:50,516 --> 00:53:51,582
Great.

970
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:53,954
Not to be rude or anything but,

971
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:57,227
you kinda look like
you could use a bath.

972
00:53:57,229 --> 00:53:58,630
Nah, that's just my style.

973
00:53:58,632 --> 00:54:00,304
Your style.

974
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:03,642
So, what's in San Diego?

975
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:05,646
A modeling job.

976
00:54:05,648 --> 00:54:08,083
Modeling?

977
00:54:08,085 --> 00:54:09,452
You serious?

978
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,490
No.

979
00:54:11,492 --> 00:54:14,095
Well, you know, you could.

980
00:54:14,097 --> 00:54:15,699
You ever tried?

981
00:54:15,701 --> 00:54:19,240
Yes, actually, I modeled
for a mugshot earlier.

982
00:54:19,242 --> 00:54:21,946
I looked awesome too.

983
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:23,315
Cute, man.

984
00:54:23,317 --> 00:54:25,219
Great, that's what

Well ya know,

986
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,626
about the modeling thing.

987
00:54:28,628 --> 00:54:30,429
I could help you get cleaned up.

988
00:54:30,431 --> 00:54:32,368
Come on, man.

989
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,373
I kinda need a break from people
fucking with me right now.

990
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:37,678
Well, I'm not fucking with you.

991
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,716
Seriously, my girl's a stylist.
She's really cool.

992
00:54:39,718 --> 00:54:42,188
I think you'd really
like her and, ya know,

993
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:45,693

look like fuckin' shit.

994
00:54:45,695 --> 00:54:47,667
Okay, thank you.

995
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:50,174
Um...

996
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:53,544
Whatever, fine, make me over.

997
00:54:53,546 --> 00:54:57,151
Just, um, I need to
get to San Diego.

998
00:54:57,153 --> 00:54:59,592
Well, San Diego it is.

999
00:55:00,794 --> 00:55:01,697
Wanna go?

1000
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:05,371
Yeah, okay.

1001
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,614
Is that your car?

1002
00:55:11,616 --> 00:55:12,518
Yep.

1003
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:17,192
Can I drive?

1004
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:18,795
No.

1005
00:55:18,797 --> 00:55:22,570
Oh, come on, man, really?

1006
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:23,675
Come on!

1007
00:55:32,827 --> 00:55:34,327
- Donny!
- No, no, Chuchu, go.

1008
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:35,730
Go back upstairs.

1009
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:38,102
I got business, you go
back to bed, alright?

1010
00:55:38,104 --> 00:55:39,471
Yo, what'd you just call her?

1011
00:55:39,473 --> 00:55:41,109
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, what?

1012
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:42,443
What the fuck did
you just call her?

1013
00:55:42,445 --> 00:55:43,780
- Fuck you!
- She didn't mean that.

1014
00:55:43,782 --> 00:55:45,116
What the fuck is
this cunt's name, bro?

1015
00:55:45,118 --> 00:55:46,319
Chuchu or something like that.

1016
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:47,553
That could
totally be a fake name.

1017
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:49,859
It sounds like a
fake name, right?

1018
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:51,461
You got something
you wanna say to me?

1019
00:55:52,601 --> 00:55:53,735
Excuse me, bitch?

1020
00:55:53,737 --> 00:55:54,736
Can I get my keys?

1021
00:55:54,738 --> 00:55:56,706
Donny, fuck off!

1022
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,743
And you, you piece of shit,

1023
00:55:58,745 --> 00:56:01,315
ugly, impotent fucking monkey.

1024
00:56:02,553 --> 00:56:04,421
- Keep talking.
- Ooh.

1025
00:56:04,423 --> 00:56:07,261
- No, no, bro, don't kill her.
- Shut the fuck up.

1026
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:09,566
I'm gonna go sit in the car.

1027
00:56:09,568 --> 00:56:11,204
Go sit in the car.

1028
00:56:11,206 --> 00:56:12,805
That was you, wasn't it?

1029
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:14,843
And your little shit fuck
boyfriend killed my friend.

1030
00:56:14,845 --> 00:56:17,216
Get your fuckin' hands
off of me.

1031
00:56:17,218 --> 00:56:19,287
I didn't do nothin'.
Lobo shot him, wasn't me.

1032
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:21,223
Well, Lobo's fuckin'
dead now, isn't he?

1033
00:56:21,225 --> 00:56:22,862
Lobo's not dead.

1034
00:56:24,934 --> 00:56:26,635
You wanna hear a secret?

1035
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:29,544
Teeny tiny little secret, hmm?

1036
00:56:32,915 --> 00:56:34,817
You want Lobo dead?

1037
00:56:34,819 --> 00:56:37,891
Get the money before he does.

1038
00:56:37,893 --> 00:56:40,297
Mission Beach,

How's that supposed to keep me

1043
00:56:47,413 --> 00:56:48,946
from killing you now though?

1044
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:52,287
It's not so I don't die, darky.

1045
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:53,792
So you do.

1046
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:12,833
You're running outta time.

1047

What's up, man?
I'm takin' a shit, man.

1048

1061
00:57:58,124 --> 00:57:59,593
I'll get you some sugar.

00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,480

00:58:58,848 --> 00:59:01,150
Oh, there's water in there.

1067
00:59:01,152 --> 00:59:02,855
Beer's gross.

1068

Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

Sick, how much money is that?

1075
00:59:20,694 --> 00:59:22,629
I've never seen that
much money before.

1076
00:59:22,631 --> 00:59:24,734
Just about 300k.

1077
00:59:24,736 --> 00:59:26,704
- Damn, Richie Rich.
- Yeah, well, it's not mine.

1078
00:59:26,706 --> 00:59:30,979

00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:36,959

Yeah, well, try to enjoy it.

1083
00:59:40,301 --> 00:59:41,903
Be a big girl.

1084
00:59:41,905 --> 00:59:43,976
Let's get outta here.

1085
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:56,199

- Z, trust me, it'll work, okay?

1086
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:59,842
Otto, get fuckin' dressed,

1087
01:00:05,753 --> 01:00:06,654

01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:40,234

You just, you scared me.

01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,585
Well, shut up!

1103
01:02:48,587 --> 01:02:50,357
No, you shut up

1104
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:51,659
and get down.

1105
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:53,429

1106
01:02:53,431 --> 01:02:56,468
Come on, no, no, no,

Good, stay.

1109
01:03:00,612 --> 01:03:01,678
Now what are you waiting for?

1110
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,582

He is really fuckin' strong.

1115
01:03:23,827 --> 01:03:26,396
You broke my glass, huh?

1116
01:03:26,398 --> 01:03:28,570
I paid.
Give her back.

1117
01:03:31,643 --> 01:03:32,843
What?

1118
01:03:32,845 --> 01:03:35,081
What do you want me to do?

1119
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:37,118
What do I want you to do?
Are you fuckin' serious?

1120
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,290
He say he pay.

1121
01:03:39,292 --> 01:03:42,831
You paid how much?

1122
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:44,102
$200.

1123
01:03:45,872 --> 01:03:47,773
Oh, my God.

1124
01:03:47,775 --> 01:03:51,614
Wow, I just got sold for $200

1125
01:03:51,616 --> 01:03:54,754
and you, you ugly motherfucker,

01:03:54,756 --> 01:03:57,427
just got robbed.

1127
01:03:57,429 --> 01:03:59,598
You, no professional.

1128
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,201
No shit, I'm not professional.

1129
01:04:01,203 --> 01:04:03,772
I'm 15 fucking years old!

1130
01:04:03,774 --> 01:04:06,277
Now if either of you
prefer not to go to jail

1131
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:09,252
for statutory, I suggest
you get my fuckin' clothes!

1132
01:04:09,254 --> 01:04:10,820
I'll get you someone else.

1133
01:04:10,822 --> 01:04:13,562
God damn it!

1134
01:04:16,735 --> 01:04:19,704
Now get the fuck out of here.

1135
01:04:19,706 --> 01:04:22,477
Can I get dressed
first, asshole?

1136
01:04:22,479 --> 01:04:23,914
You know what, no, actually,

1137
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:26,453
I think I'm gonna stick around.

1138
01:04:26,455 --> 01:04:27,622
Give me 50 bucks.

1139
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,429
Are you outta your mind?

1140
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:32,966
Maybe, but ya know what,

1141
01:04:32,968 --> 01:04:37,308
you got a naked, bruised
and bloodied minor

1142
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:40,582
standing in the parking lot
of your shitty ass

1143
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:41,885
whore hotel.

1144
01:04:41,887 --> 01:04:45,592
So, if you don't
give me 50 bucks,

1145
01:04:45,594 --> 01:04:47,429
I'm just gonna sit here and
start a game of hopscotch,

1146
01:04:47,431 --> 01:04:48,532
maybe knock on the

1147
01:04:48,534 --> 01:04:49,933
see if they wanna play.

1148
01:04:49,935 --> 01:04:51,339
Does that sound fun?

1149
01:04:52,741 --> 01:04:53,742
Here's five.

1150
01:04:53,744 --> 01:04:55,945
Here's 20.

1151
01:04:55,947 --> 01:04:59,455
There, now get the fuck
outta my property!

1152
01:04:59,457 --> 01:05:00,556
Fuck you, man!

1153
01:05:00,558 --> 01:05:02,663
Go fuck yourself
and your mother!

1154
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,752
I just got sold.

1155
01:05:36,464 --> 01:05:38,600
Hey, man, how's it goin'? Good?

1156
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:39,703
Yeah, I'm alright.

1157
01:05:39,705 --> 01:05:41,844
I'm alright, I'm chill.

1158
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:47,085
Got the money, Nick?

1159
01:05:47,087 --> 01:05:49,089
No, not yet.

1160
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:50,825
Not yet, why?

1161
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:52,095
Nick, you said to me,
"Donny, be here tomorrow.

1162
01:05:52,097 --> 01:05:53,098
I'll have the rest
of your money."

1163
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,099
I'm here, Nick.

1164
01:05:54,101 --> 01:05:55,401
Where's the money?

1165
01:05:55,403 --> 01:05:56,404
I'll have it.

1166
01:05:56,406 --> 01:05:57,405
I just have to go up to El Tay.

1167
01:05:57,407 --> 01:05:58,808
El Tay?

1168
01:05:58,810 --> 01:05:59,809
What kinda trust fund surfer
lives in the

1169
01:05:59,811 --> 01:06:01,915
fucking canyon, man?

1170
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,017
I didn't want
you freaking out.

1171
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:04,423
Don't want me freaking out?

1172
01:06:06,627 --> 01:06:08,395
What, Rod?

1173
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:10,098
Rod, no.

1174
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,136
No fuckin' way, you know
how I feel about him, right?

1175
01:06:12,138 --> 01:06:13,539
Rod, no.
No fuckin' way.

1176
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:14,874
Hey, he has a kid now.

1177
01:06:14,876 --> 01:06:15,909
- It's different.
- Oh, great.

1178
01:06:15,911 --> 01:06:17,680
Or he bought the kid.

1179
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,049
Trust me.

1180
01:06:19,051 --> 01:06:21,053
Besides, we got bigger problems.

1181
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,624
You seen two Mexican
dudes in a blue

1182
01:06:22,626 --> 01:06:24,762
- Thunderbird following you?
- No, why?

1183
01:06:24,764 --> 01:06:26,666
Because I think there
was two Mexican dudes

1184
01:06:26,668 --> 01:06:28,169
in a blue Thunderbird
following you

1185
01:06:28,171 --> 01:06:29,872
- and now they're following us.
- Fuck!

1186
01:06:29,874 --> 01:06:32,479
Hey, hey, we took
care of it but,

1187
01:06:32,481 --> 01:06:33,880
you know where they might be?

1188
01:06:33,882 --> 01:06:34,785
I don't know.

1189
01:06:37,691 --> 01:06:39,025
You think it's her?

1190
01:06:39,027 --> 01:06:40,594
- Chuchu?
- Yeah.

1191
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:41,763
Fuck yeah, I think it's her.

1192
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:43,633
She's the fuckin' voodoo curse.

1193
01:06:43,635 --> 01:06:45,136
Tried to kill her, I
fuckin' saved her ass.

1194
01:06:45,138 --> 01:06:47,608
Stupid, I'm doomed to
be with that fucked up

1195
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:49,079
ginger broad and she's
fuckin' annoying, by the way.

1196
01:06:49,081 --> 01:06:50,683
Hey, hey, hey.
Donny, relax. Donny.

1197
01:06:50,685 --> 01:06:51,952
Shit she put me through
the past couple days,

1198
01:06:51,954 --> 01:06:54,790
you would not believe
bro, seriously.

1199
01:06:54,792 --> 01:06:56,861
You need to fuckin' move
away from me right now, okay?

1200
01:06:56,863 --> 01:06:58,097
Seriously.

1201
01:06:58,099 --> 01:07:01,505
- Good morning, lovers!
- Jesus.

1202
01:07:01,507 --> 01:07:02,807
How was your night?

1203
01:07:02,809 --> 01:07:03,975
Freddie, you're back.

1204
01:07:03,977 --> 01:07:06,181
- Z.
- Oh, my God. Oh!

1205
01:07:06,183 --> 01:07:09,189
- I'm gonna go tell Nick.
- Okay.

1206
01:07:15,602 --> 01:07:16,504
Thanks.

1207
01:07:18,741 --> 01:07:20,075
Think nothin' of it.

1208
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:21,679
I really mean it, Freddie,

1209
01:07:21,681 --> 01:07:23,917
I'd have gone away, gone away.

1210
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:25,253
Thank you.

1211
01:07:25,255 --> 01:07:30,095
It was a shitty prize anyway.

1212
01:07:30,097 --> 01:07:32,200
- Feed me?
- Yeah.

1213
01:07:32,202 --> 01:07:33,602
- Please?
- Alright.

1214
01:07:34,874 --> 01:07:37,080
Hey, Nick, Freddie's back.

1215
01:07:38,215 --> 01:07:39,816
What?

1216
01:07:39,818 --> 01:07:41,152
Hey, don't go anywhere.

1217
01:07:41,154 --> 01:07:42,056
Yeah.

1218
01:07:46,699 --> 01:07:48,169
What the hell are
you lookin' at?

1219
01:07:51,977 --> 01:07:53,278
Where the fuck are they, Z?

1220
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,351
They were right here.

1221
01:07:56,353 --> 01:07:58,654
Shit, we gotta go, man.

1222
01:07:58,656 --> 01:07:59,358
Fuck!

1223
01:08:03,232 --> 01:08:04,899
Where's Donny and that chick?

1224
01:08:04,901 --> 01:08:06,704
They were with you,
man, what happened?

1225
01:08:06,706 --> 01:08:08,308
Hey, wanna bite?

1226
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:10,946
- Hi.
- Hi!

1227
01:08:10,948 --> 01:08:13,686
Z, stay in case
they come back, okay?

1228
01:08:13,688 --> 01:08:14,687
No.

1229
01:08:14,689 --> 01:08:15,790
Otto, stay with Z.

1230
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:17,026
Okay.

1231
01:08:17,028 --> 01:08:18,929
- Freddie, you coming?
- Mm-hmm.

1232
01:08:18,931 --> 01:08:21,066
We'll be back in like
an hour and a half?

1233
01:08:21,068 --> 01:08:22,303
- All right.
- Bye, guys.

1234
01:08:22,305 --> 01:08:24,775
See you.

1235
01:08:24,777 --> 01:08:27,350
Why the fuck did
you say that, man?

1236
01:08:30,723 --> 01:08:31,792
Yep.

1237
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:35,296
Always left behind.

1238
01:08:35,298 --> 01:08:37,967
Don't complain, man.

1239
01:08:37,969 --> 01:08:38,970
Otto.

1240
01:08:38,972 --> 01:08:40,106
Hmm?

1241
01:08:40,108 --> 01:08:42,244
Otto.

1242
01:08:42,246 --> 01:08:44,151
This is real bad, man.

1243
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,923
Fucker, is that Donny?

1244
01:08:47,925 --> 01:08:49,429
What the fuck is going on, dude?

1245
01:08:53,837 --> 01:08:55,139
Come on, help me.

1246
01:08:57,043 --> 01:08:58,846
Help me, fuck!

1247
01:08:58,848 --> 01:09:01,416
Freddie, what happened?

1248
01:09:01,418 --> 01:09:03,020
I got arrested.

1249
01:09:03,022 --> 01:09:05,023
I know that.

1250
01:09:05,025 --> 01:09:06,327
When'd you get out?

1251
01:09:06,329 --> 01:09:07,462
Last night.

1252
01:09:07,464 --> 01:09:09,333
Where you been?

1253
01:09:09,335 --> 01:09:12,775
Eating bonbons in
the back of a limo.

1254
01:09:12,777 --> 01:09:14,277
Come on, Nick, where do
you think I've been?

1255
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:15,346
Hey.

1256
01:09:15,348 --> 01:09:16,547
Yeah?

1257
01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:18,251
Come on, talk to me.

1258
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:19,386
Really?

1259
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:22,093
Yeah, really.

1260
01:09:22,095 --> 01:09:26,500
Okay, I got arrested
and then I got out

1261
01:09:26,502 --> 01:09:29,976
and some really fucked up people
helped me get here

1262
01:09:29,978 --> 01:09:31,947
and that's it.

1263
01:09:31,949 --> 01:09:35,085
Nothing bad happened to you?

1264
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,288
Like?

1265
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:39,228
Freddie, come on.

1266
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:41,168
I'm good, okay?

1267
01:09:42,502 --> 01:09:45,976
Really happy to see you.

1268
01:09:45,978 --> 01:09:47,314
I'm happy to see Otto and Z.

1269
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:50,453
And...

1270
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:55,531
I'm happy to finally relax.

1271
01:09:57,299 --> 01:09:58,436
I'm tired.

1272
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:02,379
I'm really tired.

1273
01:10:18,177 --> 01:10:20,379
We don't have
the fuckin' keys.

1274
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:21,482
I got this.

1275
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:23,020
- Got a knife?
- Yeah.

1276
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,501
Where'd you learn this,
Connecticut?

1277
01:10:31,503 --> 01:10:32,540
Nantucket.

1278
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:55,554
Nick, hi.

1279
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:01,395
Guy, do you remember Nick?

1280
01:11:01,397 --> 01:11:02,732
Nick's a friend of Daddy's

1281
01:11:02,734 --> 01:11:04,336
and a business associate.

1282
01:11:04,338 --> 01:11:07,409
Hey, Bird, this is Freddie.

1283
01:11:07,411 --> 01:11:08,746
She's an artist.

1284
01:11:08,748 --> 01:11:12,451
Nice, I'm a sculptor.

1285
01:11:12,453 --> 01:11:14,555
Well, looks like you did
real well with that one.

1286
01:11:14,557 --> 01:11:17,595
I did, but I had some help.

1287
01:11:17,597 --> 01:11:20,770
Rod, Nick's here!

1288
01:11:20,772 --> 01:11:23,241
He's feeling so
much better today.

1289
01:11:23,243 --> 01:11:25,446
Aren't you?
Wanna hold him?

1290
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:28,584
Oh, no, not really,
that's not my thing.

1291
01:11:28,586 --> 01:11:30,121
Aw, you're a natural.

1292
01:11:30,123 --> 01:11:31,190
Nick, good to see ya, buddy.

1293
01:11:31,192 --> 01:11:32,192
Hey, man.

1294
01:11:32,194 --> 01:11:34,130
Hi, I'm Freddie.

1295
01:11:34,132 --> 01:11:35,533
Nice to meet you.

1296
01:11:35,535 --> 01:11:36,736
Freddie, I'm Rod,
nice to meet you.

1297
01:11:36,738 --> 01:11:37,737
You want a beer?

1298
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:39,140
Yeah, sure.

1299
01:11:39,142 --> 01:11:40,345
Come on in.

1300
01:11:51,834 --> 01:11:53,404
You light it?

1301
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:55,343
Yeah, yesterday.

1302
01:12:03,225 --> 01:12:05,360
I gotta say it

1303
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:06,530
just 'cause I gotta say it.

1304
01:12:06,532 --> 01:12:07,732
It's good stuff, man.

1305
01:12:07,734 --> 01:12:10,772
This is Angel's money.

1306
01:12:10,774 --> 01:12:12,510
I can't have any
shit going down.

1307
01:12:12,512 --> 01:12:14,483
You're gonna be asking me
for more next week.

1308
01:12:19,826 --> 01:12:20,794
Good shit, Nick.

1309
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:32,450
You know, there's not a time
in my life I've been happier.

1310
01:12:32,452 --> 01:12:34,456
That's awesome, Rod.

1311
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:44,677
Cute kid, homie.

1312
01:12:48,685 --> 01:12:49,786
Do anything to
protect our babies,

1313
01:12:49,788 --> 01:12:50,955
now wouldn't we, huh?

1314
01:12:50,957 --> 01:12:53,526
Who the fuck are you?

1315
01:12:53,528 --> 01:12:54,728
Get your hands off
my fuckin' kid.

1316
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:55,997
Hey, hey, hey, relax, man.

1317
01:12:55,999 --> 01:12:57,835
Just call me the
candy man, homeboy.

1318
01:12:57,837 --> 01:13:00,842
You just gotta stand there
and listen, stay calm, homie.

1319
01:13:00,844 --> 01:13:03,981
Hey, you just relax, alright?

1320
01:13:03,983 --> 01:13:05,752
- Oh, yeah.
- Shit.

1321
01:13:05,754 --> 01:13:06,954
What's up, motherfuckers?

1322
01:13:06,956 --> 01:13:08,858
Shoot him, ese, shoot him now!

1323
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:11,831
See, all I wanted to do
is kill this dumbass.

1324
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:13,534
Get your ass back in the car.

1325
01:13:13,536 --> 01:13:15,773
All I want to do was
kill this dumbass ho.

1326
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,610
Stay still! And then I got to
thinkin', I said,

1327
01:13:18,612 --> 01:13:22,954
"Self, why don't we put Lobo
in his motherfuckin' place,

1328
01:13:22,956 --> 01:13:25,658
in a body bag," and then
I'm gonna kill you

1329
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:27,495
like I was gonna
do anyway, right?

1330
01:13:27,497 --> 01:13:30,069
Shh. This my favorite part,
this my favorite part,

1331
01:13:30,071 --> 01:13:31,705
this is my favorite part.

1332
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:34,711
We make a ton of money,
that's what we call

1333
01:13:34,713 --> 01:13:35,713
gettin' paid for
doing what we love.

1334
01:13:35,715 --> 01:13:37,416
Right, Beef?

1335
01:13:37,418 --> 01:13:38,986
And that's why we
takin' all the money.

1336
01:13:38,988 --> 01:13:41,657
Oh, we gonna take all
the motherfuckin' money.

1337
01:13:41,659 --> 01:13:44,698
Fucking asshole!

1338
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:45,800
Fuckin' kill you!

1339
01:13:45,802 --> 01:13:47,338
I'll fucking kill you!

1340
01:13:49,409 --> 01:13:52,380
Man, shoot this bitch, Beef!

1341
01:13:52,382 --> 01:13:55,723
Oh!

1342
01:13:58,829 --> 01:14:00,865
Give me my fucking kid,

1343
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:02,935
you fucking wetback scum,
before I blow your brains

1344
01:14:02,937 --> 01:14:04,138
all over this fuckin' place.

1345
01:14:06,912 --> 01:14:09,782
Oh, I can taste it.
I can taste it, hey.

1346
01:14:09,784 --> 01:14:14,659
Hey, you got the baby wipes?
Oh! Oh! Okay.

1347
01:14:14,661 --> 01:14:16,730
Can I ask a question?

1348
01:14:16,732 --> 01:14:19,001
Oh, shit, man,
it's Helen Keller.

1349
01:14:19,003 --> 01:14:21,641
Helen, oh! Oh! Oh!

1350
01:14:21,643 --> 01:14:23,778
See, see,
now I can fuck you now!

1351
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,848
Can somebody please tell me
what the hell is going on?

1352
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:28,187
Like seriously, how the
fuck do you guys get here?

1353
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:29,923
That ain't none of
your damn business,

1354
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:31,160
little white whore.

1355
01:14:31,162 --> 01:14:32,831
Oh, my God.

1356
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:34,735
I'm not a fucking whore!

1357
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:37,440
Seriously, I have been
arrested, hustled,

1358
01:14:37,442 --> 01:14:39,611
jerked off on and sold today,

1359
01:14:39,613 --> 01:14:41,849
all with less than
two hours of sleep.

1360
01:14:41,851 --> 01:14:44,187
So if you kill me right now,
I would probably feel

1361
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:47,193
so much fuckin' better
than I do.

1362
01:14:47,195 --> 01:14:48,863
So will someone please
just tell me what the fuck

1363
01:14:48,865 --> 01:14:51,067
is going on
so if I die right now,

1364
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:53,038
at least I know why?

1365
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,775
Hey, man, shoot her, man.

1366
01:14:54,777 --> 01:14:56,580
It was for your protection,
it was protection.

1367
01:14:56,582 --> 01:14:59,585
It was about buying
protection for the wetback.

1368
01:14:59,587 --> 01:15:00,920
Sorry, but right?

1369
01:15:00,922 --> 01:15:02,157
Because one of your boys
was killed?

1370
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,627
Beef, shoot her ass!

1371
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:04,996
Man, I shot the
last one, alright?

1372
01:15:04,998 --> 01:15:06,734
I got brain in
my eye right now.

1373
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:07,869
Oh, but that's right, isn't it?

1374
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:09,037
- Fuck it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1375
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:10,841
Not happening, fat boy.

1376
01:15:10,843 --> 01:15:12,144
Oh, my God, please don't
fucking shoot each other.

1377
01:15:12,146 --> 01:15:13,982
Please, please!

1378
01:15:13,984 --> 01:15:15,283
Just tell me how much money
you're fighting over.

1379
01:15:15,285 --> 01:15:16,552
Shut up, Freddie!

1380
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,122
No, tell me how much money!

1381
01:15:18,124 --> 01:15:20,027
Freddie, shut the fuck up.

1382
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:22,966
If it's less than $300,000,
you all need to fuckin'

1383
01:15:22,968 --> 01:15:26,139
stop shushing me and hear me out

1384
01:15:26,141 --> 01:15:29,012
'cause I've got a story to tell.

1385
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:39,233
I'm listening.

1386
01:15:42,742 --> 01:15:44,144
Hi, Mickey!

1387
01:15:44,146 --> 01:15:45,880
Oh, it's good to see you.

1388
01:15:45,882 --> 01:15:48,251
Ya know, I was gonna say sorry

1389
01:15:48,253 --> 01:15:50,323
for being late on my
first day of work,

1390
01:15:50,325 --> 01:15:53,329
but then I thought,

1391
01:15:53,331 --> 01:15:57,604
huh, I clocked in
hours ago, didn't I?

1392
01:15:57,606 --> 01:16:01,712
So, uh, no sorries for you.

1393
01:16:01,714 --> 01:16:04,151
How the hell did you
know where I lived?

1394
01:16:04,153 --> 01:16:06,756
Good trick knows
everything about her pimp.

1395
01:16:08,296 --> 01:16:10,965
But I'm not mad, so, um,

1396
01:16:10,967 --> 01:16:12,402
why don't you invite me in
and I'll tell you

1397
01:16:12,404 --> 01:16:14,238
everything that happened.

1398
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,343
Who is it, babe?

1399
01:16:16,345 --> 01:16:18,381
Hi, I'm Mickey's sister.

1400
01:16:18,383 --> 01:16:21,420
He doesn't really talk about
our side of the family much

1401
01:16:21,422 --> 01:16:23,256
'cause he's embarrassed.

1402
01:16:23,258 --> 01:16:25,429
It's 'cause Mom's
a stripper, isn't it?

1403
01:16:25,431 --> 01:16:27,900
Same old dirty Daddy though.

1404
01:16:27,902 --> 01:16:29,302
Frank had other kids?

1405
01:16:29,304 --> 01:16:30,872
No, she's lying.

1406
01:16:30,874 --> 01:16:32,108
True.

1407
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:35,849
He actually drugged me
and sold me

1408
01:16:35,851 --> 01:16:42,095
just this morning to a
real ugly fella for $200.

1409
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,899
That sounds more like
the Mickey you know,

1410
01:16:43,901 --> 01:16:45,937
doesn't it?

1411
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:49,476
So what do you want?

1412
01:16:49,478 --> 01:16:53,221
Oh, Mickey.

1413
01:16:54,756 --> 01:16:56,959
It's not me that wants it.

1414
01:16:59,735 --> 01:17:00,904
Boom, boom, boom.

1415
01:17:02,473 --> 01:17:03,677
It's them.

1416
01:17:05,879 --> 01:17:07,848
Oh, that was good.

1417
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:11,222
Admit it, that was so good.

1418
01:17:11,224 --> 01:17:12,925
Oh, and they're like totally
gonna rob you right now.

1419
01:17:12,927 --> 01:17:14,128
Yeah.

1420
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:17,167
And how did I know
where you lived?

1421
01:17:17,169 --> 01:17:19,973
I looked in your
glove box, asshole.

1422
01:17:19,975 --> 01:17:21,143
You gotta be fucking
kidding me right now.

1423
01:17:21,145 --> 01:17:23,049
Shut the fuck up.

1424
01:17:27,223 --> 01:17:29,192
Shit.

1425
01:17:29,194 --> 01:17:31,396
Let fucking go of me,
you piece of shit.

1426
01:17:31,398 --> 01:17:33,835
Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't
like to be talked to like that.

1427
01:17:33,837 --> 01:17:36,106
Fuck this little kid, Mickey!
Do something!

1428
01:17:36,108 --> 01:17:37,911
What exactly do you want me
to fucking do right now?

1429
01:17:37,913 --> 01:17:39,948
Something, damn it!

1430
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:41,183
Stop fucking smelling me.

1431
01:17:41,185 --> 01:17:43,121
Oh, shit, you bitch.

1432
01:17:43,123 --> 01:17:44,457
You broke my fucking nose!

1433
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:45,860
Handle your business, Beef.

1434
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:47,831
Shoot this bitch.

1435
01:17:51,606 --> 01:17:53,409
Yeah, she broke it.

1436
01:17:53,411 --> 01:17:55,078
She broke my nose.

1437
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:59,521
So, are you gonna tell us
where the money is

1438
01:17:59,523 --> 01:18:01,325
or do we have to find it?

1439
01:18:01,327 --> 01:18:04,231
You think I'm fucking
scared of you bitches?

1440
01:18:04,233 --> 01:18:06,302
Coming into my fuckin' house,
let's go, come on.

1441
01:18:06,304 --> 01:18:10,109
Let's go.

1442
01:18:10,111 --> 01:18:13,014
Whoa, okay!

1443
01:18:13,016 --> 01:18:16,390
You must be stupid or you
just wanna fuckin' die.

1444
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:18,994
Get this dumb motherfucker
out my face.

1445
01:18:18,996 --> 01:18:22,133
Shut the hell up, man, yo,
get the stuff, man, let's go.

1446
01:18:22,135 --> 01:18:25,341
Ain't no beef in the house,
man, let's go, sit down!

1447
01:18:25,343 --> 01:18:26,446
Sit down.

1448
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,450
Get that fucking gun
outta my face.

1449
01:18:30,452 --> 01:18:36,030
Mickey's getting robbed.
Mickey's getting robbed.

1450
01:18:36,032 --> 01:18:39,436
Mickey, Mickey, Mickey.

1451
01:18:41,207 --> 01:18:43,513
Isn't this fun?

1452
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:48,254
I'm gonna find you and
you're gonna pay for this.

1453
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:50,659
You little fucking cunt.

1454
01:18:50,661 --> 01:18:55,402
Oh, oh.

1455
01:18:55,404 --> 01:18:57,405
Little cunt?

1456
01:18:57,407 --> 01:18:58,643
- Really?
- Yeah.

1457
01:19:03,587 --> 01:19:08,496
Ya know, you should
be a nicer hostess.

1458
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:11,204
Your guests might turn on you
with this attitude.

1459
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,143
You fuckin' bitch.

1460
01:19:15,145 --> 01:19:17,116
- Hi, guys!
- Fuckin' bitch.

1461
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:22,393
Come on, come on.

1462
01:19:29,074 --> 01:19:31,209
Oh, the American dream, baby.

1463
01:19:31,211 --> 01:19:32,644
You over here beatin' up Barbie.

1464
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:37,155
Oh, man, oh, yes.

1465
01:19:37,157 --> 01:19:38,624
Did I do good?

1466
01:19:38,626 --> 01:19:41,397
Oh, you did, Helen!
Oh, you did good.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,

1469

01:19:50,217 --> 01:19:51,283
Hey, put the phone down.

1474
01:19:51,285 --> 01:19:52,286
Hey, shut the fuck up, man,

1476
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:55,592
Look, that wasn't the
part of the fuckin' deal.

1477
01:19:55,594 --> 01:19:56,794
It's part of the
fuckin' deal, alright?

1478
01:19:56,796 --> 01:19:57,796
- No, it ain't.
- Yes, it is.

1479
01:19:57,798 --> 01:19:58,832
No, it wasn't!

1480
01:19:58,834 --> 01:20:00,101
What you gonna do, huh?

1481
01:20:00,103 --> 01:20:01,103
Put the phone down.

1482
01:20:01,105 --> 01:20:02,439
We gotta go.

1483
01:20:02,441 --> 01:20:03,676
Yeah, I
will take your ass out.

1484
01:20:03,678 --> 01:20:05,413
No, no, no, no.

1485
01:20:05,415 --> 01:20:06,415
Let go of me.

1486
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:07,684
We're leaving now.

1487
01:20:07,686 --> 01:20:09,287
No, you've done
enough for today.

1488
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:10,523
Stop it, Nick.

1489
01:20:10,525 --> 01:20:11,658
Not a game, Freddie.

1490
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:14,196
Okay, fine, fucking stop.

1491
01:20:14,198 --> 01:20:17,303
Gosh, you can stop
manhandling me.

1492
01:20:27,427 --> 01:20:28,728
See what you made me do?

1493
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:29,730
I had to shoot the damn phone.

1494
01:20:33,805 --> 01:20:36,212
Okay, I just wanted
to say goodbye.

1495
01:20:38,616 --> 01:20:40,752
You are fuckin' ridiculous.

1496
01:20:40,754 --> 01:20:42,822
I know. Um...

1497
01:20:42,824 --> 01:20:44,162
Thanks for not
shooting each other.

1498
01:20:45,865 --> 01:20:47,532
I hope you buy
lots of nice things

1499
01:20:47,534 --> 01:20:49,703
and like, ya know,
take each other out

1500
01:20:49,705 --> 01:20:51,475
for fancy meals and stuff.

1501
01:20:52,811 --> 01:20:55,547
Listen, I'm not
a gang obviously.

1502
01:20:55,549 --> 01:20:56,852
Mm-mm.

1503
01:20:56,854 --> 01:20:58,893
But thanks for
letting me pretend.

1504
01:21:02,432 --> 01:21:03,334
You welcome.

1505
01:21:09,846 --> 01:21:12,687
She brings something
special outta me.

1506
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:24,307
It's bad business
selling little girls.

1507
01:21:24,309 --> 01:21:26,912
Ya know,

1508
01:21:26,914 --> 01:21:31,355
I hope you live through this.

1509
01:21:31,357 --> 01:21:33,627
But if you don't,

1510
01:21:33,629 --> 01:21:37,668
you only have yourself to blame.

1511
01:22:16,585 --> 01:22:19,989
Hit me, hit me!

1512
01:22:19,991 --> 01:22:22,427
Oh.

1513
01:22:22,429 --> 01:22:24,699
Donny, hey!

1514
01:22:24,701 --> 01:22:25,768
Hey.

1515
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:26,803
You got my money, ese?

1516
01:22:26,805 --> 01:22:28,873
Yeah.

1517
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:29,875
Where's Chuchu?

1518
01:22:29,877 --> 01:22:33,718
Uh, I lost her.

1519
01:22:36,124 --> 01:22:37,793
Nice work.

1520
01:22:37,795 --> 01:22:39,094
Where?

1521
01:22:39,096 --> 01:22:40,765
In the desert.

1522
01:22:40,767 --> 01:22:43,469
We were kinda high
and I lost her

1523
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:45,641
but I'm sure she's fine though.
Okay?

1524
01:22:45,643 --> 01:22:46,910
Who fucking cares
if she's fine?

1525
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,946
I fucking care, okay?

1526
01:22:47,948 --> 01:22:49,149
So shut the fuck up, outlaw.

1527
01:22:49,151 --> 01:22:50,619
- Oh, shut the fuck up?
- Yeah.

1528
01:22:50,621 --> 01:22:52,793
You shut the fuck up.

1529
01:22:59,773 --> 01:23:02,575
Ah, my little Indian whore!

1530
01:23:03,913 --> 01:23:05,784
Alright, I'm
gonna take off, man.

1531
01:23:05,786 --> 01:23:07,687
Hey, hey, hey, Donny.

1532
01:23:07,689 --> 01:23:09,757
Wait, come here.

1533
01:23:09,759 --> 01:23:11,628
No, no, no, no.
No more gifts, alright?

1534
01:23:11,630 --> 01:23:12,930
Please, Venice, would you
tell him no more gifts.

1535
01:23:12,932 --> 01:23:14,266
Paolo, I totally
lost the last one.

1536
01:23:14,268 --> 01:23:15,738
I can't do this again,
alright, please.

1537
01:23:18,844 --> 01:23:20,647
Aw.

1538
01:23:20,649 --> 01:23:22,850
This is you.

1539
01:23:22,853 --> 01:23:25,225
Take it.
Take it.

1540
01:23:27,898 --> 01:23:29,601
You're in your own hands now.

1541
01:23:31,972 --> 01:23:34,908
And now, you're in my hands.

1542
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:36,078
No!

1543
01:23:40,657 --> 01:23:44,732
Thank you.

1544
01:23:46,769 --> 01:23:47,937
I'll see ya.

1545
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,796
Rod, by the way,

1546
01:24:00,798 --> 01:24:03,166
I'm super sorry
about what happened.

1547
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:05,275
Nah, it's all sorted.

1548
01:24:09,649 --> 01:24:12,856
Anyway, I kinda miss
that rush, you know?

1549
01:24:15,395 --> 01:24:18,097
It's good.

1550
01:24:18,099 --> 01:24:19,401
Did you bury her?

1551
01:24:19,403 --> 01:24:20,769
Hey.

1552
01:24:20,771 --> 01:24:22,873
Nick, it's okay.

1553
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:24,912
Yeah.

1554
01:24:24,914 --> 01:24:26,850
Yeah, I did.

1555
01:24:26,852 --> 01:24:27,753
Good.

1556
01:24:31,027 --> 01:24:33,863
Rod, would you mind if
I made a phone call?

1557
01:24:33,865 --> 01:24:36,870
It's long distance,
but it won't be too long.

1558
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:38,104
Sure, kid, phone's in the back.

1559
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:39,076
Thank you.

1560
01:24:45,824 --> 01:24:47,793
Who you calling?

1561
01:24:47,795 --> 01:24:48,797
My brother.

1562
01:24:50,132 --> 01:24:52,968
Ah, okay.

1563
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:54,840
I'll see ya out there.

1564
01:24:54,842 --> 01:24:55,778
Yeah.

1565
01:24:57,748 --> 01:24:59,252
The Victims.

1566
01:25:01,756 --> 01:25:02,658
What?

1567
01:25:04,495 --> 01:25:07,365
That would've
been my gang name.

1568
01:25:07,367 --> 01:25:08,270
Deception tactic.

1569
01:25:10,172 --> 01:25:11,506
You're dangerous.

1570
01:25:11,508 --> 01:25:14,885
Don't confuse
tactics with character.

1571
01:25:25,973 --> 01:25:26,874
Hello?

1572
01:25:27,976 --> 01:25:29,177
Hugo?

1573
01:25:29,179 --> 01:25:30,180
So good to hear your voice.

1574
01:25:30,182 --> 01:25:31,182
How are you, buddy?

1575
01:25:31,184 --> 01:25:33,353
I'm cool, where are you?

1576
01:25:33,355 --> 01:25:34,355
Southern California.

1577
01:25:34,357 --> 01:25:35,923
Just below LA.

1578
01:25:35,925 --> 01:25:37,193
Hey, is Mom there?

1579
01:25:37,195 --> 01:25:38,997
Um, date with Richard.

1580
01:25:38,999 --> 01:25:40,834
Good, okay, are you
ready for this story?

1581
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:42,537
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, so last night,

1582
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:44,175
I was in the hood,
and I ended up

1583
01:25:44,177 --> 01:25:47,014
in the middle of this
crazy ass race war.

1584
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:48,918
- In Compton?
- Close.

1585
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,320
Were people getting shot at?

1586
01:25:50,322 --> 01:25:52,191
No, but these two gangsters
kept threatening

1587
01:25:52,193 --> 01:25:54,061
- to beat me up.
- What?

1588
01:25:54,063 --> 01:25:56,200
Yeah, but then we all became
friends, so it was okay.

1589
01:25:56,202 --> 01:25:58,938
No way.

1590
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,140
Yeah,
oh, and guess what!

1591
01:26:00,142 --> 01:26:01,277
What?

1592
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:03,248
Lowrider mission
accomplished.

1593
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:06,022
Holy crap, did
they have hydraulics?

1594
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:15,204
Yeah, it was pretty wild.

1595
01:26:15,206 --> 01:26:18,912
I really wish that you
were with me for that part.

1596
01:26:18,914 --> 01:26:20,082
How's everything back home?

1597
01:26:20,084 --> 01:26:21,251
Fine.

1598
01:26:21,253 --> 01:26:22,319
And Mom?

1599
01:26:22,321 --> 01:26:24,156
I don't know.

1600
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:25,959
I miss you both.

1601
01:26:25,961 --> 01:26:27,530
Miss you too.

1602
01:26:27,532 --> 01:26:30,168
But don't come home for us.

1603
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:31,504
Okay?

1604
01:26:31,506 --> 01:26:32,442
Promise?

1605
01:26:33,946 --> 01:26:35,181
Yeah, I promise.

1606
01:26:36,651 --> 01:26:38,485
Alright, will you tell Mom
that I love her

1607
01:26:38,487 --> 01:26:39,489
and not to worry?

1608
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:42,362
She raised me right.

1609
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:45,701
See you soon.

1610
01:26:45,703 --> 01:26:47,638
I promise.

1611
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,675
Love you, bye.

1612
01:26:48,677 --> 01:26:49,578
Bye.

1613
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,734
Ooh. Okay.

1614
