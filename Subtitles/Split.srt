1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,816
Happy birthday to me!

3
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,114
Happy birthday!

4
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,198
- Oh, my God!
- Anybody want this?

5
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,513
That's what happens when
you do a mercy invite.

6
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,995
I believed you wanted
to invite everyone.

7
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,311
Dad, I can't invite everyone in my
art class except for one person

8
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,231
without social
networking evidence

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,440
inflicting more pain on that
person than was intended.

10
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,748
And I'm not a monster.

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,831
I'm proud of you.
I think.

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,068
She gets detention a lot
and she yells

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,037
at teachers sometimes.

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,111
There was that rumor
that went around

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,031
that she just kept
running away from home.

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
Um, maybe she can Uber.

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,856
I seriously believe
that we can go home now.

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,474
Um, did I mistakenly convey
this was a democracy?

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,518
We are not going
till she gets picked up.

20
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,192
Uh, the car broke down.

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,360
I'm just gonna
take the bus.

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,231
You're not taking a bus.
I'll drive you home.

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,993
Claire has almost saved her half
of the money she needs for a car.

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Isn't that right?

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,513
This'll be one of the few times left
I can drive you guys around. Huh?

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,152
Uh, I...

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,231
You won't be able to
hear my dad tell jokes

28
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,958
that only he thinks
are funny

29
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,759
for an entire car ride
unless you come.

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,791
You don't really
wanna miss that.

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Wow! I got more gifts
than I thought I did.

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,800
Can I put this
in here?

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,440
Yeah, I'll get it.
Thank you, Marcia.

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,800
Maybe he just is into...

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,719
Maybe he's just content
where he is.

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,399
Hey. Can I help you?

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,675
What?

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,637
This is the one.
He's really funny.

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,228
He does
these weekly videos.

40
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,756
See? It's so random.
That is so weird.

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,760
Yeah,
you have a crush on him.

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,016
- I don't get it.
- Pause it.

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,296
Yeah, go back.
Why don't you get it?

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,436
I just don't get it.
He's blond and he's cute.

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,551
No, his eyebrows
are just like...

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,914
Shut up. His eyebrows?

47
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,456
That's the one thing
you couldn't get?

48
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Yeah.

49
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,393
Oh, my God.

50
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,909
Oh. You see
what he does, though?

51
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,237
How does he even do that?

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,776
That's the whole
point why I'm showing you.

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,119
Genius!

54
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,639
So bad.

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Hey!

56
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,349
Pardon me, sir. I think
you have the wrong car.

57
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,511
We woke up in here.

58
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,637
What the hell is going on?

59
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,952
What are we doing here?

60
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,838
What happened to my dad?

61
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,479
He's out there.

62
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,510
Do you know what
happened to my dad?

63
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,391
I choose you first.

64
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,911
It's only gonna be
a minute.

65
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,233
Pee on yourself.

66
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
No!

67
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,835
No.

68
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,515
No!

69
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,434
No!

70
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
No!

71
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,750
Open the door!

72
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,071
Hey, are you okay?

73
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,078
He wanted me
to dance for him.

74
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,711
The outside door
is locked.

75
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,118
Everything's okay.

76
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,759
We're okay.

77
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,914
We're okay.

78
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,115
I hear
the tiniest little splash

79
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,713
and here it comes.

80
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,553
A freak of nature,
like this.

81
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,631
So, he comes across
the stream

82
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,478
and he's so tall

83
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,393
that the water doesn't even
get to his belly.

84
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,471
Then he stops.

85
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,552
And my heart's
coming out of my chest.

86
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,391
You got buck fever.

87
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,755
Uncle John's got buck fever.

88
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,317
That's not true, Casey.
Your daddy's a liar.

89
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,515
How big was the rack?

90
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
It was huge.

91
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,816
Where are you supposed to
look when you shoot, Casey?

92
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,909
At the body.

93
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,336
Then why was he
looking at the rack?

94
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,476
'Cause he had buck fever.

95
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,273
She'll say anything you say.

96
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,873
You gonna do that
when you get your

97
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,632
mentored hunting license
in three years?

98
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,353
No, sir.

99
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,034
Make sure you put your
gloves on after you finish.

100
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,475
Your feet and your hands
get cold first out there.

101
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,308
Three students abducted.

102
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,879
The father of
one of the students

103
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,393
woke up dazed
in King of Prussia,

104
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,629
reportedly drugged.

105
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,870
He found the kids
and the car missing.

106
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,952
Neighbors are in disbelief.

107
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,399
A normally quiet community

108
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,556
is reeling after this abduction.

109
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,312
If you have any information concerning
the whereabouts of these girls,

110
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,914
you are urged to
contact the police.

111
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,109
It doesn't matter
if you open that door, Claire.

112
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,350
There's a second locked door.

113
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,516
He's gonna come in
here again, any second,

114
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,239
and we're not letting him
take one of us out again.

115
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,276
We just cried and screamed
and we didn't hurt him

116
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,352
because we were afraid
to get him upset.

117
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,874
God, that's victim shit.
Jesus!

118
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,430
We should fight him.

119
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,875
We should drop
a crazy-ass bomb on him.

120
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,873
I saw him carry one of you

121
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,030
and lay you on the bed
like you weighed nothing.

122
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,630
One punch from him
would knock one of us out.

123
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,951
I took six months
of Kenpo karate class.

124
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,873
And you distract
the assailant with pain.

125
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,429
Everything is so easy
for you guys.

126
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,754
You do one thing, you can
predict the next thing.

127
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,714
It's not the way it's gonna
be in this situation.

128
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,438
We're not
getting out of here.

129
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,717
You're saying that you're not gonna
fight with everything in you?

130
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,155
You know the only chance...

131
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,598
The only chance we have is if all
three of us go crazy on this guy.

132
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,556
We have to hurry.

133
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,110
We need you, Casey.

134
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,719
Claire's smart.
Let's listen to her.

135
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,838
I'll do it if
you're gonna do it, too.

136
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
We can win.

137
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,709
He'll hurt us.

138
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,468
No. Shut up.

139
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,317
Both of you.

140
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,314
You're gonna pick your miserable
self up and help us get out of here.

141
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,588
Blow me.

142
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,990
And your six months of karate at the
King of Prussia Mall can blow me, too.

143
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,355
No! No, no, you can't
do this today!

144
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,078
You can't do this
right now.

145
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,991
Why do you do this?
Why do you act like this?

146
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,680
Why do you act like
you're not one of us?

147
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,791
When you're aiming, Casey,

148
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,636
always keep
both eyes open.

149
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,553
Cover your target
with the barrel

150
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,871
then move with it
to get its pace.

151
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,314
I'm warning you, it's gonna be
frustrating the first times.

152
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,153
You're gonna shoot
under it or behind it.

153
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,992
You'll learn to
stay with it.

154
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,237
Females are smarter
than the males.

155
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,992
But you know that,
it's like humans.

156
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,070
Females use their nose
to stay alive.

157
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,639
They make sure
they have cover.

158
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,717
They always remember they're
trying to stay alive.

159
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,348
Bucks go off
by themselves.

160
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,193
Bucks get dumb
during mating season.

161
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,790
Boys make
too much noise.

162
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,270
Yes, they do.

163
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,237
I'm better
than a boy, right?

164
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,079
Yes, you are.

165
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,354
Hey

166
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,358
I'll let you know when I hear
something that makes sense.

167
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,195
We don't even know
what this is yet.

168
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,869
Hey! I was inspired.

169
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,713
No, no, no, that one.

170
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,555
That one, before the pink
frock coat with the thorns.

171
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,995
That's supposed to be
like a tailored jacket,

172
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,913
but I'm gonna hand-print it
with newspaper headlines.

173
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,157
I'm a simple blouse and
skirt person, but these...

174
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,271
These are
very artistic, Barry.

175
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,831
Just the kind of thing Hamptons
ladies would spend $15,000 on

176
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,917
to wear once
at a charity ball.

177
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,792
Shut up!

178
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,150
You know,
I can't stay too long.

179
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,992
This is just a visit.

180
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,196
Well, tell me
what's going on.

181
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,758
What, you mean the email?

182
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,034
No, just the usual things.

183
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,456
Just feelings of
being overwhelmed.

184
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,553
The terseness of your email made it
sound specific and time-related.

185
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,878
Are you looking
for something?

186
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,359
No.
No?

187
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,516
I'm just admiring.
I'm better now.

188
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,675
How's work?

189
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,909
It's great.

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,718
When I last spoke to them,

191
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,553
they believed you were
a model employee.

192
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,030
They found you meticulous
and conscientious.

193
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,312
You know this, right?
I do.

194
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,152
You've managed there
for 10 years.

195
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,878
You're functioning
very well, Barry.

196
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,513
And it's a rare and wonderful
place for you to work.

197
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,908
Yes, it is.

198
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,237
You know, of all my other
clients with your disorder,

199
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,914
you've been the most
consistent at your job.

200
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,711
Did something happen, Barry?

201
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,199
How old are you?

202
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,190
Just... The Internet is
inconsistent on this point.

203
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,351
Why is that on your mind?

204
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,030
Who's gonna look after us
when you retire or pass on?

205
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,634
You know, we're gonna have to
take care of ourselves

206
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,756
and nobody even believes
that we exist.

207
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,514
If ever something
were to happen to me,

208
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,876
I've made arrangements with a colleague
from Baltimore to take over.

209
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,109
Hmm.

210
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,519
Hey, do you, uh...

211
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,399
You live alone?

212
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,834
You know this.

213
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,598
I'm sorry,
I just meant how long?

214
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,079
Always.

215
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,550
That must be so lonely.

216
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,390
Uh, you know what?

217
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,476
I'm doing much better.
I shouldn't have emailed you. I'm just...

218
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,551
Look at me.
I'm too impulsive.

219
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,229
By the way,

220
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,117
is anybody listening?

221
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,072
Does anybody care about us?

222
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
Yes.

223
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,233
The University of Paris has asked
me to do a lecture, in fact.

224
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,676
I'm going to be doing it
via Skype from right here.

225
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,433
People are believing more.

226
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,960
Let's meet at
our usual time next week.

227
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,395
I would rather
you didn't leave, Barry.

228
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,270
Did something happen?

229
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,759
Don't worry.

230
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,909
This was just a visit.

231
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
I'm doing much better,
I actually...

232
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,396
Don't you want
your sketches, Barry?

233
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,469
You're usually very
protective of them.

234
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Yeah.

235
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Thanks.

236
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,797
I'll see you next week
at our usual time.

237
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,150
Thanks for fighting
for us, Dr. Fletcher.

238
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,995
Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.

239
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,553
Welcome.

240
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,816
I just think
I'm gonna blow it.

241
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,876
No, you'll be great.
I'll see you next week.

242
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,149
Okay, thank you.

243
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,833
...DJ's exclusive million dollar

244
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,871
Holiday Bucks Bonanza.

245
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,353
I don't know how you work
with those people.

246
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,554
What people?

247
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,715
Your patients.

248
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,190
You can't use your thumbs
to spin the wheel, dumbasses.

249
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,669
They always use their thumbs.
Oh.

250
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,876
Well, we look at people who've been
shattered and different as less than.

251
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,314
What if

252
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,316
they're more than us?

253
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,035
What?

254
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,715
Do you believe them?
Your patients.

255
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,358
Just between you and me.

256
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,999
Yes, I do.
Hmm.

257
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,837
Flick it! Flick it!

258
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,314
...coming up next,
right after this.

259
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,118
I don't believe it.

260
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,037
No offense.
No.

261
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,776
...but when you call,
we'll send you

262
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,313
a second easyfeet
absolutely free!

263
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,992
Just pay separate processing.

264
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,235
So that's two easyfeet...

265
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,516
Now, that,
I need to buy that.

266
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,628
He's back.

267
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,676
There's a lady outside.

268
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,596
Dennis,
admit what you've done.

269
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,040
Don't get upset.

270
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,673
Don't tell me.

271
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,311
I'm getting frightened.

272
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,590
I thought that you had this
under control.

273
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,830
Please tell me
it's not too late.

274
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,399
The food is waiting.

275
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,759
Is she in that room?

276
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,032
We're here!
Help us!

277
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,349
We're in here!

278
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,759
What is this?
How many are there?

279
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,359
No, don't go in there!

280
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,714
Don't go in there!

281
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,633
Don't worry.

282
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,757
I'll talk to him.

283
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,950
He listens to me.

284
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,878
He's not well.

285
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,115
He knows
what you're here for.

286
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,714
He's not allowed
to touch you.

287
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,313
He knows that.

288
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,799
Mmm-mmm.

289
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,239
Hmm?

290
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,198
Karen.
Joe.

291
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,670
They said you can't have your own
panel at the national conference.

292
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,431
They conceded, however,

293
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,670
that you can be part of
the mood disorder panel.

294
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,796
It's not a mood disorder.

295
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,672
Oh, I'm aware of
your beliefs, Karen.

296
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,353
Well, were they open this
time with the new evidence?

297
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,109
One of your
arguments is a dog?

298
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,274
You submitted video of a
dog acting differently

299
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,191
to one of your patients
at different times?

300
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,032
It is more dramatic
than that.

301
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,033
They are what
they believe they are.

302
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,873
The brain has learned
to defend itself.

303
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,321
You speak of them like
they're supernaturally gifted.

304
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,718
Like they have
powers or something.

305
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,472
Karen, these are patients.

306
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,710
They have been
through trauma.

307
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,718
And perhaps now they are capable
of something we're not.

308
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,153
We have brain scans now.

309
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,440
DID patients have changed their
body chemistry with their thoughts.

310
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,391
He's just trying to
scare us.

311
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,593
He was having a full
conversation with himself.

312
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,399
What was that line about?
"The food is waiting."

313
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,116
Does everyone get
how wacked this is

314
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,156
and that we need to
get out of here now?

315
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,757
No.

316
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,350
Please, keep your area neat.

317
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,272
The bathroom,
it's unacceptable.

318
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,590
To make it easy,
I've color-coded these.

319
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,320
Use the blue bottle
for the floor

320
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,392
and the pink bottle
for the ceramic surfaces.

321
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,118
Uh...

322
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,792
Patricia has reminded me that I
was sent to get you for a reason.

323
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,793
That you are sacred food.

324
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,948
And I promise
not to bother you again.

325
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,395
Maybe he has a dog
or something.

326
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,155
You think he's gonna
feed us to his dogs?

327
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,474
Casey.

328
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,434
Casey!

329
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,359
My name's Hedwig.

330
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,272
I have red socks.

331
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,035
He's on the move.

332
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
What?

333
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
He's...

334
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
on...

335
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
the...

336
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,551
move.

337
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,709
Who?

338
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,591
Someone's coming for you

339
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,558
and you're not gonna
like it.

340
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,790
You guys make noises
in your sleep.

341
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Tell us.

342
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,951
I'm not supposed to say.

343
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,953
But he's done
awful things to people

344
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,877
and he'll do
awful things to you.

345
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,399
I have blue socks, too.

346
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,118
We're his food?

347
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,271
How old are you?

348
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,149
Nine.

349
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,513
So you're not the guy
that took us?

350
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,359
No.

351
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,073
You're not the lady?

352
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,912
What are you, blind?

353
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,875
You don't know
how they think?

354
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,909
No, they don't tell me much.

355
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,718
I just ate a hot dog.

356
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,271
Could you help us, Hedwig?

357
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,553
No, I'm not even
supposed to be here.

358
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,632
I stole the light from Mr. Dennis,
but he'll be back real soon.

359
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,032
I can't steal the light for too
long or he'll know and get angry.

360
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,509
Etcetera.

361
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
See you!

362
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,475
Wait.

363
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,997
We heard something.

364
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,559
We didn't understand it,

365
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,553
but now we do.

366
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,516
Do you know what we heard?

367
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,791
What did you hear?

368
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,353
Come here.

369
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,352
I'll whisper it to you.

370
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,794
Okay.

371
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,439
This guy

372
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,116
is coming for you.

373
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,558
You're a big fibber.

374
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,312
I never lie, Hedwig.

375
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,993
But Mr. Dennis,

376
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,951
he said that he followed
those two girls for four days

377
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,111
and that he knew

378
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,998
that they were the ones
that he would want.

379
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,790
When you're not around,

380
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,036
Dennis and the lady
talk about it.

381
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,998
They talk about how he wants
a boy this time.

382
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,593
They're going to
give him you.

383
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,030
No, Miss Patricia,
she said...

384
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,631
She said she's not mad
at me anymore.

385
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,711
She sings to me sometimes.

386
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,952
I think Miss Patricia
is still a little mad at you.

387
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,910
Miss Patricia thinks I'm...

388
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,038
She thinks I'm stupid.

389
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,675
She thinks I make
silly mistakes.

390
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,429
Look at me.

391
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,554
We're like your babysitters.

392
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,397
We'll let you watch TV
and make you a fun dinner.

393
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,074
We all need to
get out of here.

394
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,635
You could show us
the way out.

395
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,268
We could be gone
before anybody gets back,

396
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,396
but we have to hurry, Hedwig.

397
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,028
We have to hurry
and get out of here.

398
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,668
Wait a minute.

399
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,031
It took forever to
get this place safe

400
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,240
without the nosey bodies
that work here finding out.

401
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,952
You can't get out of here!

402
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
I have to blow my nose.

403
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,838
No, wait!
Please don't go!

404
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,354
Who's coming?

405
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,438
This is
seriously scary.

406
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,919
No one's coming.

407
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,038
He said something.

408
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,953
He said something
about making the room safe.

409
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,398
This is
all new drywall.

410
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,752
What was unsafe?

411
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Wait.

412
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,271
Wait, are we sure
about this?

413
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,592
Casey, you were right.

414
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,599
There's something here.

415
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,917
He was covering up a way out.

416
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,918
Tell me if you see him.

417
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,432
Casey,
tell us what you see.

418
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,829
He's here.

419
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,200
You can't let him in!
You can't let him in!

420
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,838
This is our one chance.

421
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,320
We're not gonna
make it.

422
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,669
Yes, we are!

423
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,360
What?

424
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,639
Hey, what are you guys doing?

425
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Hey.

426
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,952
Okay, quit it.

427
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,634
Okay, guys?

428
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,155
Let me in.

429
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,118
Give us a second.
We're changing.

430
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,828
What are you guys doing?

431
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,029
Let me in.

432
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,192
Guys, you're not being funny.

433
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,190
You're being bitches!
Now, I'm gonna slap you!

434
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,640
I'm gonna slap you
in your face.

435
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,472
Just give me
as much time as you can.

436
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,951
You're gonna get me
into trouble.

437
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Guys...

438
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,479
All right, push up.

439
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Hey!

440
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,829
Hey!

441
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,679
Hey!

442
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,754
I thought I lost you.

443
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,279
Would you, uh...

444
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,311
Would you step outside,
please?

445
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,635
You like to make fun of us.

446
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,314
But we're more powerful
than you think.

447
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,993
Step outside.

448
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Please.

449
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,749
You shouldn't trick children.

450
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,750
That shows who you are.

451
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,796
Look at your sweater.
It's ruined.

452
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,473
It's dirty.

453
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,908
Remove it.

454
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,112
I'm trying to be good.

455
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,437
You will not see
your friend again.

456
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,829
She will be kept separate.

457
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,188
You take off your skirt.
You take off your shirt.

458
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,510
Clothes you got
all dirty from the dust.

459
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,990
One identity in an individual with
Dissociative Identity Disorder

460
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,308
can have high cholesterol.

461
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
One.

462
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,553
There have been cases where one
identity is allergic to bee stings.

463
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,079
The others are not.

464
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,075
Are there moments where two identities
can coexist at the same time?

465
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,959
There are times
when two identities

466
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,237
can take the "light"
or "the spot"

467
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,829
or consciousness
at the same time.

468
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,992
This happened with a student
that I was working with.

469
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,914
And her left and right hand
were taking notes

470
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,631
in different handwritings about
separate things at the same time.

471
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,715
The differences in the
identities can be dramatic.

472
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,555
As much as the difference
between you and me

473
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,837
and every person
in that auditorium.

474
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,637
The identities
have different IQs.

475
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,717
They have different
physical strengths.

476
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,190
One personality is
a Russian weightlifter

477
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,636
and can lift three times
his body weight.

478
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,760
Their ability to hyper-focus

479
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,435
and have different
experiences is astounding.

480
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,311
Have these individuals,
through their suffering,

481
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,597
unlocked the potential
of the brain?

482
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,630
Is this the ultimate doorway

483
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,395
to all things
we call unknown?

484
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,070
Is this where our sense of
the supernatural comes from?

485
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,796
It's about depth

486
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,392
and curves...

487
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,879
Hey, you see that one?

488
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,315
It's kind of like
a chenille sweater-dress.

489
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,713
Who are you?

490
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,948
Barry.

491
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,312
I don't think you are.

492
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,508
I've developed
a nose for sensing

493
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,830
whom I'm talking to
and whom I'm not.

494
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,718
Have I done something?

495
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,553
You've emailed for
an unscheduled appointment

496
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,358
two days in a row.

497
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,876
We're just
feeling overwhelmed.

498
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,277
Garden-variety issues.

499
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,229
I think Orwell or Jade
or Samuel or Heinrich

500
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,834
had the light for a moment
and emailed me.

501
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,434
And you're here to
tell me everything's okay.

502
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,512
I emailed you.

503
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,995
May I talk to
one of them, please?

504
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,277
That can't happen.

505
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,828
I...

506
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,672
I told them that I wanted to

507
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,716
spend the session
with you today.

508
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,315
I'm gonna ask again.

509
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,230
To whom am I
speaking with now?

510
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,672
Dr. Fletcher, it's Barry.

511
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,000
It doesn't seem like Barry.

512
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,469
Barry is
an extroverted leader.

513
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,789
Yes, I am.

514
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,355
I'm gonna take
a professional guess

515
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,354
based on the description
of all 23 identities

516
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,476
that live in Kevin's body,

517
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,070
that I've gotten from Barry.

518
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,995
I think I'm talking
to Dennis.

519
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,117
But he's been banned
from the light

520
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,316
because, among other reasons,

521
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,117
he has a proclivity to watch
young girls dance naked,

522
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,111
which he himself knows
is wrong

523
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,668
and has fought against
with little success.

524
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,513
I'm encouraged
we can finally meet.

525
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,874
And I've guessed this

526
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,874
because you've adjusted the chocolate
dish twice since you came in here

527
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,712
and I understand
you have OCD.

528
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,395
I see. Now, I see.
That's clever.

529
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,516
That's clever,
but I'm not Dennis.

530
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,911
And you and Patricia have
been banned from the light

531
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,638
for quite a while now.

532
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,109
Primarily, shall we say,
because of your beliefs.

533
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,430
Patricia and Dennis
are very unstable.

534
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,999
I'm not Dennis.

535
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,196
Have you both
taken charge now?

536
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,954
Please believe me, I'm Barry.

537
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,353
You must forgive me.

538
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,034
My job is to challenge you.

539
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,756
And, as you must know by now,

540
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,831
I have plenty of
opinions about

541
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,797
how everyone should live
their lives.

542
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,877
Ask me something
about fashion.

543
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,354
I'll prove it.

544
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,559
Look, look, look. Lindt.

545
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,629
Yeah, look.

546
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,391
You see? I'm not Dennis.

547
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,552
You want me to do
something else?

548
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,193
You got ice cream?

549
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,396
Oh, this shirt's
a cotton blend anyway

550
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,471
and the collar is
from three seasons ago.

551
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,796
Snood? I mean, come on.

552
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,995
Jai, what health-conscious
fast food purveyor

553
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,240
did you originally solicit
to buy these chicken wings

554
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,437
you've so lovingly reheated
in a minor suicidal gesture?

555
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,840
Hooters. And you can't just
throw them out, Dr. Fletcher.

556
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,836
Oh, this is wrong
on so many levels.

557
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,470
We finished about 3:15,
so look around 3:18.

558
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,720
You're getting a little soft
around the middle, Jai. Mmm-hmm.

559
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,998
The authors of Hooters play
on our incessant need for fat

560
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,948
and man's incessant need to be in
the proximity of augmented breasts.

561
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,635
It's like Henry V
ran a fast food franchise.

562
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,040
It's a good place,
Dr. Fletcher.

563
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,434
Right.

564
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,870
How'd you know
the trash would be spilled?

565
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,393
How can I say this, Jai?

566
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,074
You're not the most
meticulous of people.

567
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,056
This guy isn't
very neat, is he?

568
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,256
He walked
right through the trash.

569
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,429
No, Jai.

570
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,835
Any normal person
would have walked around it.

571
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,070
That was an act.

572
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,470
What are you
up to, Dennis?

573
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,354
Or is it Patricia
who's deciding things?

574
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,352
We're not gonna die.

575
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,397
Bad things happen.

576
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,431
But not like this.

577
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
Casey...

578
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,639
Talk to me.

579
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,192
We need to get to a window
or a door, or something.

580
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,759
Don't you think?

581
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,756
The thrill, Casey,
is about whether you can

582
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,116
or can't
outsmart this animal.

583
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,869
See, you didn't used to
like to come out here.

584
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,389
This is like our
family tradition, right?

585
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,159
Good shot, big brother.

586
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,359
Thank you, John.

587
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,275
I have your meal, sleepyhead.

588
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,554
Eat.

589
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,748
It's good?

590
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,394
It's got paprika
in it.

591
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,717
I'm sorry.

592
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,158
I think I'll put a pretty
flower in your hair.

593
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,794
There we are.

594
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,708
That's to show
how important you are.

595
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Come along.

596
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,591
We'll have a proper meal.

597
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,555
I understand.

598
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,234
This must all seem
so unsatisfactory for you.

599
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,352
But we are doing
the best we can.

600
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,949
Good?

601
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,154
Hmm?

602
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,318
Can Claire come eat with us?

603
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,480
No.

604
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,475
No, I'm afraid
that can't happen.

605
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,794
She almost ruined
our big reception.

606
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,314
Mmm...

607
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,356
I've heard that Asian people's
music aids digestion.

608
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,595
I'll make you
a second sandwich.

609
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,154
Do you know,

610
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,989
a family of lions
can eat 35 pounds a day?

611
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,679
A buck can lose 30% of its
weight during mating season,

612
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,319
chasing does around.

613
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,152
They're crepuscular, right?

614
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,512
It means they travel around
during dusk and dawn.

615
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,829
Good for you.

616
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,559
It's crooked.

617
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,239
Forgive me.

618
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,876
I don't know if you know,
but tigers have only 30 teeth.

619
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,071
That's 12 less than a dog.

620
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,191
I thought
that was a fun fact.

621
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,920
No.

622
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,760
Marcia.

623
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,753
Marcia, listen to me.

624
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,871
Go to your room.
Shut the door.

625
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,109
Do it now.

626
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,636
"In the sun,
we will find our passion.

627
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,476
"In the sun,
we will find our purpose."

628
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,630
You've always
been protected.

629
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,916
You've never
truly suffered.

630
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,992
And that's why
we chose you.

631
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,191
You've always been asleep.

632
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,836
You never had a chance.

633
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,631
You never had a chance.

634
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,437
The dark-haired girl,
she's gonna be kept in another closet.

635
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,080
You might as well know
at this point.

636
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,512
The Beast,

637
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,477
he's coming for you.

638
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,118
All three of you, you're
gonna be kept separate.

639
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,352
You've got...

640
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,670
You've got a crumb
on your shirt.

641
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,513
Please take it off.

642
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Just...

643
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,433
Just take it off.

644
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Hey.

645
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,554
Ah.

646
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,233
It wasn't nice,
what you said about Miss Patricia.

647
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,673
You lied.

648
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,156
I'm sorry
about that, Hedwig.

649
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,551
You guys lied to me,
made me scared, etcetera.

650
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,037
Mr. Dennis, he says
you wear a lot of shirts.

651
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,593
I like this shirt.

652
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,714
Thank you.

653
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,594
Do you know who Dennis
and Miss Patricia are?

654
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,273
No.

655
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,755
Every one of us
has to wait in a chair,

656
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,672
and Barry, he decides
who stands in the light.

657
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,758
But Barry lost that power
because of me.

658
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,955
I can wish myself into the
light anytime I want.

659
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,955
It's a special power.

660
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,635
Barry just has to keep sitting
in his chair if I want him to.

661
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,477
That's why Dennis and Miss Patricia
said I could be with them.

662
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,030
Dennis and Miss Patricia,
they believe in The Beast

663
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,958
and what he can do.

664
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,794
Have you seen him?

665
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,799
The Beast?

666
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,151
No. Can I kiss you?

667
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,376
I wanted to kiss the other
girl with the dark hair,

668
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,992
but she's in trouble.

669
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,314
So, do you want to?

670
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,056
I mean, I don't know
much about kissing, though.

671
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,080
Yeah.

672
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,919
Okay.

673
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,908
Uh...

674
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,072
Okay, here we go.

675
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,589
One...

676
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,680
Two...

677
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,680
Three.

678
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,838
You might be pregnant now.

679
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,878
Am I a good kisser?

680
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,960
Yeah.

681
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,520
I like dancing.

682
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,517
Do you like dancing?

683
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,195
I like dancing to
my CD player in my room.

684
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,551
Kanye West
is my main man.

685
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,393
We got my CD player
set up in my room,

686
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,993
right next to my window.

687
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,800
I'm like...

688
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
We gots the moves.

689
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,240
Wow.

690
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,916
Maybe I could watch you dance

691
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,639
and listen to music with you.

692
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,990
No, my music's in my room.

693
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,232
Oh. Right.

694
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,760
Maybe

695
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,392
you could sneak me there.

696
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,791
Are you trying
to trick me?

697
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,913
Etcetera?

698
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,439
I'll tell on you.

699
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,148
I'm telling on you.

700
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,588
I'll tell you something.

701
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,590
And you can tell me
if I'm lying or not, okay?

702
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,830
Mmm-hmm.
Like a test. Okay?

703
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:17,115
I get into trouble
at school, on purpose.

704
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,874
So I can get sent
to detention.

705
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,069
To get away from everyone.

706
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,636
So that I can be alone.

707
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,277
Okay, I'll show you
something cool in my room.

708
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,388
Okay.

709
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,870
But after Mr. Dennis has finished
his getting-ready ritual.

710
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,833
I have to go.

711
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,433
He's got an appointment.

712
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,635
When I fall asleep,

713
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,456
one of the others keeps trying
to reach the doctor lady

714
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,629
to tell on us.

715
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,675
That pant,
it's got a red lining.

716
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,115
You can see it in
the long slit down the side.

717
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,994
We have been talking about
silk-and-wool blend for 20 minutes.

718
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,673
Can I guess that you emailed
me in the middle of the night

719
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:28,437
for an emergency session
due to garden-variety issues?

720
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,435
I was down and I emailed you and
I woke up and I feel better.

721
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,352
I feel better.

722
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,679
I had a thought.

723
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,040
Mmm-mmm.

724
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,634
I want to talk about
the incident at work.

725
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,633
It's okay, Barry.

726
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,989
You're safe.

727
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,948
I just want to bring
the details back.

728
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,156
We'll just talk
about the details.

729
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,749
A high school from
Camden, New Jersey

730
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,037
was on a field trip
at your place of work

731
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,475
and two young ladies
came up to you.

732
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,393
And one took your hand

733
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,437
and put it under her shirt
on her breast

734
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,720
and the second one
did the same

735
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,792
and then they just ran off
laughing to their friends.

736
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,554
You surmised that it
might be on a dare.

737
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,188
You said
they were 17 or 18.

738
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,237
You said
it upset you for days.

739
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,551
It was just a teenage prank.
I get that now.

740
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,233
And see,
that's my mistake.

741
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,552
I believe that I went over this
incident with you too fast.

742
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,754
Although you said
you were fine,

743
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,072
and the other identities
I met with said it was fine,

744
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:43,392
I believe that
this brought up issues

745
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,278
from when you were
a child and abused.

746
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,034
Sometimes another
incident of abuse

747
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,073
can cause suppressed
personalities to take the light.

748
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,598
Dennis, if this is you,

749
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,069
I completely understand

750
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,312
why you felt the need to take
over and protect the others.

751
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,435
Please!

752
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,118
Doctor, not this again.

753
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,508
The others told me

754
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:10,719
that you and Patricia told
the group about this Beast.

755
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,111
And I told them that these
are just scary stories

756
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,637
that Dennis and Patricia tell
the others to scare them.

757
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,234
How this Beast
can crawl on walls,

758
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,797
like the best rock climbers using the
slightest friction and imperfections

759
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,112
to hold his body close
to seemingly sheer surfaces.

760
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,396
How his skin is thick and tough
like the hide of a rhinoceros.

761
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:42,111
Do you really believe
the stories about The Beast?

762
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,800
Hmm.

763
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,070
If this is you, Dennis,

764
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,914
I understand
why Kevin needs you.

765
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,120
You are strong
and disciplined.

766
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,838
You are precise

767
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,594
and you will not be
taken advantage of.

768
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,152
You can trust me.

769
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,228
For example,

770
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:10,911
I do have the ability to use Kevin's
full name and bring him forward

771
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,479
as he has in the past.

772
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,998
But I wouldn't do that.

773
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,833
I know that that would
be chaos for all of you.

774
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,837
Everyone would
grab the light.

775
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,508
I don't want to hurt
any of you that way.

776
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,031
You don't have to hide.

777
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,272
I know you are someone
who cares for Kevin.

778
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,310
You are not evil to me.

779
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,035
You were necessary.

780
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,629
Dennis.

781
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,632
Is that you?

782
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,630
They keep calling us
The Horde.

783
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,718
The others, you know?

784
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,755
Miss Patricia and I,
we are ridiculed.

785
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,711
Now, we're not perfect,
but we don't deserve to be ridiculed.

786
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,357
We're all struggling.
They have to admit that.

787
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,513
I am pleased to
meet you, Dennis.

788
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,520
You, too.

789
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,071
I assume you don't know who emailed
me for the emergency sessions?

790
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,953
One of the others.

791
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,520
Are you in charge?

792
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,272
Yeah,
we've taken charge.

793
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,195
We're the only ones
that can protect Kevin.

794
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,351
We're all here
to protect Kevin.

795
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,599
He's very weak.

796
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,198
He doesn't know
how powerful we can be.

797
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,636
Would you mind telling me when
you first came into existence?

798
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,874
And how you and Patricia,
the other undesirable identity,

799
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,393
became aligned?

800
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,800
That's okay.

801
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,631
Do you still have
strong beliefs?

802
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,879
That depends on what.

803
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,790
This story of The Beast.

804
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,273
One thing, Dennis, that may
comfort you if you are confused

805
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,432
is that you've met
the other alters.

806
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,993
You're all in a room
in chairs, right?

807
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,079
Yeah.

808
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,152
But you never met
The Beast.

809
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,788
Because he doesn't reside
with the rest of you.

810
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,997
Because he resides in the train
yard, as the story goes,

811
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,435
because Kevin's dad
left on a train.

812
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,272
But the fact is,

813
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,513
you and Patricia have
never met The Beast.

814
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,160
Have you?

815
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,635
No.

816
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,750
That's because
he's not an alter.

817
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,189
He's not the 24th identity.

818
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,632
He's a fantasy.

819
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,757
Hurry up! Let's go!

820
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,231
Come on, it's time.

821
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,795
Wow.

822
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,589
I know.

823
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,993
This is your CD player?

824
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,309
Yeah.

825
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,039
You don't like it?

826
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,959
It's not new...
No!

827
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,312
No, I'm just, uh...

828
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,277
I'm confused.

829
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,199
You said
it was near a window.

830
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,873
Oh, that's here!

831
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,874
Watch.

832
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,359
Now, it's closed.

833
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,954
Now, it's open.

834
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,360
Now, it's closed.

835
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,353
Now, it's open.

836
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:57,033
Did you think
it was a real window?

837
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,231
So you could leave, etcetera?

838
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,036
Help me get out
of here, Hedwig.

839
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,035
Just get me the keys
and let me out the door.

840
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,760
Please.

841
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,314
Miss Patricia says that nobody
will make fun of me anymore

842
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,237
when The Beast comes!

843
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,675
She says that everyone
will see how amazing I am

844
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,116
and then all of the silly mistakes,
they won't matter anymore.

845
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,350
I think you should go
back to your room. No!

846
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,440
Wait, please,

847
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,039
I wanna hear
your Kanye West albums.

848
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,355
Show me your room.

849
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,715
Let's stay here.
I'm sorry I asked to leave.

850
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,199
I can't.

851
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,896
You said you wanted to show
me something cool, right?

852
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,955
No.

853
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,275
Show me something. Please!
I don't want to.

854
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,440
This!

855
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,719
Wow.

856
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,113
It's nice.

857
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,711
It's not a toy.

858
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,314
This is real?

859
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,480
Yes!

860
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,318
It's Mr. Dennis'.

861
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,836
He doesn't even know
I stole it.

862
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,829
Pretty cool, right?

863
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,959
You can listen
to people talking

864
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,110
and they don't even know
you're listening.

865
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,033
Who does this talk to?

866
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,519
Don't touch that.

867
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,552
I just wanna see
if it works.

868
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,758
Hey, what are you doing?

869
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,536
Don't touch those buttons.
You're gonna get us found out.

870
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,630
Yeah, East gate here.
What up?

871
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,959
Don't talk.

872
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,472
What up?
Don't talk.

873
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,600
Hello?

874
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,640
I'm gonna slap you!

875
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,795
Who's this?

876
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,709
Hello. Hello,
my name is Casey Cooke.

877
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,561
I'm being held in a basement.
I've been abducted with two other girls.

878
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,479
Who the hell is this?

879
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,319
Hello?

880
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,432
Casey Cooke.

881
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,709
I've been abducted.

882
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,836
You need to find me.

883
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,309
Betty, is that you?

884
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,909
This isn't funny.

885
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,435
Call the police.
I must be near you.

886
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,160
I'm being held
in a basement or something.

887
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,793
Okay, Betty, listen.

888
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,757
Tell Larry and Fish
I said hi.

889
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,070
Tell him I still got
his orange headphones.

890
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,271
I don't know where I am.

891
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,159
There's a man here.

892
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,754
He abducted us
and he's going to kill me.

893
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,835
I only have
a few hours left.

894
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,269
Please.

895
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,518
I'm begging you.

896
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,711
Somebody save us.

897
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,997
Wait, who is this?

898
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,879
And how did you get
one of our walkies?

899
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,234
Put your hands
together in contrition.

900
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,318
"In the sun,
we will find our passion.

901
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,836
"In the sun,

902
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,835
"we will find our purpose."

903
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,755
I read that on a sympathy
card in a supermarket.

904
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:55,034
It was for funerals,
but I thought it was beautiful.

905
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:04,193
Dennis will explain the
meaning of this evening.

906
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,639
The Beast is
a sentient creature

907
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:45,589
who represents the highest
form of humans' evolution.

908
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,799
He believes the time of
ordinary humanity is over.

909
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,109
I hope this makes you
feel calm.

910
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:01,038
You will be in the presence
of something greater.

911
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,634
I was gonna ask
for your last shirt,

912
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,119
but I won't.

913
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,110
Because tonight
is a sacred night.

914
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,312
It's almost over.

915
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,117
Casey. Come on.

916
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,396
Let's pretend
we're animals again.

917
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,909
Come on.

918
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,109
Casey, come on.
This is our game.

919
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,669
I'll tell your dad
you're not being nice.

920
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,553
Come on,
take off your stuff.

921
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,917
Animals don't
wear clothes.

922
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,275
Come on.

923
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,958
Yeah, yeah.

924
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,480
Come on.

925
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,398
Hey, Casey bear.

926
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,073
This isn't funny.

927
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,993
Is it loaded?

928
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,068
Casey.

929
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:48,955
I'm your uncle.

930
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,078
Stop it, Casey.

931
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,113
Put that gun down.

932
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,759
I'm getting upset.

933
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,918
I'm about to get very angry.

934
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,115
Give me the gun!

935
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,153
Could have killed me.

936
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,435
This place is closed. You can't get in.
No, it's okay.

937
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,953
No, it's okay.

938
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,839
Hello, Dennis.

939
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,916
One of the others
emailed me just now.

940
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,076
Is everything okay?

941
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,229
We're fine.

942
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,154
Dennis,

943
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,754
Kevin is really lucky
to have you.

944
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,354
You are quite extraordinary.

945
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,875
I just don't want
you guys to get hurt.

946
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,639
You think
we're extraordinary?

947
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,117
I like you, Dennis.

948
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,313
May I come in?

949
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,438
And can we talk?

950
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,033
I know you wanna
tell me something.

951
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,510
Why don't you just tell me?

952
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,796
We're very similar,
you and I.

953
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,030
Both on the outside,
looking in.

954
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,878
Please, sit.

955
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,994
I don't get many visitors.

956
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,038
Uh, I'll get you some water.

957
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,516
They got a proper
quarters for me

958
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,033
in a building
on the south side,

959
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,191
but we prefer it here.

960
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,176
When they promoted me
to head of maintenance,

961
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,633
they said I could have it.

962
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,996
Who are you
going to meet?

963
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,230
I wanna talk about

964
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,913
Kevin

965
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,270
and what his mother
did to him.

966
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,358
I remember it all.

967
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,879
I'm happy you're
suddenly so open.

968
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,715
Kevin's mother had
rather malevolent ways

969
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,836
of punishing
a three-year-old.

970
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,358
Is that when you arrived
in the light?

971
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,589
Yeah.

972
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,238
The one way to
avoid her attention

973
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,719
was to keep
everything spotless,

974
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,195
everything perfect.

975
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,068
I know you're coming from
good intentions, Dennis,

976
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,549
but there are other ways
to help Kevin now.

977
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,829
I've lost so many patients
into the system.

978
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,596
I want you to know, Dennis, I
will never stop fighting for you.

979
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,550
My patients have
become my family.

980
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,316
They are what I've chosen instead
of a more traditional path.

981
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,756
I hope you feel you can
be truly honest with me.

982
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,673
I actually wanna be
honest with you.

983
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,032
I lied before.

984
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,672
When you asked
if I'd ever met The Beast,

985
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,799
I said no.

986
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,157
That really isn't true.

987
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:18,069
You wrote about a woman in Germany
who'd been blind for 10 years.

988
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,077
And then, it was discovered
that she had DID.

989
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,149
Then three of her identities
developed sight.

990
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:31,197
And you speculated that her
optical nerves regenerated

991
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,960
because of her beliefs.

992
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,031
What are you
trying to say?

993
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,191
There are things,
Dr. Fletcher,

994
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,271
that all of us would
find hard to believe.

995
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,792
Are you trying to tell me
there's a 24th identity?

996
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,752
You protect the broken.

997
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,995
When you said that you thought
this situation was extraordinary,

998
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,515
I knew you can
maybe understand.

999
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,113
Understand what?

1000
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,474
The Beast

1001
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,752
is real.

1002
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,352
He's just emerged.

1003
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,954
You were right
about everything.

1004
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,598
What does he look like?

1005
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,789
He's much bigger than I am

1006
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,155
and I'm the biggest
of all of us.

1007
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,553
He's tall.

1008
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,790
He's very muscular.

1009
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,675
And he's got
a long mane of hair

1010
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:25,151
and his fingers are
twice the length of ours.

1011
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,509
He believes
we are extraordinary.

1012
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:34,151
That we don't represent a mistake,
but our potential.

1013
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,997
You say the same things.

1014
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,437
He's on the move.

1015
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,718
What does that mean?

1016
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,398
I don't understand.

1017
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,397
He can't be real.

1018
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,879
There must be limits to what
a human being can become.

1019
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,999
And there's another
whole part

1020
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,798
of the story, isn't there?

1021
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,517
About the eating
of the impure young?

1022
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,628
What does impure even mean?

1023
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:09,960
Well...

1024
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,314
We should discuss that

1025
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,391
so that you can
understand fully.

1026
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,073
Understand what?

1027
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,992
Sometimes,

1028
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,230
there's just no other way.

1029
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,675
Who are you going to meet?

1030
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,193
Him.

1031
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,520
You know what?

1032
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,069
I would love to take notes
on all of this.

1033
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,070
We should
probably discuss this

1034
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,758
in a proper session tomorrow.

1035
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,239
Really?

1036
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,913
You're okay with this?

1037
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,749
This has been so wonderful,
you being so open.

1038
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,115
I can see that
you feel very empowered

1039
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,918
by the philosophies
of The Beast.

1040
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,752
I'm going to go now.

1041
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,554
I knew you would understand.
I'll see you.

1042
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,031
Would you mind

1043
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,395
if I used your bathroom?

1044
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,235
No.

1045
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:26,594
It's down the hall,
near the stairs, on your left.

1046
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,433
How we doing?

1047
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,594
I'm okay.

1048
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,953
Are you real?

1049
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,034
Who is it?

1050
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,589
Help me.

1051
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,280
Help me.

1052
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,112
Is someone there?

1053
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,471
Please help me.

1054
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,110
They will never reach
their potential.

1055
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,554
They don't really matter.

1056
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,631
Listen to me, Dennis.

1057
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,794
I should've listened better.

1058
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,633
I should've understood
what you're capable of,

1059
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,392
how powerful you are.

1060
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,996
Patricia says your way
isn't working.

1061
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,952
The world
will understand now.

1062
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:56,399
Dennis, this is
an egregious wrong.

1063
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,071
These young women
are suffering.

1064
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,719
This is a crime.

1065
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,036
I can't let you
keep them here.

1066
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,918
We've gotta stop this.

1067
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,196
This identity is monstrous.

1068
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,157
I'm really sad
you feel this way.

1069
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,753
Can't you see?

1070
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,912
He is formed because of
your time in this place.

1071
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,679
There's a lady.

1072
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,318
Someone's here.

1073
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,030
We need to
get out of these rooms.

1074
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,793
Is there anything
in your room?

1075
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,960
Anything that we could use?

1076
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,197
There's nothing
in here.

1077
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,517
There's a hanger.

1078
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,878
Thank you, Dennis.

1079
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,913
Here you go, sir.

1080
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:00,279
It sounded like there were slide
bolts on the outside of our doors.

1081
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,113
See if you can move the lock
through the crack in the door.

1082
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,233
Stay calm.

1083
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,198
We're getting out of here.
We're gonna get Casey.

1084
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,431
You can do this, Marcia.

1085
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,878
With regard to
Chahamana's defeat

1086
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,632
and Muhammad of Ghor's
conquests

1087
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,234
between 1192 and 1200,

1088
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:06,635
I would liken it to
Muhammad's brazen ultimatum

1089
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,076
that Prithviraj
either apostatize or fight.

1090
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:14,758
Like Prithviraj's defiance,

1091
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,118
we should stand up
to The Horde's advances.

1092
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,355
In the face of their scare tactics,
we should show...

1093
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,717
I hate my insulin shots.

1094
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,836
No one else around here
has to take them.

1095
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,036
Why do I have to
have diabetes?

1096
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,634
All the doctors,
besides Dr. Fletcher,

1097
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,075
say that we're
the same person.

1098
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,756
Just personalities, huh?

1099
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,080
How do you explain
I'm the only one

1100
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,520
that needs these,
you motherfuck...

1101
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,389
I'm wearing cargo pants
from the '90s.

1102
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,151
And a scarf.

1103
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,595
If it wasn't for the Varvatos
T-shirt underneath,

1104
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,318
I'd be a mess.

1105
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,316
I got no taste
for things right now.

1106
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,670
I'm worried sick.

1107
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,758
I have a very bad feeling
that I'm losing time.

1108
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,993
I decide
who gets the light, right?

1109
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,513
I think

1110
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:17,036
someone is stealing the light
from me when I'm not aware.

1111
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,752
The Horde keeps obsessing about
the ones who haven't suffered.

1112
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,357
I don't know where they're going
with this, but it scares me.

1113
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,759
Picture yourself
in a couple hours at home.

1114
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,953
On the couch,

1115
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,508
in that ugly-ass sweatshirt
that you love.

1116
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,072
It's an animal!

1117
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,758
He goes like this if there's
a coyote or something.

1118
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,837
Kevin, Kevin.

1119
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,151
Thank you

1120
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,829
for helping us till now.

1121
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,514
I guess I should tell
Dr. Fletcher about this,

1122
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,439
but she'll worry.

1123
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,033
She's such a sweet woman.

1124
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,190
I believe I will go
for a nice walk

1125
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:30,515
and think this
through organizationally.

1126
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:37,632
Thus ends my journal
for Monday.

1127
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,800
Ciao.

1128
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,315
Claire.

1129
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,395
Marcia.

1130
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,235
Claire.

1131
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,434
Claire, let's go.

1132
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,271
"Kevin Wendell Crumb."

1133
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,111
Kevin Wendell Crumb?

1134
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,109
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1135
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:24,633
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

1136
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:37,391
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1137
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,388
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1138
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,957
You made a mess.

1139
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,678
Come out here.

1140
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,718
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

1141
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,518
You made a mess!

1142
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,908
Get out here!

1143
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,392
Who are you?

1144
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,598
What's happening?

1145
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,312
Something horrible.

1146
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:31,554
What'd I do?

1147
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,238
Did I hurt you?

1148
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,799
Dr. Fletcher.

1149
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,918
Dr. Fletcher.

1150
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,711
Who did that?

1151
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,113
You did.

1152
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,755
I swear, I was on a bus.

1153
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,715
I don't remember
anything after that. I...

1154
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:04,790
This is still
September 18, 2014, right?

1155
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,311
There's a shotgun I bought.

1156
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,394
It's in the bottom cabinet,
hidden behind things.

1157
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:24,791
The shells are in my uniform
closet out in the service hall.

1158
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:28,914
Kill me.

1159
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,919
Then kill me.

1160
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:41,400
Wait, no!

1161
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:42,754
Don't do that!

1162
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,598
He can't handle reality.

1163
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:46,120
My name is Jade.

1164
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:48,151
Has Dr. Fletcher been
getting our emails?

1165
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,799
This is what we have to do.

1166
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,831
As in 1008,

1167
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,629
when Anandapala suffered the
Shahis' most crushing defeat

1168
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,076
and Mahmud overran the
entirety of the Punjab region,

1169
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,879
taking the famed temple
of Kangra,

1170
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,918
we have been wronged
by this alliance,

1171
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,992
this horde of Patricia,
Dennis and the boy.

1172
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:12,192
Their actions
do not represent us.

1173
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,113
They are every...

1174
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:17,034
Everybody,
just take a minute!

1175
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,989
Oh, baby girl.

1176
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,160
They've been stealing control
of the light from me.

1177
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,760
But the group
are gonna work through this.

1178
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,110
Honey, my name is Barry.

1179
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,080
You shouldn't
have used the walkie-talkie.

1180
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,952
They almost caught us.

1181
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,119
Stop it, Hedwig!

1182
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,553
They were right.
Look at you.

1183
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,678
You're so frightened of us.

1184
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,510
Dennis and Miss Patricia
are in charge because of me.

1185
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,395
I'm gonna give the light
to them now.

1186
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:06,073
No one's allowed to
make fun of me anymore.

1187
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,675
Thank you, Hedwig.

1188
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,592
Everything's fine now.

1189
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,557
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1190
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:32,352
Kevin is asleep.

1191
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,431
We've made him sleep
far away.

1192
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,195
You can call his name
all you like, dear,

1193
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,350
but he's not
going to hear you.

1194
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,551
The Beast has
shared with us his dream

1195
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,757
of a larger group
to sustain him.

1196
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,234
No.

1197
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:52,234
Ten to 12 unworthy young
next time.

1198
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:56,394
This is just

1199
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,359
the start.

1200
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:19,395
Let go!

1201
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,192
Help!

1202
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,753
No! No!

1203
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:07,709
No.

1204
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,394
No.

1205
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,550
It runs in our family.

1206
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,755
My daddy died, too.

1207
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,353
Same way.

1208
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:31,238
Heart attack.

1209
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,432
But you don't need
to worry.

1210
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,192
I'm going to
take care of you.

1211
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,035
Now,

1212
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:45,953
you won't be giving me
any trouble, will you?

1213
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,870
I know you won't, sweetie.

1214
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,310
We are glorious!

1215
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:17,471
We will no longer be afraid.

1216
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:30,556
Only through pain

1217
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,149
can you achieve
your greatness!

1218
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:54,553
The impure
are the untouched,

1219
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:58,715
the unburned, the unslain.

1220
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:08,119
Those who have not been torn
have no value in themselves

1221
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:12,239
and no place in this world!

1222
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,915
They are asleep!

1223
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,080
Fuck!

1224
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:40,869
Your gun cannot hurt me.

1225
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,436
Can't you see
I am not human?

1226
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:51,155
Kevin is a man.
I am much more.

1227
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:26,479
You are different
from the rest.

1228
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:40,394
Your heart is pure!

1229
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,355
Rejoice!

1230
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:53,868
The broken
are the more evolved.

1231
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:02,713
Rejoice.

1232
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,794
What in the name
of Mary and Joseph?

1233
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:09,793
What are you doing
in this area?

1234
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,476
Just keep walking, honey.

1235
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,198
They won't do nothing.

1236
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:32,435
Vince, call the police.

1237
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:36,271
She said some people got hurt
in the area below maintenance.

1238
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,440
Okay.

1239
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:03,470
Now, I'm just gonna
check you.

1240
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:47,194
Third deceased name of Dr.
Karen Fletcher.

1241
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,749
Still trying to
locate the family.

1242
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,996
Casey Cooke's guardian's here.

1243
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:21,311
Your uncle's here.

1244
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,712
You ready to go?

1245
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,831
It didn't go through.

1246
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:24,879
We are
what we believe we are.

1247
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,516
Holy shit!

1248
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:35,434
This is so cool!

1249
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:41,359
They're gonna believe
we exist now, right?

1250
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,832
They're gonna have to.

1251
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,436
So what do we do now?

1252
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,559
We trust in him.

1253
01:50:58,200 --> 01:50:59,713
He'll protect us.

1254
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:04,755
Look at what he can do.

1255
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:10,354
Let him show the world
how powerful we can be.

1256
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,229
The suspected
murderer Kevin Crumb

1257
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:26,433
suffers from the controversial
psychological disorder DID.

1258
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:29,797
The rumors coming out of the
scene are almost unbelievable.

1259
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:33,794
There are conflicting stories
if the suspect is alive or dead

1260
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:36,474
after sustaining
two point-blank gunshots.

1261
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:39,438
Reports even indicate
one of his personalities

1262
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,750
is an amalgam of
the various animals

1263
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:43,950
in the Philadelphia Zoo
where he worked.

1264
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:46,953
The press is already referring
to the alleged attacker

1265
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:50,749
by a dark name leaked by
a source close to the case.

1266
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:54,071
Because of his many personalities,
he is being called

1267
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:55,229
The Horde.

1268
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:58,830
This is like that crazy
guy in the wheelchair

1269
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:00,956
that they put away
15 years ago.

1270
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:04,148
And they gave him
a funny name, too.

1271
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:06,638
What was it?

1272
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:08,594
Mr. Glass.

1273
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:09,909
Oh, yeah.

1274
01:52:10,305 --> 01:53:10,852
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
