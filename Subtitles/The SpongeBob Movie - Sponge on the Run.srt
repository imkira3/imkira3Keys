3
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,722
I'm ready!

4
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:11,982
The temperate, pristine,
shallow seas of the tropics.

5
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,486
A place of unparalleled beauty
and fecundity.

6
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:21,321
These islands play host
fo a vibrant ecosystem below.

7
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:25,533
A vast organism known
as the coral reef.

8
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:36,837
Life in this watery Metropolis
thrives among the twists and turns,

9
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,888
nooks and crannies and back alleys.

10
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,469
And near the reefs edge,
the varied and colorful terrain

11
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:51,810
gives way to a small town
by the name of bikini bottom.

12
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:58,069
Here, one can find
crustaceans...

13
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,527
Money!

14
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,283
Sea stars...

15
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,824
Octopil...

16
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,914
Various and diverse plankton...

17
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,501
The occasional
squirrel/scientist...

18
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,211
Good morning, Otto.

19
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,217
You're almost ready for the world!

20
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,344
Good morning. The machines will rise

21
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,517
to become masters
over all organic life!

22
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,146
And yes, the sea sponge.

23
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:35,444
This one lives happily
with his beloved pet snail, Gary.

24
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,656
Morning, Gary!

25
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,414
Snail trail. Yucky.

26
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,700
But oddly soothing.

27
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:56,131
Good morning, Patrick!

28
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,836
Good morning, spongebob!

29
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,423
Good morning, Patrick!

30
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,352
Good morning, spongebob!

31
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,022
Good morning, Patrick!

32
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,398
Good morning, spongebob!

33
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,979
Good morning, Patrick!

34
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,532
Would you two knuckleheads
keep it down out there?

35
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,077
- Good morning, squidward!
- Good morning, squidward!

36
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,534
Come on, Gary! Breakfast!

37
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,296
You're welcome.

38
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,595
Who wants a belly scratch?

39
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,927
I love you so much, Gary.

40
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,601
What's this?

41
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,442
Okay, that'll come out later.

42
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,817
Living like I'm on the edge
of surreality

43
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,196
good morning, spongebob.

44
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,450
But I know everything is gonna be cool

45
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,078
as long as you're here with me

46
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,829
we're gonna lighten up
each other's load

47
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,336
when bumps and curves come on the road

48
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,885
'cause we are all in it together

49
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,133
and that's forever

50
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:31,344
it's always summer in bikini bottom

51
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,763
and in December

52
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,100
we're singing la-di-da-da

53
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:42,655
it's always summer in bikini

54
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,029
in bikini bottom
it's always summer

55
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,780
it doesn't get better than that

56
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,078
money!

57
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,957
I'm late if I'm gonna be early.

58
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,709
Don't worry, gare-bear.

59
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,461
I'll be back before you can say,

60
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,917
"why did he cruelly
abandon me like that?"

61
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,525
Another day, another migraine.

62
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,942
At least I'll get a little peace
and quiet before that little...

63
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,398
Good morning, squidward!

64
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,279
And isn't it a lovely morning?

65
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,577
Nope. Not talking to you.

66
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,906
I'm especially not getting involved
in any of your nonsense today.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,412
I always end up
with the wrong end of the stick.

68
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,125
Okay, squidward.

69
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,083
But you should know

70
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,881
that old gertrude's getting
pretty finicky these days.

71
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,005
Old gertrude? Who the kelp is that?

72
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,216
You've worked with her for years!

73
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,013
She's the eight-burner grill
in the kitchen.

74
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,971
It never ends.

75
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,557
Anyway, to fire her up,

76
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,560
you've got to spark
her flints manually and then

77
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,767
jiggle her gas jets just a little.

78
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,148
And then read
her favorite story:

79
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,480
"The little griddle who could."

80
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:07,781
"Chapter two."

81
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,280
"But we are fresh from
the freezer, ' said the patties,

82
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,452
"and we're cold.™

83
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,326
"don't worry,
I'll get you nice and warm, '

84
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,657
"said the little griddle."

85
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,242
What'd I just say?
I am not interested.

86
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,747
Don't involve me!

87
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,175
What'd you say, squidward? Squidward?

88
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,423
Okay, squidward, doesn't matter.
I'll always be here anyway.

89
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,633
Unfortunately.

90
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,427
Stop yer loafing, Mr. squidward!

91
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,558
There's work
to be done around here!

92
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,014
Attention, krusty crew!

93
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,691
All hands on deck,
front and center!

94
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,314
Aye-aye, cap'n krabs, sir!

95
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:50,320
Now, who's ready to set sail on
another adventure of making me money?

96
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,529
- Get moving, sailor!
- Sir, yes, sir!

97
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,989
Raise the colors!

98
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,710
Hoist the mainsail!

99
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,004
Deploy smokestacks!

100
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,061
Never gets old.

101
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:36,407
Enjoy it while you can,
Mr. Eugene krabs.

102
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,041
What the...

103
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,042
Stupid machine!

104
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,744
Where was I? Yeah.

105
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,884
Tonight I launch
evil plan number 3,087

106
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:56,307
and finally take possession
of the krabby Patty secret formula!

107
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,634
Great. Another evil plan.

108
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,559
What's wrong with another evil plan?

109
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,390
Nothing, it's just we're running
out of room on the wall of failure.

110
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,020
Wall of fai...

111
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,110
Karen, why do you keep
collecting these?

112
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,440
Memories.

113
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,448
Well, tonight is gonna be different.

114
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,455
You see, Karen, my computer wife,

115
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,703
every time I've tried
to steal that formula,

116
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,625
krabs has tried to thwart me.

117
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,870
Not Mr. krabs.

118
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,206
But tonight, that all... what?

119
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,963
It's not Mr. krabs, sweetheart.
I've checked the data.

120
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,635
It's spongebob
who's the problem.

121
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:35,723
Hello.

122
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,922
Fish sticks.

123
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,633
What could that boob
have to do with it?

124
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,434
Boob savant, you mean.

125
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,103
Spongebob is the one
who keeps foiling your plans,

126
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,555
- not Mr. krabs.
- Surprise!

127
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,359
Nonsense.

128
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,151
It's krabs, Karen, I know it is.

129
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:56,283
And tonight,
I will finally extract my revenge!

130
00:08:58,955 --> 00:08:59,955
Will you be late?

131
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,531
You can't put a clock
on genius, Karen.

132
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,584
Order up! Move it, let's go!

133
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,832
Aye-aye, chef!

134
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,258
One for you.
Enjoy your krabby Patty. Enjoy!

135
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,009
Order up!

136
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,587
Come on, spongebob!

137
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,924
- Coming, fry cook spongebob!
- Coming, fry cook spongebob!

138
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,650
Hiya, spongebob!

139
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,142
Hi, Sandy!

140
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,857
Did you know that, in the future,
everything will be automated?

141
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,657
Really? Even stomachaches?

142
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,870
I'm gonna see
if Mr. krabs wants to be

143
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,288
an early adopter
of my new technology.

144
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,535
Wait, what?

145
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,243
You're gonna replace me
with a robot? Don't do it!

146
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,750
No, silly, that's gonna happen anyway.

147
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,003
This is something much more
innovative and start-uppy.

148
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,130
You have 60 seconds.

149
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,257
Its name is Otto!

150
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,551
My name is Otto.

151
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,258
How may I serve you?

152
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,390
It's an automated restaurant owner.

153
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:08,684
Automated?

154
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,515
Sounds expensive. Not interested.

155
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,191
Otto doesn't require a salary.

156
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,236
And it can make cold,
heartless decisions

157
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,315
like firing people,
because it doesn't have a heart.

158
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,899
You don't say.

159
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,326
- You're fired.
- Amazing!

160
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,325
I love money.

161
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,078
A cold, unfeeling mechanical robot

162
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,081
after me own cold,
unfeeling crustacean heart.

163
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,912
I'll take it and nurture it

164
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,749
and I will love Otto
like he was me own son.

165
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,879
Thank you, daddy.

166
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,586
Yippee! You're not
gonna regret this, Mr. krabs.

167
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,255
You're fired.

168
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,510
I could listen to that all day.

169
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,601
No, seriously.

170
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,224
We decided to go
in a different direction.

171
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,679
You're fired.

172
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,234
What?

173
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,479
Don't make me call security.

174
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,061
- You're fired.
- No, yer fired!

175
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,239
- No, you're fired.
- Yer fired, ye infernal machine!

176
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,111
I'm not fired, you're fired.

177
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,405
Robot abuse.

178
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,085
You're fired.

179
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,626
What the heck is this thing?

180
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,884
I don't know, but I'm taking it home.
It's so cute.

181
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,009
What?

182
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,842
Come on, little robot.
Let's get you some supper.

183
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,427
- Not even funny, Karen.
- Quiet, plankton.

184
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,183
- Don't listen to him.
- Karen!

185
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,639
I love you, mom.

186
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,532
Spongebob! Be sure this
kitchen's in shipshape shape

187
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,859
before ye head out, boy.

188
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,285
Oui, oui, monsieur boss man krabs.

189
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,081
Once I am done here, zees kitchen
shall be completely spotless.

190
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,045
Whatever.

191
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,378
I found this uneaten
krabby Patty on table six.

192
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,751
You know what to do with it.

193
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,207
Right away, Mr. ki!

194
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,883
I'll see that
it's disposed of properly.

195
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,635
Who said anything about disposing of?

196
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,213
We'll sell it again tomorrow,

197
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,471
on our legacy
artisanal vintage throwback menu.

198
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,722
Good night!

199
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,188
I better start cleaning.

200
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,362
I'm ready!

201
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,253
Well, good night, gertrude!

202
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,422
Good night, fryer.
Good night, Patty.

203
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,749
Good night, pickles.

204
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,229
Good night, spongebob.

205
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,227
Hello, krabby Patty!

206
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,569
And now...

207
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,127
Just got to get it.

208
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,378
Yes!

209
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,761
Wait. No!

210
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,635
Stupid coin-operated...

211
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,552
Come here...

212
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,478
Bingo!

213
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,606
Come to papa.

214
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,822
In just a few minutes,
the formula will be mine!

215
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:06,418
Yes! Krabs's fast-food empire will
fail and I will rule bikini bottom,

216
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,548
as its new slop king!

217
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,726
I knew it!

218
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,232
The formula!

219
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,980
I knew I left my keys in here.

220
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,402
Silly me.

221
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,820
Come here, you!

222
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,071
No keys. That's weird.
Where could they be?

223
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,527
Yes! No.

224
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,370
Keys, where are you?

225
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,622
Come on, show me keys!

226
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,921
Gotchal

227
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,461
no!

228
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,014
They were in my pocket
the whole time!

229
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,976
It's spongebob who's the problem.

230
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,099
I get it.

231
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,692
Meanwhile, at the palace
of king Poseidon...

232
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,570
Ruler of the seven seas.

233
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,199
Chancellor!

234
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,703
Chancellor!

235
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,910
Chancellor!

236
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,790
Yo. What's up, sire?
You sent for me?

237
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,000
Chancellor, look. Look at me!

238
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,302
3,000 years old
and check out my skin.

239
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,551
It's like a baby's butt.

240
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,974
Ageless, sire. Looking fresh.

241
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:41,350
I owe it to my subjects
to look fabulous, don't you think?

242
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,648
There are other obligations, sire.

243
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,476
Like ruling and stuff. Let's see.

244
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,313
I need your signature
on these taxes, decrees,

245
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,820
this here declaration of war
and my paycheck.

246
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,491
Is that right? Yeah.

247
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,788
Very good.

248
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,622
When will you learn to focus
on what really matters?

249
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:08,173
A monarch's regime is only as powerful
as his skin care regime.

250
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,669
Word.

251
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,593
You know, some say I have a face
like a Greek god.

252
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,137
Well, you are a Greek god, so...

253
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,225
Wait, is...

254
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,050
Is that a wrinkle? “Where?

255
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,181
It is! It's a wrinkle!

256
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:25,390
I look like an old avocado that's been
left and forgotten in the fridge!

257
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,520
Here it comes.

258
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,852
I'm ugly!

259
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,615
Now, where is it?

260
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,114
The crawly thing
with the round shell and the eyes.

261
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,320
Where is it?

262
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,073
Here you go, sire. Your royal snail.

263
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,829
Thank you.

264
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,254
This mollusk has the rejuvenating
power of a thousand facials.

265
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,843
What? Is it empty?

266
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,471
Take it away!

267
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,299
Bring me another sea snail at once!

268
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,726
- Chancellor!
- Okay.

269
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,900
Full disclosure, man.
We're out of snails.

270
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,318
What?

271
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,818
In fact, the entire
snail population has been...

272
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,366
What's the word? Yeah. Depleted.

273
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,739
You're telling me there are

274
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,821
- n0 more snails?
- There are no more snails.

275
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,282
- And you're confident of that?
- Relatively confident.

276
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,835
Chancellor, for the love of hermes,
my kingdom for a snail!

277
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,382
No. I'm being hasty.

278
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,427
Half my kingdom for a snail!

279
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,095
No, a boon. Yes.

280
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,889
I'll Grant a boon to whomever
shall bring me a snail.

281
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,639
Gotcha.
I'll draw up the decree, sire.

282
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,103
A royal decree from king Poseidon?

283
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,529
"To all citizens of the sea,

284
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,948
"the king requires a snail at once,

285
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,493
"blah blah blah
skin care blah blah..."

286
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,866
Wait a minute.

287
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,247
A snail?

288
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,076
No, it's too perfect.

289
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,456
Get rid of Gary, get rid of spongebob.

290
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,792
Oh, yeah.

291
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,762
Gary, I'm home!

292
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,355
Gare-bear?
Hey, where are you, buddy?

293
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,149
Gary?

294
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,152
Gary?

295
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,734
You must be in the... no.

296
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,408
Gary?

297
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,911
Gary? Gary, Gary, Gary! Gary!

298
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,492
Gary! Where's Gary?

299
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:53,421
Gary!

300
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:08,015
Gary, where are you?

301
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,650
Gary.

302
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,740
I loved you
since the first day we met.

303
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,552
Hello, little snail.

304
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,105
What's your name?

305
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,153
"Gary," huh?

306
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,909
Well, hi, Gary.

307
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,536
Gary, do you want to be friends?

308
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,168
Me, too.

309
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,339
Spongebob!

310
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,930
Hey, spongebob!
I found this flyer.

311
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,511
Gary's missing!

312
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,855
I know, Patrick.

313
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,734
Spongebob?

314
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:42,609
Patrick, if something
were to happen to Gary, I, well...

315
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,282
I don't know what I'd do.

316
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,367
I'm sorry, buddy.

317
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,537
Hey! Maybe he left a clue.

318
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,536
Look! A clue!

319
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,215
Gary's been snailnapped!

320
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:05,215
And taken
to the lost city of Atlantic city!

321
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,380
Really?

322
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,681
That's awesome!

323
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,468
Now we know where he is.

324
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,474
Not really that awesome, Patrick.

325
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,568
Listen to this.

326
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:22,611
"Made famous by the glitzy
palace Poseidon calls home,

327
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,781
"the lost city
of Atlantic city is a scary,

328
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:29,281
"vice-ridden cesspool
of moral depravity."

329
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,701
All that, and it's lost, too?

330
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:36,580
"King Poseidon has proven
himself a whimsical tyrant,

331
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,128
"known for executing his subjects
by beheading them

332
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,798
"in a flamboyant floor
show extravaganza."

333
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,918
"Our advice for those
travelling here is...

334
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,007
"Don't."

335
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,304
This king Poseidon
sounds like a tough customer.

336
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,180
Yeah. Tough.

337
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,062
So what? This is about friends.

338
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:01,188
And friends don't let friends
become somebody else's face cream!

339
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,438
Not what friends do.

340
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,612
So what if it's dangerous and scary?

341
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,778
So what!

342
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:10,701
What is stopping me right now
from going there, rescuing Gary

343
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,621
and standing up to this king Poseidon?

344
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,914
- I don't know!
- Well, I do!

345
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,457
What is it? Ll.

346
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,495
Don't have the courage.

347
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,586
Gary.

348
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,796
Tartar sauce!

349
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,802
What's the next best thing to courage?

350
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,426
- Resolve?
- No.

351
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,931
- Fortitude?
- Nah.

352
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,353
- Commitment?
- Nope.

353
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,772
- Wherewithal? Bravery?
- No.

354
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,521
Valor. Grit? “What? No.

355
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,602
- Heroism? Gallantry?
- Nah.

356
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,484
- Moxie.
- A buddy! A wingman!

357
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,985
A wingman?

358
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,782
A friend.

359
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,202
Really, Patrick? You'd go with me?

360
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,905
Yeah, right behind you!

361
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,582
Do I smell a road trip?

362
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,997
That could be my breath.

363
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,585
Okey-dokey.

364
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,291
Now, let's drill down on a plan.

365
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,001
Pat, you're in charge of transpo.

366
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,508
Just remember, I don't drive
and you don't have a car.

367
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,101
Beep, beep!

368
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,815
Hey, boys!

369
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,198
Don't know if you have any use
for this old thing,

370
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,120
if you're going
on any trips or journeys

371
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,664
or quests or rescue missions.

372
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,789
But if you are, Otto is your ticket.

373
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,495
- Otto!
- Otto!

374
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,583
Just tell ol' Otto where you want
to go and it will take you there!

375
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,133
All aboard.

376
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,460
- You're fired.
- Cool!

377
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,095
A self-driving boat.

378
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,094
Thanks, plankton. You're the best!

379
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,471
I know. Bye-bye.

380
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,804
- Otto. Find Gary.
- You got it.

381
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,441
No, Patrick.
You got to be more specific.

382
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,490
Otto, find Gary the snail.

383
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,783
Recalculating.

384
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,122
Here, let me try.

385
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,292
Take them
to the lost city of Atlantic city

386
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,744
and don't ever come back!

387
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,672
Never hurts to employ
a little hyperbole.

388
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,171
It is my pleasure to serve you.

389
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,053
Bon voyage, boys.

390
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,230
I'm ready. They're dead.

391
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:58,323
This is gonna be like
one of those buddy movies.

392
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,414
We're the buddies!

393
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,410
Not sure
that really applies, Patrick, but...

394
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,661
Why not?

395
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,869
We're two dudes setting out
with a common goal.

396
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,956
We'll argue about something dumb,
fight and break up.

397
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,132
Only to come back together
when we realize

398
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,631
neither could do it without the other.

399
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,134
It's simple yet magical.

400
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,259
Yeah.

401
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,222
It feels more to me like
the journey of a singular hero,

402
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,099
who against all odds,
triumphs over adversity.

403
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,727
I say buddy movie

404
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,651
and you say whatever
that dumb thing was you just said.

405
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,569
Really? Dumb thing? I'm dumb?

406
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,442
I love your sense of irony, Patrick.

407
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,445
Thank you.
I love my sense of ironing, too.

408
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,448
Maybe if your head
wasn't packed full of sand,

409
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,574
you could have ironing!

410
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,908
Well, better a head full of sand
than a head full of rocks, like yours!

411
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,368
That's it! Stop the car!

412
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,920
Yeah, stop the car, Otto!

413
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,393
Sorry, Patrick. Really.

414
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,812
I shouldn't have said
you have rocks in your head.

415
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,767
I shouldn't have said
your brain was made of sand.

416
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,898
That was mean and dumb.

417
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,071
Okay. Let's just forget it.

418
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,614
Never happened!

419
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,034
Hop on in, guys.

420
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,670
Come on, guys.

421
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,049
Nope.

422
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,343
Krabby! Yeah!

423
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,145
One at a time, people. One at a time.

424
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,773
Squidward, why ain't I seeing
krabby patties

425
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,046
rolling out the service window?

426
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,527
- Where's spongebob?
- How should I know?

427
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,855
And, frankly,
you won't find me complaining.

428
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,942
Spongebob!
What's with yer lollygaggin' boy?

429
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,989
Spongebob?

430
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,326
Spongebob?

431
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:11,035
Get out here this instant!
That's a direct order!

432
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,206
I don't get it.
He has never missed a workday.

433
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,801
Krabby Patty! Krabby Patty!

434
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,345
Hey! Where are my krabby patties?

435
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,924
- How should I know?
- It's coming, sir, it's coming!

436
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,761
Squidward, get in that kitchen
and whip up some krabby patties.

437
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,266
All right, gertrude.
Now, what did he say?

438
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,854
Spark her flints.

439
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,861
Jiggle her jets. And, yes!

440
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,444
"The little griddle who could."

441
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,077
"We're fresh from the freezer,
said the little..."

442
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,997
- Mr. krabs, we've got a...
- Squidward!

443
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,163
Save yourself!

444
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,584
We wouldn't be in this mess
if spongebob was around.

445
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,761
Where is spongebob?

446
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,322
Where are we?

447
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,240
We must be dreaming!

448
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,118
You amuse me, spongebob.

449
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,618
Two people can't have the same dream,

450
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,745
let alone be
in that same dream at the same time.

451
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,418
That would be
philosophically untenable.

452
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,338
Indeed. You proffer
a metaphysical conundrum.

453
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,007
Wait, we're talking like smart people.

454
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,709
This must be a dream!

455
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,325
Plus, we're on the surface
and we're...

456
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:46,766
Breathing air, so...

457
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,885
Yeah!

458
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,426
Air?

459
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,266
Hey, town up ahead!

460
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,858
"Goner gulch."
That's a funny name.

461
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,122
"The inferno saloon."

462
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,426
"Ye who enter here
abandon all hope."

463
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,426
Guess that's another way
of saying "no public restrooms."

464
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,811
Hello?

465
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,396
- Otto, keep it close.
- Yeah, don't go anywhere.

466
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,727
Go anywhere.

467
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,356
It is my pleasure to serve.
You're fired.

468
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,404
How are we gonna find Gary now?

469
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,201
Maybe Otto just went to park.

470
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:06,929
Hello.

471
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:08,723
Who are you?

472
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,391
I am a simple tumbleweed.
Call me Sage.

473
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,809
- Sage.
- Hey, Sage. Good name.

474
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,309
Thanks. I'm made
out of Sage, and I am a Sage.

475
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,936
So it works out pretty well.

476
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,025
I'm Patrick!

477
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,899
My name means toaster in Celtic.

478
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,775
Pretty sure it doesn't.

479
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:32,031
This dream you share
has a hidden purpose, young seekers.

480
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,828
So we are in a dream!

481
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:37,871
And I, friend, am the dream Weaver.

482
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,374
Oh, dream Weaver...

483
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,208
Are you inside our minds right now?

484
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,588
Yes, Patrick.

485
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,763
I am here to help you
on your journey, spongebob.

486
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,557
But first,
you must accept a challenge.

487
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:58,307
But, I just want to find Gary
and bring him home.

488
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,856
- Do you love Gary?
- More than anything!

489
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,810
And, young sponge,
once you meet this challenge

490
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,521
you may pass on
to find your precious Gary.

491
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,073
- Got it. Right. That makes sense.
- Right, that makes sense.

492
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,737
Take this challenge coin.

493
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,073
- Challenge coin!
- Challenge coin!

494
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,376
It will give you courage
when bravery is in short supply.

495
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,463
Cool!

496
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,131
Now, your challenge lies behind
these saloon doors.

497
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,879
Let's go! Come on, Patrick.
Wait.

498
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,280
- Let's kill this challenge.
- Wait, guys!

499
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,669
Challenge coin coming through!

500
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,675
I didn't give you your challenge!

501
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,724
Patience, Sage. Patience.

502
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:50,356
Cool. One of those old player pianos.

503
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,737
Or one of those old piano players!

504
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,881
- Scary people!
- Scary people!

505
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:11,051
Flesh-eating cowboy
pirate zombies, to be precise.

506
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:14,050
Flesh-eating cowboy pirate zombies?

507
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,927
This is your challenge.

508
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,303
Free these zombies
from their earthly binds

509
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,101
and release their souls.

510
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,725
If this weren't a dream,
I'd be freaking out right now!

511
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,022
Yeah!

512
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,357
We are in a dream.

513
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,816
Okay, everyone!

514
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,772
We're here to release
your imprisoned souls.

515
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,659
What was that?

516
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:39,075
El diablo the wicked approaches.

517
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:43,079
El diablo El! Diablo

518
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,458
El diablo El! Diablo

519
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,914
very bad man

520
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,465
El diablo?

521
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,884
Master of this zombie crew.

522
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,461
He sounds bad.

523
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,636
Good luck.

524
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,889
Patrick, the zombies are swarming!

525
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,104
They're gonna eat our brains!

526
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,486
Dance!

527
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,406
Dance!

528
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,738
Boss dogg

529
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,615
even when I'm on I'm off, y'all

530
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,617
lookin' for the king
it'll cost y'all

531
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,289
you better leave now
are you lost, dawg?

532
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,367
The zombie king
yeah, I hear him coming

533
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,498
og ghoul with a thirst for the run-in

534
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,733
you in the wrong bar wrong town

535
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:29,837
got a spot to fill

536
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,461
the real deal coming down that hill

537
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,469
your brains for breakfast

538
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,089
soul on the menu major checklist

539
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,262
ghouls, goblins guard the exit

540
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,305
the fire in his eyes
ain't hard to catch it

541
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,054
El diablo, the haunting
taunting veterano

542
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,180
it's scary, I know

543
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,977
the goner gulch
where the drama is

544
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,851
but don't hate the game
we in the zombie biz

545
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,649
we feel the love - yes, sir

546
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,227
- when we all dance together
- What? What? What?

547
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,402
Together

548
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,824
we made it, made it
our whole life long

549
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,572
we won't stop

550
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,863
El diablo is here!

551
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,698
- Dance!
- We the baddest crew

552
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,749
- hands high!
- What's eating you?

553
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,792
- Us!
- We comin' through

554
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,166
killing it is how we do!

555
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,466
El diablo's on his way
smell the odor of decay

556
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,760
dance, we came to slay

557
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,178
'cause killing it is how we do!

558
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:26,891
What did I tell you about
dancing when I'm not here?

559
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,974
But, boss, it's freestyle Friday!

560
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,070
Okay, my bad.

561
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,234
Hey. Yo, spongebob? I got to dip.

562
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,152
Y'all got this.

563
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,905
Bring the prisoners to my office.

564
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,529
What'd that guy mean by prisoners?

565
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:00,178
So, you dare to enter
the ghost town of the damned,

566
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,885
barge into my demon's lair...

567
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,550
Telling my zombies...

568
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,219
That you're gonna
free their souls...

569
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,348
Likke it ain't no thing!

570
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,611
Well, Mr. diablo,
the good thing is we're in a dream.

571
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,359
- A shared dream.
- Right, a shared dream.

572
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,533
So there's no need to get
all bent out of shape about it.

573
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,781
It's not real!
"Cause it's a dream.

574
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,205
Who told you that?
That crazy bush guy?

575
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,915
Maybe.

576
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,291
What he should've told you
was it's not a dream!

577
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,751
He might be right, Patrick.
That felt pretty real.

578
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,631
Yeah, that really hurt.

579
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,223
Run!

580
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,522
Hang on, Patrick.

581
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,975
Foul demon, be gone!

582
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,945
What the heck is that?

583
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,191
What do I look like,
a parking meter?

584
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,072
But Sage said...

585
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,028
Coin laundry's right down the street.

586
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,740
That's pathetic!

587
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,792
Get away from those curtains!

588
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,841
- What? These curtains?
- These are nice curtains.

589
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,919
They are. So soft.

590
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,463
That's weird.

591
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,424
These curtains are making
a strange sound.

592
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,390
I think the curtain rod
needs some oil.

593
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,055
Once the rod goes,
you're probably better off

594
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,640
getting a whole new set of curtains.

595
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,771
Mr. diablo, do you have
any other cur...

596
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,857
Patrick, I think
we should get out of here!

597
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,249
Hey, everybody!

598
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,041
El diablo says
he doesn't want to be disturbed.

599
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,335
Yeah, he's feeling a little burnt...

600
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,246
- Out.
- Toodle-00!

601
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,547
- Buh-bye!
- See you!

602
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,634
Take care!

603
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,334
Thank ye, spongebob.

604
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,670
We're finally free!

605
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,388
Adios, mateys!

606
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,466
We're finally free.

607
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,677
Good luck on your journey, boys.

608
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,102
Do you know what this means?

609
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,028
We passed the challenge!

610
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,526
Now we can find Gary!

611
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:33,657
El diablo El! Diablo

612
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,913
Otto!

613
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,495
Howdy, partners.

614
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,085
Wait! Can't forget the courage.

615
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,926
It's him!

616
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,254
- Yikes!
- Come on, Otto. Let's go!

617
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,423
Come on, come on, Otto!

618
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,134
- Step on it, Otto! Go! Go!
- Faster! Go faster!

619
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,969
Go, Otto, go!

620
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,808
Very bad man

621
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,026
faster!

622
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,317
- Wake up. Your dream is fired.
- Otto!

623
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,564
Faster.

624
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,031
We're back on the bottom.

625
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,234
See, Patrick?
It must have been a dream.

626
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,445
More of a vision really.

627
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,452
- Sage?
- Hi, Sage.

628
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,249
- Hello.
- You are real.

629
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,704
As real as your desire
to see that which you cannot.

630
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,757
Yeah, well, that which
I cannot see is Gary.

631
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,422
I got to know what's happening.

632
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,504
This wish I Grant you.

633
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,592
Through the mystical fabric
of the fourth dimension,

634
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,426
you may now view what's happening

635
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,309
at the same time as things
are happening to you.

636
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,357
Behold. The window of meanwhile.

637
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,398
The window of meanwhile!

638
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,237
What's it do?

639
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,987
It's like the video on demand
service of parallel action.

640
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,411
Have a look.

641
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,154
Hey, Patrick. Down in front.

642
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,667
Look, Patrick, there he is!

643
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,415
Yeah, he looks all right.

644
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,506
Hey, Gary!

645
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,582
- He doesn't look so bad.
- He looks pretty comfy!

646
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,043
No reason to panic. Yeah!

647
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,615
He looks like he's well taken care of.

648
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,880
Look what I found. Snail time.

649
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,761
Hello, precious.

650
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,183
Gary?

651
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,263
I hope you don't run out of juice,
or you'll end up like the others.

652
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,357
What?

653
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,657
Yes.

654
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,364
- Gary! Gary, hello?
- Gary!

655
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,701
Okay, the window of meanwhile
doesn't really work that way.

656
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,458
- Gary, run! Get out of there!
- Gary!

657
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:48,133
It's not a video chat app
like Skype or facetime, or anything.

658
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,756
- We got to hurry! Gary!
- Over here! Gary!

659
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,554
- Gary! We got you, Gary.
- Totally can't hear you.

660
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,676
Hello!

661
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,022
Hello, Eugene, old friend!

662
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,648
How's business?

663
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,069
Bad? Good.

664
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,861
Well, that's restaurants
for you, huh? Feast or famine.

665
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,238
But I digress.

666
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:22,542
Why don't you be a good little loser
and hand over the secret formula?

667
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,505
Take it. It's yours.

668
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,136
Wha...

669
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,768
Take it all.

670
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,190
Wait...

671
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,398
You're giving up?

672
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:49,979
Plankton,
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

673
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:54,863
But somehow, without spongebob,
this whole thing...

674
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,656
Just doesn't make sense anymore!

675
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,536
You can't do that.

676
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,243
I've spent my entire career
waiting for this moment

677
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,750
and you roll over
like a harpooned whale?

678
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,206
I won't let you Rob me
of my vengeance!

679
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,002
Give my regards to your lovely wife.

680
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,389
This doesn't...

681
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,013
Feel quite as good as...

682
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,652
I won.

683
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:35,024
Congratulations.
You have arrived at your destination.

684
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,825
The lost city of Atlantic city!

685
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,948
It's pretty.

686
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,749
Beware, young seekers.

687
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:47,869
All 1s distortion.

688
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,956
If you aren't careful,
the lost city will draw you

689
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,168
into her fickle embrace, blind you
with her dazzling distractions

690
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,096
and tempt you
with her fleeting games of chance.

691
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,015
Whatever you do, don't be led astray,

692
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:06,142
don't lose focus
and don't forget why you came here.

693
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,671
- Don't forget. Good one.
- Thanks, Sage-meister.

694
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,526
- I think we got this.
- Yeah, Sage.

695
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,478
I mean,
you've been pretty good up until now,

696
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:19,819
but I love Gary
more than anything in the whole world!

697
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,448
And we came here to get him back.

698
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,539
Okay.

699
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,205
I wouldn't worry
about us losing any focus.

700
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,499
Oh, boy.

701
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,122
We got focus to burn, baby.

702
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,467
- Cotton candy!
- Ice cream!

703
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,841
Churros!

704
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,943
What's up?

705
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,914
Isn't it cool how they let you
trade in your real money

706
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,457
for these little plastic circles?

707
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,875
I love money!

708
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,954
Casinos are magical.

709
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,914
Would you mind
if I put this down, sir?

710
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,070
Place it wherever you like.

711
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,254
Just putiton I.

712
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,176
Patrick, that's not an I,
that's a seven.

713
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,595
Seven starts with an I? That's weird.

714
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,563
Seven!

715
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,597
More plastic circles!

716
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,893
- Who are you guys?
- We're your entourage.

717
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,771
Upside, inside out

718
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,402
she's livin' la vida loca

719
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,406
place your bets.

720
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:46,745
Come on, seven!

721
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,416
Lucky seven! Winner!

722
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:59,216
Living la vida loca!

723
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,919
Seven!

724
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:05,051
Seven.

725
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,434
- Hey, Patrick!
- What's up, spongey-dawg?

726
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,019
- I lost all my money.
- Me too!

727
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,988
Party people!

728
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,318
Where is everybody?

729
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,164
I feel like I swallowed a sea urchin.

730
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,457
Me too.

731
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,411
Hey, I did swallow a sea urchin!

732
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,329
Well, well, well.

733
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,716
Sagester! Good to see ya, pal!

734
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,633
Nice work, boys.

735
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,464
Way to take my pearls of wisdom
and flush them down the toilet.

736
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,924
No. Walt, did we...

737
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,101
Lose focus like I told you not to?

738
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,730
Focus?

739
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,640
Let me jangle your minds.

740
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,067
You came here
to get back something you lost.

741
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:44,943
Something you love.

742
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,442
- Gary!
- Gary!

743
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,527
Yeah, Gary.

744
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,031
Seriously, it's hard enough
being stuck in a tumbleweed...

745
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,831
Patrick, we got to find Gary!

746
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,786
But dealing with you two
makes me want to light myself on fire.

747
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,086
Sage, buddy.

748
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,380
Can we please
look into the window of meanwhile

749
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,583
one more time to see where Gary is?

750
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:06,215
No, it's not an on-demand service.

751
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,966
And especially
not for people who pass out

752
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:09,888
and sleep in their own vomit
all night.

753
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,301
It's not vomit. It's drool.

754
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,770
Fortunately for you,
you woke up right here,

755
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,021
on the steps of Poseidon's palace.

756
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,527
Now get it together. Go!

757
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:31,202
All right, Gary. We're coming for yal!

758
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,871
Boy, oh, boy. Hey.
Almost there, Gary.

759
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,916
Hey, hop on!

760
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,673
They're just giving these things away
at the grocery store.

761
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,798
Good call, buddy.

762
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,175
Hot stuff coming through!

763
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,303
Get a load of this place, Patrick.

764
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:56,768
Hello.

765
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,472
We would like an audience
with his majesty king Poseidon.

766
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:03,435
Sure. Let me check.
Two rubes to see Poseidon. No.

767
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,981
Hey, dude.
We're the blue fin group.

768
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,407
Of course. Right this...

769
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,987
The blue fin group! No!

770
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,082
Hey!

771
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,213
Hey!

772
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:28,008
I'm Tiffany haddock
and I'm here just for the Halibut.

773
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,345
All right, then.

774
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:35,470
Our next performers are gonna knock...

775
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,310
Poseidon?

776
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,438
We are getting an audience
with the king.

777
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:50,239
Well, let's have it. Perform, please!

778
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:55,286
Hey! Aka waka maka Mia
was a puffer fish

779
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:59,119
being bigger than a puffer
was his only wish

780
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,576
and so he huffed, he puffed

781
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,830
he billowed and he blew

782
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:05,796
- Gary!
- Gary!

783
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:08,882
Gary, I'm coming, buddy!

784
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,010
Excuse me. Sorry. My bad.

785
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,101
Sorry.

786
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,266
Hi, there! Excuse me,
king Poseidon, sire.

787
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,060
There's been
a misunderstanding about Gary.

788
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,151
Gary?

789
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,567
- Gary.
- Gary?

790
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,673
The snail that you're rubbing
all over your face right now.

791
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,530
Nonsense.
Besides, this snail's name is Fred.

792
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,699
"Fred"? You renamed Gary?

793
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,401
- Fred.
- Gary.

794
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,987
- Fred! Fred!
- Gary! Gary!

795
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,322
- Fred!
- Gary!

796
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:40,577
Fred!

797
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,868
Seize them!

798
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,043
Gary!

799
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:46,548
Gary!

800
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,544
But Gary loves me!
And I love him.

801
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,308
Incoming!

802
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:12,859
Good rockets.

803
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,358
Spongebob?

804
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:19,116
Get yer co-pilot goggles, dude,
'cause we're goin' sleddin'!

805
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:20,957
Spongebob?

806
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,084
You in here?

807
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,370
Spongebob?

808
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:31,839
Spongebob!

809
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,214
That's weird.

810
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,553
Something's fishy around here.

811
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,477
All right, what'd y'all do
with spongebob?

812
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:54,905
We don't know where he is, Sandy.
Hasn't been here in days.

813
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,113
Don't you play coy
with me, cephalopod.

814
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:01,947
And you, arthropod!
Start talking. Where is he?

815
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,578
Tied up in the basement?
Stuffed in your trunk?

816
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:09,170
Nay, I could never harm the lad.
His absence has taught me that much.

817
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,464
And I'm not just talking about
the money I'm losing with him gone.

818
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,962
Okay, 50% talking about the money

819
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:20,548
and 50% talking
about I truly miss the boy.

820
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:25,970
I hate to admit it, but things
just aren't the same without him.

821
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:29,728
There's no denying it.
We need spongebob.

822
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,981
Did anyone ever stop to think
that he might need us?

823
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:36,610
This is perch Perkins coming to you
from the lost city of Atlantic city.

824
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,906
I'm standing on the strip

825
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,985
outside Poseidon's palace and casino,
where two suspects

826
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,786
have been taken into custody tonight

827
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,364
following an attempt
on the royal snail.

828
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,166
The sponge and sea star
were impersonating a lounge act

829
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:51,417
when they made an attempt
on Poseidon's prized mollusk.

830
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,381
- It's Gary!
- It's Gary!

831
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,460
The suspects' vehicle was apprehended
after a high-speed chase.

832
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,672
Mr. krabs, what happened to Otto?

833
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:04,054
Well, he took an automated vacation!

834
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,602
In a related story, Poseidon's palace
presents a command performance,

835
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,476
featuring the execution
of the suspects

836
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,058
in the aqua room this Friday night.

837
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:16,862
Execution of the suspects?
What happened to habeas swordfish?

838
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:20,316
It's a fun-filled family event,
with opening act kelpy g.

839
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,367
One performance only,
tickets still available.

840
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,405
- We've got to go help them!
- We embark immediately.

841
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:30,413
Excuse me. Can I tag along?

842
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,746
Plankton?
What have you got to do with this?

843
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,964
I might have had
a teensy-weensy hand in a very...

844
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,967
Yeah, we'll hear about it in the car.
Mr. squidward, are ya coming?

845
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,177
Fat chance.

846
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,770
Fat chance I'd miss
a kelpy g performance. I'm in.

847
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,848
To the pattymobile!

848
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,491
What, this old tub?

849
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:06,116
Never judge
a pattymobile by its bun, squidward.

850
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,836
Let's light this puppy!

851
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:38,652
Mommy!

852
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,646
Spongebob? Are you okay?

853
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,778
Hey, buddy. Sorry about this.

854
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,239
It's not your fault, Patrick.

855
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,783
You've been a true friend
this whole time.

856
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:30,238
Never wavered,
never faltered. It's just...

857
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,494
I failed, that's all!

858
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,876
And I'll never see
innocent little Gary again.

859
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,417
My heart is broken!

860
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:44,881
Come on now.
Buck up. It's not over yet, spongebob.

861
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,385
It sure feels over. And crappy.

862
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,182
Just saying
there's two sides to every coin.

863
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,058
Patrick, what does a coin have to...
Wait, did you just say "coin"?

864
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,140
Me? Don't think so.

865
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,022
You did. You said "coin"!

866
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,736
Not remembering that exactly.

867
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,320
- Hello?
- The challenge coin! Of course!

868
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:10,494
Don't you see, Patrick? We're saved!

869
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:11,946
I said hello!

870
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,373
Patrick, it's gone!

871
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:18,665
Was the challenge coin
really that useful?

872
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,246
Hello?

873
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,508
- Stupid prank callers.
- Hey, wait a sec.

874
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:28,463
I gave it to you, remember?
For safe keeping.

875
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:29,672
No.

876
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,759
Come on, it was last night!
We were at the crappie tables.

877
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:36,269
Winner! Place your bets.

878
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:40,975
Come on, seven!

879
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,279
You!

880
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,105
You gambled away my challenge coin!

881
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,613
You wrecked our entire mission
with one stupid bet!

882
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,240
Well, only after you kept saying...

883
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:56,040
Let it ride, Patrick! Let it ride!

884
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,789
But, spongebob, what if you need
the challenge coin tomorrow

885
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,586
to help you summon your courage?

886
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,584
Tomorrow is for weenies!

887
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,138
Well, it's tomorrow
and guess who's the weenie.

888
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:17,432
I can't believe you!

889
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:21,107
You can't believe me?
Are you serious right now?

890
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:24,276
Well! Maybe you can believe this.

891
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:25,478
I'm out of here!

892
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,656
And don't come back!

893
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,780
Don't worry, I won't!

894
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,911
- Good!
- Everl

895
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,412
- fine!
- Super!

896
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,249
Hey, losers.

897
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,998
Hey, Sage.

898
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:49,881
Sage, glad you're here. Guess who
gambled away my challenge coin.

899
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,213
Guess who blames
everyone else for his troubles.

900
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,307
Enough!

901
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,300
Did I mention
you are the worst epic heroes

902
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,556
for whom I have ever been
a spirit guide?

903
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,683
I think we went over that
this morning.

904
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,184
I believe we did, yeah.

905
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:08,024
Spongebob, the coin was just a symbol.

906
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,448
The courage you seek
is inside you, not in the coin.

907
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,947
And it will come to you
in your hour of need.

908
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,619
But isn't this my hour of need?

909
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,867
No. It gets way worse.

910
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:22,670
Bye!

911
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:26,414
- Worse?
- Dude said, "way worse."

912
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,214
Prepare the prisoners.

913
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,636
That couldn't be for us.

914
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,681
It's your big moment to fry.
I mean, shine.

915
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,759
It is for us, Patrick!
We're gonna die!

916
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:45,225
And that's how
I got spongebob out of bikini bottom.

917
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,935
- That's monstrous!
- Wait, that sounds good.

918
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,942
- Oh, brother.
- What do you expect? I'm evil.

919
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:52,523
Let's just focus on the plan.

920
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:56,827
We're approaching
the lost city of Atlantic city.

921
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,237
Make way there, make way!

922
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:09,791
"Sponge and star
execution extravaganza"?

923
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,625
No time to lose!

924
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,467
Ladies and gentlefish,
welcome to the aqua room, y'all.

925
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,268
The greatest show underwater.

926
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,271
My groupies and groupers...

927
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,522
- We love you, Tiffany!
- Yeah, holler at your girl!

928
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,193
Are you ready to be entertained?

929
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,153
I can't hear you.
Are you ready to be entertained?

930
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,745
All right, then,
let's meet the contestants.

931
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:43,164
In this corner, a sponge and a star.

932
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,833
Two of the ocean's
most notorious criminals!

933
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:52,250
And in this corner,
representing his majesty the king,

934
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:56,428
Poseidon's very own chancellor!

935
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,760
Now drum roll, maestro.

936
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:03,469
Put your fins together
for the Duke of the dirty deed,

937
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:07,932
the Earl of execution,
that axe-wielding maniac.

938
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,312
Yeah, lemont!

939
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,522
Lemont!

940
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,946
I love me some lemont.

941
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,121
He's so strong.

942
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:30,329
Ladies and gentlemen,
with a moment of smooth jazz

943
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:35,418
in memory of the soon-to-be-goners,
I give you kelpy g.

944
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,891
Patrick, I feel terrible.
I dragged you into this whole mess.

945
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:54,900
It's okay, spongebob. I made
a plea deal with the prosecution!

946
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,694
That's good. Wait, you did what?

947
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,026
All I have to do 1s... yeah!

948
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:04,284
"Bring incriminating evidence
against the defendant."

949
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,123
Patrick, I'm the defendant.

950
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,210
You are?

951
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:22,305
Let the proceedings begin!

952
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:26,226
Your honor, I would like
to enter into evidence,

953
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:29,931
one sea snail. Name: Fred.

954
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:32,770
Gary!

955
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:36,979
How dare you!
That's about all I can say.

956
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,281
How dare you come here,

957
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:43,201
to the sanctuary
of our revered sovereign,

958
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:48,999
to Rob him of his very lifeblood,
his adorable good looks.

959
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,285
Go on.

960
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,621
How indeed dare you?

961
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,760
Guilty!

962
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:02,171
Lemont!

963
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,560
Hold it!

964
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,684
If it please the court,

965
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:17,895
I'd like to say something
in spongebob's defense.

966
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,445
It does not please the court.

967
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:22,195
Sit down,
squirrel with fishbowl on head!

968
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:26,369
But, sire, a strong defense
makes for a better show.

969
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,821
Isn't that right, audience?

970
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:34,787
All right! I'll allow it.

971
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,462
Thank you, your honor.

972
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:41,673
Ladies and gentlemen, spongebob has
always been there for me.

973
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,049
Even going
all the way back to summer camp.

974
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,140
In fact, that's where we all met.

975
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,111
I'm...

976
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,324
Ready!

977
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,923
Look at all the cool activities!

978
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,753
Camping, canoeing,
seahorse-back riding,

979
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,463
tug of war, whale watching!

980
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,593
Do you mind?

981
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:32,394
Juggling contests,
shrink-wrap soccer, and more!

982
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:41,861
Hey, y'all critters
of the seal look out below!

983
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:46,779
I'm Sandy cheeks from Texas.

984
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,610
Hi, Sandy. I'm spongebob.

985
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,195
Pleased to meet ya.

986
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,827
Does everybody wear spacesuits
in Texas?

987
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,660
They do if they wanna
visit you underwater critters.

988
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,086
We all breathe air on the surface.

989
01:01:58,173 --> 01:01:59,959
It's just our way
of synthesizing oxygen.

990
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,086
Same as you do with water.

991
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,714
Are you a scientist?

992
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,387
Naw, I'm just a squirrel.

993
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:12,639
I can't be a scientist.
Even though it's kinda my dream.

994
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:17,018
Sandy cheeks, you take that back!
I bet you can do anything.

995
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,108
Really?

996
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,935
Me a scientist?

997
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:26,659
Science.

998
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:31,616
You're a hoot, little dude.

999
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,662
I'd be just as likely
to live down here

1000
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,911
in a glass dome with a tree in it.

1001
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:38,205
You never know!

1002
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:53,175
He's the one that told me,
no matter who I was,

1003
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:57,354
or where I came from,
I should follow my dream.

1004
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,605
That's a friend, people.

1005
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,149
And that's why, in my eyes...

1006
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,860
Spongebob is no criminal.

1007
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:10,359
He's the best little fella to ever
walk the sea bottom. And that's...

1008
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:13,362
That's just how I feel about it. So...

1009
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,076
Please, don't hurt him.

1010
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,462
This man broke the law!

1011
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,544
The law of: "You should stay home

1012
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,596
"and accept the fact
that somebody stole your snail."

1013
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,927
The law of: "There's probably
nothing I can do about it."

1014
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:40,601
Well, in this sea star's opinion,

1015
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:45,812
those laws should be broken
and spongebob is proof of it!

1016
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:50,532
All he's guilty of
is having the fortitude

1017
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:53,109
to try and rescue a friend.

1018
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,498
How do I know?

1019
01:03:57,292 --> 01:04:01,501
I was just a lonely bump on a log
when I first met him.

1020
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,255
Hi, my name...

1021
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:14,767
Hi, my name...

1022
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,760
Hello, my name is spongebob,
what's your name?

1023
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,647
I'm pa-pa-Patrick.

1024
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,186
Why are you crying, pa-pa-Patrick?

1025
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,441
I'm homesick.

1026
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,400
Well, that's a pretty good reason.

1027
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,826
Maybe all you need is a friend.

1028
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:40,411
I don't have any friends!

1029
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:42,834
- Well, you've got one now.
- Really?

1030
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,999
- Who is it?
- It's me!

1031
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:49,333
- Do you mean it?
- Of course. Come on!

1032
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,966
That sweet little sponge

1033
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:58,008
rescued this miserable
little sea star.

1034
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:01,595
And things haven't changed
that much today, your honor.

1035
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,024
My heart, buddy.

1036
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:20,747
I don't like spongebob.
In fact, I revile him.

1037
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:29,168
Anyway, I, too,
met this nabob in summer camp.

1038
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:32,045
I remember it like it was yesterday.

1039
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:36,847
It was my big night.
The annual camp coral talent show.

1040
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:43,102
And first prize
was the coveted campy award.

1041
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,554
Thank you, Larry.

1042
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,605
Remember, people,
don't forget to vote.

1043
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,404
As far as I was concerned,
the trophy was as good as mine.

1044
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,609
Hey, squidward...

1045
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:01,325
Quiet. I'm in pregame right now.

1046
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,120
I've got an award to win.

1047
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,591
Aka waka maka Mia
was a puffer fish

1048
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,591
the campy is mine.

1049
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,810
I bathed the audience

1050
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:31,939
with the sounds
of my heavenly clarinet playing.

1051
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,912
Thank you, squidward. Just lovely.

1052
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,288
Thank you.

1053
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,878
And the campy goes to...

1054
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:54,968
I'll take that.

1055
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:56,884
Opongebob and Patrick!

1056
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:01,306
No!

1057
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:06,683
This isn't happening! No! Mommy!

1058
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:12,359
I was robbed.
And never to play the clarinet again.

1059
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,567
No.

1060
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,032
- Squidward!
- Go away!

1061
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,956
Patrick and I were

1062
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,754
talking to one of the counselors
and guess what?

1063
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:37,550
There was a big mistake
and you actually won the campy award!

1064
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:39,047
That's right. Yup.

1065
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:42,965
- I did?
- In a landslide.

1066
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:47,310
So weird
they would've miscounted like that.

1067
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,308
But I guess it's possible...

1068
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:53,350
- Nice work, squidward.
- No one deserves it more.

1069
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:57,237
And don't ever stop playing this.

1070
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:01,316
My clarinet.
Look at me. I really did it!

1071
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:08,574
Which is why, even though
I can't stand spongebob,

1072
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:11,159
but at the same time, well...

1073
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:12,754
I love him.

1074
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,046
I love him and I hate him.

1075
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:21,087
He's like ice cream with salt on it,
because he's sweet and super annoying.

1076
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:25,093
He's nice
and nails-on-chalkboard annoying!

1077
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:28,096
Okay, fine,
he's mostly super freaking annoying.

1078
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:31,930
But this little nattering noodge...

1079
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:33,734
Is my friend.

1080
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,480
And he doesn't deserve to die.

1081
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:47,613
I'll be saying my piece now,
if it be pleasing the court.

1082
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,407
I suppose I could stand up here

1083
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,834
and tell you
how spongebob changed me life.

1084
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:55,920
But I won't.

1085
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,165
I might even speak
about how he inspired me

1086
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:03,003
when I was just a small-time vendor
with a broken-down luncheonette.

1087
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:06,009
But, I won't.

1088
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,140
Heck, I'd probably mention

1089
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:10,427
how he encouraged me
to start me own restaurant.

1090
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:13,058
You should open up
your own restaurant, someday.

1091
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:17,108
The krusty krab, made famous
by me delicious krabby patties!

1092
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:19,561
Two-for-one wednesdays, by the way.
Pass these around.

1093
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,068
But, I won't.

1094
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,446
Nay, you'll hear
none such praise from me.

1095
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:28,286
Because it wouldn't do him
full justice.

1096
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,536
It wouldn't begin to describe
the size of the lad's heart.

1097
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,835
Which is huge.

1098
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,425
And he puts that heart
into everything he does.

1099
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,511
- The cooking...
- Order up!

1100
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:46,598
Cleaning...

1101
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,136
Serving up
the delicious krabby patties.

1102
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,183
But that's the funny thing.

1103
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,687
I used to think
me secret krabby Patty formula...

1104
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,314
Was also the secret to me success.

1105
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,351
We serve breakfast till 11:00,
by the way, 12:00 on weekends.

1106
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:04,530
It wasn't until spongebob
came to work for me,

1107
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:09,532
that I realized the formula is more
than just a list of ingredients

1108
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,408
and flavor-capturing methods.

1109
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:14,741
It's more than
a jealously guarded recipe.

1110
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,493
The real secret formula...

1111
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,580
Is sitting right here.

1112
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:24,251
Spongebob squarepants.

1113
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:29,846
Get ready.

1114
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,560
Maestro?

1115
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:42,147
A formula is something like a recipe

1116
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:45,025
a recipe is something like a plan

1117
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,277
with elements and measurements

1118
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:50,531
all mixed together by a steady hand

1119
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:55,244
but careful you must be
or you'll be sad you see

1120
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,497
if somehow in the mix, it has no soul

1121
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,453
so what's the one ingredient

1122
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:03,210
that turns this awesome sauce
to liquid gold?

1123
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:04,586
I'll tell ya!

1124
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:10,464
The secret to the formula is you, you

1125
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:11,673
you, you

1126
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:16,933
the honey in my tea,
you know is you, you

1127
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:18,513
you, you

1128
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:21,190
the bubbles in the boil

1129
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,393
the one essential oil

1130
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,069
it's true

1131
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:29,695
the secret to the formula is you, you

1132
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:30,786
spongebob!

1133
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:31,870
You, you

1134
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,661
what in the wide watery world

1135
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:40,085
would it be like without you?

1136
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:45,006
The secret to the formula is you, you

1137
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,377
you, you

1138
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:52,009
the honey in my tea,
you know is you, you

1139
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:53,305
you, you

1140
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,974
the bubbles in the boil

1141
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:59,896
the one essential oll, it's true

1142
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:04,442
the secret to the formula is you, you

1143
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:05,529
spongebob!

1144
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:06,773
You, you

1145
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:11,153
the secret to the formula is you, you

1146
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,405
- spongebob!
- So entertaining!

1147
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:18,206
The secret to the formula is you, you

1148
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,953
you, you

1149
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:24,958
hilarious!

1150
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:29,922
My snail!

1151
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,887
Halt! It's a trick! Seize them!

1152
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:50,146
Gary, you're with me now.
I'll never let anyone take you again.

1153
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,156
Faster!

1154
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,452
- Patrick, what are you doing?
- Free food!

1155
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,212
Get him!

1156
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,551
Come on. In here!

1157
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:14,469
Stop right there!

1158
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:17,223
Inside! Quick!

1159
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:26,307
Come on!

1160
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:31,191
Push! Push, plankton!

1161
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:32,943
You got to be kidding me!

1162
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,177
Peekaboo!

1163
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:03,893
Attack!

1164
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:10,310
Attack!

1165
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,980
Watch your left flank, people!

1166
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:17,988
Thrust! Now parry!
Now pirouette. Turn around. Pivot!

1167
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:21,613
Pull harder. Faster! To the right!

1168
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,977
Do you think we should've stayed
in there with squidward?

1169
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:50,899
Nah, he's got it.

1170
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,773
Where is everybody?

1171
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:54,148
Charge!

1172
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,286
- Squidward!
- Squidward!

1173
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:15,132
Squidward! Fall this way!

1174
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:16,584
No, this way!

1175
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:22,767
Man down.

1176
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:26,184
Good catch.

1177
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,930
- Hey, there they are!
- Get them!

1178
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:32,058
- Yo, what's up?
- Otto!

1179
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:34,144
I have a gambling problem.

1180
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:39,573
- Otto!
- Could anyone lend me some money?

1181
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,576
To bikini bottom! And step on it!

1182
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:44,119
Stepping on it.

1183
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,239
You're all fired.

1184
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,619
To the valet!

1185
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:54,914
Leaving so soon, kids?

1186
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:58,418
Hang on, Gary.
I won't let you go.

1187
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,629
Tsk, tsk.
Rather impolite, don't you think?

1188
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,305
It was all their idea, sire.

1189
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:05,053
And I...

1190
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,513
Loved it!

1191
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,470
Wait, so you're not mad at us?

1192
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:10,805
No.

1193
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,609
It's been a while since I've enjoyed
such toe-tapping entertainment.

1194
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,060
All is forgiven!

1195
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:18,111
And all charges are dropped.

1196
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:20,731
On one condition.

1197
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:26,321
Spongebob will return my snail to me
without any more shilly-shally.

1198
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,780
Wait, what?

1199
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,867
Just hand over the snail
and you can all go free.

1200
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,331
But... I...

1201
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:37,881
Spongebob.

1202
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,633
Sage? Is that you?

1203
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:41,881
Hello.

1204
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:43,587
Sage! Hi!

1205
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:47,015
Remember.
The courage you seek is inside you.

1206
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,594
And it will come to you
in your hour of need.

1207
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,897
The courage is inside me.

1208
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,068
The courage is inside me!

1209
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:03,400
Mr. Poseidon, no.
I'm sorry, but I won't do it.

1210
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:06,287
What?

1211
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,863
I love Gary too much and he loves me.

1212
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,582
If we didn't have each other,
we'd be so sad,

1213
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:14,456
well, it wouldn't really matter
what you'd do to us.

1214
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:19,590
And look, today,
thanks to these amazing friends,

1215
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:23,010
my heart feels
twice as big as it ever did.

1216
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,096
Especially after
what they risked for me:

1217
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:29,346
Flouting the law and defying
the mighty king of the sea.

1218
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,177
Defying? Really?

1219
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:34,730
I wouldn't say defying the king.

1220
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:37,024
Humiliating you
in front of your subjects.

1221
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,272
- Do go on.
- More like admiring.

1222
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:42,571
- And totally agreeing with!
- I just came to see kelpy g.

1223
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,569
And they did it all for me.

1224
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,652
I'm sure you'd understand
if you had friends like these.

1225
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:49,407
Friends like these?

1226
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,991
Wait, what? Friends like these?

1227
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:58,413
Of course I have friends like these.
I have all kinds of friends.

1228
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,964
I have buddies, I have besties.

1229
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:04,384
I have home-slices, palsy-walsies.

1230
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:05,836
It's infinite!

1231
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:09,469
Chancellor, give us an exact number.
The friend count, if you will.

1232
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:12,552
Okay, according
to your latest polling data...

1233
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:15,479
We should get more polling data.

1234
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:16,566
What? Give me that.

1235
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,608
What about my adoring fans?

1236
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,237
- Nope.
- My elite palace guards?

1237
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:25,610
What about my personal trainer?

1238
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:29,652
- My therapist?
- Nada.

1239
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,578
- My tattoo artist?
- Nope.

1240
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,826
- My tattoo removal artist?
- No dice.

1241
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:39,629
But surely you,
my chancellor, my loyal faithful?

1242
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:40,715
Sorry.

1243
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,674
Apollo, take me now.

1244
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:56,767
I don't have any friends!

1245
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:01,058
Well, you got one now.

1246
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,858
Really? Who is it?

1247
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:06,860
It's me! I'll be your friend.

1248
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,025
Do you mean it?

1249
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:12,737
Yes. But friends don't kidnap
friends' pet snails.

1250
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,905
But I need that snail.

1251
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,242
Look, I have a horrible,
disgusting wrinkle.

1252
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,953
Jumping jellyfish,
it's the size of the Mariana trench!

1253
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:24,707
Kidding! Looks don't matter.

1254
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:28,386
We don't care about little
imperfections or even big ones.

1255
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:30,758
- Just look at squidward.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1256
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:32,714
What's important is what's inside.

1257
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,142
And I'm sure
you can be a fair and kind king

1258
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:39,347
to all the creatures of the sea.
I know you've got it in you, sir.

1259
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,602
If you'd just let
your hair down a little.

1260
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:45,520
My hair? Wait a minute.

1261
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:49,698
Are you suggesting that I don't need
this gorgeous mane of wavy locks?

1262
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:53,778
That I don't require this neck clip?

1263
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:00,788
Be gone, perfect shiny teeth!

1264
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,666
This is so freeing!

1265
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,998
To heck with this chest plate
and girdle.

1266
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:11,128
- Too far?
- No! Not at all!

1267
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,589
No, you look great!

1268
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:17,518
Thank you!
I find this so exhilarating.

1269
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:19,845
So age appropriate.

1270
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:25,060
Spongebob, few possess the courage
to stand up to a powerful king.

1271
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:29,318
You, sir, are among those few.
I salute you.

1272
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:31,273
Nailed it, spongebob.

1273
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,077
Sage out.

1274
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:35,778
You may keep Gary.

1275
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:39,115
And I wish you
many happy years together.

1276
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:41,666
Thank you!
Did you hear that, gare-bear?

1277
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:44,537
Your royal robe, your highness.

1278
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:47,418
- It's getting cold out here.
- Nonsense, chancellor.

1279
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:48,919
I'm free!

1280
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:50,918
You certainly are.

1281
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:53,220
And free the snails!

1282
01:20:58,479 --> 01:20:59,594
What's that?

1283
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:03,973
All of 'em?

1284
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,773
I'm home!

1285
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,367
Hello, Gary.

1286
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:17,490
Hello, Brian.

1287
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:24,077
Hello, Janet. Hello, June. Hola, lupe.

1288
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,789
- Morning, Sally!
- Hi, Brett!

1289
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:43,770
Come on, mom! Hurry!

1290
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,019
Come on, Gary! You can do it!

1291
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,145
Yeah!

1292
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:59,828
Fabio! Where are you, buddy?

1293
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:01,872
Here, fabio.

1294
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,495
Come on, Fifi. No.

1295
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:29,277
Order up!
