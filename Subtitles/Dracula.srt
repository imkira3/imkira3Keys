2
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:42,063
The year, 1462.

3
00:00:42,265 --> 00:00:45,428
Constantinople had fallen.

4
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:49,505
Moslem Turks swept into Europe with a vast, superior force...

5
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:53,711
...striking at Romania,
threatening all of Christendom.

6
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:56,347
From Transylvania arose a Romanian knight...

7
00:00:56,447 --> 00:01:00,767
...of the Sacred Order of the Dragon,
known as Dracula.

8
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,061
On the eve of the battle...

9
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:21,932
...his bride Elisabeta...

10
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,343
...whom he prized above all things on Earth...

11
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:29,603
...knew that he must face an insurmountable force...

12
00:01:29,692 --> 00:01:33,344
...from which he might never return.

13
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:34,979
God be praised.
I am victorious.

14
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:46,683
Elisabeta.

15
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:53,468
The vengeful Turks shot an arrow into the castle...

16
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,928
...carrying false news of Dracula's death.

17
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:59,600
Elisabeta, believing him dead...

18
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:02,674
...flung herself into the river.

19
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,850
My prince is dead.

20
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:46,078
All is lost without him.

21
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:49,019
May God unite us in heaven.

22
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:05,766
She has taken her own life.

23
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:08,576
Her soul cannot be saved.

24
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:11,779
She is damned.

25
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:13,949
It is God's law.

26
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,497
Is this my reward for defending God's church?

27
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:27,665
Sacrilege.

28
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:31,360
I renounce God.

29
00:04:32,236 --> 00:04:35,831
I shall rise from my own death...

30
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:40,600
...to avenge hers with all the powers of darkness.

31
00:04:58,363 --> 00:05:01,423
The blood is the life...

32
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:06,395
...and it shall be mine.

33
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,682
I've done everything that you asked, master.

34
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:10,532
All the preparations are in order.

35
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,440
Everything.

36
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,202
I await your command.

37
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,970
For I know...

38
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:21,307
...that when the rewards are given...

39
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:26,316
...I will be one of those who benefits from your generosity.

40
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,625
Thank you.

41
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,723
Gone mad.
Renfield is deranged.

42
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,836
He's lost his greedy mind,
poor chap.

43
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:43,439
I want you to take over for his foreign client...

44
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,641
...this rather eccentric Count Dracula.

45
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:48,977
He's buying up property in London.
- Of course, sir.

46
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:51,914
I'll attend to the count.
Thank you for your confidence.

47
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:55,117
This is a great opportunity for you, Harker.

48
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:58,387
But you'll have to leave for Transylvania immediately.

49
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:02,124
Opportunities such as this come but once in a lifetime.

50
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:04,489
Yes, of course, sir.

51
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:06,262
If I may inquire...

52
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:10,033
...what, in fact, happened to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

53
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,260
Nothing. Nothing.

54
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,469
Personal problems.

55
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:16,406
Close these transactions...

56
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:19,709
...and your future with this firm is assured.

57
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:23,169
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

58
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:29,503
We've waited this long,
haven't we?

59
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:32,121
We can be married when I return.

60
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:35,159
Of course.

61
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,591
I'll write.

62
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,629
Jonathan.

63
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:47,035
Jonathan, I love you.

64
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:49,103
I love you, Mina.

65
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:21,771
25th May, Budapest.

66
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,342
Left Budapest early this morning.

67
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:27,245
The impression I had was that we were leaving the west...

68
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:29,346
...and entering the east.

69
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:33,886
The district I am to enter is in the extreme east of the country...

70
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,688
...just on the borders of three states...

71
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:38,458
...Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina...

72
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:40,726
...in the midst of the Carpathian Mountains...

73
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:45,386
...one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe.

74
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,398
'My friend...

75
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:52,765
...welcome to the Carpathians.

76
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:56,100
I am anxiously expecting you.

77
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:58,310
At the Borgo Pass...

78
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:02,149
...my carriage will await you and bring you to me.

79
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:07,016
I trust your journey from London has been a happy one...

80
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,057
...and that you will enjoy your stay...

81
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:13,217
...in my beautiful land.

82
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:17,261
Your friend, D. ”

83
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:28,337
Diary, 25th May.

84
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:31,774
My Jonathan has been gone almost a week.

85
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:35,884
And although I was disappointed we
could not marry before his departure...

86
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:39,287
...I am happy that he got sent on this important assignment.

87
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:42,151
I am longing to hear all the news.

88
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:46,191
It must be so nice to see strange countries.

89
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:49,564
I wonder if we...
I mean Jonathan and I...

90
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:52,224
...shall ever see them together.

91
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,345
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

92
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:12,649
For the dead travel fast.

93
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,962
I say, is the castle far?

94
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:52,517
Welcome to my home.

95
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:55,857
Enter freely of your own will...

96
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:58,927
...and leave some of the happiness you bring.

97
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,895
Count Dracula?

98
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:02,995
I am...

99
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:05,063
...Dracula.

100
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,897
And I bid you welcome,
Mr. Harker, to my house.

101
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:14,174
Come in.

102
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:33,025
You will, I trust,
excuse me that I...

103
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,424
...do not join you.

104
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:40,963
But I have already dined.

105
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,768
And I never drink...

106
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,337
...wine.

107
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:57,617
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

108
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:02,616
The Order of the Dracul.

109
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,188
The Dragon.

110
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:09,729
An ancient society...

111
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,495
...pledging my forefathers...

112
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:18,184
...to defend their church against all enemies of Christ.

113
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:24,846
That relationship was not entirely...

114
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:28,317
...successful.

115
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:30,402
Oh, yes.

116
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:37,150
It is no laughing matter.

117
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:43,894
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

118
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:47,072
What devil or witch was ever so great as Attila...

119
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:50,471
...whose blood flows in these veins?

120
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,380
Blood...

121
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:05,851
...is too precious a thing in these times.

122
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:14,495
The warlike days are over.

123
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:19,699
The victories of my great race...

124
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:22,602
...are but a tale to be told.

125
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:29,671
I am the last of my kind.

126
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:35,785
I have offended you with my ignorance, Count.

127
00:15:36,322 --> 00:15:38,323
Forgive me.

128
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:53,741
I do so long to go through the crowded streets...

129
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:56,036
...of your mighty London...

130
00:15:56,243 --> 00:16:01,015
...to be in the midst of the whirl and the rush of humanity...

131
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:03,379
...to share its life...

132
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:06,577
...its changes, its death.

133
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:10,155
There. You, Count, are...

134
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:15,330
Are the owner of Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.

135
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,591
Congratulations.

136
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,495
Your firm writes most highly...

137
00:16:20,702 --> 00:16:22,103
...of your talents.

138
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:25,969
They say you are a man of good...

139
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:28,174
...taste.

140
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:32,180
And that you are a worthy substitute...

141
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,048
...to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

142
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,847
You may rely on me, Count.

143
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:42,825
Forgive my curiosity,
but why ten houses...

144
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:45,661
...in such precise locations around London?

145
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:48,355
Is it to raise the market value?

146
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:53,627
Do you believe in destiny?

147
00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:01,135
That even the powers of time...

148
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:04,541
...can be altered for a single purpose?

149
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:16,426
The luckiest man who walks on this Earth...

150
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:19,620
...is the one who finds...

151
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,060
...true love.

152
00:17:22,265 --> 00:17:24,927
You found Mina.

153
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:27,433
I thought she was lost.

154
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:30,838
We're to be married as soon as I return.

155
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:33,000
Are you married, Count?

156
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:35,546
Sir...

157
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:37,646
...are you married?

158
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,749
I was married once.

159
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:44,148
Ages ago, it seems.

160
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:47,423
She died.

161
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:51,293
I'm very sorry.

162
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,361
She was fortunate.

163
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,335
My life, at its best, is misery.

164
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:07,183
She will no doubt make a devoted wife.

165
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,848
And you a faithful husband.

166
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:16,021
Come.

167
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:19,716
Write now, my friend,
to your firm...

168
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:23,862
...and to any loved ones,
and say that it shall please you...

169
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:25,962
...to stay with me...

170
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:28,246
...until a month from now.

171
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:31,602
A month?

172
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:35,119
Do you wish me to stay so long?

173
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:41,243
I will take no refusal.

174
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:56,085
Diary, 30th of May, 1897.

175
00:18:56,297 --> 00:19:00,935
I know Jonathan does not want me to
stay here with Lucy while he is away.

176
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:05,372
He thinks that if I become accustomed
to the wealth of the Westenra family...

177
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:09,343
...I will not be content as the wife of a mere clerk in a law firm.

178
00:19:09,443 --> 00:19:12,246
But Lucy and I have been friends since we were children...

179
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:17,146
...and she has never minded that I am only a schoolmistress.

180
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,920
How disgustingly awful.

181
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:31,898
Mina.

182
00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:39,972
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

183
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:43,378
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...

184
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:47,215
...forcing you to learn that ridiculous machine?

185
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,584
When he could be forcing you to perform...

186
00:19:49,684 --> 00:19:53,890
...unspeakable acts of desperate passion on the parlor floor.

187
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,591
Lucy, really.

188
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:58,594
You shouldn't talk about my fiancé in such a way.

189
00:19:58,694 --> 00:20:02,374
There's more to marriage than carnal pleasure.

190
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:06,159
Oh, Mina. So I see.

191
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:08,735
Much, much more.

192
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:13,173
That's...

193
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:17,675
What is it, Lucy?

194
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,314
Because I don't understand it.

195
00:20:21,218 --> 00:20:23,778
Can a man and woman really do...

196
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,289
...that?

197
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:27,857
I did, only last night.

198
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:30,754
Fibber. You did not.
- Yes, I did.

199
00:20:32,062 --> 00:20:34,997
Well, in my dreams.

200
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:37,996
Jonathan measures up,
doesn't he?

201
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:40,201
You can tell Lucy.

202
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:43,638
We've kissed. That's all.

203
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,720
He thinks he's too poor to marry me.

204
00:20:47,978 --> 00:20:51,482
And it's all the worse now that I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...

205
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:53,251
...my rich friend.

206
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:56,787
Yes, but not even one marriage proposal.

207
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:59,252
And here I am, almost 20...

208
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,721
...practically a hag.

209
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:10,398
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

210
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,466
Oh, look.
- What is that?

211
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:17,834
A Texan.

212
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:20,043
Quincey P. Morris.

213
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,975
He's so young and fresh...

214
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,451
...like a wild stallion between my legs.

215
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,586
You're positively indecent.

216
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,120
I just know what men desire.

217
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,024
Watch.

218
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,649
Quincey, darling.
- Miss Lucy.

219
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,763
Why, you're as fresh as the spring rain.

220
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,863
Oh, thank you.

221
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,261
Please let me touch it.

222
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:50,299
It's so big.

223
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,948
Little girl.

224
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:58,176
Oh, my dear,
sweet little girl.

225
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,444
I hold your hand...

226
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,133
...and you've kissed me.
- Jack.

227
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:07,715
Oceans of love...
Oh, Jack, my darling.

228
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,629
Poor little baby.

229
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,665
My kitten, come over here.

230
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:14,000
Come over here and I'll kiss it better.

231
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,262
My poor little blossom.

232
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,590
My poor little doctor.
Brilliant doctor.

233
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,740
Hello, Quincey.
- Jack.

234
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,111
What a naughty bear.
Let me...

235
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:27,306
Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
- Arthur.

236
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:30,414
Oh, my darling.

237
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:33,018
Oh, you look wonderful.

238
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,950
I'm so sorry about your hat.

239
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:38,059
Charming.
- It's my snake dress.

240
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,527
Is it really?

241
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:42,427
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl...

242
00:22:42,512 --> 00:22:46,568
...but I admit that her free way of speaking shocks me sometimes.

243
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:49,738
Jonathan says it is a defect of the aristocracy...

244
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:52,140
...that they say what they please.

245
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,412
The truth is that I admire Lucy. I'm
not surprised that men flock around her.

246
00:22:57,512 --> 00:23:01,112
I wish I were as pretty and as adored as she.

247
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:12,500
You are the love of my life.

248
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:20,661
What manner of man is this?

249
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:23,906
R.M. Renfield,
successful solicitor...

250
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:26,909
...in the firm of Hawkins and Thompkins...

251
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,879
...respected member of the Lord Nugent's Windem Club...

252
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:34,313
...returns from business abroad in Transylvania...

253
00:23:34,517 --> 00:23:37,553
...promptly suffers a complete mental breakdown.

254
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:40,885
He's now obsessed with some blood lust.

255
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:46,995
George.

256
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:50,932
Wait here.

257
00:23:58,108 --> 00:24:01,211
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...

258
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:03,939
...or a canapé?

259
00:24:04,147 --> 00:24:08,627
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.
How are you feeling tonight?

260
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:11,489
Far better than you,
my lovesick doctor.

261
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:13,491
Is my personal life of interest to you?

262
00:24:13,591 --> 00:24:17,459
Of course it is.
All life interests me.

263
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:20,598
Your diet, Mr. Renfield,
is disgusting.

264
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:24,065
Actually,
they're perfectly nutritious.

265
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:27,033
You see,
each life that I ingest...

266
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:29,399
...gives back life to me.

267
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:35,875
A fly gives you life?

268
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,883
Certainly.

269
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:42,054
But you might as well ask a man to eat
molecules with a pair of chopsticks...

270
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:44,957
...than to interest me in a lesser carnivore.

271
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:49,628
I shall have to invent a new classification of lunatic for you.

272
00:24:49,728 --> 00:24:53,960
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

273
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:57,627
Yes, spiders eat them.

274
00:24:57,836 --> 00:25:00,134
What about sparrows?

275
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:03,604
Oh, yes.
Did you say sparrows?

276
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:07,940
Something larger, perhaps?
- Oh, yes.

277
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:11,408
A kitten.

278
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:13,253
I beg you.

279
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:16,254
A little, sleek... A playful kitten.

280
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:19,896
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.

281
00:25:19,961 --> 00:25:21,828
No one would refuse me a kitten.

282
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:24,192
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

283
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,101
Oh, yes.

284
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:30,201
A big cat.

285
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,406
My salvation depends upon it.
- Your salvation?

286
00:25:33,506 --> 00:25:35,507
Yes. I need lives.

287
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:39,036
I need lives for the master.
- What master?

288
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:43,983
The master will come...

289
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,289
...and he has promised to make me immortal.

290
00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:50,389
How?

291
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:53,492
Get him off.

292
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:56,893
The blood is the life.

293
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:00,058
The blood is the life.

294
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:04,465
30th May, Castle Dracula.

295
00:26:04,673 --> 00:26:09,044
I think strange things which I dare not confess to my own soul.

296
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:10,546
The count...

297
00:26:10,646 --> 00:26:14,116
...the way he looked at Mina's picture fills me with dread...

298
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:19,496
...as if I have a part to play in a story that is not known to me.

299
00:26:42,011 --> 00:26:44,091
I didn't hear you come in.

300
00:26:46,816 --> 00:26:49,842
Take care how you cut yourself.

301
00:26:50,053 --> 00:26:53,420
It is more dangerous than you think.

302
00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:04,757
A foul bauble of man's vanity.

303
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:07,232
Perhaps you should...

304
00:27:07,438 --> 00:27:09,565
...grow a beard.

305
00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:19,912
The letters I requested.

306
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:22,312
Have you written them?

307
00:27:38,903 --> 00:27:40,903
Good.

308
00:27:49,547 --> 00:27:52,880
Should you leave these rooms...

309
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,588
...you will not, by any chance...

310
00:27:56,688 --> 00:28:00,449
...go to sleep in any other part of the castle.

311
00:28:01,694 --> 00:28:03,855
It is old...

312
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:07,998
...and has many bad memories.

313
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:13,664
Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

314
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:26,242
Do not put your faith in such trinkets of deceit.

315
00:28:27,988 --> 00:28:30,718
We are in Transylvania.

316
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:35,752
Transylvania is not England.

317
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:39,090
Our ways are not your ways.

318
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:41,299
And to you...

319
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:44,665
...there shall be many strange things.

320
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:48,102
I've seen many strange things already.

321
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:52,388
Bloody wolves chasing me through some blue inferno.

322
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:59,715
Listen to them.

323
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:07,094
The children of the night.

324
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,396
What sweet music they make.

325
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,591
Music? Those animals?

326
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:52,972
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.

327
00:29:53,176 --> 00:29:56,679
To the firm, to my family and to my beloved Mina.

328
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:01,419
I said nothing of my fears as he will read them, no doubt.

329
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:07,648
I know now that I am a prisoner.

330
00:31:33,012 --> 00:31:35,012
Jonathan.

331
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:38,245
Jonathan, come to me.

332
00:31:47,995 --> 00:31:49,995
Come.

333
00:32:08,215 --> 00:32:10,215
Lay down.

334
00:32:11,318 --> 00:32:13,319
Lay back into my arms.

335
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:25,296
Lay back, Jonathan.

336
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:20,194
What's going on, you tricksters?!

337
00:34:26,324 --> 00:34:30,226
How dare you touch him.
He belongs to me.

338
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:32,829
You yourself never loved.

339
00:34:35,968 --> 00:34:40,564
Yes. I too can love.

340
00:34:42,775 --> 00:34:46,768
And I shall love again.

341
00:34:55,321 --> 00:34:57,983
Are we to have nothing tonight?

342
00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:44,762
'Dearest Mina,
all is well here.

343
00:35:44,973 --> 00:35:47,876
The count has insisted I remain for a month...

344
00:35:47,976 --> 00:35:50,278
...to tutor him in English custom.

345
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:53,711
I can say no more,
except I love you.

346
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:56,611
Ever faithful, Jonathan. ”

347
00:36:00,021 --> 00:36:04,742
The letters I have written have undoubtedly sealed my doom.

348
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:11,433
The count's gypsies, fearless warriors who are loyal to the death...

349
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:14,493
...to whatever nobleman they serve...

350
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:20,276
...day and night they toil,
filling boxes with decrepit earth...

351
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:23,573
...from the bowels of the castle.

352
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,381
They are to be delivered to his newly acquired Carfax Abbey in London.

353
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:35,155
Why do they fill these boxes with earth?

354
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:42,923
I love him. I love him.

355
00:36:46,136 --> 00:36:48,969
It's so wonderful.
I've decided.

356
00:36:49,172 --> 00:36:51,606
I love him and I've said yes.

357
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:55,312
Finally. Don't tell me.
The Texan with the big knife?

358
00:36:55,412 --> 00:36:58,211
Oh, no.
To my dear number three.

359
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:02,318
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
Lord and Lady Holmwood.

360
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,323
You are to be my maid of honor.
Oh, say yes.

361
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:09,823
Mina, what is it?
It's the most exciting day of my life.

362
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:13,228
You don't seem to care.

363
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,567
It's just that I'm so terribly worried about Jonathan.

364
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,903
This letter I received is so...

365
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:23,374
It's so cold. It's so unnatural.
It's not like him at all.

366
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,474
Mina, don't worry.

367
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,172
Captain's log: The Demeter.

368
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,367
27th June, 1897.

369
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:02,548
We picked up 50 boxes of experimental earth...

370
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,968
...bound for London, England.

371
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,287
Set sail at noon into a storm...

372
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:09,956
...that seemed to come out of nowhere...

373
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:12,422
...carrying us out to sea.

374
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:51,122
Third of July.
Second mate has gone missing.

375
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:55,735
Nearing Gibraltar.
Storm continues. Crew uneasy.

376
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:59,504
Believe someone or something...

377
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:02,267
...is aboard the ship with us.

378
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:17,219
Master, I am here.

379
00:39:18,226 --> 00:39:21,196
The master of all life is at hand.

380
00:39:21,397 --> 00:39:23,397
Gather round.

381
00:39:23,482 --> 00:39:25,968
I am here to do your bidding, master.

382
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:28,471
I have worshipped you long and far off.

383
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:31,972
And now you are near, master.

384
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:34,734
I am your slave.

385
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:37,504
I await your command.

386
00:39:37,713 --> 00:39:40,516
The case of Renfield grows more interesting.

387
00:39:40,616 --> 00:39:44,487
Yet, there is method in his madness with his flies and spiders.

388
00:39:44,587 --> 00:39:47,823
Had I the secret of even one such brilliant mind...

389
00:39:47,923 --> 00:39:51,724
...the key to the fancy of one lunatic...

390
00:39:58,134 --> 00:40:00,134
Lucy.

391
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,995
Lucy? Lucy.

392
00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:44,063
No. Do not see me.

393
00:42:59,588 --> 00:43:02,648
Oh. I couldn't control myself.

394
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:06,729
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming.
You're walking in your sleep again.

395
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:10,789
My soul,
it seemed to leave my body.

396
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:15,739
There was this agonizing feeling,
and I couldn't get back to it.

397
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,307
I'm absolutely shaking.

398
00:43:17,407 --> 00:43:19,343
It's all right.
You were dreaming.

399
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:22,746
I had to. It sort of pulled me and lured me.

400
00:43:22,846 --> 00:43:25,906
I had no control.
- It's all right.

401
00:43:26,116 --> 00:43:29,017
It had red eyes.
- Hush now.

402
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:33,059
I still have the taste of his blood in my mouth.

403
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,634
Here we go.
Swing it round here.

404
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:52,641
Master.

405
00:43:53,444 --> 00:43:56,311
I am here to do your bidding.

406
00:43:57,115 --> 00:44:00,346
Master. I am here.

407
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:04,116
I have worshipped you.

408
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:09,962
Contrary to some beliefs,
the vampire...

409
00:44:10,062 --> 00:44:14,099
...like any other night creature,
can move about by day...

410
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:19,079
...though it is not his natural time,
and his powers are weak.

411
00:44:35,121 --> 00:44:38,215
See the amazing cinematograph.

412
00:44:38,424 --> 00:44:41,359
A wonder of modern civilization.

413
00:44:41,561 --> 00:44:43,722
The latest sensation.

414
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:47,050
The greatest attraction of the century.

415
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,863
The new wonder of the world.

416
00:45:14,228 --> 00:45:16,228
See me.

417
00:45:17,998 --> 00:45:19,998
See me now.

418
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,170
Escaped wolf from zoo still at large.

419
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:31,377
Buy a paper, sir?

420
00:45:33,548 --> 00:45:35,548
Thank you, sir.

421
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:41,078
Get your Gazette.
Penny a paper.

422
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:56,827
My humblest apologies.

423
00:45:58,073 --> 00:46:00,941
Forgive my ignorance.

424
00:46:01,143 --> 00:46:04,112
I am recently arrived from abroad...

425
00:46:04,313 --> 00:46:07,282
...and I do not know your city.

426
00:46:07,483 --> 00:46:12,363
Is a beautiful lady...
- A street atlas is sixpence. Good day.

427
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,290
I have offended you.

428
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,096
I am only looking for the cinematograph.

429
00:46:20,196 --> 00:46:23,733
I understand it is a wonder of the civilized world.

430
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:27,496
If you seek culture,
then visit a museum.

431
00:46:27,703 --> 00:46:30,664
London is filled with them.
Excuse me.

432
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,653
A woman so lovely and intelligent...

433
00:46:42,753 --> 00:46:46,356
...should not be walking the streets of London without her gentleman.

434
00:46:46,456 --> 00:46:48,651
Do I know you, sir?

435
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:52,760
Are you acquainted with my husband?

436
00:46:52,963 --> 00:46:54,963
Shall I call the police?

437
00:46:56,668 --> 00:46:58,795
Husband?

438
00:46:59,003 --> 00:47:01,403
I shall bother you no more.

439
00:47:05,176 --> 00:47:07,176
Sir.

440
00:47:07,946 --> 00:47:10,506
It is I who have been rude.

441
00:47:10,715 --> 00:47:13,479
If you're looking...
- Please.

442
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:18,413
Permit me to introduce myself.

443
00:47:20,325 --> 00:47:24,523
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.

444
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:29,726
A prince, no less?
- I am...

445
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:33,170
...your servant.

446
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:37,934
Wilhelmina Murray.

447
00:47:40,946 --> 00:47:43,540
I am...

448
00:47:43,749 --> 00:47:45,749
...honored...

449
00:47:45,918 --> 00:47:47,918
...Madam Mina.

450
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:53,791
This way.

451
00:48:06,806 --> 00:48:08,806
Hello, sir.

452
00:48:08,874 --> 00:48:12,178
Mr. Holmwood asked me to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

453
00:48:12,278 --> 00:48:13,780
Yes, sir.

454
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,600
Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.
- Thank you.

455
00:48:16,716 --> 00:48:18,351
Oh, Jack.

456
00:48:18,451 --> 00:48:21,648
Brilliant Jack.
Do you like it?

457
00:48:23,491 --> 00:48:25,526
Did Arthur put you up to this...

458
00:48:25,626 --> 00:48:29,964
...or did you want me alone just once before I'm married?

459
00:48:30,064 --> 00:48:32,532
Lucy, you're embarrassing me.

460
00:48:32,733 --> 00:48:35,395
I'm here as your doctor.

461
00:48:35,603 --> 00:48:37,838
Your fiancé is very worried about you...

462
00:48:37,938 --> 00:48:42,705
...and I assure you,
a doctor's confidence is sacred.

463
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,470
I must have your complete trust.

464
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:51,684
Help me, Jack.

465
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:55,791
I don't know what's happening to me.

466
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,916
I'm changing.

467
00:48:58,126 --> 00:49:00,126
I can feel it.

468
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,563
I can hear everything.

469
00:49:03,631 --> 00:49:06,668
I hear the servants at the other end of the house, whispering.

470
00:49:06,768 --> 00:49:10,688
I hear mice in the attic,
stomping like elephants.

471
00:49:11,206 --> 00:49:14,486
But I'm having horrible nightmares, Jack.

472
00:49:15,977 --> 00:49:17,579
The eyes.

473
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:19,082
Oh, Jack.

474
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:22,811
I'm here, Lucy.
Nothing will harm you.

475
00:49:25,822 --> 00:49:27,822
Let it work.

476
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:31,453
Thank you.
- Lucy.

477
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:34,027
Oh, Jack, kiss me.

478
00:49:39,168 --> 00:49:42,105
And may I say, Miss Lucy is hotter than a June bride...

479
00:49:42,205 --> 00:49:44,607
...riding bareback buck naked in the Sahara.

480
00:49:44,707 --> 00:49:48,345
I would watch my colonial tongue if I were you.

481
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:52,404
Hello, Jack.
And how's our lovely patient today?

482
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:56,279
Well, frankly, Arthur,
I'm confounded.

483
00:49:56,487 --> 00:49:59,189
Jack, are you still brooding over Miss Lucy?

484
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:02,860
I can only conclude it must be something mental.

485
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,327
How very droll.
Did you hear that, Quince?

486
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:11,402
Last week he wanted to marry her, and
now he wants to have her committed.

487
00:50:11,502 --> 00:50:13,502
Let's have a look at her.

488
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:26,650
I'm at a loss, I admit.

489
00:50:26,851 --> 00:50:29,521
I've taken the liberty of cabling Abraham Van Helsing...

490
00:50:29,621 --> 00:50:31,623
...the metaphysician, philosopher.

491
00:50:31,723 --> 00:50:34,592
Sounds like a goddamn witch doctor to me, Jack.

492
00:50:34,692 --> 00:50:38,563
Van Helsing knows more about obscure
diseases than any man in the world.

493
00:50:38,663 --> 00:50:40,823
He's my teacher and mentor.

494
00:50:43,768 --> 00:50:47,205
Do it, man.
Bring him here.

495
00:50:47,406 --> 00:50:49,406
Spare no expense.

496
00:51:24,177 --> 00:51:25,912
Astounding.

497
00:51:26,012 --> 00:51:28,776
There are no limits to science.

498
00:51:31,051 --> 00:51:33,451
How can you call this science?

499
00:51:34,688 --> 00:51:37,724
Do you think Madam Curie would invite such comparisons?

500
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:39,824
Really.

501
00:51:43,397 --> 00:51:45,831
I shouldn't have come here.

502
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:48,033
I must go.

503
00:51:53,207 --> 00:51:55,207
Do not fear me.

504
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:11,994
Stop this.

505
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:14,094
Stop this.

506
00:52:24,006 --> 00:52:26,566
My God. Who are you?

507
00:52:26,775 --> 00:52:28,510
I know you.

508
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:33,104
I have crossed oceans of time...

509
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:35,315
...to find you.

510
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,371
There is no need to panic.

511
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:21,213
The animal handlers have everything under complete control.

512
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:42,218
Come here, Mina.

513
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:03,507
He likes you.

514
00:54:29,335 --> 00:54:32,567
There is much to be learned from beasts.

515
00:55:45,781 --> 00:55:48,016
The tropical pampas vampire bat must...

516
00:55:48,116 --> 00:55:52,855
...consume ten times its own weight in fresh blood each day...

517
00:55:52,955 --> 00:55:55,755
...or its own blood cells will die.

518
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:06,667
Cute little vermin, ja?

519
00:56:07,737 --> 00:56:10,373
Blood and the diseases of the blood...

520
00:56:10,473 --> 00:56:13,753
...such as syphilis,
they concern us here.

521
00:56:14,344 --> 00:56:16,679
The very name 'venereal diseases'...

522
00:56:16,779 --> 00:56:20,483
...the diseases of Venus,
imputes to them divine origin.

523
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:24,053
And they are involved in that sex problem about which...

524
00:56:24,153 --> 00:56:28,259
...the ethics and ideals of Christian civilization are concerned.

525
00:56:28,359 --> 00:56:33,399
In fact, civilization and syphilization have advanced together.

526
00:56:36,534 --> 00:56:39,303
What is this?
- It's from the telegraph, Professor.

527
00:56:39,403 --> 00:56:41,403
Telegraph?

528
00:56:44,475 --> 00:56:48,395
Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.
That will be all.

529
00:56:58,557 --> 00:57:00,582
Dawn.

530
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,695
These may be the last words I write in this journal.

531
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,498
Dracula has left me with these women...

532
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:08,758
...these devils of the pit.

533
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:11,036
They drain my blood to keep me weak...

534
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,936
...barely alive so I cannot escape.

535
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:17,409
I will try one last time today to escape to the water.

536
00:57:17,509 --> 00:57:20,412
There must be passageway to the river...

537
00:57:20,512 --> 00:57:22,982
...and then away from this cursed land...

538
00:57:23,082 --> 00:57:28,282
...where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet.

539
00:57:36,529 --> 00:57:38,698
For the record, I do attest...

540
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:42,068
that at this point,
I, Abraham Van Helsing...

541
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:46,488
...became personally involved in these strange events.

542
00:58:40,061 --> 00:58:43,741
Professor Van Helsing,
how good of you to come.

543
00:58:47,669 --> 00:58:51,106
I always come to my friends in need when they call me.

544
00:58:51,206 --> 00:58:53,676
So, Jack, tell me everything about your case.

545
00:58:53,776 --> 00:58:56,712
She has all the usual physical anemic signs.

546
00:58:56,812 --> 00:59:00,015
Her blood analyzes normal,
and yet it is not.

547
00:59:00,115 --> 00:59:03,719
She manifests continued blood loss.
I cannot trace the cause.

548
00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:05,819
Blood loss? How?

549
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:17,098
My God, close the doors.

550
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:29,145
My God...

551
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:31,304
...she's only a child.

552
00:59:32,982 --> 00:59:34,982
Ja.

553
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:37,752
My God.

554
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:41,925
There's no time to lose.
There must be a transfusion at once.

555
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:44,694
Take off your coat.
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?

556
00:59:44,794 --> 00:59:47,231
Or have you forgotten?
- You perfected a procedure?

557
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:49,800
Perfected? No.
I've only experimented.

558
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,900
Landsteiner's method.

559
00:59:53,637 --> 00:59:55,798
Animals, goats, sheeps.

560
00:59:57,508 --> 00:59:59,443
If hemolysis occurs in the blood donor serum...

561
00:59:59,543 --> 01:00:01,278
...her red blood cells will explode.

562
01:00:01,378 --> 01:00:03,676
She will die.
Take this tube.

563
01:00:07,685 --> 01:00:09,854
What in God's name is going on up here?

564
01:00:09,954 --> 01:00:11,856
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

565
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:14,426
What the hell is he doing to Lucy?
- He's trying to save her life.

566
01:00:14,526 --> 01:00:17,486
Good God.
- You're the fiancé? Please.

567
01:00:20,532 --> 01:00:23,635
Take off your coat.
This young lady's very ill. She's dying.

568
01:00:23,735 --> 01:00:25,804
She wants blood and blood she must have.

569
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:27,305
Take off your coat.

570
01:00:27,405 --> 01:00:29,405
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

571
01:00:30,675 --> 01:00:32,939
Oh, God.
- Quickly, quickly.

572
01:00:33,145 --> 01:00:34,746
Roll it up.

573
01:00:34,846 --> 01:00:37,086
This may hurt a little, Art.

574
01:00:48,361 --> 01:00:51,931
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would
give my last drop of blood to save her.

575
01:00:52,031 --> 01:00:54,031
Your last drop?

576
01:00:54,116 --> 01:00:55,768
Thank you.

577
01:00:55,868 --> 01:01:00,306
You are very welcome here.
I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.

578
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,406
Hold her hand.

579
01:01:14,388 --> 01:01:18,792
Jack, that poor creature has had the
blood of two men put into her already.

580
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:23,372
Man alive. Her whole body couldn't hold that much blood.

581
01:01:25,566 --> 01:01:29,886
What took it out?
- That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

582
01:01:34,374 --> 01:01:36,343
Those marks on her throat...

583
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,879
...no disease, no trituration...

584
01:01:38,979 --> 01:01:40,882
...I am sure the blood loss occurred there.

585
01:01:40,982 --> 01:01:43,142
Oh? Where did the blood go?

586
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:46,788
You were once a careful student, Jack.

587
01:01:46,888 --> 01:01:48,790
Use your brain.
Where did the blood go?

588
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:50,890
Tell me.

589
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:53,695
The bed would be covered in blood.
- Exactly.

590
01:01:53,795 --> 01:01:56,264
You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear...

591
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:58,700
...that which you cannot account for.

592
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:03,920
Something just went up there,
sucked it out of her and flew away?

593
01:02:04,339 --> 01:02:06,174
Ja. Why not?

594
01:02:06,274 --> 01:02:10,473
That's brilliant.
That's absolutely brilliant.

595
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:12,848
Will one of you learned doctors,
or whatever you are...

596
01:02:12,948 --> 01:02:16,185
...kindly tell me what is going on with my Lucy?

597
01:02:16,285 --> 01:02:18,845
Jack, you are a scientist.

598
01:02:19,054 --> 01:02:22,458
Do you not think there are things in
this universe you cannot understand...

599
01:02:22,558 --> 01:02:25,094
...and which are true.
Mesmerism, hypnotism?

600
01:02:25,194 --> 01:02:27,329
You and Charcot have proved hypnotism.

601
01:02:27,429 --> 01:02:29,909
Materialization, astral bodies.

602
01:02:38,642 --> 01:02:40,642
Professor?

603
01:02:42,145 --> 01:02:44,145
Where did he go?

604
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:48,583
You see?

605
01:02:48,651 --> 01:02:51,054
I feel like a blundering novice.

606
01:02:51,154 --> 01:02:54,758
Gentlemen, we're not fighting some disease here.

607
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:56,927
Those marks on your dear Miss Lucy's neck were made...

608
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,229
...by something unspeakable out there.

609
01:02:59,329 --> 01:03:00,564
Dead, but not dead.

610
01:03:00,664 --> 01:03:03,800
It stalks us for some dread purpose I do not comprehend.

611
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,038
To live, it feeds on Lucy's precious blood.

612
01:03:07,138 --> 01:03:09,538
It is a beast, a monster.

613
01:03:28,292 --> 01:03:31,284
What is happening to Lucy and to me?

614
01:03:31,495 --> 01:03:34,733
When I was younger,
my feelings were never troubled.

615
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:37,153
I wish I were myself again...

616
01:03:37,302 --> 01:03:40,965
...the sensible Mina I always depended on.

617
01:03:47,479 --> 01:03:49,479
Absinthe...

618
01:03:49,681 --> 01:03:52,401
...is the aphrodisiac of the self.

619
01:03:53,986 --> 01:03:56,511
The green fairy...

620
01:03:56,722 --> 01:04:01,421
...who lives in the absinthe...

621
01:04:01,627 --> 01:04:03,627
...wants your soul.

622
01:04:06,432 --> 01:04:08,432
But...

623
01:04:09,068 --> 01:04:12,060
...you are safe with me.

624
01:04:26,853 --> 01:04:29,083
Tell me, Prince...

625
01:04:29,288 --> 01:04:31,314
...tell me of your home.

626
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:36,122
The most beautiful place...

627
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,330
...in all creation.

628
01:04:39,066 --> 01:04:42,900
Yes, it must be.

629
01:04:46,573 --> 01:04:50,737
A land beyond a great, vast forest...

630
01:04:53,447 --> 01:04:56,487
...surrounded by majestic mountains...

631
01:04:57,951 --> 01:04:59,952
...lush vineyards...

632
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:06,384
...and flowers of such frailty and beauty...

633
01:05:06,594 --> 01:05:09,074
...as to be found nowhere else.

634
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,809
You've described my home...

635
01:05:20,909 --> 01:05:23,709
...as if you had seen it firsthand.

636
01:05:27,183 --> 01:05:30,209
It's your voice, perhaps.

637
01:05:30,419 --> 01:05:32,419
It's so familiar.

638
01:05:34,323 --> 01:05:36,323
It's like...

639
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:41,340
It's like a voice in a dream I cannot place...

640
01:05:43,332 --> 01:05:45,892
...and it comforts me.

641
01:05:46,102 --> 01:05:49,062
When I am alone.
- When you are alone.

642
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,519
And what of the princess?

643
01:06:19,402 --> 01:06:20,971
Princess?

644
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:23,391
There is always a princess...

645
01:06:25,143 --> 01:06:27,543
...with gowns flowing white.

646
01:06:31,782 --> 01:06:34,808
And her face.

647
01:06:35,019 --> 01:06:37,988
Oh, God...

648
01:06:38,189 --> 01:06:40,189
...her face...

649
01:06:43,828 --> 01:06:45,828
...is a river.

650
01:06:50,868 --> 01:06:52,869
The princess...

651
01:06:53,872 --> 01:06:57,712
...she's a river filled with tears of sadness...

652
01:06:58,744 --> 01:07:00,744
...and heartbreak.

653
01:07:04,917 --> 01:07:06,917
There was a princess.

654
01:07:10,422 --> 01:07:12,422
Elisabeta.

655
01:07:15,027 --> 01:07:16,962
She was the most radiant woman...

656
01:07:17,062 --> 01:07:19,862
...in all the empires of the world.

657
01:07:26,673 --> 01:07:30,353
Man's deceit took her from her ancient prince.

658
01:07:32,445 --> 01:07:35,209
She leapt to her death...

659
01:07:35,415 --> 01:07:38,295
...into the river that you spoke of.

660
01:07:38,885 --> 01:07:41,786
In my mother's tongue...

661
01:07:43,289 --> 01:07:45,289
...it is called...

662
01:07:46,492 --> 01:07:48,517
...argesh.

663
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:52,831
River princess.

664
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:30,367
Dear Madam.

665
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:33,403
Your fiancé is safe and in the care...

666
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:37,343
...of the good sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.

667
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:41,874
Mr. Harker believes your life is in extreme danger...

668
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:45,516
...and he desires with all urgency that you join him here...

669
01:09:45,616 --> 01:09:48,786
...so that you may immediately be married.

670
01:09:48,886 --> 01:09:52,481
Yours with all blessings,
Sister Agatha.

671
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,787
My sweet prince.

672
01:09:57,995 --> 01:10:00,589
Jonathan must never know of us.

673
01:10:11,642 --> 01:10:13,078
Dr. Van Helsing.

674
01:10:13,178 --> 01:10:16,382
And you're Madam Mina,
dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

675
01:10:16,482 --> 01:10:19,718
How is she, doctor?
- She's still very weak.

676
01:10:19,818 --> 01:10:22,121
She tells me of your beloved Jonathan Harker...

677
01:10:22,221 --> 01:10:24,301
...and your worry for him.

678
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:27,770
Well, I, too, worry for all young lovers.

679
01:10:31,196 --> 01:10:33,832
There are darknesses in life,
my child...

680
01:10:33,932 --> 01:10:35,957
...and there are lights.

681
01:10:36,168 --> 01:10:39,004
You are one of the lights,
dear Mina...

682
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:41,185
...the light of all light.

683
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:48,679
Go now.
See your friend.

684
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,136
You look different.

685
01:11:12,339 --> 01:11:15,399
You look positively radiant.

686
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:17,111
You heard from Jonathan.

687
01:11:17,211 --> 01:11:19,338
Didn't you?
- Yes.

688
01:11:21,015 --> 01:11:23,015
He's safe.

689
01:11:23,217 --> 01:11:25,845
He's in a convent in Romania.

690
01:11:26,053 --> 01:11:29,420
He's suffering from a violent brain fever.

691
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:31,359
The good sisters are caring for him.

692
01:11:31,459 --> 01:11:35,987
They wrote to me,
and they say he needs me...

693
01:11:36,197 --> 01:11:39,190
...but I won't go.

694
01:11:39,401 --> 01:11:41,596
I'm not going to leave you.

695
01:11:43,972 --> 01:11:46,372
You've got to go to him...

696
01:11:46,575 --> 01:11:49,135
...and you've got to love him...

697
01:11:49,244 --> 01:11:52,284
...and marry him right then and there.

698
01:11:52,714 --> 01:11:56,480
And I want you to take this,
my sister.

699
01:11:56,685 --> 01:11:58,925
It's my wedding gift to you.

700
01:12:00,689 --> 01:12:03,729
Don't worry about spoiled little Lucy.

701
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,827
I'll be all right.

702
01:12:08,498 --> 01:12:10,989
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

703
01:12:25,982 --> 01:12:27,982
Jack, how is she?

704
01:12:46,703 --> 01:12:49,536
This is why I cannot breathe.

705
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,740
Lucy, it's medicinal.

706
01:12:51,824 --> 01:12:54,144
To help you sleep.
To dream better dreams.

707
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:57,314
It's garlic.
It's nothing but common garlic.

708
01:12:57,414 --> 01:13:00,774
Quincey's here to see you.
Get some brandy.

709
01:13:00,846 --> 01:13:04,447
Now, Miss Lucy,
you just rest easy.

710
01:13:04,656 --> 01:13:07,456
Arthur sent me to take care of you.

711
01:13:07,692 --> 01:13:09,127
He said if you don't get better quick...

712
01:13:09,227 --> 01:13:13,867
...I have to put you out of your misery like a lame horse.

713
01:13:15,233 --> 01:13:17,633
You're such a beast.

714
01:13:20,972 --> 01:13:22,972
Will you kiss me?

715
01:13:25,977 --> 01:13:28,377
Kiss me.

716
01:13:35,921 --> 01:13:39,789
That old coot.
- Get off me.

717
01:13:39,992 --> 01:13:43,359
Listen to me.
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

718
01:13:46,498 --> 01:13:48,498
You're at peace.

719
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:52,433
Look. There. There.

720
01:13:56,108 --> 01:13:58,108
Nosferatu.

721
01:14:11,358 --> 01:14:13,994
'Here occurs the shocking and frightening history...

722
01:14:14,094 --> 01:14:17,962
...of the wild,
berserk Prince Dracula.

723
01:14:18,164 --> 01:14:20,467
How he impaled people and roasted them...

724
01:14:20,567 --> 01:14:22,202
...boiled their heads in a kettle...

725
01:14:22,302 --> 01:14:24,638
...how he skinned them alive...

726
01:14:24,738 --> 01:14:29,299
...and hacked them to pieces and then drank their blood.'

727
01:14:32,747 --> 01:14:34,977
Dracul.

728
01:14:35,182 --> 01:14:37,673
For blood is the life.

729
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:56,766
'My dearest Prince, forgive me.

730
01:14:56,972 --> 01:15:00,576
I have received word from my fiancé in Romania.

731
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:04,436
I am en route to join him.
We are to be married.

732
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,371
I will never see you again.

733
01:15:07,582 --> 01:15:09,582
Mina. ”

734
01:15:19,027 --> 01:15:21,427
It is odd,
but I feel almost...

735
01:15:21,495 --> 01:15:24,132
...that my strange friend is with me.

736
01:15:24,232 --> 01:15:27,031
He speaks to me in my thoughts.

737
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:30,340
With him I felt more alive than ever I had.

738
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:33,376
And now without him,
soon to be a bride...

739
01:15:33,476 --> 01:15:36,138
...I feel confused and lost.

740
01:15:36,345 --> 01:15:40,304
Perhaps, though I try to be good,
I am bad.

741
01:15:40,516 --> 01:15:43,451
Perhaps I am a bad,
inconstant woman.

742
01:16:01,672 --> 01:16:03,902
Winds.

743
01:16:14,885 --> 01:16:16,978
It is the cause.

744
01:16:17,187 --> 01:16:19,815
It is the cause of my soul.

745
01:16:20,023 --> 01:16:21,458
It is Dracula...

746
01:16:21,558 --> 01:16:23,618
...the undead...

747
01:16:23,828 --> 01:16:26,868
...the foe I have pursued all my life.

748
01:16:30,835 --> 01:16:32,835
Dracula.

749
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:38,420
Jack, hurry.
I have much to tell you.

750
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:42,447
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

751
01:16:42,547 --> 01:16:44,913
Do not fail here tonight.

752
01:16:45,116 --> 01:16:48,119
We are dealing with forces beyond all human experience...

753
01:16:48,219 --> 01:16:50,288
...an enormous power,
so guard her well.

754
01:16:50,388 --> 01:16:54,060
Otherwise your precious Lucy will become a bitch of the devil...

755
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,160
...a whore of darkness.

756
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:00,110
You're a sick old buzzard.

757
01:17:01,133 --> 01:17:03,133
Hear me out, young man.

758
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:05,671
Lucy is not a random victim attacked by mere accident.

759
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:07,406
Do you understand? No.

760
01:17:07,506 --> 01:17:11,677
She is a willing recruit,
a breathless, wanton follower.

761
01:17:11,777 --> 01:17:14,257
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

762
01:17:14,446 --> 01:17:16,880
She is the devil's concubine.

763
01:17:18,684 --> 01:17:20,685
Do you understand me?

764
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:24,785
Yet, we may still save her precious soul.

765
01:17:24,991 --> 01:17:28,620
But not on an empty stomach.

766
01:17:28,829 --> 01:17:30,990
Jack.
- Here, sir.

767
01:17:31,198 --> 01:17:33,894
I starve. Feed me.

768
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:37,001
You old coot.

769
01:19:51,543 --> 01:19:54,813
Your impotent men with their foolish spells...

770
01:19:54,913 --> 01:19:58,974
...cannot protect you from my power.

771
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:14,866
I condemn you to living death...

772
01:20:15,067 --> 01:20:18,161
...to eternal hunger...

773
01:20:18,371 --> 01:20:22,603
...for living blood.

774
01:21:56,171 --> 01:22:00,209
I know how deeply you loved her. That
is why you must trust me and believe.

775
01:22:00,309 --> 01:22:02,402
Believe?
How can I believe?

776
01:22:02,611 --> 01:22:06,383
I want you to bring me, before nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.

777
01:22:06,483 --> 01:22:08,483
An autopsy? Lucy?

778
01:22:08,651 --> 01:22:14,411
No, not exactly. I just want to cut
off her head and take out her heart.

779
01:22:20,196 --> 01:22:23,029
Diary, 17th September.

780
01:22:23,233 --> 01:22:26,794
Poor Jonathan.
He's still so ill.

781
01:22:27,003 --> 01:22:30,306
He's cheered by the familiar streets in London.

782
01:22:30,406 --> 01:22:34,647
For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.

783
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:38,315
It is as if a part of me is dead too...

784
01:22:38,415 --> 01:22:41,252
...except for the tiny hope that lives in me...

785
01:22:41,352 --> 01:22:43,888
...that I will again see my prince.

786
01:22:43,988 --> 01:22:45,988
Is he here?

787
01:22:46,056 --> 01:22:47,591
Now that I am married...

788
01:22:47,691 --> 01:22:51,829
...I begin to understand the nature of
my feelings for my strange friend...

789
01:22:51,929 --> 01:22:54,489
...who is always in my thoughts.

790
01:23:05,377 --> 01:23:07,402
Jonathan, what is it?

791
01:23:07,612 --> 01:23:09,612
It is the man himself.

792
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,775
Look, he's grown young.

793
01:23:55,394 --> 01:23:59,832
Gentlemen, must we desecrate poor Lucy's grave?

794
01:24:00,033 --> 01:24:02,033
She died horribly enough.

795
01:24:04,638 --> 01:24:07,741
If Miss Lucy is dead,
then no wrong can be done to her.

796
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:10,332
But if she's not dead...

797
01:24:10,544 --> 01:24:13,013
What are you saying, man?
That she's been buried alive?

798
01:24:13,113 --> 01:24:18,073
No. All I say is she is undead.

799
01:24:19,086 --> 01:24:20,487
Undead.

800
01:24:20,587 --> 01:24:22,587
This is insane.

801
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:43,770
Gentlemen, shall we?

802
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:46,913
One, two, three.

803
01:25:03,799 --> 01:25:05,799
Where is she?

804
01:25:10,139 --> 01:25:13,040
What have you done with her?

805
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:15,411
She lives beyond the grace of God...

806
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:17,746
...a wanderer in the outer darkness.

807
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:21,714
She is vampyre, nosferatu.

808
01:25:21,917 --> 01:25:24,921
These creatures do not die like the bee after the first sting...

809
01:25:25,021 --> 01:25:27,424
...but instead grow strong and become immortal...

810
01:25:27,524 --> 01:25:30,564
...once infected by another nosferatu.

811
01:25:35,265 --> 01:25:38,101
So my friends,
we fight not one beast...

812
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:41,638
...but legions that go on age after age after age...

813
01:25:41,738 --> 01:25:44,778
...feeding on the blood of the living.

814
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:52,447
Quickly, hide. Now.

815
01:26:29,454 --> 01:26:32,548
Come to me, Arthur.

816
01:26:32,758 --> 01:26:35,784
Leave these others and come to me.

817
01:26:37,796 --> 01:26:40,836
My arms are hungry for you,
my darling.

818
01:26:40,999 --> 01:26:44,491
Kiss me and caress me...

819
01:26:44,703 --> 01:26:47,103
...my darling husband, please.

820
01:26:47,188 --> 01:26:49,909
We wave Christ and His holy blood.

821
01:26:49,985 --> 01:26:54,225
We are strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

822
01:26:57,183 --> 01:26:59,423
The power of God is upon us.

823
01:27:11,164 --> 01:27:13,964
I bring you from shadow into light.

824
01:27:14,015 --> 01:27:17,215
I cast you out,
the prince of darkness...

825
01:27:17,236 --> 01:27:19,236
...into hell.

826
01:27:21,775 --> 01:27:23,877
A moment's courage,
and it is done.

827
01:27:23,977 --> 01:27:26,777
Take the stake in your left hand...

828
01:27:28,081 --> 01:27:30,801
...place the point over the heart.

829
01:27:34,621 --> 01:27:37,581
Then in God's name, strike.
Do it now.

830
01:27:52,707 --> 01:27:57,701
Eat, feast. You'll need your strength for the dark days ahead.

831
01:28:00,882 --> 01:28:03,407
Doctor?
- Ja?

832
01:28:03,618 --> 01:28:05,618
How did Lucy die?

833
01:28:08,389 --> 01:28:10,389
Well...

834
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:12,961
Was she in great pain?

835
01:28:13,061 --> 01:28:15,765
Ja, she was in great pain.
Then we cut off her head...

836
01:28:15,865 --> 01:28:19,101
...drove a stake through her heart and
burned it and then she found peace.

837
01:28:19,201 --> 01:28:22,466
Doctor. Please.

838
01:28:26,008 --> 01:28:28,169
So, Mr. Harker...

839
01:28:28,377 --> 01:28:31,497
...I must now ask you,
as your doctor...

840
01:28:34,149 --> 01:28:35,951
...a sensitive question.

841
01:28:36,051 --> 01:28:38,621
During your infidelity with those creatures...

842
01:28:38,721 --> 01:28:40,289
...those demonic women...

843
01:28:40,389 --> 01:28:44,310
...did you, for one instant,
taste of their blood?

844
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:56,640
Good.

845
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:59,309
Then you have not infected your blood with the terrible...

846
01:28:59,409 --> 01:29:02,289
...disease that destroyed poor Lucy.

847
01:29:10,353 --> 01:29:12,914
Doctor, you must understand.

848
01:29:14,659 --> 01:29:17,025
I doubted everything...

849
01:29:17,228 --> 01:29:18,896
...even my mind.

850
01:29:18,996 --> 01:29:20,996
I was impotent with fear.

851
01:29:21,198 --> 01:29:23,928
I know.
- But, sir...

852
01:29:24,135 --> 01:29:27,866
...I know where the bastard sleeps.

853
01:29:28,072 --> 01:29:31,701
I brought him there,
to Carfax Abbey.

854
01:29:34,478 --> 01:29:38,073
Vampires do exist.

855
01:29:38,282 --> 01:29:41,420
And this one we fight,
this one we face...

856
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,089
...has the strength of 20 or more people...

857
01:29:44,189 --> 01:29:46,258
...and you can testify for that,
Mr. Harker.

858
01:29:46,358 --> 01:29:49,495
But he can also control the meaner things of life...

859
01:29:49,595 --> 01:29:51,697
...the bat, the rodent, the wolf.

860
01:29:51,797 --> 01:29:56,437
He can appear as mist, as vapor,
as fog and vanish at will.

861
01:29:56,568 --> 01:29:58,637
Now, all these things Dracula can do...

862
01:29:58,737 --> 01:30:00,439
...but he is not free.

863
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:03,942
He must rest in the sacred earth of
his homeland to gain his evil power.

864
01:30:04,042 --> 01:30:07,946
It is here that we must find him and destroy him utterly.

865
01:30:08,046 --> 01:30:11,084
I almost feel pity for anything so hunted as this count.

866
01:30:11,184 --> 01:30:13,824
How can you pity such a creature?

867
01:30:15,188 --> 01:30:16,623
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

868
01:30:16,723 --> 01:30:19,123
Good. You'll be safer there.

869
01:30:21,861 --> 01:30:24,230
Mr. Morris, your bullets will not harm him.

870
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:27,734
He must be beheaded.
I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

871
01:30:27,834 --> 01:30:31,914
Well, I wasn't planning on getting that close, Doc.

872
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:33,993
Master.

873
01:30:50,324 --> 01:30:52,485
Dr. Jack.

874
01:30:52,693 --> 01:30:55,560
I've been promised eternal life.

875
01:30:58,265 --> 01:31:00,505
Dr. Seward, who is that man?

876
01:31:00,701 --> 01:31:03,270
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you,
Madam Mina.

877
01:31:03,370 --> 01:31:06,465
Renfield? I must see him.

878
01:31:07,676 --> 01:31:11,077
Mr. Renfield, behave yourself.

879
01:31:13,515 --> 01:31:15,515
This is Mrs. Harker.

880
01:31:17,185 --> 01:31:20,916
Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

881
01:31:21,122 --> 01:31:23,842
It seems I've been rather naughty.

882
01:31:26,294 --> 01:31:28,294
I know you.

883
01:31:28,362 --> 01:31:31,082
You're the bride my master covets.

884
01:31:32,801 --> 01:31:35,430
I have a husband.

885
01:31:35,638 --> 01:31:37,638
I am Mrs. Harker.

886
01:31:38,507 --> 01:31:41,305
My master tells me about you.

887
01:31:42,478 --> 01:31:44,478
What does he tell you?

888
01:31:44,914 --> 01:31:46,914
That he is coming.

889
01:31:48,217 --> 01:31:50,297
That he is coming for you.

890
01:31:51,353 --> 01:31:53,353
Oh, please.

891
01:31:59,495 --> 01:32:01,495
Don't stay here.

892
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:06,494
Get away from these men, please.

893
01:32:07,904 --> 01:32:12,384
And I pray to God I may never see your sweet face again.

894
01:32:15,479 --> 01:32:18,359
And may the Lord bless and keep you.

895
01:32:29,326 --> 01:32:32,990
Master. Master.

896
01:32:33,197 --> 01:32:35,791
You promised me eternal life...

897
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,420
...but you give it to the pretty woman.

898
01:32:39,537 --> 01:32:41,537
Dr. Jack.

899
01:32:41,706 --> 01:32:43,706
I'm no lunatic man.

900
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:46,768
I'm a sane man fighting for his soul.

901
01:32:46,878 --> 01:32:50,815
My quarters are spare, but I think you will find them comfortable.

902
01:32:50,915 --> 01:32:52,915
Dr. Jack.

903
01:32:52,966 --> 01:32:56,006
Water and toiletries at your disposal.

904
01:32:58,022 --> 01:33:00,503
You'll be completely safe here.

905
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:06,190
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

906
01:34:06,293 --> 01:34:08,293
Leave him no refuge.

907
01:34:08,529 --> 01:34:10,759
Let the exorcism begin.

908
01:34:40,195 --> 01:34:43,187
You have betrayed me.

909
01:34:47,202 --> 01:34:49,202
No, master.

910
01:34:53,376 --> 01:34:55,606
I serve you.

911
01:34:55,811 --> 01:34:58,644
I serve only you.

912
01:35:56,107 --> 01:35:59,201
Oh, yes, my love.

913
01:35:59,410 --> 01:36:01,776
You've found me.

914
01:36:05,016 --> 01:36:07,382
My most precious life.

915
01:36:07,585 --> 01:36:10,611
I have wanted this to happen.

916
01:36:10,822 --> 01:36:12,822
I know that now.

917
01:36:14,559 --> 01:36:17,995
I want to be with you always.

918
01:36:18,196 --> 01:36:22,691
You cannot know what you are saying.

919
01:36:22,901 --> 01:36:24,901
Yes...

920
01:36:25,037 --> 01:36:27,096
...I do know.

921
01:36:40,019 --> 01:36:44,012
I feared I would never feel your touch again.

922
01:36:44,223 --> 01:36:46,223
I thought you were dead.

923
01:36:53,299 --> 01:36:57,326
There is no life in this body.

924
01:37:01,508 --> 01:37:03,508
But you live.

925
01:37:05,178 --> 01:37:07,178
You live.

926
01:37:08,782 --> 01:37:10,782
What are you?

927
01:37:12,018 --> 01:37:15,112
I must know.
You must tell me.

928
01:37:22,463 --> 01:37:24,463
I am...

929
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:28,064
...nothing.

930
01:37:28,269 --> 01:37:30,269
Lifeless.

931
01:37:31,639 --> 01:37:33,774
Soulless.
- What do you mean?

932
01:37:33,874 --> 01:37:36,741
Hated and feared.

933
01:37:37,978 --> 01:37:40,913
I am dead to all the world.

934
01:37:41,115 --> 01:37:43,115
Hear me.

935
01:37:44,986 --> 01:37:47,011
I am the monster...

936
01:37:47,222 --> 01:37:49,862
...that breathing men would kill.

937
01:37:50,659 --> 01:37:53,219
I am Dracula.

938
01:38:09,044 --> 01:38:11,171
You murdered Lucy.

939
01:38:24,393 --> 01:38:26,393
I love you.

940
01:38:27,663 --> 01:38:32,032
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.

941
01:38:50,654 --> 01:38:53,248
I want to be what you are...

942
01:38:53,457 --> 01:38:54,858
...see what you see...

943
01:38:54,958 --> 01:38:56,958
...love what you love.

944
01:39:00,497 --> 01:39:02,988
To walk with me...

945
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:06,480
...you must die to your breathing life...

946
01:39:06,575 --> 01:39:09,665
...and be reborn to mine.

947
01:39:09,874 --> 01:39:13,037
You are my love...

948
01:39:13,244 --> 01:39:15,838
...and my life always.

949
01:39:23,855 --> 01:39:25,657
Then...

950
01:39:25,757 --> 01:39:28,123
...I give you life eternal...

951
01:39:29,928 --> 01:39:31,928
...everlasting love...

952
01:39:33,498 --> 01:39:37,264
...the power of the storm...

953
01:39:37,468 --> 01:39:41,064
...and the beasts of the earth.

954
01:39:41,273 --> 01:39:43,400
Walk with me...

955
01:39:43,609 --> 01:39:47,272
...to be my loving wife forever.

956
01:39:47,479 --> 01:39:50,209
I will. Yes. Yes.

957
01:40:21,314 --> 01:40:24,215
Drink and join me...

958
01:40:25,318 --> 01:40:27,752
...in eternal life.

959
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:45,037
I cannot let this be.

960
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:49,405
Please, I don't care.
Make me yours.

961
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:53,714
You will be cursed as I am to walk in the shadow of death...

962
01:40:53,814 --> 01:40:55,616
...for all eternity.

963
01:40:55,716 --> 01:41:00,415
I love you too much...

964
01:41:00,621 --> 01:41:02,089
...to condemn you.

965
01:41:02,189 --> 01:41:07,287
Then take me away from all this death.

966
01:42:04,588 --> 01:42:07,853
You think you can destroy me...

967
01:42:08,058 --> 01:42:10,356
...with your idols?

968
01:42:13,364 --> 01:42:15,958
Sacred blood of Christ.

969
01:42:16,166 --> 01:42:19,033
I, who served the cross.

970
01:42:19,236 --> 01:42:21,534
I, who commanded nations...

971
01:42:21,739 --> 01:42:24,808
...hundreds of years before you were born.

972
01:42:24,908 --> 01:42:26,988
Your armies were defeated.

973
01:42:27,083 --> 01:42:30,946
You tortured and impaled thousands of people.

974
01:42:31,149 --> 01:42:34,243
I was betrayed.

975
01:42:34,452 --> 01:42:37,353
Look what your God...

976
01:42:37,555 --> 01:42:40,251
...has done to me.

977
01:42:40,458 --> 01:42:45,178
No, your war with God is over.
You must pay for your crimes.

978
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:50,235
Christ compels you.

979
01:42:50,335 --> 01:42:53,793
She is now...

980
01:42:54,005 --> 01:42:57,237
...my bride.

981
01:43:01,947 --> 01:43:03,947
More light.

982
01:43:05,017 --> 01:43:08,316
Light. More light.

983
01:43:16,028 --> 01:43:18,028
Unclean.

984
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:21,567
Get them.
- This way.

985
01:43:21,667 --> 01:43:23,235
Get them.
- They must be found.

986
01:43:23,335 --> 01:43:24,403
Unclean.

987
01:43:24,503 --> 01:43:26,984
We have learned something much.

988
01:43:27,062 --> 01:43:30,737
Dracula fears us.
He fears time.

989
01:43:30,944 --> 01:43:34,004
For, if not,
why does he hurry so?

990
01:43:34,214 --> 01:43:36,910
He is gone.

991
01:43:37,117 --> 01:43:39,347
How do you know?

992
01:43:39,553 --> 01:43:42,283
He speaks to me.

993
01:43:43,423 --> 01:43:46,543
He has a strong mind connection to you.

994
01:43:47,961 --> 01:43:51,881
His heart was strong enough to survive the grave.

995
01:43:52,165 --> 01:43:55,226
You admire him.
- Ja.

996
01:43:55,436 --> 01:43:59,668
He was, in life,
a most remarkable man...

997
01:43:59,874 --> 01:44:02,643
...and his mind was great and powerful...

998
01:44:02,743 --> 01:44:05,747
...but greater is the necessity to stamp him out...

999
01:44:05,847 --> 01:44:08,007
...and destroy him utterly.

1000
01:44:08,883 --> 01:44:10,883
Doctor?
- Ja?

1001
01:44:13,855 --> 01:44:17,484
I know that I am becoming like him.

1002
01:44:17,692 --> 01:44:21,059
Your salvation is his destruction.

1003
01:44:21,262 --> 01:44:24,926
That is why I want to hypnotize you.

1004
01:44:25,133 --> 01:44:29,171
I want you to help me find him before it is too late.

1005
01:44:29,271 --> 01:44:32,729
Please, help me find him.
Please.

1006
01:44:32,941 --> 01:44:35,273
Look into this light...

1007
01:44:35,477 --> 01:44:38,837
...the light of all light,
into this flame.

1008
01:44:39,248 --> 01:44:41,248
Your eyes are heavy.

1009
01:44:42,851 --> 01:44:45,513
You want to sleep.
Sleep now.

1010
01:44:48,557 --> 01:44:52,324
Sleep.
- I must go to him.

1011
01:44:52,529 --> 01:44:54,827
He calls.

1012
01:44:55,031 --> 01:44:57,031
What do you hear?

1013
01:44:58,768 --> 01:45:01,168
What do you hear, child?

1014
01:45:02,272 --> 01:45:04,866
What do you hear?

1015
01:45:05,074 --> 01:45:09,101
Oh, my prince is calling me.

1016
01:45:09,312 --> 01:45:13,806
He is traveling across icy seas to his beloved home.

1017
01:45:14,017 --> 01:45:17,077
There he will grow strong again.

1018
01:45:17,287 --> 01:45:20,968
I am coming to him to partake of his strength.

1019
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:31,335
We left London by train and crossed
the English Channel in stormy seas...

1020
01:45:31,435 --> 01:45:34,538
...no doubt from the passage of the count's ship.

1021
01:45:34,638 --> 01:45:39,007
He commands the winds,
but we still have the advantage.

1022
01:45:39,209 --> 01:45:42,880
By train, we can reach the Romanian port at Varna in three days.

1023
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:46,340
By ship, it will take him at least a week.

1024
01:45:47,151 --> 01:45:50,255
From Paris, we traveled through the Alps to Budapest.

1025
01:45:50,355 --> 01:45:52,991
The count must sail around the Rock of Gibraltar...

1026
01:45:53,091 --> 01:45:54,893
...where we have posted a lookout...

1027
01:45:54,993 --> 01:45:57,829
...and then on to the Black Sea port in Varna...

1028
01:45:57,929 --> 01:46:02,409
...where we will meet his ship and burn it into the sea.

1029
01:46:07,305 --> 01:46:10,399
Home. Home.

1030
01:46:20,219 --> 01:46:22,989
The vampire's baptized her with his own blood...

1031
01:46:23,089 --> 01:46:25,224
...and her blood is dying,
my friend.

1032
01:46:25,324 --> 01:46:27,324
It is no use.

1033
01:46:39,639 --> 01:46:42,942
I will not let you go into the unknown alone.

1034
01:46:43,042 --> 01:46:47,241
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

1035
01:46:47,447 --> 01:46:50,109
Oh, what have I done to you?

1036
01:46:51,852 --> 01:46:54,980
No, I have done this to both of us.

1037
01:46:55,188 --> 01:46:57,457
I can hear him.
He's coming closer.

1038
01:46:57,557 --> 01:46:59,557
He's calling me to him.

1039
01:47:04,231 --> 01:47:06,597
Stay with me. Please.

1040
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,800
I am so cold.

1041
01:47:21,015 --> 01:47:22,450
All aboard.

1042
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:26,287
Noon. Holmwood received a wire from his clerk at Lloyd's.

1043
01:47:26,387 --> 01:47:29,457
The count's ship sailed past us in the night fog...

1044
01:47:29,557 --> 01:47:31,459
...to the northern port of Galatz.

1045
01:47:31,559 --> 01:47:34,687
The black devil is reading Mina's mind.

1046
01:47:34,896 --> 01:47:37,364
How can we catch him now?

1047
01:47:45,374 --> 01:47:47,774
Varna. Galatz.

1048
01:47:47,976 --> 01:47:49,678
It's about 200 miles.

1049
01:47:49,778 --> 01:47:52,014
I think that with the horses,
we can cut him off...

1050
01:47:52,114 --> 01:47:54,049
...reach him before he reaches the castle.

1051
01:47:54,149 --> 01:47:57,186
I will dispatch Van Helsing straight for the Borgo Pass.

1052
01:47:57,286 --> 01:47:58,854
If we fail in our task...

1053
01:47:58,954 --> 01:48:01,434
...you will have to finish him.

1054
01:48:05,728 --> 01:48:09,064
From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing took a carriage...

1055
01:48:09,164 --> 01:48:11,935
...and we continued on the train towards Galatz...

1056
01:48:12,035 --> 01:48:15,905
...where we still hoped to intercept the count before he reaches land.

1057
01:48:16,005 --> 01:48:20,704
I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.

1058
01:48:33,189 --> 01:48:35,025
I know this place.

1059
01:48:35,125 --> 01:48:37,894
The end of the world.
- We must go on.

1060
01:48:37,994 --> 01:48:39,897
It is late, child.
We must rest here now.

1061
01:48:39,997 --> 01:48:42,431
No, we must go.

1062
01:48:42,633 --> 01:48:44,633
He needs me.
We must go.

1063
01:48:48,773 --> 01:48:50,773
We have passed Bistritza.

1064
01:48:50,841 --> 01:48:53,436
Dracula has outsmarted us again.

1065
01:48:53,644 --> 01:48:57,448
We learned that his gypsies took charge
of the vampire's box at Galatz...

1066
01:48:57,548 --> 01:49:01,075
...and are now on the Borgo Pass road.

1067
01:49:17,035 --> 01:49:20,471
Here. You must eat.
- I am not hungry.

1068
01:50:12,693 --> 01:50:15,733
You have been so good to me,
Professor.

1069
01:50:25,272 --> 01:50:29,192
I know that Lucy harbored secret desires for you.

1070
01:50:29,309 --> 01:50:31,641
She told me.

1071
01:50:31,845 --> 01:50:34,838
I, too, know what men desire.

1072
01:50:51,532 --> 01:50:53,468
Will you cut off my head...

1073
01:50:53,568 --> 01:50:55,537
...and drive a stake through my heart...

1074
01:50:55,637 --> 01:50:59,317
...as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

1075
01:51:03,078 --> 01:51:06,518
Not while I live.
I am sworn to protect you.

1076
01:51:23,299 --> 01:51:25,779
You are safe within the circle.

1077
01:51:25,901 --> 01:51:29,359
I've lost Lucy.
I'll not lose you to him.

1078
01:51:29,571 --> 01:51:31,572
You're whores of Satan.

1079
01:51:35,178 --> 01:51:37,178
This is holy ground.

1080
01:51:37,314 --> 01:51:39,314
Leave this place now.

1081
01:51:41,151 --> 01:51:43,151
Leave.

1082
01:51:43,853 --> 01:51:46,656
In the name of God,
leave this ground.

1083
01:51:46,756 --> 01:51:49,636
I command you in the name of Christ.

1084
01:52:00,705 --> 01:52:03,606
Christ. Damn you.

1085
01:52:40,779 --> 01:52:42,779
Dracul.

1086
01:53:21,487 --> 01:53:23,487
You are...

1087
01:53:23,689 --> 01:53:25,954
...near.

1088
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:28,160
My love.

1089
01:53:40,174 --> 01:53:41,608
They're racing against the sunset.

1090
01:53:41,708 --> 01:53:44,188
It may be too late.
God help us.

1091
01:54:25,121 --> 01:54:27,121
Harker, shoot.

1092
01:54:35,264 --> 01:54:37,264
Charge.

1093
01:57:18,633 --> 01:57:22,313
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

1094
01:57:24,439 --> 01:57:26,439
Will you?

1095
01:57:32,013 --> 01:57:33,515
Wait.
- Let them go.

1096
01:57:33,615 --> 01:57:37,415
Let them go.
Our work is finished here.

1097
01:57:38,219 --> 01:57:40,220
Hers has just begun.

1098
01:58:04,046 --> 01:58:06,742
We've all become God's madmen.

1099
01:58:09,252 --> 01:58:11,252
All of us.

1100
01:58:20,464 --> 01:58:24,195
Where is my God?

1101
01:58:24,401 --> 01:58:27,564
He has forsaken me.

1102
01:58:33,844 --> 01:58:37,076
It is finished.

1103
01:58:39,150 --> 01:58:41,150
My love.

1104
01:58:45,423 --> 01:58:47,423
My love.

1105
01:58:55,099 --> 01:58:57,659
There, in the presence of God...

1106
01:58:57,731 --> 01:59:00,672
...I understood at last how my love could release us all...

1107
01:59:00,772 --> 01:59:03,252
...from the powers of darkness.

1108
01:59:08,981 --> 01:59:11,541
Our love is stronger than death.

1109
01:59:19,792 --> 01:59:22,659
Give me peace.

1110
01:59:23,305 --> 02:00:23,341
