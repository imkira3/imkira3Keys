1
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,139
Dad.

2
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,083
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
God be with you!

3
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:57,421
Port side stick, starboard side stick,
move fast and clear those murder holes.

4
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,840
I want to see plenty of beach
between men.

5
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,844
Five men is a juicy opportunity.
One man is a waste of ammo.

6
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,013
Keep the sand out of your weapons.

7
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,518
Keep those actions clear.
And I'll see you on the beach.

8
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,885
Clear the murder holes!

9
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,778
Over the side!

10
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,704
Port and starboard, over...

11
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,149
Jesus.

12
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,360
Thank you...

13
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,293
I said, what the hell do we do now, sir?

14
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,965
Captain Miller! Captain Miller!

15
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,803
-Captain Miller!
-Sergeant Horvath!

16
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:01,016
Move your men off the beach! Go!

17
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,434
Okay, you guys!

18
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,604
-Get on my ass! Follow me!
-Sir!

19
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,982
What's the rallying point?

20
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,900
Anywhere but here!

21
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,457
The seawall! Move up to the seawall!

22
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,835
Sir, I'm staying!

23
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,212
Clear this beach!
Make way for the others!

24
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,881
This is all we got
between us and the Almighty.

25
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:37,011
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted!

26
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,181
You stay here, you're dead men!

27
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,948
Mama! Mama!

28
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,080
Stay down! Stay down!

29
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,086
What are you guys?

30
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,881
104th Medical Battalion, sir!

31
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,633
Here to set up field operations!

32
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,260
Get rid of that crap!

33
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,430
Grab yourselves some weapons.
Follow me.

34
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,940
-I'm hit! I'm hit!
-Briggs!

35
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:40,491
Get me out of here. I'm hit low. God!

36
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,660
-Medic!
-Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

37
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,456
I gotta clear these obstacles,
make holes for the tanks.

38
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,875
All the armour is foundering
in the Channel.

39
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,212
Orders, sir. You go somewhere else.
I'm clearing this one!

40
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,089
Come on, Briggs!

41
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,053
Medic!

42
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,758
Move! Move!

43
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,561
Move! Come on! Move!

44
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,669
Shore party.
No armour has made it ashore.

45
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:20,466
We got no DD tanks on the beach.
Dog One is not open.

46
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:25,053
-Who's in command here?
-You are, sir!

47
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,141
-Sergeant Horvath!
-Sir!

48
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,268
You recognise where we are?

49
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,770
Right where we're supposed to be,
but no one else is!

50
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,316
Nobody's where they're supposed to be.

51
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,984
Shore party.

52
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,029
First wave, ineffective.

53
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:46,158
We do not hold the beach.
Say again, we do not hold the beach.

54
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,910
We're all mixed up, sir.

55
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,786
We got the leftovers from Fox Company,

56
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,830
Able Company and George Company!

57
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:55,542
Plus we got some Navy demo guys
and a beachmaster!

58
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,088
Shore party. Shore party.

59
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,514
CATF , CATF ...

60
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,311
-Reiben here, sir!
-Did you see anybody else?

61
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,189
-Jackson, but that's about it.
-Mellish here.

62
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,526
Caparzo! We got DeForest
back there with Wade.

63
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,363
He's hurt so bad he says
he sprung 100 leaks.

64
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,114
Wade says he's all used up.

65
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,450
-Move on to somebody you can help.
-Let's go!

66
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,994
He's battalion surgeon, sir!

67
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,000
-Get his attention.
-Wade!

68
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,585
-Yo, Doc!
-Wade!

69
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,838
-Wade! Wade! Wade!
-Wade!

70
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,176
-Wade! Wade! Wade!
-Too risky, Doc. Too risky.

71
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,721
-Wade!
-All right. Get him off the beach.

72
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,559
I got it! We stopped the bleeding!
We stopped the bleeding!

73
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,728
Fuck!

74
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,107
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

75
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,609
-Son of a fucking cocksucker!
-Wade! Come on. Come on.

76
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,904
Wade! It's Mellish! Wade!

77
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,115
-Mellish!
-Let's go!

78
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,366
We found Miller!

79
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,035
-Fuck it!
-Let's move! Let's move!

80
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,212
This is all? This is all that's made it?

81
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,799
We got scattered pretty bad, sir.
There's bound to be more.

82
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,136
-Not enough. It's not enough.
-Dog One exit...

83
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,596
It's gotta be that cut on the right.

84
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,181
-Or is that one on the left? Shit!
-No. No, no, no.

85
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,976
Vierville is to the west of us.
This is Dog One.

86
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,311
They're killing us!

87
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:41,523
And we don't have a fucking chance,
and that ain't fair!

88
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,902
Gather weapons and ammo!

89
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,072
Come on, let's drag them in
off the sand!

90
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,084
Reiben. Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben,
where's your BAR?

91
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,962
Bottom of the channel, sir.
The bitch tried to drown me.

92
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,922
Find a replacement.

93
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,927
Bangalores! Bring up some bangalores!

94
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,891
Grenades, grenades! Get me
some grenades. Get them over here!

95
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:22,564
Bangalores up the line!
Bangalores up the line!

96
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,941
Heads up! Bangers coming your way!

97
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,444
Come on, come on, come on!

98
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,364
-Jackson here, sir!
-Reiben back, sir!

99
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,784
Oh, my God!

100
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,247
One more. Give me one more.

101
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,297
Oh, my God, it hurts! I'm gonna die!

102
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:51,343
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus! Oh, my God!

103
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,889
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
Almost got it.

104
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,017
-Jesus! Lucky bastard.
-Come on.

105
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,187
-Move it!
-Keep it moving. You got it?

106
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,315
God! God, help me!

107
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,859
You're not gonna die.
You're not gonna die.

108
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:11,113
You're fine. Don't look at it.
Don't look at it.

109
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,950
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

110
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,703
-Fire in the hole!
-Fire in the hole!

111
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:23,250
Fire in the hole!

112
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:36,555
We're in business! Defilade!
Other side of the hole!

113
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,945
That's it! Let's go!

114
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,534
Inspected. Morphine.

115
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,788
Routine.

116
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,254
Priority.

117
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,468
He's gone.

118
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,648
Son of a...

119
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,068
-Get in there.
-Fuck. I can't move.

120
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,403
-Mellish.
-Yes, sir.

121
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,322
Give me your bayonet.

122
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,262
Two MG42s and two mortars.
Add 20, left 30.

123
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,101
There's a little defilade over there,
but it's the perfect fire position

124
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,937
if we get some goddamn armour
on the beach.

125
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:10,106
We gotta open up this draw!
We gotta get this draw open.

126
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,108
Reiben, Mellish, let's get into the war!

127
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,195
Grab some cover
and put some fire on that crew.

128
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,990
Davis, Debernardo,
Young, Valk, get ready.

129
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,036
Covering fire!

130
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,083
Go, go, go!

131
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,057
Goddamn firing squad.

132
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,352
It's the only way we can get
everybody the hell out of here.

133
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,648
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!
You're next!

134
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,359
Why don't we just hand out
blindfolds, Cap?

135
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,027
All we can do here is die.

136
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,696
Covering fire!

137
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,950
Go, go, go!

138
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,911
Come on! Come on! Come on!

139
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,913
Go, God damn it!

140
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,928
-Jackson.
-Sir.

141
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,723
-Do you see that impact crater?
-Yes, sir.

142
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,183
That should give you complete defilade
from that machine-gun position.

143
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,144
Get in there and give me
some fire discipline.

144
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,146
Wait for my command.

145
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,278
Go!

146
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,626
Captain, if your mother saw you do that,
she'd be very upset.

147
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,003
I thought you were my mother.

148
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,590
Be not thou far from me, O Lord.

149
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:07,140
O my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

150
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,602
I detest my sins
for having offended thee, O Lord.

151
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,228
I detest my sins for having
offended thee, O Lord.

152
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,356
Listen to me, Lord.

153
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:23,198
All my strength, haste thee to help me.

154
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:44,010
-Dog One exit! Right here!
-We're in business!

155
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,389
Move! Move!

156
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,348
-Reiben.
-Let's go, Sarge. Go!

157
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,725
Reiben.

158
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:59,044
The place is full of 'em!

159
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,255
Come on, Doyle!

160
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,175
Sarge?

161
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,600
-Flame!
-Doyle, do it!

162
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,774
Don't shoot! Let them burn!

163
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,049
I'll give you "comrade,"
you son of a bitch!

164
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,801
Lie down!

165
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,498
Cease fire! Cease fire!

166
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,751
Cut it out! Cut it out! Cease fire!

167
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,504
Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie 3.

168
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,841
Say again, Dog One is open.
Send in the dozers.

169
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:31,010
I'm waiting for you
to tie in my flanks. Over.

170
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,513
What?

171
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,435
What? I'm sorry, I can't understand
what you're saying.

172
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,946
What did he say? What did he say?

173
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,199
"Look, I washed for supper."

174
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,330
God damn it!

175
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,297
-Hey, Fish.
-Yeah?

176
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,049
Look at this. A Hitler Youth knife.

177
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,721
And now
it's a Shabbat challah cutter, right?

178
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,316
Keep it moving!

179
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,378
That's quite a view.

180
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,880
Yes, it is.

181
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,133
Quite a view.

182
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,105
"Dear Mr Brian Boyd,

183
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,358
"no doubt by now you have
received full information..."

184
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,651
-"Dear Mrs Jensen..."
-"...untimely death of your son."

185
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,653
"...no words of mine
can ever relieve the grief..."

186
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,031
"Our outfit has felt his loss
tremendously."

187
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,867
"He was a fine soldier
and he believed very strongly in..."

188
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,661
"It's no secret any more
that we were involved

189
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,830
"in one of the most important
operations of this war."

190
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,458
"Al was the one
who held us all together.

191
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,793
"He was always the first to volunteer..."

192
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,505
"...came to a clearing near a road
where over 4,000 troops had passed..."

193
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,799
"Your husband served in a combat unit

194
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,426
"whose dangerous duty
is to place itself..."

195
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,638
"...which we all cherish
and hold so dear.

196
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,433
"The loss of Lee and others like him
is a distinct blow to the regiment."

197
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:48,810
"I fully understand your desire

198
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,562
"to learn as much as possible
regarding the circumstances

199
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,773
"leding to his death."

200
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,702
Colonel, I've got something
you should know about.

201
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,078
Yes.

202
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,624
These two men died in Normandy.

203
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,086
This one at Omaha Beach.

204
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:00,631
-Sean Ryan.
-This man at Utah.

205
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,010
Peter Ryan.

206
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,850
This man was killed
last week in New Guinea.

207
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,022
Daniel Ryan.

208
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,649
The three men are brothers, sir.

209
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,193
I've just learned that, this afternoon,

210
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:24,071
their mother is going
to be getting all three telegrams.

211
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,285
That's not all. There's a fourth brother.
The youngest.

212
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,370
He parachuted in
with the 101 st Airborne,

213
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,914
night before the invasion.

214
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,832
He's somewhere in Normandy.
We don't know where.

215
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,335
-Is he alive?
-We don't know.

216
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,132
Come with me.

217
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,322
God damn it.

218
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,991
All four of them
were in the same company

219
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,076
in the 29th Division,
but we split them up

220
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,953
after the Sullivan brothers died
on the Juneau.

221
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,790
Any contact with the fourth son, James?

222
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,836
No, sir. He was dropped about
1 5 miles inland near Neuville.

223
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,212
But that's still deep
behind German lines.

224
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,506
Now, Mac,
there is no way you can know

225
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:50,509
where in the hell he was dropped.

226
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,553
General, first reports out of
Ike's people at SHAEF

227
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,513
said the 101 st is scattered
all to hell and gone.

228
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,974
There's misdrops all over Normandy.

229
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,977
Now, assuming Private Ryan
even survived the jump,

230
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,520
he could be anywhere.

231
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,648
In fact, he's probably KIA.

232
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:07,401
And frankly, sir, we go sending
some sort of rescue mission,

233
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,071
flathatting throughout swarms
of German reinforcements

234
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,991
all along our axis of advance,
they're gonna be KIA, too.

235
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,557
I have a letter here,

236
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:44,021
written a long time ago
to a Mrs Bixby in Boston.

237
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,023
So bear with me.

238
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,403
"Dear Madam,

239
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:53,364
"I have been shown in the files
of the War Department

240
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:57,201
"a statement of the Adjutant
General of Massachusetts

241
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,621
"that you are the mother of five

242
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,336
"sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle.

243
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,759
"I feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine

244
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,930
"that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief

245
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,766
"of a loss so overwhelming.

246
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,603
"But I cannot refrain
from tendering to you

247
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,857
"the consolation that may be found

248
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:32,194
"in the thanks of the republic
they died to save.

249
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,658
"I pray that Our Heavenly Father

250
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,828
"may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

251
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:45,291
"and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved lost,

252
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,043
"and the solemn pride
that must be yours

253
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:52,423
"to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom.

254
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:56,177
"Yours very sincerely and respectfully,

255
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,095
"Abraham Lincoln."

256
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,783
That boy is alive.

257
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:22,411
We are gonna send somebody
to find him,

258
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,707
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

259
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,418
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

260
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,558
We expected 32 tanks to float to
the beach. Twenty-seven didn't make it.

261
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,685
-Miller, Charlie Company.
-Go on in, Captain.

262
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,895
I understand your situation.

263
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,065
But if we don't offload
those duel-drive Shermans by 0600,

264
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,358
we're gonna have an entire division

265
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:56,153
stuck at Carentan
with its pants around its ankles.

266
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:58,656
Well, you let me know then.

267
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,617
Have Charlie Company hold at Vierville
until we can get some armour up there.

268
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,536
Yes, sir. Runner!

269
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,753
Airborne was supposed to win
an open door for the rest of us.

270
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,422
Instead they misdropped,
scattered all their sticks into the wind.

271
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:19,677
-What's your situation?
-Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

272
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,303
We...

273
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:26,976
We took out towed 88s
here, here and here.

274
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,727
They'd already gotten four
of our Shermans

275
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,104
and a number
of our deuce and a halves.

276
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,148
These two minefields
are actually one big one.

277
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,900
We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

278
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,361
but it turned into a mixed,
high-density field,

279
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,571
little bit of everything.

280
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:42,491
Spreng Mine 44s. Schuh Mine 42s,
pot mines. A-200s,

281
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:46,078
the little wooden bastards
that the mine detectors don't pick up.

282
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:50,624
This road here, they placed
big mushrooms, Teller Mine 43s,

283
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:51,876
I guess for our tanks,

284
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,462
from here right up
to the edge of the village. Right here.

285
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,506
So we marked them,
called the engineers.

286
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:58,883
Resistance?

287
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,176
We had higher
support expectations, sir.

288
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,554
There was an under-strength
company without artillery.

289
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,891
Wehrmacht 346 Infantry,
Von Luck Kampfgruppe.

290
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,018
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

291
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:12,271
We turned them over
to MPs from the 29th.

292
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,318
What about our casualties?

293
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,070
Well, the figures

294
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:24,950
were 35 dead, times two wounded.

295
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:28,287
They just didn't wanna
give up those 88s.

296
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,958
It was a tough assignment.
That's why you got it.

297
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,543
Yes, sir.

298
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,296
John...

299
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,176
I've got another one for you.

300
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,220
-Yes, sir.
-This one's straight from the top.

301
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,979
You and I are taking a squad
over to Neuville

302
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,981
on a public-relations mission.

303
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,900
You leading a squad?

304
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,111
Some private in the 101 st
lost three brothers,

305
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,863
and he's got a ticket home.

306
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,073
How come Neuville?

307
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:08,077
They think he's up there somewhere,
part of all those airborne misdrops.

308
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,871
It's not gonna be easy
finding one particular soldier

309
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,122
in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.

310
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,667
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

311
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,335
But what about the company?

312
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,713
We take the pick of the litter
and the rest get folded into Baker.

313
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,507
Jesus Christ.

314
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,634
They took away your company?

315
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:28,222
It wasn't my company. It was
the Army's. So they told me, anyway.

316
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:32,267
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

317
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,769
Beasley's dead.

318
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,647
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

319
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:40,567
-Not that I know of.
-What about Talbot?

320
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:43,696
-This morning.
-Oh. All right.

321
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,198
I'm gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

322
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,033
Assemble at battalion motor pool
on the beach.

323
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,201
Yes, sir.

324
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,661
-Sarge, what we gonna do?
-Okay, listen up...

325
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,121
-What?
-What are we gonna do?

326
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,914
You're going home wrapped
in an American flag

327
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,041
with a hunk of cheese
in your ass, Caparzo, you smart ass.

328
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,876
-Now, listen up.
-I thought you liked it in the ass.

329
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,294
-What?
-I thought you liked it in the ass.

330
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,089
Attention!

331
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,424
As you were.

332
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,592
I'm looking
for Corporal Upham, Timothy E.

333
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,011
Yes, sir. I'm Upham, sir.

334
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,721
I understand you speak
French and German.

335
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,597
-Yes, sir.
-How's your accent?

336
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,349
Just a slight one in French,
but my German's clean.

337
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,101
-Has a touch of Bavarian, sir.
-Very good.

338
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,769
You've been reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

339
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,230
-We're going to a place called Neuville.
-Yes, sir.

340
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,482
-When was this updated?
-Updated as of 0830 hour this morning.

341
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,818
-Sir...
-This is the 1 2th SS Panzer.

342
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,737
These are the two axes
that advance south.

343
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,281
-Sir, there are Germans in Neuville.
-There are artillery up here, sir.

344
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,075
-That's what I understand. Corporal.
-Yes, sir.

345
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,327
Sir, there are a lot
of Germans in Neuville.

346
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,495
You have a problem with that, Corporal?

347
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,040
No, sir. Just if you consider
I've never been in combat, sir.

348
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,750
I make maps and I translate.
And that's...

349
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,753
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

350
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,588
-Yes, sir.
-My two guys were killed.

351
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,340
Yes, sir. It's just that I haven't
held a weapon since basic training, sir.

352
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:48,052
Did you fire the weapon
in basic training?

353
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,344
Yes, sir.

354
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,181
-Well, then, get your gear.
-Yes, sir.

355
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,601
Sir, may I bring...

356
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,857
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

357
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,280
Yes, sir.

358
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,327
Thank you very much, sir.

359
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,788
-That a souvenir?
-No, sir.

360
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,040
Take your time, Corporal.

361
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,922
You should look
on the bright side of things, Corporal.

362
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,131
Yes, sir.

363
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:29,259
For one thing,
you don't need to carry those.

364
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,304
-You'll need that.
-I'll need that, sir. Yes, sir.

365
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,281
Hey.

366
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,533
You want your head blown off,
you fancy little fuck?

367
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,910
Don't you ever fucking touch me
with those little rat claws again.

368
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,538
Get the fuck back in formation.

369
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,418
I was just wondering
where you're from, that's...

370
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,884
-Caparzo, is it?
-Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

371
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,093
Got you.

372
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,387
And another thing.
Every time you salute the captain,

373
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,681
you make him a target for the Germans.

374
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,558
So do us a favour. Don't do it.

375
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,603
Especially when I'm standing
next to him, capisci?

376
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,731
Corporal, what's your book about?

377
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,524
-Hey. Watch your rifle.
-Sorry.

378
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:08,859
Actually, it's about the...

379
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,402
It's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

380
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,404
that develop between
soldiers during war.

381
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,573
Brotherhood?

382
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,241
What do you know about brotherhood?

383
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,452
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

384
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:21,538
Why don't you ask
the captain where he's from?

385
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:26,001
Yeah, ask the captain. He'll tell you
everything you wanna know about him.

386
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,253
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

387
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:30,631
I mean, where's the sense
of risking the lives of the eight of us

388
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,299
to save one guy.

389
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,552
Twenty degrees.
Anybody wanna answer that?

390
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:39,181
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

391
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,058
Hey, doc. I got a mother, all right?

392
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,685
I mean, you got a mother.
Sarge has got a mother.

393
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:47,439
I mean, shit, I bet even
the captain's got a mother.

394
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,359
Well, maybe not the captain,
but the rest of us got mothers.

395
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:54,112
"Theirs not to reason why
Theirs but to do and die"

396
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,282
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean, Corporal, huh?

397
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,034
We're all supposed to die. Is that it?

398
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,870
Upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers.

399
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:04,456
-Yes, sir.
-We all have orders we have to follow.

400
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,251
And that supersedes everything,
including your mothers.

401
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,919
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

402
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,421
Even if you think
the mission's FUBAR, sir?

403
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,508
Especially if you think
the mission's FUBAR.

404
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:18,303
-What's FUBAR?
-Oh, it's German. Yeah.

405
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,973
Never heard of that.

406
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:24,351
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

407
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,063
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

408
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,357
Well, from my way of thinking, sir,

409
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,818
this entire mission
is a serious misallocation

410
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,320
of valuable military resources.

411
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,322
Yeah. Go on.

412
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,866
Well, it seems to me, sir,
that God gave me a special gift,

413
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:43,245
made me a fine instrument of warfare.

414
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,039
Reiben, pay attention.
Now, this is the way to gripe!

415
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,416
Continue, Jackson.

416
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,376
Well, what I mean by that, sir,

417
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:52,170
is if you was to put me
and this here sniper rifle anywhere,

418
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:55,007
up to and including one mile
ofAdolf Hitler

419
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,800
with a clear line of sight, sir...

420
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,761
Pack your bags, fellas.
War's over. Amen.

421
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,139
Oh, that's brilliant, bumpkin.

422
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,267
So, Captain, what about you?
I mean, you don't gripe at all?

423
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,769
I don't gripe to you, Reiben.
I'm a captain.

424
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,772
There's a chain of command.
Gripes go up, not down. Always up.

425
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,149
You gripe to me,

426
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:15,777
I gripe to my superior officers,
so on, so on and so on.

427
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,654
I don't gripe to you.
I don't gripe in front of you.

428
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,740
You should know that as a Ranger.

429
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:21,700
I'm sorry, sir, but...

430
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,619
Let's say you weren't a captain,
or maybe I was a major.

431
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,496
What would you say then?

432
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,373
Well, in that case,

433
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:30,542
I'd say this is an excellent mission, sir,

434
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,754
with an extremely
valuable objective, sir,

435
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,297
worthy of my best efforts, sir.

436
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:40,886
Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
for the mother of Private James Ryan,

437
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,514
and am willing to lay down my life
and the lives of my men,

438
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,060
especially you, Reiben,
to ease her suffering.

439
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,563
-He's good.
-I love him.

440
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,617
Right.

441
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:48,703
-Thunder!
-Flash!

442
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:52,040
Upham, over there. Reiben, you four go.

443
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,552
Go, go, go, go, go!

444
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,852
-You guys are a sight for sore eyes.
-Sergeant Hill, our relief showed up.

445
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,728
How many are you?

446
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,440
Just eight of us.
We're not your relief. Sorry.

447
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,066
You're not the relief,
what do you mean, sir?

448
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,734
We're here for a Private Ryan.

449
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,362
Who? Ryan? What for?

450
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:23,572
-Is he here?
-Well, I don't know.

451
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,949
Maybe with a mixed unit
on the other side of town.

452
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,118
It's hard to get to. The Germans
punched a hole in our centre

453
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,078
a few hours ago,
they cut us right in two.

454
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:33,665
-What's his name again?
-Ryan. James Ryan.

455
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,125
He dropped in with 101st.

456
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,170
-Goldman, get me a runner up here.
-Runner!

457
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:39,921
Come on.

458
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:46,470
Jonesy, make a hole up there!

459
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:51,141
We got stopped by some intense
rifle action from the eastward.

460
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,936
The Germans have been
reinforcing two regiments all day.

461
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,230
The streets have been quiet
for about 45 minutes.

462
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,816
Most of the German fire now
is concentrated to the westward.

463
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:01,109
Who's that on the loudspeaker?

464
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:03,195
That? That's Dagwood Dusseldorf,

465
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,113
our friendly neighbourhood
morale officer.

466
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:08,200
The Statue of Liberty is kaput.

467
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:11,661
-"The Statue of Liberty is kaput."
-...kaput.

468
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,538
That's disconcerting.

469
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,168
Take the second left...

470
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,546
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

471
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,716
Private Ryan, James,
probably misdropped with the 101 .

472
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,801
-Got that?
-Cover!

473
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,852
Go!

474
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,045
-You sadistic fucking animals!
-Get down.

475
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,215
They know we're not in direct contact.
They're gonna single out the runners.

476
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,008
Yeah. Why do they
keep shooting him up like that?

477
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,719
Long as his lungs have breath in them,
he still carries the message.

478
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,513
-We'd do the same thing.
-No, we wouldn't!

479
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,558
-Wade! Get them ready to travel.
-Yes, sir.

480
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,518
-Boyd!
-Come on!

481
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,354
Try again. See if you can let
Captain Hamill know we're coming.

482
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,023
What's the rest of Neuville look like?

483
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,484
Next block's got two-storey buildings,
both sides of the street.

484
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:25,944
-There's a lot of windows.
-...copy? Over.

485
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,405
And then there's a wide open square
with pretty good cover on the left.

486
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,740
-Show me.
-Sarge, hold right here.

487
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:32,242
Yes, sir!

488
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:39,291
All right. Let's stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.

489
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,500
Try a left hook.

490
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:42,335
Shoot and scoot,
two of yours, two of mine.

491
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,879
Hastings, Goldman, up front!

492
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,842
-Reiben, Caparzo. Fundamentals.
-They're still jamming us.

493
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,553
Short runs. High and low at the corners.

494
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,097
It's gonna be tight.
Be prepared for close contact.

495
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,016
-Go. Upham.
-Yes, sir.

496
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,226
-You stay with Sergeant Horvath.
-Stay right here.

497
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:01,938
I'll wear him like underwear, Captain!
Stay with me.

498
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,531
All right, past the end
of the block to the left.

499
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:12,741
Those are the gates to the square.

500
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,117
Good.

501
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,918
Reiben, where's the captain from?

502
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:26,171
You figure that one out,
you got yourself a nice prize.

503
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,881
300 bucks, last I heard.

504
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,217
Company's got a pool.
5 bucks gets you in.

505
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,973
Easy.

506
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,437
It's around this corner.
Defilade right up to those gates.

507
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:46,024
Somebody must know where he's from,
what he did for a living.

508
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,942
I've been with him
since Kasserine Pass,

509
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:49,194
but I don't have a clue.

510
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,071
My ankles are killing me.

511
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:54,115
I'll need a wheelchair
before this war is over.

512
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,660
Oh, that's it. Oh, my God.

513
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:59,996
Got ankles like an old woman.
Like an old...

514
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,790
Oh, God.

515
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,711
Reiben, so, you don't even know
where he went to school?

516
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:08,004
Captain didn't go to school.

517
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:11,257
They assembled him at OCS
out of spare body parts of dead Gls.

518
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,717
You gotta pay attention to detail.

519
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,719
I know exactly where he's from
and exactly what he did

520
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:17,055
'cause I pay attention to detail.

521
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,600
Hey, Upham,
careful you don't step in the bullshit.

522
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,316
-Do it.
-Thunder!

523
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:31,528
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

524
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:44,332
Upham, tell them to show themselves.

525
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,680
Ask them if they know
where the Germans are.

526
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,687
-What's he saying?
-Something about the children.

527
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,232
-They want us to take the children.
-No, no, no. We can't take the kids.

528
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,984
We can't take the kids. We can't!

529
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,320
We can't take the kids! No!

530
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,366
They think they'll be safe with us.

531
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,618
It's not gonna be
safe when they're with us!

532
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:24,748
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!

533
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:28,626
-Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!
-They think they'll be safe with us, sir.

534
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,213
Caparzo! Put that kid back!

535
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:33,965
It's okay.

536
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,302
-Caparzo! Put that little girl back!
-It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

537
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:40,430
Caparzo, give that kid back now!

538
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,559
Upham, how do you say, "It's okay"?
I can't. She reminds me of my niece, sir.

539
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,603
Caparzo, get the kid back up there!

540
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,021
Captain, the decent thing to do

541
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,315
is to at least take her down
the road to the next town.

542
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,651
We're not here to do the decent thing!
We're here to follow fucking orders!

543
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:56,112
Sarge, take this goddamn kid!

544
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,032
Cover! Cover!

545
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:11,252
God damn it! Where'd that come from?

546
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:16,508
He was on the ground
before we heard the shot.

547
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,181
That's where I'd be.

548
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,267
I didn't see it.

549
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:29,187
Four hundred fifty yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under.

550
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:33,525
I wouldn't venture out there, fellas!
This sniper's got talent!

551
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,449
Please don't cry. I'm gonna take you
back to your mama and papa.

552
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:43,743
Please don't cry. Come on.

553
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,414
Carpy.

554
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,845
-Captain.
-Hold on, Caparzo.

555
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,431
Help me up. I can walk. I can walk.

556
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:07,684
Caparzo, stay still!

557
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,406
Two clicks, left wind.

558
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,411
Fish!

559
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,213
Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?

560
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:39,257
Wade, you stay put.

561
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,551
Where's he shot, Captain?

562
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,930
-Captain, can you see him from there?
-You stay there!

563
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,684
Damn it, stay down!
What's the matter with you?

564
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:53,521
Am I gonna take care of you
if you get hit? Huh?

565
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:56,858
-Fish, come over here.
-Carpy, put your head down.

566
00:53:56,942 --> 00:54:00,111
Why can't you put your head down?

567
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,622
O my God, I trust in thee.

568
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,749
Let me not be ashamed.

569
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:16,461
Let not my enemies triumph over me.

570
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,931
Copy it.

571
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,350
Copy it and send it for me.

572
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,894
Carpy, you're gonna send it yourself.
Put it down!

573
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:36,272
-It's got blood!
-I see it. Carpy, I see it.

574
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:44,948
It's to my dad. It's got blood on it, Fish.

575
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:15,520
We got him. Stay down.

576
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:28,449
-How bad is it?
-Chest, maybe lung shot.

577
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,426
Get that 30 up the street!

578
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,473
Detail!

579
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:54,642
-Clear up!
-Clear down!

580
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,202
That's why we can't take children.

581
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,837
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

582
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:26,591
Upham, canteens. Fill them up.

583
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:28,968
-Sergeant Hill.
-Yes, sir.

584
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:33,431
Gather your men. We'll form up
at the northwest corner of the square.

585
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,183
-Jackson!
-Sir.

586
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:40,063
Mellish, check the tower,
hustle back here. Right now. Go!

587
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,534
Fuck Ryan.

588
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,464
-Thunder!
-Flash!

589
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,091
Come on in.

590
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:15,139
Hey, guys, we're looking
for Captain Hamill.

591
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:16,974
Somewhere down there
across the square.

592
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,351
Across the square.

593
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,020
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

594
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,356
Sit down.

595
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:42,500
Jimmy T, go find Captain Hamill,
bring him in here.

596
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,918
What? Up there?

597
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,754
How the hell should I know?
Would you go look, please?

598
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:48,798
Thank you, you moron.

599
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,759
All right.

600
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:55,304
You guys just flake out here for a while.

601
00:57:57,266 --> 00:58:00,726
Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.

602
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,530
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

603
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:15,825
-Drop them now!
-Drop the fucking weapons!

604
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:22,707
-I'll shoot you! I'll shoot you!
-Drop! Drop! Drop them!

605
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,545
Now! Put them down!

606
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,061
Clear up!

607
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:53,070
-Shit. Shit!
-Clear up!

608
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,073
Clear down!

609
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:11,797
-Enough to make you old.
-Let's hope so.

610
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:24,268
Fred Hamill, Pathfinders, 101 st.

611
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:27,313
John Miller, 2nd Rangers. Thank you.

612
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:30,858
We're here looking
for a Private James Ryan.

613
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,945
He's part of your outfit.
Any chance at all you policed him up?

614
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:37,198
-How was the road in?
-Scenic.

615
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:41,452
-We lost most of our ammo.
-Not to mention one of our men.

616
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:45,206
Lieutenant, redeploy that bazooka
to the right side of the road.

617
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:48,251
-Yes, sir!
-And get Ryan up here.

618
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,506
Ryan! Ryan, front and centre!

619
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,299
Ryan!

620
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:00,972
Here comes our boy.

621
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:11,482
Told you he was an asshole.

622
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:15,111
-Sir, Private Ryan reporting as ordered.
-At ease.

623
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:19,031
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

624
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,159
This way.

625
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:25,788
All right. Take a knee.

626
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,676
Private, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

627
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:50,062
Well, there isn't any real
easy way to say this, so...

628
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:55,693
So I'll just say it.
Your brothers are dead.

629
01:00:57,112 --> 01:01:00,865
We have orders to come get you

630
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,035
because you're going home.

631
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,593
Oh, my God. My brothers are dead.

632
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,687
I was supposed to take them fishing
when we got home.

633
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,579
I'm so sorry, James.
I can't tell you how much.

634
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:54,251
-How... How did they die?
-They were killed in action.

635
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:59,673
That can't be. They're...

636
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:04,387
That... That can't be.
My brothers are still in grammar school.

637
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:10,726
-You're James Ryan?
-Yeah.

638
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,605
James Francis Ryan from Iowa?

639
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:17,650
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

640
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,826
What? Does that mean
my brothers are okay?

641
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,619
Yeah, I'm sure they're fine.

642
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,496
Are you sure they're okay, though?

643
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,997
We're looking
for a different Private Ryan.

644
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,083
This is just a big foul-up.

645
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,043
How do you know?
How can you be sure?

646
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:40,256
How do you know the foul-up isn't
that his brothers are okay and that...

647
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,508
Lieutenant, I'm sorry for the trouble.

648
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,762
I just wrote them a letter right
before I left. I got to get home.

649
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,015
I got to get home right now.

650
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,601
-I wanna go home.
-Easy, now.

651
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,062
-So, where in the hell is our Ryan?
-I don't know.

652
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:57,231
Are you in touch with your CO?

653
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,191
-That figures.
-What unit's your Ryan in?

654
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:01,485
Baker Company, 506th.

655
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,112
The guy with the broken foot,
he's 506, right?

656
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,864
Yeah. Charlie, I think.

657
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,615
-You think?
-Yeah.

658
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,952
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

659
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,621
-Where was your drop zone?
-Just inside of Vierville.

660
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:15,583
Vierville? How the hell did you
end up way up here?

661
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:18,919
You got me, sir. C-47 took heavy fire.

662
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,755
Pilot went crazy trying to get out
of there, turning every which way.

663
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,801
Took more fire on the drop.
Got messy. I ended up here.

664
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,928
I haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

665
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,430
God knows where they are.

666
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,223
Anybody from Baker Company
have, like, a big mouth?

667
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,100
Talk about where the drop zone
might've been?

668
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:36,687
No, sir, but I know Baker Company
had the same rally point as us.

669
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,022
Show me.

670
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:40,441
My men are beat.

671
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,485
We're gonna hold up here
for about three hours.

672
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,112
We'll pull out after dark.

673
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:48,115
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

674
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,410
Something with clean sheets
and soft pillows and room service?

675
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:54,955
-How about a nice, comfy church?
-We'll take that.

676
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,875
What have you heard?
How's it all falling together?

677
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,585
Well, we got the beachhead secure.

678
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,296
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

679
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,632
We can't pull out till he's ready, so...

680
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:07,343
-That guy's overrated.
-No argument here.

681
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:10,221
You gotta take Caen,
so you can take Saint-LÃ´.

682
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:12,223
You got to take Saint-LÃ´
to take Valognes.

683
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,974
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

684
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:17,394
-Cherbourg, you got Paris.
-Paris, you get Berlin.

685
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,231
And then that big boat home.

686
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,110
We sure as hell
could use you around here,

687
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,404
but I understand what you're doing.

688
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,114
-You do?
-Yeah.

689
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:31,825
I got a couple of brothers myself.

690
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,912
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

691
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:39,250
No, I mean it. Find him. Get him home.

692
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:49,677
What's with your hand?

693
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,972
I don't know.

694
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:56,016
It started in Portsmouth

695
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:57,768
when they brought us
down for embarkation.

696
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,353
It comes and goes.

697
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,356
Well, you may have to get
yourself a new line of work.

698
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,818
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you any more.

699
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,449
What?

700
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,664
-What?
-Nothing.

701
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,209
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

702
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:24,795
The one that was always walking
around on his hands, you know?

703
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:28,507
And he was singing that song
about the man on the flying trapeze.

704
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,301
-Vecchio.
-Vecchio.

705
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,225
Yeah, Vecchio.

706
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,185
He was a goofy kid.

707
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,940
Remember, he used to pee
a "V" on everybody's jacket

708
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:48,319
for Vecchio, for victory.

709
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,702
He was so short.
He was a midget, wasn't he?

710
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,538
"How did you get to be a Ranger?"

711
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,125
He got shot in the foot once, didn't he,
when he was walking on his hands?

712
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:06,170
Yeah. He could walk
faster on his hands.

713
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:10,341
He could run faster on his hands than...

714
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:14,637
Vecchio.

715
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:17,014
Yeah.

716
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,017
Caparzo.

717
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:31,445
You see, when you end up
killing one of your men,

718
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,449
you tell yourself it happened

719
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:41,163
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.

720
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,875
Maybe 100 others.

721
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:52,049
Do you know how many men
I've lost under my command?

722
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,385
-How many?
-Ninety-four.

723
01:06:55,762 --> 01:07:01,558
But that means I've saved the lives
of 10 times that many, doesn't it?

724
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,938
Maybe even 20, right?
Twenty times as many?

725
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,405
And that's how simple it is.

726
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:17,032
That's how you...

727
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:21,036
That's how you rationalise
making the choice

728
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:23,622
between the mission and the men.

729
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:27,167
Except this time, the mission is a man.

730
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,923
This Ryan better be worth it.

731
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:38,721
He'd better go home,
cure some disease,

732
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:42,307
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

733
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,810
'Cause the truth is
I wouldn't trade 10 Ryans

734
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,688
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

735
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,106
Amen.

736
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,610
Look. There it goes again.

737
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:57,614
Sir, are you all right?

738
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:06,165
Now, look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

739
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:08,542
Why don't you get some sleep?

740
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,670
-I don't know how he does it.
-What's that?

741
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:14,423
Falls asleep like that.
I mean, look at him.

742
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,551
The guy's lights out the minute
his head hits the pack.

743
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,219
Clear conscience.

744
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:20,888
Yeah. What's that saying?

745
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:24,141
"If God's on our side,
who the hell could be on theirs?"

746
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,810
"If God be for us,
who could be against us?"

747
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:29,021
Yeah, what did I say?

748
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:33,358
Well, actually, the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

749
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,235
How is that, Wade?

750
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:40,282
Well, when my mother was an intern,
she used to work late through the night,

751
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,910
sleep through the day.

752
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:44,828
So the only time that we ever got
to talk about anything

753
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,371
was when she'd get home.

754
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,999
So what I used to do,
I used to lie in my bed

755
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,584
and try to stay awake as long as I could,

756
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:54,421
but it never worked
'cause the harder I tried,

757
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:56,715
the faster I'd fall asleep.

758
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,927
Yeah. Well, that wouldn't have
mattered none in my house.

759
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,304
My ma, she would've come home,
shook me awake,

760
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:04,223
chatted me up till dawn.

761
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,850
I swear, that woman
was never too tired to talk.

762
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:10,938
Yeah. That's probably the only time
she could get a word in.

763
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:18,529
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

764
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:21,281
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

765
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:24,993
-Who? Your mum?
-Yeah.

766
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,707
She'd stand in the doorway,
looking at me.

767
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,585
And I'd just keep my eyes shut.

768
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:39,967
And I knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

769
01:09:40,552 --> 01:09:43,011
that she came home early

770
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,390
just to talk to me.

771
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:53,814
And I still wouldn't move.
I'd still pretend to just be asleep.

772
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,323
I don't know why I did that.

773
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,465
We only got a couple of hours.
Shut up and go to sleep.

774
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:32,102
Captain? Sir?

775
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:35,606
Corporal?

776
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,906
How you doing there? Are you all right?

777
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,075
Yeah, I think this is all good for me, sir.

778
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,953
Really?

779
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:52,205
How is that?

780
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,670
"War educates the senses,

781
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,714
"calls into action the will,

782
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,508
"perfects the physical constitution,

783
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,762
"brings men into such swift
and close collision

784
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,973
"in critical moments
that man measures man."

785
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:13,143
Yeah. Well, I guess
that's Emerson's way

786
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,395
of finding the bright side.

787
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,149
-You know Emerson, sir?
-I know some.

788
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:27,658
So, where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

789
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:31,995
What's the pool up to?

790
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:38,168
You know, I think it's around 300, sir.

791
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:41,672
Well, when it gets up to 500,

792
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:44,007
I'll give you the answers,
and we'll split the money.

793
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:46,093
How about that?

794
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:49,763
Well, if that's the way you feel, sir.
I feel it's my duty under your command

795
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:54,101
to suggest that we wait
until it gets up to 1 ,000, sir.

796
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:58,313
What if we don't live that long?

797
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:04,569
-500?
-500 would be good, yeah.

798
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,613
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah.

799
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,994
-Get some sleep, Corporal.
-Yes, sir.

800
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,812
Who's got sulfa powder?

801
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:27,360
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!
He needs a tourniquet!

802
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:28,945
-Wade.
-Yes, sir?

803
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:30,989
-See what you can do.
-Yes, sir.

804
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:34,409
Hold on, fellas. It won't be much longer.

805
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:36,453
How we doing here?

806
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,371
All right.

807
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,999
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

808
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:42,834
Doc's in town.

809
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:44,377
It's all right. It's all right.

810
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:45,962
Don't worry, fellas.

811
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,590
The 29th Infantry's breaking through,
they'll be here soon.

812
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,051
Plasma. Anybody got plasma?

813
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:54,971
-Captain. Hey, Captain.
-Soldier, you want to fill me in?

814
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:57,015
Yeah. Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

815
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,727
99th Troop Carrier Squadron,
carrying in 327th Glider Infantry.

816
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:02,395
This one was mine, sir.

817
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,897
-I was the pilot.
-Private?

818
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,482
-Twenty-two men dead.
-Private, take care of...

819
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:08,401
I ended up over there without a scratch.
It took my co-pilot's head right off.

820
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:10,112
Well, where's the unit?
Who are these people?

821
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:13,198
Well, the guys we came in with, sir,
they headed off first night.

822
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,574
Haven't seen them since.

823
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:18,703
Meantime, other guys keep showing up,
one, two, half-dozen at a time.

824
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,581
Then some officer'll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

825
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:24,126
-head off to make trouble, sir.
-Water. I need a canteen over here.

826
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,211
We're looking for a Private James Ryan.

827
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,547
He's in Baker Company,
the 506 of the 101 st.

828
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,966
No, you got me, sir.
A lot of guys come in and out of here.

829
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,509
-Upham.
-Yes, sir.

830
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:34,427
Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

831
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:36,179
Yes, sir.

832
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:39,015
Reiben.

833
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:43,562
Smell that leg right there.
Find out if it's south of cheese.

834
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:50,527
What?

835
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,367
Keep moving.

836
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,327
Keep moving!

837
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,622
I'm Juden, you know?

838
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:07,460
Yeah, I couldn't pry him out of there,
hard as I tried.

839
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:09,754
-I'd need a winch.
-Yeah.

840
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:15,177
Stars.

841
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:20,098
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,
Deputy Commander, 101 st.

842
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,476
Some fucking genius had the great idea

843
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,103
of welding a couple of steel plates

844
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:28,481
onto our deck to keep
the general safe from ground fire.

845
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:30,150
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me about it

846
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:32,652
until we were just getting airborne.

847
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,739
Well, that's like trying
to fly a freight train. Okay.

848
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:39,743
Gross overload.
Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

849
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,121
I nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

850
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:45,332
And when we released,

851
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,709
you know, I cut as hard as I could,

852
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,296
tried to gain some altitude
and still keep her from stalling.

853
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:55,550
We came down like a fucking meteor.
And this is how we ended up.

854
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,014
And the others, they stopped easy
enough okay though, you know?

855
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:04,851
We were just... We were just
too damn heavy, you know?

856
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:06,770
The grass was wet.

857
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,731
Downward slope and all.

858
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,359
Twenty-two guys dead.

859
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:18,657
-All that for a general?
-One man.

860
01:16:20,952 --> 01:16:24,204
-A lot of that going around.
-FUBAR.

861
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:26,790
-FUBAR.
-FUBAR.

862
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:28,959
FUBAR.

863
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:31,169
You all got that right.

864
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:33,588
Hey, I looked up "FUBAR"
in the German dictionary.

865
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:34,714
There's no "FUBAR" in there.

866
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:36,049
-Upham.
-Yes, sir?

867
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,718
There's more paratroops out there.
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

868
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:40,220
Yes, sir.

869
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,973
Oh, you might want
to check these out, sir.

870
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:44,599
Dog tags.

871
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:47,602
More than I really want to count, sir.

872
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,648
I've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

873
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:53,191
Jackson.

874
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:56,653
-Start going through those.
-Yes, sir.

875
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,489
I'll help.

876
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:04,244
What do you think, Jackson?
Do you think that little prick's in there?

877
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:07,330
Well, if he is, I'm gonna find him.
I bet that son of a bitch is here.

878
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:09,332
I got big money saying
this guy's still alive.

879
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,543
10 bucks says I nail him first.

880
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,254
-Let's see who we got in here.
-You mugs don't stand a chance.

881
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,214
All right, you think this little
shit bird is in here or what?

882
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:18,008
Just keep looking.

883
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,635
All right. Gary Ianico.

884
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,512
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

885
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:24,389
I swear.
All the guineas are buying it, huh?

886
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,266
Oh, come on, not the right name.

887
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,352
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's a buddy of yours.

888
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,980
We gotta find this prick.

889
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,153
Where is this son of a bitch?

890
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,780
Don't mix them up, Jackson, all right?
Keep them in your own fucking pile.

891
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:43,199
How am I supposed to know
who we got?

892
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:45,952
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben? All right.

893
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:49,539
-Everybody be friends.
-Cranky there, huh?

894
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,460
-I think I got a winner.
-What you talking about?

895
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:55,003
Ryan.

896
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:57,797
-Ryan.
-Take a look at that, Mellish.

897
01:17:58,341 --> 01:17:59,632
You know what?
You're a genius. You really are.

898
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,551
R-I-E-N-N-E.

899
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,595
That's Rienne and that's French.
All right.

900
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,764
-You know what that means?
-It means nothing.

901
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,807
-What beats three of a kind?
-I got shit here.

902
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:11,603
-I got all guys from New York.
-I got a full house.

903
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,813
-Do you need a hand with that?
-I got a full house.

904
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:16,483
-I got you beat. I got the straight flush.
-Full house, he's got.

905
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:19,944
You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?

906
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:22,155
-Ryan.
-Fucking unreal, this guy.

907
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,824
Do you need a hand with that?
Can you read that shit?

908
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:27,494
Jesus Christ. Look at this poor bastard.

909
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:30,663
-I guess they're not bullet-proof, huh?
-Guess not. All right?

910
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:32,165
I don't like
what he's got between his ears.

911
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:35,168
Sort of like what you fellas got
between your legs.

912
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:37,337
-We got to give him that.
-That's not bad.

913
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,922
Not bad with you, Jackson.

914
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:41,007
All right, I got three of a kind. All right.

915
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:42,258
-Full house.
-What the hell are you doing?

916
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:44,844
The whole goddamn
Airborne's watching.

917
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:46,388
These aren't poker chips.

918
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:50,308
-All right, all right, all right.
-Put them back in there!

919
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:15,500
He's not here.

920
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:22,340
Maybe we should bust up
into a couple of different groups, huh?

921
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,675
And wander the woods
like Hansel and Gretel,

922
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:24,843
calling his name.

923
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:28,096
He's bound to hear us sooner
or later. Ryan!

924
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:31,349
That might be
a little hard to do, Captain.

925
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:35,311
Maybe the locals have seen him.
Hey, you know...

926
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:41,151
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101 st Airborne?

927
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:45,029
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?
Private James Ryan from Iowa?

928
01:19:45,156 --> 01:19:47,157
Anybody know a Ryan?

929
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:49,576
James Ryan!

930
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:55,623
Hey, Joe, doesn't Mandelsohn pal
around with a Ryan from C Company?

931
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:59,002
-Yeah. I think so.
-Bring him up here, would you?

932
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,889
-Do you know Private Ryan?
-You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

933
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,182
You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

934
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:13,933
-My hearing is not good!
-It comes and goes!

935
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:15,226
-It comes and goes!
-A German grenade went off

936
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,145
-next to his ear.
-A grenade went off right by my head!

937
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:20,273
Got it, got it. Do you know Private Ryan?

938
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:21,816
Who?

939
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:24,360
Private Ryan! James Ryan!

940
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:28,656
-Jimmy Ryan?
-James! James Francis Ryan!

941
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:32,577
-No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.
-All right. Get me a pencil.

942
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:34,996
Something to write on.
Something to write on.

943
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,582
Quick! Quick! Come on, a pencil!

944
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:41,127
A small one, sir.

945
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:42,879
Write this down.

946
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,923
James Francis Ryan, question mark.

947
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,799
Iowa, question mark.

948
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:49,385
Do you know him? Does he know him?

949
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,554
Read the message. Look.

950
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:57,393
-Yeah. Of course I know him, sir.
-Does he know where he is?

951
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:04,609
Yeah, yeah. We missed
our drop zone by about 20 miles,

952
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:08,029
ended up way over
by Bumville or some damn place.

953
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:11,241
Him, me and a couple of other guys
were coming here to the rally point,

954
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:16,496
ran into a Colonel who was gathering
up men to go to Ramelle.

955
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,914
Ramelle.

956
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:20,458
To baby-sit a bridge.
That's the last I've seen of him, sir.

957
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:22,460
Great! Great! Thank you.

958
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,837
Write thank... Read, and thank you.

959
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:27,423
-You're welcome!
-Assemble on me.

960
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,594
Thank you, Lieutenant.

961
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:35,598
Ramelle.

962
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:39,310
We're here. There.

963
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:45,024
Ramelle is on the Merderet River,
right here, just to the southwest of us.

964
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:47,485
You know anything about this bridge
he was talking about, Captain?

965
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:51,447
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

966
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:55,702
We can't push on Paris
until we take a deep water port.

967
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:57,579
And Rommel knows that,

968
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:59,247
so he's gonna try to get his armour

969
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:02,709
across the Merderet river
anywhere he can.

970
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:04,794
That way, he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank

971
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:07,547
when we make
the big right turn to Cherbourg.

972
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,340
That makes any village on that river

973
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:12,719
with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate.

974
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:34,824
Let's go.

975
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:45,668
Captain.

976
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,000
What the hell is that?

977
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:30,338
A radar site. It's gotta be out of action.

978
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:35,218
Looks like we got something in that.
Sandbag bunker right under the station.

979
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:39,263
-See it?
-Yeah. That's my guess, too.

980
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,433
What is it?

981
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:45,395
Machine gun. Probably MG42.

982
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:47,772
Jesus. Is that what got those guys?

983
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,774
Maybe one of them's our boy.

984
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,277
No, their patches are 82nd,
so your luck's not that good.

985
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,446
Yeah, well, I don't know how fast
the rest of you betties are,

986
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:58,032
but I'm thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet,

987
01:23:58,117 --> 01:24:01,160
the krauts will never
even know we were here.

988
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:04,831
So, Captain, what I'm trying to say is
why don't we just go around the thing?

989
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:08,334
I hear what you're saying,
but we can't go around it.

990
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,838
I'm with Reiben on this one, sir.

991
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:16,050
-I mean, we left them 88s.
-For the Air Force.

992
01:24:16,135 --> 01:24:20,221
The Air Force isn't gonna spend
ordnance on one machine gun.

993
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,140
Captain...

994
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,017
We can still skip it
and accomplish our mission.

995
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:28,104
I mean, this isn't our mission, right, sir?

996
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:30,398
Oh. That's what
you want to do, Mellish?

997
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:31,941
You just want to leave it here,
so they can ambush

998
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:33,317
the next company that comes along?

999
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:34,777
No, sir. That's not what I'm saying.

1000
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:37,655
I'm simply saying
it seems like an unnecessary risk,

1001
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,198
given our objective, sir.

1002
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:42,034
Our objective is to win the war.

1003
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:49,250
Sir, I just... I don't have
a good feeling about this one.

1004
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:55,465
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

1005
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:19,530
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

1006
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:22,825
Mellish, you hook to the right.
I'll go up the middle.

1007
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:32,919
Who's going left?

1008
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:38,758
I'll do it.

1009
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:42,303
-I'll go left.
-All right.

1010
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:45,181
Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear.

1011
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:46,724
Yes, sir.

1012
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:52,271
We advance and keep pressure on him
till he has to change out his barrels.

1013
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:55,066
I think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1014
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:59,445
-Maybe I should go up the middle, sir.
-The way you run? I don't think so.

1015
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:03,282
-Maybe I should go left, sir.
-Maybe you should shut up.

1016
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:06,452
Reiben, base of fire.

1017
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:17,755
Mags and clips where
you can reach them, and...

1018
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,800
And extra grenades
for the base runners.

1019
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:47,386
Hill's clear! Four down and dead!

1020
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:52,475
Upham, grab the gear. Get up here!
We need water and extra dressing now!

1021
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:58,272
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

1022
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:08,115
God.

1023
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:09,992
Son of a bitch!

1024
01:28:10,077 --> 01:28:11,327
All right. The sulfa.

1025
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,079
-Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
-I got him.

1026
01:28:13,163 --> 01:28:14,747
-More sulfa, Mellish.
-I got him. I got him, Wade.

1027
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:16,248
-You're gonna be all right.
-Listen to my voice.

1028
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:17,583
You're gonna be all right, Doc.

1029
01:28:17,668 --> 01:28:19,251
How's it look? How's it look?

1030
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:21,253
Wade, you're fine.
You're going on a hospital ship.

1031
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:23,255
-More sulfa! More sulfa!
-Put my legs up.

1032
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,591
-Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
-He's gonna be all right.

1033
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:28,094
-I got 'em. I got 'em. I got 'em.
-You're gonna be okay, Wade.

1034
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:29,512
I got 'em.

1035
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:32,348
Upham, give me your canteen!

1036
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:34,266
-Come on. Come on.
-...we're gonna get you out of here.

1037
01:28:34,351 --> 01:28:35,434
Put some pressure on it.

1038
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:38,396
-You're gonna be okay.
-How's it look?

1039
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,272
-I'm getting some morphine.
-How's it look?

1040
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,817
-It's all right. You're gonna be okay.
-How's it look?

1041
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:44,610
You're gonna be okay.

1042
01:28:44,695 --> 01:28:46,570
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.

1043
01:28:46,697 --> 01:28:49,699
Am I shot in the spine?

1044
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:52,368
-You're okay, Wade.
-Am I shot in the spine?

1045
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:54,537
-Lift him up. Easy, easy, easy.
-All right. Flip him over.

1046
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:55,830
-Easy, easy, easy.
-Put some pressure.

1047
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:58,499
-Easy, easy.
-Lift him up. Lift him up.

1048
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:04,046
It's okay, doc. It's all right.

1049
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,674
Wade, you got an exit wound.

1050
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,509
It's in the small of your back.

1051
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:10,928
How big's the hole in the...

1052
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,972
-About the size of an acorn.
-It's fine.

1053
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:15,099
You're fine. You're fine.

1054
01:29:16,727 --> 01:29:20,604
Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it.

1055
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:24,900
-Put some pressure on it.
-It's all right.

1056
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:27,737
Put some more pressure on it!

1057
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,614
Is there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

1058
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:32,491
Yeah, right here, right here.
Do you know what it is?

1059
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:33,993
-No.
-Right here. Yeah. Right here.

1060
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:35,703
I'm gonna put your hand on it.

1061
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,580
-We got some pressure on there.
-Right there.

1062
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,832
-That's good.
-Okay. That's the one.

1063
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:41,709
Oh, my God, my liver!

1064
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,712
-Oh, my God! It's my liver!
-Something wrong, Wade.

1065
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,172
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

1066
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:48,132
What do you need? What do you need?
What can we do, Wade?

1067
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:50,468
Tell us what to do.

1068
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:51,844
Oh, shit.

1069
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:56,432
I could use... I could use
a little more morphine.

1070
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,934
More morphine, sir?

1071
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:02,396
Okay. Okay.

1072
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:11,614
Give it to him.

1073
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:18,662
-I don't wanna die.
-Here you go. Wade, here you go.

1074
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:22,208
-Here it comes.
-There you go. There you...

1075
01:30:25,504 --> 01:30:27,463
Give him another one.

1076
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:39,809
Mama?

1077
01:30:40,644 --> 01:30:43,562
I want to go home. I want to go home.

1078
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:48,192
Mama. Mama.

1079
01:30:48,318 --> 01:30:51,153
Mama, Mama, Mama...

1080
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:35,698
Reiben, hold him!

1081
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:57,803
Not yet.

1082
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:04,393
First, make him mark and cover
Wade's body for grave detail.

1083
01:32:04,895 --> 01:32:07,897
Same thing
for those paratroopers down there.

1084
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:10,774
Strip that stuff off
and check him for intelligence.

1085
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:15,070
Ask this piece of shit
if he's the one who shot Wade. Ask him!

1086
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:17,865
-It doesn't matter.
-It does matter!

1087
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:22,870
Shut up with that filthy pig latin.

1088
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,874
Jackson, you're hit.

1089
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,294
Shit.

1090
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:34,215
-I guess it just skinned the arm, sir.
-Get it cleaned and dressed.

1091
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:36,842
You and Sarge, watch the perimeter.

1092
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:44,433
-Sir, he says, "Please don't shoot."
-I don't care what he says, Upham.

1093
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:48,229
Sir? Sir, you're gonna let them kill him?

1094
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:53,484
-This is not right, sir.
-You can help him with the bodies.

1095
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,655
What is happening?

1096
01:34:48,141 --> 01:34:49,516
American.

1097
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,187
I like American.

1098
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:04,656
Steamboat Willie.

1099
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:07,409
Yeah, Steamboat Willie. American.

1100
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:21,298
-He's says he's not finished.
-Yeah. That's what you think.

1101
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:23,133
Come on. Yeah.

1102
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:36,438
Please... I like America.

1103
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:39,983
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

1104
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:43,737
Go fly a kite!
Cat got your tongue? Cool beans!

1105
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,618
Betty Boop! What a dish!

1106
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:53,414
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

1107
01:36:00,088 --> 01:36:05,300
I say can you see
I say can you see

1108
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,886
I say...

1109
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:20,190
Fuck Hitler.

1110
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:31,618
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade.

1111
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:33,745
He says he's sorry about Wade, sir.

1112
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,497
Captain.

1113
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:37,499
Captain, this isn't right.

1114
01:36:37,584 --> 01:36:41,128
You know this. He's a prisoner.
He surrendered.

1115
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,797
He surrendered, sir!

1116
01:36:54,476 --> 01:36:56,185
Tell him

1117
01:36:58,188 --> 01:37:01,523
to march 1 ,000 paces in that direction,

1118
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:02,858
then he can take off the blindfold.

1119
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:04,026
We'll be gone, and he turns himself in

1120
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:05,944
to the first Allied patrol
he comes across.

1121
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:07,029
-Thank you, sir.
-You gotta be kidding me.

1122
01:37:07,155 --> 01:37:09,948
-We're letting him go?
-He's a POW, Reiben.

1123
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:14,369
Can't take him with us.
Our guys'll pick him up sooner or later.

1124
01:37:25,048 --> 01:37:27,299
Only if he doesn't get picked up
by his own Wehrmacht first,

1125
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:30,052
then thrown back into circulation.

1126
01:37:32,222 --> 01:37:34,640
Captain, you just let the enemy go.

1127
01:37:34,724 --> 01:37:37,643
-This is such bullshit.
-Y'all got that right.

1128
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:39,728
Bullshit? Right. This is bullshit?

1129
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,897
-Shooting a prisoner, that'd be okay?
-Upham, shut your mouth.

1130
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:43,065
It's against the goddamn rules!

1131
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:47,236
Yeah. The goddamn rules
just walked off with your new friend.

1132
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:53,408
But I guess that was
the decent thing to do, huh, Captain?

1133
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:02,543
Get your gear. Let's go.

1134
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:07,089
You heard him. Gear up.

1135
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:10,259
The Captain just gave you an order.

1136
01:38:10,343 --> 01:38:14,179
Yeah. Like the one he gave
to take this machine gun.

1137
01:38:14,264 --> 01:38:17,391
-That was a real doozy, wasn't it, Sarge.
-Soldier, you are way out of line.

1138
01:38:17,475 --> 01:38:20,727
Yes, sir. That was one hell of a call,
coming to take this nest,

1139
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:23,564
but what the hell? We only lost
one of our guys, going for it.

1140
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:25,983
I swear, I hope Mama Ryan's
real fucking happy,

1141
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:29,653
knowing that little Jimmy's life is a little
bit more important than two of our guys!

1142
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:32,739
But then again, we haven't
found him yet, have we? Huh?

1143
01:38:34,784 --> 01:38:36,159
-Here you go.
-Get the hell off me!

1144
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:37,995
Reiben, get up.

1145
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:42,916
Gear up. Fall in.

1146
01:38:47,964 --> 01:38:50,173
I'm done with this mission.

1147
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:56,805
Hey! Hey!

1148
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:00,809
-Sir.
-Don't walk away from your Captain.

1149
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:03,186
-Reiben, get back in line.
-No, sir.

1150
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:04,646
I'll spend the rest
of my life in the stockade

1151
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:06,064
if I have to, but I'm done with this.

1152
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:08,442
-I'm not gonna ask you again, soldier.
-Captain!

1153
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:09,860
All right, now. This is bullshit!

1154
01:39:09,986 --> 01:39:12,446
-Fall in!
-You're gonna shoot me over Ryan?

1155
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:13,905
No. I'm gonna shoot you
'cause I don't like you.

1156
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:16,950
-Sir, listen...
-Sir, if he wants to go, just let him go!

1157
01:39:17,035 --> 01:39:20,370
Are you letting this happen?
Captain! You see this?

1158
01:39:20,496 --> 01:39:23,540
-Captain? Sir? Sir, Ryan's dead.
-Bullshit!

1159
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:26,084
-Sir, we have a situation you might...
-That is bullshit!

1160
01:39:26,169 --> 01:39:28,670
Captain, I have a sixth sense about
these things. I know it in my bones.

1161
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:31,673
We don't kill that son-of-a-bitch kraut.
Now you're gonna shoot me?

1162
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:34,217
-He's better than you.
-Then why don't you just do it, Sarge?

1163
01:39:34,344 --> 01:39:36,011
Do it, man. Put one in my leg
and give me that...

1164
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:38,764
I'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

1165
01:39:38,848 --> 01:39:40,265
Well, put your money
where your mouth is...

1166
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:41,767
-You don't know when to shut up.
-Do it!

1167
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:43,435
-You don't know how to shut up.
-Pull the trigger, already!

1168
01:39:43,519 --> 01:39:44,853
Captain, please!

1169
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:48,190
-What's the pool on me up to?
-What?

1170
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:51,026
-You are a coward son of a bitch!
-I'm waiting, Sarge.

1171
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:54,780
Mike, what's the pool
on me up to right now?

1172
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:56,657
What's it up to?

1173
01:39:57,283 --> 01:40:01,870
What is it, $300? Is that it? 300?
I'm a schoolteacher.

1174
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:08,710
I teach English composition

1175
01:40:10,046 --> 01:40:12,214
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1176
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:14,049
The last 1 1 years,

1177
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:17,886
I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1178
01:40:19,806 --> 01:40:23,475
I was the coach of the baseball team
in the springtime.

1179
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,688
I'll be doggone.

1180
01:40:28,398 --> 01:40:31,650
Back home, when I'd tell people
what I do for a living,

1181
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:34,653
they'd think, "Well, that figures."

1182
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:38,740
But over here, it's a...

1183
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:42,035
A big...

1184
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:44,955
A big mystery.

1185
01:40:45,998 --> 01:40:48,709
So I guess I've changed some.

1186
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:54,589
Sometimes I wonder
if I've changed so much

1187
01:40:54,674 --> 01:40:59,219
my wife is even going to recognise me
whenever it is I get back to her.

1188
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:03,306
And how I'll ever be able to...

1189
01:41:05,852 --> 01:41:08,478
To tell her about days like today.

1190
01:41:11,733 --> 01:41:13,108
Ryan...

1191
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:17,362
I don't know anything about Ryan.
I don't care.

1192
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:21,700
The man means nothing to me,
it's just a name. But if...

1193
01:41:23,536 --> 01:41:26,037
You know, if going to Ramelle

1194
01:41:26,164 --> 01:41:27,706
and finding him, so he can go home,

1195
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:29,416
if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife

1196
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:33,795
well, then... Then that's my mission.

1197
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,424
You want to leave?

1198
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:40,552
You want to go off and fight the war?

1199
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:44,890
All right.

1200
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:48,769
All right, I won't stop you.

1201
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:51,438
I'll even put in the paperwork.

1202
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:57,778
I just know that every man I kill,
the farther away from home I feel.

1203
01:43:22,989 --> 01:43:24,573
By memories

1204
01:43:25,908 --> 01:43:27,951
Of the days gone by

1205
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:31,580
In my solitude

1206
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:34,958
You taunt me

1207
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:38,587
With memories that never die

1208
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:42,257
I sit in my chair

1209
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:44,551
Filled with despair

1210
01:43:44,635 --> 01:43:46,469
There's no one

1211
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:48,972
Could be so sad

1212
01:43:49,849 --> 01:43:51,892
With gloom everywhere

1213
01:43:51,976 --> 01:43:54,603
I sit and I stare...

1214
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:10,577
Halftrack! Cover!

1215
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:29,804
Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?

1216
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:53,078
Get ready to move on their left flank!
Take their left flank!

1217
01:44:53,162 --> 01:44:56,039
Hold on and make sure they're down!

1218
01:45:17,186 --> 01:45:19,813
101 st! We're coming out!

1219
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:30,198
That was a recon element, 2nd SS.

1220
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:35,120
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

1221
01:45:36,998 --> 01:45:40,417
Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1222
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:42,585
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, 501 st.

1223
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,170
Ryan. First of the 506th.

1224
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:46,631
PFC Toynbe, Third of the 506th.

1225
01:45:46,716 --> 01:45:48,675
James Francis Ryan?

1226
01:45:48,759 --> 01:45:51,261
Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

1227
01:46:03,024 --> 01:46:05,984
Looks like you guys got hit pretty hard.

1228
01:46:06,068 --> 01:46:09,612
Yes, sir. Small unit action.

1229
01:46:12,033 --> 01:46:15,618
They came in,
and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

1230
01:46:21,834 --> 01:46:25,378
Tell you what, sir, if you're our relief,
I'm gonna file a complaint.

1231
01:46:25,463 --> 01:46:27,422
I wouldn't blame you.

1232
01:46:28,174 --> 01:46:29,924
Who's your CO?

1233
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:34,304
It would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1234
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:38,850
I'm afraid the best we can muster up
right now is a corporal.

1235
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:41,478
So, what are you guys all about?

1236
01:46:42,063 --> 01:46:44,564
We're here for him. Ryan.

1237
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,358
Me, sir?

1238
01:46:56,702 --> 01:46:59,079
James Francis Ryan of Iowa?

1239
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:03,374
Yes, sir.
Payton, Iowa, that's correct, but...

1240
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:05,460
What is this about?

1241
01:47:07,296 --> 01:47:10,090
Your brothers were killed in combat.

1242
01:47:16,889 --> 01:47:18,515
Which ones?

1243
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:22,936
All of them.

1244
01:47:32,822 --> 01:47:34,405
On the level?

1245
01:47:35,825 --> 01:47:37,784
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

1246
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:42,497
You might want to take
some time with this.

1247
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:45,625
If there's someplace
you want to go and...

1248
01:47:54,635 --> 01:47:57,554
-What's this all about?
-Ryan lost his brothers.

1249
01:47:57,638 --> 01:48:00,014
-Which one?
-All of them.

1250
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:06,354
You...

1251
01:48:08,983 --> 01:48:12,277
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1252
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:16,156
Well, you're going home.

1253
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:20,243
Our orders are to bring you back.

1254
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:25,165
Bring me back?

1255
01:48:27,543 --> 01:48:31,045
Corporal Henderson, I don't mean
to leave you even more shorthanded,

1256
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:32,463
but orders are orders.

1257
01:48:32,548 --> 01:48:35,383
Any communication about when
you're going to be relieved up here?

1258
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:36,718
Sir, there's no way to tell. I mean,

1259
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:38,386
we have no idea
what's happening south of us.

1260
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:39,804
I have my orders, too, sir.

1261
01:48:39,889 --> 01:48:41,806
They don't include me
abandoning my post.

1262
01:48:41,891 --> 01:48:44,809
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1263
01:48:44,894 --> 01:48:47,228
I don't see that it does, sir.

1264
01:48:48,856 --> 01:48:51,900
The Chief of Staff
for the United States Army says it does.

1265
01:48:51,984 --> 01:48:54,819
Sir, our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost.

1266
01:48:54,904 --> 01:48:57,405
Now, our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge

1267
01:48:57,531 --> 01:48:59,490
across the Merderet
with the exception of two.

1268
01:48:59,575 --> 01:49:01,159
One at Valognes and this one here.

1269
01:49:01,243 --> 01:49:02,493
We let the Germans take them,

1270
01:49:02,578 --> 01:49:04,162
we're gonna lose our foothold
and have to displace.

1271
01:49:04,246 --> 01:49:07,749
Private, your outfit wants to stay,
that's one thing.

1272
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:08,917
But your party's over here.

1273
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:11,169
Sir, I can't leave
until at least reinforcements...

1274
01:49:11,253 --> 01:49:13,671
You got three minutes
to gather your gear.

1275
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:15,840
Sir, what about them?
I mean, there's barely hardly enough...

1276
01:49:15,925 --> 01:49:17,425
Hey, asshole!

1277
01:49:18,177 --> 01:49:22,055
Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1278
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:29,771
-Sir?
-That's right.

1279
01:49:39,657 --> 01:49:44,160
-What were their names?
-Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1280
01:49:46,121 --> 01:49:47,664
Wade and...

1281
01:49:49,166 --> 01:49:50,625
Caparzo.

1282
01:50:03,013 --> 01:50:05,431
It doesn't make any sense.

1283
01:50:07,518 --> 01:50:11,771
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Why? Why do I deserve to go?

1284
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:16,025
Why not any of these guys?
They all fought just as hard as me!

1285
01:50:19,655 --> 01:50:22,740
Is that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1286
01:50:22,825 --> 01:50:26,160
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1287
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:35,795
Tell her that when you found me,

1288
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:39,549
I was here and I was
with the only brothers that I have left,

1289
01:50:39,675 --> 01:50:42,885
and that there's no way
I was gonna desert them.

1290
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:46,222
I think she'll understand that.

1291
01:50:46,348 --> 01:50:49,309
There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1292
01:51:32,311 --> 01:51:34,395
What are your orders?

1293
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:39,567
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1294
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:43,154
The world has taken a turn
for the surreal.

1295
01:51:43,238 --> 01:51:46,074
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1296
01:51:46,742 --> 01:51:49,744
I don't know. What do you think?

1297
01:51:50,788 --> 01:51:53,581
You don't want to know what I think.

1298
01:51:55,459 --> 01:51:57,126
No, Mike, I do.

1299
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:02,131
Well, part of me thinks the kid's right.

1300
01:52:02,257 --> 01:52:04,759
What's he done to deserve this?

1301
01:52:04,843 --> 01:52:08,805
He wants to stay here, fine,
let's leave him and go home.

1302
01:52:10,099 --> 01:52:11,349
Yeah.

1303
01:52:11,934 --> 01:52:17,021
But another part of me thinks
what if, by some miracle, we stay

1304
01:52:17,106 --> 01:52:19,774
and actually make it out of here?

1305
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:24,278
Someday we might look back on this
and decide that

1306
01:52:24,363 --> 01:52:27,782
saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1307
01:52:27,866 --> 01:52:30,785
we were able to pull out of this whole

1308
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:32,995
God-awful, shitty mess.

1309
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:37,166
That's what I was thinking, sir.

1310
01:52:38,335 --> 01:52:40,503
Like you said, Captain,

1311
01:52:42,297 --> 01:52:44,006
we do that,

1312
01:52:44,466 --> 01:52:47,301
we all earn the right to go home.

1313
01:52:50,139 --> 01:52:51,681
Oh, brother.

1314
01:52:55,144 --> 01:52:57,478
This is everything.

1315
01:52:58,188 --> 01:53:03,818
You got the two 30-calibre machine
guns, 1 7 grenades, 1 1 Hawkins mines.

1316
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:07,905
You got the two bazookas,
but they only got eight rounds left,

1317
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,199
and assorted small arms.

1318
01:53:10,325 --> 01:53:13,786
We had a 60 mortar
but an arty round took it out.

1319
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:16,539
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1320
01:53:16,665 --> 01:53:19,876
-Which they're sure to do.
-What are you thinking, sir?

1321
01:53:20,002 --> 01:53:24,589
Well, I'm thinking they're going to try
to whip around the flanks.

1322
01:53:29,178 --> 01:53:31,429
Unless we can draw
them up this main road here

1323
01:53:31,513 --> 01:53:32,638
in between these buildings

1324
01:53:32,723 --> 01:53:36,684
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1325
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,811
-Disable 'em?
-If we can.

1326
01:53:38,896 --> 01:53:40,480
Make that tank a 60-ton roadblock.

1327
01:53:40,564 --> 01:53:42,398
We do that, we got
a fighting chance at their flanks.

1328
01:53:42,524 --> 01:53:44,901
Yes, sir that's good. Split them up.
Don't let them mass anywhere.

1329
01:53:45,027 --> 01:53:47,945
Hit them hard as we can, one-on-one,
and fall back to the bridge.

1330
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:50,239
Machine gun on the move down here,
and number two up high somewhere

1331
01:53:50,365 --> 01:53:52,366
to piss a little bad news down
on their heads.

1332
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:54,702
That would be the idea.

1333
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:56,704
Jackson.

1334
01:53:57,372 --> 01:53:59,624
If we can, I'd like to get you up
in that bell tower.

1335
01:53:59,708 --> 01:54:02,752
-Yes, sir.
-Give you a little company if you need it.

1336
01:54:02,878 --> 01:54:04,879
Yes, sir. Some company couldn't hurt.

1337
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:09,008
I'd say a .30 with about
1 ,000 rounds would be okay.

1338
01:54:09,092 --> 01:54:11,135
Parker, job opportunity.

1339
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:13,221
Yeah. Well, it's not the worst idea
ever, Captain.

1340
01:54:13,305 --> 01:54:14,889
It's just that everything depends
on getting the tank

1341
01:54:14,973 --> 01:54:17,058
down this main road for us
to knock out, right?

1342
01:54:17,226 --> 01:54:20,228
So how the hell do you
plan on doing that?

1343
01:54:20,729 --> 01:54:23,648
Reiben's right. As our esteemed
colleague from the Airborne pointed out,

1344
01:54:23,732 --> 01:54:26,025
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads,

1345
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:29,946
so how do we stop the tank
if we get it to commit?

1346
01:54:30,072 --> 01:54:32,448
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1347
01:54:32,574 --> 01:54:35,701
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1348
01:54:35,786 --> 01:54:37,912
Yeah, but with what?

1349
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:43,417
-Well, we could try a sticky bomb.
-Sticky bomb, sir?

1350
01:54:44,628 --> 01:54:48,464
-Sir, are you making that up?
-No. It's in the field manual.

1351
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:50,424
You check it out if you want to.

1352
01:54:50,509 --> 01:54:52,593
We seem to be out of field manuals, sir.

1353
01:54:52,678 --> 01:54:54,595
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

1354
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,138
All right, you have
some demolition, don't you?

1355
01:54:56,265 --> 01:54:58,182
Some TNT or some composition B?

1356
01:54:58,267 --> 01:54:59,976
Yeah, that, sir, is the one thing
we got plenty of.

1357
01:55:00,102 --> 01:55:02,728
I got that bridge wired with enough
composition B to blow it twice.

1358
01:55:02,813 --> 01:55:04,814
All right. You can spare some, then.

1359
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:08,150
You take a standard-issue GI sock,

1360
01:55:08,277 --> 01:55:11,362
cram it with as much
comp B as it can hold,

1361
01:55:11,446 --> 01:55:13,906
rig up a simple fuse,

1362
01:55:13,991 --> 01:55:16,534
then you coat the whole thing
with axle grease.

1363
01:55:16,618 --> 01:55:21,122
That way, when you throw it,
it should stick. It's a bomb that sticks.

1364
01:55:21,206 --> 01:55:22,832
It's a sticky bomb.

1365
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:25,334
You come up with a better way
to knock the tracks off a tank,

1366
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:27,044
I'm all ears.

1367
01:55:27,129 --> 01:55:30,673
This is good.
Now we got to surrender our socks.

1368
01:55:45,147 --> 01:55:46,647
Haul away.

1369
01:56:00,662 --> 01:56:04,582
All right, select the field of fire.
Crossfire with the one in the bell tower.

1370
01:56:04,666 --> 01:56:08,002
All right, I can cover
1 2 to nine from here.

1371
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:13,341
-Easy!
-I got her!

1372
01:56:47,709 --> 01:56:49,543
Here are the mines.

1373
01:57:00,472 --> 01:57:02,890
For being the best we can do,

1374
01:57:02,974 --> 01:57:06,977
that forward machine gun
is not in a terrible firing position.

1375
01:57:09,648 --> 01:57:12,149
And this position right here,

1376
01:57:14,236 --> 01:57:15,820
this is the Alamo.

1377
01:57:16,405 --> 01:57:20,074
They push us back this far,
last man alive blows the bridge.

1378
01:57:20,158 --> 01:57:22,201
We only got a 30-second delay
on that fuse,

1379
01:57:22,285 --> 01:57:24,328
so let everyone know that
if you are that last man

1380
01:57:24,413 --> 01:57:28,499
you better hurry your ass off,
or you're not going to be alive long.

1381
01:57:28,583 --> 01:57:32,002
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1382
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:34,880
Never more than
two feet away from me,

1383
01:57:34,965 --> 01:57:37,174
and that's not negotiable.

1384
01:57:38,301 --> 01:57:40,761
I'll get some ammo. Come on.

1385
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:45,057
-Hey, Upham.
-Yes.

1386
01:57:45,142 --> 01:57:47,017
-Listen to me, all right?
-Yeah.

1387
01:57:47,102 --> 01:57:48,644
-You're listening?
-Yes.

1388
01:57:48,770 --> 01:57:50,813
All right, we're gonna be displacing

1389
01:57:50,939 --> 01:57:52,523
and falling back like crazy
sons of bitches.

1390
01:57:52,607 --> 01:57:53,691
Right up there.

1391
01:57:53,775 --> 01:57:57,236
So you got to be Johnny on the spot
with the ammo, or we're dead.

1392
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:59,029
-Right.
-You understand that?

1393
01:57:59,114 --> 01:58:01,407
-Johnny on the spot.
-Yeah.

1394
01:58:01,491 --> 01:58:04,618
-You all right?
-Yeah. Yes.

1395
01:58:04,953 --> 01:58:06,203
You know, when we were
shipping out of England

1396
01:58:06,288 --> 01:58:08,247
the supply sergeant was handing
out cartons of cigarettes,

1397
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:11,459
and I said "No, thank you,
I don't smoke."

1398
01:58:12,461 --> 01:58:14,044
"I don't smoke."

1399
01:58:15,881 --> 01:58:18,841
-Quite a situation, huh?
-Unbelievable.

1400
01:58:20,177 --> 01:58:25,723
Here. Fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?

1401
01:58:26,183 --> 01:58:28,058
You got that right.

1402
01:58:30,312 --> 01:58:31,687
FUBAR.

1403
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:35,065
Ouch.

1404
01:58:35,358 --> 01:58:36,984
-Yeah, well...
-FUBAR.

1405
01:58:37,068 --> 01:58:39,570
It's going to be a real show, huh?

1406
01:58:39,654 --> 01:58:41,572
Yeah. Okay.

1407
01:58:47,829 --> 01:58:49,497
Take it easy.

1408
01:58:50,665 --> 01:58:52,124
FUBAR.

1409
01:59:30,038 --> 01:59:34,375
-Who's that singing, sir?
-Edith Piaf.

1410
01:59:36,795 --> 01:59:39,338
What's she so upset about?

1411
01:59:40,173 --> 01:59:41,715
Her lover left her,

1412
01:59:41,842 --> 01:59:45,302
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.

1413
01:59:46,471 --> 01:59:48,389
That would do it.

1414
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:20,629
"Even life itself only represents you.

1415
02:00:23,758 --> 02:00:26,343
"Sometimes I dream
that I'm in your arms."

1416
02:00:26,428 --> 02:00:28,846
What was that part?
She sang that before.

1417
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:31,307
-The chorus. It's the chorus.
-The chorus.

1418
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:34,685
"And you speak softly in my ear

1419
02:00:36,563 --> 02:00:38,981
"and you say things

1420
02:00:39,065 --> 02:00:41,483
"that make my eyes close.

1421
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,905
"And I find that marvellous."

1422
02:00:45,989 --> 02:00:48,616
-Again, Upham...
-Yes.

1423
02:00:49,326 --> 02:00:53,954
...to be honest with you,
I find myself curiously aroused by you.

1424
02:00:54,831 --> 02:00:58,334
-Marvellous.
-No, it's really a melancholy song.

1425
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:02,129
At the beginning of the song, she says,
"And then one day, you left.

1426
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:06,258
"You left me, and I've been
desperate ever since.

1427
02:01:06,343 --> 02:01:09,511
"I see you all over the sky,
I see you all over the Earth."

1428
02:01:09,638 --> 02:01:11,263
Jesus, Upham,
any more songs like this,

1429
02:01:11,348 --> 02:01:13,057
the krauts aren't going
to have to shoot me.

1430
02:01:13,141 --> 02:01:15,976
I'm just going to slit my own wrists.

1431
02:01:16,102 --> 02:01:18,771
You know,
you're a strange bird, Upham.

1432
02:01:18,855 --> 02:01:20,731
Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

1433
02:01:20,815 --> 02:01:22,816
You know what
that song reminds me of?

1434
02:01:22,943 --> 02:01:25,611
It reminds me of Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
and what she said to me

1435
02:01:25,695 --> 02:01:27,196
the day I left for basic.

1436
02:01:27,322 --> 02:01:29,823
What, "Don't touch me"?

1437
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:32,493
No. Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife.

1438
02:01:32,619 --> 02:01:35,412
She comes into my mom's shop
to try on a few things, all right?

1439
02:01:35,497 --> 02:01:39,291
And she's easily, like, a 44 double E.

1440
02:01:39,376 --> 02:01:41,001
-Double E?
-These things are massive.

1441
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:42,336
Those are big.

1442
02:01:42,462 --> 02:01:45,798
No. And I've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42 D, all right?

1443
02:01:45,882 --> 02:01:47,591
So we're in the dressing room,
she's trying to squeeze

1444
02:01:47,676 --> 02:01:51,178
into this side-cut,
silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle

1445
02:01:51,304 --> 02:01:53,472
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1446
02:01:53,556 --> 02:01:56,141
And it's beautiful 'cause she's just
pouring out of this thing, you know?

1447
02:01:56,226 --> 02:01:57,977
-Is it really tight?
-No, no. It's beautiful.

1448
02:01:58,061 --> 02:01:59,520
And she sees me, and she can tell

1449
02:01:59,646 --> 02:02:02,231
I got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty, all right?

1450
02:02:02,357 --> 02:02:04,358
And she says to me,
"Richard, calm down."

1451
02:02:04,484 --> 02:02:06,944
And she says, "When you're over there,

1452
02:02:07,028 --> 02:02:08,904
"if you see anything that upsets you,

1453
02:02:09,030 --> 02:02:12,074
"or if you're ever scared,
I want you to close your eyes

1454
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:15,202
"and think of these. You understand?"

1455
02:02:16,705 --> 02:02:18,831
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1456
02:02:32,012 --> 02:02:34,054
Are you all right, sir?

1457
02:02:35,056 --> 02:02:37,850
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1458
02:02:42,731 --> 02:02:45,691
Is it true you were
a teacher back home?

1459
02:02:46,735 --> 02:02:48,193
Yes.

1460
02:02:48,278 --> 02:02:50,612
See, that's something I could never do,
you know.

1461
02:02:50,739 --> 02:02:55,200
Not after the way me and my brothers
treated our teachers. No, sir.

1462
02:02:57,537 --> 02:02:59,955
I had 1 ,000 kids like you.

1463
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:08,922
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1464
02:03:10,258 --> 02:03:12,926
I've been trying,
and I can't see their faces at all.

1465
02:03:13,053 --> 02:03:15,220
Has that ever happened to you?

1466
02:03:15,305 --> 02:03:17,723
You gotta think of a context.

1467
02:03:19,934 --> 02:03:22,019
What does that mean?

1468
02:03:22,103 --> 02:03:23,645
Well, you don't just think
about their faces.

1469
02:03:23,772 --> 02:03:28,400
You think about something specific,
something you've done together.

1470
02:03:32,113 --> 02:03:35,074
Well, when I think of home,
I think of something specific.

1471
02:03:35,158 --> 02:03:38,285
I think of my hammock in the backyard,

1472
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:43,457
or my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1473
02:03:47,754 --> 02:03:51,048
This one night, two of my brothers came

1474
02:03:51,132 --> 02:03:54,134
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

1475
02:03:54,969 --> 02:03:58,013
and they said
they had a surprise for me.

1476
02:03:58,598 --> 02:04:01,725
So they took me to the barn,
up into the loft,

1477
02:04:01,810 --> 02:04:04,812
and there was my oldest brother Dan

1478
02:04:05,939 --> 02:04:08,982
with Alice. Alice Jardine.

1479
02:04:11,986 --> 02:04:16,156
I mean, picture a girl who just took
a nosedive from the ugly tree

1480
02:04:16,282 --> 02:04:18,867
and hit every branch coming down.

1481
02:04:20,829 --> 02:04:23,455
And Dan's got her shirt off.

1482
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:26,333
So he's working on this bra
and he's trying to get it off

1483
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:29,670
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out,

1484
02:04:30,505 --> 02:04:33,841
"Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!"

1485
02:04:36,511 --> 02:04:40,013
And so Alice Jardine hears this
and she screams, and she jumps up,

1486
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:41,765
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

1487
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:43,058
but she's still got this shirt
over her head.

1488
02:04:43,184 --> 02:04:47,354
She goes running right into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1489
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:51,650
So now Dan is just so mad at us,
he starts coming after us,

1490
02:04:51,734 --> 02:04:54,111
but at the same time,
Alice is over there unconscious.

1491
02:04:54,195 --> 02:04:55,696
He's got to wake her up.

1492
02:04:55,822 --> 02:04:59,074
So he grabs her by a leg
and he's dragging her.

1493
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:02,369
At the same time, he picks up a shovel
and he's going after Sean.

1494
02:05:02,495 --> 02:05:04,621
And Sean said,
"What are you trying to hit me for?

1495
02:05:04,706 --> 02:05:06,832
"I just did you a favour."

1496
02:05:08,668 --> 02:05:10,544
And so this makes Dan more angry.

1497
02:05:10,670 --> 02:05:13,589
He tries to swing this thing.
He loses the shovel.

1498
02:05:13,715 --> 02:05:16,383
It goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

1499
02:05:16,509 --> 02:05:19,094
The thing explodes,
the whole barn almost goes up

1500
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:21,388
because of this thing.

1501
02:05:36,237 --> 02:05:38,113
That was it. That was the last...
That was...

1502
02:05:38,239 --> 02:05:39,781
Dan went off to basic next day.

1503
02:05:39,908 --> 02:05:43,493
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

1504
02:05:43,578 --> 02:05:45,704
That was two years ago.

1505
02:05:47,582 --> 02:05:48,957
Oh, my.

1506
02:05:50,919 --> 02:05:54,463
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

1507
02:05:55,715 --> 02:05:57,090
No.

1508
02:05:58,259 --> 02:06:00,969
No. That one I save just for me.

1509
02:07:06,286 --> 02:07:08,161
Enemy from the east.

1510
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:12,249
He sees Tiger tanks, two of them.

1511
02:07:12,333 --> 02:07:14,334
Panzer tanks, two of them.

1512
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:16,253
Infantry.

1513
02:07:16,337 --> 02:07:18,213
Fifty plus change.

1514
02:07:27,181 --> 02:07:28,932
Disperse! You know what to do!

1515
02:07:29,017 --> 02:07:30,559
-Reiben, get on the rabbit.
-Yes, sir.

1516
02:07:30,685 --> 02:07:34,021
-Upham, get some cover.
-Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!

1517
02:07:34,147 --> 02:07:37,065
-This is it.
-Everybody check your ammo!

1518
02:07:37,734 --> 02:07:39,026
Good luck, Reiben.

1519
02:07:39,152 --> 02:07:42,487
I don't need any luck, Sarge,
I was born lucky.

1520
02:07:55,251 --> 02:07:56,543
One in five tracer?

1521
02:07:56,627 --> 02:07:58,628
Yep, and tracers point both ways.

1522
02:07:58,713 --> 02:08:02,758
Yeah? Why don't you check
the head space and she should run.

1523
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:12,809
Upham! Hustle up!

1524
02:09:03,152 --> 02:09:04,820
-Corporal Upham?
-Yes, sir.

1525
02:09:04,946 --> 02:09:07,197
We don't have a 30-calibre
machine gun in this position.

1526
02:09:07,281 --> 02:09:10,659
Either Mr Mellish or Mr Jackson
in the bell tower needs that.

1527
02:09:10,785 --> 02:09:12,119
Yes, sir.

1528
02:09:12,954 --> 02:09:16,206
Upham! Jackson's fine.
Turn around to Mellish.

1529
02:09:37,645 --> 02:09:42,607
There's a ton of infantry, Captain.
I don't know if they took the bait though.

1530
02:10:05,381 --> 02:10:07,507
You got any more of that?

1531
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:56,014
Panzers didn't take the bait.

1532
02:11:00,937 --> 02:11:03,772
Infantry's moving to the left.

1533
02:11:03,856 --> 02:11:07,234
Halftrack just went by
with about 20 troops, sir.

1534
02:12:45,916 --> 02:12:49,252
Mellish! Henderson! Displace!

1535
02:13:10,816 --> 02:13:12,609
Do it, now! Light it up!

1536
02:13:12,693 --> 02:13:14,486
You! Light it!

1537
02:13:25,665 --> 02:13:27,791
Thirty infantry on the right flank!

1538
02:13:27,875 --> 02:13:30,377
Get over there,
find a hole, and stop them!

1539
02:13:30,461 --> 02:13:32,128
Displace!

1540
02:13:43,724 --> 02:13:45,016
Upham!

1541
02:14:00,408 --> 02:14:01,866
Clear!

1542
02:14:03,661 --> 02:14:04,911
Krauts!

1543
02:14:06,914 --> 02:14:08,415
Right flank!

1544
02:14:44,869 --> 02:14:47,036
Get down! Get down!

1545
02:14:54,086 --> 02:14:57,213
Upham! Upham! 30-cal! Hurry!

1546
02:14:57,298 --> 02:15:00,800
And find the captain!
This flank's going to fold!

1547
02:15:55,689 --> 02:15:58,483
Reversing! He's still in this fight!

1548
02:15:59,485 --> 02:16:02,028
No, no, Ryan, get down! Get down!

1549
02:16:14,959 --> 02:16:36,813
Ryan!

1550
02:16:39,149 --> 02:16:40,733
-Ryan!
-Get off me!

1551
02:16:40,860 --> 02:16:43,319
-Are you all right?
-Get off me!

1552
02:16:43,404 --> 02:16:45,572
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine, too, Captain. Thanks.

1553
02:16:46,407 --> 02:16:51,077
Okay, both sides!
Get aboard! Get a grenade in there!

1554
02:16:54,039 --> 02:16:55,540
Grenade!

1555
02:16:57,376 --> 02:16:59,043
20-mill!

1556
02:17:00,504 --> 02:17:03,214
Flak gun, 20 millimetre. Take it out!

1557
02:17:15,561 --> 02:17:19,105
Heavy weapon in defilade below!
I ain't got a shot!

1558
02:17:23,611 --> 02:17:25,320
Pincer move, Parker!

1559
02:17:25,446 --> 02:17:27,906
-Targets 8 o'clock low!
-Shit!

1560
02:17:27,990 --> 02:17:30,241
God grant me strength.

1561
02:17:44,131 --> 02:17:45,673
Displace!

1562
02:17:45,799 --> 02:17:47,175
Come on!

1563
02:18:02,983 --> 02:18:05,735
Cover, Upham! Cover! Cover!

1564
02:18:22,503 --> 02:18:24,504
I'm out of 30-calibre.

1565
02:18:27,883 --> 02:18:30,760
Blessed be the Lord, my strength,
which teaches my hands to war

1566
02:18:30,844 --> 02:18:33,179
and my fingers to fight.

1567
02:18:41,689 --> 02:18:44,190
My goodness and my fortress,

1568
02:18:44,274 --> 02:18:46,943
my high tower and my deliverer,

1569
02:18:49,530 --> 02:18:52,740
my shield and he in whom I trust.

1570
02:18:55,786 --> 02:18:57,870
Come here, baby.

1571
02:19:20,477 --> 02:19:22,270
Parker, get down!

1572
02:19:43,959 --> 02:19:46,377
Captain, that 20-millimetre's killing us.

1573
02:19:46,462 --> 02:19:48,755
We gotta try to flank it somehow.

1574
02:19:48,881 --> 02:19:51,758
Well, let me get over for the top shot.

1575
02:20:16,241 --> 02:20:17,658
Upham!

1576
02:20:36,512 --> 02:20:40,973
Upham! Upham!
Upham, ammo, God damn it!

1577
02:21:24,184 --> 02:21:26,602
I'm jammed! I'm jammed!
You got any 30-cal?

1578
02:21:26,687 --> 02:21:28,354
-I'm out.
-Shit.

1579
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:42,702
Upham! Upham!

1580
02:22:40,844 --> 02:22:42,303
Reiben!

1581
02:23:08,789 --> 02:23:12,959
I'm out! I need another bandoleer!
Anybody got a bandoleer?

1582
02:23:37,985 --> 02:23:40,152
God! God!

1583
02:23:44,449 --> 02:23:47,368
You stupid son of a bitch!

1584
02:24:31,038 --> 02:24:33,581
Let's stop. Let's stop. Let's stop.
Listen to me! Listen to me! Stop!

1585
02:24:33,665 --> 02:24:35,416
Stop! Don't...

1586
02:25:12,454 --> 02:25:17,291
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1587
02:25:17,376 --> 02:25:19,168
Son of a bitch!

1588
02:25:20,629 --> 02:25:21,670
Bitch!

1589
02:26:40,709 --> 02:26:43,836
-I'm out.
-Those 60 rounds.

1590
02:26:45,213 --> 02:26:48,382
-We can use them without the tube.
-How?

1591
02:26:48,467 --> 02:26:51,427
Fuse-arming wire, set back, heave it!

1592
02:27:07,152 --> 02:27:08,819
Panzerschreck!

1593
02:27:42,896 --> 02:27:45,105
We're going to the Alamo.

1594
02:27:55,367 --> 02:27:57,201
Alamo! Alamo!

1595
02:28:16,763 --> 02:28:19,056
We'll take it! You fall back!

1596
02:28:19,140 --> 02:28:22,768
-You be right behind us!
-Soon as we're in business!

1597
02:28:26,731 --> 02:28:28,816
Displace. Reiben.

1598
02:28:31,319 --> 02:28:32,778
Reload.

1599
02:29:21,578 --> 02:29:23,120
All right, go.

1600
02:29:24,372 --> 02:29:25,456
We're blowing the bridge!

1601
02:29:25,540 --> 02:29:28,459
-Get off! Clear the bridge!
-Displace...

1602
02:29:51,316 --> 02:29:54,318
Sarge! Mike, are you all right?

1603
02:29:54,402 --> 02:29:56,945
-I just got the wind knocked out of me.
-Well, get out of here!

1604
02:29:57,030 --> 02:30:00,407
Take cover!
We're going to blow this bridge!

1605
02:30:01,868 --> 02:30:03,619
Come on, come on!

1606
02:30:08,416 --> 02:30:11,251
Tiger coming!
Coming across the bridge!

1607
02:30:43,326 --> 02:30:46,620
Captain, get behind something!

1608
02:30:46,705 --> 02:30:49,373
Come on, Captain, move it!

1609
02:31:12,313 --> 02:31:13,522
Mike.

1610
02:31:18,737 --> 02:31:20,070
Mike!

1611
02:31:59,068 --> 02:32:00,360
Captain.

1612
02:32:03,156 --> 02:32:07,242
Captain, where the hell are you going?
Captain, get back here!

1613
02:34:00,315 --> 02:34:01,648
Upham.

1614
02:34:32,639 --> 02:34:34,848
Hang in there, Captain.

1615
02:35:18,977 --> 02:35:20,686
Medic!

1616
02:35:23,481 --> 02:35:26,024
Medic! We got a medic?

1617
02:35:32,824 --> 02:35:35,701
They're tank-busters, sir. P-51 s.

1618
02:35:36,661 --> 02:35:38,870
Angels on our shoulders.

1619
02:35:44,836 --> 02:35:46,545
What, sir?

1620
02:35:51,009 --> 02:35:52,384
James...

1621
02:35:54,178 --> 02:35:55,679
Earn this.

1622
02:35:59,934 --> 02:36:01,393
Earn it.

1623
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:33,008
"My dear Mrs Ryan,

They wanted to come with me.

To be honest with you,

1657

I wasn't sure how I'd feel
coming back here.

Every day I think about

I hope that was enough.

have done for me.

-What?

1667
02:40:11,769 --> 02:40:13,937
Tell me I'm a good man.

You are.
