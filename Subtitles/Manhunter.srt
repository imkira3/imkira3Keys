1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:17,788
We should've talked
at the boatyard.

3
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:20,124
You don't wanna
talk about it here.

4
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:24,795
I'm not falling all over myself
to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.

5
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,547
How much do you know?

6
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:27,631
Not much.

7
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:35,890
The Birmingham one was in
the papers over a month ago.

8
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,853
The second one in Atlanta
was all over TV.

9
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,063
Did you ever think
about giving me a call?

10
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:43,815
No.

11
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:45,441
Why not?

12
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,068
I quit. Remember?

13
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:53,908
You look all right now.

14
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,704
I am all right.

15
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:13,512
If you can't look anymore,
I understand.

16
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:17,433
Don't try to run
a game down on me, Jack.

17
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:27,276
If I really didn't need you
to come back, I wouldn't ask.

18
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,819
This guy's on a lunar cycle.

19
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:32,407
I have three weeks and a few days
until the next full moon.

20
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:37,329
We have a better chance to get
him fast if you help.

21
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:22,625
I'll think about it.

22
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:25,002
Stay and eat.

23
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:37,140
Hi, Molly.

24
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:51,238
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?

25
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:52,447
Yep.

26
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:57,119
How many turtle eggs
do you think are in here?

27
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:58,203
In this hatchery?

28
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:00,540
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.

29
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,460
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?

30
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:06,337
Yeah, but not now.

31
00:06:06,422 --> 00:06:08,881
These are all gonna make it,
guaranteed.

32
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:14,762
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?

33
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:16,139
They can't dig under.

34
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:19,017
That's why we bury the wire
down in the sand.

35
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,730
We need more staples, pal.

36
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:34,325
You're supposed to be
his friend, Jack.

37
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,536
Why didn't you leave him alone?

38
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:41,665
If he decides to do it, Molly,

39
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:45,419
I'll keep him as far away
from it as I can.

40
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:02,854
We got it pretty good, don't we?

41
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:05,023
We have it more than good.

42
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:09,152
All that happened to you
before lets you know that.

43
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:15,450
If I went back, I'd only
look at evidence.

44
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:19,120
I wouldn't get deeply involved.

45
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:22,290
He'd never even see me
or know my name.

46
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:26,336
If they find him, they'll have
to take him down, not me.

47
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,759
What do you think?

48
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:39,058
I think you've already decided
and you're not really asking.

49
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:43,979
If I were asking?

50
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:48,025
Stay here with me,

51
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,985
me and Kevin.

52
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,280
But it's selfish, and I know it.

53
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:00,747
Come here.

54
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:03,020
OFFICER: I'll come inside with you,
if you want, to show you around.

55
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:15,657
Mr. Crawford said maybe
you'd want to be alone, but...

56
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:17,242
That's right.

57
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:22,372
There's a VCR hooked up
in your hotel room.

58
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:27,879
They transferred some home movies
of both families onto half-inch VHS.

59
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:29,214
Thanks.

60
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:15,406
Intruder entered through kitchen
sliding door.

61
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,200
Used a glass cutter anchored
to a suction cup.

62
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,077
His entry was skillful.

63
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:24,207
All the prints are smooth gloves.

64
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:28,420
Blond hair, strong,
size 12 shoe imprint.

65
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:34,760
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva
on glass from licking the suction cup.

66
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:39,014
Why didn't he care that
he left saliva on the glass?

67
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:45,354
It was hot out that night,

68
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,565
so inside the house
must have felt cool to him.

69
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:55,239
Intruder cut Charles Leeds'
throat as he was rising,

70
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:57,325
then shot Mrs. Leeds.

71
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:59,786
Bullet entered right of her navel
and lodged in her lumbar spine,

72
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,538
but she died of strangulation.

73
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:04,874
Moderate elevation of serotonin
and marked increase

74
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,376
of free histamine level in gunshot wound

75
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,380
indicates she lived at least five minutes
after she was shot.

76
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,384
All her other injuries were post-mortem.

77
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:19,056
Direction and velocity of bloodstains
on east wall indicate arterial spray.

78
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,558
Even with his throat cut,
Leeds tried to fight

79
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:25,104
because the intruder was moving
to the children's room.

80
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,316
Bloodstains on west wall
of master bedroom

81
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,653
and matted sliding marks on hall
carpet remain unexplained,

82
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:38,325
as does superficial ligature mark
around Mr. Leed's chest,

83
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:41,495
also believed to be post-mortem.

84
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,545
What did the killer do with them
after they were dead?

85
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,078
VALERIE ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.

86
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:22,788
Sorry, I can't come
to the phone right now,

87
00:13:22,873 --> 00:13:25,666
but if you'd like to leave a message
please do so after the beep,

88
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:27,752
and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

89
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,393
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Twenty-ninth floor.

90
00:13:47,023 --> 00:13:48,315
Going up.

91
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:11,087
When they were dead,

92
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:13,298
he smashed the mirrors and
began selecting pieces

93
00:14:13,382 --> 00:14:15,675
that he would use
later on Mrs. Leeds.

94
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:22,058
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children
would take less than a minute.

95
00:14:23,393 --> 00:14:27,063
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem,
four or five minutes later.

96
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:31,317
What did he do in the interval?

97
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:37,990
The smeared bloodstains
on the west wall...

98
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:24,789
Hello?
WILL: Molly?

99
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:26,708
MOLLY: Will, is that you?

100
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,293
Yeah, it's me, honey.

101
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:33,089
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.

102
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:36,175
I love you.

103
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,469
I love you too, baby.

104
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:27,854
What are you dreaming?

105
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:35,320
That's something you can't afford
for me to know about, isn't it?

106
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:41,368
God, she's lovely, isn't she?

107
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,836
It was maddening to have to touch
her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?

108
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:54,131
They found talcum powder on her leg,

109
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:57,093
but there wasn't any talcum
powder in the bathroom.

110
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:03,683
The talcum powder came out of
a rubber glove

111
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:06,227
as you pulled it off to touch her.

112
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:11,148
You took off your gloves to
touch her, didn't you?

113
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:13,902
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?

114
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:15,654
You touched her with your bare hands,

115
00:17:15,738 --> 00:17:18,198
and then you put your gloves back on.

116
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:21,076
But while your gloves were off,

117
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,579
did you open all their eyes
so that they could see you?

118
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:38,969
JACK: Hello?

119
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:40,930
Jack, this is Graham.

120
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,349
Is Price still in Latent Prints?

121
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:47,186
Yeah, he's in charge of the
Single Print Index now.

122
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:48,730
What do you got, Will?

123
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:49,856
Get him to Atlanta.

124
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,691
Atlanta PD swears
they dusted everything,

125
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:52,817
and their guy is pretty good.

126
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:54,569
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.

127
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:56,279
I'll get him on a plane
in the morning.

128
00:17:56,363 --> 00:17:58,823
What do you want him to do?

129
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:02,368
Dust Mrs. Leeds'
finger and toenails

130
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:04,412
and the corneas
of all their eyes.

131
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,291
I think he took off his gloves.

132
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:15,340
Our people swear he wore
surgeon's gloves the whole time.

133
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,426
They dusted everything.

134
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,553
Your report
didn't mention eyes.

135
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:22,890
Why do you think he took
his gloves off?

136
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:25,350
WILL: Because Mrs. Leeds
was a beautiful woman.

137
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,772
This is what the subject's
teeth looked like.

138
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:32,483
The Smithsonian in Washington
reconstructed these

139
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,359
from the impressions that
we took of the bite marks

140
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:35,611
on the Leeds woman here

141
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:38,948
and the Jacobi woman
in Birmingham last month.

142
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:43,286
As you can see, he has
pegged lateral incisors,

143
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,789
that's these teeth
here and here.

144
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,542
SPRINGFIELD:
Vice and Narcotics,

145
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,795
you take the K-Y cowboys
and leather bars.

146
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,671
Marcus, Whitman,
heads up at the funeral.

147
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:56,549
The rest of your assignments
are on the sheet. Let's go.

148
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:58,301
One more thing.

149
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:01,930
I've heard officers referring to
this killer as the Tooth Fairy.

150
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:04,432
Well, I don't want to hear
that in public,

151
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:06,643
and I don't want to see
it in internal memoranda.

152
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:08,061
That's it.

153
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,954
I know a burglar's gonna fence
what he stole

154
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,373
'cause his motive is cash money.

155
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,376
I know his motive,
so I go to work on fences.

156
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,295
This guy, we don't
even have motive.

157
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:36,966
None of us have shit,
and we know it.

158
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,552
WILL: It's in his dreams.

159
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,012
His motive?
WILL: Yeah.

160
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,599
His act fuels his fantasy.

161
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,434
Which is?

162
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,062
I don't know.

163
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,981
The commissioner was saying
that you're the one

164
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,441
who got Garrett Jacob Hobbs,

165
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,902
and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago.

166
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,946
Lecktor killed nine people,
didn't he?

167
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,615
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.

168
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,535
What happened to them?

169
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,829
One's on a respirator
at a hospital in Baltimore,

170
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,166
the other's in a private
mental hospital in Denver.

171
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,711
What did the psychologists
say was wrong with Lecktor?

172
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,673
The psychologists call him
a psychopath.

173
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,342
They don't know what else to call him.

174
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:24,265
I understand he cut you
pretty good.

175
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,896
What about the dog?

176
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:36,153
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it
in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.

177
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:38,447
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat,
didn't they?

178
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:39,865
That's right.

179
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:44,077
We found a litter box downstairs,
but we didn't find a cat.

180
00:20:44,454 --> 00:20:47,706
Why don't you get Birmingham PD
a methane probe out of Washington,

181
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,374
have them cover the back yard.

182
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:52,419
Maybe the cat's dead and the
kids buried it.

183
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:55,339
SPRINGFIELD: Yeah?

184
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,465
OVER PHONE:
This is Jimmy Price, FBI.

185
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:58,884
Let me put you on speakerphone.

186
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:00,469
Who am I talking to?

187
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:01,595
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.

188
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,846
You got Will Graham here, too.

189
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:06,267
I got a partial print with a
tented arch, it's probably a thumb.

190
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:10,146
And the fragment of a palm off the nail
of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.

191
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:13,149
Thumbprint came off
the oldest kid's left eye.

192
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:14,859
It stood out against
an eight-ball hemorrhage

193
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:16,069
from the gunshot wound.

194
00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:17,987
Can we make an identification
off of it?

195
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:21,366
Maybe, if he's ever been printed
and he's in my index.

196
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:23,368
I want to work these up
in my own darkroom.

197
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:25,662
I'll fax the prints
down to you this afternoon.

198
00:21:25,746 --> 00:21:27,163
Thanks, Jimmy.

199
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:42,096
No comment.

200
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:47,977
JACK: If we get lucky
with that print, we're in,

201
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:49,478
if Jimmy can find
him in the index

202
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:51,063
and if he's ever been printed.

203
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:52,106
If not, I don't know.
Hey, Will Graham!

204
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,108
What do you say?
You remember me?

205
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:56,110
Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor
case for the Tattler,

206
00:21:56,194 --> 00:21:57,486
did the paperback.

207
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,822
So, Will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?

208
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:01,073
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch.

209
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:02,283
Lounds, why don't you give it a rest?

210
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:04,536
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.

211
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,081
So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor?
How does he do them?

212
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,042
How's he do them, Will?

213
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:15,797
Keep the fuck away from me.

214
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,132
JACK: Will, Will.

215
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:28,101
Son of a bitch snuck into the hospital
while I was sedated after Lecktor.

216
00:22:28,185 --> 00:22:30,437
He pulled back the sheets,
and he took pictures.

217
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:31,563
Yeah, I know.

218
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:33,816
Look, don't expect too much from me,
all right?

219
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,068
We only got three weeks left,
and you're our best shot.

220
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:39,071
You think I'm gonna see him standing
in the street and say, "There he is"?

221
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:41,741
That's Houdini you're thinking about.

222
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,620
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until
we get smart or get lucky.

223
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:47,663
He won't stop.

224
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:48,789
Why?

225
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:51,542
He's got a genuine taste for it.

226
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:54,378
You do know something about him.

227
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,089
Not enough.

228
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:02,346
I think I'll go see
Lecktor tomorrow.

229
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,680
Why?

230
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:06,767
Recover the mindset.

231
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:43,971
That's the same atrocious aftershave
you wore in court three years ago.

232
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,349
Yeah, I keep
getting it for Christmas.

233
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,355
Did you get my card?

234
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:53,481
I got it. Thank you.

235
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,735
How is Officer Stewart? The one who
was first to see my basement.

236
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,320
Stewart's fine.

237
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,532
Emotional problems, I hear.

238
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:03,200
Do you have any problems, Will?

239
00:24:03,284 --> 00:24:04,618
No.

240
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:06,787
No, of course you don't.

241
00:24:08,998 --> 00:24:11,291
I'm glad you came.

242
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:14,336
My callers are mostly
clinical psychologists

243
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,713
from cornfield
universities somewhere.

244
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,465
Second-raters, the lot.

245
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,759
Dr. Bloom showed me your article
on surgical addiction

246
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:22,469
in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.

247
00:24:22,554 --> 00:24:23,554
And?

248
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:24,763
Very interesting.

249
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:26,598
Even to a layman.

250
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:30,687
I want you to help me,
Dr. Lecktor.

251
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:33,773
Yes, I thought so.

252
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:34,983
It's about Atlanta
and Birmingham.

253
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:36,276
Yes?

254
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,360
You read about it?

255
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:38,945
In the papers.

256
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:41,239
I don't tear out the articles.

257
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:45,326
I wouldn't want them to think
I was dwelling on anything morbid.

258
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,540
You want to know how he's choosing
them, don't you?

259
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:51,791
I thought you might
have some ideas.

260
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:53,042
Why should I tell you?

261
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:55,545
You'd get to see the file on this case.

262
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:56,629
And there's another reason.

263
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:57,964
Pray tell.

264
00:24:58,048 --> 00:24:59,383
Thought you might be curious to see

265
00:24:59,468 --> 00:25:01,135
if you're smarter than the person
I'm looking for.

266
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:03,971
Then by implication you think you're
smarter than me, since you caught me.

267
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:06,432
No. I know that
I'm not smarter than you.

268
00:25:06,516 --> 00:25:08,142
Then how did you catch me?

269
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:09,185
You had disadvantages.

270
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:10,603
What disadvantages?

271
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:12,146
You're insane.

272
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:16,066
You are very tan, Will.

273
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,861
Your hands are rough.

274
00:25:20,572 --> 00:25:23,032
They don't look like
cop's hands anymore.

275
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:26,410
And that shaving lotion is something
a child would select.

276
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:28,997
It has a ship on the bottle,
doesn't it?

277
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:34,794
Don't think you can persuade me with
appeals to my intellectual vanity.

278
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:37,672
I don't think
I'll persuade you at all.

279
00:25:37,757 --> 00:25:40,091
You'll either
do it or you won't.

280
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:44,513
Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working
on it, and he's the best.

281
00:25:44,597 --> 00:25:46,348
Do you have the file with you?
Yes.

282
00:25:46,432 --> 00:25:47,599
Pictures?
Yes.

283
00:25:47,683 --> 00:25:49,392
Let me have them,
and I might consider it.

284
00:25:49,477 --> 00:25:50,810
No.

285
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:56,274
Dream much, Will?

286
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,985
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.

287
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:01,447
You haven't threatened
to take away my books yet.

288
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:06,953
Let me have the file, and I'll tell
you what I think.

289
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:10,560
This is a very shy boy, Will.

290
00:27:11,562 --> 00:27:12,937
What were their yards like?

291
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:16,190
Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.

292
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:18,776
Why?

293
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:20,153
Because, my dear Will,

294
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:23,323
if this pilgrim imagines he has
a relationship with the moon,

295
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:25,701
he might go outside to look at it.

296
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,288
Have you ever seen blood
in the moonlight?

297
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:31,206
It appears quite black.

298
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:36,420
If one were nude, it would be better
to have privacy for this sort of thing.

299
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:38,881
That's interesting.

300
00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:41,216
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.

301
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:42,801
I considered it.

302
00:27:42,886 --> 00:27:46,180
You came here to look at me, to get
the old scent back again, didn't you?

303
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,514
I want your opinion.

304
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,183
I don't have one right now.

305
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,019
Well, when you have one,
I'd like to hear it.

306
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,103
Can I keep this?

307
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:54,188
I haven't decided yet.

308
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,482
I'll study them.

309
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:57,317
When you get more files,
I'd like to see them, too.

310
00:27:57,401 --> 00:28:00,820
You can call me. When I have to call
my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.

311
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:04,199
Would you like to leave me
your home phone number?

312
00:28:04,742 --> 00:28:05,784
No.

313
00:28:07,745 --> 00:28:08,828
Do you know
how you caught me?

314
00:28:08,913 --> 00:28:10,789
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can
leave messages for me.

315
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:14,125
LECKTOR: Do you know
how you caught me?

316
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:17,587
The reason you caught me,
Will, is we're just alike.

317
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:19,506
Do you understand?

318
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:22,926
Smell yourself.

319
00:29:41,341 --> 00:29:42,341
Gotcha.

320
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:47,555
WOMAN ON PA: ...217
now boarding at Gate 1 2.

321
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:53,604
Eastern Airlines Flight 217 is now
ready for boarding at Gate 1 2.

322
00:30:00,153 --> 00:30:02,112
Get up against the bunk
and face the wall.

323
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:05,783
Don't turn around, or I'll Mace you
in the face.

324
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:20,547
Thank you so much.

325
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:22,217
I'll call you when I'm finished.

326
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:33,102
FEMALE OPERATOR:
Are you ready for your call?

327
00:30:33,187 --> 00:30:34,646
Yes, thank you.

328
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:39,484
WOMAN 1 : Paltrow, Christiansen &
Golub, Law Offices.

329
00:30:39,568 --> 00:30:41,778
Excuse me.
I must have misdialed.

330
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,166
MALE OPERATOR: Thank you for using AT&T.
This is Operator 24.

331
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:58,546
Operator, I don't
have the use of my arms.

332
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:02,842
Would you be so kind as to
dial a number for me, please?

333
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:04,844
Certainly. What's the number?

334
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:06,637
Area code 301 ,

335
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:10,516
555-6624.

336
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:16,772
WOMAN 2: The University of Chicago,
Department of Psychiatry.

337
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:18,732
Dr. Sidney Bloom, please.

338
00:31:18,817 --> 00:31:21,111
He's not in, but I'll connect you
to his office.

339
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:22,612
What's his secretary's name again?

340
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:25,282
Martha King. Just a moment, please.

341
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:27,909
WOMAN 3: Martha King's desk.

342
00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:28,994
Hi, Martha.

343
00:31:29,328 --> 00:31:31,288
Martha doesn't come in nights.

344
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,040
Maybe you can help me.

345
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,710
This is Bob Greer of Blaine &
Edwards publishing company,

346
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,879
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy

347
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,714
of The Psychiatrist and the Law
to someone.

348
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,341
Martha never sent me the address
and phone number.

349
00:31:43,426 --> 00:31:44,885
She'll be in in the morning.

350
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:48,389
Well, I've got to catch Federal
Express in about five minutes.

351
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,601
I'd be immensely appreciative if you
could pull it out of her Rolodex for me.

352
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:53,019
I don't see a Rolodex.

353
00:31:53,103 --> 00:31:55,813
I'll bet she has a call caddy
right next to her phone.

354
00:31:55,898 --> 00:31:57,690
Yeah... Well, zip that little pointer

355
00:31:57,774 --> 00:31:59,942
right on down to the letter G.

356
00:32:00,027 --> 00:32:01,152
All right.

357
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:04,488
The name we're looking for,
last name Graham,

358
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:06,240
the man the book is supposed
to be sent to,

359
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,784
a Mr. Will Graham.

360
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:11,871
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation,
10th and Pennsylvania,

361
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:13,205
Washington, D.C.

362
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,251
Now, I'll bet it has his
home address there, too.

363
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:20,839
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.

364
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:24,843
Thank you so very much.

365
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:30,182
I've finished.

366
00:34:11,954 --> 00:34:13,371
Mom!
Oh, my gosh.

367
00:34:13,456 --> 00:34:15,291
It's all right. Stewardess!

368
00:34:29,598 --> 00:34:30,681
CAPTAIN ON PA SYSTEM:
Ladies and gentlemen,

369
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:33,476
we are beginning our descent
into Birmingham.

370
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:36,519
WILL: You used a cutting tool on
the branch so that you could see.

371
00:36:36,604 --> 00:36:38,771
Then you passed the time whittling

372
00:36:39,815 --> 00:36:41,525
and dreaming.

373
00:36:43,528 --> 00:36:45,029
When night came,

374
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:48,782
you saw them pass by their bright windows.

375
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:51,785
Then you watched the shades go down,

376
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:55,372
then you saw the lights go out,
one by one.

377
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:57,917
Then after a while, you climbed down

378
00:36:58,001 --> 00:37:00,211
and you went in to them, didn't you?

379
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:01,378
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?

380
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:04,298
You watched them all goddamned day long!

381
00:37:07,552 --> 00:37:09,678
That's why houses with big yards.

382
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:17,687
WILL: I need Firearms and Tool Marks
section out here on a severed branch.

383
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:19,439
I need to know what kind
of cutting tool he used.

384
00:37:19,523 --> 00:37:21,608
And then I need Bowman in Documents
to fall on this carving.

385
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:22,692
JACK: Is it weird?

386
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:24,027
The mark? Yeah.

387
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,905
If Documents can't do the carving,
I'll send it up to Langley.

388
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:28,907
WILL: Did Price get an identification
off the Leeds print?

389
00:37:28,991 --> 00:37:30,867
No, Price hasn't found him in the index yet.

390
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:33,453
It's a hand search. He's got half
his department on it.

391
00:37:33,537 --> 00:37:36,081
Listen, have you seen this week's Tattler?

392
00:37:36,332 --> 00:37:38,750
It's not on my
preferred reading list.

393
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:39,919
Well,

394
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:42,380
your picture's all over the front page.

395
00:37:44,466 --> 00:37:45,424
Who the hell was it? Lounds?

396
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:46,926
Of course. Who else?

397
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,886
God damn it, Jack!

398
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:51,597
I promised Molly!
I promised her!

399
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:54,976
Come in.

400
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:56,686
GUARD: Dr. Chilton?

401
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:58,396
Yes?

402
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,439
When we were cleaning
out Dr. Lecktor's cell,

403
00:38:00,524 --> 00:38:02,358
he heard us coming and hid
something in a book.

404
00:38:02,442 --> 00:38:03,734
We got him out of there
and dug around.

405
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:05,569
Is that it?
Yes.

406
00:38:05,654 --> 00:38:07,989
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.

407
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:17,374
Has anyone else seen this except you?

408
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,209
No.

409
00:38:22,463 --> 00:38:24,214
SECRETARY: Special Agent
Crawford's office.

410
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:25,465
This is Dr. Chilton.

411
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,259
I need to speak to Mr. Graham
right away.

412
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:28,760
He's not here, he's in Birmingham.

413
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:30,804
Special Agent Crawford
is on the line with him now.

414
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:32,973
Please tell them this is very,
very urgent.

415
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:34,057
I'll hold on.

416
00:38:37,855 --> 00:38:39,230
Dr. Chilton,
it's Jack Crawford.

417
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:40,815
You have Will Graham
on the line, too.

418
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:43,985
CHILTON: I have a note,
or two pieces of a note

419
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:46,863
that appears to be from that man
who killed those people in Atlanta.

420
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:48,698
Where did you get it?

421
00:38:48,782 --> 00:38:50,825
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.

422
00:38:50,909 --> 00:38:54,078
WILL: Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?

423
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:56,372
It's written on toilet tissue.

424
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:59,417
"My dear Dr. Lecktor,

425
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:03,546
"I wanted to tell you I'm delighted
that you've taken an interest in me.

426
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,343
"I know that you alone can
understand what I am becoming.

427
00:39:07,594 --> 00:39:11,847
"You alone know the people I use
to help me in these things

428
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:14,600
"are only elements undergoing change

429
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:18,520
"to fuel the radiance of what
I am becoming,

430
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:21,482
"just as the source of light is burning.

431
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:25,611
"I have a collection of your
press clippings.

432
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:28,697
"I think they are absurd, as are mine.

433
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,785
"'The Tooth Fairy,' what could be
more inappropriate?

434
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,038
"Investigator Graham interests me,

435
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,083
"very purposeful-looking.

436
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,794
"I hope we can correspond."

437
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,337
There's a piece missing here.

438
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,172
Now I'll read the bottom part.

439
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,674
"After I hear back from you,

440
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,885
"I might send you something wet."

441
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,512
Signed "Avid Fan."

442
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,224
It has teeth marks pressed into it
at the bottom.

443
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,102
Order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.

444
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,062
Two, call Alabama
Air National Guard,

445
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,022
get Graham back here right now.

446
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,066
Then call Documents and tell them
to scramble a team.

447
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,403
I want everybody moving
five minutes ago. You understand?

448
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,321
JACK: I have a Documents
team on its way to you

449
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:08,781
by helicopter to pick up the note.

450
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,241
Listen, after we've worked the note,

451
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,659
I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell.

452
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,244
I don't want Lecktor to know
that we've found it,

453
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,287
he might try to warn the killer somehow.

454
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:16,372
Where's Lecktor now?

455
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,581
CHILTON: Holding cell.

456
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,917
How long can you keep him in there
without him getting suspicious?

457
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,961
CHILTON: Three, four hours.

458
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,088
Brian, we have a note
coming in on the flight,

459
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,841
possibly from the Tooth Fairy,
number one priority.

460
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,092
It has to go to Hair and Fiber,

461
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,427
Latent Prints, and then Documents.

462
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,387
Will Graham and I
will be walking it through.

463
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:13,681
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.

464
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,517
And a couple of blue grains.

465
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:18,811
Work the hair.

466
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:20,855
What do we have
for negative comparison?

467
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:25,151
Hair from Lecktor's comb, whiskers
from Lecktor's razor they let him use.

468
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:27,820
This is hair from
the security guard.

469
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:51,595
MAN: How many guys
handled this without gloves?

470
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,472
The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.

471
00:41:53,556 --> 00:41:55,349
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks

472
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:58,435
probably had the oil
washed off his fingers.

473
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:00,646
But the others. . .

474
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:01,939
One smudge.

475
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:07,111
Those aren't ridges.

476
00:42:07,196 --> 00:42:09,781
It's just the texture of the paper.

477
00:42:09,865 --> 00:42:11,032
I can fume for a print,

478
00:42:11,116 --> 00:42:13,368
but can't guarantee the iodine
stains would fade out.

479
00:42:13,452 --> 00:42:14,869
Ninhydrin? Boost it with heat?

480
00:42:14,954 --> 00:42:15,995
No.

481
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,331
We couldn't wash it after.

482
00:42:18,415 --> 00:42:21,292
I can't get a print off this in the
time you've got to get it back, Will.

483
00:42:22,169 --> 00:42:23,211
BOWMAN: How long do I have?

484
00:42:23,295 --> 00:42:24,295
JACK: Twenty minutes, max.

485
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,547
BOWMAN: The main thing to find out is,

486
00:42:25,631 --> 00:42:28,007
how was Lecktor supposed
to reply to him?

487
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:30,885
Which is probably the missing section,
because at the top it says,

488
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:34,098
"I hope we can correspond,"
then comes the gap.

489
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:38,477
This note was written
in ballpoint,

490
00:42:39,062 --> 00:42:42,648
but it looks like Lecktor went over
this area with a felt-tip pen,

491
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:45,067
then tore it away.

492
00:43:13,514 --> 00:43:16,099
You're so sly,

493
00:43:16,183 --> 00:43:17,934
but so am I.

494
00:43:25,192 --> 00:43:29,904
The aniline dyes used in the ink
of the felt-tip pens like Lecktor used

495
00:43:29,989 --> 00:43:32,158
are transparent to infrared.

496
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,036
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.

497
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:45,880
This looks like the tip
of a T here, here, and here.

498
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,841
At the end is what could be the
top of an R.

499
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,135
There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler."

500
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:52,303
We know our boy reads it.

501
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:54,013
The article about me and Lecktor.

502
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:56,641
I don't know anybody else that's
carried that.

503
00:43:57,517 --> 00:43:58,809
Personal ads.

504
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:05,150
We believe the Tooth Fairy
told Lecktor to reply to him

505
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:08,111
through the personal ad section of
the National Tattler.

506
00:44:08,196 --> 00:44:11,239
The Chicago office is down there
right now running through their ads.

507
00:44:11,324 --> 00:44:13,492
We have cut into a line of communication

508
00:44:13,576 --> 00:44:15,661
between the Tooth Fairy
and Lecktor.

509
00:44:15,745 --> 00:44:18,455
If we find Lecktor's
reply we plan to pull it,

510
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:20,540
substitute it with one of our own.

511
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:23,418
And this is what the Tooth Fairy
will read. Bill?

512
00:44:23,503 --> 00:44:27,422
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle
and surpass my achievements.

513
00:44:27,507 --> 00:44:30,718
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore
Central Left Luggage.

514
00:44:30,803 --> 00:44:32,929
"Ticket number 72683."

515
00:44:33,597 --> 00:44:35,640
It's a Secret Service
letter drop.

516
00:44:35,724 --> 00:44:36,849
We plan to stake it out.

517
00:44:36,934 --> 00:44:38,017
When he shows, we'll grab him.

518
00:44:38,102 --> 00:44:39,852
Anything from Chicago?
SARAH: Not yet.

519
00:44:39,937 --> 00:44:41,854
When do they go to press?

520
00:44:41,939 --> 00:44:43,356
JACK: Thirty-five minutes.

521
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,149
Christ. Let's get to the physical.

522
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:46,776
There was no print.

523
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,611
Scale counts and core size
of the hair

524
00:44:48,696 --> 00:44:51,114
match the blond hair found
in the Jacobis'.

525
00:44:51,198 --> 00:44:53,616
That note was written by your man.

526
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:56,035
Aside from the hair, three blue grains,

527
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,996
dark flecks, went to Brian's end.

528
00:44:58,081 --> 00:45:00,708
The grains are commercial granulated
cleanser with chlorine,

529
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:01,750
from the cleaning man.

530
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:04,169
Several particles of dried blood,
but not enough to type.

531
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:08,424
OVER PHONE: This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?

532
00:45:08,508 --> 00:45:10,050
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.

533
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:13,762
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in
it being telexed to you right now.

534
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:15,806
Read it. "Dear Avid Fan,

535
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,516
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."

536
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,684
JACK: Oh, Christ.

537
00:45:18,768 --> 00:45:21,145
"I offer 100 prayers for your
safety.

538
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:26,692
"Find help in Galatians
6:11, 15:2,

539
00:45:26,776 --> 00:45:30,739
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,

540
00:45:31,657 --> 00:45:35,160
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,

541
00:45:35,786 --> 00:45:37,495
"Luke 1:7."

542
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:39,247
JACK: Thanks.

543
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:47,088
Jimmy.

544
00:45:47,173 --> 00:45:49,257
Did you get anywhere at all identifying
him off the Leeds' prints?

545
00:45:49,341 --> 00:45:50,508
Not yet.

546
00:45:53,846 --> 00:45:55,388
Photography at Langley?

547
00:45:55,473 --> 00:45:58,017
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.

548
00:46:12,032 --> 00:46:15,117
No. And our ad has to go out in
the same book code Lecktor used,

549
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:16,619
or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor
talking to him.

550
00:46:16,703 --> 00:46:17,787
Book code?

551
00:46:17,871 --> 00:46:19,413
"100 prayers" could
be the page number,

552
00:46:19,498 --> 00:46:20,915
the paired numbers could be
line and letter.

553
00:46:20,999 --> 00:46:22,166
But what book?
JACK: Not the Bible?

554
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,250
No.

555
00:46:23,335 --> 00:46:24,293
Galatians 15:2.

556
00:46:24,377 --> 00:46:25,879
Galatians only
has six chapters.

557
00:46:25,963 --> 00:46:26,963
The same with Jonah 6:8.

558
00:46:27,048 --> 00:46:28,632
Jonah only has four chapters.

559
00:46:28,716 --> 00:46:30,717
Lecktor was not using the Bible.

560
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:33,887
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named
the book in the part Lecktor tore out.

561
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:35,388
Right.

562
00:46:36,057 --> 00:46:37,933
What about sweating Lecktor?

563
00:46:38,017 --> 00:46:40,060
They tried sodium amytal on him
three years ago to find where

564
00:46:40,144 --> 00:46:41,394
he buried a Princeton student.

565
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:42,854
He gave them a recipe
for potato chip dip.

566
00:46:42,939 --> 00:46:44,022
JACK: Wonderful.

567
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,735
The Tooth Fairy would have named a
book he knew Lecktor has access to.

568
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,529
He'd know it from articles he'd
read about Lecktor.

569
00:46:50,613 --> 00:46:52,072
JACK: Willingham,
when he tossed his cell,

570
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:54,032
took Polaroids so they can
get everything back in place.

571
00:46:54,116 --> 00:46:56,744
Have him meet me with pictures
of Lecktor's books.

572
00:46:56,829 --> 00:46:58,663
JACK: Where?
BOWMAN: Library of Congress.

573
00:47:05,087 --> 00:47:07,171
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.

574
00:47:07,256 --> 00:47:10,299
Lecktor's ad runs as is,
we decode it later.

575
00:47:10,384 --> 00:47:14,512
Or we pull it, figure out the
code and run our own ad next week.

576
00:47:14,596 --> 00:47:15,555
And lose a week?

577
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:16,681
We got 17 days till the next full moon.

578
00:47:16,765 --> 00:47:20,434
And I don't like Lecktor's ad
running without knowing what it says.

579
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:23,771
It's your call, Will.

580
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:27,943
Run it.

581
00:47:28,945 --> 00:47:32,990
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy
to do something else beside write?

582
00:47:33,074 --> 00:47:35,325
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.

583
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,745
JACK: And if Bowman still can't
figure it out?

584
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,373
Then we'll bait him with something
else in next week's Tattler.

585
00:47:41,457 --> 00:47:42,958
JACK: What, for instance?

586
00:47:45,503 --> 00:47:46,628
Me.

587
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:50,757
I don't think that's a very good idea.

588
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:55,972
Why not?

589
00:47:56,056 --> 00:47:57,390
Don't you think we can provoke him?

590
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,809
Maybe. Maybe he can be provoked.

591
00:47:59,894 --> 00:48:01,477
What I was thinking about is you.

592
00:48:03,355 --> 00:48:05,189
You're getting deeper and deeper
into this.

593
00:48:05,274 --> 00:48:06,774
Good night.

594
00:48:06,859 --> 00:48:07,859
Sidney.

595
00:48:07,943 --> 00:48:08,985
I'll talk to you.

596
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:12,906
Last time you did that you did
a real good job

597
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,283
of pushing yourself all out of shape.

598
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,494
You try it on again or you go
through some big trauma,

599
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:20,747
you could relapse, my friend.

600
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,958
Sidney, don't worry about me.

601
00:48:23,043 --> 00:48:26,211
I'm working the evidence, making
moves. That's all.

602
00:48:27,547 --> 00:48:28,797
I'm fine.

603
00:48:31,343 --> 00:48:33,177
Bowman just struck out.

604
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:35,638
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.

605
00:48:36,306 --> 00:48:37,264
Price?

606
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:38,682
He just heard. It's a bust-out.

607
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:41,268
As evidence, the Leeds print
will get us a conviction

608
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:43,228
if we could ever find the guy.

609
00:48:43,313 --> 00:48:46,565
But he must never have been printed
because he is not in our index.

610
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:49,151
We are not gonna identify him
off the print.

611
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:54,324
I'll use Lounds.

612
00:48:55,284 --> 00:48:56,534
What for?

613
00:48:57,286 --> 00:48:59,537
Our boy doesn't read the
New York Times literary supplement.

614
00:48:59,622 --> 00:49:01,623
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.

615
00:49:07,505 --> 00:49:08,672
What else should we cover?

616
00:49:08,756 --> 00:49:11,633
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds
after he was dead.

617
00:49:11,717 --> 00:49:15,220
I believe he did this to make sure
we wouldn't think he was gay.

618
00:49:18,724 --> 00:49:21,060
He's molested all of his male victims.

619
00:49:21,561 --> 00:49:24,480
He may be impotent with members
of the opposite sex.

620
00:49:24,982 --> 00:49:27,108
Our forensic psychologists have projected,

621
00:49:27,192 --> 00:49:29,068
though I'm not sure,

622
00:49:29,152 --> 00:49:31,821
that he may have had sexual
relations with his mother.

623
00:49:37,786 --> 00:49:40,997
So, how long do you plan to stay
in Washington?

624
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:42,498
Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.

625
00:49:42,582 --> 00:49:44,750
LOUNDS: Can the Tattler rely on
getting the straight stuff from you?

626
00:49:44,835 --> 00:49:45,835
Absolutely.

627
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:48,462
How does working on this case affect
your sex life?

628
00:49:48,547 --> 00:49:52,009
Mine? It doesn't affect mine, it
affects yours. Go fuck yourself.

629
00:49:52,093 --> 00:49:53,593
Look, pal of mine, you're news.

630
00:49:53,678 --> 00:49:55,137
Shoot the pictures.

631
00:49:55,221 --> 00:49:56,930
All right, Symie, let's shoot them.

632
00:49:57,015 --> 00:49:58,181
I'm in the shots with Graham.

633
00:49:58,266 --> 00:49:59,850
What? I'm in the shots with you.

634
00:49:59,934 --> 00:50:02,519
Come on, you want this to look real
or not?

635
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:08,025
Make sure the theater sign across the
street is just slightly out of focus.

636
00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:09,818
We want him to be able to
read it so he can find it,

637
00:50:09,902 --> 00:50:10,902
but we don't want to look too obvious.

638
00:50:10,987 --> 00:50:14,156
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.

639
00:50:15,992 --> 00:50:17,034
One more.

640
00:50:17,326 --> 00:50:19,119
One more.
That's enough.

641
00:50:19,287 --> 00:50:21,914
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?

642
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:23,666
Let's have lunch,
call my service.

643
00:50:23,751 --> 00:50:25,752
Crawford, always a thrill.

644
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:29,088
Dr. Bloom. I need them on my
desk in two hours.

645
00:50:38,307 --> 00:50:39,390
Did Bowman break the code yet?

646
00:50:39,475 --> 00:50:40,475
No.

647
00:50:40,726 --> 00:50:43,853
Tools and Firearms say the cutting
tool used on the severed branch

648
00:50:43,937 --> 00:50:45,897
was a common bolt cutter.

649
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:48,776
I got a call from Asian Studies
at Langley.

650
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,611
The mark you found on the tree?
Yeah?

651
00:50:50,695 --> 00:50:54,740
It's a Chinese character considered
a lucky sign in gambling.

652
00:50:54,824 --> 00:50:57,910
That same character appears on
a Mah Jongg piece.

653
00:50:57,994 --> 00:51:01,038
It means "Red Dragon."
Mean anything to you?

654
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:05,084
No.

655
00:51:08,171 --> 00:51:10,589
If he shows, and he's smart,

656
00:51:10,673 --> 00:51:13,092
he'll approach you from the front,
pass, turn,

657
00:51:13,176 --> 00:51:15,010
try and take you from behind.

658
00:51:15,095 --> 00:51:16,178
How's your hearing?

659
00:51:16,262 --> 00:51:17,262
It's good.

660
00:51:17,347 --> 00:51:18,473
You'll wear a wire, one-way.

661
00:51:18,557 --> 00:51:21,267
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.

662
00:51:21,936 --> 00:51:24,062
You checked out a Charter Arms
.44 Special Bulldog?

663
00:51:24,146 --> 00:51:25,146
Yeah.

664
00:51:25,231 --> 00:51:27,607
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?

665
00:51:27,691 --> 00:51:28,650
Glaser Safety Slugs.

666
00:51:28,734 --> 00:51:29,943
Yeah. Number 12 shots.

667
00:51:30,027 --> 00:51:32,779
Suspended in liquid Teflon in a
copper casing.

668
00:51:32,863 --> 00:51:35,323
On impact it all opens up in the target.

669
00:51:35,407 --> 00:51:37,367
Guaranteed one-shot stop.

670
00:51:37,868 --> 00:51:38,910
You got body armor?

671
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:41,121
Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.

672
00:51:41,205 --> 00:51:42,247
I hope you get one.

673
00:51:42,331 --> 00:51:45,542
'Cause he's gone for the head shot
eight of eleven times?

674
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,879
Let's walk the route.

675
00:52:11,778 --> 00:52:15,156
WOMAN ON PA: United Flight 849 to
Newark now boarding at Gate 7...

676
00:52:15,574 --> 00:52:18,326
United Flight 849 to Newark now
boarding at Gate 7.

677
00:53:27,482 --> 00:53:28,982
Someone's coming.

678
00:53:59,807 --> 00:54:00,890
Go!

679
00:54:07,439 --> 00:54:09,232
Don't! Don't move!

680
00:54:15,156 --> 00:54:16,782
Take the money!

681
00:54:17,117 --> 00:54:18,951
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

682
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,245
Clear!

683
00:54:29,629 --> 00:54:32,298
What you moving in slow motion for, man?
I'm being mugged!

684
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:34,967
For real.
Can you believe that?

685
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:37,386
Pay up.

686
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:41,265
RADIO ANNOUNCER: ...in sports,
the Cubs lost again.

687
00:54:42,392 --> 00:54:43,393
Hey!

688
00:55:24,936 --> 00:55:26,312
You know who I am?

689
00:55:27,022 --> 00:55:29,106
I don't want to know who you are.

690
00:55:30,692 --> 00:55:33,069
According to you,
I'm a sexual pervert.

691
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,363
"An animal," you said.

692
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:40,994
You know who I am now?

693
00:55:42,955 --> 00:55:44,081
Yes.

694
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:47,793
Do you feel privileged?

695
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:53,840
I'm very scared.

696
00:55:57,428 --> 00:55:58,804
Open your eyes.

697
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,973
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.

698
00:56:03,768 --> 00:56:06,436
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.

699
00:56:06,521 --> 00:56:07,521
And if you don't open your eyes,

700
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:10,608
I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.

701
00:56:17,866 --> 00:56:22,120
Well, here I am.

702
00:56:39,346 --> 00:56:40,889
Look at the screen.

703
00:56:42,183 --> 00:56:44,560
William Blake's The Great Red Dragon

704
00:56:44,644 --> 00:56:46,854
and the Woman Clothed In The Rays Of The Sun.

705
00:56:46,938 --> 00:56:48,730
Do you see?
Yes.

706
00:56:51,025 --> 00:56:52,609
Mrs. Leeds. Do you see?

707
00:56:52,694 --> 00:56:53,694
Yes.

708
00:56:55,113 --> 00:56:57,739
Mrs. Jacobi. Do you see?

709
00:56:58,032 --> 00:56:59,283
Yes.

710
00:57:01,828 --> 00:57:04,621
The next family as they will look
when I go to visit them.

711
00:57:04,706 --> 00:57:06,540
Do you see?
Yes.

712
00:57:08,878 --> 00:57:11,880
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.

713
00:57:13,507 --> 00:57:14,549
Yes.

714
00:57:16,844 --> 00:57:19,429
Mrs. Jacobi
after her changing.

715
00:57:21,056 --> 00:57:22,765
The Dragon rampant.

716
00:57:26,979 --> 00:57:30,064
Freddie Lounds, your photograph.

717
00:57:31,275 --> 00:57:32,317
No.

718
00:57:32,401 --> 00:57:33,443
No what?

719
00:57:33,527 --> 00:57:34,986
Not me, please.

720
00:57:36,739 --> 00:57:37,697
Please.

721
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:38,908
Are you a man?

722
00:57:39,743 --> 00:57:41,410
Yes.

723
00:57:41,786 --> 00:57:43,954
Do you imply that I'm queer?

724
00:57:44,498 --> 00:57:45,748
God, no.

725
00:57:47,584 --> 00:57:50,419
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.

726
00:57:50,504 --> 00:57:53,881
You are privy to a great becoming,
and you recognize nothing.

727
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:57,092
You are an ant in the afterbirth.

728
00:57:57,719 --> 00:58:00,262
It is your nature to do one thing correctly,

729
00:58:00,472 --> 00:58:01,597
tremble.

730
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,600
But fear is not what you owe me.

731
00:58:04,684 --> 00:58:07,102
No, Lounds, you and the others,

732
00:58:07,188 --> 00:58:09,231
you owe me awe.

733
00:58:16,489 --> 00:58:19,032
We have one more piece of work to do.

734
00:58:21,035 --> 00:58:23,787
If he takes off the mask,
I am a dead man.

735
00:58:30,086 --> 00:58:31,628
Open your eyes.

736
00:58:34,715 --> 00:58:36,216
Open your eyes!

737
00:58:38,345 --> 00:58:41,639
You will read this into the
tape recorder.

738
00:58:42,724 --> 00:58:43,891
Go.

739
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:46,143
"I have had a great privilege.

740
00:58:46,228 --> 00:58:50,398
"I have seen with wonder and awe
the strength of the Red Dragon.

741
00:58:50,482 --> 00:58:52,858
"All I wrote about him were lies.

742
00:58:52,943 --> 00:58:54,902
"Will Graham made me write them

743
00:58:54,987 --> 00:58:58,573
"to pull him into a trap in
Washington, District of Columbia.

744
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:01,075
"Will Graham, you will learn
from my own lips

745
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:04,745
"how much you have to dread
because I was forced to lie.

746
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:08,250
"He will be more merciful to me
than to you.

747
00:59:08,334 --> 00:59:12,629
"You will lie awake in fear of what
the Red Dragon will do.

748
00:59:12,714 --> 00:59:15,757
"I will be a testament to the
truth of this."

749
00:59:22,765 --> 00:59:24,182
You did very well.

750
00:59:26,811 --> 00:59:28,437
Will you let me go now?

751
00:59:28,688 --> 00:59:30,105
Please?

752
00:59:31,232 --> 00:59:33,567
You will tell the truth?

753
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:34,944
I promise.

754
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,281
Good.

755
00:59:42,953 --> 00:59:45,163
We'll seal your promise with...

756
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,395
We'll seal your promise

757
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,944
with a kiss.

758
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,704
MAN ON RADIO: We'll be showing
five possible answers

759
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,289
to the questions I'll be asking.

760
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,249
Any member of a team may buzz
in an answer,

761
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:32,920
but if incorrect, then the other
team will have the opportunity...

762
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:20,344
Bowman, just skip the cryptography and
tell me what the hell it says, okay?

763
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,305
Did he try to say anything at all?

764
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,807
No, he sure didn't.

765
01:01:30,313 --> 01:01:31,355
He never regained consciousness.

766
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,441
Did you hear the tape?

767
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:33,525
Yeah.

768
01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:37,654
Listen, Bowman just broke the code that
Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.

769
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,406
It was the State of Maryland statutes.

770
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,283
You need to know what it said right now.

771
01:01:41,367 --> 01:01:42,367
What?

772
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:43,618
Listen to me.

773
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:46,747
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.

774
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:50,000
What is it, Jack?

775
01:01:50,793 --> 01:01:53,253
The bastard gave him your home address.

776
01:01:53,546 --> 01:01:56,256
It said, "Graham home,
3860 DeSoto Highway,

777
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:57,758
"Captiva, Florida.

778
01:01:59,135 --> 01:02:00,969
"Save yourself. Kill them all."

779
01:02:01,054 --> 01:02:02,054
Get me a plane.

780
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:03,181
Will!

781
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:08,686
Mom.

782
01:02:10,522 --> 01:02:11,606
Huh?

783
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:13,441
What time... What?

784
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:15,318
Someone's outside.

785
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:16,861
There are noises.

786
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:18,571
Where?
Outside.

787
01:02:31,878 --> 01:02:32,836
Mom. . .

788
01:02:32,921 --> 01:02:34,671
Go back to your room and close the door.

789
01:02:38,551 --> 01:02:41,011
Mom...
Do it now.

790
01:03:28,686 --> 01:03:30,104
Ma'am, are you all right?

791
01:03:30,188 --> 01:03:31,814
What? What is it?

792
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:37,194
What is it?
What's going on?

793
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:39,029
OFFICER: Ma'am, I think you
should come back inside.

794
01:03:39,114 --> 01:03:40,781
What's going on?
Come back inside.

795
01:03:40,866 --> 01:03:43,826
Please. I think you should
come back inside.

796
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:28,497
I'm sorry, Molly.

797
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:31,334
I'm sorry about all of this.

798
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:37,965
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.

799
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:41,677
He's after you now, isn't he?

800
01:04:41,762 --> 01:04:43,012
This is just a precaution.

801
01:04:44,723 --> 01:04:46,766
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water,

802
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,476
check out the dock?

803
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,269
I want to hang around here.

804
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:51,562
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.

805
01:04:51,647 --> 01:04:52,855
Okay.

806
01:04:55,901 --> 01:04:57,361
What is that about?

807
01:04:59,238 --> 01:05:02,616
What, he's afraid to leave you alone
with me now?

808
01:05:03,117 --> 01:05:05,285
He saw the article in the Tattler,
right?

809
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:06,662
I wanted to talk with him about it,

810
01:05:06,746 --> 01:05:10,290
but he said he wanted to bring it up to you,
face to face.

811
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:11,959
Good for him.

812
01:05:12,502 --> 01:05:14,127
Kevin, help me unpack, will you?

813
01:05:14,212 --> 01:05:16,088
Then we'll go get some groceries.

814
01:05:27,601 --> 01:05:29,894
You and Mom are very well-protected,
you know.

815
01:05:29,979 --> 01:05:32,397
No one's gonna find out where you are.

816
01:05:32,481 --> 01:05:35,316
KEVIN: Is there anything I need
to know to see about Mom?

817
01:05:36,026 --> 01:05:37,068
No.

818
01:05:37,736 --> 01:05:40,029
KEVIN: This guy is trying to kill us?

819
01:05:40,447 --> 01:05:42,240
We don't know that.

820
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,034
When are you going to kill him?

821
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:50,665
I'm not.

822
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:52,959
It's only my job to find him.

823
01:05:56,673 --> 01:05:58,674
Barry's mom had this newspaper.

824
01:05:58,842 --> 01:06:01,260
It said you were in a special hospital.

825
01:06:04,389 --> 01:06:06,557
Well, it was a regular hospital,

826
01:06:06,933 --> 01:06:10,269
then I was transferred into the
psychiatric wing.

827
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:13,647
That bothers you, doesn't it?

828
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:16,108
I don't know.

829
01:06:16,943 --> 01:06:20,320
Was it because in the papers it said
it was this man Lecktor?

830
01:06:20,864 --> 01:06:22,114
Mmm-hmm.

831
01:06:22,782 --> 01:06:24,409
What happened?

832
01:06:25,327 --> 01:06:29,456
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls,
then he killed them.

833
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:32,042
How?

834
01:06:33,836 --> 01:06:35,545
In bad ways.

835
01:06:38,007 --> 01:06:39,799
He was a psychiatrist.

836
01:06:40,468 --> 01:06:42,385
One of the girls was his patient,

837
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:44,387
and I went to talk to him about her.

838
01:06:47,391 --> 01:06:51,394
I tried to build feelings in my imagination
like the killer had

839
01:06:51,479 --> 01:06:54,190
so that I would know why he did
what he did,

840
01:06:54,274 --> 01:06:56,692
because that would help me find him.

841
01:06:57,611 --> 01:06:59,737
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office

842
01:06:59,821 --> 01:07:02,490
and I looked up, I saw a book
on his shelf.

843
01:07:02,574 --> 01:07:04,784
It had pictures of war wounds in it.

844
01:07:05,911 --> 01:07:07,620
And I knew it was him.

845
01:07:09,206 --> 01:07:12,833
So I went to a pay phone down
the hall to call the police

846
01:07:13,919 --> 01:07:16,170
and that's when he attacked me.

847
01:07:20,675 --> 01:07:23,470
You and Mom came to see me
in the hospital,

848
01:07:23,554 --> 01:07:25,180
and that helped a lot.

849
01:07:26,682 --> 01:07:29,184
But after my body got okay,

850
01:07:30,019 --> 01:07:33,355
I still had his thoughts going
around in my head.

851
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:37,692
And I stopped talking to people.

852
01:07:40,655 --> 01:07:44,491
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom,
asked me to get some help.

853
01:07:44,951 --> 01:07:46,201
And I did.

854
01:07:46,911 --> 01:07:50,539
Then after a while I felt better,
and I was okay again.

855
01:07:54,878 --> 01:07:57,630
And the way
he thought felt that bad?

856
01:07:58,924 --> 01:08:00,675
Kevin,

857
01:08:00,759 --> 01:08:04,053
they're the ugliest thoughts
in the world.

858
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:22,072
So, what kind of coffee do you like?

859
01:08:25,243 --> 01:08:27,578
You like that Folgers stuff, right?

860
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,288
Yeah.

861
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:32,249
Mom likes that, too.

862
01:08:36,296 --> 01:08:38,338
When can we go home, Dad?

863
01:08:40,508 --> 01:08:42,050
I don't know, Kevin.

864
01:08:58,027 --> 01:08:59,777
So, where are things?

865
01:09:01,071 --> 01:09:02,488
Nowhere.

866
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:08,244
Everything we've tried is either
a dead end or it's backfired.

867
01:09:08,329 --> 01:09:12,332
Crawford's already planning the next
crime scene so they can get it fresh.

868
01:09:14,752 --> 01:09:18,213
We've got about six more days
till the next full moon.

869
01:09:18,631 --> 01:09:20,132
Can you quit?

870
01:09:20,884 --> 01:09:22,176
No.

871
01:09:26,264 --> 01:09:27,681
What's next?

872
01:09:30,185 --> 01:09:31,810
I go to Atlanta.

873
01:09:31,895 --> 01:09:33,520
Crawford?

874
01:09:33,605 --> 01:09:34,813
No.

875
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:40,986
I have to be alone.

876
01:09:45,367 --> 01:09:47,076
You're talking about doing
exactly what you said you...

877
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,330
This killing, it's gotta stop.

878
01:10:19,069 --> 01:10:23,114
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.

879
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:35,084
You and Kevin should go to Montana.

880
01:10:36,378 --> 01:10:37,628
See your dad.

881
01:10:37,713 --> 01:10:39,672
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.

882
01:10:41,758 --> 01:10:44,510
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.

883
01:11:13,249 --> 01:11:15,334
VALERIE ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.

884
01:11:15,418 --> 01:11:19,172
Sorry I can't come
to the phone right now.

885
01:11:20,632 --> 01:11:21,716
I'm sorry, too.

886
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,884
WAITRESS: Excuse me.

887
01:11:24,303 --> 01:11:25,553
Coffee.

888
01:11:35,314 --> 01:11:37,690
It's just you
and me now, sport.

889
01:11:39,651 --> 01:11:42,028
I'm gonna find you,
God damn it.

890
01:12:02,509 --> 01:12:03,509
Mr. Dollarhyde?

891
01:12:03,593 --> 01:12:04,718
Eileen.

892
01:12:04,803 --> 01:12:07,054
Bill told me to tell you
there was a variation

893
01:12:07,138 --> 01:12:09,264
in the gamma of number three.

894
01:12:09,682 --> 01:12:11,725
But he caught it in time.

895
01:12:15,648 --> 01:12:16,648
Eileen,

896
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:20,068
good. Good.

897
01:13:15,501 --> 01:13:16,460
REBA: Who's there?

898
01:13:16,544 --> 01:13:17,586
Mr. Dollarhyde.

899
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:19,880
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.

900
01:13:19,964 --> 01:13:22,007
REBA: Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.

901
01:13:30,683 --> 01:13:31,766
Put your back against the door.

902
01:13:31,851 --> 01:13:34,186
There's a stool just to your right.

903
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:37,564
You're the production controller
from Admin, right?

904
01:13:38,065 --> 01:13:41,318
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?

905
01:13:41,402 --> 01:13:43,988
Shooting from maybe eight feet.

906
01:13:44,072 --> 01:13:45,781
I can't use any lights.

907
01:13:45,866 --> 01:13:47,909
Okay, what's being photographed?

908
01:13:49,036 --> 01:13:51,162
The activities of nocturnal animals.

909
01:13:51,246 --> 01:13:53,039
When do you need it?

910
01:13:53,123 --> 01:13:54,165
Four days.

911
01:13:54,249 --> 01:13:56,751
Okay, let me stick this in the black hole.

912
01:14:02,508 --> 01:14:06,052
1000-C infrared sensitive has
to be handled in total darkness.

913
01:14:06,136 --> 01:14:08,221
Remember to be very careful with it.

914
01:14:08,305 --> 01:14:11,724
But still, it's easier to handle
than the 1200 series.

915
01:14:11,808 --> 01:14:13,727
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering,

916
01:14:13,811 --> 01:14:16,313
I keep the samples straight by touch code.

917
01:14:17,065 --> 01:14:19,775
No, I wasn't wondering.

918
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,403
Reba, I gotta fly. Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde
can drive you home tonight.

919
01:14:23,488 --> 01:14:24,780
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.

920
01:14:24,864 --> 01:14:25,906
RALPH: I can change things around.

921
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:27,032
No, thanks, go on.

922
01:14:27,116 --> 01:14:28,116
Okay.

923
01:14:33,331 --> 01:14:34,623
I'll take you.

924
01:14:34,791 --> 01:14:38,210
No, thanks. I'll order you 1200 feet
of 1000-C in the morning.

925
01:14:39,546 --> 01:14:40,546
Ride with me.

926
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:43,883
Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.

927
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:45,677
Ride with me.

928
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:47,554
It would be because I would like you to.

929
01:14:50,057 --> 01:14:52,809
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.

930
01:14:54,895 --> 01:14:57,063
How did you come to Gateway?

931
01:14:57,147 --> 01:14:58,856
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped

932
01:14:58,941 --> 01:15:03,152
to shape up their employment practices
to get this defense contract.

933
01:15:03,737 --> 01:15:05,071
You worked out well.

934
01:15:05,155 --> 01:15:06,990
Everybody they hired did.

935
01:15:08,659 --> 01:15:10,703
You know, you speak very well.

936
01:15:10,787 --> 01:15:13,205
Although you avoid fricatives
and sibilants.

937
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:14,748
At the Riker Institute for the Blind,

938
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:18,752
I trained in therapy for speech
and hearing-impaired children.

939
01:15:19,504 --> 01:15:21,714
I'll probably go back to it someday.

940
01:15:21,798 --> 01:15:23,007
Mmm-hmm.

941
01:15:24,175 --> 01:15:26,260
You know, if you don't want
to talk, that's okay.

942
01:15:26,344 --> 01:15:28,929
But I hope you will, because you're
very direct, and I like that,

943
01:15:29,014 --> 01:15:31,348
and I like what you have to say.

944
01:15:32,601 --> 01:15:34,518
May I touch your face?

945
01:15:35,854 --> 01:15:38,606
I want to know whether you're
smiling or frowning.

946
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:41,860
I guess I want to know whether
I should be quiet or not.

947
01:15:48,701 --> 01:15:50,535
Take my word for it.

948
01:15:50,995 --> 01:15:52,245
I'm smiling.

949
01:15:52,788 --> 01:15:54,998
I didn't mean to offend you.

950
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,209
On the way, can I take you somewhere?

951
01:15:58,294 --> 01:15:59,377
Where?

952
01:16:00,755 --> 01:16:02,756
It would be my surprise.

953
01:16:04,091 --> 01:16:05,634
Okay, sure.

954
01:16:22,027 --> 01:16:22,985
Are you apprehensive?

955
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:24,070
No.

956
01:16:24,696 --> 01:16:27,657
The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde
over there is watching us.

957
01:16:27,741 --> 01:16:29,408
No, no, I want to.

958
01:16:30,243 --> 01:16:33,412
In about two hours we're going
to cap his tooth.

959
01:17:31,932 --> 01:17:33,057
REBA: Yeah.

960
01:17:34,309 --> 01:17:35,935
DOCTOR: It's warm.

961
01:17:50,618 --> 01:17:52,995
Back a little bit. There.

962
01:17:54,998 --> 01:17:56,039
You hear it?

963
01:17:56,124 --> 01:17:57,124
Yeah.

964
01:18:24,528 --> 01:18:26,196
You

965
01:18:26,572 --> 01:18:30,116
rearrange the dead families into
an audience to see what you do.

966
01:18:32,077 --> 01:18:36,373
You think that what you do will
make you into something different.

967
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:37,833
You are becoming.

968
01:18:40,337 --> 01:18:42,880
What is it you think you're becoming?

969
01:18:45,884 --> 01:18:48,928
The answer is in the way you use
the mirrors.

970
01:18:54,226 --> 01:18:57,102
What do the mirrors make you
dream you're becoming?

971
01:19:31,222 --> 01:19:33,098
A little to your left.

972
01:19:40,774 --> 01:19:42,108
Francis, that was a great dinner.

973
01:19:42,192 --> 01:19:43,693
Thank you.

974
01:19:45,237 --> 01:19:46,863
I made you a gin and tonic.

975
01:19:46,947 --> 01:19:48,698
It's right in front of you.

976
01:19:51,034 --> 01:19:52,952
What are you watching?

977
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:56,998
It's just a little homework.

978
01:21:27,717 --> 01:21:30,219
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.

979
01:21:42,358 --> 01:21:44,818
Is there a fire in the sky?

980
01:21:45,277 --> 01:21:46,820
Your heart's loud.

981
01:21:46,904 --> 01:21:49,197
Is there a moon up there?

982
01:21:49,281 --> 01:21:51,241
If you'll hold me. . .

983
01:21:51,325 --> 01:21:53,868
Is anything alive now?

984
01:21:55,371 --> 01:21:57,872
This darkness is what I hear

985
01:21:59,918 --> 01:22:03,421
This is a breathless silence

986
01:22:04,256 --> 01:22:06,757
A moment out of time

987
01:22:08,635 --> 01:22:11,345
I see your face in the shadows

988
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:15,933
The tell-tale signs are in your eyes

989
01:22:17,102 --> 01:22:19,770
Aching with a passion inside

990
01:22:22,607 --> 01:22:24,692
Deep as the river

991
01:22:24,776 --> 01:22:27,778
All desire

992
01:22:28,655 --> 01:22:31,783
The ashes and the fire

993
01:22:31,868 --> 01:22:35,120
Turning this night inside

994
01:22:36,289 --> 01:22:38,498
And the light from you

995
01:22:56,809 --> 01:22:59,604
Is there a flame in the dark?

996
01:23:01,148 --> 01:23:03,608
Is there a bright heart star?

997
01:23:05,611 --> 01:23:08,654
These creatures look the same now

998
01:23:09,156 --> 01:23:12,325
We freeze wherever we are

999
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:18,331
We wake alone in the blackness

1000
01:23:18,832 --> 01:23:21,501
We sleep wherever we fall

1001
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:26,089
One dream all around us

1002
01:23:26,173 --> 01:23:29,676
This big hush infects us all

1003
01:23:32,514 --> 01:23:34,848
Forever in this half-light

1004
01:23:34,933 --> 01:23:38,644
All desire

1005
01:23:38,728 --> 01:23:41,939
The ashes and the fire

1006
01:23:42,023 --> 01:23:45,359
Turning this night inside

1007
01:23:47,445 --> 01:23:49,363
And the light from you

1008
01:23:52,492 --> 01:23:55,202
All desire

1009
01:23:56,037 --> 01:23:59,499
The ashes and the fire

1010
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:03,086
Turning this night inside

1011
01:24:04,088 --> 01:24:06,339
And the light from you

1012
01:24:28,864 --> 01:24:30,573
REBA: Is that you, D?
DOLLARHYDE: Are you okay?

1013
01:24:30,657 --> 01:24:31,991
Yeah, I'm fine.

1014
01:24:34,327 --> 01:24:35,411
Hi.

1015
01:24:36,621 --> 01:24:38,247
Good morning.
Morning.

1016
01:24:41,668 --> 01:24:43,878
You know, if you show me where things are,
I'll make us some coffee.

1017
01:24:43,962 --> 01:24:45,045
No, no...

1018
01:24:46,923 --> 01:24:48,424
Don't go back inside the house.

1019
01:24:48,508 --> 01:24:50,342
Why?I left my purse inside.

1020
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:53,137
I'll get it. It's okay.

1021
01:25:00,146 --> 01:25:03,481
I mean, you should stay outside,
it's... It's...

1022
01:25:04,692 --> 01:25:07,485
It's 'cause you look so good in the sun.

1023
01:25:08,487 --> 01:25:09,696
Okay.

1024
01:25:18,372 --> 01:25:20,123
When...

1025
01:25:23,419 --> 01:25:25,755
Reba, when can I see you again?

1026
01:25:26,882 --> 01:25:28,174
Oh! Um...

1027
01:25:30,636 --> 01:25:32,678
We could meet at my house.

1028
01:25:46,318 --> 01:25:47,860
JACK OVER PHONE: You got the
message Lecktor called?

1029
01:25:47,945 --> 01:25:49,528
Yeah. I arranged for him to
have a phone.

1030
01:25:49,613 --> 01:25:50,655
I gotta call him in a few minutes.

1031
01:25:50,739 --> 01:25:53,199
Good. Listen, we identified
the tire tracks left

1032
01:25:53,283 --> 01:25:55,661
when Lounds was delivered back
to the Tattler.

1033
01:25:55,745 --> 01:25:58,163
G-781 6 Goodyear truck tires.

1034
01:25:58,248 --> 01:26:00,332
Looks like our boy drives a van.

1035
01:26:00,416 --> 01:26:02,292
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.

1036
01:26:02,377 --> 01:26:03,502
When are you coming back?

1037
01:26:03,586 --> 01:26:05,379
When I'm done, Jack.

1038
01:26:21,896 --> 01:26:23,606
Yeah, this is Will Graham of the FBI.

1039
01:26:23,691 --> 01:26:26,985
Dr. Chilton arranged for me
to talk to Dr. Lecktor.

1040
01:26:31,532 --> 01:26:32,532
Hello?

1041
01:26:34,994 --> 01:26:36,202
LECKTOR: Hello, Will.

1042
01:26:36,954 --> 01:26:39,539
I wanted to congratulate you for
the job you did on Mr. Lounds.

1043
01:26:39,623 --> 01:26:41,582
I admire that enormously.

1044
01:26:41,667 --> 01:26:43,835
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.

1045
01:26:44,545 --> 01:26:46,296
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches.

1046
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:48,339
You got something to say, say it.

1047
01:26:48,424 --> 01:26:49,882
I want to help you.

1048
01:26:50,884 --> 01:26:53,137
You'd be more comfortable
if you relax with yourself.

1049
01:26:53,221 --> 01:26:55,431
We don't invent our natures,
they're issued to us,

1050
01:26:55,515 --> 01:26:58,809
along with our lungs and pancreas
and everything else.

1051
01:26:59,602 --> 01:27:01,061
Why fight it?

1052
01:27:02,063 --> 01:27:03,314
Fight what?

1053
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,149
Did you really feel so depressed

1054
01:27:05,233 --> 01:27:08,610
after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs
to death?

1055
01:27:09,029 --> 01:27:12,448
I didn't know you then, but I
think you probably did.

1056
01:27:12,532 --> 01:27:15,034
But it wasn't the act that got you down,
was it?

1057
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:18,037
Didn't you really feel so bad
because killing him felt so good?

1058
01:27:18,121 --> 01:27:20,122
And why shouldn't it feel good?

1059
01:27:20,915 --> 01:27:24,336
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.

1060
01:27:25,588 --> 01:27:27,005
God's terrific.

1061
01:27:27,631 --> 01:27:29,841
He dropped a church roof on 34
of his worshippers

1062
01:27:29,925 --> 01:27:31,509
last Wednesday night in Texas

1063
01:27:31,594 --> 01:27:34,721
as they were groveling through a hymn
to his majesty.

1064
01:27:35,097 --> 01:27:37,349
Don't you think that felt good?

1065
01:27:41,437 --> 01:27:43,605
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?

1066
01:27:44,732 --> 01:27:47,984
It feels good, Will,
because God has power.

1067
01:27:49,278 --> 01:27:52,490
And if one does what
God does enough times,

1068
01:27:52,824 --> 01:27:56,118
one will become as God is.

1069
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:04,126
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.

1070
01:28:04,628 --> 01:28:08,464
He got 140 Filipinos in
one plane crash last month.

1071
01:28:08,548 --> 01:28:11,467
Remember that earthquake in ltaly last spring?

1072
01:28:15,055 --> 01:28:16,389
WILL: I enter.

1073
01:28:20,311 --> 01:28:22,187
The glass cutter.

1074
01:28:22,271 --> 01:28:24,898
The piece of glass I take out is mine.

1075
01:28:24,982 --> 01:28:26,650
The house is mine.

1076
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:37,953
I walk up these stairs,

1077
01:28:38,996 --> 01:28:40,872
I pass the children's toys.

1078
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:44,084
The children mean nothing to me.

1079
01:28:45,002 --> 01:28:46,962
They were put here to help me.

1080
01:28:51,176 --> 01:28:52,885
I move to the door.

1081
01:28:57,182 --> 01:28:59,016
I step into the room.

1082
01:29:03,564 --> 01:29:05,189
I see you there.

1083
01:29:08,694 --> 01:29:10,987
And I see me desired by you.

1084
01:29:13,532 --> 01:29:17,577
Accepted and loved

1085
01:29:18,621 --> 01:29:21,623
in the silver mirrors

1086
01:29:22,542 --> 01:29:24,042
of your eyes.

1087
01:30:01,582 --> 01:30:07,295
Father, look in my eyes

1088
01:30:07,588 --> 01:30:14,427
See me as I really am

1089
01:30:15,429 --> 01:30:18,432
You made me

1090
01:30:18,517 --> 01:30:21,810
Now take me

1091
01:30:21,895 --> 01:30:24,313
RALPH: I'm gonna talk to Fogel tomorrow...

1092
01:30:25,649 --> 01:30:30,861
Tell me how it feels now

1093
01:30:30,946 --> 01:30:37,910
Behold your flesh has come of age

1094
01:30:39,162 --> 01:30:40,663
RALPH: Wait a minute.

1095
01:30:40,747 --> 01:30:47,671
Forsake me, you break me

1096
01:30:50,049 --> 01:30:52,342
Strong as I am

1097
01:30:52,426 --> 01:30:56,054
There's something about this
thing that scares me

1098
01:30:56,138 --> 01:30:58,515
Strong as I am

1099
01:30:58,599 --> 01:31:01,893
There's something about
this thing that dares me

1100
01:31:01,978 --> 01:31:04,479
Strong as I am

1101
01:31:04,564 --> 01:31:08,024
There's something about
this thing that haunts me

1102
01:31:08,109 --> 01:31:10,402
Strong as I am

1103
01:31:10,486 --> 01:31:17,368
There's something about
this thing that taunts me

1104
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:24,166
Mother, let me heal you

1105
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:31,882
Your pain has lasted far too long

1106
01:31:33,844 --> 01:31:39,890
Release it, it kills you

1107
01:31:41,727 --> 01:31:43,394
What was it?

1108
01:31:43,478 --> 01:31:44,980
Pollen.
Oh.

1109
01:31:45,064 --> 01:31:46,440
Thanks for the ride.
See you tomorrow.

1110
01:31:46,524 --> 01:31:47,524
Yeah.

1111
01:31:49,235 --> 01:31:55,490
The love you would not share
grows tired of waiting

1112
01:31:57,327 --> 01:31:58,577
Mr. Dollarhyde.

1113
01:31:59,245 --> 01:32:00,912
What are you doing here?

1114
01:32:08,212 --> 01:32:10,505
Strong as I am

1115
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:14,302
There's something about
this thing that scares me

1116
01:32:14,386 --> 01:32:16,554
Strong as I am

1117
01:32:18,932 --> 01:32:20,350
REBA: Who is it?

1118
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:21,643
DOLLARHYDE: lt's me.

1119
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,062
Who? Who is it?

1120
01:32:24,146 --> 01:32:25,146
DOLLARHYDE: It's me.

1121
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:26,230
Oh.

1122
01:32:27,441 --> 01:32:29,359
Francis?
No,

1123
01:32:30,819 --> 01:32:32,403
not Francis.

1124
01:32:34,198 --> 01:32:35,615
Francis is gone.

1125
01:32:37,242 --> 01:32:39,577
Francis is gone forever.

1126
01:32:49,089 --> 01:32:50,673
So, what are we doing?

1127
01:32:51,508 --> 01:32:52,758
The dream.

1128
01:32:54,427 --> 01:32:57,137
He dreams about being wanted and desired,

1129
01:32:57,597 --> 01:33:01,183
so he changes people into beings
who want and desire him.

1130
01:33:01,851 --> 01:33:02,893
Changes?

1131
01:33:02,977 --> 01:33:04,436
It's a word.

1132
01:33:04,938 --> 01:33:07,940
Killing and arranging the people
to imitate it.

1133
01:33:09,651 --> 01:33:11,902
And Lecktor told me something.

1134
01:33:11,986 --> 01:33:14,489
If one does what God does enough times,

1135
01:33:14,573 --> 01:33:16,616
one will become as God is.

1136
01:33:17,451 --> 01:33:19,244
You put it together, you get,

1137
01:33:19,328 --> 01:33:23,873
if our boy imitates being wanted
and desired enough times,

1138
01:33:23,958 --> 01:33:25,834
he believes
he will become one

1139
01:33:25,918 --> 01:33:28,294
who is wanted and desired and accepted.

1140
01:33:28,796 --> 01:33:30,630
It'll all come true.

1141
01:33:31,132 --> 01:33:34,050
This started from an abused kid,

1142
01:33:34,301 --> 01:33:36,010
a battered infant.

1143
01:33:37,513 --> 01:33:40,056
There's something terrible about...

1144
01:33:40,182 --> 01:33:42,810
JACK: What, are you sympathizing
with this guy now?

1145
01:33:44,813 --> 01:33:46,564
Absolutely.

1146
01:33:46,648 --> 01:33:48,357
My heart bleeds for him as a child.

1147
01:33:48,859 --> 01:33:51,485
Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster.

1148
01:33:51,653 --> 01:33:54,989
At the same time, as an adult,
he's irredeemable.

1149
01:33:55,699 --> 01:33:58,576
He butchers whole families
to pursue trivial fantasies.

1150
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:02,705
As an adult, someone should blow
this sick fuck out of his socks.

1151
01:34:07,335 --> 01:34:10,171
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?

1152
01:34:11,382 --> 01:34:14,885
Does this kind of understanding
make you uncomfortable?

1153
01:34:27,899 --> 01:34:29,691
What about the mirrors?

1154
01:34:32,069 --> 01:34:34,696
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.

1155
01:34:36,699 --> 01:34:38,950
But he doesn't take anything.

1156
01:34:39,995 --> 01:34:41,621
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.

1157
01:34:41,705 --> 01:34:44,749
He needs souvenirs or trophies
to re-live the event.

1158
01:34:49,129 --> 01:34:51,297
Maybe he records it somehow.

1159
01:34:52,549 --> 01:34:56,427
So he could see himself accepted
over and over and over again.

1160
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:02,475
VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?

1161
01:35:02,559 --> 01:35:04,018
How do I know?

1162
01:35:06,522 --> 01:35:08,314
How does he find them?

1163
01:35:09,859 --> 01:35:12,194
When we find out how he found them,
we'll find him.

1164
01:35:12,278 --> 01:35:14,738
There is no connection
between the two families.

1165
01:35:14,823 --> 01:35:16,490
We've done a dozen computer runs.

1166
01:35:16,574 --> 01:35:18,951
Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.

1167
01:35:19,035 --> 01:35:21,370
He didn't win them in a lottery,
he picked these women.

1168
01:35:21,454 --> 01:35:23,872
There's selection and design
in his choices.

1169
01:35:23,957 --> 01:35:26,625
Look, admit we struck out this month.

1170
01:35:26,709 --> 01:35:29,586
The Lear Jet is standing by,
the basic lab stuff is on it.

1171
01:35:29,671 --> 01:35:32,047
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price,
the photographer,

1172
01:35:32,131 --> 01:35:34,716
anywhere he hits, we can be there
in an hour and 15 minutes.

1173
01:35:34,801 --> 01:35:37,845
We get the call, we roll. The scene
will be fresher than we've ever had it.

1174
01:35:37,929 --> 01:35:39,389
It's not over yet.
For Christ's sake!

1175
01:35:39,473 --> 01:35:41,474
That's a foregone conclusion.

1176
01:35:41,559 --> 01:35:44,602
It's 11:30 p.m., the full moon
is happening tonight.

1177
01:35:44,937 --> 01:35:47,438
Give it up! Forget this month,
it's too damn late!

1178
01:35:47,523 --> 01:35:49,023
I gave it up.

1179
01:35:49,108 --> 01:35:51,192
Till you showed up with pictures
of two dead families,

1180
01:35:51,277 --> 01:35:54,737
knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine
families three, four, five and six. Right?

1181
01:35:54,822 --> 01:35:56,698
You're fucking right I did,
and I'd do it again!

1182
01:35:56,782 --> 01:35:58,867
Great! But don't talk
to me about late, pal,

1183
01:35:58,951 --> 01:36:00,869
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!

1184
01:36:00,953 --> 01:36:03,913
Until then, we go as late
as I want to take it!

1185
01:36:22,642 --> 01:36:24,101
A padlock.

1186
01:36:30,483 --> 01:36:32,401
That's why the bolt cutter.

1187
01:36:33,028 --> 01:36:34,361
What's that?

1188
01:36:34,487 --> 01:36:36,071
He used a bolt cutter
to trim away the branch

1189
01:36:36,156 --> 01:36:37,824
when he was watching from the woods.

1190
01:36:37,909 --> 01:36:40,076
Why didn't he use the bolt
cutter on the garage door?

1191
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:43,455
Because a deadbolt was there
when they were killed.

1192
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:50,337
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday
party was April 14th.

1193
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:53,924
Sometime between April 14th and August 1
they changed the lock.

1194
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:56,468
But he thought there was a
padlock there.

1195
01:37:04,143 --> 01:37:08,022
From the street, you can't see the glass
in the Leeds' kitchen door.

1196
01:37:08,106 --> 01:37:09,857
There's a big, high fence there.

1197
01:37:09,942 --> 01:37:12,526
But he was ready with his glass cutter.

1198
01:37:14,363 --> 01:37:17,365
So either he was casing far ahead

1199
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,369
and we didn't check back far enough,

1200
01:37:23,413 --> 01:37:24,664
or...

1201
01:37:27,209 --> 01:37:28,209
JACK: We checked.

1202
01:37:28,293 --> 01:37:29,293
Don't talk.

1203
01:37:32,923 --> 01:37:36,551
Metcalfe, is the Leeds and Jacobi
stuff still in the storeroom?

1204
01:37:37,553 --> 01:37:39,805
Have the guard down there call me.

1205
01:37:39,889 --> 01:37:41,014
Do it.

1206
01:37:49,273 --> 01:37:51,400
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.

1207
01:37:54,445 --> 01:37:58,532
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause
you thought there was a padlock.

1208
01:38:00,284 --> 01:38:01,827
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar,

1209
01:38:01,911 --> 01:38:05,248
but you know it's the Leeds' dog,
don't you, my man?

1210
01:38:07,668 --> 01:38:09,502
See the woman?

1211
01:38:09,962 --> 01:38:12,046
The bloom on the woman?

1212
01:38:13,924 --> 01:38:16,759
You can see her again and again
anytime you want.

1213
01:38:18,554 --> 01:38:19,512
Doggie doesn't have a collar,

1214
01:38:19,596 --> 01:38:22,015
but you know it's the Leeds' dog.

1215
01:38:22,808 --> 01:38:24,434
And the Jacobi cat.

1216
01:38:25,936 --> 01:38:27,770
And the padlock on the door.

1217
01:38:30,774 --> 01:38:34,778
And you know you need a bolt cutter
and every other goddamn thing

1218
01:38:35,655 --> 01:38:38,574
because everything with you is seeing,
isn't it?

1219
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:43,537
Your primary sensory intake

1220
01:38:43,955 --> 01:38:46,498
that makes your dream live is seeing.

1221
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:50,961
Reflections, mirrors,

1222
01:38:52,255 --> 01:38:54,423
images...

1223
01:39:03,184 --> 01:39:05,226
You've seen these films.

1224
01:39:10,357 --> 01:39:12,067
Haven't you, my man?

1225
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:20,992
It's the guard in the storeroom.

1226
01:39:21,077 --> 01:39:22,744
The cans.
What cans?

1227
01:39:22,828 --> 01:39:24,412
The tapes were transferred from
home movies.

1228
01:39:24,497 --> 01:39:26,081
Where's the packaging the films came in?

1229
01:39:26,165 --> 01:39:30,168
There's films of the families in
the document storage. Find them.

1230
01:39:32,589 --> 01:39:33,964
You got them?

1231
01:39:34,132 --> 01:39:35,966
Are there any labels?

1232
01:39:38,553 --> 01:39:41,430
Leeds can, Gateway Lab,
St. Louis, Missouri.

1233
01:39:41,515 --> 01:39:44,350
The Jacobi label will say the
same thing as the Leeds label.

1234
01:39:44,434 --> 01:39:46,519
Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.

1235
01:39:46,686 --> 01:39:48,562
JACK: Who processed the Jacobi film?

1236
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:54,610
No. Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.

1237
01:39:54,694 --> 01:39:56,362
Stores send them out.

1238
01:39:56,446 --> 01:39:58,322
Have him peel the top label back.

1239
01:39:58,406 --> 01:40:00,533
JACK: Is there a label underneath?

1240
01:40:13,005 --> 01:40:14,840
It does, doesn't it?

1241
01:40:22,056 --> 01:40:25,267
I want a chopper on the roof in
three minutes to Meigs Field.

1242
01:40:25,351 --> 01:40:26,393
At Meigs Field,

1243
01:40:26,477 --> 01:40:29,479
I want the Lear Jet prepped and
a plan filed with St. Louis.

1244
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:11,356
Where are you?
Are you here?

1245
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:19,198
You're scaring me with this!

1246
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:21,283
Will you just stop it?

1247
01:41:23,953 --> 01:41:25,621
Francis,

1248
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:28,415
why are you doing this to me?

1249
01:41:30,336 --> 01:41:31,794
It's ugly!

1250
01:41:32,379 --> 01:41:35,715
Don't you know that I'll always be true?

1251
01:41:36,467 --> 01:41:39,344
Are you in this room?
Where are you?

1252
01:41:41,013 --> 01:41:42,680
You answer me!

1253
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:46,643
And take my hand

1254
01:41:48,604 --> 01:41:52,106
Oh, won't you come with me

1255
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:58,196
And walk this land

1256
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:05,162
Please, take my hand

1257
01:42:13,338 --> 01:42:16,090
JACK: We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.

1258
01:42:16,174 --> 01:42:19,301
We don't have his name,
but we know he drives a van.

1259
01:42:19,386 --> 01:42:20,469
MAN OVER PHONE: Under
"Employee Facilities,"

1260
01:42:20,553 --> 01:42:22,429
I've got special stickers for vans.

1261
01:42:22,514 --> 01:42:25,266
Yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits
in the computer.

1262
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:26,976
JACK: Start feeding me names.

1263
01:42:28,354 --> 01:42:30,355
Is this Lieutenant Fisk?

1264
01:42:30,564 --> 01:42:31,856
Will Graham.

1265
01:42:32,024 --> 01:42:34,025
Listen, I need you to punch up
the driver's licenses

1266
01:42:34,110 --> 01:42:35,860
of the names
I'm gonna feed you.

1267
01:42:35,945 --> 01:42:38,613
The man we're looking
for is blond, Caucasian,

1268
01:42:38,698 --> 01:42:39,990
twenty to forty years old,

1269
01:42:40,074 --> 01:42:43,285
over six feet tall,
180 to 225 pounds.

1270
01:42:44,495 --> 01:42:45,829
First name? Alvaro.

1271
01:42:45,913 --> 01:42:49,165
A-L-V-A-R-O.
First name Joseph.

You guys better buckle up.

1281

This is our man.

Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?

1287
01:44:17,299 --> 01:44:18,716
From the airport you're a
few minutes closer.

1288
01:44:18,801 --> 01:44:22,053
We'll 10-25 at the Hark Road

JACK: Will?

1295
01:46:13,085 --> 01:46:14,836
You're not gonna need that.

1296
01:46:14,921 --> 01:46:17,672
A SWAT team is gonna
take him down, not us.

1297
01:46:21,803 --> 01:46:22,803
Will?

1298
01:46:26,808 --> 01:46:27,808
Will!

1299
01:46:45,452 --> 01:46:46,869
OFFICER 1 : This ought to be it
right here.

1300
01:46:46,954 --> 01:46:48,329
Kill your lights.

1301
01:47:05,807 --> 01:47:06,890
OFFICER 2: Are you all right?

1302
01:47:06,975 --> 01:47:10,018
OFFICER 3: I'm okay. Griffin's
hurt bad. I'll wait for the backup.

1303
01:47:12,772 --> 01:47:14,773
JACK: Set up a roadblock on Route 3.

1304
01:47:15,024 --> 01:47:17,818
Graham and I are in the trees
west of the house.

1305
01:47:18,987 --> 01:47:20,947
WILL: How far away is the
backup unit?

1306
01:47:21,031 --> 01:47:23,992
I'm going around the back.
Stay in the trees.

1307
01:48:03,825 --> 01:48:05,326
He's in there, Jack.

1308
01:48:07,412 --> 01:48:10,164
And he's got somebody in there with him.

1309
01:48:30,728 --> 01:48:31,978
JACK: What?

1310
01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:36,441
Will, what did you say?

1311
01:48:43,366 --> 01:48:45,992
JACK ON RADIO: Will.
Wait for the backup, Will.

1312
01:49:02,177 --> 01:49:05,262
He's got somebody in the house
with him, Jack.

1313
01:49:05,555 --> 01:49:06,555
JACK: Will.

1314
01:49:11,603 --> 01:49:12,645
Stop it.

1315
01:49:16,692 --> 01:49:18,110
Stop it!

1316
01:50:55,711 --> 01:50:56,836

In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby

1320
01:51:16,233 --> 01:51:20,361
Don't you know that I'll always
be true?

1321
01:51:24,825 --> 01:51:28,327
Oh, won't you come with me

1323

Oh, won't you come with me

1325

Please, take my hand

1326

It's okay.
