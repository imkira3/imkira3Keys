Put the fucking team back in!

14
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,888
Turn me around.

15
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,866
Shit!

16
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,457
Good run, Kable.

17
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,211
- My name is Tillman.
- Whatever your name is,

18
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:06,506
you got to the save point fast.
- Who the fuck cares?

19
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:07,883
No one is getting out of here alive.

20
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:09,926
I am. I'm gonna make it out.

21
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,595
Sure you will.

22
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:14,681
They said you got 3 battles left
before you get out.

23
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,296
Bob!

24
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,740
Bob!

25
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:29,488
Alright, let me handle this.
Bob!

26
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,823
- Do we have the interview or don't we?
- Yes

27
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,241
We are a cunt-hair close.

28
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:35,673
Look I'm not going to blow the
3 Asian Wars for 'close'.

29
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:39,073
With all do respect, Bob,
nobody cares about dead Orientals.

30
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,834
- They care about Ken Castle.
- Can I hear from Gina, please?

31
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,461
Okay, Bob ...

32
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:49,766
Bob, are you aware that Castle has clocked
exactly one media appearance date,

33
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:53,522
and that was Walter's last interview
before she died nine fucking years ago!

34
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:56,904
Stop menstruating and just tell me
whether we fucking have it?

35
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:59,194
We fucking, have it.

36
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,690
Good!

37
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:03,109
Palindromes.

38
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:06,274
Okay, focus.
Let's get lunch.

39
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:07,764
Iranian, Sushi, or Mexican?

40
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,833
Uh, no.
Burger, chilli, fries?

41
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,613
I could freak a burger.

42
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,617
We live in Society.

43
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:18,120
We visit Society.

44
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:20,872
I mean, which one ...

45
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,001
which one's more real?
Really?

46
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,962
I mean, which one's really real?
Know what I mean?

47
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:34,344
You're watching
Gina Parker Smith.

48
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:37,396
A live
'World Link Tonight' exclusive!

49
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:39,779
This motherfucker is
off the charts.

50
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:41,460
You realize he could
buy the network.

51
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:43,322
Yeah, why would he?
The son-of-a-bitch pulls in ...

52
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:45,923
650 millions pay-per-views
for one single broadcast.

53
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:51,399
Going live in ...
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...

54
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:55,075
First, there was "Society".

55
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,914
The ultimate SIM environment,
where players don't control ...

56
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:01,368
virtual animated characters,
but actual,

57
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,252
living, breathing, human beings.

58
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:08,341
They walked them. They talked them.
They juiced them. They rocked them.

59
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:09,842
Rickity-dickity-doo.

60
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:11,849
We had that on T-shirts
back in 2010.

61
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:14,839
The creation of reclusive genius
Ken Castle ...

62
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,225
"Who is Ken Castle?"

63
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:18,059
"Society" took the world by storm,

64
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:21,487
becoming the #1 guilty pleasure
of billions.

65
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:23,580
You can get paid to be controlled,

66
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:25,695
or you can pay to control.

67
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:29,294
And generating one of the
world's largest private fortunes,

68
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,140
surpassing Bill Gates
practically, over night.

69
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:39,285
Nine months ago,
Castle availed a new simulation.

70
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:44,165
One that would take gaming to
new heights of thrilling excess ...

71
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:47,210
and controversy.

72
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:48,548
SLAYERS

73
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:49,327
Slayers.

74
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:51,830
If "Society" let us
live through others,

75
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:55,283
"Slayers" would let us
die through others.

76
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:59,173
Slayers gives the gamer full control
of a flesh & blood human being,

77
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:01,735
in full scale kill or be killed combat.

78
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:03,907
And when we say "flesh and blood" ...

79
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:05,469
we mean, flesh ...

80
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,103
and blood.

81
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,123
Slayers.

82
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,820
Slayers!

83
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:21,394
Why isn't it murder?

84
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,709
Gina, when was the last time you saw
somebody volunteer to be murdered?

85
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:29,510
I'm sure you know that every last one
of our Slayers is a bonified death row inmate.

86
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,235
Each one offered the chance to participate
as an alternative to their sentence.

87
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:35,570
You stay alive for 30 sessions,
you get set free.

88
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,029
That's not a bad goddamn deal.

89
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:43,013
And has any of these men or women have
actually survived long enough to be set free?

90
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:46,778
Well I'd remind the audience that Slayers
was put together with a full cooperation ...

91
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:49,188
and approval, of the United States
Federal government.

92
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,815
That the revenue that produces ...

93
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:53,401
is responsible for funding
our entire prison system ...

94
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:55,695
keeping the bad guys
behind bars.

95
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:59,198
And that the Prop. (Proposition) was voted
for by a cock-solid 68% of the American public.

96
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,076
In an election tainted by
a suspected digital fraud.

97
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:04,704
Let's talk about the
so called "Genericons" ...

98
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,789
sent into the Slayers' environment,

99
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,877
With a set of pre-programmed actions,
with no one controlling them,

100
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:11,980
and no way to react.

101
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:13,845
Their chances of survival are next to nil.

102
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:16,562
There's plenty of men and women in prison
who can never cut it as Slayers.

103
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:20,887
Shouldn't they be given the same chance
to roll the dice for a ticket out?

104
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,264
Besides they only need to survive
one session.

105
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:25,558
Right.

106
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,685
So Mr. Castle,
how the hell does it work?

107
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:31,773
It begins with a single nano cell
planted in the motor cortex of the brain.

108
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:35,068
This cell can replicate,

109
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,362
replacing the cells around it
with perfect copies.

110
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:42,700
And these copied cells contain
remote access functionality.

111
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:45,662
Therefore nano plus cortex,
equals a "nanex".

112
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:48,581
Isn't it true, that every human
that undergoes this procedure,

113
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:51,709
will have a distinct "IP" address,
like a mobile device ...

114
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,711
or a notebook computer?
- Similar, yeah.

115
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:55,437
But control is strictly localized ...

116
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:57,288
to the parameters of
our gaming environment.

117
00:09:57,674 --> 00:09:59,676
You take "Society" for instance.

118
00:09:59,717 --> 00:10:02,845
Once a cast member has left the workplace
they're completely free ...

119
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:05,223
from the control and
monitoring of their player.

120
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:06,585
Oh well, that's a relief!

121
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,416
For some, maybe.

122
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:11,036
For some ...

123
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:20,446
Don't you suspect a good many folks
wouldn't mind or need a bit of controlling?

124
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,878
Someone else making
all the decisions for you?

125
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,363
No tough choices?
No responsibilities?

126
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,124
- Think about it.
- We will, Mr. Castle.

127
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:33,832
We will!

128
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:38,307
The Gina Parker Smith Show!
Sponsored by ...

129
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:39,713
SLAYERS

130
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:43,306
Good little talk?

131
00:10:43,673 --> 00:10:45,693
Oh, shit!
My pleasure!

132
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:49,351
Can I just tell you, I cannot wait
until the next Slayers,

133
00:10:49,463 --> 00:10:51,352
I mean, Kable has been unbelievable!

134
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:54,961
His arms are just so ...
well I know they're terrible!

135
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:00,439
What the hell was that?

136
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:05,909
Ken Castle wants you to believe that
we are living in a better, safer world.

137
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,913
- His a liar! Mind controlling his Slayers ...
- Mr. Castle, we have no idea where this is ...

138
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:14,792
We will all be his dogs if we allowed
this evolution to continue.

139
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:24,577
That's a goddamn hoot!

140
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,953
This is nuts, it's like the signal is generating
simultaneously from six countries.

141
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:31,134
Bypass overload. Reroute to
the backup servers please, now.

142
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:31,939
Now!

143
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:36,245
Uh, Mr. Castle, we can't stop every
virus that sneaks in.

144
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:37,923
You might want to let my home boys
take a look at your firewall.

145
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,807
We're on it. They'll be off
the air momentarily.

146
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:44,326
So sorry.

147
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:49,112
What about you, sugar?

148
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:51,261
I wonder if I might breach your
firewall one of these days?

149
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:53,170
You're bad!

150
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:55,700
He's good!

151
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,144
Hit him!

152
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:59,080
Fuck him up!

153
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:08,851
Get down!
Get the fuck down!

154
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:09,986
Get down! Get down!

155
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:07,775
Kable!

156
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:10,509
Kable!

157
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,154
My name is Tillman.

158
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:22,762
Yeah, yeah. Tillsman, Tillsman.

159
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:24,138
They said your name was Tillsman.

160
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,007
You're just sitting, eh?.

161
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:32,861
Sitting and looking, just looking
and sitting ... Just like me, man.

162
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:36,976
Keeping my wholes down,
you gotta keep your whole's down ...

163
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:40,688
Everyday I do it, and then
everybody snaps, breaks ...

164
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:42,982
starts to crack up, you know,
because you don't know if

165
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,568
you're going to live
a day or two or die.

166
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:48,435
Anybody but you, right?

167
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:51,515
27 battles, huh? Three to go ...

168
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:54,911
Nobody has ever done it.
No man has ever come that close.

169
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:57,839
No one has even got 10 games
without getting their brain shot ...

170
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,641
Everybody but Kable. Kable, because
he's sitting and looking, huh man?

171
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:05,018
You're gotta plan in your head.
You got a mission.

172
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,207
You never break.
You never snap.

173
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,748
You never say shit either, but you
take care of your business, don't you?

174
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,248
Niggers can get spooked by that kind of
single mindness, you know what I mean?

175
00:14:16,424 --> 00:14:17,333
Cause you're spooky.

176
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,810
You spook me.

177
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:21,602
Whatcha in for?

178
00:15:45,564 --> 00:15:46,815
You want to get back to them.

179
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:51,723
It's all you think about.
It's the only thing that keeps you alive.

180
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:53,442
Who's talking?

181
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:55,474
Sign it.

182
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:57,167
What?

183
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:01,284
 Sign it. Please Tillman.

184
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:04,462
 My son David is your biggest fan.
He prays for you.

185
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:17,487
 I need to prove it's authentic.
Makes it worth more.

186
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:19,873
Why would anyone want my name?

187
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:21,935
You don't even know what's
going on out there, do you?

188
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,731
All medical personal
report to central process.

189
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:25,705
Damn, gotta go.

190
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:26,706
No, no! Wait.

191
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:30,150
How did you get this picture?

Hey.

205
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,450
Hi.
- Hi.

206
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:09,235
So what's your damage?

207
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:17,489
You know, just hanging out.
Just looking to meet people.

208
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:19,198
... meet people.

209
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:24,431
Lucky you. You met me.

210
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,484
- I'm Nika.
- I'm Dale. I like your fur.

211
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:41,489
- Do you wanna go somewhere?
- Do you wanna go somewhere?

212
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:46,369
We are somewhere.

213
00:19:12,812 --> 00:19:18,151
Ken Castle ... is a liar.
Liar!

214
00:19:18,818 --> 00:19:20,570
Fuck!

215
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:23,156
A new video prank by
the subversive group "Humanz" ...

216
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:25,575
caused a nation wide
stir today.

217
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:29,412
All contact between "Society" city, and
an estimated 3 quarters of a million players

218
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:32,624
were shut down for 3 hours
while Castle technicians

219
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:37,045
worked to remove what they described
as a "satellite infection" ...

220
00:19:37,086 --> 00:19:40,382
These pranks, at first,
attributed to rogue isolated hackers

221
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:44,094
are now suspected to be the work of
an elaborate and sophisticated,

222
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:47,681
network of programming cells,
spread around several countries.

223
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:49,766
Experts estimate
that the service interruption

224
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:53,228
will end up costing Castle
billions in lost revenue.

225
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,480
Well don't cry for Castle,
he can cover this with

226
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:57,816
change in his couch cushions.

227
00:19:57,857 --> 00:20:00,235
On a personal note,
that shit was fucked up.

228
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:03,488
Yeah it was.
I literally pissed myself.

229
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,282
Sounds like fun.

230
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:09,119
Seriously, these Humanz cock suckers,
they're are out of control.

231
00:20:19,004 --> 00:20:22,382
- Sandra.
- Quiet.

232
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:28,847
- My name is Sandra.
- Stop talking.

233
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:15,174
They can't say I didn't try ...

234
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:25,836
Fuck yeah!

235
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:45,814
We're all going to die!

236
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:52,358
Oh God!

237
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:56,658
Let me out of here!

238
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:01,830
I'm not supposed to be here!

239
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:03,693
Who are they?

240
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:06,540
Who the fuck are they?

241
00:25:09,056 --> 00:25:11,236
Who the fuck is playing us, man?

242
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,854
Shut up, fish.

243
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:57,970
Gay, gay, gay, tardily gay.

244
00:25:58,011 --> 00:25:59,763
- Swarmers.
- Swarmers.

245
00:25:59,804 --> 00:26:01,765
The latest innovation
from Browning,

246
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:03,600
this self detonating cartridge ...

247
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:05,144
offers the widest
and deadliest spray available ...

248
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:06,937
from a full tracking,
cornering coordinates.

249
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:08,188
- Daddy like it.
- Simon!

250
00:26:08,229 --> 00:26:10,649
Fan girl, stop hacking me.

251
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,902
You suck Simon. You're going to get
my boyfriend killed ...

252
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:17,072
before he can get out of jail and before
he can fill me up with his hot seed!

253
00:26:17,113 --> 00:26:18,782
Simon!
I just wanna play you.

254
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:21,285
- Forget about that star fucker.
- Shut up bitch!

255
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,496
So when am I going to get to meet you,
for like, real?

256
00:26:24,537 --> 00:26:26,248
What's that?

257
00:26:26,957 --> 00:26:28,876
What's up looser?

258
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:31,295
Mum says: Go to college,
move the fuck out, and ...

259
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:33,881
And, oh yeah! You're a sick retard!
You're pathetic.

260
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:35,382
You smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.

261
00:26:35,423 --> 00:26:37,259
- Wanna make out?
- You wish.

262
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,595
I can't wait until they
cut you out, Simian.

263
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:40,596
Your balls bitch.

264
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:41,639
- Simon?
- Maybe.

265
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,307
Oh my God! Is really you!

266
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:47,353
- Nice.
- Do you want to see our tits, Simon?

267
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:48,145
Yes, yes I do.

268
00:26:48,186 --> 00:26:52,524
Now that we have your attention, here's
an offer that you can't refuse.

269
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:54,818
- Here we go.
- 50 million euros ...

270
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:56,320
for control of Kable.

271
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:59,531
instant transfer to the account
of your choice.

272
00:26:59,572 --> 00:27:01,408
Kable is not for sale,
thank you.

273
00:27:01,449 --> 00:27:03,961
Baby, make it a hundred ...

274
00:27:04,061 --> 00:27:04,912
It's been real!

275
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:13,754
What the fuck?

276
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:33,215
If you want to talk to Kable,
we can show you how.

277
00:27:36,986 --> 00:27:39,090
Look at it.
The new face of Slayers.

278
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,498
Pure, crystalized horror,

279
00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:44,100
two stories high and
bathed in bloody red.

280
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,108
He is what they want.

281
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:47,830
They love Kable.

282
00:27:47,871 --> 00:27:49,206
They do now,

283
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:52,418
but when they watch their hero die
right in front of their eye balls ...

284
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:53,919
so sharp and vivid ...

285
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,922
if feels like it could've reach out
and touch the wet flesh.

286
00:27:56,963 --> 00:28:01,207
They're going to change their point of
view and be seduced by the power ...

287
00:28:01,427 --> 00:28:05,041
.. the violence, the dominance.
It's human nature.

288
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:06,951
Kable's made it through 28 battles.

289
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:08,958
Every player in the game
is trying to take him out.

290
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,853
Yeah, Kable is a perfect soldier,

291
00:28:10,894 --> 00:28:13,188
He's a tactical killing computer.

292
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:17,985
His only vulnerability is
the nanex itself. The ...

293
00:28:18,027 --> 00:28:19,862
delay between Simon's commands

294
00:28:19,903 --> 00:28:23,032
and Kable's ability to execute.

295
00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:25,200
So why should this one
be any different?

296
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:27,912
Who controls him?

297
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:33,459
No one.

298
00:28:45,012 --> 00:28:47,222
Get it out of me!

299
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:09,161
What the hell happened
to this one?

300
00:29:09,202 --> 00:29:11,288
Looks like he escaped.

301
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:19,922
Hi girls. Back to your Jazz-ercise.

302
00:29:30,858 --> 00:29:33,018
That's Hackman,
Hackman, Hackman, knack man.

303
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,604
They say he killed a
whole bunch of people, man.

304
00:29:35,645 --> 00:29:37,690
Killed himself all kinds of people.

305
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:42,611
And then one day, he just walks up
and turns himself in ...

306
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:45,906
like he wants to be inside
or some crazy shit like that.

307
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:47,408
You know what I'm saying?

308
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:49,994
So it's going to be all
kinds of Slayers, man.

309
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:53,289
As long as you got motherfuckers like
that running around killing ...

310
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:57,501
Kable! Let's go!
Upgrades, come on.

311
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:01,180
Why don't you upgrade
a brother man?

312
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:04,550
Why don't you shut the fuck up?!

313
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:11,515
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

314
00:30:11,556 --> 00:30:14,101
Fucking, shut the fuck up.

315
00:30:41,295 --> 00:30:44,006
- Who wimps?
- What?

316
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:47,760
Who wimps,
The player or the slayer?

317
00:30:51,305 --> 00:30:52,025
I am the hand.

318
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:56,566
Someone, somewhere else is the eye.

319
00:30:57,144 --> 00:30:59,355
It's tripped out, man.

320
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:04,944
Sometimes, they take over ...
completely, they ...

321
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:07,738
move you around like a robot.

322
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:11,116
- But that don't work so good.
- Why?

323
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,661
The delay.

324
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:17,289
Yeah the ping.
They talk about that.

325
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,960
About how long it takes the
Slayer to respond to the command.

326
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:23,379
Whatever they call it,

327
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,676
the slice of a second out there, is the
difference between living and dying.

328
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:32,179
When that trigger pulls ...

329
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:39,311
.. it's just me.

330
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:00,776
Hey, Kable.

331
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:04,030
Look.

332
00:32:05,844 --> 00:32:06,909
I just killed someone.

333
00:32:09,823 --> 00:32:10,899
This is the blood.

334
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:14,267
Look.

335
00:32:18,823 --> 00:32:19,839
He's back here.

336
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,917
Wanna see?

337
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:26,266
You know your head ain't on straight.

338
00:32:32,048 --> 00:32:34,374
I'm going to kill you too,
on Sunday.

339
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,029
Yeah, probably.

340
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:37,535
That's why they put me here.

341
00:32:38,653 --> 00:32:39,733
I got no strings.

342
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:44,899
I got no strings,
so I have fun.

343
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,886
I'm not tied up to anyone.

344
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:54,102
They got strings,
but you can see,

345
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:59,733
there are no strings on me.

346
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,229
You go two whores, Kable.

347
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:06,439
- What the fuck did you say?
- On the outside.

348
00:33:07,775 --> 00:33:12,071
I'm sorry,
I meant your pretty girls.

349
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,867
So you want to get back to them.

350
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:19,286
But I'm going to visit them first.

351
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:31,470
Alright.

352
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:40,923
Kable.

353
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:46,096
Kable, dude. It's me.
It's me.

354
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:47,265
Who?

355
00:33:47,306 --> 00:33:50,436
Simon, I'm playing you.

356
00:33:50,477 --> 00:33:54,399
- How come I can hear you?
- Well, it's a mod.

357
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,861
Gamers can't talk to cons.

358
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:58,488
I know.

359
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,326
It's fucking unbelievable.
This is amazing.

360
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,600
Cool yeah?

361
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,394
No it's not cool.

362
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:26,024
Pay attention to the fucking game!

363
00:34:33,784 --> 00:34:36,704
Okay, okay.
I got it, I got it.

364
00:34:36,745 --> 00:34:38,040
What are you, 12?

365
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:41,044
I'm 17 actually,
thank you.

366
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,971
This is unbelievable.

367
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:51,381
How am I not dead yet?

368
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:54,854
Cause I'm a badass,
motherfucker.

369
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:10,096
Shit!

370
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:18,487
Freak, you shouldn't be here.

371
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,086
- Gibs.
- What?

372
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:47,007
Like giblets - Kibbles and Bits -
Chunks - Pieces everywhere.

373
00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:49,552
These are real humans fucker.

374
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:58,773
Death row, psychos ...  so what?

375
00:35:58,814 --> 00:36:01,401
They had it coming anyway, right?

376
00:36:14,794 --> 00:36:16,963
I guess that goes for me too.

377
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:19,049
Yeah, but you're different.

378
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:22,053
Different, how?

379
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:24,765
I don't know, because
you're my psych.

380
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:27,644
Damn new area.

381
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,489
Think about it Kable, all the shit
we've been through together,

382
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,201
what an epic run, man.

383
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:41,370
It's gonna suck to see it end.

384
00:36:41,411 --> 00:36:43,081
Are you fucking kidding me?

385
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:46,586
Oh yeah,
I get that for you it's different.

386
00:36:51,132 --> 00:36:51,592
This way.

387
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:57,255
- There's nothing there.
- Trust me, kid.

388
00:36:57,439 --> 00:37:00,392
It's restricted area. It's beyond
the borders of the game

389
00:37:00,432 --> 00:37:01,939
I couldn't put you there if I tried.

390
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,024
Warning.

391
00:37:03,065 --> 00:37:04,651
Access denied.

392
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:17,780
Shit.

393
00:37:29,926 --> 00:37:31,770
Bye, Kable.

394
00:37:47,124 --> 00:37:47,880
Come on.

395
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:50,661
This kid's going to get me killed.

396
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:53,590
Dude I'm right here, man.
I can hear you.

397
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:56,136
Listen to me.

398
00:37:56,177 --> 00:37:58,764
I don't know who's behind it or why,

399
00:37:58,805 --> 00:38:02,728
but I was supposed to die tonight.
Lucky for us,

400
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,440
I can beat them ...

401
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:07,484
but not with you controlling me.

402
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:09,153
What the hell are you talking about?

403
00:38:09,194 --> 00:38:13,826
Turn me lose, kid.
You want to win? Turn me lose.

404
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,705
Find a way.

405
00:38:16,955 --> 00:38:19,166
Bastard.

406
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:30,702
So Ms. Roth. Says here you're
applying for custody of your daughter?

407
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:33,704
Delia, her name is Delia.

408
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:36,439
Spouse incarcerated. Life,
without the possibility of parole.

409
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,777
- You use your maiden name?
- Uh-huh.

410
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:43,156
My husband ... he's ...

411
00:38:43,186 --> 00:38:46,410
it's not entirely true
regarding his sentence.

412
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,747
In fact,
he's due to be released soon.

413
00:38:48,788 --> 00:38:53,086
Ms. Roth,
your husband was charged and con ...

414
00:38:55,255 --> 00:38:57,634
He was charged and convicted
of first degree murder.

415
00:38:57,675 --> 00:39:00,346
I can't hardly consider his release,

416
00:39:00,387 --> 00:39:04,851
if it were to happen at all ...
I don't think it would be a good thing.

417
00:39:08,676 --> 00:39:09,616
So it's says you're an actor?

418
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:13,587
I don't know that I've
seen you in anything.

419
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:15,579
I work in "Society".

420
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:18,629
It's a job.

421
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:21,999
Ms. Roth, your child has been
exceedingly well placed.

422
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,919
The new family is very wealthy,
She will never want for anything.

423
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,965
Now I can understand that
you love your daughter.

424
00:39:28,006 --> 00:39:32,138
Probably very much. But do you really
think she would be better off ...

425
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:34,265
with ...

426
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:36,059
people like you?

427
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:41,984
Yes, I do.
I'm her mother.

428
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:48,909
We will give your application on
the consideration of merits.

429
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:20,191
Do you like the software?

430
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:21,746
Software?

431
00:40:22,163 --> 00:40:23,575
The walkie-talkie, player.

432
00:40:24,393 --> 00:40:24,791
No shit.

433
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:28,263
You're the guy from the TV,
the Humanz.

434
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:29,909
That's right, baby.

435
00:40:30,324 --> 00:40:32,145
You think about
what the brother said?

436
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:34,738
To what brother do you refer,
brother?

437
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:37,082
Kable wants the freedom to ass kick.

438
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:38,579
Do shit his way.

439
00:40:39,097 --> 00:40:41,046
- Are you going to give it to him?
- You were listening?

440
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,299
We see and hear everything ...

441
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:46,135
everything that goes on inside
that so called game.

442
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:49,622
Alright then,
Kable said we got lucky ...

443
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,851
They were gunning for us.
What's that all about?

444
00:40:52,363 --> 00:40:54,068
Kable got a past,
he knows things.

445
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:56,108
Things you don't even know.

446
00:40:57,262 --> 00:40:59,872
- What things?
- Things that Castle is afraid of.

447
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,667
As long as your boy stays on the inside,
Castle knows he can keep him quiet.

448
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,763
But if he ever got out ... Castle
would never let that happen.

449
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:09,621
There's one battle left,

450
00:41:09,812 --> 00:41:12,450
I think I can handle my own business,
thank you very much.

451
00:41:12,753 --> 00:41:13,281
You're not hearing me.

452
00:41:13,496 --> 00:41:15,290
This is not something you can control.

453
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,801
They're gonna kill his ass, Simon.

454
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:21,169
In the eyes of the world,
and then what?

455
00:41:21,864 --> 00:41:23,861
You're just another poor
little rich honky.

456
00:41:26,046 --> 00:41:28,249
No cable, no pussy, no shit.

457
00:41:29,317 --> 00:41:35,074
Look man, this ... this is too heavy.
I don't even know what the hell
are you talking about.

458
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:38,173
- I just play games, man. Games.
- That's right.

459
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:39,979
It is a game.
You want to win, don't you?

460
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,483
Yeah, I intend to.

461
00:41:41,518 --> 00:41:43,603
Then you need to cut your
strings puppet master.

462
00:41:43,644 --> 00:41:47,607
Imagine a slayer that don't got
to wait to be told what to do.

463
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:49,375
No ping, you dig?

464
00:41:51,005 --> 00:41:51,915
That would be cheating.

465
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:53,949
A mod.
That's all it would be.

466
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:57,663
You know why?
Because the game's got to evolve.

467
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,334
- You feel me?
- I do.

468
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:04,768
I do feel you my, giant brother.

469
00:42:05,204 --> 00:42:06,523
Well then, let's rock baby.

470
00:42:13,203 --> 00:42:18,083
Tillman ... he knows you talked to him.

471
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,002
 Your player.

472
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:26,263
Who are you?

473
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:27,317
 A friend.

474
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:30,457
I don't have any.

475
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,513
Listen to me.

476
00:42:32,554 --> 00:42:37,102
Simon is going to give you what
you want. What you asked him for.

477
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:41,198
How do you know that?

478
00:42:41,773 --> 00:42:42,572
 I know something else.

479
00:42:43,669 --> 00:42:45,281
Whether or not he's controlling you,

480
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,279
you will never reach the save point.

481
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,980
Castle won't allow it.

482
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,319
We'll see.

483
00:42:51,479 --> 00:42:52,822
 No, you have to escape.

484
00:42:52,857 --> 00:42:55,420
Your wife and your
daughter need you, Tillman.

485
00:42:57,371 --> 00:42:58,966
If you want to get out and see
the people in the picture ...

486
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,464
you will have to find another way.

487
00:43:06,738 --> 00:43:07,872
I need you to get me something.

488
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:12,011
What? Tell me.

489
00:43:13,262 --> 00:43:16,432
Drunk.

490
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,365
What have you got there?

491
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:03,575
Kable, what the hell is that?

492
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,547
Put it down.

493
00:44:14,714 --> 00:44:16,384
Put it down!

494
00:44:19,805 --> 00:44:23,976
Fuck face!
Throw the bottle in the trash!

495
00:44:43,374 --> 00:44:47,088
Oh, I see it was a great idea
turning you loose.

496
00:44:55,389 --> 00:44:57,474
- What happened?
- You happened!

497
00:44:57,516 --> 00:45:00,479
You wanted control,
you got it.

498
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:16,332
What's the matter with you, Kable?
Kill something!

499
00:45:40,736 --> 00:45:42,572
This is unbelievable.

500
00:45:42,613 --> 00:45:45,200
Kable, listen.
This is the last game ...

501
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:48,204
you're going to end up dead and I'm
going to look like a total asshole ...

502
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,207
if you don't pull
your balls together, man!

503
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,046
Damn it!

504
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:24,346
Kable, what the hell are you doing?

505
00:46:32,966 --> 00:46:35,469
Aw, what the hell?

506
00:46:37,723 --> 00:46:40,017
That's just gross, bro.

507
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,680
Go, go, go, go!

508
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:15,227
I'm not your fucking cheerleader!

509
00:47:29,494 --> 00:47:31,663
Motherfucker!

510
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,643
Kable, please, please,
I beg you, get back in the game.

511
00:47:49,684 --> 00:47:52,272
You're screwing my ass, Kable.

512
00:47:58,363 --> 00:48:01,700
This is a restricted area.
Return to the battle zone.

513
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:03,325
RESTRICTED

514
00:48:10,735 --> 00:48:11,336
I'm dead.

What the fuck just happened?

524
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:47,579
Initial reports are that Kable,

525
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,541
the most recognizable face
of the Slayers phenomenon ...

526
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:53,085
next to Ken Castle himself,

527
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:55,465
is officially listed as fragged.

528
00:49:55,506 --> 00:49:58,843
Just one session away from being
the first Slayer ever ...

529
00:49:58,884 --> 00:50:01,722
to win a full pardon and release.

530
00:50:01,763 --> 00:50:05,601
And in NetCast, fledged by technical
difficulties and dead spots,

531
00:50:05,642 --> 00:50:07,855
the report could not be confirmed,

532
00:50:07,896 --> 00:50:11,817
however Kable, born
John Tillman of Albany, New York ...

533
00:50:11,858 --> 00:50:14,446
and convicted of murder
just 4 years ago,

534
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:18,616
has been removed from Slayers
rosters and upcoming events listings.

535
00:50:18,657 --> 00:50:21,454
His player, gaming mega star,
Simon Silverton,

536
00:50:21,495 --> 00:50:23,248
could not be reached for comment.

537
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:26,294
Do you have a question?

538
00:50:26,504 --> 00:50:28,379
Tillman left a wife
on the outside, right?

539
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,883
- Tillman, yeah.
- Find her.

540
00:51:01,293 --> 00:51:03,965
Blink, activated.

541
00:51:38,172 --> 00:51:39,882
She's not home.

542
00:51:39,923 --> 00:51:43,846
But Castle's personal security will be,
soon enough and trust me ...

543
00:51:43,887 --> 00:51:47,142
- You don't want to meet them.
- Who are you?

544
00:51:47,183 --> 00:51:49,478
You asked me that once before.

545
00:51:50,479 --> 00:51:52,856
- Your voice.
- You know, you should really come with me.

546
00:51:53,941 --> 00:51:55,569
Like now!

547
00:52:51,512 --> 00:52:53,848
See that's why you're a fool!
That's what I'm talking about!

548
00:52:55,434 --> 00:52:59,229
Could you stop it with that
freaking awful bullshit?

549
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:01,649
Come one man, that's why
it's a game of deception, man!

550
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,867
That's bullshit, man!
You know that's bullshit!

551
00:53:09,908 --> 00:53:11,870
So you're the ones who broke me out?

552
00:53:11,911 --> 00:53:14,665
- We only freed your mind.
- And your ass followed.

553
00:53:14,706 --> 00:53:16,584
Holly shit ...
You made it!

554
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:23,634
You're really here.
Kable. You're great.

555
00:53:25,552 --> 00:53:29,391
- You got questions.
- A few.

556
00:53:29,432 --> 00:53:31,560
So she took my blood.
Why?

557
00:53:31,601 --> 00:53:33,563
The nanex.

558
00:53:33,604 --> 00:53:36,566
It modifies the actual cell
structure of your brain.

559
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:40,529
We can crack it, but it's not one size
fits all. We need your DNA ...

560
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:43,158
so that we can generate custom code.

561
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:44,702
Alright, then why me?

562
00:53:44,743 --> 00:53:46,454
Because Castle is afraid of you man.

563
00:53:46,495 --> 00:53:49,624
It ain't just a game, Tillman. Every
day there's more people stepping forward.

564
00:53:49,665 --> 00:53:53,337
Want to be a part of Castle's world, throwing
away everything that means to be human.

565
00:53:53,378 --> 00:53:55,172
Right now is the desperate ones.

566
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:59,553
Convicts, addicts, the sick, the poor.
The ones that fell through the cracks.

567
00:53:59,594 --> 00:54:01,514
The federal prison system
is growing out of control.

568
00:54:01,555 --> 00:54:03,599
Set to bankrupt the whole damn USA,

569
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,018
then Castle rides in on a white horse.

570
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:09,106
Says he has a plan to bail us all out
and we just fall in line?

571
00:54:09,147 --> 00:54:10,734
The healthcare system is collapsing.

572
00:54:10,775 --> 00:54:13,403
And this time he's pushing for
total control over genetic diseases.

573
00:54:13,444 --> 00:54:15,489
Birth defect is no longer an issue.

574
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:17,866
All we have to do is exchange our cells
for the ones he wants to give us.

575
00:54:17,907 --> 00:54:19,869
Promise of a longer life
and a fatter wallet ...

576
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,871
- Do you think people will refuse?
- Fuck no.

577
00:54:21,912 --> 00:54:23,499
Then the next thing you know ...

578
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:27,586
we're all slaves.

579
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:31,133
I can't help you.

580
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:35,839
Tillman.
We know where she is.

581
00:55:40,925 --> 00:55:42,512
Hi, Nika.

582
00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:46,391
- Oh hi. Rick Rape, right?
- Rick Rape, right?

583
00:55:47,851 --> 00:55:50,814
I thought you weren't allowed
to come here anymore.

584
00:55:56,361 --> 00:55:58,698
That was last month.
I was a bad boy.

585
00:56:01,368 --> 00:56:06,457
Are you still a bad boy?

586
00:57:04,612 --> 00:57:07,573
- Please, don't kill me.
- Please, don't kill me.

587
00:57:07,614 --> 00:57:09,368
No.

588
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:13,413
- I'll do anything.
- Don't say that.

589
00:57:17,585 --> 00:57:18,963
Stop!

590
00:57:19,004 --> 00:57:22,050
Stop!
Goddamn it.

591
00:57:22,717 --> 00:57:26,470
You, in there controlling ...
Let her talk!

592
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:29,432
I can't she has to say what I tell her.

593
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:32,186
You can hear me.
I know you can.

594
00:57:34,857 --> 00:57:36,191
I love you.

595
00:57:36,232 --> 00:57:37,819
I love you too.

596
00:57:38,694 --> 00:57:40,531
Shut up!

597
00:57:41,614 --> 00:57:44,618
Don't say anything else.
I'm going to find you ...

598
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:47,706
and I'm going to rip you to fucking
pieces, do you understand me?

599
00:57:47,747 --> 00:57:49,750
I'm getting you out of here.

600
00:57:53,754 --> 00:57:56,674
I'm going to take you to some place
where you can turn it off, the program.

601
00:57:57,801 --> 00:57:59,762
Hi Kable.

602
00:58:13,945 --> 00:58:16,782
Look at me bitch!

603
00:58:18,785 --> 00:58:20,746
Anybody in there?

604
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:40,853
Go on.

605
00:58:40,894 --> 00:58:42,481
Do it.

606
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:46,309
What the fuck do we do?

607
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:52,252
I can get you out of here.

608
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:05,644
Oh shit!
I can't believe it's you!

609
01:02:05,685 --> 01:02:11,317
This is ... listen, Tillman,
you can trust me, I swear.

610
01:02:12,446 --> 01:02:16,366
If not ...
you're dead!

611
01:02:16,407 --> 01:02:18,076
Okay.
Faster! Faster!

612
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:37,100
I guess you remember that day, huh?

613
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:41,105
You just gotten Kable through his
10th consecutive session alive.

614
01:02:42,064 --> 01:02:44,776
No one ever thought an icon
could last that long.

615
01:02:44,817 --> 01:02:46,987
Pretty hot shit, aren't you?
Kid player.

616
01:02:47,028 --> 01:02:48,904
Good times.

617
01:02:48,945 --> 01:02:52,367
Sure, on the outside.
Now look at these.

618
01:02:54,662 --> 01:02:56,583
That's what it's like on the inside.

619
01:02:56,624 --> 01:02:59,877
Wonder how long you would last
on the other side of the screen?

620
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:03,256
You know, Simon ...
you being held here today ...

621
01:03:04,507 --> 01:03:07,470
suspected of aiding an escape
of a convicted murder ...

622
01:03:07,511 --> 01:03:09,806
from a maximum security penitentiary.

623
01:03:09,847 --> 01:03:12,476
The charges are beyond serious.

624
01:03:14,729 --> 01:03:16,939
Your hard drives have been seized.

625
01:03:17,815 --> 01:03:21,154
Forensics are depicting the content
as we speak.

626
01:03:21,195 --> 01:03:23,780
Your internet activity over
the last 10 years,

627
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:26,451
is being scrutinized and cataloged.

628
01:03:26,492 --> 01:03:28,162
In minute ...

629
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,623
vivid detail.

630
01:03:30,664 --> 01:03:33,669
In addition, your father's bank
accounts have been frozen,

631
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,587
pending further investigation.

632
01:03:36,547 --> 01:03:40,469
After all, it was essentially his money
that funded Mr. Tillman's escape.

633
01:03:41,511 --> 01:03:43,096
Now I need you to tell me ...

634
01:03:43,137 --> 01:03:46,519
everything that happened leading
up to yesterday afternoon.

635
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:51,190
Anybody you talked to, everything
you saw, everything you did.

636
01:03:52,276 --> 01:03:55,530
And I need you to tell me that
right now.

637
01:03:55,571 --> 01:03:57,157
Yeah, huh ...

638
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,703
I'm going to need something too.

639
01:04:03,081 --> 01:04:07,002
Oh really?
And what might that be?

640
01:04:07,795 --> 01:04:11,133
Could you guys do a sandwich like ...

641
01:04:11,174 --> 01:04:14,470
peanut butter,
or almond butter, walnut butter ...

642
01:04:14,511 --> 01:04:17,516
huh, pecan butter, pistachio butter ...

643
01:04:19,184 --> 01:04:23,063
pretty much any kind of ...
you know, nut butter

644
01:04:23,104 --> 01:04:24,691
with some grape jelly.

645
01:04:27,695 --> 01:04:29,655
Pistachio butter.

646
01:04:29,696 --> 01:04:32,741
- They make that?
- It's awesome.

647
01:04:47,844 --> 01:04:49,387
Now what?

648
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:53,185
Now we just put the DNA into the suit,
light it up, extract it ...

649
01:04:53,226 --> 01:04:55,896
a few modifying sequences
into the code and ...

650
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:57,272
we're good to go.

651
01:04:57,313 --> 01:04:59,525
- It's an anti-spyware program.
- Basically.

652
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:02,069
We can't quarantine the foreign
cells per say, but ...

653
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:04,864
we can disable their ability
to transmit and receive.

654
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:07,410
Fuck that.
I'll make you cut it out me.

655
01:05:07,451 --> 01:05:09,537
That would be like cutting out
a part of your brain.

656
01:05:09,578 --> 01:05:12,374
The nanex cells replace the cells,
they replicate.

657
01:05:12,415 --> 01:05:14,001
They become you.

658
01:05:15,668 --> 01:05:18,381
We're going to have to keep her
sedated until we kill the link.

659
01:05:18,422 --> 01:05:21,385
Otherwise she will be broadcasting
everything she sees and hears,

660
01:05:21,426 --> 01:05:23,304
30 minutes.
You give us a robot ...

661
01:05:23,345 --> 01:05:26,767
we give you back a super hot female.

662
01:05:26,808 --> 01:05:28,434
Tillman!

663
01:05:28,475 --> 01:05:30,063
We need to talk.

664
01:05:31,939 --> 01:05:34,109
- So talk.
- Come on.

665
01:05:43,245 --> 01:05:45,956
They tested it on soldiers.

666
01:05:45,997 --> 01:05:48,585
The first volunteer was
a Corporal Travis Scotch.

667
01:05:48,626 --> 01:05:51,004
A friend of yours, I believe.

668
01:05:51,045 --> 01:05:53,298
And the second was you.

669
01:05:57,754 --> 01:06:00,433
The idea was to replace your brain,

670
01:06:01,235 --> 01:06:03,477
bit by bit, cell by cell.

671
01:06:03,518 --> 01:06:07,065
The new tissue would never
break down, never deteriorate.

672
01:06:08,443 --> 01:06:12,070
A new era in human longevity,
that's what they told us.

673
01:06:12,111 --> 01:06:14,200
9 weeks later Scotch was dead ...

674
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:16,369
and you were serving life in maximum.

675
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:18,078
Castle's project was shut down.

676
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:20,749
But the same technology
resurfaced within a year ...

677
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,041
in a game.

678
01:06:22,082 --> 01:06:24,377
Castle called it "Society".

679
01:06:24,418 --> 01:06:28,425
Tillman, listen man, whatever
happened in that project, is
something Castle wanted buried.

680
01:06:28,466 --> 01:06:31,846
We need that shit man.
What you saw, what you know.

681
01:06:34,098 --> 01:06:35,641
I don't know what to tell you.

682
01:06:35,682 --> 01:06:37,643
You gotta tell me shit.

683
01:06:37,684 --> 01:06:39,313
I want you to show me.

684
01:06:42,692 --> 01:06:44,862
Okay, we're ready to rock.
Let's break the link in ...

685
01:06:44,903 --> 01:06:47,656
3 ... 2 ... 1.

686
01:06:57,711 --> 01:06:59,295
Who's there?

687
01:07:05,094 --> 01:07:07,013
What are you doing here?

688
01:07:08,473 --> 01:07:11,310
- Who are you?
- Tech support.

689
01:07:23,242 --> 01:07:25,452
- What are we looking at?
- His memories.

690
01:07:25,493 --> 01:07:28,249
Translated into raw audio-visual data.

691
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:31,418
I read something about this.

692
01:07:31,459 --> 01:07:34,506
But that tech is not supposed to be
available for another decade.

693
01:07:34,547 --> 01:07:37,592
They'll have better shit than
this in Best Buy in 18 months.

694
01:07:46,102 --> 01:07:48,732
Oh, son of a bitch!
John Tillman.

695
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:52,317
Man I never thought I would be so
happy to see your ugly face.

696
01:07:53,404 --> 01:07:56,699
Scotch.

697
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:01,705
Is it me or is this place fucked?

698
01:08:02,415 --> 01:08:04,917
They got me hooked up to
computers 5 hours a day.

699
01:08:06,086 --> 01:08:09,048
Feed me vitamins, and pills,
and god knows what ...

700
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:11,508
giving me injections,
taking and giving me blood ...

701
01:08:11,549 --> 01:08:15,889
These nurses are whipping my ass ...
and they're male nurses too, bro!

702
01:08:17,141 --> 01:08:19,143
I can't believe I let you
talk me in to this.

703
01:08:19,184 --> 01:08:23,565
And I'm having these, like, blackouts ...
and it's scaring the shit out of me.

704
01:08:23,606 --> 01:08:25,400
I don't even know
how long I've been here ...

705
01:08:28,363 --> 01:08:30,616
Hey man ...

706
01:08:32,659 --> 01:08:34,912
Are they letting you out already,
you son of a bitch?

707
01:08:37,207 --> 01:08:39,125
I'm not getting out.

708
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:40,794
Okay.

709
01:08:45,257 --> 01:08:47,552
Johnny ...
Are you good?

710
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:50,598
I'm fine.

711
01:08:50,639 --> 01:08:52,391
Man you don't look fine.

712
01:08:54,978 --> 01:08:56,314
I'm sorry.

713
01:08:56,355 --> 01:08:57,940
Yeah that's okay.

714
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:01,653
It's not like you ever looked that
good in the first place.

715
01:09:09,204 --> 01:09:10,789
What's the gun for, John?

716
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:12,416
What's happening?

717
01:09:13,668 --> 01:09:16,129
Really you're scaring me man.
What's the gun for?

718
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:17,589
I can't st ...

719
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:19,466
I can't stop.

720
01:09:19,507 --> 01:09:21,970
Stop what?
What did they do to you man?

721
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:26,976
John, stop it! You're scaring me now.
Stop it.

722
01:09:27,017 --> 01:09:28,602
Sorry Scotch, I ...

723
01:09:29,937 --> 01:09:31,565
John, no! Don't!
Stop!

724
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:46,416
Not the best commercial for Ken Castle.

725
01:09:46,457 --> 01:09:47,833
He made him do it.

726
01:09:47,874 --> 01:09:49,795
- Castle made him do it.
- It was a test.

727
01:09:49,836 --> 01:09:50,963
Cha-ching.

728
01:09:51,004 --> 01:09:52,883
Excuse me, media whore.

729
01:09:52,924 --> 01:09:54,759
This isn't just a story.

730
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,845
The whole world
is splitting down the middle.

731
01:09:56,886 --> 01:09:59,264
Sooner or later, everyone
is going to have to take a side,

732
01:09:59,305 --> 01:10:00,891
even scavengers like you!

733
01:10:40,982 --> 01:10:42,735
It's you.

734
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:52,538
I missed you, so much!

735
01:10:52,579 --> 01:10:54,833
You are the reason I held on.

736
01:10:59,606 --> 01:11:02,550
- I love you.
- Where's our daughter?

737
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,435
I couldn't stop them. I'm sorry.

738
01:11:10,476 --> 01:11:12,688
Nobody could.

739
01:11:12,729 --> 01:11:16,317
The foster parents paid good money
to remain anonymous.

740
01:11:16,358 --> 01:11:18,944
But there's always a data trail
if you know where to look.

741
01:11:18,985 --> 01:11:20,322
Where is she?

742
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:21,864
I'm sorry, Tillman.

743
01:11:21,905 --> 01:11:23,827
She's with Castle.

744
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:41,807
Tillman!

745
01:11:43,683 --> 01:11:46,061
That's all the story
you're going to get.

746
01:11:59,327 --> 01:12:00,955
Silverton, get up.

747
01:12:03,249 --> 01:12:05,460
What's going on man?

748
01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:08,798
Looks like someone up the chain
has decided you're no longer a threat.

749
01:12:17,724 --> 01:12:19,687
CHEATER

750
01:12:19,728 --> 01:12:22,189
FUCK YOU CHEATER!

751
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:32,785
NANEX
ACCESS DENIED

752
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:39,293
We'll find him.

753
01:12:40,419 --> 01:12:42,045
Don't worry.

754
01:12:42,714 --> 01:12:44,425
He'll come to us.

755
01:13:59,933 --> 01:14:02,686
- Not bad for a video, huh?
- What?

756
01:14:02,727 --> 01:14:06,275
The latest and greatest, I defy you
to tell it from real life ...

757
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:08,109
could you imagine porn on this thing?

Castle.

780
01:16:39,085 --> 01:16:40,669
Kable.

781
01:16:41,963 --> 01:16:43,464
I don't care about you.

782
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:45,844
You just want your little
sugar pie, I know.

783
01:16:45,885 --> 01:16:47,511
So don't do anything stupid.

784
01:16:48,305 --> 01:16:49,889
My house, my rules.

785
01:16:50,723 --> 01:16:52,601
Come on,
I want to show you something.

786
01:16:59,151 --> 01:17:01,737
I wanted to thank you for
leading me to them,

787
01:17:01,778 --> 01:17:04,282
the Humanz's cell, that is.

788
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,458
Of course sooner or later
they'd be whistling my tune ...

789
01:17:07,478 --> 01:17:08,992
just like everybody else, but ...

790
01:17:09,616 --> 01:17:13,794
in the meantime, there's that little cracker
program they dreamed up that got my attention.

791
01:17:13,835 --> 01:17:15,921
That was a genuine nuisance.
No doubt about it.

792
01:17:15,962 --> 01:17:18,216
One thing even they didn't know, though:

793
01:17:18,257 --> 01:17:19,340
I'm wired too.

794
01:17:20,043 --> 01:17:23,168
I replaced 98% of my own noodle
with nano-tissue years ago.

795
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:29,021
But mine's different.
It's built to send,

796
01:17:31,398 --> 01:17:32,483
to transmit,

797
01:17:32,524 --> 01:17:34,200
whereas every other nano-cell
that I've put out there,

798
01:17:34,542 --> 01:17:37,907
including the ones
in your head Kable,

799
01:17:37,948 --> 01:17:39,071
are designed to receive.

800
01:17:39,725 --> 01:17:42,324
I think it, you do it.

801
01:17:50,672 --> 01:17:53,594
We're talking every Slayer,
everyone in Society city.

802
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:56,137
I believe your better half would
fall under that category,

803
01:17:56,178 --> 01:17:58,806
provided they were within
range of my transmitters.

804
01:17:58,847 --> 01:18:02,311
Very nice, Castle. So you got
an army of psychotics ...

805
01:18:02,352 --> 01:18:04,731
and deviants to dance around for you?

806
01:18:04,772 --> 01:18:10,197
You're thinking small, Kable.
But not as small as me.

807
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:12,492
See, nano-cells are real small.

808
01:18:12,533 --> 01:18:16,078
A thousand times smaller than
these dust particulars.

809
01:18:17,038 --> 01:18:19,584
You inhale it. They go to work;
replicating, spreading ...

810
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:22,629
like a virus, multiplying
in exponentials.

811
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:26,091
Six months time, I can have a
hundred million people converted.

812
01:18:26,132 --> 01:18:28,761
Ditch diggers, porn stars,
and Presidents.

813
01:18:28,802 --> 01:18:30,179
Not one would be the wiser.

814
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:33,225
A hundred million people who buy
what I want them to buy,

815
01:18:33,266 --> 01:18:35,394
and vote how I want them to vote,

816
01:18:35,434 --> 01:18:39,148
do pretty much damn well anything
I figure they ought to do.

817
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:41,484
For instance ...

818
01:19:17,862 --> 01:19:20,282
You should have let him
fight for himself.

819
01:19:21,492 --> 01:19:23,201
Maybe you would've had a shot.

820
01:19:23,242 --> 01:19:26,415
- I think you're missing the point, my man.
- No, no, I get it.

821
01:19:26,456 --> 01:19:27,917
You're pulling all the strings
around here.

822
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:30,587
Which makes my next move pretty ...

823
01:19:32,755 --> 01:19:34,550
Neglected to mention
my smart boys reversed ...

824
01:19:34,591 --> 01:19:36,886
that crack the Humanz worked for you.

825
01:19:36,927 --> 01:19:39,764
Easy-breezy once
I had access to their drives.

826
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:53,364
You're mine boy.

827
01:20:10,885 --> 01:20:13,005
Come on, let's boogie-woogie
rock & roll.

828
01:20:20,271 --> 01:20:23,275
I think that badass Slayer of the game
don't seem like much, does he?

829
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,954
Lucky shot.

830
01:20:35,332 --> 01:20:36,959
Not really.

831
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:51,559
I need an audience boys ...

832
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:14,881
No, no, no, you crawl ...
on your belly like a toad.

833
01:21:14,922 --> 01:21:17,176
Is this bad?
I'm really bad.

834
01:21:17,801 --> 01:21:19,844
Is this bad?
I'm really bad.

835
01:21:26,853 --> 01:21:28,480
That's sweet.

836
01:21:31,275 --> 01:21:34,945
Alright boys are you ready?
It's time for a true test.

837
01:21:35,747 --> 01:21:38,825
Just like last time, remember?

838
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,262
Yeah, you're stronger now,
a little more fight in you ...

839
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:47,727
but I think the end result
will be just about the same.

840
01:22:07,237 --> 01:22:08,695
What the hell was that?

841
01:22:08,736 --> 01:22:11,240
Someone from the outside
is sending him commands ...

842
01:22:11,281 --> 01:22:13,327
We're being broadcast live.

843
01:22:14,285 --> 01:22:16,914
Jam the signal!

844
01:22:17,956 --> 01:22:19,459
Goddamn retards!

845
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,086
We're working on it ...

846
01:22:22,797 --> 01:22:24,423
I think it,

847
01:22:24,965 --> 01:22:27,468
You ... fucking ... do it ...

848
01:22:36,396 --> 01:22:38,482
Look at this knife ...

849
01:22:38,523 --> 01:22:40,567
imagine me sticking it into your gut.

850
01:22:42,153 --> 01:22:45,657
Think about it ...
make it real!

851
01:23:18,929 --> 01:23:19,531
Yes!

852
01:23:20,141 --> 01:23:20,809
Yes!

853
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:44,437
- Are you okay?
- Are you my daddy, Tillman?

854
01:23:47,066 --> 01:23:48,691
I'm your daddy.

855
01:23:53,783 --> 01:23:55,409
Wait.

856
01:23:56,953 --> 01:23:59,080
- Shut it off.
- Pardon?

857
01:23:59,949 --> 01:24:01,165
The nanex.

858
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:04,832
It means nothing to you.
It's just a mouse click.

859
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,465
Set us free.

860
01:24:13,514 --> 01:24:15,224
Well played, Kable.
