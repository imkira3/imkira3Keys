2
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,282
You must draw your strength
from your surroundings.

3
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:18,369
It can provide your escape,
or be your trap.

4
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,521
Father, are you okay?

5
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,819
Good.

6
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,751
I will not always be able
to protect you, my son.

7
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,379
You earn your place in this world.

8
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,089
Is that why we do this?

9
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,767
One day, I'll be strong enough
to go to Emunah.

10
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:33,194
When my father was your age,
Emunah descended into our world.

11
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:37,907
Everything was engulfed
in its brilliant light.

12
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:43,079
They believed it would
seal us forever in eternal peace.

13
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:48,626
But when the eclipse ended,
it was only darkness.

14
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,420
We do this because
we live in darkness...

15
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,922
and we must fight to stay alive.

16
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,884
We must never stop fighting.

17
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:04,183
Forget Emunah, my son,
Dominion is all we have.

18
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,299
I won't let them take you.

19
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,720
Father.

20
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:40,863
This sword once belonged
to the great King Araiah.

21
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,742
May it spare your soul from evil.

22
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,011
No!

23
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,384
Where's the chief?

24
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,639
Dead.

25
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:40,399
His daughter... that's their princess.

26
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,463
She's my last sacrifice to the Emperor.

27
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:36,455
That sword... it's sacred.

28
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,879
It's been protected for generations.

29
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,393
We believe it came from
the very source of life.

30
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,395
It is too late for you, friend.

31
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,653
Give her to me.

32
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,490
And I will do you the honor...

33
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:55,576
of carrying your corpse home on my back.

34
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,246
I'll bury you next to your father.

35
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,249
If I don't?

36
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,294
Then I will leave you where
you stand and you will rot.

37
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,308
Reiken!

38
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,841
The world of war has given birth...

39
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,843
to a great warrior.

40
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,806
His enemies shall fall by
a sword not of man.

41
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,269
Who are you?

42
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,564
I am the King Araiah.

43
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,319
You shouldn't have come here.

44
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,706
My name is Aysel.

45
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,256
I believe you are here for a reason.

46
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,692
Stay.

47
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,196
Zera didn't mean to harm you.

48
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,367
She only wanted to know your soul.

49
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,246
Who's Zera?

50
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,126
She's our princess.

51
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,170
Princess?

52
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,273
You're safe with us.

53
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,860
We do not kill.

54
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,446
This is Emunah.

55
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,662
Your kind is not welcome here.

56
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,303
- He is the prophecy!
- I didn't address you.

57
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,667
King Araiah spoke of this day.

58
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,462
The day that our kingdom
would finally be restored.

59
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,800
The day that a hero of war
would be sent to us...

60
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,844
from the depths of darkness.

61
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,891
I have been waiting a lifetime for it.

62
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,733
You should leave this place
now and never return.

63
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,454
Aysel?

64
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,299
Show me how to fight them!

65
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,801
I am them!

66
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:56,014
Not anymore.
Their power is a lie, mine is truth.

67
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,826
There is an animal within us all.

68
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,955
The mask blinds it, takes us
to a place where the soul...

69
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:24,084
our true essence, may be revealed.

70
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,549
What we can see with our eyes
is nothing more than an illusion.

71
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,145
This is yours.

72
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,765
If you believe the lie
that you're cold...

73
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,893
it will be a long night for you.

74
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,840
There's a cult wandering our lands...

75
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,676
disciples of King Araiah.

76
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:59,054
The Emperor has deemed them
as a threat to the Dominion.

77
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,640
He's called all Jaguar Knights
to protect the princess.

78
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,269
Why the princess?

79
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,322
You first.

80
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,838
Come closer.

81
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,144
Now kill me.

82
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,062
What?

83
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,983
Kill me!

84
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,487
Come on, get up!

85
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,662
Kill me... or I will kill you.

86
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:17,466
You think you will defeat The Dominion?

87
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,885
They will devour you.

88
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,766
Accept your Kingdom is gone forever.

89
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,323
Draw your strength...

90
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,991
from your surroundings.

91
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,994
It will provide your escape,
or become the trap.

92
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,705
Make it your weapon
before your enemy does.

93
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,084
When they attack, be waiting for them.

94
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,628
Swallow their power.

95
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,300
Turn it against them.

96
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,057
Kill them through their weakness.

97
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,603
You must be strong.

98
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,454
Move faster.

99
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,562
Come on, Aysel!

100
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,361
Aysel?

101
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,785
Aysel?

102
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,045
They've come to enjoy
the taste of blood...

103
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,381
even if it's their own.

104
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,731
Aysel has always dreamed
of conquering man...

105
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,774
and restoring the Kingdom.

106
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,777
It's why he believes you're here.

107
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,198
Why do you believe you're here?

108
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,202
To protect your people.

109
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,038
The Dominion will never find us.

110
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,917
I did.

111
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,714
All you've ever known is war.

112
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,844
One self pitted against
the self of another.

113
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:18,141
It is the world of man...
And to you it's real.

114
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,355
It will be real for your people too,
soon enough.

115
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,441
Aysel knows there'll be
no war unless I declare it.

116
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,445
And he's wrong about you.

117
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:34,658
You've been chosen for something
much greater than war.

118
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,702
You have the power to open
the eyes of all nations...

119
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:43,667
so that they can finally see
that our Kingdom never fell.

120
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,340
Is that why you saved me?

121
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,593
Saved you?

122
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:58,431
I was dying by the water, you healed me.

123
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,479
Whoever saved you, it wasn't me.

124
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,264
Time of war is upon us.

125
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,811
You've trained us well.

126
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,771
You have my gratitude.

127
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,775
It's time for you to go.

128
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:26,162
If I go...
I'm taking your princess with me.

129
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,084
She was never our princess.

130
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,306
Why the princess?

131
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:49,936
King Araiah believed that
he had received a prophecy...

132
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,021
A prophecy instructing him
to immerse himself

133
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,023
in the living waters
at the time of the eclipse.

134
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:59,654
Doing so, he would be anointed
to unite all men...

135
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,365
in peace for eternity.

136
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,577
King Araiah had journeyed with
his men to the living waters...

137
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,579
at the time of the eclipse.

138
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:13,293
As he entered the waters,
he was mortally wounded...

139
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:17,922
by a disciple most dear to him,
his brother.

140
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,674
When the eclipse ended...

141
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,469
Araiah lay dead at
the bottom of the waters.

142
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,721
His brother, who led the rebellion...

143
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,559
ushered in a new era
of ruthless warfare.

144
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,688
That disciple was our Emperor.

145
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,402
If it's true the princess
is the only descendent...

146
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,323
of Araiah's bloodline,
then if Emunah returns...

147
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,201
we must bring her to the living
waters before the eclipse.

148
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,509
What are they?

149
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,845
This is the world of man.

150
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,473
The world that gave birth to you and me.

151
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,727
And this is the world of souls...

152
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,480
where our tribe has always dwelled.

153
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,188
Remember who we do this for.

154
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,402
Our time has come.

155
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,294
I know why you're here.

156
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,924
I have a better offer.

157
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:22,690
You were right, Aysel,
it is clear to me now...

158
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,361
that this warrior was chosen.

159
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,197
I relinquish my full command to you.

160
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,782
You would hand over
the fate of your people...

161
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,618
to a warrior of the Dominion?

162
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,081
You will never be one of us, Zera!

163
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:42,001
I am the one with the courage
to fight for our people.

164
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,170
I'm the rightful heir to
the throne of our fathers.

165
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,589
And yet, they chose me.

166
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,638
There will be no more
waiting for our kingdom...

167
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,516
to be handed back to us from the sky.

168
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,852
Tomorrow, I will leave this place!

169
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,650
And I will declare war on
the Dominion and all nations!

170
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,653
A kingdom built upon evil...

171
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,739
will never be the kingdom
of your fathers.

172
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,368
Nor will the kingdom
that is buried by it.

173
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,298
Aysel...

174
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,261
you don't have to go.

175
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,402
Dad!

176
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,908
I found this place when I was a child.

177
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,163
Suddenly, I found myself at
the bottom of this very lagoon.

178
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,040
And when I came to the surface...

179
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,920
Aysel and the others
were waiting for me.

180
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:11,174
He told me that King Araiah
had chosen me...

181
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,634
to return the heavens to earth.

182
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:21,058
When I was a little boy,
the Emperor's daughter was taken.

183
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,563
He vowed to destroy every nation
until she was returned.

184
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,276
He then killed his own Jaguar Knights...

185
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,278
for failing to protect her.

186
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:39,202
My father, he was a Jaguar Knight.

187
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:46,334
Those who bring home
the seed of a nation...

188
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,461
they are given freedom.

189
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,798
The seed of a nation?

190
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,760
A princess.

191
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:03,935
When I was young, I fought
to redeem my father's name.

192
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:12,985
With time, I fought for
what every soul wants...

193
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,821
freedom.

194
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,658
What does your soul want now?

195
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:25,832
To forget... everything.

196
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,214
If your heart could forget
the darkness...

197
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,133
then you wouldn't be able to protect us.

198
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:40,054
Without it, you wouldn't have found me.

199
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,408
We should have been home days ago.

200
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,036
The stars are moving.

201
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,497
We're wandering in circles.

202
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,104
Tell them I'm sorry.

203
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:23,824
No! No! No!

204
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,293
This place has never known death.

205
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,404
Aysel was right.

206
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,910
Time of war is upon us.

207
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,686
Go, go, go.

208
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,988
I want to fight in your army.

209
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,240
You are young, Nikai.

210
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,658
So was I.

211
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,253
You miss your father?

212
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,092
You'll see him again.

213
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,512
He'll be waiting for you...

214
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,183
in the reflection of
your enemy's dead eyes.

215
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:04,443
Take a defensive position.

216
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,783
Again.

217
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,994
Concentrate.

218
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,088
One more time, come on!

219
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,381
Concentrate.

220
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,886
If the enemy senses your presence...

221
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,682
before you are in striking
distance, it's too late.

222
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:39,895
He will outrun you, or kill you first.

223
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,734
- Were you hurt?
- No.

224
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,742
We should go.

225
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,890
He was right. This is pointless.

226
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,952
Nikai!

227
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,174
What are you doing here?

228
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,467
You shouldn't have followed me.

229
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,345
What are you doing here?

230
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,312
I've come to fight alongside
the true prince.

231
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,200
Go.

232
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,246
You disobeyed my command!

233
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,216
Let's go.

234
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,806
We were attacked by
a Dominion war squad.

235
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:36,316
They killed his father and
captured the three of us...

236
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,735
alive to be sacrificed to the Emperor.

237
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,780
An enemy tribe ambushed
them on the way back.

238
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,159
We freed ourselves...

239
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,038
and we killed them all.

240
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:57,671
My dream of rebuilding our
kingdom is finally coming true.

241
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,633
And I won't stop killing until it does.

242
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:11,310
You once told me that
your power is truth.

243
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,647
And nothing has changed.

244
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:19,026
Everything has changed.

245
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,695
This land, all of it,
is rightfully ours.

246
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,785
It will be the land of our children.

247
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:34,416
I will take it with my own
hands, my own blood.

248
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:40,672
Get up, Nikai, we're leaving.

249
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,265
Perhaps the time has come
for us to return home.

250
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,935
I can defend my people
from the Dominion.

251
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,480
I can protect our princess.

252
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,316
You said she was never your princess.

253
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,656
I will make her my princess.

254
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:13,247
It is no longer your home.
They are no longer your people.

255
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:18,001
And she, will never be your princess.

256
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:26,843
As I said, nothing has changed.

257
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,955
He is leading a conquest.

258
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,418
Swallowing entire tribes
against all odds.

259
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,884
"His enemy shall fall
by a sword not of men."

260
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:12,764
These are the words your soul
uttered while you were masked.

261
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,688
It means Aysel is destined...

262
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,648
to be Prince of this world.

263
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,990
No!

264
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:48,985
Why are you still here?

265
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,113
I buried my father here.

266
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,750
I'm not leaving him.

267
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:44,541
The world of war has
given birth to a great warrior.

268
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:49,504
He will be grateful for
the afflictions he has endured...

269
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:53,175
for the evil he has known.

270
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,214
Attack!

271
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,640
No! No!

272
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,058
Agh!

273
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:05,473
Zera? Zera!

274
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,273
Oh, no.

275
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,251
Oh, God.

276
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,499
You will be a great warrior, my son.

277
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,585
Though you were born into
a world of darkness...

278
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,338
you will die in a world of light.

279
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,050
For it will be you who marches
the Sword of Orion...

280
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,970
into the heart of the Dominion.

281
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,639
Ready yourself.

282
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,304
You will be a great warrior, my son.

283
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,390
Ready yourself.

284
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:20,103
I will return for you,
in this world or the next.

285
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:29,529
Father... I'm scared.

286
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,240
Fear is a lie.

287
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:53,803
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you at your post?

288
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,892
I'm going back.

289
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:03,354
You're rebuilding our nation, Nikai.

290
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,732
You killed my father.

291
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:09,569
He left me no choice.

292
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,034
He tried to stop you...

293
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,703
because he saw what
I could not see until now.

294
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,583
That you are evil and so is your nation.

295
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,418
Nikai...

296
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,838
I'm going back.

297
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,675
To what?

298
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:38,681
To the home I never
should have abandoned.

299
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,308
It's too late, Nikai!

300
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,397
They're all gone.

301
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,070
It was only a matter of time
before the Dominion found them.

302
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,343
Please...

303
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,390
my little brother...

304
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,562
Just tell me that he was spared!

305
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,569
Please!

306
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,833
Agh!

307
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:12,668
23 years.

308
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:16,005
Battling our way through
the world of death...

309
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:19,467
only to end your journey in disgrace.

310
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,096
Just like your father.

311
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:30,978
You waited all your life
to feel the Emperor's hand...

312
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,273
over your head and grant freedom.

313
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:40,029
But we both know, freedom
is not what you're looking for.

314
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,077
We are warriors.

315
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:50,790
Dominion is freedom, this is freedom!

316
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,584
This is not freedom.

317
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,878
There is the fire.

318
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,632
I first saw it when they drained
your father's neck...

319
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:03,636
in front of you and I saw it
every day with every king...

320
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:08,099
you dragged along the land
to meet his fate.

321
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:11,978
And how does a boy get close
enough to the Emperor...

322
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:13,980
to avenge his father?

323
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,731
A princess sacrifice.

324
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:20,486
Do you really think I would let
you get close to the Emperor?

325
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:26,534
She said you would come for her,
but what I don't understand...

326
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,162
why wasn't it you who brought her here.

327
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:33,124
She showed me something greater.

328
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,834
Well, I'm sorry, my friend...

329
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:38,129
the Emperor took her soul last night.

330
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:46,095
Run, Warrior, while you have the chance.

331
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:50,391
Go in peace.

332
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:56,189
Running won't give me peace.

333
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,399
Then what will?

334
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,535
Vengeance.

335
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,358
Get up.

336
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:06,444
I'll see you in hell, brother.

337
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:11,699
This is hell, brother.

338
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:34,091
A war slave of the Emperor...

339
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:39,305
frees the Dominion to pursue freedom.

340
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:44,769
You will suffer a public execution...

341
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:49,356
a fight to the death and
the fear in your eyes...

342
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,651
when you breathe your last breath...

343
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:56,572
will be your repentance.

344
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,494
Fear is a lie.

345
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:07,666
Your kingdom is a lie.

346
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:56,215
Agh!

347
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:07,883
Father! Father! Father!

348
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:14,389
Zera?

349
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:17,476
Spare him.

350
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:21,855
Spare him and I will return to you.

351
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:25,400
No, Zera, don't do it.

352
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:30,489
Don't do it.

353
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,659
With all of my heart and
all of my soul...

354
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,120
I will reign over this land
as your princess.

355
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:39,206
Zera, don't... don't do it.

356
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,549
Very well.

357
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:55,430
I will spare him.

358
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:05,149
Take him away.

359
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:14,676
They took you from me, my only seed.

360
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:22,017
I never stopped looking for you,
year after year...

361
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,978
nation after nation...

362
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,523
princess after princess...

363
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:32,653
I never stopped.

364
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:40,494
Father, it was I who chose to leave...

365
01:15:40,535 --> 01:15:43,789
and it was I who chose to return.

366
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:51,004
I realized that there was
nothing to fear...

367
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:56,009
because even darkness is light.

368
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:02,140
Father, I didn't return
to join your world.

369
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:04,268
I returned to destroy it.

370
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:19,283
The sword is sacred, given
from the very source of life.

371
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:23,161
Come closer.

372
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:06,330
I brought the kingdom of
our fathers to this world, Zera.

373
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:11,209
Instead of being annihilated
by the Dominion...

374
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:14,463
I harnessed their strength.

375
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:17,966
I did what I had to do.

376
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:23,722
This was the prophecy, Zera.

377
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:28,810
We're meant to rule
the kingdom together.

378
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:39,780
And tonight, I am your prince.

379
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:44,868
You are prince of this world, Aysel...

380
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:48,038
but you will never be my prince.

381
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:17,317
The world of war has given
birth to a great warrior...

382
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:21,363
his enemies shall fall
by a sword not of man.

383
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:42,235
Aysel.
