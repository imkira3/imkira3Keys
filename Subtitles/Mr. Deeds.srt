1
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,735
Hello, folks at home.

2
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,489
I'm 100 yards from the top of Mt. Everest.

3
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,118
Yet there's a part of me
that can't wait to end this silly vacation...

4
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,621
...and get back to work,
where the real challenges await.

5
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,333
Shouldn't you take your age
into consideration, sir?

6
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,460
After all, you're 82 years old.

7
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,171
Am I 82?

8
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,216
These numbers mean nothing to me.
My journey through life has just begun.

9
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,843
Sir! Sir!

10
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:36,096
- Oota tells me the storm's getting worse.
- Very, very bad.

11
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,433
We must abandon our ascent and
go down the mountain immediately.

12
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,519
We're so very close to the top,
Mr. Puffy Jacket Man.

13
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,523
I'm heading down now, sir.
I advise you to do the same.

14
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,941
All right, so be it.

15
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,945
See you at the staff meeting on Monday.
And I'll bring the Krispy Kremes!

16
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,926
There, once again, the sad footage
we've been watching all day.

17
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:19,014
A beloved visionary who turned a single
radio station into a global media empire...

18
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,559
...Preston Blake, dead at 82. More after this.

19
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,191
You're watching the Blake Broadcasting Network.

20
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,985
The stock of Blake Media,
the parent company of this network...

21
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,655
...plunged this morning
on the news of Blake's death...

22
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:38,867
...but bounced back after a statement
by Blake's longtime number 2, Chuck Cedar.

23
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,203
All the king's horses and all the king's men...

24
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,748
...couldn't save Preston Blake
from becoming a human Popsicle.

25
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,670
And sources indicate that Blake, who was
single and had no children, left no will.

26
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,841
So who inherits Blake's 49 percent stake
in the company's stock...

27
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,093
...valued at $40 billion?

28
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:00,722
We'll discuss that with people close
to Blake, including his longtime barber...

29
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,726
...on tomorrow's 'Inside Access'.
Until then, I'm Mac McGrath.

30
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,689
- Are we clear?
- Clear!

31
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,316
Babe? Where's Babe?

32
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,902
- I'll come over and choke you to death.
- Babe!

33
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,279
I got to go.

34
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,865
Freaking barber!
That's the best you could get me?

35
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,617
People tell everything to their barbers.

36
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:24,162
He's been his closest confidant
for more than 20 years.

37
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm not putting this guy on the air.
Get me something better and get it quick.

38
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,710
Or it's your ass.

39
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,883
Did we find this heir yet?

40
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,969
We should be getting that information
via fax any minute now.

41
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,430
I have lawyers looking through birth records...

42
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,308
...in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and Guam.

43
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:48,896
In fact, we have a little pool going.
Guam's paying off at 1000-1.

44
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,064
Is this a joke to you?

45
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,652
Some genetic lottery winner
now controls the fate of this company.

46
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,322
No, I agree. It's troubling.

47
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,033
Troubling? Your beard is troubling.

48
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,704
Your pipe is troubling.
Your yellow teeth are really troubling.

49
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,625
But if I lose control of this company,
it'll be catastrophic.

50
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,050
Does anyone know a Dr. Mendlesohn?

51
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,303
Congratulations, you have a spastic colon.

52
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,806
That would explain a lot.

53
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,365
"Longfellow Deeds."

54
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,374
Chuck, I think we're there.

55
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,002
My God, it's all green.

56
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,512
Look at that thing. Fighter pilot on your left.

57
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,515
Got that sucker!

58
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:22,781
You guys lost?

59
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,659
We're looking for somebody: Longfellow Deeds.

60
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,245
Is that Deeds' first name?

61
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,998
If the Deeds you're referring to
is Longfellow Deeds...

62
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,333
...then yes, that is Deeds' first name.

63
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,420
I don't know Deeds' first name. Maybe it's Greg.

64
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,006
- Maybe it's Longfellow.
- Maybe.

65
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,676
But I don't know. I know another guy
named Greg. You want me to call him?

66
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,846
No! Thank you.
Please, just tell us where Deeds lives.

67
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,933
All right, don't get all hyperactive.
I'll take you straight to him.

68
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,900
Step right in, fellows.

69
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,114
- He lives at a pizzeria?
- You can't live in a pizzeria.

70
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,366
He lives upstairs. He owns it.

71
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,744
Excuse me. Is Mr. Deeds around?

72
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:13,248
No, I'm sorry, he's out making deliveries.
The regular delivery guy called in sick.

73
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:18,504
- But you don't look too sick, Murph.
- I forgot I was faking sick today.

74
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:24,134
- You two tricked me into coming here.
- Murph, put on an apron and give me a hand.

75
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,679
You guys played me like a fiddle. "Touché"!

76
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,641
Is Mrs. Deeds around?

77
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,644
Mrs. Deeds?
I don't think that poor boy ever had a date.

78
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,898
- Do you know when he'll be back?
- Before lunch is out. Today's Card Day.

79
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,234
- Card Day?
- Deeds writes greeting cards.

80
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,445
Every Monday, he tries out a few
and then he chooses one...

81
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,073
...and sends it to one of the big card companies.

82
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,492
Now, he hasn't sold any yet, but...

83
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,952
...he will.

84
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,955
You guys need anything else here?

85
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,873
"To my sweetheart

86
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,585
"I love you completely, with all my soul

87
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,797
"Without you I'm nothing, a butterless roll"

88
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,550
That's good.

89
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,884
Like that, gentlemen?

90
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,055
Hallmark said it showed potential,
which is pretty cool.

91
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,432
- Longfellow Deeds?
- Just call me Deeds, pal.

92
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,309
Easy with that Longfellow stuff.

93
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,311
Chuck Cedar, CEO.

94
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,064
Cecil Anderson, General Counsel of Blake Media.

95
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,150
Handshakes are for strangers.
We hug around here, buddy.

96
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,444
What's up? Welcome to town.

97
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,531
Come on, don't be shy.

98
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,743
I like that beard. Abe Lincoln-style.
Have a seat, boys.

99
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,078
- Murph!
- Deeds?

100
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,206
- I thought you were sick today.
- That was a lie, pal.

101
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,708
You fooled me.

102
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,917
- I did?
- Yeah.

103
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,919
- Mr. Deeds?
- Just Deeds.

104
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,965
You sounded so sick on the phone.
You're good. Do that sick voice again.

105
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:49,178
Deeds, I can't come to work today.
I think I got strep throat.

106
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,851
That's unbelievable.
You could be a radio actor or something.

107
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,395
- Thanks, buddy.
- Sure.

108
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:01,523
Hey, Deeds. Read a card already.
I got to get back on duty.

109
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,694
I'd better get up there.
Good meeting you, gentlemen.

110
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,655
Mr. Deeds, does the name Preston Blake
mean anything to you?

111
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,866
Mom's maiden name was Blake.

112
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,162
Only one this week, but I got a feeling
it'll end my losing streak with Hallmark.

113
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,917
Preston Blake was your mother's uncle.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,003
You're kidding me, I got an uncle?
Awesome. How's he doing?

115
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,296
He's dead.

116
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,299
Oh, no. If there's anything I can do...

117
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,092
Deeds! Deeds!

118
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,136
I'll be right with you guys.

119
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,265
When Mr. Blake died,
he left an enormous fortune.

120
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,227
$40 billion. He left it all...

121
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,270
...to you, Deeds.

122
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,149
Wait a minute.

123
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,946
What are you talking about, you got
to get back on duty? You're not a cop.

124
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,657
You're right.
I got this down at the costume shop.

125
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,492
But it can't hurt to pretend.

126
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,328
What a wisenheimer!

127
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,413
Okay, everybody, it's showtime.

128
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,417
I call this "50th Anniversary Card."

129
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,753
Which is quite a feat nowadays.

130
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:09,341
"Fifty years have passed by
with laughter and tears

131
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,261
"Do you remember when we went to the zoo

132
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,721
"and that time we drank all the beers"

133
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,473
Beers!

134
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,520
"I promise to love you for 50 years more

135
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,357
"Even when your bosoms sag down to the floor"

136
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,653
That was awesome! How's he do it?

137
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,993
It looks like you won't have
to deliver pizza anymore, Deeds.

138
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,120
You're a very rich man.

139
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,789
What's that got to do with delivering pizzas?

140
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,500
Ladies! The top one is yours.

141
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,627
- Thank you, Deeds.
- Of course.

142
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,671
- Yummy!
- So, Deeds, what's new?

143
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,924
I found out I have an uncle, but he died.

144
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,467
That's too bad.

145
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:56,263
- He gave me $40 billion, though.
- Well, that's nice.

146
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,347
Oh, yeah!

147
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,601
Don't you go and spend it all
on some fancy record player.

148
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,144
I won't.

149
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,812
Who are your friends, Deeds?

150
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:08,317
I'm sorry.
Chuck, Cecil, this is Jane, Kitty and Sue.

151
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:12,696
- Pleasure to meet you, Cecil.
- Pleasure's all mine, Kitty.

152
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,657
Or should I just say, "Meow"?

153
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,828
Keep it in your pants, Anderson.

154
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:25,584
- Now, why am I inheriting this money?
- You're Mr. Blake's closest living relative.

155
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,504
- Really? He had nobody else?
- Nope, that's it.

156
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,714
Gosh, I never even met the guy.

157
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,719
Would you hold this for a second?

158
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,223
Mr. Wetherley. How you doing, pal?

159
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,518
Very well, Deeds. Just going to the pharmacy.

160
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,895
Well, let me get you there a little quicker.

161
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,275
- How's your wife?
- She's fine.

162
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,819
- Terrific. Say hi for me.
- I will.

163
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,238
Okay. Here you go.

164
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,325
- Thanks for the lift, Deeds.
- You got it.

165
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:05,082
We need you to come back to New York with us.
Just for a few days.

166
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,626
We're drawing up some papers
you'll need to sign.

167
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,919
What kind of papers?

168
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:13,799
Technically, you've inherited
300 million shares of Blake Media, Inc.

169
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,302
Chuck and l, along with
some of the partners, will buy that stock...

170
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,639
...for $40 billion,
which we've had to borrow from various...

171
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,891
Who cares about the financial mumbo jumbo?

172
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,727
We need a little time
to dot the t's and cross the i's.

173
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:29,231
And while we're doing that,
we need you to stay away from the press.

174
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,568
The media frenzy will die down
in a couple weeks but until then...

175
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,405
You don't want reporters crawling
all over this lovely little town, do you?

176
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:37,865
Oh, no!

177
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,161
- Crazy Eyes!
- What?

178
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:49,251
How you doing, pal?
I got your pizza, just the way you like it.

179
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:50,752
Oh, yes!

180
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:55,007
French fries and Oreos.
You know me all too well, Deeds.

181
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,633
What are you in for?

182
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,178
I'm doing a one-nighter
for biting Ed the mailman.

183
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,931
The guy was trying to cast a spell on me,
like a wizard.

184
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,895
- Are you sure about that?
- I don't know. Maybe he was just waving.

185
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,983
- Who are your friends?
- This is Chuck and Cecil from New York.

186
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,694
I don't like them.

187
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,030
Okay. Nice seeing you.

188
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,993
I've never been to New York before.
I suppose I could check out the sights.

189
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,454
- Give me an hour to pack, okay?
- You got it.

190
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:29,458
I'll be the first guy to leave here since
Jimmy McNally went to Disney World.

191
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,462
See you later, everybody!

192
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,511
Tomorrow is "Kids Eat For Free" Day.
Don't forget to clean the highchairs.

193
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,013
Don't worry, I'll take care of everything.

194
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,265
- Go, have a good time!
- I'll miss you.

195
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,434
'Bye, Jan. Smell you later, Murph.

196
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,687
- Give us a card!
- Yeah!

197
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,319
"On my way to the big city for a business trip

198
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:02,032
"Never, ever left Mandrake Falls before
Ain't that a pip

199
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,539
"But while I'm gone, I know I'll miss you all a lot"

200
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,918
"So bring your rich butt back here
and buy us all a shot"

201
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,296
You got it, pal!

202
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,219
Take it easy.

203
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,773
The biggest story of the year
and we've got nothing?

204
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,902
Do you people want to be tabloid journalists?
Because I don't think so.

205
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,155
You've got to be ruthless. When I started out...

206
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:45,117
...I slept in Tom and Roseanne's dumpster
for two days...

207
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,036
...disguised as a giant carton of ice cream.
- I got it!

208
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,206
My source at Blake says
the company helicopter...

209
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,751
...took off from there this afternoon
with two male passengers aboard...

210
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,795
...headed for Mandrake Falls.
- Where?

211
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,173
Some little hick-ass town in New Hampshire.

212
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:03,010
But now they're on their way back
with three male passengers.

213
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,721
- That's one more!
- Duh!

214
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,683
That third guy's our heir. Nice work, Marty.

215
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,186
They were supposed to arrive
at Blake Media at 5:00.

216
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,479
But they made an unscheduled stop
in Connecticut.

217
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,274
I'm so happy I got the Big Bacon Classic.

218
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,818
Thanks for stopping. This is unbelievable.

219
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:23,030
- Happy to do it.
- How's that Frosty treating you, Cecil?

220
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:26,867
You got some on your beard. I'm just kidding.

221
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,660
I got him big time, man.

222
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,830
I'm going on the air in two hours' time.

223
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,918
And I want that guy's life story by then.
I'm talking to you, Jim.

224
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,795
And I'm also talking to you, Babe. Babe?

225
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,215
Where the hell's Babe?

226
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,343
You missed another staff meeting. Mac's pissed.

227
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,804
He won't be pissed when I crack this Blake story.

228
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:51,099
- What do you got?
- Nothing. Do you have anything?

229
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,393
I'll have a lot more in a few hours.

230
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,937
You got to be a pal.

231
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,607
I need this story.
I'm flat broke and Mac is going to fire me.

232
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,610
How're you flat broke?
You make more money than anyone here.

233
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,529
- What did you blow it on?
- Shoes.

234
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,532
I'll tell you everything I know
over lunch tomorrow...

235
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,617
...as long as your club promoter boyfriend...

236
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,453
...doesn't try to run me over
with his motorcycle again.

237
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:15,374
You're safe there.
Ken and I are kind of taking a break.

238
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,084
Really? So he moved out?

239
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:21,713
Babe, what are you staying here for?
I have a spare bedroom.

240
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,966
We tried that once, remember?

241
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:28,178
I woke up and you were standing
over my bed, breathing heavily.

242
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,348
I was having an asthma attack.
I couldn't find my puffer.

243
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:38,772
Easy, fellows.
The Biggie Fries are making a comeback.

244
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:43,527
You guys football fans? The Pats
could take the conference this year.

245
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,655
The Dolphins are overrated
and the Jets are choke artists.

246
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,407
I wouldn't say that, Mr. Deeds.

247
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,827
- Just Deeds. Why is that, though?
- You own the Jets, Deeds.

248
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,245
I do?

249
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,665
That sucks.

250
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:02,004
I hope they don't play the Pats in the playoffs
or I'll have to kill myself.

251
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,175
I'm still very worried about this.

252
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,512
What do you got in that pipe, hashish?
You're paranoid.

253
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,974
- This guy's perfect for us.
- What if he won't sell us his shares?

254
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,393
If I got Blake to trust me with his company...

255
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,104
...I can get this moron to do the same.
Look at him.

256
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,507
That's right, Anderson.

257
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,439
Enough!

258
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,067
Party pooper.

259
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,114
Holy cow!

260
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,200
What's up, New York?

261
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:17,830
It's an honor to come
to the greatest city in the world

262
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:30,175
Congratulations, Deeds, you're now
the most eligible bachelor in New York.

263
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,262
I don't want to meet a girl
just because I'm wicked rich.

264
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,973
That's nice, but let's see
how you stick to your guns...

265
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,393
...once you've paid a visit to one
of our many fine gentlemen's clubs.

266
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,227
What?

267
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,896
My father saved my mother.

268
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,524
She was figure skating and fell through the ice.

269
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:49,319
I always thought I'd meet
a girl the same way. Bullspit like that.

270
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:53,240
Then I'll just keep a lookout
for ladies in distress, as it were.

271
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,367
- That'd be nice.
- Hey, Mandrake Falls!

272
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,328
Security, stop that guy!

273
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:00,747
Stop! Come back!

274
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,001
He'll get $100,000 for the picture.
It'll be on the news in an hour.

275
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,004
He deserves it with those
James Bond moves he just pulled.

276
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,799
No, he deserves to get his throat cut,
the filthy spy. Come on, let's go.

277
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:20,559
So this is where my uncle lived?

278
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:24,188
Yes, sir. For the last 35 years
of his astonishing life.

279
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,900
- You kind of snuck up on me there.
- I am very, very sneaky, sir.

280
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,736
I see that. My name is Deeds.

281
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:33,322
I am Emilio, sir. I am your servant.

282
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:37,784
Servant? I don't want a servant,
but if you want to be my friend, I'll take that.

283
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:39,953
Friends.

284
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:42,372
Yes, good friends.

285
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,711
Would you like to go down to your apartment?
I'm sure it's been an exhausting day.

286
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,756
- That okay with you, Chuck?
- You'll be safe there.

287
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,967
It'll take us a couple days
to draw up the papers for you to sign.

288
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,011
- Go make yourself at home.
- Terrific.

289
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,430
- Later.
- I will be with you shortly, sir.

290
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,558
You got it. Nice to meet you. I'm Deeds.

291
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:05,103
- I'm Reuben, sir.
- This is a wicked nice elevator.

292
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:08,357
Keep an eye on him, Emilio. Or it's your ass.

293
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,067
It's nice to see you too, sir.

294
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,945
So how's the elevator business
treating you, Reuben?

295
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,988
It has its ups and downs.

296
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,533
All right! All right!

297
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,701
That was good.

298
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,121
Jeesum crow, how'd you get down here so fast?

299
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,041
Sneaky-sneaky, sir. Right this way.

300
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:30,838
Wow.

301
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,467
Wow.

302
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,887
Is something the matter, sir?

303
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,101
- That's an echo, sir.
- Yeah, you try it.

304
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,645
- Me, sir?
- It's a lot of fun.

305
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,735
Come on, you can do it louder than that.

306
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,037
- Serious.
- Thank you, sir.

307
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,957
Hey, buddy, how you doing?
You want to give it a shot?

308
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:10,419
Nice.

309
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,299
You guys want to join us? Make a weird noise.

310
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:28,145
That was a great time. Well, I'm tired.
I'd like to go to sleep.

311
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:31,106
- This way.
- Thank you very much. Good night, everyone.

312
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,524
Good night.

313
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,119
You just going to lie there
and let the "Post" take your story?

314
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,843
What's up, New York?

315
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:11,563
He had a water fountain in his room. I love it.

316
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,774
He had a water fountain in his room. I love it.

317
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:23,909
That's Hawaiian Punch.

318
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:25,953
He adored...

319
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,371
...Hawaiian Punch.

320
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:31,667
Wow! You kind of just snuck up on me there.

321
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:35,504
I fear you're underestimating the sneakiness, sir.

322
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,423
I guess I was. What are you doing down there?

323
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,218
I am assisting you with your sock change.

324
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:44,596
You'd change my socks for me?
You don't got to do that. Stand up.

325
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,472
Thank you.

326
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:48,141
Besides, you don't want
to have to touch my right foot.

327
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:51,895
I got wicked bad frostbite when I was
in the Scouts. Check it out.

328
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:58,819
Pretty messed up, huh?

329
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:03,365
The hideousness of that foot
will haunt my dreams forever.

330
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,826
Yeah, I've heard that before.

331
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,037
But the weird thing is I got no feeling left in it.

332
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,874
So you could jump on it and it wouldn't hurt me.

333
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,335
- Go ahead, jump on it.
- I'd really rather not, sir.

334
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,920
Please jump on my foot.

335
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:28,891
I didn't feel that.

336
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:33,061
What else you got? Get that
fireplace poker and whack my foot.

337
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:37,024
- Do I absolutely have to?
- It's going to be fun. Just grab it.

338
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:41,570
All my friends do this when they're wasted.

339
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:42,946
Come on.

340
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,699
Go ahead, give it a whack.

341
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,704
- Nothing.
- Really?

342
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,039
Isn't that sick?

343
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,126
Didn't feel that. Isn't that awesome? Go ahead.

344
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:57,127
Nothing.

345
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,381
You're starting to like it, aren't you?
Chop that wood!

346
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,050
That's it!

347
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,138
You're sick! You're sick!
Why would you do that?

348
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,140
I'm just kidding you, pal.

349
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:15,145
- You had me going there.
- I saw your face, you were like...

350
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:20,609
I got to find out from Cedar and Anderson
what I'm supposed to do today.

351
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:23,820
So could you take that out of my foot?
I'm nailed to the ground.

352
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:25,822
There you go.

353
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:29,618
I must insist on absolute secrecy
regarding this discussion...

354
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,287
...till I've officially acquired Mr. Blake's shares.

355
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,873
If that's acceptable,
then as far as I'm concerned...

356
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:37,417
...you've just bought 2,000 radio stations.

357
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,003
Good morning.

358
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,422
Deeds.

359
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,966
What's up?

360
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:45,926
Doing a little business.

361
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:52,558
This room's an echo room, too.
I'm sure you guys already knew that.

362
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:55,018
May I help you?

363
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:58,188
I just wanted to see
if there's anything I should do today.

364
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,650
I think we've got everything under control.

365
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:06,363
There's got to be something. Until I sign
those papers I own this place, right?

366
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:09,116
What?

367
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:12,035
Ladies and gentlemen,
pardon me a moment, please.

368
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:12,995
Of course.

369
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:16,999
What's up, buddy? I was dreaming
about Frosties all last night. You?

370
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,710
I tried to make my own at home,
but it wasn't the same.

371
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,462
Deeds.

372
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:26,341
Every stockholder, large and small,
has a say in the operation of this company.

373
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:29,011
They have this say
at the annual stockholders' meeting.

374
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:32,681
The other 364 days of the year,
the officers of the company, like me...

375
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,559
...run the show.
- You mean now that my uncle's gone.

376
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,978
Yeah, and it's not all fun and games.

377
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,523
This company is a player on so many levels
and in so many areas...

378
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,860
...that running it is literally a 24-hour-a-day job.

379
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:48,113
I only got three hours of sleep last night.

380
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,158
Then it's actually a 21-hour-a-day job, huh?

381
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,411
Move it, lady.
I don't give a damn about no meeting.

382
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,038
Mr. Cedar, I am sorry...

383
00:24:56,497 --> 00:25:00,876
I passed for 3,500 yards last season
and I ain't gonna touch a football...

384
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:05,380
...until you get off your fat, rich asses
and renegotiate my bullshit contract.

385
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:09,218
Easy with the language, buddy.
There are ladies present.

386
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,804
Shut the hell up, rich boy!

387
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,017
I want more money, or you all can just suck my...

388
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:22,648
I warned you.

389
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,945
You went down like a sack of potatoes,
I'll tell you that much. Come on.

390
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,990
Come on, big man. Upsy-daisy.

391
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,576
Mesdames and Gentlemen, footballl

392
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,913
What's the problem with your contract?

393
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:42,876
I figured if I played well,
I'd renegotiate and get more money.

394
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,463
If you didn't play well,
could we renegotiate and pay you less?

395
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,756
Shit, no!

396
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:49,925
I mean, no.

397
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,095
Doesn't seem fair to me.

398
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:57,140
- He led the League in touchdown passes.
- That's okay, Chuck. I got this one.

399
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,435
Listen, fellows, I want more money...

400
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:03,105
...or I ain't even gonna play another down.

401
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,318
Well, we'll have to let you go then.

402
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:12,197
- "Let me go"?
- Yeah, you're fired.

403
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:15,576
So can I sign with another team?

404
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:18,537
You can do anything.
I suggest you change your attitude...

405
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,747
...or nobody will want to work with you.

406
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:23,250
'Bye.

407
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:25,836
Deeds.

408
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,631
Kevin won the Heisman Trophy two years ago.
He is our best player.

409
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:33,427
- Don't worry, he'll be back.
- Biggest mistake of your lives!

410
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:34,970
This thing is cool.

411
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:39,975
Why don't you get out and enjoy the city?
Everything's fine here. Take that with you.

412
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:43,478
I'll leave it here. That's all right.
But call me if you need me.

413
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:46,648
- Absolutely.
- Thanks. Love you, Anderson.

414
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:51,111
All you guys, I noticed you were French.
The opposite of "bonjour" to you.

415
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:55,991
You look so hot as a blond.

416
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:58,994
It's not too streaky?
I feel like he did it really streaky.

417
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:02,289
I love it, but let me go undercover.
This could get dangerous.

418
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:06,460
He said he likes ladies in distress,
not men who wear too much cologne.

419
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,962
- There he is.
- Thanks for the tour.

420
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:12,424
- You're welcome.
- Hidden cameras on, ready? Molest me.

421
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,344
- Molest me!
- You got it!

422
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,387
- God, help!
- Give it to me.

423
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,598
- Help, I'm being mugged!
- All right!

424
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,142
Help! Help! I'm being mugged!

425
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,312
- Stop it!
- Good luck. See you at the office.

426
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,608
- Don't worry, I'll get him.
- Oh, shit!

427
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,693
Stop right there.

428
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:38,534
Come on!

429
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,331
What's your problem, pal?

430
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:52,881
Come up here.

431
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:57,553
Got your pocketbook. Get a job, pal.

432
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,056
Miss! Miss!

433
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:04,309
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

434
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:05,727
Let me help you up.

435
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:08,939
All right, now. All right.

436
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,781
Ma'am, you were just the victim
of a New York City mugger.

437
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,701
As I suspected, he was a coward and a weakling.

438
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,537
And also wore more cologne
than any man should wear.

439
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,165
- I got this back for you, though.
- Thank you.

440
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,377
- Can I take you to the hospital?
- No, no.

441
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:35,799
I'll be all right.
I just feel a little dizzy and violated.

442
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:37,968
I'm fine.

443
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,390
Please, let me take you to the emergency room.

444
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:47,186
I'm sure I'll be all right. I just need to...

445
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:49,730
...perhaps walk it off or...

446
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,732
- Could you?
- Sure.

447
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:52,858
Thank you.

448
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,402
Thank you so much.

449
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,239
My name is Pam. Pam Dawson.

450
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:04,119
My name is Deeds. I'm not from here.
I'm just visiting.

451
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,080
Where do you hail from?

452
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:12,252
Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire.
Just a little town nobody's ever heard of.

453
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,671
I'm from a little town like that.

454
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:18,509
- In Iowa.
- Is that right? What part?

455
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,138
Winchestertonfieldville.

456
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:29,186
Yes, the small town
of Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa.

457
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,315
I'm sorry.

458
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:36,485
- What are you doing in New York?
- I'm a school nurse.

459
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:41,198
- There's no way you're a school nurse.
- Why, don't you believe me?

460
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:43,784
You're too nice to be a school nurse.

461
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:48,038
My school nurse was so mean,
every time I'd tell her I had a tummy ache...

462
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:51,083
...she'd send me back to my class
and say, "Stop whining."

463
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,919
- But that's awful!
- Well, I said it every day.

464
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:57,589
I missed my mother.

465
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:00,509
That's sweet.

466
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,344
Miss Dawson?

467
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:06,056
How would you like to maybe go out...

468
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:08,475
...and have a New York City dinner with me?

469
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,185
Golly.

470
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:13,647
That sounds wonderful.

471
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:15,274
- It does?
- Yeah.

472
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,985
- Let's do it, then.
- Okay.

473
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,321
Damn you, Old Spice.

474
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:28,537
So you run this pizza place
and you have your poetry.

475
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:31,415
What brings you to the big city?

476
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:34,001
Actually, I just inherited $40 billion.

477
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:39,339
Well, that's nice, but I think anything
over $30 billion is just gravy.

478
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:43,594
I like that.

479
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,598
Your hair is very blond and pretty.

480
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,976
I'm of Swedish ancestry.

481
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,312
- Really?
- Yes.

482
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:57,149
My grandfather was in ABBA.

483
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:00,235
ABBA, the band?

484
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:04,740
Excuse me,
do you get any famous people in here?

485
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,200
Famous, rich, powerful.

486
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:09,119
Really? We don't get
any famous people in Mandrake Falls.

487
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,705
Stephen King stopped by
our gas station one time...

488
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:14,166
...but everyone was too scared to talk to him.

489
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:16,043
I'd imagine he'd be very spooky.

490
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:19,505
Jake, the gas station attendant,
made eye contact with him.

491
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,548
That night he lost 200 pounds.

492
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,718
Wow.

493
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:27,888
Your chicken parmesan should be ready soon.

494
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:32,184
Okay, buddy. I saw a couple over there.
It's their anniversary.

495
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,604
Give them this. Don't say it's from us, though.

496
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:37,814
This is like $20,000.

497
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:41,318
Tell them it was a restaurant giveaway
or something. Thanks, buddy.

498
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,448
That's an awfully nice way
to start spending your money.

499
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,492
- Is that who I think it is?
- Who?

500
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:51,995
Preston Blake's nephew, the $40-billion man.

501
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:54,414
We have to meet him. Dave?

502
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:58,085
Gosh, I hope that mugger got home okay.

503
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,795
- Mr. Deeds.
- Yeah.

504
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:02,923
Mr. Simonds would like
to invite you to join his party.

505
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:04,466
Why is that?

506
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,261
Just to enjoy the pleasure of your company.

507
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:09,346
Wow, that's pretty cool of him.

508
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,519
That was a very nice hug, Deeds.

509
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:19,231
It's wicked nice of you to invite us over.
This is awesome.

510
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:22,609
- Have we met?
- Not unless you have a sick kid.

511
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:26,280
You're a very important man
in this town now, Mr. Deeds.

512
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:27,781
I don't know about that.

513
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:29,658
I sing at the Metropolitan Opera...

514
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:33,453
...and Blake Media contributes
50 percent of our budget.

515
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,455
So, on behalf of the opera:

516
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:39,459
"Thank you"

517
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:43,964
That was awesome!

518
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:47,551
You shouldn't thank me, though.
You should thank my great-uncle.

519
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,011
He was an interesting man.

520
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:51,346
I served on the board
of the Guggenheim with him.

521
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:54,349
Really? I'm not sure what that is,
but good luck with it.

522
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:58,687
I'd love to write a piece on you
for "The New Yorker".

523
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,355
What's "The New Yorker"?

524
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:02,399
It's a magazine.

525
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,111
With essays, witty cartoons.

526
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,782
I read the "Mandrake Falls Gazette"
and they got some cartoons in there also.

527
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:13,410
You know who's a riot? That Beetle Bailey guy.

528
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:16,121
He's always wearing his hat and doing his thing.

529
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:19,541
But it is an honor to meet
a real writer like you, George.

530
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,044
I've been trying
to get my stuff published for years...

531
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:24,546
...but Hallmark is one tough cookie to crack.

532
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,174
- Hallmark?
- He writes greeting cards.

533
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:31,053
- I try.
- You must share one with us.

534
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,723
- I don't know about that, Mr. French.
- Who's Mr. French?

535
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:38,101
- Doesn't he look like Mr. French?
- I've never heard of him.

536
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:39,144
Come on.

537
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:40,854
All right, I'll give you one.

538
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:43,565
This is a Mother's Day card I've been working on.

539
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:47,736
"Mom, you are the one
who brought me to planet Earth

540
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:51,740
"You are the one who suffered
through my 14-hour birth

541
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:56,370
"You are the one who made lemonade for me
after I'd come back from play

542
00:33:56,787 --> 00:34:00,916
"I love you, Mom,
so have a wicked nice Mother's Day"

543
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,835
Something like that.

544
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,880
- An instant classic!
- "Genius, genius, genius"

545
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:09,258
Do you write your poems with a crayon?

546
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:14,888
It's amazing!

547
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:18,976
I see why you brought me here.
To goof on me, huh?

548
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,104
- Don't be silly, Deeds.
- Pipe down, George.

549
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,691
I may seem funny to you,
but if you came to Mandrake Falls...

550
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:28,819
...you might seem funny to us.
Only nobody would laugh at you...

551
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:31,822
...and make you feel stupid,
that wouldn't be good manners.

552
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:35,492
Maybe my poems aren't that great,
but I know some people who like them.

553
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,705
Anyways, it's the best I can do.
We're going to get going.

554
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:43,000
Sorry about that, Pam.
I hope I didn't embarrass you.

555
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:51,633
And if it wasn't for Miss Dawson being here,
I'd knock your heads in.

556
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:52,926
I don't mind.

557
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:54,219
Okay.

558
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:58,891
"No"

559
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:09,484
I think I just shat myself.

560
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,738
How would you like to see the sights now?

561
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:15,324
I just need to powder my nose.

562
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,826
That would be great. I'll get your coat.

563
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:22,247
Hey, buddy, this will pay for everything
I damaged. Sorry about that.

564
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:24,708
- Good to meet you guys.
- Thank you.

565
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,418
God, that was good stuff.

566
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,465
I want a raise, Mac.

567
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:37,721
Hey, man! What's up?

568
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:40,432
Holy cannoli, you're John McEnroe!

569
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:43,560
I saw what you did to those guys
making fun of you. Nice work.

570
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:46,605
You know what it's like to get riled up
don't you, Johnny Mac?

571
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:49,525
- That I do.
- I'm Deeds, by the way.

572
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:53,320
Deeds, nice to meet you.
You got to let me buy you a drink.

573
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,197
Miss Dawson, this is John McEnroe.

574
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:58,909
- Miss Dawson, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

575
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:01,662
I promised Miss Dawson I'd take her sightseeing.

576
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:04,998
The sights are great.
I've seen the sights. I love the sights.

577
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:08,168
Let me show you a New York
most people will never see.

578
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:12,047
- That okay with you, Miss Dawson?
- Sounds like fun!

579
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,591
Here's to a big night on the town.

580
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,730
What happened?

581
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:33,068
Here are some aspirins, Mr. Deeds.
They make your head seem smaller.

582
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:40,242
- How did I get in these pajamas?
- I changed you.

583
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:42,452
I was very gentle, sir.

584
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:47,249
I think I drank all the alcohol in Manhattan
last night.

585
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,127
And you nearly succeeded,
according to Miss Dawson.

586
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:55,340
Miss Dawson! I don't even remember
taking her home. Is she okay?

587
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,468
I took the liberty of sending her off
in the company limousine.

588
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:01,471
She was a lady in distress and I helped her.

589
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,765
Dreamt about her last night.

590
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:07,060
Usually, when you get blackout drunk
you don't dream.

591
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:09,688
So I read.

592
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:15,611
What's up, Chuck?

593
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,283
America's newest billionaire...

594
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:25,078
...stupid and drunk.
- What's this?

595
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:28,081
It was quite a night for Longfellow Deeds.

596
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,751
They'll know my name is Longfellow.

597
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,587
After punching out some society types...

598
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,510
...Deeds joined forces with the original
bad boy of tennis, John McEnroe.

599
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:42,304
And stupidity won in straight sets.

600
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:50,979
How'd they get that footage?

601
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,106
Watch out, Johnny!

602
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:58,987
What kind of driving is that?
You're a fucking disgrace!

603
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,615
No, sir. You're a disgrace.

604
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,992
- We did it, man!
- Johnny McEnroe!

605
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:07,412
Look at Deedsy hanging out with McEnroe!
That's awesome!

606
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:10,040
I love the Beach Boys.

607
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,918
Here I go, here I go.

608
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:18,340
This is not the kind of attention
we need right now.

609
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:19,633
What do you mean?

610
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:22,553
For the moment you're the largest stockholder...

611
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:25,180
...and people might think
any instability you show...

612
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:27,432
...may equal instability in the company.

613
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,479
My bad.

614
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:36,817
My bad. My bad.

615
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,860
Okay. Okay.

616
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:38,944
- My bad.
- Okay.

617
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:42,281
Shall I call your car, Mr. Cedar,
to take you to the funeral?

618
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:43,699
What funeral?

619
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:46,243
Your great-uncle's funeral.

620
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,287
- His funeral's today?
- Today, yes.

621
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:50,414
I'll go get my suit on.

622
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:00,048
- Cute, bigmouth.
- Sir?

623
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,801
As soon as that moron goes back
to Cowpie Falls...

624
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:05,596
...you are out of here
on your fat Puerto Rican ass.

625
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,269
I hail from Spain, sir.

626
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:19,693
Olé.

627
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:25,157
Now, Brother Preston is soaring
with eagles high above.

628
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,036
Because he lived a life of love.

629
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:33,457
Yes, he's flying way up high...

630
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,002
...because he was a supercool guy.

631
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:41,715
He's gone away, too soon, it seems...

632
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:45,260
...leaving behind his unfinished dreams.

633
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:48,347
This guy could make a fortune
writing greeting cards.

634
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,266
Yes, we remember Preston Blake...

635
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,603
...a man with faith no man could shake.

636
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,606
A strength no man could break.

637
00:39:58,148 --> 00:40:00,651
A character no man could fake.

638
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:04,029
For goodness sake, let's eat some cake.

639
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:05,864
Amen.

640
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:10,744
Excuse me, Reverend, that was a grand slam.

641
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:13,747
That part with soaring with the eagles
gave me goosebumps.

642
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:17,334
- Thank you, my brother.
- My friend got me a mug for my birthday.

643
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:21,255
It says, "It's hard to soar with the eagles
when you're surrounded by turkeys."

644
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:23,048
But what you said was better.

645
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,758
It's all good.

646
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:29,054
Rest in peace, Preston.
That concludes today's service.

647
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:32,933
I actually thought I would say something.

648
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:37,312
Deedsy was always the best speaker in school.

649
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:38,939
Deedsy?

650
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,149
That's some job, by the way, Your Majesty.

651
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,485
I thought we were watching "Scooby-Doo".

652
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:48,490
Hi, my name is Deeds.
I was Preston Blake's great-nephew.

653
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:52,244
I wrote a poem for him
on my way over here, in my head.

654
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:54,997
And I'm going to recite it for you.

655
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:59,668
I didn't realize I'd be following
the rhyme-master Reverend Sharpton.

656
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,753
But here we go anyways.

657
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:05,340
"You climbed mountains and built skyscrapers

658
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:10,429
"You made TV shows and put out newspapers

659
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:14,683
"You were wicked good at doing stocks

660
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:18,312
"You liked it
when Emilio would change your socks

661
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,774
"We never hung out and that makes me sad

662
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,986
"All the good times we could've had"

663
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:28,113
Nice rhyme.

664
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:32,034
"But when I die, Uncle Preston,
you'd better say, 'Cheers! '

665
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:35,496
"'Cause me and you are hanging
at the pearly gates

666
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,500
"I'll bring the beers, I'll bring the beers"

667
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:41,251
He's good.

668
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:42,836
Amen.

669
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,548
I know this is supposed to be
a closed casket, but where I come from...

670
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:50,302
...we feel it's good to see the body
for the grieving process, so...

671
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:56,266
Sorry about that! I'll keep this sucker closed.

672
00:42:01,063 --> 00:42:02,898
He's still pretty frozen.

673
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:04,733
Almost there.

674
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:09,446
I'll keep an eye on the company for you.
Love you.

675
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,740
Nice meeting you. Thanks for the apartment.

676
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:13,450
That was freaky.

677
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:15,536
Everybody drive home safe.

678
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:17,913
Man, this guy is in way over his head.

679
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:20,165
- Take care.
- You'll see him tonight?

680
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:23,585
Yes, I'm calling around 4:00.
That's when I get off work.

681
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:29,424
Remember, I'm Pam Dawson, virgin school nurse
from Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa.

682
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:33,053
That's priceless.

683
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,764
You, a virgin.

684
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:44,982
- All right, thank you.
- Excuse me, sir.

685
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,818
- I told him he could have that.
- Thanks.

686
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,486
Right on. Nice seeing you.

687
00:42:49,778 --> 00:42:52,573
You need to use our bathroom,
come back and use it, okay?

688
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:54,616
- Will do!
- All right.

689
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:58,245
How do you think I did at the funeral today?

690
00:42:58,328 --> 00:42:59,830
You spoke beautifully, sir.

691
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:01,415
I still feel bad.

692
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:05,169
I snapped my uncle's hand off
when I put him back in the casket.

693
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:07,588
Lucky for him, he was dead, sir.

694
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:10,507
Even though his face was frozen that way...

695
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:13,844
...it looked to me like he was a happy guy.
Am I right?

696
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:17,055
- He truly was.
- Come on, sit down, please.

697
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:21,018
And I got to hang out with him, just like this...

698
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:23,645
...almost every day for 30 years.

699
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:25,898
What did you guys talk about?

700
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:30,152
We spoke of life, love, art, wine, business.

701
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:32,237
I learned much from him.

702
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,490
- I bet you miss him, too.
- I do.

703
00:43:34,865 --> 00:43:36,825
He was like a parent to me.

704
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:40,662
You see, I never knew my father, and Mama...

705
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:43,707
...she passed while giving the birth to me.

706
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,213
- You want some Cocoa Pebbles?
- No, thanks.

707
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,425
I have much work to do.

708
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:57,012
- Thanks. You don't have to do that.
- Enjoy your Pebbles.

709
00:43:58,388 --> 00:43:59,848
One more thing.

710
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:03,852
Your great-uncle did not let me
change his socks for him, either.

711
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,271
I like feet.

712
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:08,440
I do not know why.

713
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:17,950
Hello.

714
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:20,702
Hi, Deeds? It's Pam. Pam Dawson.

715
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:24,957
I'm so happy you called.
I'm wicked sorry about last night.

716
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,416
I don't drink very often.

717
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:29,586
I thought you held your liquor very well.

718
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,005
Unfortunately, I couldn't hold it for too long.

719
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:35,759
That's okay. I didn't really like that skirt anyway.

720
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:40,514
I'm getting a call on the other line.
Can you hang on for a second?

721
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:42,266
- Sure.
- Thank you.

722
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:43,767
Hello.

723
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:46,937
Mr. Deeds, this is Kevin Ward,
the quarterback you punched.

724
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:48,689
What's up, buddy?

725
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:53,944
I wanted to say that I was thinking it over
and I'd like to live up to my word.

726
00:44:54,236 --> 00:44:56,029
And I'd like to win you a Super Bowl.

727
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:58,740
- That's terrific, pal.
- And my daddy wants to speak to you.

728
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:02,244
Deeds. Buddy Ward here, Kevin's daddy.

729
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:03,662
How you doing, Mr. Ward?

730
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:06,290
I just want to thank you
for teaching my boy a lesson.

731
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:10,252
He's a good kid. He just has to watch
his language in front of ladies.

732
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:15,048
I'll remind Kevin where he comes from.

733
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:16,925
That sounds terrific.

734
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:20,345
You used foul language in front of a lady?

735
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:22,139
No, Daddy, no!

736
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:27,227
Pam.

737
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:28,604
Still here.

738
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:30,230
How's it going? You at work?

739
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:33,817
- Yep, here in the nurse's office.
- Any customers?

740
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:36,778
Customers? Oh, sick kids.

741
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:41,074
Well, little Billy Barty's here.

742
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:46,914
- You're not feeling too good, Billy?
- Miss Dawson, my tummy hurts.

743
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:49,666
Why don't you just lay back and relax?

744
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:51,793
That was nice. Good job.

745
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:55,714
I've got too much doo-doo in my underpants.

746
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,134
Make the stinky go away.

747
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:02,346
Well, you sound like
you got your hands full, so...

748
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,306
...l'll just come out with it.

749
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:07,309
How would you like
to do something with me tonight?

750
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:09,978
I'd love to do something with you.

751
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:11,104
Great.

752
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:13,982
We can't go out drinking.
I got our company in trouble.

753
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:17,653
That's okay.
I was brought up never to drink alcohol.

754
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,364
Not even rum raisin ice cream.

755
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:22,950
I like that. I'll think of something good.

756
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:24,660
See you tonight.

757
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,911
Okay. 'Bye.

758
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,583
I got to try this.

759
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:45,806
Was that awesome?

760
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:49,184
Am I out or safe?

761
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:52,479
I'm with you.

762
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:58,068
What is this? My great-uncle's personal journal.

763
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:02,072
- Should I read it?
- Family.

764
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:05,617
Family, safe, good.

765
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:09,705
All right, have a good night. My back hurts!

766
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:16,920
- Nice doing business with you.
- Thank you.

767
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,547
Thanks for the bikes.

768
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,133
What are you gonna do with your $20,000?

769
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:24,052
Buy a giraffe.
What are you gonna do with your $20,000?

770
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:25,554
Quit school.

771
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:29,808
Good idea, school is for fools. Look at me!

772
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,127
The park is beautiful.

773
00:47:58,045 --> 00:48:01,632
These trees, they remind you
of Winchestertonfieldville at all?

774
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:05,093
Oh, yes. Very much so.

775
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:07,888
What was it like growing up there?

776
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:09,139
It was great.

777
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:13,769
I remember walking down
to the corner drugstore...

778
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,104
...and getting malted milkshakes.

779
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:19,024
What was your house like?

780
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:21,777
We had this big Victorian.

781
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:24,196
Right off Main Street.

782
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:29,159
- Blue shutters and a big red door.
- All right.

783
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:33,622
- And a tire swing in the front yard.
- I love it.

784
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:38,627
And I remember the time I fell out of
old Boo Radley's apple tree...

785
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:40,128
...and broke my arm.

786
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:45,217
And my father, before he passed away...

787
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:47,928
...from the disease of the lepers...

788
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:52,307
...he came and he scooped me up
and he ran me all the way to Dr. Pepper's.

789
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:55,143
Dr. Pepper.

790
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:56,937
Yeah.

791
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:58,981
I'm glad that guy was around.

792
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:02,151
- Want to sit down?
- Sure.

793
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:05,654
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

794
00:49:06,405 --> 00:49:09,867
I was reading my great-uncle's journal
on my way over to you.

795
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,202
And, when he was age 9...

796
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:16,039
...he wrote that he had the only family
on the block with a radio...

797
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:19,042
...and he was dreaming
of becoming a disc jockey someday.

798
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:21,461
A disc jockey?

799
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:27,009
You know, when I was a kid,
I wanted to be a news reporter.

800
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:30,846
I used to go around interviewing everyone...

801
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:33,724
...and writing notes
in my little Holly Hobby notebook.

802
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:39,146
People didn't like that. I got beat up a lot.

803
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:43,275
- Do you remember their names?
- No, it was a long time ago.

804
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:46,195
But my grandma said to me:

805
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,781
"One day you'll grow up
and work for 60 Minutes"...

806
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:51,950
"...and make a difference in the world."

807
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:56,413
You do make a difference in the world,
every day. You're a school nurse.

808
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,211
Anyways, this is what happened to my uncle.

809
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:06,507
Later on in his life, he'd go
to this radio station that he owned...

810
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:09,510
...at 3:00 in the morning and DJ for an hour.

811
00:50:09,593 --> 00:50:10,844
That's great.

812
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:15,015
So, don't give up hope.
You'll be a reporter someday.

813
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,184
If you really want to.

814
00:50:18,644 --> 00:50:20,229
That would be nice.

815
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:25,484
- Jeesum Crow, a fire!
- A fire?

816
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:27,861
- We should help.
- We should?

817
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:29,863
- Let's get going.
- To the fire?

818
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:34,159
- Fifi, get over here right now.
- Come on, we'll catch you.

819
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:37,746
Go away! I can't leave without my kitties.
They're all I got.

820
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:39,998
Crazy lady!

821
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:43,085
- Oh, babies, where are you?
- Up there now, get going!

822
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:48,090
Longfellow Deeds, Mandrake Falls
volunteer fire chief. I'll be up there in a jiff.

823
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:50,801
- He's crazy.
- He's going up there right now, though.

824
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:53,387
- Look at him.
- Where's he going?

825
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:55,639
Watch it, man!

826
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:58,475
- Sully, who's that guy up there?
- I don't know.

827
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,186
He says he's from
the Mandrake Falls Fire Department.

828
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:06,024
- How's he climb like that?
- He must have monkey blood in him.

829
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,777
It's an honor to work
with New York's bravest guys.

830
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:10,237
Be careful!

831
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,699
- I'll get you.
- Babies, where are you?

832
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:16,034
- Ma'am!
- Lord, it's hot in here.

833
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:19,621
- Kitties, come to Mommy.
- Calm down. Everything will be all right.

834
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:21,957
Okay, but I'm not leaving without my kitties.

835
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:23,584
- How many do you got?
- Seven.

836
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:25,919
Holy shit! Let's get cracking.

837
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:30,215
- I apologize for the language.
- Apology accepted.

838
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,890
- Fire excites me.
- Knock yourself out.

839
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,102
- Come here.
- That's Freddy.

840
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:45,939
- Here we go!
- Oh, my children!

841
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,948
- Nice catch, Pam!
- Good throw, Deeds!

842
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:09,630
- That's Frobo. Thank you, darling.
- Coming at you, boys.

843
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:14,885
I'll take that.

844
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:17,971
- There's a lot more.
- Okay, okay.

845
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:31,902
Holy shit, it's a cat!

846
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:37,825
Full snap. I got you, kitty.

847
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,703
Nice grab!

848
00:52:43,205 --> 00:52:44,373
One more to go.

849
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:47,042
Fifi, where are you?

850
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:51,296
- I think I found Fifi.
- Oh, good!

851
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:54,049
Hang in there, buddy!

852
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:56,760
I got it!

853
00:53:04,518 --> 00:53:06,395
Okay, let's do this together.

854
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:09,189
Be careful!

855
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:11,692
All right, they do it all the time. Here we go.

856
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:16,446
Oh, shit!

857
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:20,993
Deeds.

858
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,870
I'm okay.

859
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:24,538
Are you okay?

860
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:28,167
Yes, I am. Thanks to you!

861
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:31,920
You're hurting me!

862
00:53:36,175 --> 00:53:38,385
Longfellow Deeds is at it again.

863
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:41,180
His latest victim, Coretta Keeling...

864
00:53:41,263 --> 00:53:44,057
...whose only crime
was loving her cats too much.

865
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:46,393
And letting Deeds find out about it.

866
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:49,021
- I'll get youl
- Go awayl

867
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:51,815
- I love it.
- Here comes twol

868
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:57,946
- Cat killerl
- After he finished with her cats...

869
00:53:57,988 --> 00:54:00,741
"...he turned his sights on Miss Keeling herself."

870
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,369
My God!

871
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:06,288
That's not what I shot.

872
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,916
Has Longfellow Deeds been locked up?
Of course not.

873
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:13,295
While the rest of us obey the law,
rich playboys like himself get to laugh at it.

874
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:18,675
Longfellow Deeds. Our jackass of the week.

875
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:21,887
What the hell? Who edited that?

876
00:54:22,221 --> 00:54:26,558
I did. Your first cut was great,
but I needed to spice it up a bit.

877
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,811
The truth was a great story.

878
00:54:29,186 --> 00:54:32,147
He saved that woman and her seven cats.

879
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:35,150
- He was heroic!
- Heroic is nice.

880
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:37,820
- Depraved and insane is better.
- Hell, yeah!

881
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:41,865
This footage you're getting, gorgeous.
Keep it coming!

882
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:45,494
God, how can we do this to such a sweet guy?

883
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:47,621
Sweet? Sweet?

884
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:49,832
Look at me!

885
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:53,252
Was he sweet when he gave me
the most savage beating of my life?

886
00:54:53,544 --> 00:54:55,838
- You were mugging me!
- Babe!

887
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:59,967
No one is as good as this guy's pretending to be.

888
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:02,094
Don't be a sucker.

889
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:04,304
He doesn't deserve this.

890
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,308
He doesn't deserve you.

891
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:11,228
My neck!

892
00:55:15,899 --> 00:55:20,112
I feel like an idiot.
They made me look like a fool, Jan.

893
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:23,824
I was thinking of going down
to that 'Inside Access' place...

894
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:27,244
...and giving Mac McGrath
the beating of a lifetime.

895
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:30,956
That sounds like fun,
but don't stoop to their level.

896
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:33,292
You're better than that, Deedsy.

897
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:37,212
So hang in there.
And know that we are always here for you.

898
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:42,634
Thanks, Jan.
My uncle really built an amazing company.

899
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:46,430
Because of him, 50,000 people have jobs.

900
00:55:46,972 --> 00:55:49,474
And he always tried to do the right thing.

901
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,811
Well, he does sound amazing.

902
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:56,565
But don't forget, he was related to you.

903
00:55:57,024 --> 00:56:01,361
Enough about that. Tell me more about this girl.

904
00:56:02,613 --> 00:56:06,241
She's nice, a small-town kid, like me.

905
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:10,037
Deedsy, you sick-ass mo' fo'...

906
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,582
You got to tap that
before she starts boning other guys, kid.

907
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,209
Boo-Yahl

908
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:20,672
He thinks it's you! He thinks it's you!

909
00:56:22,299 --> 00:56:26,428
- Let's go, Cedar. Put some steam on it, kid.
- Here it comes.

910
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:31,725
He's trying to kill me. You're good at this.

911
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:35,062
When you asked me to play,
I thought you'd done this before.

912
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:37,856
No, Johnny McEnroe said it was wicked easy.

913
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:40,317
Plus, it was my uncle's favorite game, right?

914
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,028
- How'd you know that?
- I read it in his diary.

915
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:44,947
Really?

916
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:47,783
I didn't know he kept a diary.

917
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:53,622
Sorry about that, dude.

918
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:56,083
It's okay. He's a new member.

919
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:57,960
Ball boy.

920
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:00,045
Ball boy!

921
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:04,424
All right, baby, I'm ready for you.

922
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:10,264
You okay?

923
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:13,308
- Not a problem.
- Anderson, you liked that, didn't you?

924
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,518
I did.

925
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:17,146
Listen, Deeds, I got some good news.

926
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:19,398
Those papers will be ready to sign tomorrow.

927
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:22,734
So you can relax knowing
your uncle's company'll be in good hands...

928
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:25,195
...and you can go home $40 billion richer.

929
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:27,865
I was thinking about
maybe sticking around here...

930
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:30,367
...and going to some meetings with you.
- What?

931
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:33,996
Fault!

932
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,790
I figured I could learn, like this tennis thing.

933
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,088
I swear to God, I'm not trying to do that.

934
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,925
I don't got to sell my shares right away, do I?

935
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:51,513
Plus, I met this girl, Cedar.
I swear to God, I think she's the one.

936
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:54,600
That's wonderful for you.

937
00:57:57,644 --> 00:57:59,646
That got you right in the throat, huh?

938
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:04,526
Got to ask you, though, if it hits you,
is it my point or yours?

939
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:06,904
- Yours.
- I'm winning then, I guess.

940
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:16,079
"Deeds info, meet in shower"?

941
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:22,753
Sweet Jesus!

942
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:26,798
Who are you? And what do you want to tell me?

943
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,718
I'm a junior producer at 'Inside Access'.

944
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:34,264
I have information that will help you
get Deeds out of town. Interested?

945
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,228
Very. Provided the information is good
and you stop soaping your ass.

946
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:45,943
- You know Deeds' girlfriend?
- The school nurse.

947
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:47,945
Not quite.

948
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,450
Lucy, bring me the overnights.
J.D. will tell you where they are.

949
00:58:54,076 --> 00:58:56,411
Hey. What the hell are you doing in my chair?

950
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:58,455
Chuck Cedar.

951
00:58:59,248 --> 00:59:01,667
I think you and I could help each other out.

952
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:09,383
- You excited about this trip?
- I'm so excited.

953
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:13,178
- Where are you taking me?
- I told you, that's a surprise.

954
00:59:20,185 --> 00:59:21,228
Well?

955
00:59:23,272 --> 00:59:25,941
"Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa."

956
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,735
You got to be shitting me.

957
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,196
I never heard you curse before.

958
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:32,990
I'm that excited!

959
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:41,456
All you Winchestertonfieldvillians,
recognize this little girl?

960
00:59:44,251 --> 00:59:47,462
I'll give you a hint.
"I fell out of Boo Radley's apple tree...

961
00:59:47,546 --> 00:59:49,464
"...and my arm is killing me!"

962
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:55,596
Come on, it's little Pammy Dawson!

963
00:59:57,806 --> 00:59:58,807
Hello.

964
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:01,477
You related to Bill Dawson?

965
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:04,646
Yes, he's my relative.

966
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:06,815
I think I remember you.

967
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:10,360
Did you used to have a hump on your back?

968
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:15,282
- Yes, that was me. I had a slight hump.
- Really?

969
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:16,992
This was no slight hump.

970
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:21,079
The girl I'm thinking of looked like
she had a damn beach ball on her back.

971
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:25,584
Okay, it was a huge hump
and I'm a little sensitive about it.

972
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:28,921
Look, Martha, it's Quasimodo, all growed up.

973
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:32,341
How wonderful! I thought you died.

974
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:35,552
She actually became a school nurse.

975
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:37,471
- You're a nurse?
- Yes.

976
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:39,348
What should I do about this?

977
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:49,191
- I would call Dr. Pepper.
- Who?

978
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:53,654
It was so great seeing everybody again.
We're going to leave now.

979
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:54,863
'Bye.

980
01:00:56,657 --> 01:00:58,033
- Hi, mailman.
- 'Morning.

981
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,409
How you doing?

982
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:04,540
Oh, my God, there it is.

983
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:09,127
Blue shutters, red door, tire swing.
That's your house, isn't it?

984
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:11,839
Wouldn't you know it?

985
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:13,841
Come on.

986
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:19,054
How you guys doing? You know who she is?

987
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:23,517
She used to live in this house
when she was a little girl.

988
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:24,560
It's true.

989
01:01:24,643 --> 01:01:27,896
You live here and she used to live here.
You're practically cousins.

990
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:32,734
So many memories.

991
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:35,904
Where to begin?

992
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:39,199
This is our fireplace...

993
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:42,244
...where my dad would build fires...

994
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:44,079
...out of wood.

995
01:01:44,163 --> 01:01:47,916
And this is the dining room,
where we would have our meals...

996
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:49,168
...made of food.

997
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:52,129
And this was my brother's room.

998
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:54,923
My parents hated my brother.

999
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:58,719
My daddy built this house
with his bare hands six years ago.

1000
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,346
Your daddy is a liar.

1001
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:03,682
How come you...

1002
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:09,771
He's choking. We should go.

1003
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:11,773
- Help.
- What are you talking about?

1004
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:14,026
- You're the nurse, help him.
- Save him!

1005
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:16,737
- Stand back, kids.
- He's gonna die!

1006
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:19,490
- Take him to the hospital!
- Smack it out!

1007
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,326
- Save him!
- Get it out of him!

1008
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:23,911
Save him, please!

1009
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:31,877
- That was amazing.
- Thank you.

1010
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:33,962
I saved his life.

1011
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:36,840
You're my hero, Nurse Dawson.

1012
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:43,305
Thank you, thank you.

1013
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:47,059
- Good parking job, buddy.
- Thanks, Deeds.

1014
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:47,726
Testing, testing.

1015
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:49,228
Testing, testing.

1016
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:51,730
I had such a wonderful time.

1017
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:54,525
Thank you for such a great day.

1018
01:02:56,193 --> 01:03:00,030
- Thanks for showing me your town.
- I hope sometime to see your hometown.

1019
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:03,408
Maybe someday this will be my new hometown.

1020
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,661
Deeds.

1021
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:09,623
- There's something I have to tell you.
- What's the matter?

1022
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:12,835
What?

1023
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:17,506
Go back to New Hampshire and enjoy being rich.

1024
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:19,341
Just...

1025
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:22,553
...don't let anyone hurt you anymore, okay?

1026
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:25,305
Sucker.

1027
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:29,268
Pam.

1028
01:03:31,395 --> 01:03:32,980
I made a card for you.

1029
01:03:33,689 --> 01:03:35,023
It's kind of dumb.

1030
01:03:35,107 --> 01:03:38,944
I never worked on anything harder, though,
so don't laugh at me.

1031
01:03:40,696 --> 01:03:43,448
Remember we went to the restaurant
that first night...

1032
01:03:43,532 --> 01:03:45,450
...and you ordered chicken parmesan?

1033
01:03:45,534 --> 01:03:47,202
So I drew you a plate.

1034
01:03:47,953 --> 01:03:50,497
There's the chicken and the cheese...

1035
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:54,418
...and the linguini. That took me
a long time with the squigglies.

1036
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:57,171
It's beautiful.

1037
01:03:57,588 --> 01:03:59,673
There's a poem inside for you.

1038
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:07,181
"Hard to breathe, feels like floating

1039
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:11,226
"So full of love my heart's exploding

1040
01:04:13,437 --> 01:04:15,731
"Mouth is dry, hands are shaking

1041
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:19,151
"My heart is yours for the taking

1042
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:23,697
"Acting weird, not myself

1043
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:28,994
"Dancing around like the Keebler elf"

1044
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:31,079
That was funny.

1045
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:35,918
"Finally time for this poor schlub

1046
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:39,421
"to know how it feels to fall in lub"

1047
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:43,800
I couldn't think of anything else
that rhymes with "schlub."

1048
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:45,636
"Rub" and "tub" didn't work.

1049
01:04:55,562 --> 01:04:57,064
I'm sorry, Deeds.

1050
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:03,862
- I'm really sorry.
- Don't be sorry, that was unbelievable.

1051
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:11,537
Hi, Mrs. Finch... Atticus.

1052
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:14,289
Sleep well.

1053
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:21,296
- Al, I'm gonna walk home.
- Okay, Deeds.

1054
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,100
I love New York!

1055
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:35,018
Nobody cares!

1056
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:44,153
I'm in love with him.

1057
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:48,323
I'm going to see him tonight
and tell him everything.

1058
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:53,829
- He'll probably punch you in the face.
- I kind of hope he does.

1059
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:56,248
Come on, Babe, snap out of it.

1060
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:59,793
You really want to throw all this away
for a dipshit like that?

1061
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:04,381
He's not a dipshit. He's a goodhearted guy
who we think is a weirdo...

1062
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:08,302
...because he doesn't share
our sense of ironic detachment.

1063
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:12,556
- All this hip, snide, smart-alecky...
- Bullshit?

1064
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:14,099
Yes, bullshit.

1065
01:06:14,725 --> 01:06:19,021
Well, in a few moments,
I'll put on my Versace overcoat...

1066
01:06:19,062 --> 01:06:22,816
...get into my Mercedes,
drive to my Fifth Avenue apartment...

1067
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:26,153
...and squeeze my girlfriend's big, fake boobs.

1068
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:30,657
And that bullshit you're talking about
paid for all of it.

1069
01:06:31,325 --> 01:06:34,369
Good for you, Mac. But I'm still telling him.

1070
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:35,787
Well...

1071
01:06:37,581 --> 01:06:39,500
Babe Bennett falls in love.

1072
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:43,462
I'm happy for you. I am.

1073
01:06:44,755 --> 01:06:46,215
Gonna miss you, Babe.

1074
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:48,509
Something fierce.

1075
01:07:17,788 --> 01:07:19,498
You think she'll like this?

1076
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:21,083
All right.

1077
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:24,628
Chicken parmesan? Terrific, thank you.

1078
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:26,630
Let's hear it.

1079
01:07:29,925 --> 01:07:32,553
- She gonna like that, Mr. Deeds.
- Okay.

1080
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:35,764
- Emilio, it looks beautiful.
- Thank you.

1081
01:07:39,852 --> 01:07:42,980
These roses might be a little too high.
I won't be able to see her.

1082
01:07:43,063 --> 01:07:45,232
- Do we have anything smaller?
- Yes, sir.

1083
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:46,275
Okay.

1084
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:48,193
Byron?

1085
01:07:48,944 --> 01:07:50,070
That's terrific.

1086
01:07:50,821 --> 01:07:53,407
- Would you mind sitting for a second?
- Yes, sir.

1087
01:07:55,951 --> 01:07:58,162
Say something to me. Pretend you're her.

1088
01:07:58,245 --> 01:08:00,247
- Me, sir?
- Please.

1089
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:02,207
Well...

1090
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:07,129
...it's nice of you to have invited me
to dine with you this evening.

1091
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:08,839
It's my pleasure.

1092
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:11,592
Actually, you're too tall. Can you slink down?

1093
01:08:13,635 --> 01:08:15,304
- Like this?
- That's good.

1094
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:19,558
This is one of the best dates I've ever been on.

1095
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,603
You make me feel very special.

1096
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:25,481
You make me feel very special, too.

1097
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:28,066
That's why I got this for you.

1098
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:30,652
Okay, lean forward.

1099
01:08:35,616 --> 01:08:38,785
- I really like you a lot.
- I like you, too.

1100
01:08:39,036 --> 01:08:42,789
- I can't stop thinking about you.
- I can't stop thinking about you.

1101
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:44,500
Please let me touch your feet.

1102
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:48,045
Okay, this is getting weird.
You can stand up now.

1103
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:53,467
- Deeds!
- Fellows!

1104
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:56,803
We wanted to come and wish you
the best on your big night.

1105
01:08:56,845 --> 01:09:00,974
Thanks a lot. I'm so nervous.
I never asked anybody to marry me before.

1106
01:09:01,016 --> 01:09:03,602
It's 7:30, time for 'Inside Access'.

1107
01:09:03,685 --> 01:09:06,146
We're not in for any more
nasty surprises, are we?

1108
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:10,317
I don't think so. I haven't done
anything stupid all day. I've been here.

1109
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:14,238
Let's see what lame show they put on
when they don't have Deeds to pick on.

1110
01:09:14,613 --> 01:09:16,031
Excuse me!

1111
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:20,536
- Could you put on Channel 8, please?
- You got it.

1112
01:09:23,121 --> 01:09:25,791
"Welcome to 'Inside Access'. I'm Mac McGrath."

1113
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:30,420
"All of us here at "I. A." take pride"
in our ability to handle...

1114
01:09:30,504 --> 01:09:33,048
...every story with sensitivity and empathy...

1115
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:33,924
Okay, pal.

1116
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:36,885
...while maintaining
an appropriate journalistic distance.

1117
01:09:36,969 --> 01:09:41,515
"But what happens when a reporter"
"becomes part of what she's reporting?"

1118
01:09:41,598 --> 01:09:45,477
What happens when a journalist
falls in love with an idiot?

1119
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:48,939
That's Longfellow Deeds with Pam Dawson.

1120
01:09:49,231 --> 01:09:51,859
- I can't believe they involved her in this.
- A school nurse...

1121
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:55,445
...who recently moved to New York City
"from Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa."

1122
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:59,408
But wait. Doesn't Pam Dawson
bear a striking resemblance to...

1123
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:03,120
...Babe Bennett,
"a producer here at 'Inside Access'?"

1124
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:06,123
In fact, the two are one and the same.

1125
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:09,877
"We'll wire your apartment"
"with state-of-the-art surveillance video."

1126
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:11,753
Sounds good.

1127
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:13,797
Deeds.

1128
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:23,765
I came here to try to explain.

1129
01:10:53,086 --> 01:10:55,297
I'm the biggest sucker in the world.

1130
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,966
This town can be brutal.

1131
01:10:58,634 --> 01:11:00,135
I don't belong here.

1132
01:11:00,219 --> 01:11:03,138
I can't run the company,
I can't even run my own life.

1133
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,766
Sure you can.
The good news is the papers are ready.

1134
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:09,311
Once you sign them, we'll get our stock
and you'll get your $40 billion.

1135
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:12,314
I don't want that money. Just give it to a charity.

1136
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:16,485
- What's a good charity?
- The United Negro College Fund?

1137
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:18,445
Okay, give it to those guys.

1138
01:11:24,368 --> 01:11:28,121
Can we give you a ride to the airport?
The company chopper will take you home.

1139
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:30,666
Thanks, anyway. I'll be all right on my own.

1140
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:34,294
- Nice meeting you all.
- Nice meeting you, Deeds.

1141
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:39,258
Goodbye!

1142
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:42,177
Goodbye.

1143
01:12:27,014 --> 01:12:28,140
It's not right.

1144
01:12:28,849 --> 01:12:30,142
It's not right.

1145
01:12:57,252 --> 01:12:59,379
You must be Jan. My name is...

1146
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:02,591
I know who you are. Wham-bam Dawson.

1147
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:05,719
A. K. A. Little Miss Slut-Slut.

1148
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:09,139
Okay, I deserve that.

1149
01:13:09,223 --> 01:13:11,433
Do you have any idea how much you hurt him?

1150
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:13,977
You're not getting anywhere near that boy.

1151
01:13:14,061 --> 01:13:17,940
I have to find him and there's nothing
you can do to stop me.

1152
01:13:19,525 --> 01:13:23,737
- There's a lot I can do to stop you.
- He needs to know how bad I feel.

1153
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:26,782
And that I would go to the end of the earth...

1154
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:30,786
...I would do anything
to take back what I did to him.

1155
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:34,581
I'm sorry, all I heard was,
"Blah, blah, I'm a dirty tramp."

1156
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,460
Tell you what. You get by me...

1157
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:42,214
...l'll tell you where he is.

1158
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:49,930
Feeling crazy!

1159
01:13:52,683 --> 01:13:54,017
Come to Mama.

1160
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,987
I was a rodeo clown for six years.
You'll have to step it up a notch, shorty.

1161
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,613
You mean like this?

1162
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:14,329
Where were you kicking?
I ain't got no balls, dummy!

1163
01:14:15,164 --> 01:14:16,123
Get up!

1164
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:19,334
- Put me down!
- You got it!

1165
01:14:23,755 --> 01:14:27,050
- Just tell me where Deeds is.
- Bring your bony ass over here.

1166
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:32,014
I want to cut you into eight slices of bitch-eroni.

1167
01:14:46,028 --> 01:14:47,321
Are you all right?

1168
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:50,699
Good kick, honey. Good kick.

1169
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:55,746
Crazy Eyes!

1170
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:04,796
- All right.
- Here you go.

1171
01:15:05,589 --> 01:15:07,841
Peanut butter and gumballs. Nice combo.

1172
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:11,261
Don't worry about what happened.
Time heals all things.

1173
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:14,223
Except these crazy eyes.

1174
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:16,850
It's good to be home. I know that much.

1175
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:21,313
I wasn't talking to you, Deeds.
I was talking to that squirrel over there.

1176
01:15:23,941 --> 01:15:26,193
Although it's a shame about that Cedar fellow...

1177
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:29,696
...tearing apart your uncle's company
and firing all those nice people.

1178
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:30,823
Where'd you hear that?

1179
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:33,242
I watch the stock market channel all the time.

1180
01:15:33,575 --> 01:15:37,287
I just watch because I suspect that anchorman
of being an evil leprechaun.

1181
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:40,415
He can bullshit everybody else,
but he ain't fooling me.

1182
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,296
There it is.

1183
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:56,765
Someone!

1184
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:58,308
Help!

1185
01:16:04,022 --> 01:16:05,899
Deeds! Help!

1186
01:16:07,442 --> 01:16:09,570
Deeds! Help!

1187
01:16:09,653 --> 01:16:11,363
Oh, God! Deeds!

1188
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:23,959
Oh, my God!

1189
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:35,596
Where do you got the camera hidden,
in the woods?

1190
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:36,847
No camera.

1191
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:39,433
I'm so cold. Please!

1192
01:16:39,683 --> 01:16:41,560
You gonna get mugged in there, too?

1193
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:43,103
I'm so...

1194
01:16:44,104 --> 01:16:45,063
...sorry.

1195
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:48,275
I really love you.

1196
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:50,652
Bullshit!

1197
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:17,471
I'm coming!

1198
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:22,601
Go down! Go down!

1199
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:24,561
Here comes the black foot.

1200
01:17:26,605 --> 01:17:27,606
No!

1201
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:33,612
I know it's gross, but grab it.

1202
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,327
I got you. I got you.

1203
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:45,499
- Oh, God, your foot is disgusting!
- I know, I know. Come here.

1204
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:48,585
Come on, you okay? You okay?

1205
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:50,546
I think so.

1206
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:56,885
You didn't really fall out of an apple tree,
did you?

1207
01:17:58,887 --> 01:17:59,888
No.

1208
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:04,059
But I really love you.

1209
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:08,313
I don't even know who you are.

1210
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:10,691
I'm sorry.

1211
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:39,094
I am so sorry.

1212
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:51,565
A company in tatters. Preston Blake's
great legacy gone to the highest bidder.

1213
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:55,360
The shocking announcement from Chuck Cedar
today confirmed that Blake Media...

1214
01:18:55,444 --> 01:18:58,280
...will be stripped down
and sold off piece by piece.

1215
01:18:58,614 --> 01:19:01,992
The only man who could stand up
to Mr. Cedar and save the company...

1216
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:06,580
...Longfellow Deeds, has apparently
given up his voting rights and left the city.

1217
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:09,791
"The sale's expected to pass"
with unanimous consent...

1218
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:13,795
...at the annual stockholders' meeting
here in New York tomorrow afternoon.

1219
01:19:14,254 --> 01:19:17,841
"Sources indicate that virtually"
"all of Blake's 50,000 employees..."

1220
01:19:17,925 --> 01:19:20,385
...are likely to lose their jobs.

1221
01:19:20,469 --> 01:19:22,513
Wait a minute. I'm a Blake employee.

1222
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:26,016
Holy shit! This sucks.

1223
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:30,938
Ladies and gentlemen,
the bottom line is that this divestiture...

1224
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:35,984
...will result in every shareholder,
all of you and myself included...

1225
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:39,363
...getting a substantial premium for our shares.

1226
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:44,827
But before we vote, the company bylaws
require me to open the floor...

1227
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:48,705
...to shareholders for statements
either for or against this buyout plan.

1228
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:51,208
Does anyone wish to make a statement?

1229
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:55,254
Dismantling this company
would be an insult to a great man.

1230
01:19:56,088 --> 01:19:57,130
You scared me.

1231
01:19:57,589 --> 01:20:01,760
It is an unspeakable outrage
and it cannot be allowed to happen.

1232
01:20:05,597 --> 01:20:07,808
Excuse me. I got a statement.

1233
01:20:10,561 --> 01:20:12,146
Longfellow Deeds.

1234
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:15,232
"Unfortunately, since you sold me"
"your 300 million shares..."

1235
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:18,735
...you've no right to speak at this meeting.
- Unfortunately for you...

1236
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:21,530
...I bought one share of Blake Media
this morning.

1237
01:20:21,613 --> 01:20:24,366
You told me every stockholder
has a say in this company.

1238
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:26,326
Even the little guy.

1239
01:20:28,662 --> 01:20:33,041
You have two minutes, but remember,
I control 49 percent of this company.

1240
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:36,253
You're gonna have to persuade
just about everyone else...

1241
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:37,838
"...to start hating money."

1242
01:20:45,596 --> 01:20:47,806
Hello, everybody. I'm Deeds."

1243
01:20:48,724 --> 01:20:51,810
"For a little while, I was a big part of this company."

1244
01:20:52,394 --> 01:20:54,688
"I was wicked rich and powerful."

1245
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:58,192
"Now being rich and powerful isn't a bad thing."

1246
01:20:59,318 --> 01:21:03,238
It looks like the Monopoly guy over there
is pretty darned psyched about it.

1247
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,242
But the problem is
what can happen when you decide...

1248
01:21:07,326 --> 01:21:11,705
...that you would do absolutely anything
"to become rich and powerful."

1249
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:14,625
I don't know who licked the red off
your lollipop today...

1250
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:17,044
...but you are preaching to the wrong choir.

1251
01:21:17,377 --> 01:21:19,546
All I'm saying is, when you were kids...

1252
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:22,800
...did you dream
about becoming a savvy investor one day...

1253
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:25,969
...who would think with his wallet
"instead of his heart?"

1254
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,972
Come on, I know I didn't.

1255
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:31,225
I wanted to be a fireman.

1256
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:35,395
I wanted to be the guy everybody called on
if they were in trouble.

1257
01:21:35,813 --> 01:21:37,397
I wanted to help people...

1258
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,567
...and yeah, I wanted to slide down
those wicked awesome poles.

1259
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:45,405
But money,
that was the last thing I thought about.

1260
01:21:46,365 --> 01:21:49,451
What about you, sir?
Did you want to be a fireman?

1261
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:50,869
No, I did not.

1262
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:54,665
Truth be told, I wanted to be a veterinarian.

1263
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:57,209
Cool. Why would you want to do that?

1264
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:01,004
- I wanted to help sick animals.
- And what do you do now?

1265
01:22:01,421 --> 01:22:03,423
I own a chain of slaughterhouses.

1266
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:06,760
You kind of went the other way
on that one, didn't you?

1267
01:22:07,803 --> 01:22:08,679
Okay.

1268
01:22:08,762 --> 01:22:11,348
In the back. Come on.
Tell me what you wanted to be.

1269
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:13,642
I wanted to be a magician.

1270
01:22:15,269 --> 01:22:19,314
- And what do you do now?
- I operate a pornographic website.

1271
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:24,111
That makes people happy also, I guess.
But kind of in a grosser way.

1272
01:22:25,404 --> 01:22:27,739
- Who else?
- I wanted to be a senator.

1273
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:32,119
- I wanted to be a florist.
- International House Pancake.

1274
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:34,288
I wanted to be a man.

1275
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:38,333
That explains a lot.

1276
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:41,128
I wanted to be a Ping-Pong champion.

1277
01:22:43,964 --> 01:22:46,842
But you're not those things
you wanted to be, are you?

1278
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:51,138
Everybody made a compromise,
then another compromise, and now...

1279
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:56,101
"...you're about to put 50,000 people out of work,"
to make a quick buck? Come on.

1280
01:22:56,602 --> 01:22:59,980
"I bet if we ran into the 6th-grade versions"
of ourselves right now...

1281
01:23:00,022 --> 01:23:03,025
...they would kick our asses
and put Bubble Yum in our hair...

1282
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:05,194
...for even thinking about doing this.

1283
01:23:07,404 --> 01:23:09,990
He's right. I would've beat my greedy ass red.

1284
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,618
I would've thrown myself off the merry-go-round.

1285
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:17,164
I would've tied myself naked to a chair
and burned myself with lit cigarettes.

1286
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:21,543
Did anyone here dream
of becoming a psychiatrist?

1287
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:22,836
Just kidding, pal.

1288
01:23:23,837 --> 01:23:26,632
There's still hope for the kids inside of all of us.

1289
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:29,176
Please don't break up my uncle's company.

1290
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:33,180
I always wanted to do that.

1291
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:45,025
Well...

1292
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:47,903
...that was very touching, Deeds.

1293
01:23:49,071 --> 01:23:51,281
It appears this divestiture has been defeated.

1294
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:53,826
Unless I'm forgetting something.

1295
01:23:55,285 --> 01:23:56,912
"My 300 million votes..."

1296
01:23:56,995 --> 01:24:00,916
...plus the five million votes I control
as proxy for the foreign investors.

1297
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:03,168
"So which way should I vote my 51 percent?"

1298
01:24:04,837 --> 01:24:06,088
I vote aye.

1299
01:24:06,672 --> 01:24:08,882
305 million times.

1300
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:14,012
The ayes have it. And Blake Media is no more.

1301
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:15,889
Not so fast, Chuck.

1302
01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:20,519
Too bad for you, when I was a kid,
I wanted to be a good reporter.

1303
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:23,355
Miss Bennett,
I wasn't aware you were a stockholder.

1304
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:25,566
There's a couple things you're not aware of.

1305
01:24:25,649 --> 01:24:28,193
How to tweeze your eyebrows, for instance.

1306
01:24:28,694 --> 01:24:33,240
Also, when Deeds gave away his fortune,
he gave away something that wasn't his.

1307
01:24:34,658 --> 01:24:39,121
- What are you talking about?
- I have here the diary of Preston Blake.

1308
01:24:41,999 --> 01:24:43,458
I stole it and read it.

1309
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,795
Please don't be mad at me.
I did it for good reasons, I promise.

1310
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:50,132
I would like to read a passage
from Mr. Blake's diary...

1311
01:24:50,424 --> 01:24:52,968
"...dated April 12, 1957."

1312
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:56,263
"I am a volcano of lust.

1313
01:24:56,388 --> 01:25:00,142
"I've gotten this far in business
"by following my heart.

1314
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:02,352
"And I must follow it now...

1315
01:25:02,936 --> 01:25:04,229
"...in love.

1316
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:09,443
"If she just gives me a sign, an opening."

1317
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:12,654
Want me to wipe the leaves
on your ficus tree, Mr. Blake?

1318
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:15,991
You can call me Preston.

1319
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:21,747
Want me to wipe the leaves
on your ficus tree, Preston?

1320
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:24,458
Yes.

1321
01:25:26,585 --> 01:25:27,586
Yes.

1322
01:25:28,504 --> 01:25:29,463
Yes!

1323
01:25:30,672 --> 01:25:32,591
Who was this mystery woman?

1324
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:37,471
I have here the Blake Media ledger
sign-in book from April, 1957.

1325
01:25:38,138 --> 01:25:43,185
On the night of the 12th, there was
only one woman working on Blake's floor.

1326
01:25:43,644 --> 01:25:48,106
Sadly, nine months later, she died,
giving birth to a son.

1327
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:50,150
A son born...

1328
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:53,362
...January 23, 1958.

1329
01:25:54,112 --> 01:25:55,489
That is my birthday.

1330
01:25:55,823 --> 01:25:57,991
To Miss Consuela Lopez.

1331
01:25:58,534 --> 01:25:59,993
That is my mother.

1332
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,871
And the rightful heir to $40 billionl

1333
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:04,832
That is my money?

1334
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,501
A simple DNA test will show...

1335
01:26:07,626 --> 01:26:11,672
...that Emilio Lopez is the majority stockholder
to Blake Media.

1336
01:26:11,922 --> 01:26:14,049
- It is my money!
- That's your money!

1337
01:26:14,216 --> 01:26:15,759
That is my money!

1338
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:18,762
Way to go, Emilio!

1339
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:21,431
I will do good things for everyone.

1340
01:26:21,932 --> 01:26:24,184
Free flamenco lessons for all.

1341
01:26:24,268 --> 01:26:26,353
People, people! Please!

1342
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,023
- That is my money.
- Don't be misled. These are all lies.

1343
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:31,692
Mr. Cedar...

1344
01:26:32,484 --> 01:26:33,652
...you are fired.

1345
01:26:34,111 --> 01:26:35,863
You can't fire me!

1346
01:26:36,405 --> 01:26:37,906
I'm in control!

1347
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,033
Get your hands off me! I'm Chuck Cedar!

1348
01:26:40,659 --> 01:26:42,411
At the lake, when you saved my life...

1349
01:26:42,494 --> 01:26:45,164
...which I never got a chance
to properly thank you for...

1350
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:47,749
- You're welcome.
- You said you didn't know who I was.

1351
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:50,335
And it made me realize I don't know who I am.

1352
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:53,755
So I started working on it
and here's what I got so far.

1353
01:26:54,256 --> 01:26:57,718
My name is Babe Bennett.
I grew up in Syossett, Long Island.

1354
01:26:57,885 --> 01:27:01,847
I have brown eyes and I don't know
what my natural hair color is anymore.

1355
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:05,392
When I was in 5th grade,
I got a crush on Walter Cronkite.

1356
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:09,062
And I really did have that Holly Hobby notebook
I was telling you about.

1357
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:13,233
I love Bruce Springsteen, Almond Roca
and Abbott and Costello movies.

1358
01:27:13,442 --> 01:27:15,527
I don't like licorice or my ankles.

1359
01:27:16,111 --> 01:27:19,239
More importantly,
I know that I messed up real bad.

1360
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:22,117
And I'd be willing to spend the rest of my life...

1361
01:27:22,493 --> 01:27:24,786
...begging you to give me another chance...

1362
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:27,289
...because I am so deeply in love with you...

1363
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:31,793
...and I know it's definitely
that forever kind of love...

1364
01:27:31,877 --> 01:27:33,212
You're crazy.

1365
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:37,132
You have beautiful ankles.

1366
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:49,144
Let's go home.

1367
01:27:51,647 --> 01:27:54,358
You're firedl Youl Youl

1368
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:57,152
Oh, you, sir. You are definitely fired.

1369
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:02,783
I'd like to stay. I think I can really do
some good if I just got another chance.

1370
01:28:06,495 --> 01:28:10,499
Not fired. But tomorrow morning,
you let me change your socks.

1371
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:13,126
Okay.

1372
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:17,548
And you, Long-Long-Longfellow...

1373
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:21,218
...you are the one who made all this possible...

1374
01:28:21,301 --> 01:28:24,304
...with your beautiful words
and your beautiful spirit.

1375
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:27,432
And Miss Bennett, with her beautiful research.

1376
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:29,393
How can I thank you?

1377
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:32,980
All I want is your friendship, Emilio.
You're a good man.

1378
01:28:34,189 --> 01:28:35,399
I'll miss you.

1379
01:28:36,859 --> 01:28:37,818
Deeds!

1380
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:41,989
- How about $1 billion?
- All right.

1381
01:28:42,531 --> 01:28:43,407
Done.

1382
01:28:56,295 --> 01:28:57,337
Holy Jeezl

1383
01:28:58,172 --> 01:28:59,631
I can't believe it!

1384
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:02,593
- What's that?
- A letter from Hallmark.

1385
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:05,179
They're actually going to buy one of my cards.

1386
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:09,349
- My gosh! Which one?
- The one I wrote for you, remember it?

1387
01:29:09,975 --> 01:29:11,393
Do I remember?

1388
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:14,897
"Hard to breathe, feels like floating

1389
01:29:15,397 --> 01:29:18,025
"So full of love my heart's exploding

1390
01:29:18,275 --> 01:29:21,320
"Mouth is dry, hands are shaking

1391
01:29:21,737 --> 01:29:24,031
"My heart is yours for the taking

1392
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:26,783
"Acting weird, not myself

1393
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:29,870
"Dancing around like the Keebler elf

1394
01:29:30,162 --> 01:29:33,207
"Finally time for this poor schlub

1395
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:37,878
"to know how it feels to fall in lub"

1396
01:29:38,504 --> 01:29:39,797
I'm so proud of you!

1397
01:29:45,886 --> 01:29:48,639
Can you believe Deeds bought us all these?

1398
01:29:53,227 --> 01:29:55,062
Damn, these things are fast!

1399
01:29:59,441 --> 01:30:00,734
I'm okay!

1400
01:30:01,777 --> 01:30:02,653
I'm okay!
