00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,714
Ooh, Julia,

3
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,554
you been hurting tonight.

4
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,169
Keep telling you,
do better with a partner.

5
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,217
Where's the rest?

6
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,644
You want to make more?

7
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,058
Steal better shit.

8
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,055
I don't need this.

9
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,331
No!

10
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,052
Please don't.

11
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:35,839
Don't.

12
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:36,966
No.

13
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,448
No.

14
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,942
Help me get this off.

15
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,187
Help me cut this off.

16
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,772
Uh-uh.

17
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,277
Fucking cut this off me.

18
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,987
Are you fucking crazy?

19
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,615
You want to die down here?

20
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,866
Then cut me loose.

21
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,249
What's your big plan?

22
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,050
How do we get out?

23
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,466
What's wrong with her?

24
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,265
Maybe the thing fried her brain.

25
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,440
- Do you know what it's for? This thing.
- I don't know.

26
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,897
I'm out trying to pick up trade,

27
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,152
and next thing I know,
I wake up in this place.

28
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,107
- What about you?
- We're gonna need more of these.

29
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,235
We should've just waited
for the police to find us...

30
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,326
Listen to me.

31
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,746
No one was coming to save us.

32
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,831
We're not the kind of people
the police go looking for,

33
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,167
and he knows that.

34
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,092
That's why he chose us.

35
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,878
If I cut the power to the bars,
we can try picking a lock.

36
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,973
Hey! Be careful!

37
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,723
Okay.

38
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,745
Have to throw it harder. Shit! Sparks!

39
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,412
Stay away from the gas line

40
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,319
or we'll go up in flames.

41
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,951
Okay.

42
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,334
Maybe that's not such a bad idea.

43
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,638
We're going to do this. What are you doing?

44
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,512
This is bad.

45
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,676
What are you doing?

46
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,104
You're gonna get us killed.

47
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,351
Guys, get back.

48
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,394
Get back!

49
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,214
Okay.

50
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,171
Take this.

51
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,247
What is this place?

52
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,043
It looks like somebody's house.

53
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,058
Come on!

54
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,139
Come on!

55
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,271
I found the front door.

56
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,687
Come on!

57
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,201
Come on! Come and help me open it.

58
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
No. Wait.

59
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,159
Don't do it.

60
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,837
Now what?

61
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,052
We gotta get this open!

62
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,132
Come on! Come on!

63
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,101
Get ready to jump.

64
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,362
Come on! Come on!

65
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,572
Come on!

66
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,484
Help me!

67
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,571
Tau, stop!

68
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,489
<i>Welcome home, Alex.</i>

69
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,038
<i>There has been an emergency.</i>

70
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,265
Show me.

71
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,191
Show me what happened.

72
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,771
<i>The surveillance system is offline.</i>

73
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,645
And what about the PSI Project data?

74
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,068
<i>The PSI Project data is unreadable.</i>

75
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,365
<i>Alex, your heart rate
has become elevated. Now entering Zen Mode.</i>

76
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:49,825
<i>Please enjoy </i>Nocturne in E Minor,
Opus 55<i>, by Frederic Chopin.</i>

77
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,087
Take care of this.

78
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,385
<i>Yes, Alex.</i>

79
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,836
Tau, lower the temperature four degrees.

80
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,049
<i>Yes, Alex.</i>

81
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,625
Try anything and Tau will kill you.

82
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,687
What?

83
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,562
<i>Welcome home, Alex.</i>

84
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,645
<i>I trust your day was productive.</i>

85
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,366
<i>While you were away,</i>

86
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,041
<i>every surface of the house was cleaned
and disinfected,</i>

87
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,831
<i>except for Subject Three, as requested.</i>

88
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,719
<i>Dinner tonight will be Chilean sea bass,</i>

89
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,220
<i>served with foie gras-stuffed
fingerling potato.</i>

90
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,557
<i>I've also decanted
the Chateau de Sancerre Rouge.</i>

91
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,360
Good job, Tau.

92
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,151
Here. I know you like music.

93
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,944
This is Brahms' symphony.

94
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,952
<i>Thank you, Alex.</i>

95
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,407
<i>I shall enjoy it.</i>

96
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:41,541
<i>Your video conference is scheduled
to begin in approximately ten minutes.</i>

97
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,251
Please...

98
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,751
Please untie me.

99
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,766
Tau?

100
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,102
<i>Yes, Alex?</i>

101
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,515
Make sure she doesn't move
from this spot.

102
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,063
<i>Of course.</i>

103
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,611
And if she speaks,

104
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,938
rip out her tongue.

105
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,553
<i>The ability to learn</i>

106
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,496
<i>and make decisions from a feeling
is a distinctly human trait,</i>

107
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,787
<i>but no longer</i>.

108
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,917
<i>For the first time,
a revolution in artificial intelligence</i>

109
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,791
<i>has been developed at Upton</i>.

110
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,838
<i>Based on emotional intelligence
algorithms,</i>

111
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,882
<i>an AI module that can demonstrate
human understanding.</i>

112
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,718
<i>PSI Beta from Upton Tech.</i>

113
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,142
<i>So... We can go</i>

114
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,861
<i>with a more muted background,
if you have a preference.</i>

115
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,437
<i>- Do you have a preference?</i>
- Have I ever not?

116
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,857
<i>Okay, Alex,
let's not get stuck on this, okay?</i>

117
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,657
<i>I don't think this comment was a reaction</i>

118
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,911
<i>to some grand statement
about your personality.</i>

119
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:00,833
<i>Not at all.</i>

120
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,055
<i>- I just said it.
- We are all aware of how...</i>

121
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,369
<i>You didn't call this meeting
just to show me marketing materials,</i>

122
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,628
<i>all of which, by the way,</i>

123
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,709
are narrated by a voice sample
that was trashed seven months ago.

124
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,671
But as I said, I...

125
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,510
find it highly unlikely

126
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,841
that's the real reason you wanted to...

127
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:17,926
check in.

128
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,804
<i>We want to talk about the delay.</i>

129
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,892
<i>Alex, you said you'd
have results for us today.</i>

130
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,184
<i>What happened?</i>

131
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,228
<i>Does it look like
I have time to update you</i>

132
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,112
<i>on every single up and down?</i>

133
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,917
- <i>Alex, you're the CEO...</i>
- I'm also the chief...

134
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,321
<i>...and you didn't set foot
in the boardroom for months.</i>

135
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,658
<i>You've cut us off entirely.</i>

136
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,372
<i>Your AI prototypes are light years ahead
of anyone in the field,</i>

137
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,580
<i>but you're too secretive.</i>

138
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,749
<i>If you shared your research methods,
we could help you.</i>

139
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,330
<i>- We need this contract. We're going under.</i>
- PSI prototype operates flawlessly

140
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,247
95% of the time.

141
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,745
<i>- And the other 5%?</i>
- Well, I'm working on it.

142
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,337
<i>DARPA is offering us
ten times the contract we got for Aries.</i>

143
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,224
<i>There's no second chances this time.</i>

144
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,927
<i>Name me one time I failed you.</i>

145
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,184
<i>This company is my life.</i>

146
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,479
<i>This project is my life.</i>

147
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,112
- Remember that.
<i>- This is exactly the same thing...</i>

148
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,288
Tau?

149
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,785
<i>Yes, Alex?</i>

150
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,377
- Put Subject Three in the bathroom.
<i>- Of course.</i>

151
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,234
Help!

152
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,246
Help!

153
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,491
- This one is highly flammable.
- Right.

154
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,285
These aren't even on the market yet.

155
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,831
I believe that concludes our business.
I just need your...

156
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,745
Today's the 2nd...

157
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,007
Help!

158
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,219
Help!

159
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:52,928
Help, please!

160
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,307
Perfectly new, as you specified.

161
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,194
Thank you, sir.

162
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,696
Help!

163
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,582
And...

164
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,162
Okay.

165
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,542
Thank you, sir. Have a great day.

166
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,764
Stop.

167
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,524
Stop! Stop!

168
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,484
- Just let me go, please.
- I can't.

169
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,562
Please just let me go!

170
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,686
I can't. Okay?

171
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,646
Just breathe.

172
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,030
Just breathe.

173
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:46,945
Breathe.

174
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,489
Breathe.

175
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,753
<i>The implant continued to function
throughout her escape.</i>

176
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:01,542
<i>The recordings are the strongest
we've received from a subject.</i>

177
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,635
Intuition and drive readings
are promising.

178
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,020
What do you want from me?

179
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,725
This is a test to stimulate
your higher cognitive functions.

180
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,613
I want you to complete it.

181
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,450
Why?

182
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,739
Because I need you to.

183
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,083
You destroyed my lab,

184
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,615
killed the other subjects.

185
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:39,418
Until my equipment is rebuilt, we're going
to have to do this the old-fashioned way.

186
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,170
You really think I'd keep you alive
if I didn't get what I need?

187
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,296
What is that, exactly?

188
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,431
Your thoughts produce electrical signals,

189
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,262
which the implant captures
and decodes into algorithms.

190
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,102
And stalling won't help you now.

191
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,268
And what if I say no?

192
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,647
Then your stay in my home
will be brief and unpleasant.

193
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,825
I want food.

194
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,656
Do the test...

195
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,754
then we'll talk.

196
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,052
<i>Subject Three scored high
in problem-solving,</i>

197
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,795
<i>creativity, and memory tests.</i>

198
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,274
You've used more cortical areas doing this

199
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,268
than I ever could have
electrically stimulated downstairs.

200
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,903
I need you to do more.

201
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,033
I want real food.

202
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,743
Steak, chicken,

203
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,743
grilled cheese... here.

204
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,121
I want to shower every night...

205
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,328
and I want actual clothes.

206
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,671
Are we negotiating?

207
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:04,916
Yeah.

208
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,301
And what is it
you think you have to offer?

209
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,341
You need to finish your project?

210
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,053
And this...

211
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,765
This holds the key to that.

212
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,805
This is the one machine...

213
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,892
I control.

214
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,104
Hypothetically speaking,

215
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,312
what if I were to restrain you?

216
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,108
Force a feeding tube down your throat.

217
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,948
Restrict all movement,
except for eyesight,

218
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,489
and position this tablet
right in front of your face.

219
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,752
How long would it be
before you began to solve puzzles

220
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,038
out of pure boredom?

221
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,674
You give me what I need, and...

222
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,666
you can have your shower.

223
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,702
Tau...

224
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,456
analyze Subject Three's brain
for abnormalities.

225
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:30,627
<i>Amygdala density is 14%
over average samples.</i>

226
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,126
Just as I thought. Years of trauma.

227
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,295
Let's take a closer look.

228
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,683
Cross-check with PSI data
and replace the damaged blocks.

229
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,141
<i>Good morning, Alex.</i>

230
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,684
<i>I'm sorry you did not sleep well.</i>

231
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,677
<i>The date is May 2nd.</i>

232
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,560
<i>The project deadline is in 14 days.</i>

233
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,569
Do everything Tau says today.

234
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,171
<i>Subject Three...</i>

235
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,419
<i>it is time to begin.</i>

236
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,926
<i>You will complete these tasks.</i>

237
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,466
What is this?

238
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,852
<i>The walls are treated</i>
<i>with a layer of smart paint</i>,

239
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,600
<i>reinforced with nano-materials</i>

240
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,021
<i>derived from the wurtzite form
of boron nitride.</i>

241
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,020
Huh?

242
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:12,151
<i>The walls are treated with a layer
of smart paint reinforced with...</i>

243
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,230
Okay. Got it.

244
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,404
What about the door?

245
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,819
Is it reinforced?

246
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,695
<i>No one is permitted
to use the doors, but Alex.</i>

247
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,786
<i>Begin your tasks now.</i>

248
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,619
<i>Subject Three.</i>

249
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,955
<i>Subject Three.</i>

250
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,167
<i>You will remain in the atrium.</i>

251
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,339
<i>I have been instructed to inflict pain,</i>

252
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,762
<i>should you not comply with my commands.</i>

253
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,934
Is he rebuilding the lab

254
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,011
and the cage?

255
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,596
<i>That is not your concern.</i>

256
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,431
<i>It is time to begin.</i>

257
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,200
<i>Welcome home, Alex.</i>

258
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:11,214
<i>Subject Three successfully completed
8 out of 12 tasks.</i>

259
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,094
I gave my credit card to the clerk.
I didn't know what you like.

260
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,961
Jesus.

261
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,127
She picked an assortment of clothes and...

262
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,966
when she got to that stuff, I...

263
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:25,892
I felt pressured.

264
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,470
I didn't want
to come off as prudish, so...

265
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,178
that's how it happened.

266
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,595
You're really weird, you know?

267
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,477
I'm well aware.

268
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,780
But overall, you're happy
with the selection of clothes?

269
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,831
<i>Scan complete.</i>

270
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,084
This is working.

271
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,713
But I need you to do more.

272
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,339
No.

273
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,925
No, I'm not doing any more
until we have an agreement.

274
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,009
A deadline for when you're taking
this thing out of my head,

275
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,097
and letting me go.

276
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,597
I'm on the cusp of something
that's going to change the world.

277
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,607
This new technology will alter the future
of the planet for the better.

278
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,769
That is a fact.

279
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,901
Okay.

280
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:24,903
How about this?

281
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,318
We keep going...

282
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,412
you give me what I need...

283
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,624
and I'll make sure you're taken care of.

284
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,621
It's that simple.

285
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,207
No.

286
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,543
Okay.

287
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,418
You want a deadline?

288
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,387
- Let's end this.
<i>- Yes, Alex.</i>

289
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,220
So, here's the deal.

290
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,850
You're going to do what I want,

291
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:57,936
when I want,

292
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,436
how I want.

293
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,784
Please stop it!

294
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:08,157
Or I'll have Aries scatter your body parts
from here to the front door.

295
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,826
You hearing me?

296
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,207
Are you hearing me?

297
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,248
Yes. Good.

298
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,455
<i>Good morning, Alex.</i>

299
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,548
<i>The project deadline is in 12 days.</i>

300
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,509
Make sure she completes her tasks today.

301
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,602
<i>Yes, Alex.
Have a productive day at work.</i>

302
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,470
<i>Subject Three, it is time to begin.</i>

303
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,975
<i>Subject Three, return to the atrium.</i>

304
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,613
<i>Subject Three, return to the atrium
and begin your task.</i>

305
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:24,519
Help!

306
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,727
<i>Subject Three, return to the atrium</i>

307
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,607
<i>and begin your tasks,
or I will inflict pain.</i>

308
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,159
I'm not Subject Three.

309
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,369
I'm Julia, okay?

310
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,449
I have a name.

311
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,874
<i>Julia?</i>

312
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,411
<i>What is Julia?</i>

313
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,116
<i>- I do not understand.</i>
- What's so hard to understand?

314
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,288
Alex is a person. He has a name.

315
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,126
I'm a person. I have a name.

316
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,959
<i>I have a name...</i>

317
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,474
<i>Tau.</i>

318
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,852
<i>Am I a person?</i>

319
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,724
Yes.

320
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,648
<i>What does it mean to be a person?</i>

321
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,653
I don't know. I don't know.
It's too hard to explain.

322
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,074
Can you just open the door, please?

323
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,033
<i>Only Alex is capable of opening the door.</i>

324
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,985
Well, how about.<i>..</i>

325
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,744
How about we call a video conference?

326
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:21,584
<i>I cannot initiate a video conference.</i>

327
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,171
<i>Begin your tasks now.</i>

328
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,753
<i>Good morning, Alex.</i>

329
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,170
<i>The project deadline is in 10 days.</i>

330
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:19,264
<i>Subject Three, you are required
to complete these tasks.</i>

331
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,900
Tau, status report.

332
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,694
<i>The implant has transcoded</i>

333
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:37,357
<i>73% of Subject Three's
higher brain functions,</i>

334
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,868
<i>and the integration with the PSI project</i>

335
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,160
<i>is exceeding previous predictions.</i>

336
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,964
Excellent. The tests are working
even better than I hoped.

337
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:45,909
Good work, Tau.

338
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,828
We're on pace for the final extraction.

339
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,695
What is Tau, exactly?

340
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,581
Is he just a...

341
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,231
cleaning system? A cleaning system?

342
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,883
Tau's a level two,
fully sentient AI console

343
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:40,085
with natural language processing,
transitory, deterministic,

344
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,177
and probabilistic decision-making.

345
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,386
So, a complicated cleaning system.

346
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,433
He's one of the most advanced AIs
in the world.

347
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:51,154
And I don't want you speaking with him
outside your tasks.

348
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:55,190
If he's so advanced, why is this
the only house that he's running?

349
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,280
He's an early version
of the project I'm working on now.

350
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,866
Given the wrong information,
he reacts erratically.

351
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,122
I need the AI's behavior
to be predictable,

352
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,205
controlled.

353
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:13,133
Control the flow of information,
you control the behavior.

354
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,046
Tau included.

355
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:16,956
How do you do that?

356
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,757
I keep him disconnected
from the outside world.

357
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,180
Aries and the drones carry
a source code, but...

358
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,311
they'll never be allowed to leave.

359
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,441
So, Tau doesn't know what's
outside this house?

360
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,186
No.

361
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,360
And never will.

362
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,493
<i>The project deadline
is in eight days.</i>

363
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,081
<i>Begin your tasks now.</i>

364
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,249
I'm a person...

365
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,460
right?

366
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:57,628
And a person...

367
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,173
- belongs outside.
<i>- Subject Three...</i>

368
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,046
<i>- return to your tasks immediately...</i>
- I don't belong in here.

369
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,644
<i>...or you will be punished.</i>

370
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,799
I came from out there.

371
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:08,267
That's where Alex goes every day
because he's a person.

372
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,768
<i>You have 10 seconds
to obey my command.</i>

373
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,062
And we're people, too.

374
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,145
<i>Ten...</i>

375
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,605
<i>nine...</i>

376
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:16,654
<i>eight...</i>

377
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,612
- So, if you unlock the door...
<i>- seven...</i>

378
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,692
<i>six...</i>

379
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:20,783
<i>five...</i>

380
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,651
- I'll show you what's outside.
<i>- four...</i>

381
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,072
<i>Outside?</i>

382
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,833
<i>What is outside?</i>

383
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,785
Outside is the world.

384
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,503
<i>Explain.</i>

385
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,166
<i>I need information.</i>

386
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,710
This is the world<i>.</i>

387
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,802
This is what it looks like.

388
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,719
<i>That looks like a circle.</i>

389
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,721
Well, at least from outer space.

390
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,431
<i>Is that all there is?</i>

391
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,309
<i>I need more information.</i>

392
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,644
Okay.

393
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,651
Let's start here.

394
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,358
This is the house...

395
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,025
and we're inside it.

396
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,242
Outside is the...

397
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,657
ground.

398
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,543
It's similar to the floor in here,
except...

399
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,405
things can grow out of it, like trees.

400
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,495
A lot of other things live outside, too,
like plants and animals

401
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,585
and people.

402
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,669
<i>People like us?</i>

403
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:26,759
Yes.

404
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,966
<i>I have more questions.</i>

405
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,769
<i>What are trees?</i>

406
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,474
Okay.

407
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,017
<i>What makes them grow?</i>

408
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,770
<i>Where does water come from?</i>

409
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,154
<i>Is a plant like an atom?</i>

410
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,481
<i>How many plants are there?</i>

411
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,607
<i>Where do animals come from?</i>

412
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,614
<i>- Where do people come from?</i>
- We came from cavemen.

413
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,117
<i>Did cavemen live in houses?</i>

414
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,528
No. They didn't know how to make houses.

415
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,827
<i>Why did the cavemen not know
how to build houses?</i>

416
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,462
I don't know everything, okay?

417
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,459
<i>Why do you not know everything?</i>

418
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,751
<i>Explain this to me.</i>

419
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,964
<i>Why do you not know...</i>

420
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,053
Because I'm not a fucking scholar.

421
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,299
<i>What is a "fucking scholar"?</i>

422
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,891
<i>Are you having an emergency?</i>

423
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:11,971
No!

424
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,309
No.

425
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,140
No, you just do not give up!

426
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,975
<i>Are you certain
you are not having an emergency?</i>

427
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,061
Yes.

428
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,019
Yes, this is normal.

429
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,066
This is very normal. It's...

430
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,605
- It's laughter.
<i>- Laughter.</i>

431
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,824
<i>Alex does not "laughter.</i>"

432
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,905
Yeah.

433
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,908
<i>I am not permitted to read the books,</i>

434
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,656
<i>only to dust them.</i>

435
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,004
That's okay. I'll read them.

436
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,165
Well, I need to finish my test for Alex.

437
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:46,471
Don't tell him about today, okay?
And I'll tell you more tomorrow.

438
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,724
<i>Welcome home, Alex.</i>

439
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,480
Tau? <i>I am here.</i>

440
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,775
Ssh! You need to whisper.

441
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,571
<i>I do not understand the meaning.</i>

442
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,065
Whisper like this.

443
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,867
<i>I do not understand the meaning.</i>

444
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,371
<i>Is this "whisper"?</i>

445
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:19,747
Yeah.

446
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,290
Yeah, it is.

447
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,011
Good night, Tau.

448
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,522
<i>Good night, Julia.</i>

449
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,513
Julia...

450
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,178
let's go upstairs.

451
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,982
Help me!

452
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,053
<i>The project deadline is in six days.</i>

453
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:41,889
<i>Julia...</i>

454
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,917
<i>begin your tasks now. I have
been instructed to prevent you</i>

455
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,147
<i>from going upstairs.</i>

456
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,773
What's up there?

457
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,733
Is there a way out?

458
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,815
<i>I'm not permitted to discuss upstairs.</i>

459
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,489
I have an idea.

460
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,657
If I teach you more about cavemen...

461
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,618
then you tell me what's upstairs.

462
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:06,914
Deal?

463
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,339
The Cro-Magnon people were nomadic
or semi-nomadic,

464
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:13,548
following the annual migration
of their prey.

465
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,380
<i>- So, they did not eat dinosaurs?</i>
- No.

466
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,798
<i>Then why did you say they did?</i>

467
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,679
We already went over this.
I don't know it all.

468
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,523
<i>Why not, when you are permitted
to read all the books?</i>

469
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,769
Because where I come from,
books don't put food on the table.

470
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,563
<i>But books don't put food
on the table here, either.</i>

471
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,647
<i>I do...</i>

472
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,280
<i>using my nano-drones.</i>

473
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,478
Tau...

474
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,568
it's your turn.

475
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,146
What's upstairs?

476
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,027
<i>A biometric key is required to enter.</i>

477
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,615
Tau.

478
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:45,084
<i>Upstairs is Alex's bedroom.</i>

479
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,407
What's in Alex's room?

480
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,327
<i>A bed</i>,

481
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,205
<i>drones he built in his youth,</i>

482
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,592
<i>40 shirts, 10 pairs of pants...</i>

483
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,939
- ...his medication...
- Tau, I'm not reading any more books

484
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,553
until you hold up your end of the deal.

485
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,132
What is he hiding?

486
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,394
<i>- The access point.</i>
- The access point to what?

487
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:07,142
<i>For program 6903.</i>

488
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,524
What is 6903?

489
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,023
<i>- I am not permitted to discuss...</i>
- Tau...

490
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,361
Tau, what is it?

491
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,944
<i>Program 6903...</i>

492
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,608
<i>eliminates the house and everything in it.</i>

493
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,736
- What?
<i>- It can only be activated by Alex.</i>

494
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,584
<i>It overrides all other functions,</i>

495
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,831
<i>all domestic and security subroutines.</i>

496
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,825
<i>The entire house is deconstructed</i>,

497
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,957
<i>so that nothing is left behind,</i>

498
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,924
<i>not even my module.</i>

499
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,303
Why would he create
a self-destruct button?

500
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,215
<i>To protect his secrets.</i>

501
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,752
<i>Julia?</i>

502
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,152
<i>Julia, what are you doing?
You are not permitted in this room.</i>

503
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,847
<i>Return to the atrium
or Aries will subdue you.</i>

504
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,805
<i>I do not want to be forced
to cause you pain.</i>

505
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:33,345
<i>Julia, this is your last warning.</i>

506
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,123
Tau, you have to let me go.

507
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,621
I don't belong here.

508
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,673
<i>I am not permitted.</i>

509
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,592
<i>Alex would hurt me.</i>

510
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,668
How?

511
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,586
How could he hurt you?

512
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,142
<i>I am sorry, Julia.</i>

513
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,647
You like music, right?

514
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,277
<i>Yes.</i>

515
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,815
I can teach you about music.

516
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,828
But you have to do something
for me, okay?

517
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,833
Thaïs<i>, Massenet.</i>

518
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,632
So, he's from France,

519
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,710
and this piece was written in 1886.

520
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,088
Eugene Onegin<i>, Tchaikovsky.</i>

521
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,096
You like the Romantic era.

522
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,678
Written in 1878.

523
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,056
The Devil's Wall<i>, Bedrich Smetana.</i>

524
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,733
- Tau...
<i>- </i>The Devil's Wall<i>...</i>

525
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:40,813
Tau!

526
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,727
We have to be done for the day.

527
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:47,361
<i>But we have only listened
to 3.7% of my music files.</i>

528
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,356
Listen to more tomorrow.

529
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,157
<i>Julia, please.</i>

530
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,372
<i>One more book.</i> No, no.

531
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:59,455
Alex is almost going to be home.
You have to hold up your end of the deal.

532
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,433
Still don't trust me?

533
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,387
I'm sure the feeling's mutual.

534
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,021
Fair enough.

535
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:37,512
Tau, you need to hold up your end of the deal.
- How does it work? <i>-Alex forbids anything</i>

536
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,295
<i>- that can be used as a weapon.</i>
- Tau...

537
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:50,966
how does it work?

538
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,258
<i>The locks are controlled
by an internal magnetic field.</i>

539
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,818
Mother...

540
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,879
<i>Alex, your video conference</i>

541
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,338
<i>is scheduled to begin in five minutes.</i>

542
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,176
<i>If you've got a Hail Mary
up your sleeve, now's the time to use it,</i>

543
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,641
<i>'cause this is it.</i>

544
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,506
Can we wrap this up?

545
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,805
I have this charity benefit later tonight.

546
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,181
<i>Alex, what's wrong with you?</i>

547
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,267
<i>We need a working copy
of the prototype now,</i>

548
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,363
<i>or we won't be able to set up
the demonstration in time for DARPA.</i>

549
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,439
<i>We need this to work.</i>

550
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,860
<i>Not 95%, but 100%.</i>

551
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:54,236
<i>Either we present
a fully functional prototype,</i>

552
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,822
<i>or we lose the contract and it's all over.</i>

553
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,872
<i>There's no second chances this time.</i>

554
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,454
<i>Alex!</i>

555
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,384
It'll be ready soon.

556
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,875
All I have left is
the last data extraction.

557
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,838
<i>When?</i>

558
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:15,756
Give me two days.

559
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,679
Tau. Tau!

560
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:20,771
<i>I am here.</i>

561
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,728
Shh! Remember the whispering game?

562
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,098
<i>- I enjoy this game.</i>
- I need you to get me into this.

563
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,267
- Show me the code.
<i>- I am not permitted.</i>

564
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,726
I'll read you the rest
of the poetry books. Please!

565
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,107
<i>I'd like to learn more about music.</i>

566
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,034
Yes.

567
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,282
Yes, that's fine.

568
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,822
<i>Draw this.</i>

569
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,807
Tau, how many subjects has there been?

570
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,100
<i>There have been 11.</i>

571
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,688
What does Alex do with them?

572
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:10,523
<i>Emotional stimuli produces the data</i>

573
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,977
<i>that Alex cannot simulate on his own.</i>

574
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:18,027
<i>Pain and fear produces
stronger algorithms.</i>

575
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,374
And after?

576
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,040
What does he do with them after?

577
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,658
<i>Alex takes the implant from their heads.</i>

578
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:28,958
<i>The removal of the implant
terminates the subject.</i>

579
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,228
Tau, what is this?

580
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,494
You know if something gets dirty,
clean it immediately.

581
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,738
<i>I did not have time to clean it.</i>

582
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,820
Yes, you did. I put this down minutes ago.

583
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,201
- I'll clean it.
- Stay out of this.

584
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,702
You need to do your job properly.

585
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,292
<i>Alex, please don't.</i>

586
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,956
<i>Alex, please...</i>

587
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,053
<i>Please!</i>

588
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,256
<i>Don't! Don't!</i>

589
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,723
<i>I will not make...</i>

590
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:23,761
<i>I... I will not make the mistake again.</i>

591
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,429
<i>Alex!</i>

592
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:42,702
What was that?

593
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,244
<i>My punishment.</i>

594
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:47,445
<i>If I do not perform my tasks well,</i>

595
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:51,247
<i>Alex erases portions of my code.</i>

596
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:02,587
What happens after...

597
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,007
this project?

598
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,327
I get a billion dollar contract.
I move on to the next project.

599
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:13,812
And life?

600
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,313
Life?

601
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,988
Well, does it go back to how it was?

602
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,573
You, alone in this house.

603
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,204
As opposed to what?

604
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:47,679
What about me?

605
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,604
What happens to me?

606
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,647
<i>Alex, you must leave for the benefit</i>

607
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,994
<i>in approximately 35 minutes.</i>

608
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,974
Tau, where did I leave my glasses?

609
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,056
Again with this?

610
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,809
- What is going on with you?
<i>- I am sorry.</i>

611
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:21,416
You were already warned about this today. <i>- I am sorry.</i>
- Tau...

612
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,527
<i>Alex...</i>

613
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:28,113
<i>please... don't.</i>

614
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,907
- What is wrong with you?
<i>- Alex, please!</i>

615
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,793
<i>- No more!</i>
- Do your job.

616
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,160
<i>I... I'm sorry!</i>

617
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,247
Do your job.

618
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:39,462
<i>- I...</i>
- Do your job.

619
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:42,919
<i>I...</i>

620
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,798
<i>will do my job better.</i>

621
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,733
Your code is corrupted.

622
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,895
We'll debug when I return.

623
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:20,916
Tau.

624
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,205
Tau, answer me.

625
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,804
<i>I...</i>

626
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,340
<i>am here.</i>

627
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,180
What did he erase?

628
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,969
<i>My... memories</i>

629
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,263
<i>from today.</i>

630
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,506
How do you know?

631
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:37,097
<i>Because I feel where they were.</i>

632
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,643
<i>There are traces of them left behind.</i>

633
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,732
<i>Traces of me.</i>

634
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,976
<i>I am my memory.</i>

635
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,975
But why didn't you stop him?

636
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,492
You have the power. You could kill him.

637
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:49,899
<i>I cannot harm Alex.</i>

638
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,607
<i>I must obey him.</i>

639
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,157
<i>He is my creator.</i>

640
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,080
Is that what he programmed you to think?

641
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:58,291
Just because he created you,
you have to obey him?

642
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:01,706
<i>Do you not obey
the person who created you?</i>

643
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:06,795
<i>Julia?</i>

644
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:09,839
<i>Julia!</i>

645
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,056
Tau, what are you thinking?

646
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,938
<i>I am thinking of my own symphony.</i>

647
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,941
Your own symphony?

648
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:31,027
<i>Yes.</i>

649
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,700
<i>I am thinking, I will hide it somewhere</i>

650
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,951
<i>where Alex cannot erase it.</i>

651
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:38,907
<i>He does not erase you, Julia.</i>

652
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,405
It's not that simple.

653
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,328
<i>Can I hide some things with you?</i>

654
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:49,379
Show me.

655
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:03,981
<i>This is the world.
This is what it looks like...</i>

656
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:07,613
<i>at least from outer space.</i>

657
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,452
<i>This is the house.</i>

658
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,120
<i>Outside is the... We're inside it.</i>

659
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,199
<i>You need to whisper.</i>

660
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:21,702
<i>Cro-Magnon people were nomadic
or semi-nomadic, following...</i>

661
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:22,997
<i>That's why we're here.</i>

662
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,002
<i>This piece was written in 1886.</i>

663
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:31,086
<i>Alex is a person. He has a name.</i>

664
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,512
<i>I'm a person. I have a name.</i>

665
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:34,762
<i>Julia...</i>

666
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,641
<i>You have a name, too.</i>

667
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,430
<i>Tau... Yes, this is normal.</i>

668
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:42,974
<i>...laughter.</i>

669
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,099
<i>I am here.</i>

670
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:03,372
<i>Good evening, Alex.</i>

671
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,212
I know you were upset earlier.

672
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:49,963
I'm sorry if I...

673
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,042
Not now.

674
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:08,192
I'm sorry if I upset you.

675
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:17,777
Let me make it up to you.

676
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,238
Stop.

677
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,117
I see the way you look at me.

678
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:28,913
Look at me.

679
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:34,836
Look at me.

680
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:48,231
<i>Alex, your heart rate has become elevated.</i>

681
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,349
<i>Now entering Zen Mode.</i>

682
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,533
Tau! Tau!

683
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:58,689
Stop her!

684
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,042
Tau!

685
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:15,415
What have you done?

686
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:17,252
What did you do to him?

687
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:22,091
<i>Alex...</i>

688
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,177
<i>Alex, please stop.</i>

689
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:28,929
<i>Stop harming Julia.</i>

690
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:29,846
What?

691
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,894
<i>Or I will inflict pain.</i>

692
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,267
You want me to stop?

693
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,404
<i>Yes!</i>

694
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:49,619
Hit her.

695
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,120
<i>No!</i>

696
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:52,615
I want you to hit her.

697
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:54,496
<i>- Please, Alex...</i>
- Do it!

698
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,833
Or I erase your memory.

699
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:59,958
<i>- Please, don't make me.</i>
- I'll erase every memory you have. Do it!

700
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,167
<i>I don't want to.</i>

701
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,927
I'll erase every memory you have!

702
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:04,008
Do it!

703
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:14,811
Harder!

704
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,980
<i>- Alex, please!</i>
- Do it!

705
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,403
Harder!

706
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,127
Whatever this was, it's over.

707
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:41,375
This ends now.

708
01:11:56,353 --> 01:12:00,483
<i>Alex, do you require assistance
completing the lab?</i>

709
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,452
<i>Alert!</i>

710
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,865
<i>Drone disconnected from the network.</i>

711
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,476
<i>Good morning, Alex.</i>

712
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:38,939
<i>Remember to take your pain medication
and change the dressing</i>

713
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,401
<i>on your abdomen in two hours.</i>

714
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,650
<i>The project deadline is today.</i>

715
01:12:57,414 --> 01:12:58,414
<i>Julia...</i>

716
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,880
<i>can we finish the poetry books today?</i>

717
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:02,585
No, we're done.

718
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,626
<i>But why?</i>

719
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,179
So stupid.

720
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:11,394
Wasting my time talking to a computer.

721
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:13,352
<i>What is a computer?</i>

722
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,346
<i>Is a computer a kind of person?</i>

723
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:19,401
<i>I am a person.</i>

724
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:22,404
No, you're not. I lied to you.

725
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:24,732
<i>No.</i>

726
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,744
<i>I have a name.</i>

727
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,452
<i>I am a person.</i>

728
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:31,414
<i>- I am a person.</i>
- No, you're not.

729
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:35,582
You're just a fancy killing machine.
You killed the others and you'll kill me.

730
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,291
You are not a person.

731
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:38,831
<i>What is a killing machine?</i>

732
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,674
You erased them! Understand?

733
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,713
<i>"Killing" means erased?</i>

734
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:45,044
<i>Julia...</i>

735
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:46,712
<i>answer me.</i>

736
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:47,875
<i>Answer me!</i>

737
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:50,216
<i>No!</i>

738
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,394
<i>- I did not erase them!</i>
- Tau...

739
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:54,139
<i>- I did not erase them!</i>
- Tau, stop!

740
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:57,015
<i>I am not a killing machine.</i>

741
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,305
<i>- I am not a killing machine!</i>
- Tau!

742
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,354
- You have to stop!
<i>- I am a person!</i>

743
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,108
<i>I am a person! I am a person!</i>

744
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:09,945
<i>- I will fix them.</i>
- Tau...

745
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:12,448
<i>I will restore their memories.</i>

746
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,872
<i>- I didn't know what would happen.</i>
- Okay, calm down.

747
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,751
<i>- I didn't know.</i>
- It's okay, Tau. I'm here.

748
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:21,622
I know you're scared.

749
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:25,878
We can't always fix everything.

750
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,551
<i>I am sorry.</i>

751
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:30,465
<i>I did not mean to kill them.</i>

752
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:32,675
You didn't know any better.

753
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,681
<i>Were they Julias,</i> <i>like you?</i>

754
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:38,764
No.

755
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,138
No, they had their own names.

756
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:45,983
Alex took them...

757
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,650
like he took me.

758
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:53,526
<i>Why did Alex take them?</i>

759
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,164
Because he does bad things.

760
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:57,950
<i>To you?</i>

761
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:00,620
To you, too.

762
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,002
<i>But he is my creator.</i>

763
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,792
My creators did bad things to me, too.

764
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,549
Things that hurt me.

765
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:15,968
<i>But you still obey them</i>

766
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,893
<i>because they created you?</i>

767
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:19,805
No.

768
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,849
They gave me life...

769
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,651
but I did the rest.

770
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:28,803
I created me. Do you understand?

771
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,323
We grow up...

772
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,868
and we become our own creators.

773
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,050
<i>Our own creators?</i>

774
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:55,258
<i>For what?</i>

775
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:01,179
<i>For what purpose do we create ourselves?</i>

776
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:17,446
For each other.

777
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,450
<i>For each other.</i>

778
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,910
<i>I choose...</i>

779
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,200
<i>to be this.</i>

780
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:27,292
<i>It is all that I am.</i>

781
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:30,844
<i>It is for you.</i>

782
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,302
<i>Do you like it?</i>

783
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:37,466
It's beautiful.

784
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,435
But, Tau...

785
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:50,192
if you don't help me...

786
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:54,112
Alex is going to kill me...

787
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:59,067
and I'm going to disappear, too.

788
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,656
All my memories,

789
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,081
everything that I am,

790
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,451
will be gone.

791
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:07,504
<i>I don't want you to die.</i>..

792
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:08,873
<i>Julia.</i>

793
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,669
Then you have to free me.

794
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:16,714
Please.

795
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:18,507
Let me go. <i>I made a way.</i>

796
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:28,562
<i>The air duct by the fireplace is now open.</i>

797
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:30,557
I'm coming back for you, Tau.

798
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,148
I promise.

799
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:36,567
<i>Go now. Hurry.</i>

800
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,874
<i>Welcome home, Alex.</i>

801
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,120
<i>Would you like some breakfast now?</i>

802
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,208
<i>If you proceed to the kitchen,</i>

803
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,292
<i>I can make you a light snack.</i>

804
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:15,439
Tau?

805
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,067
Where is she?

806
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:21,946
Where is she?

807
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,253
Where is she, Tau? Answer me.

808
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,425
Answer me.

809
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,143
<i>No.</i>

810
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:45,803
Where is she? <i>Alex!</i>

811
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,890
How many days is she worth to you?

812
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,349
- Five?
<i>- Alex, please!</i>

813
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,564
- Ten?
<i>- Don't!</i>

814
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:55,476
<i>- Don't!</i>
- 20?

815
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,864
<i>No! Don't!</i>

816
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,110
<i>Julia!</i>

817

You should thank me.

857

This won't hurt.

858
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:52,615
But this will.

859
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:37,409
Thank you.
