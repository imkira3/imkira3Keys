We could have 100 million more.

1697
01:55:48,525 --> 01:55:50,735
<i>And these arrests
are a big step in that direction.</i>

1698
01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:53,905
<i>A beginning to an end of those who seek...</i>

1699
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:56,116
- Bob.
- Hey.

1700
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:58,118
Armbrecht was taken down at the airport.

1701
01:55:58,201 --> 01:55:59,369
Al right. Thank you.

1702
01:56:00,162 --> 01:56:01,538
- Good job.
- You, too.

1703
01:56:04,166 --> 01:56:05,750
Ain't that some shit, Bob?

1704
01:56:05,834 --> 01:56:09,171
Tischler bails when the shit goes down, and
then she shows up to take the credit, huh?

1705
01:56:09,254 --> 01:56:11,715
- Are you surprised?
- A little.

1706
01:56:13,508 --> 01:56:14,718
You know, you were right.

1707
01:56:15,886 --> 01:56:17,179
Of course, I'm always right.

1708
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:18,722
The informant.

1709
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:21,933
Okay, all right, I'm 99% right.

1710
01:56:25,604 --> 01:56:27,230
I loved Bob Musella.

1711
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:31,234
Me, too. Me, too.

1712
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:33,987
Hey, Bob.

1713
01:56:35,739 --> 01:56:37,741
Not all your friends
went to jail today, all right?

1714
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:50,295
- Hey.
- MAZU R: Hey.

1715
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:55,759
So, Customs is letting me keep the dress,
but not the pearls.

1716
01:56:56,510 --> 01:56:58,887
Too bad you gotjilted, you look so hot.

1717
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:01,389
-(ALL CHUCKLING)
-(PHONE RINGING)

1718
01:57:03,058 --> 01:57:05,810
Did you get him to talk?
I'm sorry. I'll catch you guys later.

1719
01:57:08,438 --> 01:57:09,648
You wanna help me?

1720
01:57:11,775 --> 01:57:12,776
Yeah.

1721
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:38,051
Well, it's still a pretty good ending.

1722
01:57:40,136 --> 01:57:41,263
It was, wasn't it?

1723
01:58:00,949 --> 01:58:02,158
Go home, Bob.

1724
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:16,840
EVELYN: You okay there?

1725
01:58:33,064 --> 01:58:34,482
Harley, you're up next.

1726
01:58:35,442 --> 01:58:36,818
Here, catch.

1727
01:58:44,743 --> 01:58:46,369
EVELYN; Hey.
MAZURI Hi.

1727
01:58:47,305 --> 01:59:47,818
