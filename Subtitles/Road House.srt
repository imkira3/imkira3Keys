2
00:00:32,385 --> 00:00:34,178
Â™ª Ran out of money

3
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:38,391
â™ª She ran out of love

4
00:00:40,393 --> 00:00:42,311
â™ª What more can she say?

5
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,610
Â™ª "If you love me, baby
pay the rent"

6
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:52,197
â™ª Don't throw stones
You don't know

7
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:58,411
â™ª It's not what you say
It's what you do

8
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:00,454
â™ª Don't throw your stones

9
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:15,761
Go ahead, sir.

10
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:20,266
Â™ª Twice as bad at work

11
00:01:22,268 --> 00:01:25,938
â™ª "If you love me
buy me a big TV

12
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:29,526
â™ª "You good-for-nothing
lazy jerk"

13
00:01:29,692 --> 00:01:31,735
No, no ifs,
ands and buts.

14
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:40,411
Â™ª It's not what you say
It's what you do

15
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,288
â™ª Don't throw your stones

16
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:50,212
â™ª Don't throw stones
You don't know

17
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:03,475
How about
some gold plastic?

18
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,627
You asshole.
What do you take me for?

19
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:31,212
For 100 bucks.

20
00:02:38,595 --> 00:02:40,430
Get the fuck away from him.

21
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:45,101
Get off of him! Let go!

22
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:54,068
I think it's time
for you gentlemen to leave.

23
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:56,153
Yeah. It's all right.

24
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,406
We were just
having a little fun.

25
00:02:58,573 --> 00:03:00,199
It's okay. Sorry.

26
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:15,172
Okay, Dalton.

27
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,425
I've always
wanted to try you.

28
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:18,884
I think I can take you.

29
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:21,137
Outside.

30
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:27,143
Okay.

31
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,061
So here we are.
Let's go.

32
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:30,521
Come on, hotshot.
Come on.

33
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,897
Come on.
Let's do it.

34
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:33,900
Hey,
dirtball, where you going?

35
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:36,194
Moose lips, get back here.
You dickhead.

36
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:38,780
What are you guys,
the seven dwarves or something?

37
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:48,122
Â™ª It's not what you say
It's what you do

38
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:52,167
â™ª Don't throw your stones

39
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:56,255
â™ª Don't throw your stones â™ª

40
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:19,278
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

41
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:20,863
The name's Dalton, right?

42
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:23,449
I don't know you.

43
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:26,243
My name is Tilghman,

44
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,787
Frank Tilghman.

45
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,916
I have a little club outside of
Kansas City called the Double Deuce.

46
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:39,715
It used to be a sweet deal.

47
00:04:41,217 --> 00:04:42,593
Now, it's the kind of place

48
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,472
that they sweep up
the eyeballs after closing.

49
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,932
Anyway, I've come into
a little bit of money.

50
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:54,647
I'd like to make
a better life for myself.

51
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,982
I need somebody
to help me clean the place up.

52
00:04:58,318 --> 00:04:59,610
I need the best.

53
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:02,321
Wade Garrett's the best.

54
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:04,406
Wade Garrett's getting old.

55
00:05:04,574 --> 00:05:05,825
He's still the best.

56
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:07,826
I want you.

57
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:17,502
$5,000 up front,
$500 a night, cash.

58
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,630
You pay all medical expenses.

59
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,800
I can live with that.

60
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:27,346
I run the show completely.

61
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:31,100
When the job's done, I walk.

62
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:32,685
I've got your plane
ticket right here.

63
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:35,354
I don't fly.

64
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:40,400
Too dangerous.

65
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:43,696
- Well, when do I expect you?
- Don't. I'll get there.

66
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,160
Dalton, you all right?

67
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:51,287
Just a scratch.

68
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:54,165
By the way, Oscar,
Band Stand's all yours.

69
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:55,708
What's that supposed to mean?

70
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:56,876
I'm out of here.

71
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:59,462
Great.

72
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:05,342
You know, I thought you'd be

73
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:07,053
bigger.

74
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:35,831
Yo.

75
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:40,460
What do I look like? A valet?

76
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:41,837
Keep it, it's yours.

77
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:29,385
Â™ª Well, I'm so tired of crying
but I'm out on the road again

78
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:32,054
â™ª I'm on the road again

79
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:36,433
â™ª Said I'm so tired of crying
but I'm out on the road again

80
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:38,144
â™ª I'm on the road again

81
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,147
Ladies!

82
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:46,318
All right, boy.

83
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:48,446
Hey, hotshot,

84
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:50,656
what's wrong
with Detroit cars?

85
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:58,581
...shitting me for.

86
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:00,416
Come on, let go.

87
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,418
Don't come back, peckerhead.

88
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:16,932
Bring on the real band.

89
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,185
Â™ª Take a tip from me
Baby, please

90
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:24,231
â™ª Don't you cry no more

91
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:27,234
â™ª But I ain't going
down that long

92
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:30,445
â™ª Old lonesome road
all by myself â™ª

93
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:32,865
You son of a bitch!

94
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:35,617
How many times did I tell you
not to cheat on me?

95
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,662
Yo, Steve.

96
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,916
Fuck 'em, they're brothers.

97
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,376
God damn it,
you're ripping my best fucking shirt.

98
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:48,506
You know,
I get off at 2:00 and

99
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:51,133
I'd just love to get you off
about a half an hour after that.

100
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:55,220
My God,
you're a put-together woman.

101
00:08:57,723 --> 00:08:59,766
Ladies first, asshole.

102
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:02,561
Come over here, baby.

103
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:04,813
Come here and sit with us
for a little while.

104
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:05,856
Damn it!

105
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:11,945
He's making me damn mad.

106
00:09:19,453 --> 00:09:20,704
Jesus, not here.

107
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:22,248
Follow me to the bathroom.

108
00:09:38,973 --> 00:09:40,265
- I need a drink.
- Okay.

109
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,686
One, two, three, four...

110
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:53,904
- Vodka rocks.
- You got it, baby.

111
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:58,951
Hey, vodka rocks.

112
00:09:59,118 --> 00:10:01,995
What do you say
you and me get nipple to nipple?

113
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:06,292
I can do that without you.

114
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:19,555
Get him out of here, now.

115
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:21,682
Come on, man.
Get your hands off me.

116
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,104
If you're not drinking,
you're out of here.

117
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:34,570
Hey,
don't let him bother you.

118
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:37,072
Morgan was born an asshole
and just grew bigger.

119
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,494
I'm Carrie Ann.

120
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:43,245
If you need anything,

121
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:47,040
anything,
you just let me know.

122
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:53,338
You got a name?

123
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:55,257
Yeah.

124
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:59,011
Well, what is it?

125
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:02,973
Dalton.

126
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:06,185
Oh, my God.

127
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:09,521
Shit, I heard of you.

128
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:11,190
Carrie Ann!

129
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:13,359
What are you waiting for?
Christmas?

130
00:11:13,526 --> 00:11:14,777
Move!

131
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:17,321
Shut up.
I'm going. Jesus Christ.

132
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:25,412
Â™ª No discouraging word
could be heard

133
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,789
â™ª 'Cause I'm a confidence man

134
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:34,963
â™ª Now, maybe Chicago
is where you're bound

135
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:39,802
â™ª But love is a cheap perfume
It hangs around

136
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:41,887
â™ª You roll the dice

137
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:44,765
â™ª Now let the bet stand

138
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:46,892
Get him out of here.

139
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,393
Let's go, Sleeping Beauty.

140
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,981
Come on, move.

141
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:54,191
Come on.

142
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:56,401
What do you think
this is, a rest home?

143
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:01,240
Â™ª 'Cause I'm
a confidence man â™ª

144
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:06,536
All right, y'all.
We'll be back in 10.

145
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:08,247
We got to drain
the main vein, man.

146
00:12:08,414 --> 00:12:09,665
Stick around.

147
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:11,792
Hey, you're paid to play.
Play!

148
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:44,325
Thanks, man.

149
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:47,620
So, you play pretty good
for a blind white boy.

150
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:49,455
Yeah, and I
thought you'd be bigger.

151
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:52,457
Dalton, how you doing?

152
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,709
It's good to see you.

153
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,419
Same here, man.

154
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:58,547
The boys and I heard
you were coming into town.

155
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:01,800
Man, this toilet is worse than
the one that we worked in Dayton.

156
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:03,718
Really?

157
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:05,971
It's a mean scene
around here, man.

158
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:10,600
Blood on the floor in
this joint every night.

159
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:12,561
Hey,
Hank, you know who that is?

160
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:14,354
- Who?
- Dalton.

161
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:17,566
Â™ª Wanna tell him maybe
about Uncle John

162
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,901
â™ª And then he got dizzy
but he had a lot of fun

163
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:21,653
â™ª Oh, baby, yeah

164
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:23,989
â™ª Yeah, baby

165
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:30,204
That guy at the end of the bar
is fucking Dalton, man.

166
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:34,332
He killed a guy once.

167
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,503
Ripped his throat right out.

168
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:40,297
Bullshit.

169
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:44,343
- What do you need, buddy?
- Coffee, black.

170
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,345
Yeah, all right.
Thanks, Bill.

171
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:52,226
Ever seen a better
pair of attitudes?

172
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,062
Fine, ain't they?

173
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:58,357
I'll tell you what.
For 20 bucks

174
00:13:58,524 --> 00:13:59,858
you can kiss them.

175
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:01,776
Are you kidding?

176
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:03,779
$10 a kiss. Here and now.

177
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,948
Go ahead. Do it. Go on.

178
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:10,536
Come on. Come on.

179
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:15,040
$10 a kiss. Go ahead.

180
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:28,303
Hey buddy,
what are you doing?

181
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,888
Are you going to
kiss them or not?

182
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:32,558
I can't.

183
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:34,643
What do you mean, you can't?

184
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,436
I ain't got $20.

185
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:39,356
Why, you...

186
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:46,070
Shit.

187
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:47,239
Fight!

188
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:53,996
Break it up!

189
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:23,317
You son of a bitch!

190
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:33,952
Bastard!

191
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,210
Â™ª Having us some fun tonight

192
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:46,173
â™ª Something going on
in the city

193
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,216
â™ª Saw my baby comin' â™ª

194
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,959
Fuck. Anybody got a mirror?

195
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:27,422
Shit.

196
00:16:31,677 --> 00:16:35,138
Hey, how'd you like to tell us
what the fuck's going on?

197
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:36,932
Are you gonna
help us out or not?

198
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,892
I'll let you know.

199
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:40,602
You know,
I heard you had balls

200
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,395
big enough to come
in a dump truck, but

201
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:44,523
you don't look
like much to me.

202
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:48,610
Opinions vary.

203
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,325
Cody.

204
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:56,993
Later.

205
00:16:57,161 --> 00:16:59,621
All right, man.
You take care. See you guys.

206
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,374
So,
what about this song for me?

207
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,710
This Dalton character,
what's his story?

208
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:09,381
The story is, you fuck with him,
and he'll seal your fate.

209
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:11,091
Yeah?

210
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:13,051
So far,
he hasn't shown me shit.

211
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,659
She's a runner.

212
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,334
- These work?
- Sure do.

213
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:56,762
I'll take it.

214
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:58,240
Good morning.

215
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,535
You the one who's
got a room to rent?

216
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:05,663
Come on.

217
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:14,964
You honest?

218
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:16,925
Yes, sir.

219
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:18,676
You expect me
to believe that?

220
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:20,553
No, sir.

221
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:48,539
God damn it.

222
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:21,573
I swear, he does that
just to piss me off.

223
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,616
- Who does?
- Brad Wesley.

224
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:34,252
You like horses, do you?

225
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,963
If they like me.

226
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,840
You wouldn't
steal them, would you?

227
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:41,509
No, sir.

228
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:44,846
Calling me "sir" is like putting
an elevator in an outhouse.

229
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:45,888
Don't belong.

230
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:48,182
I'm Emmet.

231
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,351
I'm Dalton.

232
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:05,200
So, what do you think?

233
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,410
Well, I'll take it.

234
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:14,251
Must've been 20 people
look at that room this past year.

235
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:16,420
No phone, no television.

236
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:20,716
No conditioned air,
no tolerance for the fragrance of nature.

237
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:22,842
Nobody wanted it.
How come you do?

238
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:28,222
You're just too
persuasive for me, I guess.

239
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,017
It ain't the money, you understand,
but if I don't charge you something

240
00:21:31,184 --> 00:21:35,021
the Presbyterians around here
are likely to pray for my ruination.

241
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:36,731
How's $100 a month strike you?

242
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,567
Fine.

243
00:21:39,735 --> 00:21:42,696
You can afford that much?

244
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:45,407
If it keeps you
in the good graces of the church.

245
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:48,326
Ain't it peculiar how money
seems to do that very thing?

246
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:51,955
Now this

247
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:55,083
is the new Double Deuce.

248
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,585
I put a lot of money
and time into this.

249
00:21:57,753 --> 00:22:00,046
And to protect my investment,
I've hired

250
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:03,049
the best damn
cooler in the business.

251
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:05,343
From now on,
he's in charge of all the bar business.

252
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,969
What he says goes.

253
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:10,265
Dalton.

254
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:20,900
Morgan, you're out of here.

255
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:22,986
What the fuck
you talking about?

256
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:25,530
You don't have the right
temperament for the trade.

257
00:22:25,697 --> 00:22:28,658
You asshole.
What am I supposed to do?

258
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:30,159
There's always barber college.

259
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:36,750
You're a dead man.

260
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:51,890
You're out, too.
We're selling booze here, not drugs.

261
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,394
Well, thank you.

262
00:23:01,274 --> 00:23:02,733
Anybody else here dealing?

263
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:06,738
I'm telling you straight.

264
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:09,616
It's my way or the highway.

265
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:13,787
So anybody who wants
to walk, do it now.

266
00:23:24,297 --> 00:23:25,089
All right.

267
00:23:29,094 --> 00:23:33,014
People who really want to have a good
time won't come to a slaughterhouse.

268
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:36,601
And we've got entirely
too many troublemakers here.

269
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:41,689
Too many 40-year-old adolescents,
felons, power drinkers

270
00:23:41,857 --> 00:23:44,234
and trustees of
modern chemistry.

271
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:46,319
It's going to change.

272
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:49,197
Man, that sure sounds good.

273
00:23:49,364 --> 00:23:53,201
But a lot of the guys who come
in here, we can't handle one on one.

274
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:54,994
Even two on one.

275
00:23:55,162 --> 00:23:56,746
Don't worry about it.

276
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:59,332
All you have to do
is follow three simple rules.

277
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:03,085
One, never
underestimate your opponent.

278
00:24:03,253 --> 00:24:04,796
Expect the unexpected.

279
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:08,633
Two, take it outside.

280
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,718
Never start
anything inside the bar

281
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:12,679
unless it's absolutely necessary.

282
00:24:14,222 --> 00:24:15,097
And three,

283
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:17,016
be nice.

284
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:20,645
Come on.

285
00:24:20,812 --> 00:24:25,358
If somebody gets in your face and calls
you a cocksucker, I want you to be nice.

286
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:26,484
Okay.

287
00:24:28,153 --> 00:24:29,904
Ask him to walk.

288
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:33,199
Be nice.
If he won't walk, walk him.

289
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:34,367
But be nice.

290
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:36,702
If you can't walk him,

291
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,956
one of the others will help you,
and you'll both be nice.

292
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:44,669
I want you to
remember that it's a job.

293
00:24:46,171 --> 00:24:47,964
It's nothing personal.

294
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:49,632
Uh-huh.

295
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,885
Being called
a cocksucker isn't personal?

296
00:24:52,511 --> 00:24:54,429
No.

297
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:57,932
It's two nouns combined
to elicit a prescribed response.

298
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:02,061
What if somebody calls
my mama a whore?

299
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,439
Is she?

300
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,153
I want you to be nice

301
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:15,783
until it's time to not be nice.

302
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:19,704
Well, how are we supposed
to know when that is?

303
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:22,915
You won't. I'll let you know.

304
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,210
You are the bouncers.
I am the cooler.

305
00:25:25,377 --> 00:25:28,213
All you have to do
is watch my back and each other's

306
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,466
and take out the trash.

307
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:33,217
One, two, three...

308
00:25:33,385 --> 00:25:35,678
â™ª 737 coming out of the sky

309
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:38,265
â™ª Won't you take me down
to Memphis on a midnight ride

310
00:25:38,431 --> 00:25:40,057
â™ª I want to move

311
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:41,893
â™ª Yeah, traveling band

312
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:45,021
â™ª Yeah

313
00:25:45,188 --> 00:25:47,190
â™ª Well, I'm flying
across the land Trying to get a hand

314
00:25:47,357 --> 00:25:50,360
â™ª Playing in a traveling band

315
00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:52,987
This is a Sears credit card.
Beverly, Agnes.

316
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:54,446
Hi, Steve.

317
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:56,824
It's okay.
They're friends of mine.

318
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:01,079
- But Dalton said...
- It's okay. Trust me. Right this way.

319
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:04,165
Â™ª Well, I'm flying
across the land Trying to get a hand

320
00:26:04,332 --> 00:26:06,083
- Leaded or unleaded?
- Leaded.

321
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:23,267
Hank!

322
00:26:28,023 --> 00:26:30,108
Come on, darling.

323
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:33,403
Pal, do me a favor, and get her
down off there. What do you say?

324
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,904
I say, let her dance.

325
00:26:42,787 --> 00:26:44,789
Come on, baby!

326
00:26:44,956 --> 00:26:48,042
Hey,
look, pal, we don't want...

327
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:50,044
Come on, motherfucker.
Stand back.

328
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:52,087
Come on.
Come on, motherfucker.

329
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,598
Escort this gentleman to the door.

330
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:07,145
Did you see that shit?
- That's Dalton.

331
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:12,817
Â™ª Well, I'm flying
across the land Trying to get a hand

332
00:27:12,984 --> 00:27:14,986
â™ª Playing in
a traveling band â™ª

333
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:17,822
Who is that guy?

334
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,368
He's good.

335
00:27:22,535 --> 00:27:24,578
He's real good.

336
00:27:26,414 --> 00:27:28,374
The name is Dalton.

337
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:36,799
Yeah.

338
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:39,219
You're gonna be my regular
Saturday-night thing, baby.

339
00:27:39,386 --> 00:27:41,596
Yeah.
I've been thinking about you.

340
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,851
Yo, Steve.

341
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,065
You're history.

342
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:54,734
But I'm on my break.

343
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:57,070
Stay on it.

344
00:27:58,363 --> 00:27:59,197
Shit.

345
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:02,074
You were hot that last set.

346
00:28:02,242 --> 00:28:03,826
Yeah,
we were good, weren't we?

347
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:06,079
You got quite
a little enterprise going here.

348
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:09,498
What?

349
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:12,293
You go through
a bottle every 30 minutes.

350
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,921
You're skimming the till for six
shots a bottle, on drafts, one every ten.

351
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:21,761
I figure he's costing you
about $150 a night.

352
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:23,971
So?

353
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,475
So,
consider it severance pay.

354
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:28,893
Take the train.

355
00:28:31,688 --> 00:28:33,106
I didn't hear you say that.

356
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,275
Well, I'm saying it now.

357
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:38,111
You sure?

358
00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:41,739
Get out.

359
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,128
Well, it was a good night.
Nobody died.

360
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:01,091
It'll get worse
before it gets better.

361
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,672
Â™ª Blue Monday
Ah, it's blue Monday

362
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:46,095
â™ª Got to work,
rather sleep all day

363
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:51,141
â™ª Here come Tuesday
Poor hard Tuesday

364
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:54,478
â™ª I'm so tired
Ain't got no time to play

365
00:29:56,147 --> 00:30:01,110
â™ª Here come Wednesday
I plead to myself

366
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:04,071
â™ª My gal calls
Gotta tell her that I'm out

367
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:09,535
â™ª 'Cause Thursday is
a hard workin' day

368
00:30:09,702 --> 00:30:13,038
â™ª And Friday I get my pay

369
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:17,501
â™ª Saturday morning
Oh, Saturday morning

370
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:21,422
â™ª All my tiredness
has gone away

371
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,048
I love this guy.

372
00:30:23,216 --> 00:30:24,967
- Isn't he cute?
- Darling.

373
00:30:25,135 --> 00:30:27,804
Â™ª ...and my honey

374
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:31,349
â™ª And I'm out
on the street to play â™ª

375
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:34,977
Dalton!

376
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:38,815
Hey, Dalton!

377
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:42,026
No.

378
00:30:44,696 --> 00:30:45,363
Dalton!

379
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:56,499
Morning.
I brought you some breakfast.

380
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,877
Shit.

381
00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:16,018
How'd you find me?

382
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:18,980
Oh, I, uh... It wasn't too hard.
I mean, you know...

383
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:26,153
What did you do
there last night?

384
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:29,990
What do you mean?

385
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:32,368
You fired the bartender, Pat.

386
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:34,746
He was skimming.

387
00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:38,499
You should not have
done that, Dalton.

388
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:42,169
Why is that?

389
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:44,422
You just shouldn't have,
that's all.

390
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:48,092
Here you go.

391
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:50,261
Breakfast.

392
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:53,055
Thank you.

393
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:57,018
Oh, my God.

394
00:31:59,187 --> 00:32:00,646
What is the joke?

395
00:32:00,813 --> 00:32:02,940
There's no joke.

396
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:06,693
I just think
I'm looking at a dead man, though.

397
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:09,947
It seems everywhere I go,
I hear that same joke.

398
00:32:10,114 --> 00:32:13,117
Something tells me
you bring it on yourself.

399
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:22,668
Â™ª Oh, life could be a dream

400
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:26,213
â™ª If I could take you up
to paradise up above

401
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:29,467
â™ª If you would tell me
I'm the only one that you love

402
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:32,637
â™ª Life could be a dream,
sweetheart

403
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:38,642
â™ª Now every time I look at you

404
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:42,230
â™ª Something is on my mind

405
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:45,817
â™ª If you do what I want you to

406
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:48,987
â™ª Baby, we'd be so fine

407
00:32:49,153 --> 00:32:50,904
â™ª Sh-boom sh-boom

408
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:54,741
â™ª Sh-boom sh-boom

409
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:56,368
â™ª Ya-da-da Da-da-da
Da-da-da Da â™ª

410
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:57,537
â™ª Sh-boom â™ª

411
00:33:16,723 --> 00:33:19,851
A new windshield's gonna cost you
more than that old beater's worth.

412
00:33:20,018 --> 00:33:22,103
My advice would be scrap her.

413
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,189
Well, I like her,
so order me one, would you?

414
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:26,940
It'll take a few days.

415
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:28,192
Aerial I can get you now.

416
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,234
Great.

417
00:33:34,198 --> 00:33:35,532
You the boy from
the Double Deuce?

418
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,992
Yes, sir.

419
00:33:39,037 --> 00:33:41,122
I kind of figured you'd be by.

420
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:44,000
You want to put in
a standing order now?

421
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,626
No, I'll pay as I go.

422
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:48,337
- Dalton.
- Red Webster.

423
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:49,963
How long are you
gonna be in town?

424
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:52,049
Not very long.

425
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:54,051
That's what I said 25 years ago.

426
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:56,136
Really?
What happened?

427
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:59,307
I got married to an ugly woman.
Don't ever do that.

428
00:33:59,474 --> 00:34:02,101
It just takes
the energy right out of you.

429
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:04,311
She left me, though.

430
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:07,190
Found somebody
even uglier than she was.

431
00:34:07,357 --> 00:34:09,359
That's life.
Who can explain it?

432
00:34:10,193 --> 00:34:11,569
Oh, that's $5.

433
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:16,240
So, uh, why'd you stay on?

434
00:34:16,407 --> 00:34:18,158
Oh, uh, I fell for the place.

435
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:28,335
Hello, Brad.

436
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:29,420
Red.

437
00:34:31,381 --> 00:34:33,007
Brad Wesley.

438
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:35,134
Dalton.

439
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:37,803
He's working at the Double Deuce.

440
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,639
Oh, terrific. Hope you're
gonna clean that place up.

441
00:34:40,807 --> 00:34:43,017
Bad element over there.

442
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:45,102
Well,
anything I can do for you...

443
00:34:47,105 --> 00:34:48,356
Thanks, Red.

444
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,782
Well, Red,

445
00:35:00,451 --> 00:35:02,619
beautiful day, isn't it?

446
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:03,621
Was.

447
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:47,307
Â™ª People preaching to me
about the life that I lead

448
00:36:47,475 --> 00:36:51,854
â™ª Saying it's unhealthy
running around at my speed â™ª

449
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:53,147
Problem?

450
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:54,648
There's no problem.

451
00:36:54,815 --> 00:36:56,900
Just a little mistake,
that's all.

452
00:36:57,068 --> 00:36:58,152
What's that?

453
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,404
My job.

454
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,658
You don't get it, do you?

455
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:06,993
Why don't you explain it to me?

456
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:08,412
I'll explain it to you.

457
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,372
Hey, shut up, shithead.

458
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,292
Mr. Tilghman has changed his mind.

459
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:16,170
And that's all you
need to know, son.

460
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:19,256
No, I'm afraid I'm going to have
to know a bit more than that.

461
00:37:19,423 --> 00:37:22,426
Mr. Tilghman may own this bar,
but the liquor he serves

462
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:25,679
is supplied to him
by Brad Wesley.

463
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:27,889
Pat McGurn is
in the employ of Mr. Wesley,

464
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:31,518
his uncle, not Mr. Tilghman.

465
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:34,939
You see, I'm staying,
and you're going.

466
00:37:35,106 --> 00:37:37,233
- Really?
- That's right.

467
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,943
Sit down.

468
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,986
Come on, Dalton.
You and me right now.

469
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:42,279
Right now!

470
00:37:44,365 --> 00:37:46,283
What's the matter,
you chicken dick?

471
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,285
What are you afraid of? Me?

472
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:52,206
Is that it, Dalton?
You scared to fight me?

473
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:53,707
You big, bad Dalton.

474
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:56,877
What do you want?
To kiss and make up?

475
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:04,259
Jesus Christ.

476
00:38:43,341 --> 00:38:44,717
Stand up. Get him up.

477
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:56,019
Get up.

478
00:38:58,439 --> 00:38:59,690
Get the fuck up.

479
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:02,526
You're out of here, pal.

480
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:08,573
- Hi.
- Hi.

481
00:39:16,374 --> 00:39:17,792
Hi, I'm Dr. Clay.

482
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:19,501
Hi.

483
00:39:22,505 --> 00:39:24,131
How'd this happen?

484
00:39:24,298 --> 00:39:26,133
Natural causes.

485
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,385
Looks like a knife wound.

486
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:29,719
Like I said.

487
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:35,476
You're a bouncer.

488
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:37,519
Mmm-hmm. Double Deuce.

489
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:41,273
Nice place.
They send a lot of business my way.

490
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,942
I'm hoping to change that.

491
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,402
All by yourself?

492
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:52,159
Mr. Dalton,
you may add nine staples

493
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:55,579
to your dossier of 31 broken bones,

494
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:57,372
two bullet wounds,
nine puncture wounds

495
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,375
and four stainless-steel screws.

496
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:02,086
That's an estimate, of course.
I'll give you a local.

497
00:40:02,253 --> 00:40:04,255
No, thank you.

498
00:40:04,422 --> 00:40:06,215
Do you enjoy pain?

499
00:40:06,382 --> 00:40:08,967
Pain don't hurt.

500
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:11,387
Most of my patients
would disagree with you.

501
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:13,054
Okay.

502
00:40:19,311 --> 00:40:21,229
Do you always carry your
medical records around with you?

503
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,942
It saves time.

504
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,197
Your file says
you've got a degree from NYU.

505
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:31,073
What in?

506
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,116
Philosophy.

507
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,289
Any particular discipline?

508
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:40,541
No, not really. Um...

509
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:43,502
Man's search for faith.
That sort of shit.

510
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:46,588
Come up with any answers?

511
00:40:46,756 --> 00:40:48,924
Not too many.

512
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:52,094
How's a guy like you
end up a bouncer?

513
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:53,720
Just lucky, I guess.

514
00:40:59,018 --> 00:41:01,812
Dr. Golden,
please call the nurse's station in ICU.

515
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:11,113
Nice work.
Good, clean stitches.

516
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,572
Thank you.

517
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:16,702
Do you ever win a fight?

518
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:18,704
Nobody ever wins a fight.

519
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:27,004
There you go.

520
00:41:27,171 --> 00:41:28,172
Thanks.

521
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:31,508
Listen, uh,

522
00:41:34,428 --> 00:41:37,681
if, uh, you'd like to stop by
the Double Deuce sometime,

523
00:41:37,848 --> 00:41:39,641
I'd buy you a of coffee,
if you...

524
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:41,685
Happen to be in the neighborhood?

525
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:51,528
For that line of work,
I thought you'd be bigger.

526
00:41:54,073 --> 00:41:56,116
Gee, I've never
heard that before.

527
00:42:48,419 --> 00:42:50,671
Did I explain it wrong?

528
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:52,840
- Is that it?
- No, boss, you didn't.

529
00:42:53,007 --> 00:42:55,259
Pat's got
a weak constitution.

530
00:42:55,426 --> 00:42:58,554
You boys know that.
That's why he's working as a bartender.

531
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:00,556
He's my only sister's son.

532
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:02,725
And if he doesn't
have me, who's he got?

533
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:05,019
And if I'm not there,
you're there.

534
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:08,605
I should have let you go, Jimmy.

535
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:12,651
One of you boys
owes me an apology.

536
00:43:12,818 --> 00:43:14,277
Now, I leave it up
to you to decide

537
00:43:14,445 --> 00:43:17,030
which one of you wants
to say, "I'm sorry."

538
00:43:19,033 --> 00:43:21,577
- I'm sorry, boss.
- I'm sorry, boss.

539
00:43:21,744 --> 00:43:23,287
I believe you, Tinker.

540
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:28,083
But you, O'Connor,
somehow I don't believe you.

541
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,293
You better try it again.

542
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:32,504
If there's one thing I can't stand,
it's a man who's untruthful.

543
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:34,547
I'm sorry, boss.

544
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:36,341
One thing that disgusts me is
a man who can't admit when he's wrong.

545
00:43:36,508 --> 00:43:38,009
I swear to God,
boss, I'm sorry.

546
00:43:38,177 --> 00:43:39,803
You disgust me.
You want to know why?

547
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,137
No, why, boss?

548
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:47,644
Because you're a bleeder.
You bleed too much.

549
00:43:49,021 --> 00:43:50,731
You are a messy bleeder.

550
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:54,651
You're weak.

551
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:56,778
You got no endurance for pain.

552
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,159
Come on. Get up.

553
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:03,827
You'll be fine. Come on.

554
00:44:06,497 --> 00:44:07,998
Well, help him up!

555
00:44:12,711 --> 00:44:14,796
You're gonna be fine.

556
00:44:14,964 --> 00:44:16,548
And you know why?

557
00:44:16,715 --> 00:44:18,049
Because I like you.

558
00:44:23,222 --> 00:44:25,641
Get this piece of shit
coward out of here.

559
00:44:34,274 --> 00:44:36,192
Work ain't work
when you're having fun.

560
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,819
Life is good.

561
00:45:00,092 --> 00:45:01,051
Jesus.

562
00:45:04,304 --> 00:45:05,221
Red?

563
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:08,350
- Red?
- Yeah?

564
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:11,645
What happened?
Did you get robbed?

565
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:13,063
Every week.

566
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:26,159
So, what does he take?

567
00:45:26,326 --> 00:45:28,077
- Who?
- Brad Wesley.

568
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,334
Ten percent, to start.

569
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:37,671
It's all legal like.

570
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:40,966
He formed the Jasper
Improvement Society.

571
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:43,135
All the businesses
in town belong to it.

572
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:46,138
Everybody pay?

573
00:45:49,224 --> 00:45:51,226
Does a hobbyhorse
have a wooden dick?

574
00:45:53,771 --> 00:45:56,690
Pour it on. Squirt it on.

575
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:09,953
Charge!

576
00:46:11,163 --> 00:46:13,623
Come back here, you jarhead.

577
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:17,503
Take it easy, Rambo. I know you want
to save the world from the commies,

578
00:46:17,669 --> 00:46:20,129
but you're gonna have to do
it from down here, man.

579
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:22,507
Squirt him.

580
00:46:22,674 --> 00:46:24,759
- Hose him down.
- Cool him off.

581
00:46:24,927 --> 00:46:26,094
Let's get him.

582
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:29,473
Garrett!
Yo.

583
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,016
Some guy, name of Dalton.

584
00:46:34,728 --> 00:46:36,479
What's going on, mijo?

585
00:46:36,647 --> 00:46:38,482
Hey. How you doing, buddy?

586
00:46:38,649 --> 00:46:41,318
Shit. Hell, kid.
I'm in hog heaven.

587
00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:45,113
If I was doing any better,
I couldn't live with myself. How 'bout you?

588
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,532
I'm all right.

589
00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:49,867
By God, you ought to be,
all that money you're making, right?

590
00:46:50,035 --> 00:46:52,203
What's going on down in Jasper?

591
00:46:52,371 --> 00:46:54,831
You know.
New town, same story.

592
00:46:57,376 --> 00:46:59,086
Um, listen,

593
00:47:00,712 --> 00:47:02,922
you ever heard of a guy
named Brad Wesley?

594
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,425
No, can't say that I have.

595
00:47:05,592 --> 00:47:06,509
You having trouble?

596
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,930
Nothing I'm not used to.

597
00:47:10,097 --> 00:47:12,766
But it's amazing what
you can get used to.

598
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:14,851
Tell me about it.

599
00:47:15,018 --> 00:47:17,520
This place has a sign
hanging over the urinal, says,

600
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:19,356
"Don't eat the big white mint."

601
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,486
Stay cool, kid.

602
00:47:25,654 --> 00:47:27,614
- Right.
- Got to go.

603
00:47:27,781 --> 00:47:29,532
I'll see you later.

604
00:47:42,796 --> 00:47:46,549
Â™ª Ooh, I don't wanna lose
this good thing

605
00:47:48,635 --> 00:47:50,511
â™ª That I've got

606
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:52,514
â™ª 'Cause if I did

607
00:47:52,681 --> 00:47:54,182
â™ª I would surely

608
00:47:55,642 --> 00:47:58,353
â™ª Surely lose a lot

609
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,564
â™ª For your love
is better

610
00:48:04,276 --> 00:48:06,528
Why won't you look me
in the eye, Dalton?

611
00:48:06,695 --> 00:48:08,488
I'm shy.

612
00:48:08,655 --> 00:48:10,114
Would you be shocked

613
00:48:10,282 --> 00:48:12,701
if I said, "Let's go
to my place and fuck"?

614
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:17,330
It ain't gonna kill you.

615
00:48:19,082 --> 00:48:20,958
You know,
you might even like it.

616
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,921
Say good night, Denise.

617
00:48:36,183 --> 00:48:37,184
Let go.

618
00:48:54,785 --> 00:48:57,037
Â™ª Lightning

619
00:48:57,204 --> 00:48:59,623
â™ª The way you love me
is frightening

620
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:04,044
â™ª I think I better
knock on wood

621
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:05,962
I didn't know she could sing.

622
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:13,511
Right boot.

623
00:49:17,683 --> 00:49:18,517
Got it.

624
00:49:23,981 --> 00:49:25,482
Sorry, we're closed.

625
00:49:25,649 --> 00:49:28,360
Then what are all
these people doing here?

626
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:30,654
Drinking and
having a good time.

627
00:49:31,989 --> 00:49:33,782
That's why we're here.

628
00:49:35,492 --> 00:49:37,160
You're too stupid
to have a good time.

629
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:01,643
Go, Dalton. Kick his ass.

630
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:21,704
All right, yeah.

631
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,544
Son of a bitch!

632
00:50:29,629 --> 00:50:31,589
Give me the biggest
guy in the world,

633
00:50:31,757 --> 00:50:33,717
you smash his knee,
he'll drop like a stone.

634
00:50:41,641 --> 00:50:43,142
Damn good fight.

635
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,064
- Hi.
- Hi.

636
00:50:50,025 --> 00:50:51,317
So, you looking for somebody?

637
00:50:51,485 --> 00:50:52,360
You.

638
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,761
Are you always
better than they are?

639
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:22,265
Pretty much.

640
00:51:22,432 --> 00:51:23,766
Never been put down?

641
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:25,602
No.

642
00:51:26,395 --> 00:51:27,562
Not really.

643
00:51:28,605 --> 00:51:30,273
How do you explain that?

644
00:51:32,859 --> 00:51:35,862
The ones who go looking for
trouble are not much of a problem

645
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:37,530
to someone who's
ready for them.

646
00:51:37,697 --> 00:51:40,074
I suspect it's
always been that way.

647
00:51:46,289 --> 00:51:48,666
Somebody has to do it.

648
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:51,086
Somebody's got to
pay somebody to do it.

649
00:51:53,088 --> 00:51:54,506
Might as well be you.

650
00:51:59,177 --> 00:52:01,721
I better take you home.

651
00:52:01,888 --> 00:52:05,892
If I keep talking you're going
to go off thinking I'm a nice guy.

652
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:07,810
I know you're not a nice guy.

653
00:52:11,064 --> 00:52:14,192
Pretty soon I'm gonna have to
start charging that bum rent.

654
00:52:18,113 --> 00:52:19,447
Tonight's rent.

655
00:52:42,846 --> 00:52:43,930
Your fan club?

656
00:52:44,097 --> 00:52:45,181
They are devoted.

657
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,817
You live some
kind of life, Dalton.

658
00:52:58,278 --> 00:52:59,696
Too ugly for you.

659
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,324
I didn't say that.

660
00:53:27,265 --> 00:53:28,557
- See you.
- Bye.

661
00:54:07,847 --> 00:54:10,266
We've been looking
all over for you.

662
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:17,565
Mr. Wesley wants to see you.

663
00:54:18,525 --> 00:54:19,609
Let's go.

664
00:54:27,867 --> 00:54:28,868
After you.

665
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,473
Â™ª I want to know
just one thing

666
00:54:53,435 --> 00:54:56,563
â™ª This is the way I feel

667
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,773
â™ª I'm not pretending â™ª

668
00:55:02,152 --> 00:55:04,529
Hey, Dalton.
Have a Bloody Mary?

669
00:55:06,323 --> 00:55:07,324
Some breakfast?

670
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,824
No, thank you.

671
00:55:08,992 --> 00:55:10,493
Well, suit yourself.

672
00:55:12,203 --> 00:55:13,954
Will you shut that shit off?

673
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:21,003
I can't listen to that crap.
It's got no heart.

674
00:55:29,888 --> 00:55:31,598
My grandfather.

675
00:55:31,765 --> 00:55:33,349
Looks like an important man.

676
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:35,601
He was an asshole.

677
00:55:37,896 --> 00:55:39,772
But you,

678
00:55:39,939 --> 00:55:42,107
you're a smart boy,
aren't you, Dalton?

679
00:55:42,275 --> 00:55:43,859
You're just not too realistic.

680
00:55:45,278 --> 00:55:46,904
Christ, I'm just like you.

681
00:55:47,072 --> 00:55:51,034
I came up the hard way
from the streets of Chicago.

682
00:55:51,201 --> 00:55:54,204
You know, when I came to this
town after Korea, there was nothing.

683
00:55:54,371 --> 00:55:56,289
I brought the mall here.

684
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:59,625
I got the 7-11,
I got the Photomat here.

685
00:55:59,793 --> 00:56:02,378
Christ, JC Penney is coming
here because of me.

686
00:56:02,545 --> 00:56:04,463
You ask anybody,
they'll tell you.

687
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:10,011
You've gotten rich
off of the people in this town.

688
00:56:11,554 --> 00:56:13,222
You bet your ass I have.

689
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:14,891
And I'm gonna get richer.

690
00:56:18,061 --> 00:56:21,147
I believe we all have
a purpose on this earth.

691
00:56:21,314 --> 00:56:24,692
A destiny. I have
a faith in that destiny.

692
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:29,822
It tells me to gather
unto me what is mine.

693
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:32,574
But Christ, you get
paid for beating people up.

694
00:56:32,742 --> 00:56:34,243
Tell me you don't love it.

695
00:56:34,411 --> 00:56:35,829
Of course you do.

696
00:56:35,995 --> 00:56:37,788
You wouldn't be
human if you didn't.

697
00:56:46,339 --> 00:56:48,674
I have a cousin in Memphis.

698
00:56:48,842 --> 00:56:51,636
Tells me you
killed a man down there.

699
00:56:51,803 --> 00:56:54,972
Tells me you said it was
self-defense at the trial.

700
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,433
But you and I know
that isn't so, don't we?

701
00:56:59,978 --> 00:57:01,354
Relax.

702
00:57:07,152 --> 00:57:08,987
Tell me,

703
00:57:09,154 --> 00:57:13,283
if I owned a bar and
wanted to clean it up,

704
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,411
how much would it take
to get you to come work for me?

705
00:57:24,627 --> 00:57:26,128
There's no amount of money.

706
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,732
Â™ª Keep your eyes on the road

707
00:57:45,899 --> 00:57:48,443
â™ª Your hands upon the wheel

708
00:57:51,654 --> 00:57:52,988
Hey, we're here.

709
00:58:11,132 --> 00:58:12,883
Â™ª The back of the roadhouse

710
00:58:13,051 --> 00:58:16,137
â™ª They got some bungalows

711
00:58:18,431 --> 00:58:20,599
â™ª Yeah
The back of the roadhouse

712
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:23,436
â™ª They got some bungalows

713
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,527
â™ª And that's for the people
who like to get down slow

714
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:37,575
â™ª Let it roll, baby, roll

715
00:58:37,742 --> 00:58:40,911
â™ª Let it roll, baby, roll

716
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:43,872
Thanks.

717
00:58:45,416 --> 00:58:48,877
Â™ª Let it roll

718
00:58:49,045 --> 00:58:50,921
â™ª All night long â™ª

719
00:58:56,427 --> 00:58:58,220
Good to see you.

720
00:59:04,394 --> 00:59:06,521
Ernie, what's the story?

721
00:59:06,688 --> 00:59:08,231
Whiskey's running low.

722
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:12,818
I finally get this
place just the way I want it,

723
00:59:12,986 --> 00:59:15,488
and now we're running out of booze.

724
00:59:15,655 --> 00:59:17,782
I've called every supplier I know.

725
00:59:19,284 --> 00:59:20,910
Why won't they deliver?

726
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:23,328
Wesley.

727
00:59:23,496 --> 00:59:25,080
Ernie, give me the phone.

728
00:59:27,917 --> 00:59:29,585
I'll take care of it.

729
00:59:41,472 --> 00:59:42,264
Hi.

730
00:59:48,479 --> 00:59:50,647
I hear you're
the new marshal in town.

731
00:59:50,815 --> 00:59:51,774
You heard wrong.

732
00:59:51,941 --> 00:59:52,942
Uh-oh.

733
00:59:55,361 --> 00:59:56,528
Dig a hole.

734
01:00:09,709 --> 01:00:11,544
This is your place?

735
01:00:11,711 --> 01:00:12,670
Up there.

736
01:00:33,316 --> 01:00:36,319
It's quiet, and the horses let
me know if anybody comes around.

737
01:00:37,487 --> 01:00:38,654
I love it.

738
01:01:18,695 --> 01:01:21,698
Â™ª ...arms of mine

739
01:01:23,032 --> 01:01:26,201
â™ª They are lonely

740
01:01:29,122 --> 01:01:34,085
â™ª Lonely and feeling blue

741
01:01:34,252 --> 01:01:36,545
I saw your picture in
Red Webster's place.

742
01:01:36,713 --> 01:01:37,964
He's my uncle.

743
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:40,257
Nice old guy.

744
01:01:41,175 --> 01:01:42,467
Yeah.

745
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:44,470
He raised me
after my parents died.

746
01:01:44,637 --> 01:01:46,430
That's why I came back here.

747
01:01:46,597 --> 01:01:48,390
Now we take care of each other.

748
01:01:50,643 --> 01:01:52,895
So, how come you
never got married?

749
01:01:53,062 --> 01:01:54,021
I did.

750
01:01:55,398 --> 01:01:56,482
What happened?

751
01:01:56,649 --> 01:01:57,358
Didn't work.

752
01:01:58,484 --> 01:01:59,234
Why?

753
01:02:00,695 --> 01:02:02,405
Guess I picked the wrong guy.

754
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:10,204
Â™ª These arms of mine

755
01:02:11,497 --> 01:02:14,875
â™ª They are burning

756
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:21,674
â™ª Yearning from wanting you

757
01:02:23,009 --> 01:02:27,388
â™ª And if you

758
01:02:27,555 --> 01:02:32,184
â™ª Would let them hold you

759
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:38,775
â™ª Oh, how grateful I will be

760
01:02:38,941 --> 01:02:43,487
â™ª These arms of mine

761
01:02:43,654 --> 01:02:46,948
â™ª They are burning

762
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:54,832
â™ª Burning from wanting you

763
01:02:54,999 --> 01:02:59,670
â™ª These arms of mine

764
01:02:59,837 --> 01:03:03,340
â™ª They are wanting

765
01:03:05,802 --> 01:03:09,138
â™ª Wanting to hold you

766
01:03:11,474 --> 01:03:15,644
â™ª And if you

767
01:03:15,812 --> 01:03:20,358
â™ª Would let them hold you

768
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:26,113
â™ª Oh, how grateful I will be

769
01:03:30,034 --> 01:03:32,995
â™ª Come on, come on baby

770
01:03:35,289 --> 01:03:38,834
â™ª Just be my little woman

771
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:41,795
â™ª Just be my lover

772
01:03:43,214 --> 01:03:46,091
â™ª I need me somebody

773
01:03:46,259 --> 01:03:49,011
â™ª Someone to treat me right

774
01:03:51,264 --> 01:03:54,934
â™ª I need
your woman's loving arms

775
01:03:55,101 --> 01:03:58,604
â™ª To hold me tight

776
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:04,318
â™ª And I need
your tender lips â™ª

777
01:04:53,534 --> 01:04:54,910
Mmm.

778
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,457
Little Rock.

779
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:03,252
You're going to have a lot of
pain when you get older, Dalton.

780
01:05:03,419 --> 01:05:06,422
You could be crippled
if you don't slow down.

781
01:05:06,589 --> 01:05:08,632
Yeah, that's what they say.

782
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:10,342
You already know that?

783
01:05:10,509 --> 01:05:12,511
No, I just said,
"That's what they say."

784
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:22,437
Where are you
going to go from here?

785
01:05:27,235 --> 01:05:28,486
I don't know.

786
01:05:30,363 --> 01:05:33,115
You could stay, Dalton,
if you wanted to.

787
01:05:38,746 --> 01:05:39,872
I don't think so.

788
01:06:27,628 --> 01:06:28,545
Hang on!

789
01:06:35,594 --> 01:06:37,012
You got a woman
up there with you?

790
01:06:37,179 --> 01:06:38,722
That's right.

791
01:06:38,889 --> 01:06:40,140
Don't give me no lip, Lord.

792
01:06:40,308 --> 01:06:42,059
Where'd she get to?

793
01:06:42,226 --> 01:06:43,477
She'll be back.

794
01:06:43,644 --> 01:06:46,313
If you're smart,
you'd pitch your tent.

795
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,441
Sometimes I'm not as smart
as I'd like to be.

796
01:06:49,608 --> 01:06:53,153
You never know, son. Maybe she'll
be smart enough for both of you.

797
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:57,616
Thanks, Ernie.

798
01:06:59,785 --> 01:07:01,411
- Hi, Dal.
- Hi, honey.

799
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:03,163
Hey, there he is.

800
01:07:03,331 --> 01:07:04,707
- What's up?
- What do you say?

801
01:07:08,169 --> 01:07:09,336
Hey, Cody.

802
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:11,505
Hey, bro.
What's going down?

803
01:07:11,672 --> 01:07:12,631
Not too much.

804
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:16,384
That's not what I hear.

805
01:07:16,552 --> 01:07:19,555
The word is, you've been
spending time with Elizabeth Clay.

806
01:07:21,474 --> 01:07:23,309
So?

807
01:07:23,476 --> 01:07:25,769
You know who had a thing
for Elizabeth Clay?

808
01:07:25,936 --> 01:07:27,228
Brad Wesley.

809
01:07:29,398 --> 01:07:33,735
As I hear it,
she left town and he went nuts.

810
01:07:36,822 --> 01:07:38,657
It's a small town.
And I don't...

811
01:07:38,824 --> 01:07:39,616
Dalton!

812
01:07:41,243 --> 01:07:42,410
The truck's here.

813
01:07:44,163 --> 01:07:46,165
Okay.

814
01:07:46,332 --> 01:07:49,001
Of course,
that's just the word.

815
01:07:49,168 --> 01:07:51,086
- Thanks.
- No problem.

816
01:08:15,653 --> 01:08:17,112
The Double Douche.

817
01:08:32,545 --> 01:08:33,379
Hey!

818
01:08:35,172 --> 01:08:36,506
Put them back.

819
01:08:36,674 --> 01:08:38,133
This bar is closed for business.

820
01:08:39,969 --> 01:08:41,637
It's okay, Jim. Take a break.

821
01:08:50,563 --> 01:08:52,439
Can I buy you guys a drink?

822
01:08:54,817 --> 01:08:56,485
Guess not.

823
01:09:14,128 --> 01:09:16,505
You got a skinny little runt
named Dalton working here?

824
01:09:19,049 --> 01:09:20,925
He's out the back.

825
01:09:21,093 --> 01:09:22,344
I know you.

826
01:09:24,472 --> 01:09:26,724
Pour me a beer, will you?
I'll be back.

827
01:09:29,143 --> 01:09:30,853
How do you like that,
kung fu?

828
01:09:32,938 --> 01:09:34,230
How's it going, mijo?

829
01:09:36,066 --> 01:09:38,193
Mind your own business, dad.

830
01:09:44,074 --> 01:09:46,451
Do you want to fight,
dickless?

831
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:48,621
I sure ain't gonna
show you my dick.

832
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:54,877
Shit!

833
01:09:55,044 --> 01:09:56,670
Damn, that hurts, doesn't it?

834
01:10:11,977 --> 01:10:13,895
Hey,
there's a fight out back.

835
01:10:26,492 --> 01:10:27,993
I had it under control.

836
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,369
Yeah, I knew that.

837
01:10:30,955 --> 01:10:31,997
Glad to see you.

838
01:10:32,164 --> 01:10:33,039
Good to see you.

839
01:10:33,207 --> 01:10:35,334
Who is that guy?

840
01:10:35,501 --> 01:10:37,419
Gentlemen, Wade Garrett.

841
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:39,629
Holy shit.

842
01:10:40,839 --> 01:10:42,173
Exactly right.

843
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:46,261
Morgan, nice to see you.

844
01:10:50,516 --> 01:10:53,101
Where in the fuck
are we going now?

845
01:10:53,269 --> 01:10:55,271
I got somebody I want you to meet.

846
01:10:56,814 --> 01:10:57,481
Uh-oh.

847
01:11:09,201 --> 01:11:10,744
I thought you said
you were all right.

848
01:11:10,911 --> 01:11:12,287
I'm fine.

849
01:11:16,834 --> 01:11:18,293
I fucking knew it!

850
01:11:20,045 --> 01:11:21,296
Hi.

851
01:11:21,463 --> 01:11:22,797
Hey.

852
01:11:27,386 --> 01:11:31,473
1975, Albuquerque.

853
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,393
Got blindsided by
a bottle of Jack Daniels.

854
01:11:35,561 --> 01:11:38,146
Fucking around somewhere where
I shouldn't have been at the time.

855
01:11:38,314 --> 01:11:40,607
I was very drunk.

856
01:11:40,774 --> 01:11:43,401
The kid here got
his head cracked.

857
01:11:43,569 --> 01:11:44,778
You got the scar.

858
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:48,365
I'll show you a scar.

859
01:11:48,532 --> 01:11:51,117
I'll show you one I'm real
sentimental about, Doc.

860
01:11:57,124 --> 01:11:57,958
A woman?

861
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:01,169
Boy, was she.

862
01:12:01,337 --> 01:12:03,881
God, I feel like dancing.
You like to dance, Doc?

863
01:12:04,048 --> 01:12:05,174
Yeah.

864
01:12:05,341 --> 01:12:06,884
What time is it?

865
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:08,886
Daytime.

866
01:12:09,053 --> 01:12:11,680
Good, then some other place
will be open. Let's get out of here.

867
01:12:11,847 --> 01:12:15,767
Take this lady someplace where
it's a little more romantic. Let's go.

868
01:12:15,934 --> 01:12:17,310
He's serious.

869
01:12:17,478 --> 01:12:19,188
- Come on.
- Well, we'd better go.

870
01:12:23,942 --> 01:12:25,026
There you are.

871
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:38,873
Â™ª All my ex's

872
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:41,168
â™ª Live in Texas â™ª

873
01:12:41,335 --> 01:12:43,628
Yee-haw!

874
01:12:43,796 --> 01:12:47,549
Â™ª And Texas is a place
I'd dearly love to be

875
01:12:47,716 --> 01:12:51,136
God, he's great coming out of
the gate, but not much for stamina.

876
01:12:51,303 --> 01:12:55,390
Â™ª But all my ex's
live in Texas

877
01:12:57,935 --> 01:13:03,732
â™ª And that's why I hang my hat
in Tennessee

878
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:06,026
Is this the part where you tell
me what a great guy your friend is?

879
01:13:06,193 --> 01:13:07,402
Not hardly.

880
01:13:09,738 --> 01:13:12,490
This is the part where I tell you,
I want you for myself.

881
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,077
Uh, yo...

882
01:13:16,245 --> 01:13:19,164
Whatever he's saying,
you can be fairly sure it's a lie.

883
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:25,795
Â™ª But I'm alive and well
in Tennessee â™ª

884
01:13:28,632 --> 01:13:29,924
Don't bet on it.

885
01:13:32,136 --> 01:13:33,387
Thanks, Doc.

886
01:13:35,097 --> 01:13:36,556
Excuse me, gentlemen.

887
01:13:44,022 --> 01:13:47,608
That gal's got entirely too
many brains to have an ass like that.

888
01:13:50,529 --> 01:13:52,572
You've got
your hands full, kid.

889
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:57,828
What's the matter?

890
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,626
You're still living
in the past, aren't you?

891
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:08,463
We're a long way from Memphis.

892
01:14:10,883 --> 01:14:11,967
Memphis has nothing to do with it.

893
01:14:12,134 --> 01:14:13,802
Bullshit.

894
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:16,846
That dog won't hunt.

895
01:14:17,014 --> 01:14:22,352
I can't believe you're still
dragging that shit around with you.

896
01:14:22,519 --> 01:14:26,397
It seems to me, you'd be a
little more philosophical about it

897
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,151
and cut it the fuck loose.

898
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:34,614
You know, that fucking c...

899
01:14:36,492 --> 01:14:40,621
That girl never told you
she was married.

900
01:14:42,414 --> 01:14:43,498
Did she?

901
01:14:46,335 --> 01:14:51,423
And when a man sticks a gun in
your face, you got two choices.

902
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:53,675
You can die, or you can
kill the motherfucker.

903
01:15:02,935 --> 01:15:04,937
Don't mean to
bust up the party or anything,

904
01:15:05,103 --> 01:15:06,938
but my shift starts
in a couple of hours.

905
01:15:07,105 --> 01:15:08,606
Yeah.

906
01:15:08,774 --> 01:15:11,401
Thought I'd go home
and get a little sleep.

907
01:15:11,568 --> 01:15:13,570
Aren't you guys tired?

908
01:15:13,737 --> 01:15:17,115
Doc, I'll get all the sleep
I need when I'm dead.

909
01:15:17,282 --> 01:15:18,533
Thanks for the dance.

910
01:15:23,956 --> 01:15:24,873
Bye.

911
01:16:20,053 --> 01:16:21,929
Hey, Dalton,
Red's place is on fire!

912
01:16:43,285 --> 01:16:44,119
Oh, my God!

913
01:17:04,389 --> 01:17:05,640
Come on, stay with me!

914
01:17:15,984 --> 01:17:19,320
With a fire like that,
nothing they could do. Nothing.

915
01:17:19,488 --> 01:17:20,780
Jack Daniels.

916
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:34,085
Thank you.

917
01:17:34,252 --> 01:17:37,213
It's like a morgue in here.
Play something, Elvis!

918
01:17:37,381 --> 01:17:40,342
Get those firemen in here.
I want to buy them a drink.

919
01:17:40,509 --> 01:17:42,427
They risked their lives
to save a no-good,

920
01:17:42,594 --> 01:17:44,596
faggot draft-dodger
like Red Webster.

921
01:17:44,763 --> 01:17:46,890
Ask for a little contribution
to improve the town,

922
01:17:47,057 --> 01:17:49,017
everybody digs deep,
except for him.

923
01:17:51,853 --> 01:17:53,855
Of course you can dance, honey.

924
01:17:54,022 --> 01:17:56,774
Elvis, play something with balls.

925
01:17:56,942 --> 01:17:58,193
Showtime, guys.

926
01:18:14,126 --> 01:18:16,211
Â™ª Gypsy woman told my mother

927
01:18:17,671 --> 01:18:19,089
â™ª 'Fore I was born

928
01:18:21,133 --> 01:18:24,010
â™ª She said you got
a boy child comin'

929
01:18:24,177 --> 01:18:27,305
â™ª He's goin' to be
a son of a gun

930
01:18:27,472 --> 01:18:32,101
â™ª Gonna make pretty women
jump and shout

931
01:18:34,312 --> 01:18:39,233
â™ª And the world gonna know
what's it all about

932
01:18:39,401 --> 01:18:41,069
â™ª You gotta know I'm here

933
01:18:43,864 --> 01:18:45,657
Move it!

934
01:18:47,909 --> 01:18:49,118
Gimme a little bit.

935
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:56,917
Â™ª Well, I'm
the hoochie-coochie man

936
01:18:58,628 --> 01:19:01,422
â™ª And everybody knows I'm here

937
01:19:07,763 --> 01:19:09,306
â™ª I got a black cat bone

938
01:19:11,099 --> 01:19:12,892
â™ª I got a mojo too

939
01:19:14,686 --> 01:19:17,480
â™ª I got a
John the Conquer root

940
01:19:17,647 --> 01:19:20,941
â™ª I'm gonna mess with you
I'm gonna make you

941
01:19:24,488 --> 01:19:26,448
â™ª Lead me by my hand

942
01:19:27,949 --> 01:19:30,368
â™ª Then the world will know

943
01:19:30,535 --> 01:19:33,079
â™ª I'm the hoochie-coochie man

944
01:19:33,246 --> 01:19:35,331
â™ª Everybody knows I'm here

945
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:50,054
â™ª Hoochie-coochie man

946
01:19:52,265 --> 01:19:54,934
â™ª You better believe I'm here

947
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:20,126
If you're going to have a pet,
keep it on a leash.

948
01:20:21,211 --> 01:20:22,587
You're right.

949
01:20:22,754 --> 01:20:23,838
Jimmy.

950
01:20:55,829 --> 01:20:57,831
Â™ª On the seventh hour

951
01:20:59,082 --> 01:21:00,541
â™ª Of the seventh day

952
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:04,045
â™ª On the seventh month

953
01:21:05,672 --> 01:21:08,883
â™ª The seventh doctor said

954
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:11,886
â™ª He said
he's born for good luck

955
01:21:12,053 --> 01:21:14,346
â™ª And that you see

956
01:21:14,514 --> 01:21:18,601
â™ª I've got $700, baby

957
01:21:18,768 --> 01:21:20,978
â™ª And don't you mess with me

958
01:21:21,146 --> 01:21:24,941
â™ª Because you know I'm here â™ª

959
01:21:43,501 --> 01:21:45,461
Can somebody get
a drink around here?

960
01:22:07,609 --> 01:22:08,443
You!

961
01:22:37,055 --> 01:22:38,639
Come on, old man.

962
01:22:56,283 --> 01:22:57,993
All right, that's enough.

963
01:23:03,581 --> 01:23:05,165
This isn't working out, Dalton.

964
01:23:11,464 --> 01:23:12,590
Let's go, boys.

965
01:23:16,845 --> 01:23:18,388
Your ass is mine, boy.

966
01:23:27,022 --> 01:23:29,149
Same town, new story, pal.

967
01:23:32,819 --> 01:23:34,028
Let's get a beer.

968
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:40,660
I've talked till I'm blue
in the face, God damn it.

969
01:23:40,827 --> 01:23:42,703
We could salvage the place, Red.

970
01:23:42,871 --> 01:23:44,706
We could build it back up.
I'll help you out.

971
01:23:44,873 --> 01:23:46,124
Nope.

972
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:48,001
But you got insurance, don't you?

973
01:23:48,168 --> 01:23:49,794
For 20 years,
I watched Wesley get richer,

974
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:52,421
while everybody around him
got poorer.

975
01:23:52,589 --> 01:23:54,799
Can you prove he started the fire?

976
01:23:54,966 --> 01:23:56,801
Who you going to prove it to?

977
01:23:56,968 --> 01:23:58,844
He has the sheriff and
the police force in his pocket,

978
01:23:59,012 --> 01:24:00,722
for Christ's sake.

979
01:24:00,889 --> 01:24:04,309
I can call a friend in
Springfield who works for the FBI.

980
01:24:04,476 --> 01:24:06,644
Are you going to
take the stand against him?

981
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:13,984
There's only one person
around here

982
01:24:14,152 --> 01:24:15,862
you've got to prove anything to.

983
01:24:16,029 --> 01:24:17,572
That's Wesley himself.

984
01:24:23,495 --> 01:24:26,164
You scared him last night.

985
01:24:26,331 --> 01:24:28,583
Brad Wesley, he's not afraid
of anything, right?

986
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:31,753
Last night, that son
of a bitch was afraid.

987
01:24:33,338 --> 01:24:34,589
No, he wasn't.

988
01:24:51,189 --> 01:24:53,357
Dalton, check this out.
Wesley wants to put

989
01:24:53,525 --> 01:24:55,360
a little something down
on a new car.

990
01:25:00,698 --> 01:25:02,991
You lost your faith, Strodenmire.

991
01:25:03,159 --> 01:25:05,077
That's what it is.

992
01:25:05,245 --> 01:25:06,663
It's made you an abuser.

993
01:25:08,706 --> 01:25:10,457
Well, what are you
waiting for, Gary?

994
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:12,168
Drive through there!

995
01:25:15,004 --> 01:25:17,256
No! No! No!

996
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:20,093
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

997
01:25:48,037 --> 01:25:50,706
Oh, my God.

998
01:25:50,874 --> 01:25:52,250
Yeah!

999
01:26:00,467 --> 01:26:02,844
What the hell is
wrong with you, Brad?

1000
01:26:03,011 --> 01:26:04,429
Have you lost your mind?

1001
01:26:06,055 --> 01:26:07,890
He's a drifter, you know.

1002
01:26:08,057 --> 01:26:10,851
To see you wind up
with someone like that is a shame.

1003
01:26:11,019 --> 01:26:13,021
This has nothing to do with him.

1004
01:26:13,188 --> 01:26:14,147
Well...

1005
01:26:15,607 --> 01:26:17,650
You get him out of here, Elizabeth.

1006
01:26:17,817 --> 01:26:21,904
Because if you don't,
he's going down.

1007
01:26:22,071 --> 01:26:24,615
And I'm not going to lose
a second's sleep about it.

1008
01:26:35,418 --> 01:26:36,669
Strodenmire.

1009
01:26:41,299 --> 01:26:43,384
I never thought
you'd turn on me, too.

1010
01:26:45,386 --> 01:26:46,720
This is my town.

1011
01:26:50,183 --> 01:26:51,350
Don't you forget it.

1012
01:26:53,186 --> 01:26:54,478
Let's go, Jimmy.

1013
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:00,234
You got insurance, don't you?

1014
01:27:22,298 --> 01:27:24,717
Hey, little amigo.

1015
01:27:24,884 --> 01:27:26,927
You're all fucked up,
aren't you?

1016
01:27:32,058 --> 01:27:34,518
Let's crank that thing up
and head down the road.

1017
01:27:36,229 --> 01:27:37,521
We can be gone by dawn.

1018
01:27:37,689 --> 01:27:39,691
Never see this place again.

1019
01:27:39,857 --> 01:27:41,942
You can leave anytime you want to.

1020
01:27:42,902 --> 01:27:43,944
Shit, kid.

1021
01:27:50,743 --> 01:27:51,618
Fuck.

1022
01:28:09,178 --> 01:28:10,470
You don't need this.

1023
01:28:10,638 --> 01:28:12,765
Don't tell me what I need.

1024
01:28:12,932 --> 01:28:15,935
If you want to go, go. Get the
fuck out of here and leave me alone.

1025
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,897
Yeah, you're right.

1026
01:28:20,064 --> 01:28:23,192
I ought to stop
telling you what to do.

1027
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:25,235
Maybe I ought to kick your ass.

1028
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:30,908
No, we don't want to do this.

1029
01:28:34,245 --> 01:28:36,330
And I'll tell you something else.

1030
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,460
You taught me as much
as I ever taught you.

1031
01:28:48,009 --> 01:28:49,427
I love you, mijo.

1032
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:53,806
I'll see you.

1033
01:29:27,006 --> 01:29:27,715
Dalton.

1034
01:29:30,551 --> 01:29:32,219
Little late for
a house call, don't you think?

1035
01:29:32,387 --> 01:29:34,013
I came to talk to you.

1036
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:35,598
No,

1037
01:29:35,765 --> 01:29:38,392
you came to tell me to leave.

1038
01:29:38,559 --> 01:29:40,310
I care about you, Dalton.

1039
01:29:40,478 --> 01:29:41,979
You don't know him.

1040
01:29:42,146 --> 01:29:43,063
Bullshit.

1041
01:29:45,858 --> 01:29:48,193
I know exactly
who Brad Wesley is.

1042
01:29:48,361 --> 01:29:50,863
I've seen his kind many times.

1043
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:55,451
He keeps taking and taking
until somebody takes him.

1044
01:29:55,618 --> 01:29:57,661
It's obvious nobody in this
town can stand up to him.

1045
01:29:57,829 --> 01:29:59,247
But you can stop him.

1046
01:29:59,414 --> 01:30:01,374
Brad Wesley picked me.

1047
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:03,584
And when he did, he fucked up.

1048
01:30:05,169 --> 01:30:07,171
I'm only good at one thing, Doc.

1049
01:30:07,338 --> 01:30:08,547
I never lose.

1050
01:30:08,715 --> 01:30:10,383
But what are you going to win?

1051
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:12,885
Who's this for anyway?
Are you doing it for them?

1052
01:30:14,095 --> 01:30:15,429
I don't think so.

1053
01:30:18,766 --> 01:30:21,602
Do you think you're gonna
save these people from Brad Wesley?

1054
01:30:21,769 --> 01:30:23,854
Well, who's gonna
save them from you?

1055
01:30:35,283 --> 01:30:36,492
Emmet!

1056
01:30:42,957 --> 01:30:43,874
Emmet!

1057
01:31:20,369 --> 01:31:21,578
Emmet!

1058
01:31:21,746 --> 01:31:24,582
It's Dalton.
Are you all right?

1059
01:31:24,749 --> 01:31:26,625
I'd be fine if you'd get off of me.

1060
01:31:59,784 --> 01:32:01,410
Prepare to die.

1061
01:32:01,577 --> 01:32:03,161
You are such an asshole.

1062
01:33:25,077 --> 01:33:27,287
I used to fuck guys
like you in prison.

1063
01:33:43,638 --> 01:33:45,222
Damn, boy.

1064
01:33:45,389 --> 01:33:47,140
I thought you were good.

1065
01:33:47,308 --> 01:33:48,225
Go fuck yourself.

1066
01:34:18,547 --> 01:34:20,674
I'm gonna kill you
the old-fashioned way.

1067
01:35:03,634 --> 01:35:04,718
Wesley!

1068
01:35:09,306 --> 01:35:11,057
Wesley!

1069
01:35:14,103 --> 01:35:15,229
Wesley!

1070
01:35:18,524 --> 01:35:20,067
Fuck you!

1071
01:36:08,157 --> 01:36:10,617
Hello.
- Top of the morning to you.

1072
01:36:10,785 --> 01:36:13,037
Here's what's on for today.

1073
01:36:13,204 --> 01:36:15,456
Wade? Or Elizabeth?

1074
01:36:16,707 --> 01:36:17,457
What?

1075
01:36:18,876 --> 01:36:20,294
One of them dies.

1076
01:36:21,962 --> 01:36:23,463
Now, who will it be?

1077
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:30,178
You are a sick man.

1078
01:36:31,722 --> 01:36:34,391
Well, I just have to flip a coin.

1079
01:36:34,558 --> 01:36:35,809
Hold on a second.

1080
01:36:37,728 --> 01:36:38,812
Wesley?

1081
01:36:47,321 --> 01:36:49,239
Dalton,

1082
01:36:49,406 --> 01:36:51,491
I'd sure like to tell you
how it turned out.

1083
01:36:55,746 --> 01:36:57,164
Wesley.

1084
01:37:11,846 --> 01:37:13,222
Garrett. Oh, my God.

1085
01:37:15,474 --> 01:37:16,516
Over here.

1086
01:37:21,063 --> 01:37:22,481
Are you all right?

1087
01:37:23,816 --> 01:37:25,484
There was only three of them.

1088
01:37:28,028 --> 01:37:29,529
They said I was lucky.

1089
01:37:33,659 --> 01:37:34,951
I got to find Doc.

1090
01:37:36,579 --> 01:37:38,330
Let's go.

1091
01:37:38,497 --> 01:37:41,458
Sit the fuck down.
Have a beer. I'll be back.

1092
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:42,459
Hey.

1093
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:49,007
Wesley wins, man.
We're out of here.

1094
01:37:50,467 --> 01:37:51,926
That a boy, mijo.

1095
01:38:03,189 --> 01:38:04,398
Where's Dr. Clay?

1096
01:38:04,565 --> 01:38:05,399
She's in X-ray.

1097
01:38:14,742 --> 01:38:16,076
Get your things.
We're out of here.

1098
01:38:16,243 --> 01:38:17,786
I'm not going anywhere with you.

1099
01:38:20,414 --> 01:38:22,958
Yes, you are.
Let's go. Now.

1100
01:38:24,335 --> 01:38:25,377
Forget it.

1101
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:32,467
Doc,

1102
01:38:33,886 --> 01:38:35,137
the man is crazy.

1103
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:38,890
And you're not?

1104
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:44,438
Now, get out of here.

1105
01:39:20,641 --> 01:39:21,850
Yo.

1106
01:39:22,017 --> 01:39:23,893
Wake the fuck up.

1107
01:39:24,061 --> 01:39:25,395
We're out of here.

1108
01:39:27,731 --> 01:39:29,232
I said one beer, senor.

1109
01:40:34,548 --> 01:40:37,551
Remember that blonde? Whew.
She could suck-start a Harley.

1110
01:40:40,804 --> 01:40:42,055
There he is.

1111
01:41:00,657 --> 01:41:01,574
Get out of here!

1112
01:41:39,154 --> 01:41:40,446
Find that prick.

1113
01:42:00,592 --> 01:42:01,509
O'Connor?

1114
01:42:08,809 --> 01:42:09,768
Shit.

1115
01:42:55,772 --> 01:42:56,647
Tails again.

1116
01:43:38,023 --> 01:43:39,399
I hate this place.

1117
01:44:08,804 --> 01:44:10,305
Mr. Wesley!

1118
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:16,770
You're made for each other.

1119
01:44:27,864 --> 01:44:29,907
I see you found
my trophy room, Dalton.

1120
01:44:32,286 --> 01:44:33,912
The only thing that's missing

1121
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:35,956
is your ass.

1122
01:44:38,584 --> 01:44:41,211
What's this all about, anyway?

1123
01:44:41,378 --> 01:44:43,004
Your friend Wade?

1124
01:44:43,171 --> 01:44:45,339
One old man?

1125
01:44:45,507 --> 01:44:47,300
That's what I call
a mercy killing.

1126
01:44:47,467 --> 01:44:50,303
I took him out of his misery.

1127
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:52,805
Now, you're not mad at me
about that, are you?

1128
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,976
Hell, you took Jimmy.

1129
01:44:56,143 --> 01:44:57,602
He was in better shape.

1130
01:45:02,316 --> 01:45:03,984
Hell, you took all my boys.

1131
01:45:20,334 --> 01:45:22,002
Now, come on out, Dalton.

1132
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,007
This town is big enough
for both of us.

1133
01:45:28,175 --> 01:45:29,676
Let's talk about this.

1134
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:40,914
I thought it would be fun
to fight you.

1135
01:46:41,081 --> 01:46:42,415
I really did.

1136
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:46,628
But now,
I just don't have the time.

1137
01:47:22,497 --> 01:47:23,581
No!

1138
01:47:25,417 --> 01:47:26,543
It's over!

1139
01:47:44,853 --> 01:47:47,814
This is our town,
and don't you forget it.

1140
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:28,188
Brad, where are you?

1141
01:48:28,355 --> 01:48:29,522
They're in here, Sheriff.

1142
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:42,410
All right, who's gonna tell
me what the hell happened here?

1143
01:48:42,577 --> 01:48:43,995
I didn't see nothing.

1144
01:48:45,956 --> 01:48:47,415
You see anything, Pete?

1145
01:48:47,582 --> 01:48:48,874
No, I didn't see anything.

1146
01:48:50,377 --> 01:48:52,587
You see anything, Red?

1147
01:48:52,754 --> 01:48:55,631
I didn't see nothing.
Not a thing.

1148
01:48:55,799 --> 01:48:57,675
You see anything, Tinker?

1149
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:08,686
A polar bear fell on me.

1150
01:49:17,654 --> 01:49:20,281
Â™ª Look out across the fields

1151
01:49:20,448 --> 01:49:22,575
â™ª See me returning

1152
01:49:25,245 --> 01:49:28,039
â™ª Smoke is in your eyes

1153
01:49:28,206 --> 01:49:29,832
â™ª You draw a smile

1154
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:37,089
â™ª From the fireplace where
my letters to you are burning

1155
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:44,848
â™ª You've had time to
think about it for a while

1156
01:49:47,309 --> 01:49:52,272
â™ª Well, I've walked 200 miles
Look me over

1157
01:49:55,275 --> 01:50:00,071
â™ª It's the end of the chase
and the moon is high

1158
01:50:02,365 --> 01:50:06,035
â™ª It won't matter
who loves who

1159
01:50:06,202 --> 01:50:10,539
â™ª You'll love me
or I'll love you

1160
01:50:12,626 --> 01:50:15,128
â™ª When the night comes falling

1161
01:50:16,504 --> 01:50:19,673
â™ª When the night comes falling

1162
01:50:19,841 --> 01:50:22,385
â™ª When the night comes falling

1163
01:50:22,552 --> 01:50:24,053
â™ª From the sky

1164
01:50:41,821 --> 01:50:44,907
â™ª I can see through your walls

1165
01:50:45,075 --> 01:50:47,160
â™ª I can tell
that you're hurting

1166
01:50:50,038 --> 01:50:54,000
â™ª Sorrow covers you up
like a cape

1167
01:50:57,379 --> 01:51:01,841
â™ª Only yesterday I know
that you've been flirting

1168
01:51:04,594 --> 01:51:08,848
â™ª With disaster
Somehow managed to escape

1169
01:51:12,102 --> 01:51:16,981
â™ª Well, I can't provide
for you no easy answers

1170
01:51:20,110 --> 01:51:24,364
â™ª Who are you that
I should have to lie?

1171
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:30,786
Â™ª You'll know
all about it, love

1172
01:51:30,954 --> 01:51:34,332
â™ª It'll fit you like a glove

1173
01:51:37,210 --> 01:51:40,755
â™ª When the night comes falling

1174
01:51:40,922 --> 01:51:44,675
â™ª When the night comes falling

1175
01:51:44,843 --> 01:51:47,345
â™ª When the night comes falling

1176
01:51:47,512 --> 01:51:48,888
â™ª From the sky

1177
01:52:36,936 --> 01:52:42,107
â™ª For all eternity
I think I will remember

1178
01:52:44,611 --> 01:52:49,198
â™ª That icy wind that's howling
in your eye

1179
01:52:51,826 --> 01:52:55,412
â™ª You will see me in your time

1180
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:59,458
â™ª In the wasteland
of your mind

1181
01:53:01,836 --> 01:53:05,464
â™ª When the night comes falling

1182
01:53:05,632 --> 01:53:09,510
â™ª When the night comes falling

1183
01:53:09,677 --> 01:53:12,137
â™ª When the night comes falling

1184
01:53:12,305 --> 01:53:13,848
â™ª From the sky

1185
01:53:16,893 --> 01:53:19,186
â™ª When the night comes falling

1186
01:53:20,688 --> 01:53:24,066
â™ª When the night comes falling

1187
01:53:24,234 --> 01:53:26,903
â™ª When the night comes falling

1188
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:28,738
â™ª From the sky â™ª

1189
