2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,232
I don't wanna scare anyone...

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,069
...but I'm gonna give it to
you straight about Jason.

4
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,449
His body was never recovered
from the lake after he drowned.

5
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,913
If you listen to the old-timers,
they'll tell you he's still out there.

6
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:44,626
- Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed.
- It's got a death curse.

7
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,671
Some folks claim they've
even seen him...

8
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,256
...right in this area.

9
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,509
Who is that?

10
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,971
Oh, hi. What are you doing
out in this mess?

11
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:03,562
The girl who survived that night
at Camp Blood, that Friday the 1 3th...

12
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,690
...she claims she saw him.

13
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,152
The boy. ls he dead too?

14
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,283
We didn't find any boy.

15
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,703
<i>Then he's still there.</i>

16
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,124
She disappeared two months later.

17
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,590
Legend has it that Jason saw
his mother beheaded that night...

18
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,389
...and he took his revenge.

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,199
A revenge that he'll continue to seek
if anyone enters his wilderness again.

20
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,705
Jason was my son.
And today is his birthday.

21
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,170
That's a good boy.

22
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,090
- Good.
- Good Jason.

23
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,566
Jason's out there.

24
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,201
No! Aah! Aah!

25
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,459
You can't be alive!

26
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,231
Got another white coming in, Larry.
Let's keep the area clear.

27
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,402
Where are they?

28
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,595
What do you need
and where do you need it?

29
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,390
We got ten of them.
Yours is in the barn.

30
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,225
What's wrong with him?

31
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,771
He's dead. Yeah, they're all dead.
You can pull it up over there.

32
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,733
- All dead. Some emergency.
- Put her over there.

33
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,591
This the guy that's been leaving
the wet stuff?

34
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,429
This time he got seven kids
and three bikers.

35
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,889
This time they got him.

36
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,226
- Lainie?
- Hmm?

37
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,896
- Belt him.
- Yeah.

38
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,115
What's the matter with you?
He's dead.

39
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,964
<i>Okay,
boys and girls, let's get rolling!</i>

40
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,095
God!

41
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,482
<i>Dr. Wellsely to O.R. 2.</i>

42
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,568
Here, sign it.

43
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,488
Hmm? Mm.

44
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,411
- This your last?
- No, got one more over there.

45
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,958
- Real cute girl.
- Was.

46
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:08,964
She still is. All you gotta do
is go over there....

47
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,926
Nice talk. Real nice talk.
I get the top copy.

48
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,181
- Take care, Axel.
- Mm.

49
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,683
Man, he's crazy.

50
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:29,192
<i>Miss Aaron,
telephone, please. Miss Aaron.</i>

51
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,487
- I'm free, doll.
- And a bargain at twice the price.

52
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,448
- Hey. What's the matter?
- I have a headache, Axel.

53
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,160
- For you, I always have a headache.
- Oh, I can fix that.

54
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,620
Oh.

55
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,248
Meet me in the cold room.

56
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,209
I'm closing up for the night.
What do you say? Okay?

57
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:50,797
Axel, I am not going to
fake any more orgasms for you.

58
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,384
You got the curse?

59
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,305
If I do, you're it.

60
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,564
Axel?

61
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,445
Axel.

62
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,330
Oh, Axel.

63
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,678
Axel?

64
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,933
Aah! God, Axel!

65
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,019
I'm so glad you could come.

66
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,438
Axel, you are the
Super Bowl of self-abuse!

67
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,107
I just came to watch the news.

68
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,571
<i>Now back to today's news.
The tragic story of mass slayings....</i>

69
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,366
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

70
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,662
<i>And so begins
yet another chapter in a story...</i>

71
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,456
<i>...most residents of Crystal Lake
had prayed was over.</i>

72
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:10,085
<i>A trail of mangled bodies has finally
led local authorities to conclude--</i>

73
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,173
I really came to watch the news.

74
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,389
<i>We're still awaiting
positive identification of the body.</i>

75
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,643
<i>But to answer your question,
yes, the man responsible...</i>

76
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,021
<i>...for the murders in Wessex County
this past week...</i>

77
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,274
<i>...is at this moment in the Wessex
County Medical Center morgue.</i>

78
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,860
- Yeah!
- Hey.

79
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,571
That's you they're talking about
on TV, pal.

80
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,907
I don't believe you, Axel.

81
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:45,328
- Then...shut...my...mouth.
- My...mouth.

82
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,833
<i>--in the wake
of what will always be known...</i>

83
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,713
<i>...as the Crystal Lake massacres.
And now back to you, Bill.</i>

84
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,364
Jesus Christmas!

85
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,616
Holy Jesus goddamn!

86
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,246
Holy Jesus jumping Christmas shit!

87
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,915
You better get that sucker
in the icebox!

88
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,376
I must be nuts! I mean, I really....

89
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,715
- Good night, Axel.
- Hey, where are you going?

90
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,427
I'll tell you where I'm going,
I'm going crazy!

91
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,708
Shit! Shit!

92
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,904
Hi, girls. Thanks for waiting.

93
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,786
Oh, no.

94
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,878
Shit!

95
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:15,061
Get lost, Axel, I'm busy. I've had
more than enough of you for one night.

96
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:21,276
Read my lips. Leave me alone! Aah!

97
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,652
No!

98
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,835
- I talked to Dad.
- How is he?

99
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:43,214
Oh. He said he was lonely.
He asked me to come out and see him.

100
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,717
Did he tell you to take a number?

101
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,178
No, but he asked about you.

102
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,722
Did he?

103
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,516
Actually, you really should
go out there to see him.

104
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,059
Yeah, I know.

105
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,688
I bet he could stand a visit.

106
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,025
What do you think?

107
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,485
- I think you're getting horny.
- Oh!

108
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,866
Tommy, turn that down!

109
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,452
Mom, I got 98,000.

110
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,623
- How many robots is that?
- Thirty-five.

111
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,294
Now, why don't you try killing
a few more up in your room?

112
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:25,006
I can't. I need a bypass patch cord.

113
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,967
Maybe you can get one in town.

114
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,802
Trish will drive you.

115
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:35,016
Oh, honey, get a haircut, hmm?

116
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,060
Oh, Ma.

117
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:43,191
- That's a nice mask.
- Do I have to get a haircut?

118
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,444
You're getting pretty terrific
at making those things.

119
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,406
Thanks. I just customized it.

120
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,118
- Where's Gordon?
- He went out.

121
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,163
Oh. Someone left the front door open.

122
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,998
We're in the country.

123
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,584
Well, what happens
if the psycho wanders in?

124
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,671
He'd probably challenge him
to a game of "Zaxxon."

125
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,506
Hear any more
about the place next door?

126
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,508
Mm-hm. It's been rented by some kids.

127
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,635
- Great.
- How many?

128
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,764
- Six.
- It'll be nice to have some company.

129
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,315
<i>Country boy, country boy</i>

130
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,025
<i>Sitting in the grass</i>

131
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,653
<i>Along came a prairie dog
And crawled right up his</i>

132
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,029
<i>Ask me no more questions</i>

133
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,866
You broke up with BJ Betty?

134
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:39,831
So to speak. And would you
lighten up on her? She's all right.

135
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,460
Yeah, I'll say she's all right.

136
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,507
You should have treated her right.

137
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,011
I mean, that girl wanted
to be treated right.

138
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,390
I did. I did. I treated her right.

139
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,768
I treated her right.
That's what's driving me so crazy.

140
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,188
I mean, first I would call her
and she would take my calls...

141
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,149
...but she would have something to do.

142
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,192
And then she wouldn't even
take my calls.

143
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,612
I mean, can you figure that?
What the fuck happened?

144
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,949
Let me put it in the old computer.

145
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:19,203
- No, I'm serious about this.
- Hey, the computer don't lie.

146
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,915
Now, let's see.

147
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,513
What?

148
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,851
It says....

149
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,645
It says you're a dead fuck.

150
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,192
What? A dead fuck?

151
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,278
A lousy lay. You know?

152
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,696
- A dead pecker.
- Oh, I see.

153
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,407
Don't hold it back from me, doc.
Give it to me straight.

154
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,451
I did not say it. The computer did.

155
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,205
- Yeah, well, there is no computer!
- Aha! And there's no Betty either.

156
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,043
Then I'm a dead fuck.

157
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,754
Like I said, the computer don't lie.

158
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,805
God, I'm horny.

159
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:36,239
- Where are we now?
- Lost.

160
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,282
We are lost.

161
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,203
Pretty creepy, huh?

162
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,791
Yeah.

163
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,585
All right, I think I got it.

164
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,131
Go straight ahead two miles
and hang a right.

165
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,154
Paul, let's pick her up.

166
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,531
Sammy, where we gonna put her?

167
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,870
Hey, honey, you got a sister?

168
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,830
Ruff, ruff!

169
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,333
Oh, Mom, I thought we were having pizza.

170
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,004
I thought so too, honey, but we've got
a refrigerator full of leftovers.

171
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,717
You're not smiling. You're not
in the mood for my tuna salad?

172
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,762
- Well....
- I'm not either.

173
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,766
I'm in the mood for....

174
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,143
- No.
- Yes.

175
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,062
I feel like....

176
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,148
- No!
- A Jarvis sandwich!

177
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,281
- Wait, somebody's at the door.
- Oh, no, you don't.

178
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,660
- No, Mom, I heard that too.
- I'll go.

179
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:53,000
Gordon! Hey, Gordon.
Where have you been, huh, Gordon?

180
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,504
Have you been sneaking around?
Do you have a girlfriend or something?

181
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,589
Tommy, close the door.

182
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,094
Listen, Gordon, we'll talk later.

183
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,643
All right.

184
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,569
- Hit me with the beer.
- You got it.

185
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:25,116
- See? What did I tell you?
- What? You told me you were horny.

186
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,245
No, see, I've come to realize
that a guy can have a good time...

187
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,248
...without having to
have girls all about.

188
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,918
That's a sin, you dead fuck.

189
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,546
I really, really don't want you
to call me that anymore.

190
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,214
<i>Aw.</i>

191
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,220
Hi. What a handsome mutt you are.

192
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,849
- His name's Gordon. I'm Trish.
- Hi, Trish.

193
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,694
I don't know how you do it.

194
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,739
Heh. I don't know how you don't.

195
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,657
I mean...

196
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,285
...you do it with everybody.

197
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,620
Oh, I do not!

198
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,622
I do it with Paul.

199
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,960
- Really?
- Come on, Sara!

200
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,297
You know how guys are.
They lie about that all the time.

201
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,507
They say that about everybody.

202
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,885
They don't say anything about me.

203
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,636
I mean, I don't have....

204
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,639
- Ha, ha. A reputation?
- I didn't say that.

205
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:34,935
Oh. Look, I got my reputation
in sixth grade.

206
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,355
Well, what does Paul think?

207
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:42,693
Paul thinks I'm great in bed,
so that's where I keep him. Ha, ha.

208
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:48,824
What are the sleeping arrangements here,
anyway?

209
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,453
Paul and I are taking the bedroom
at the end of the hall...

210
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,455
...so you and Doug can sleep next door.

211
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,000
Really?

212
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:02,838
Yeah. It's okay, they're bunk beds.
Don't worry about it.

213
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:17,019
I'm gonna go to bed now, Mom.
Good night.

214
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,105
Don't forget, 6 a.m.

215
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,440
Once around the lake.

216
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,900
Good night.

217
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,528
- Sleep well.
- You too, Mom.

218
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,773
I think when we get into town
I should give Betty a call.

219
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,027
Ted. Ted?

220
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,197
I think when we get to town
I should call Betty.

221
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:38,077
Jimbo, calling Betty is definitely
a dead-fuck thing to do.

222
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:44,291
Look, first rule of love: Never get
rejected by the same girl twice.

223
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,793
I mean, that's useless.

224
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,920
If you wanna make a fool
out of yourself...

225
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,423
...always do it with someone new.

226
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,842
Well, I don't know anybody new.

227
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,263
Well, sex is a great way
to meet them.

228
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,098
Ooh. Oh, my!

229
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,977
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

230
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,854
- Don't worry about it.
- Hi.

231
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,356
Hi.

232
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:12,778
- You, uh-- You girls live around here?
- How far is it to Crystal Point?

233
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,448
- Well, that's where we're going.
- Yeah. It's a long walk.

234
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,202
- We can take it.
- I'm going back to get the car.

235
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,830
- Sara, do you want some company?
- This way?

236
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,166
Thanks. I'll just meet you guys there.

237
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,210
All right.

238
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,879
They're cute.

239
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,259
Two of them. Two.
Count them, one, two.

240
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,013
- Yes, yeah, and two of us.
- Exactly.

241
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,031
Come on in! Ha, ha.

242
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,785
Oh. No.

243
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,746
No, we have no suits.

244
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,709
All right!

245
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,003
All right!

246
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,172
Skinny-dip! Ah!

247
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,141
Whoo! Sam!

248
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,907
- Gordon, wait up!
- Gordon.

249
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,370
Gordon, wait up! Wait a minute!

250
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,288
Gordon!

251
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,755
- Jimmy!
- Come on, Jimmy!

252
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,218
Come on, Jimmy!

253
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,061
Whoa.

254
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,566
- Turn around.
- Can't I just--?

255
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,445
- Turn around!
- Trish, come on in!

256
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,781
No, thanks.
I think I'm overdressed.

257
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,076
- Hey, Trish!
Bye-bye.

258
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,203
Party tonight!

259
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,456
Come on, Gordon,
we're too young for this.

260
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,709
Some pack of patootsies, huh?

261
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,627
Tommy.

262
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,382
Oh, no.

263
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,426
What next?

264
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,659
Can you fix it?

265
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:54,249
- I need a screwdriver.
- Maybe there's one in the trunk.

266
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,881
I need the keys.

267
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,091
Thanks.

268
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,316
Tommy, come on!

269
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,785
Come in, Sara,
let's see what you got.

270
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:33,831
- No.
- Come on, Sara. Strip and dip.

271
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,376
Sam, I said no.

272
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,963
Well, then, I'm gonna go under
and stay under until you do.

273
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,298
See you later.

274
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,230
Sam?

275
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,816
Sam!

276
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,194
Sam!

277
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,864
God, Sam!

278
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,949
God.

279
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,617
Sam!

280
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,205
Sam! Sam!

281
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,333
Sam! Sam!

282
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,342
Aah! Samantha, you bitch!

283
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,803
- You like that?
- You bitch!

284
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,953
Turn it on, Trish.

285
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,209
Turn it on!

286
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:09,176
- Whoa!
- Hi. Rob Dyer. Sorry about that.

287
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,804
- Oh. Hello.
- Hi. What's your problem?

288
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:16,266
- No problem.
- I mean with the car.

289
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,645
Oh, the car. Um, it won't start.

290
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,105
Well, get in. Give it a crank.

291
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,358
Look, I've tried everything already.

292
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,735
The only thing it could be
is the solenoid.

293
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,030
If you had a screwdriver....

294
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,996
Okay, give it a crank.

295
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,463
You need a lift?

296
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,927
I didn't think anyone lived
this deep in the woods.

297
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,931
We do. What are you hunting
for up here?

298
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,601
Bear.
Anybody up at the lake today?

299
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,770
You can't be hunting for bear.

300
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,107
How about kids? There any kids,
vacationers, people like that?

301
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:10,195
Yeah. A bunch of kids moved in
yesterday. Right next door to us.

302
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,545
- This is it.
- Thanks for the lift.

303
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,722
Gordon!

304
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,851
Would you like to come in
for a minute?

305
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,644
I don't think I can.

306
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,438
Well, you gotta come in.

307
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,400
Come on, I got something real neat
to show you up in my bedroom.

308
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,946
Hi, Mom!

309
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,698
Tommy, who's your friend?

310
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,325
Mom, this is Rob.
Rob, this is my mother.

311
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,245
- Hello, Mrs....
- Jarvis.

312
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,945
Amazing.

313
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,167
Come here, I wanna
show you something.

314
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,740
<i>No way, not tonight</i>

315
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,951
<i>No way</i>

316
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,829
<i>Not today</i>

317
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,165
<i>Just 'cause you play it cool</i>

318
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,543
Would you care to dance?

319
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,255
- To this?
- It's good.

320
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,383
<i>All right</i>

321
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,926
Oh, well, good.

322
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,971
<i>Don't ask me to stay</i>

323
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:45,225
<i>Don't think you got it made
No, no</i>

324
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,311
<i>You're wrong</i>

325
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,317
<i>'Cause you can't fake it anymore</i>

326
00:35:55,778 --> 00:36:00,323
<i>I know what you're waiting for</i>

327
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:05,495
<i>I should turn away
And walk right out that door</i>

328
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,915
<i>Because I know--</i>

329
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,667
Hey, how come you
turned that off?

330
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,795
Relax, Jimbo.
You're gonna love this.

331
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,682
Wanna give Teddy bear a kiss?

332
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:36,151
Heh. Mm! Teddy. Teddy, uh--

333
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,029
I've gotta get another drink.

334
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,160
<i>With her eyes of night</i>

335
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:49,206
- Excuse me.
- You like this stuff?

336
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,083
You like slow dancing?

337
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,835
<i>Tangerine</i>

338
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,837
I could learn to.

339
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,549
Kiss me, you fool.

340
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,260
- Certainly.
- Ha, ha.

341
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,015
Uh, maybe we could dance to this one.

342
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,685
Come on, let Teddy bear
show you how it's done.

343
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,327
Stay near the trail.

344
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,413
- It goes all the way around the lake.
- Yeah, I will.

345
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,291
- There's only three of you up here?
- Mm-hm.

346
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,629
My parents have separated.
You know, middle-aged crazies. Heh.

347
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,882
I kind of hope they get back together.

348
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,427
Yeah, I hope so too.

349
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,395
- Looks like another rainy one, huh?
- Yeah.

350
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,814
Listen, if it gets too bad out there...

351
00:37:55,982 --> 00:38:00,193
...or if you wanna take a shower
or whatever, we're always home.

352
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:04,114
And if we're not,
Tommy usually leaves the door open.

353
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,206
- Good night.
- Take care.

354
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,301
Hey, how you doing with yours?

355
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,803
Nowhere, huh?

356
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,097
Check.

357
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:33,935
You gotta warm her up.
Watch me. Do what I do.

358
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:39,316
And, Jimbo, don't be
such a dead fuck.

359
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,236
I told you. I told you that
I didn't like that.

360
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,531
- Besides, you've got the hot one.
- Check.

361
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,494
- Hi.
- He thinks that's funny.

362
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,331
He thinks that's a funny
thing he's doing.

363
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,800
- Okay, you ready, Tina? On three.
- All right.

364
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,135
- One!
- One!

365
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,345
Two!

366
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,472
Three!

367
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,394
And the winner is...Tina!

368
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,480
All right!

369
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,652
What do I win?

370
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,613
What do you want?

371
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,741
Jimbo, put on another record.

372
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,662
Jimbo.

373
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,664
You don't mind, do you?

374
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,419
Actually, I was thinking
about taking a little swim.

375
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:44,881
It seems to be getting
a bit close in here for me.

376
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,301
- Sam....
- Sara. Sara, let's dance.

377
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,220
I don't wanna dance.

378
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,680
Well, let's mind our own business.

379
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,562
Look, I'll talk to Paul.

380
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,731
All right?

381
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,367
Mm.

382
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:35,306
- I wanna talk to you for a second.
- Man, I am going to kill him.

383
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,438
- I said I wanted to talk to you for a second.
- Not now, dead fuck.

384
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,067
That's what I wanted to
talk to you about.

385
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,403
Do you believe this guy?

386
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,908
- I mean, I had her. She was mine.
- Oh.

387
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,661
Well, you know what I suggest you do
about that, Teddy?

388
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,331
I think you should run that
through your little computer.

389
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,471
Paul?

390
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,230
I know you're out there, Paulie.

391
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,389
Paul?

392
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,275
Okay. Screw you, Paulie.

393
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,542
Come on, Paul.

394
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,006
I know you're out there.

395
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,887
Paul?

396
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,899
Screw you, Paul.

397
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,624
Look, what's the matter?

398
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,376
I can't go through with this.

399
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,920
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

400
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,867
<i>What good is a song</i>

401
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:26,037
<i>If words just don't belong?</i>

402
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,789
You wanna dance?

403
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,625
Yeah. Yeah.

404
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,961
<i>No good alone</i>

405
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,840
<i>To each his own</i>

406
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:42,178
<i>For me there's you</i>

407
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:46,140
<i>If a flame is to grow</i>

408
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:50,103
I thought that you wanted
to be with Ted.

409
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,231
Well, I did.

410
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,359
But now I wanna be with you.

411
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,533
That makes me feel like a rat.

412
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,954
<i>Two lips must insist</i>

413
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,207
<i>On two more to be kissed</i>

414
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,419
Well, do you wanna join them?

415
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,549
Jimmy.

416
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,010
Why don't we just go upstairs?

417
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,974
Upstairs. Heh.

418
00:45:56,628 --> 00:46:01,799
Ahem. That's a teddy bear.
Wanna give Teddy bear a kiss?

419
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,169
Fuck!

420
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,422
Shit.

421
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,535
Shit.

422
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,840
This is-- This is a neat room.

423
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,927
This is your room.

424
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:37,098
No. Actually, it's Paul's room.

425
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,685
You're neat.

426
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,114
- Oh, what a shock.
- Sorry.

427
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,495
Hey, you guys! Look what I found.

428
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,587
What is that?

429
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,307
God, what a pig!

430
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,169
Tina? We gotta go.

431
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,673
You go.

432
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,052
Tina, I'm gonna leave without you.

433
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,346
Take an umbrella.

434
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,469
You slut!

435
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,457
I'm going upstairs.

436
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,503
You tired?

437
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,089
No.

438
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,596
Do you mind sleeping
in the bottom bunk tonight?

439
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,601
Why, you wanna sleep on the top?

440
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,647
No.

441
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,367
Give me a few minutes.

442
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,246
Okay?

443
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,751
Good night, Teddy bear. Ha, ha.

444
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,503
Good night.

445
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,556
- Ha, ha.
- Stop.

446
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:12,229
Tommy? I'm gonna towel off
and then I'm gonna strangle you.

447
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,241
Tommy? Trish?

448
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,053
Anybody home?

449
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,652
Gordon?

450
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,279
Where's Tommy?

451
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,741
Gordon?

452
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,872
Where's Trish?

453
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:17,044
Matter of fact, where the hell are you?

454
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,016
Gordon?

455
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,066
Gordon?

456
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,243
Gordon?

457
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,419
Gordon?

458
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,811
Watch it!

459
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,942
Can we slow down a little?
The party's gonna go on all night.

460
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,779
I think I'm gonna lose my lollipop.

461
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:55,017
Mom, we're home.

462
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,647
Mom?

463
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:04,151
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

464
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,037
Mom?

465
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,140
Mom?

466
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:50,155
- She's not here.
- Maybe she's still jogging.

467
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:53,409
She's never gone this long.
And in the rain?

468
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,202
- I'm going out on the path.
- Me too.

469
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,204
No, you stay here
in case she comes back.

470
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,624
- I'll go!
- Stay here and fix the lights.

471
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:22,289
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What are you trying to do, kill me?

472
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,515
Tina? Ahem.

473
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,308
Hmm?

474
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,980
Never mind.

475
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,985
Tell me.

476
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,447
Um....

477
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,119
Did I...? Was, um...?

478
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,580
Was I...?

479
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,293
Was I a dead fuck?

480
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,756
- What?
- A dead fuck.

481
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,551
No.

482
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,807
You, uh--? You know what I think?

483
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,186
You know what I really think?

484
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,941
I think you were incredible.

485
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,663
- And I wanna do it again.
- Yeah.

486
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,209
Don't you move.
I'll be right back.

487
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,882
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

488
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,018
Check it out.

489
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:09,313
Why don't you run this through
your computer, Teddy bear?

490
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:15,152
Hey, congratulations, Jimbo.

491
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,488
Where's that bottle of wine?
Why don't we celebrate?

492
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:21,366
I think maybe I drank it.

493
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,079
I was great!

494
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,587
I was great. I was great.

495
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,506
Love, Teddy bear!

496
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:39,760
L-O-V-E.

497
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:43,930
Hey, Ted, where is...?
Where is that corkscrew?

498
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:47,434
That fancy corkscrew for
the wine bottle?

499
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,603
Ted?

500
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,191
Hey!

501
01:00:54,734 --> 01:01:00,113
Ted? Ted! Hey, Ted,
where the hell is the corkscrew?

502
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,790
Jimmy?

503
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:15,021
My sister Sandra was
a really great kid.

504
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,775
But the man that killed
your sister is dead.

505
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,319
No, he's alive.

506
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,614
Look.

507
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,910
Jason as a child, right?

508
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:32,873
Artist's conception of Jason as
described by a would-be victim, right?

509
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,584
And then the murders.

510
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,253
But he's dead.

511
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,215
Jason's body
has disappeared from the morgue.

512
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:46,511
- It was stolen.
- It was not stolen.

513
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:50,932
Two people at the hospital are missing.
This is coincidence?

514
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,186
He's alive.

515
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:59,524
Oh, my God. Tommy's at the house.

516
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,167
Ha, ha. Teddy.

517
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,379
Oh, man.

518
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,590
Oh.

519
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,720
Oh. Ha, ha.

520
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:09,195
So you wanna give the old
Teddy bear a kiss?

521
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,666
Jimbo?

522
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,669
Jimbo?

523
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:14,177
Sara, I think I'm in heaven.

524
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,432
I think I'm in love.

525
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,434
What?

526
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,897
I'll meet you in the bottom bunk.

527
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:42,455
<i>Tangerine, she is all they claim</i>

528
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,125
<i>With her eyes of night</i>

529
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:49,295
<i>And lips as bright as flame</i>

530
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:53,133
<i>Tangerine</i>

531
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:07,230
<i>Tangerine</i>

532
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,274
<i>She is</i>

533
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:14,612
Sara? Change your mind?

534
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:19,993
Come on. Get in here.

535
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,412
There's plenty of room.
We can sing a duet.

536
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,343
Who is it, Paulie?

537
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,305
Paulie.

538
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:44,476
Hey, Paulie, is that you?

539
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:50,648
Hey, Paulie. Whoops.
Dropped my bar of soap, old buddy.

540
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:53,276
Lucky you ain't in
here with me, old pal.

541
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,320
Ho-ho-ho.

542
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,442
I came to hear you sing.

543
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,907
So sing.

544
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:49,707
Aah! Sam! Samantha!

545
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:55,171
Sam! Sam! Sam!

546
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,882
Sam!

547
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,052
Sam! Sam!

548
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:34,711
Oh, Tommy. Thank God you're okay.

549
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,880
- Oh, Tommy.
- What happened?

550
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:39,632
- Where's Mom? Is she back?
- No, not yet.

551
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,051
I'm gonna call for help.

552
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,390
Rob, what's going on?

553
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,862
- I'm not getting anything.
- I wanna go next door.

554
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,238
- I'm going with you.
- No.

555
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:03,990
I'm going with you.

556
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:08,828
- You stay here and lock the door.
- Tommy, hold the fort.

557
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,914
Gordon!

558
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:44,781
- He's been here.
- Wait. What if he still is here?

559
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,575
Take this. Take it.

560
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:45,550
I'm going downstairs.
You stay right here with Gordon.

561
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:48,594
- No.
- Stay right here with Gordon.

562
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:45,651
Gordon.

563
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,170
Gordon!

564
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:06,964
Gordon?

565
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:53,070
Rob! Rob, he's here! He's here!

566
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:54,739
Rob! Rob!

567
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,285
Rob! Rob! Rob!

568
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:00,745
Rob, he's here!

569
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:04,415
- He's here. He's killed all of them, I know it.
- Oh, my God.

570
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:08,211
Shit. Give me a hand.

571
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:14,300
- Gotta get the knife.
- No! No.

572
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,052
No!

573
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:17,637
Oh, my God!

574
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:26,062
Oh, God, he's killing me!
He's killing me!

575
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:29,148
Run, Trish! Run! Trish!

576
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:36,489
Trish, run!

577
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:14,485
No! Get off me!

578
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:58,571
Tommy!

579
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,114
- All the doors locked?
- Yes.

580
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,116
Go get me a hammer
and nails right now.

581
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,285
- ls he here?
- Yes.

582
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:10,458
Tommy, hurry!

583
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:59,882
Help me! Help me!

584
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:04,845
Help me! Help me!
Let me go!

585
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,849
Help me! Put me down!
Put me down!

586
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:29,120
Tommy, help me push this.

587
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,346
Where is he?

588
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:13,456
What's he doing?
What's he doing?

589
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:05,382
Listen, Tommy,
I'm gonna get him out of the house.

590
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:08,260
And when I do, I want you
to run like hell, do you hear me?

591
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:11,180
Run like hell, okay?

592
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:41,043
Oh, my God!

593
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,092
- Trish!
- Tommy, no!

594
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,848
Trish!

595
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,492
Trish!

596
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,703
Tommy?

597
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:42,831
Tommy, you were supposed to leave!

598
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:16,365
Tommy! Tommy, get the hell out of here!

599
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:17,783
No!

600
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:20,244
You son of a bitch.

601
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,831
I'm gonna give you something
to remember us by.

602
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:43,142
Jason!

603
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,812
Jason!

604
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:08,000
Remember me, Jason?

605
01:24:08,793 --> 01:24:11,045
Jason, don't you remember?

606
01:24:12,338 --> 01:24:14,548
Remember, Jason?

607
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:18,844
Jason, remember?

608
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:22,973
Remember?

609
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:46,598
Tommy.

610
01:26:06,452 --> 01:26:07,703
Tommy!

611
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:18,422
Tommy!

612
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:22,593
Tommy!

613
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,849
Die!

614
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:32,895
- Die!
- Tommy!

615
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:35,355
Die!

616
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:39,484
- Tommy!
- Die!

617
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:44,865
The shoulder will need some surgery.

618
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:48,076
But we can wait
till she's a better candidate.

619
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:51,830
Now, you just get a good rest,
young lady.

620
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:53,874
You haven't answered my question.

621
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:56,293
Neither one of you
is answering my question.

622
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,171
Often, during extreme duress,
people are capable...

623
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:01,340
...of extraordinary behavior.

624
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:05,302
That's what happened when your
brother violently attacked the killer.

625
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:10,224
At that moment it was perfectly normal
for him to act to protect himself.

626
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,142
He's going to be just fine.

627
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:15,312
But right now, what you need is rest.

628
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:19,858
Can I see my brother now?

629
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:23,528
Sure. But only for a minute.

630
01:27:23,696 --> 01:27:25,697
I'll send him in.

631
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,424
Tommy.

632
01:27:45,305 --> 01:28:45,388
