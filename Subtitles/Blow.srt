2
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,087
That's a nice boy.

3
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,214
Go get him, Dulli.

4
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,342
Get in.

5
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,476
- We good?
- Oh, yeah.

6
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,396
Are we good? Yeah, we're good.
We're beautiful.

7
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,231
We're perfect.

8
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:15,485
This is Grade A, 100-percent pure
Colombian cocaine, ladies and gentlemen.

9
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,154
Disco shit.

10
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,781
Pure as the driven snow.

11
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,950
My name is George Jung...

12
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:26,121
...federal inmate number 19225004.

13
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,125
I was born in New England.

14
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,170
Massachusetts, actually,
in a town called Weymouth.

15
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,965
That's me.
And that's my best friend, Tuna.

16
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,052
My dad ran a plumbing
and heating company.

17
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,889
He had three trucks, 10 employees
and did big jobs.

18
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,474
- Hey.
He was my hero.

19
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,267
- Did you do it?
- Yeah, I didn't fall once.

20
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,646
Attaboy. See you tonight.
- Can I please come to work with you?

21
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,315
Hey, come on, Fred. Let's go, huh?
Say goodbye to the kid.

22
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,775
Clam it, Bill.

23
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,528
I'll talk to my boy as long as I want to.
You got a problem with that?

24
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,035
You really wanna come?

25
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,997
Oh, what the heck? All right.

26
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,085
- All right, get your boots.
Thanks, Dad. Thanks.

27
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,004
Bill, what's your problem?

28
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,924
Guess who's on cleanup today.
And buying lunch.

29
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,802
Money! M-O-N-E-Y.

30
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,972
Dad was a hard worker,
but didn't make enough to keep Mom happy.

31
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,473
Why do you think I married you?

32
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,976
She'd thought she'd married
above her class.

33
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,436
And he'd promised her the moon
but didn't deliver.

34
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,814
- How we will live?
The truth was...

35
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,691
...business got slow and we were broke.

36
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,193
Don't you touch me!
Look at your hands. You're disgusting.

37
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,863
Please, not in front of the boy.
The boy. What about me, Fred?

38
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,658
Mom, wait, where are you going?
- Go home, George!

39
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,326
Mom, where are you going?

40
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,996
No matter how many times
my mother would leave...

41
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,581
...no matter how many times
she embarrassed him...

42
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,333
Mom!

43
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,212
...he always took her back.

44
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,381
He loved her.

45
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,049
God, he loved her.

46
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,926
Ermine.

47
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,305
Come here.

48
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,307
- Are you okay?
Yeah.

49
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,850
You all right?
Yeah.

50
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,147
Hi, George.

51
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,898
I'm home.

52
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,067
Come on, give me a hug.

53
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,033
Come on, Georgie.

54
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,076
Come to Mommy.

55
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,704
George.

56
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,415
Come give your mother a hug.

57
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,091
For 10 years...

58
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,679
...my father worked his ass off
14 hours a day, seven days a week.

59
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,766
He didn't care,
as long as we were happy.

60
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,393
Okay, well, what do I have to do?

61
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,438
But in the end, he didn't make enough...

62
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,941
...slowly but surely lost everything.

63
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,902
We were bankrupt.

64
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,029
Let's get some ice cream.

65
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,448
No, Dad,
I don't care about ice cream right now.

66
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,283
What are we gonna do?

67
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,160
It'll be all right, George.

68
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,746
It'll work out. It always does.

69
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,706
I'm gonna find another job.

70
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,459
Look, George, this is the way it goes.

71
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,753
Sometimes you're flush
and sometimes you're bust.

72
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,963
And when you're up,
it's never as good as it seems.

73
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,633
And when you're down,
you never think you're gonna be up again.

74
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,178
But life goes on. Remember that.

75
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,764
Money isn't real, George.

76
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,433
It doesn't matter.
It only seems like it does.

77
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,602
Yeah, tell that to Mom.

78
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,940
Yeah. That's gonna be a tricky one.

79
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,526
- Hey, Dad.
- What?

80
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,987
Are we gonna be poor?
Because I don't ever wanna be poor.

81
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,657
Then you won't.

82
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,703
I decided right then and there
I wasn't gonna live like that.

83
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,332
I needed to get as far away as possible.

84
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,883
I moved to California
in the summer of 1968 with the Tuna.

85
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,011
We had $300 and a black TR3.

86
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:14,516
Sure was nothing like this back home.
It was paradise.

87
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,687
We got a small one-bedroom apartment
right on the beach.

88
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,232
It wasn't much, but it had its perks.

89
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,446
George.

90
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,197
George?

91
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,702
You need some help?

92
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,712
California was like nothing
I'd ever seen before.

93
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,547
Hey, where's the beer?

94
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,633
People were liberated,
independent, full of new ideas.

95
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,135
Hi, George, Tuna.

96
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,222
They used words like
"right on," "groovy," "solid."

97
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,224
The women were beautiful.

98
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,562
And they all seemed
to share the same occupation.

99
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,483
- I'm a stewardess.
- I'm a stewardess.

100
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,942
Yeah.

101
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,986
On the airplane.

102
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,282
And everyone was getting stoned.

103
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,114
Hi.
- Hello. Hi. Hello.

104
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,783
Hey, Tuna.

105
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,951
Hi.

106
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,537
Oh, my God.

107
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,835
I figured it out.

108
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,462
Figured out what?

109
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,382
You know how we were wondering
what we were gonna do for money...

110
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,008
...being as we don't wanna get jobs?

111
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,969
Yeah.
- Check this out.

112
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,935
Oregano?

113
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,813
- Tuna, this is crap.
Look, we're selling it.

114
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,440
We'll make up three-finger lids
and sell them on the beach.

115
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,819
If we move that, we got, like...
Like, a hundred bucks.

116
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,446
And if we don't, well, we can smoke it.

117
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,031
You got ripped off, pal.

118
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,118
It's not a bad idea, man.
I got the baggies and everything.

119
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,997
Look, if you really wanna score some dope,
I got the guy.

120
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:47,168
The guy was Derek Foreal,
a Manhattan Beach legend.

121
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,589
He owned three restaurants, two nightclubs,
and chain of Laundromats.

122
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:55,594
But more importantly, he owned the first
male hair salon in all of southern California.

123
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,928
Barbie.

124
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,847
- Hey.
- Mwah.

125
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,016
Maria.

126
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,517
Mwah, mwah.

127
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,727
Hey.

128
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,978
Hey, Sandy.

129
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,939
Ah, so this is the new man, huh?
He's cute.

130
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,984
George.

131
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,361
Tuna.

132
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,488
Hello, Tuna.

133
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,283
EnchantÃ©, George.

134
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,413
Barbie, he is yummy.

135
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,373
He looks just like a Ken doll.

136
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:30,712
Huh! Ken and Barbie.
Oh, my God, it is so perfect.

137
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:36,259
Girls, give me about five minutes.
I wanna talk alone to the boys.

138
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,137
Have fun.
- Gentlemen?

139
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,353
All right, everybody, shoo. Come on.

140
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,648
Chop, chop. Give us a few minutes.
Chop, chop, chop.

141
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,232
Go blond, Ron.

142
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,693
Very nice, Heather.

143
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,157
Now what can I do for you, guys?

144
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,871
We'd like to buy some pot.

145
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,291
I know what you want.

146
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,087
- But first, are you cops?
No.

147
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,590
If you are, you have to tell me.
If not, it's entrapment.

148
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,843
We're not cops.
We're from Massachusetts.

149
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,763
Does he look like a cop?

150
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,724
Actually, no.

151
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,979
You know, it's a good thing
you're friends of Barbie's.

152
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,940
Because if you weren't...

153
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,236
...I would never talk to you.

154
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,286
What the fuck is that?

155
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,997
It's your pot.

156
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,624
Wow.

157
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,793
That's more than we had in mind.

158
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,421
I don't nickel-and-dime.
You want it or not?

159
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,423
We'll take it.

160
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,606
Tuna and I became the kings
of Manhattan Beach.

161
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,485
If you bought grass,
you bought it from us.

162
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,573
The bills were paid and I was making
way more money than I could at a real job.

163
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,659
I built a reputation for myself.

164
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:29,164
People even started calling me
"Boston George."

165
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,332
It was perfect.

166
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,338
This is it for me.

167
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,799
What is it?

168
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,676
Everything.

169
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,263
You, California, the beach.

170
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,640
This spot right here.

171
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,853
I just finally feel like I belong somewhere,
you know?

172
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,938
I feel right.

173
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,358
You're happy.

174
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,861
Yeah, I am.

175
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,863
You?

176
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,783
Um, mm-hm.

177
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,327
Good.

178
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,963
Look what the cat dragged in.

179
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,382
Holy shit, Dulli.

180
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,093
George.
- Hey.

181
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,223
Man.
- What the fuck are you doing out here?

182
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,683
Man, I'll tell you.
I was walking down the beach.

183
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:34,854
I was minding my business, right?
Who do I see? This fucking guy.

184
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,650
- I didn't know you were in California.
- What are you doing out here?

185
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,026
On vacation, man.

186
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,028
I'm on my way back to school.

187
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,156
Oh. Well, this calls for a joint.
You wanna do the honors?

188
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,741
No, man.

189
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,410
- I'm too fucked up.
- That's nice weed, huh?

190
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,912
Fuck, yeah.

191
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,207
I've never seen anything like this.
I'm fucking wasted.

192
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,000
Right on.

193
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,296
Man.

194
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:07,095
I'm fucking stoned.

195
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,932
I'm fucking really stoned.

196
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,226
I'm fucking stoned, man. I'm really...

197
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,854
Stoned?

198
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,566
- Yeah, ha, ha.
- Yeah.

199
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:23,278
Man, I wish there was stuff like this
back at home.

200
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,487
Yeah?

201
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:28,700
Fuck, yeah. You know how much money
you can make with this stuff back east?

202
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,035
- Yeah?
No shit, Kev?

203
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,121
- That's right.
Yeah?

204
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,540
When there's stuff to move,
it's too easy not to.

205
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,793
Do you know how many colleges there are
within a 60-mile radius?

206
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,338
- UMASS, Amherst, BU.
Smith, Hampshire.

207
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,007
And Holyoke.
Holyoke.

208
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,385
There's 100,000 rich kids
with their parents' money to spend.

209
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,179
There's never anything around.
Nothing good, anyways.

210
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,433
I'm spending 400 bucks on shit.

211
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,934
Yeah?

212
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,022
The way I figure it...

213
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,649
...Barbara flies back east twice a week.

214
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,484
Two bags per flight.

215
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,486
Twenty-five pounds in each bag.

216
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,280
That's a hundred pounds a week.

217
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,534
I know it's a lot of weight,
but you can't get pot like this back home.

218
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,289
I'm telling you, Derek, it'll sell.

219
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,333
I don't know.

220
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,460
The best pot...

221
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,587
...you can charge 500 a pound.

222
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,048
Come on, George.
No one's gonna pay that.

223
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:29,218
It's already been negotiated. It's done.
The money's there waiting.

224
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,012
Goodness.

225
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,056
Goodness is right.

226
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,017
Listen...

227
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,480
...I want you to be my partner
on this thing, Derek.

228
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,940
Fifty-fifty.

229
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,693
If you do the math,
that's over 30 grand a week profit.

230
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,821
That's $15,000 a week for you,
my friend.

231
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,033
In your pocket, free and clear.

232
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,576
And I just deal with you.

233
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,287
Barbara and me. No one else.

234
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,873
It's gonna work, Derek.

235
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:05,129
I don't know. East Coast, airplanes.

236
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,382
I'm paranoid. It seems really risky.

237
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,467
Derek, she's a stewardess.

238
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,053
They don't check her bags.

239
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,858
- Bye, dear.
- Bye.

240
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,576
There she is.

241
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,205
- Hey, Barbara.
- Kevin.

242
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,924
See this suit? Japanese.

243
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,096
See you.
Bye.

244
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,305
Barbara.
- Kevin.

245
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,016
How've you been?
- Hey.

246
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,435
More. I need more.

247
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,986
Bye.
Barbara. Hey.

248
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,946
- Hey, Kevin.
- I need more.

249
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,614
I need more.

250
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,199
What do you want me to do?

251
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,327
I can only carry two bags
and I can't fly back here every day.

252
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:22,248
I know. I got a feeding frenzy on my hands.
You tell George this is small potatoes.

253
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,169
We're missing out on some serious cash.
You tell George. He'll think of something.

254
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,628
- I will.
- Good.

255
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,653
Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Dulli.

256
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,156
Twenty, 40, 60, 80, nine...

257
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,408
Twenty, 40, 60, 80. A thousand.

258
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,368
Hundred twenty-eight thousand dollars.

259
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:03,289
Jesus Christ,
I'm getting a boner just looking at her.

260
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,999
You believe it, George?

261
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,712
What's the matter, George?
Something wrong?

262
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,883
Man, cheer up. I mean, half of this is ours.
We're fucking rich.

263
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,511
- It's not enough.
- What?

264
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,387
The fuck are you talking about?

265
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,931
Setup is wrong.

266
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,184
We're doing all the legwork.
At the end of the day, we're paying retail.

267
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,394
- We're getting fucking middled.
So?

268
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,230
So we need to get to the source.

269
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,190
Source? What about Derek?

270
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,650
He's getting middled too.

271
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,568
And Derek's our partner.

272
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,029
What's good for him is good for us.

273
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,865
So we need a source.

274
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,742
Where do we start?

275
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,498
Either one of you guys speak Spanish?

276
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,300
Tuna! Get the fuck in there!

277
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,802
Go on and play.

278
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,181
Yeah!

279
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,230
Cheers.

280
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,233
CÃ³mo, marijuana?

281
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,403
Smoking? Smoke them?

282
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,572
Do you have some pot?

283
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,908
DÃ³nde estÃ¡pot?

284
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,411
- Do you know where we can get pot?
- No. No idea.

285
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,205
El weed.

286
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,250
Where we can find some marijuana?
We're looking for marijuana.

287
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,921
Take a little off the top.
You know what I mean?

288
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,507
Smoke, man. Marijuana?
Excuse me, do you smoke?

289
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,929
So you got anything?

290
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,639
I haven't asked.
What?

291
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,100
I didn't ask yet. Go ahead.

292
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,814
Hey, George.

293
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,357
Come on.

294
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,154
We'll be back.
Okay.

295
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,050
Santiago?

296
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,984
George.

297
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,620
Ramon tells me
you're looking for some mota.

298
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,497
Yeah, I am.

299
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,464
For instance, say, something like this, eh?

300
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,592
Ahem. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that'll do it.

301
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,636
I'll take it.

302
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,184
You're funny.

303
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,435
Really.

304
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,562
How much will you be needing?

305
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,023
All of it.

306
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,193
Yeah, I'll come back in a week
with a plane.

307
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,241
Maybe we're going too fast.

308
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,536
You take a little and then come back.

309
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,707
Yeah, but I don't need a little.
I need a lot.

310
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,426
Hang on a minute. Hang on. Hang on.
Listen, seÃ±or.

311
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,219
Tell you what, amigo.

312
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,305
What about I come back...

313
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,515
...and I bring you, say...

314
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,309
...fifty thousand dollars?

315
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,228
That alleviate some of your concerns?

316
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,604
Amigo...

317
00:21:55,772 --> 00:22:00,318
...you bring me $50,000
and I have no more concerns.

318
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,865
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.

319
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,325
Don't be such a pussy.

320
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,869
We're not fucking stealing it.
We're borrowing it.

321
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,663
Oops. Be cool, boys.
Got a little company here.

322
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,381
Smoke.
Come on, let's go. Tuna?

323
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,925
Let's go. Tuna.

324
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,471
- Good luck, boys. I'll see you in the desert.
All right.

325
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,432
- You sure you know what you're doing?
Relax, all right?

326
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,559
I've flown with my old man
a million times.

327
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,355
It's not the, ahh, taking-off part
you got to worry about. It's the landing.

328
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,190
Okay.

329
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,268
Hi. How are you?
- Good to see you.

330
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,062
You are a man of your word.

331
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,107
Oh, listen,
you know the 50,000 I promised you?

332
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,276
Couldn't get it.

333
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,073
So I brought you 75 instead.

334
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:50,553
George! Whoo!

335
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,891
George.

336
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,435
Merry Christmas, Derek.

337
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,438
Merry Christmas.

338
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,192
It's beautiful.

339
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,490
You're a genius, George.

340
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,826
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

341
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,371
This would make a fabulous
Christmas card.

342
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,039
Get my camera, Sven.

343
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,419
George!

344
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,212
Did you see the bedroom?

345
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,215
I love it. It's so pretty.

346
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,217
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, I saw it.

347
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,427
Hi.
- Hi.

348
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,387
Oh, my God.
- What do you think?

349
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,555
Are you kidding?

350
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,223
- Yeah, you want it?
- Mm-hm.

351
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,184
- We'll take it.
- All right.

352
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,658
It was a great time in our lives.

353
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,535
The seven of us were like a family.

354
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,414
We worked hard, we played hard,
didn't have a care in the world.

355
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,541
Egg roll!

356
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,460
It was perfect.

357
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,399
I can't get over
the size of that ring. I just love it.

358
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,944
Look at it, Fred.
Tell me you don't love that ring.

359
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,446
I'm happy that George
has found somebody he cares for.

360
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,282
Yes, of course.
But I'm talking about the ring.

361
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,992
It's something else, let me tell you.

362
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,661
George has exquisite taste.

363
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,622
What is it? Two carats?
It's gotta be at least two carats.

364
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,999
I don't know.
- Yes, it's definitely two carats.

365
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,209
Treasure it, darling.

366
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,754
- George, you might wanna get that insured.
- Okay, Mom.

367
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,591
Hard to imagine being able to afford a ring
like that on a construction salary.

368
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:57,429
Oh, shut up, Fred. Shut your big fat mouth.
You don't buy it all at once.

369
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,306
It's called layaway.

370
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,141
- Layaway, shmayaway.
- Yes, layaway.

371
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,644
Something you wouldn't know
anything about, cheapskate.

372
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,605
Cheapskate, beapskate.
- Yeah, you, you big old tightwad.

373
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,649
He still has his Communion money.

374
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,693
- Don't listen to her.
- George, tell your father...

375
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,820
Yap, yap, yap.

376
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,156
George, you tell your father
about layaway.

377
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,659
- Layaway.
- Okay.

378
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,328
The boy's happy, Fred.
Don't be such a killjoy.

379
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,163
I'm not a killjoy.

380
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,498
Oh, Jesus. Babe.

381
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,708
- Put your head back.
- Ahh!

382
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,627
Put your head back.
- Why, Barbara.

383
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,255
My God.
Here, take my napkin.

384
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,048
Is she all right?
- Yeah.

385
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,302
- I'll get you ice. Irene, we need ice here.
- Yeah, she's all right.

386
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,554
- You know what? You wanna go?
- Yeah, let's go.

387
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:42,683
- Oh, come on. You haven't had your entrÃ©e.
- No, it's okay. It's better.

388
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,184
George...
- I'll leave the tip.

389
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,020
- George, no.
- Hope you feel better.

390
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,354
It was lovely to meet you.

391
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,649
- Give your mother a call in the morning.
Okay, Mom.

392
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,945
What a lovely girl.

393
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,032
- Is that all hundreds?
- Yeah.

394
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,037
Are you sure you're all right?

395
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,622
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

396
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,042
Honey, would you be bummed out
if I didn't go to Chicago with you?

397
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,378
No, not if you don't wanna.

398
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,841
Listen, I gotta apologize about my parents.
That was...

399
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,218
They weren't that bad.
They were kind of cute.

400
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,388
I'm not sure about that.

401
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,850
I want you to promise me something.

402
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,145
I want you to promise me
that we're never gonna be like that.

403
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,065
I don't wanna wind up like them.

404
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,152
We're gonna wind up like us.

405
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,030
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

406
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,242
- I love you.
- In the car.

407
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,204
Hurry before they come out.

408
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,921
George Jung,
you stand accused of...

409
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:59,176
...possession of 660 pounds of marijuana
with intent to distribute.

410
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,678
How do you plead?

411
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,058
Your Honor, I'd like to say a few words
to the court, if I may?

412
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,561
You're gonna have to stop slouching
and stand up to address this court, sir.

413
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,271
All right. Fine.

414
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,898
Well...

415
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,275
...in all honesty...

416
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,736
...I don't feel that what I've done
is a crime.

417
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:22,199
And I think it's illogical and irresponsible
for you to sentence me to prison.

418
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,868
Because when you think about it,
what did I really do?

419
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,913
I crossed an imaginary line
with a bunch of plants.

420
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,332
I mean, "You say I'm an outlaw.
You say I'm a thief.

421
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,420
But where's the Christmas dinner
for the people on relief, huh?

422
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,089
You say you're looking for someone
who's never weak but always strong...

423
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,508
...to gather flowers constantly,
whether you were right or wrong...

424
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,303
...someone to open each and every door,
but it ain't me, babe, huh?

425
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,224
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe."

426
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,559
You follow?

427
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,144
Yeah.

428
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:55,441
Gosh, you know, your concepts
are really interesting, Mr. Jung.

429
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,484
Thank you.

430
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,320
Unfortunately for you,
the line you crossed was real...

431
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:05,784
...and the plants you brought with you
were illegal, so your bail is $20,000.

432
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,745
Next case, Your Honor.

433
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,830
- Number 14173.
- No.

434
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,802
George.

435
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,346
- George.
- Hey, babe.

436
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,182
What are you doing here?

437
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,101
Surprise.

438
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,937
You didn't have to come
all the way out here, babe.

439
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,898
What, and miss all the fun?

440
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,316
Not a chance.

441
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,693
So...

442
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,070
...what's the verdict?

443
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,574
The lawyer says he can, uh...

444
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,243
...plead it down to five years.

445
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,329
I'll serve two.

446
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,833
- Two years.
- Yeah.

447
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,543
Two years.

448
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,546
George, I can't wait that long.

449
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,760
What, are you kidding me?
You're not gonna wait for me? Fuck is that?

450
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,639
I...

451
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,974
I don't have two years.

452
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,686
What?

453
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,825
No.

454
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:36,268
Losing Barbara to cancer
changed everything.

455
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,479
The old gang broke up.

456
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:43,483
Tuna stayed in Mexico.
God only knows what happened to him.

457
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,320
Point is, we all lost touch.

458
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,740
I'd skipped bail in Chicago
to take care of Barbara...

459
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,659
...and was now a fugitive on the run.

460
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:57,331
It'd been almost a year
since I'd seen my parents.

461
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,500
And believe it or not,
I actually missed them.

462
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,469
Hi, Ma.

463
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,558
Surprised to see me?

464
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,604
Take off your boots.

465
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,076
You're tan.

466
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,953
Mexico.

467
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,539
Yeah, I heard about it.

468
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,546
I want you to know...

469
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,466
...I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.

470
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,679
- Barbara?
- Yeah, Barbara.

471
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,472
Nice girl.

472
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,891
Thank you.

473
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,487
Have you been getting the money
I send you?

474
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,407
What, you mean the drug money?

475
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,576
Yeah, I got it.

476
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,292
Oh, God.

477
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,385
What are you doing, huh?
What are you doing?

478
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,054
It's okay, Mom.
George?

479
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,431
It's okay, Mom.

480
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,099
Georgie.
- Hi, Pop.

481
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,852
George, I thought I heard something.
How are you?

482
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,603
- How are you?
Good.

483
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,480
Oh, son, come on in.

484
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,941
How are you? You look good.

485
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,618
May the wind always be at your back...

486
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,287
...and the sun upon your face.

487
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,789
And may the winds of destiny
carry you aloft...

488
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,624
...to dance with the stars.

489
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,294
- Cheers, Georgie.
- Cheers, Pop.

490
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,976
Are you all right?

491
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,940
Just low, you know?

492
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,109
You really loved her.

493
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,739
Yeah, Dad.

494
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,783
I really did.

495
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,125
Are you mad at me?

496
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,504
Uh-uh. No.

497
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,255
- Yeah, you are.
- No.

498
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,717
- I can tell by the way you're looking at me.
- I'm not mad, George.

499
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,513
I just don't understand
what you're doing.

500
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,975
I don't understand your choices. You know,
the goddamn cops are looking for you.

501
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,353
I know.

502
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,532
I'm great at what I do, Dad.

503
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,952
I mean, I'm really great at what I do.

504
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,374
Let me tell you something, George.

505
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,544
You'd have been great at anything.

506
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,212
Anything.

507
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,723
Fuck. Damn.

508
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,684
George!

509
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,395
Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

510
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,040
I had no choice.

511
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,087
Don't look at me like that.

512
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,755
Let's go.

513
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,091
- What? What was I supposed to do?
- Jesus Christ, Ermine.

514
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,885
- He's in our house!
- Shut up. Shut up.

515
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,596
What, was I supposed to be
an accomplice?

516
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:27,100
You don't think people know
you're a drug dealer?

517
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,854
Everyone knows you're a drug dealer.
It's no secret.

518
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,523
How do you think that reflects on me?

519
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,610
Every time I go out, I'm humiliated.

520
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,864
So you go to jail. It's for your own good.

521
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,159
You need to straighten your life out!

522
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,669
What are you looking at, Mrs. Gracie?
Your son's no prize.

523
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,139
Stop.

524
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,141
Open up Cell Number 3!

525
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,522
Prisoner is in.

526
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,067
Close Cell Number 3.

527
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,120
Hello. My name is Diego Delgado.
How do you do?

528
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,623
Okay.

529
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,253
Hey, George.
What?

530
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,588
If you don't mind me asking...

531
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,341
...what is the reason
you are in this place?

532
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,803
I don't wanna talk about it.

533
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,515
Oh, come on, George.

534
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,769
If we are to be friends,
we must trust each other.

535
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,648
- I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Me too, yeah.

536
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,360
Too much blah-blah-blah. You know?

537
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,779
But we are roommates.

538
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,698
And we must talk to each other.

539
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,703
I'm arrested for stealing cars.

540
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,039
For the grand theft auto.

541
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:23,550
Murder.

542
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,273
What do you got down there, Diego?

543
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:42,235
Nothing. Just a little project.

544
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,572
What kind of little project?

545
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,784
Never mind.

546
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,995
Not for you to worry.

547
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,750
Come on. I thought you said
we're supposed to be roommates...

548
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,085
...tell each other everything,
all that kind of shit.

549
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,337
Uh-huh.

550
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,590
You have your intrigues, I have mine.

551
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,512
Today is a happy day for me, George.

552
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,641
In nine months from today,
I'll be in Medellin, sipping champagne.

553
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,477
In nine months...

554
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,228
...I'm free.

555
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,107
I'm happy for you.

556
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,777
Yeah.

557
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,279
How much time do you have?

558
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,282
Oh, let's see.

559
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,620
Twenty-six months.

560
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,084
Twenty-six months?

561
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,294
For murder?

562
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,716
I must meet your lawyer.

563
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,553
I gotta get out of here, Diego.

564
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,310
Only two ways I know
to leave here early.

565
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,021
One...

566
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,898
...is to escape.

567
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,570
Okay, what's the other?

568
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,659
Uh...
I guess we ought to open our books.

569
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,870
Man, fuck you.
We ain't opening shit.

570
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,832
That's right.
You're the warden's little bitch.

571
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,835
We're hip to you.
Doing that shit to get some time cut off.

572
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,087
What the fuck? Why not?

573
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,465
Listen, I wanna get out of this shithole
as quickly as fucking possible.

574
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:31,845
But for me to walk early,
some of you has got to graduate.

575
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,222
You should forget it. You're hopeless.
Go to sleep.

576
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,225
Fuck you. See you in the shower.

577
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,435
Jive-ass turkey.

578
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,062
The rest of you guys
might be able to get diplomas...

579
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,523
...and get jobs when you get back
on the outside.

580
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,316
Shit, I'm in this bitch for life.

581
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:49,362
Motherfucker, I'm a criminal.
Ain't nobody giving me no fucking job.

582
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,614
Well...

583
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,534
...let's learn some criminal shit too.

584
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,454
Tell you what, I'll make you a deal.

585
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,374
What about half the time I teach you
about this George Washington character...

586
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,543
...the other half...

587
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,545
...I'll teach you how to smuggle drugs.

588
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,715
You don't know dick
about smuggling no drugs.

589
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,425
Oh, no?

590
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:14,137
I was arrested in Chicago
with 660 pounds of grass.

591
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,389
I think that qualifies me.

592
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,267
How'd the fuck you get
660 pounds of weed?

593
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,854
Flew in from Mexico
on a single-engine Cessna.

594
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,231
So we got a deal or what?

595
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,233
Hey, George.

596
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,528
George.

597
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,238
What?

598
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,743
I listened to what you say
to the class today about the smuggling.

599
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,621
Never believed you were a murderer.

600
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,749
I knew you were a mÃ¡gico.

601
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,752
I'm tired, Diego. Go to bed.

602
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,797
Do you know in my country
I'm a mÃ¡gico?

603
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,674
A man with a dream.

604
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,968
A man on the rise.

605
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,764
To take nothing and make it something.

606
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,807
Do you have a dream, George?

607
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,060
Well, I would if I could get
some fucking sleep.

608
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,605
You have a dream.

609
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,651
And maybe you will accomplish it.

610
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,070
But yet you failed.

611
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,696
Why?

612
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,950
- Because I got caught.
- No.

613
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,160
You failed...

614
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,956
...because you had the wrong dream.

615
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,546
George?

616
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,509
What do you know about cocaine?

617
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,055
First of all,
what type of planes do you have?

618
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:43,643
They're, uh, four-passenger,
single-engine Cessnas.

619
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,311
Four passengers.

620
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,480
So that means...

621
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,900
...how many kilos can we fit
in these planes?

622
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,653
I don't know. Probably, uh, 100, 150...

623
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,905
Danbury wasn't a prison.

624
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,324
It was a crime school.

625
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,160
I went in with a bachelor of marijuana...

626
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,247
...came out with a doctorate of cocaine.

627
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:09,836
And after 16 months,
I was once again a free man.

628
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,965
Well, not altogether free.
The conditions of my parole...

629
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,260
...were that I had to live
at my parents' house and find a job.

630
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,470
Hello.
- Diego Delgado, please.

631
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,057
- Diego, George.
Boston George.

632
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,019
- Today is the day. Are you out?
- Yeah, I'm out.

633
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,187
Congratulations.
I've been waiting for you.

634
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,064
- How we doing?
Fine.

635
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,900
Everything's perfect down here.
Everything is all set up.

636
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,570
Do we need a plane?
How does this work? When do I see you?

637
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,031
Slow down, Georgie.
You need to come down here.

638
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,533
Everybody meets everybody.

639
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,370
We do one for good faith
and then we talk about airplanes, okay?

640
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,372
- I can't go anyway, Diego.
- Georgie.

641
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,459
- It's nice and cold.
- All right, Pop. One minute.

642
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,461
I'm on parole. I can't leave the state.

643
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,340
But, George, you'll be back
before they know you're gone.

644
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,050
I just got released five minutes ago...

645
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:00,637
George, are we gonna do this or not?

646
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,938
- My friend.
Hey. How are you?

647
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:13,441
- Fine.
- Good to see you.

648
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,152
Okay.

649
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,904
Fifteen kilos it is then, okay?

650
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,909
We receive $100,000 upon delivery.

651
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,579
Not so fast. No, no, no.
I would like to go over the details.

652
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,251
What details?

653
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:36,464
I put the coke in the false bottoms
and I take it through customs.

654
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,007
That's it.

655
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,552
Tell me about the suitcases.

656
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,056
- Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
- What?

657
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,933
Clothes.

658
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,185
In the suitcase.

659
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,273
Yeah, okay.

660
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,110
Okay, yeah.

661
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,403
Let's try it. Why not?

662
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,363
Yeah, whose clothes? Your clothes?

663
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,454
Okay. Ahem. Diego?
What the fuck is going on here?

664
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:09,956
The guy's talking about clothes.

665
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,625
You pulled me all the way down here
to talk about clothes?

666
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,419
I demand to know everything.

667
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,463
I do not trust $600,000 worth of coca
to someone I don't know.

668
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:20,466
It's 15 fucking kilos. I piss 15 kilos.

669
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,427
- Hey, hey, hey.
I'm an amateur, huh?

670
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,053
Gentlemen, please, hey.

671
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,473
There's not need to be impolite, okay?

672
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,766
Hey.

673
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,309
Cesar?

674
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,401
George, Cesar is just being thorough.

675
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,903
And that's all, okay?

676
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,076
Okay, very well.

677
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:51,330
But just remember, Mr. Jung,
I will be with you the whole way...

678
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,832
...and I will be watching.

679
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,154
When you're carrying drugs
across the border...

680
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,782
...the idea is to remain calm.

681
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,202
The way I do it
is to think of something pleasant.

682
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:34,123
A fun party, a moment of triumph,
sexual encounter.

683
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,709
I actually project myself to that place.

684
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:40,213
A little transcendental meditation,
if you will.

685
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,216
The trick is to imagine every little detail.

686
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:47,845
Anything to keep your mind off the fact that
you're going to jail for a very long time...

687
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,932
...if they find the 15 kilos of blow
in your suitcases.

688
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,892
Passport, please?

689
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,562
- Nice flight?
Yeah, it was pretty good. Thanks.

690
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,733
On vacation?
- Yes.

691
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,028
On vacation for only one day.

692
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,824
Oh, yeah. My brother's wedding.

693
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,368
It was a nice ceremony and everything.
It was good.

694
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,162
Open your bag, please?

695
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,250
Sure.

696
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,510
Whose clothes are these?
- Mine.

697
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,595
And these?

698
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,059
Old habits, you know. Hard to break.

699
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,438
Close it up.

700
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,941
Yes, sir.

701
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,545
The trial period was over.

702
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,299
It was time to start moving
some serious weight.

703
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,135
Commercial flights weren't gonna cut it
anymore.

704
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,304
What we needed was a pilot.

705
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,972
I'll fly down on a Friday...

706
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,474
...refuel in the Bahamas
and then onto Medellin.

707
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,695
Please continue.

708
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:32,325
We make the pickup,
refuel once more in the Bahamas...

709
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,827
...then fly back on Sunday
with the mom-and-pop traffic.

710
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,162
Why are you speaking?

711
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,000
- What?
- You. Your responsibility is over.

712
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,544
You don't fly.
You're not a pilot, not a distributor.

713
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,797
You introduced us to Mr. Stevens
and the use of his plane. That's all.

714
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:50,092
You make a percentage and a generous one.
And you're lucky to get that.

715
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,094
I see.

716
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,431
Ahem. How much?

717
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,685
Padrino will pay 10,000 per kilo
for everyone. You, you and you.

718
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:03,564
Three million. That is all.
There is no negotiation.

719
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,149
I want two.

720
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,861
Jack, come on, a million each
had such a nice ring to it.

721
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:13,866
No way. I'm doing all the work,
I'm taking all the risk and it's my plane.

722
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,078
You guys don't have to do shit.
You just sit back and collect your money.

723
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,540
- You good with this?
- Ahem.

724
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,334
Yeah.

725
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,549
That's enough. That's enough.

726
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,556
No! No!

727
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,767
No!

728
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,107
No! No.

729
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,859
- Do you have pictures of your kids?
- What?

730
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,486
I'll need to see them.

731
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,405
I'll also need their names
and their schools.

732
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,074
We're entrusting you with
millions of dollars' worth of coca.

733
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,743
Without your children, there is no deal.

734
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,460
Fine.

735
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,924
Mr. Stevens?

736
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,094
Don't forget the pictures.

737
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,392
George.
- Huh?

738
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,729
George, come here. I need to talk to you.
George.

739
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,858
- George!
- Yeah, yeah. What? What?

740
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,444
- Come here. What's the matter, George?
Nothing.

741
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,404
I mean...

742
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,282
...beside from the fact
that we're moving 300 fucking kilos...

743
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,659
...and we're making dog shit,
nothing really.

744
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,287
Million dollars for our first run isn't bad,
George.

745
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,788
It's fucking chump change.

746
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,791
We may be hauling suitcases
across the border. We're screwed.

747
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:50,129
You know, George, this is a very small part
of business. Very small.

748
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,966
Which reminds me,
I need a favor from you.

749
00:50:55,510 --> 00:51:00,765
The favor was to pick up
50 kilos of cocaine. Fifty.

750
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,975
That's 110 pounds.

751
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,144
Not exactly a small favor.

752
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,480
It's not like bumming a cigarette,
for example.

753
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,484
But what the hell, I didn't have
anything better to do that day.

754
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,153
It's not like I was on parole or anything.

755
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:18,491
How you doing?
I'm George, friend of Diego's.

756
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,995
Where's Diego?

757
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,207
I don't know. He sent me. I'm George.

758
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,833
Oh.

759
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,460
George.

760
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,004
Well, that explains everything.

761
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,840
Open your mouth, George.

762
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,009
Get fucked.

763
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:40,596
Open your fucking mouth.

764
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,477
Now, you listen to me.

765
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,522
- You hearing me, huh?
- Yeah.

766
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,024
I've been holding 50 keys for Diego
for three weeks.

767
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,318
You tell him I don't appreciate it.

768
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,904
You tell him I want my money by Friday.

769
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,781
Can you do that?

770
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,284
- I think so.
- Heh, heh. "I think so."

771
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:20,553
- Hello.
Uh, may I speak to George, please?

772
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,638
George, you have a phone call.

773
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,473
Okay, Mom.

774
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,851
Thank you.

775
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,145
- Hello?
Hello. George?

776
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,021
- Diego.
Hey, how are you?

777
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,565
- How are you?
I'm fine.

778
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,733
- Where are you?
Uh, ha, ha.

779
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,112
Uh, bad news, George. I'm in Colombia.

780
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,780
Boy...

781
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,740
...I sure would like to see you.

782
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,742
And so would some of your old friends.

783
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:48,914
You know, George, it's a little bit hard
to get away right now.

784
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:53,419
I'm afraid you're on your own.
I'm in jail.

785
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,337
What?

786
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,256
Yeah.

787
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,799
Oh.

788
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,099
What I'm doing here
is measuring the purity.

789
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:12,605
Pure coke, uh, it melts away
at about 185, 190 degrees.

790
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:17,568
Cutting the agents,
they melt away at, uh, about 100...

791
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:22,948
...and quality product,
well, that's, uh, melting at around 140.

792
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,410
Hundred and thirty. Good.

793
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:31,290
A hundred and forty. Yes.

794
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,544
A hundred and fifty?

795
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:39,840
Fuck me running!
A hundred and sixty?

796
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:42,301
Jesus Christ, a hundred and seventy!

797
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,928
Hundred and eighty.

798
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,471
Hundred and...

799
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,933
A hundred and eighty-seven.

800
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,768
Where did you get this stuff?

801
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,811
Colombia.

802
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,649
Oh, uh...

803
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,984
Well, do you mind if I do a line?

804
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,653
Yeah, go ahead.

805
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,030
Fuck it. Let's all do one.

806
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,298
What did I tell you, Derek?

807
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,761
It's great, uh, but what am I
supposed to do with all this?

808
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,055
Sell it.

809
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,432
Jesus Christ.
I don't see you in two years...

810
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,186
...and you show up at my fucking door
with 110 pounds of blow?

811
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,522
Just fucking sell it, Derek.

812
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,359
All right, but it's gonna take me a year.

813
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:44,571
I can't feel my face.

814
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:48,993
I mean, I can touch it,
but I can't feel it inside.

815
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,833
Thirty-six hours.

816
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,503
Thirty-six hours.
I don't believe we got rid of it in 36 hours.

817
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,548
I think it's fair to say
you underestimated the market, Derek.

818
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:06,385
Right on. It's gonna take us longer
to count it than it did to sell it.

819
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,737
- Greetings, Mr. George.
- Hola, amigos.

820
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:28,407
Here you go, 1.35 million.

821
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,035
Any place in particular
you'd like to count?

822
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,328
On the plane.

823
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,747
What fucking plane?

824
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,938
Huh?

825
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,371
Thanks.

826
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,916
- Hey, what the fuck is going on here, huh?
Good to see you.

827
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,960
- I thought you were in jail.
- Pablo used his influence.

828
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,296
Now, George,
watch what you say, okay?

829
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,756
Everybody hears everything.

830
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,425
A lot of things get said and dÃ³nde...

831
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,803
- Well, let's say this isn't America, okay?
- All right.

832
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,806
Life is cheap here. No offense,
but you know what I'm saying.

833
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,475
All right, I'll just keep my fucking mouth
shut then.

834
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:41,605
Now, who's this person in California,
the connection?

835
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,149
- It's a friend.
- Who? I need to know.

836
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,819
It's a friend. A fucking friend, okay?
I'm not telling you.

837
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:47,986
- Who?
- A friend!

838
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:51,073
- I ain't telling you no more.
- Okay, we'll talk about it later.

839
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,786
Look, that's Pablo.

840
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,085
Oh.

841
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,971
Oh, shit.

842
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:24,857
El Padrino was SeÃ±or Pablo Escobar.

843
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:28,360
And for those of you living on the moon
for the last 20 years...

844
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,653
...he was it.

845
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,447
The boss of it all...

846
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,574
...el mÃ¡gico.

847
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,201
He will see you now.

848
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,495
- Okay, let's go.
- Not you.

849
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,841
Uh...

850
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,890
- What?
- No. You go.

851
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,683
- No. No, fuck, wait.
- Yeah, you go.

852
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,227
Ahh, it's gonna be fine.
You go. You go, George.

853
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,146
What the fuck? I'm not going over there.

854
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,814
- Yeah.
- No, you gotta do the talking.

855
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:11,278
He says SeÃ±or Escobar only wants
to see you. Not me. You go.

856
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,697
This way, please.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

857
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,741
Take it easy. It's gonna be fine.

858
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,078
All right, fuck it.

859
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,632
So you are the man, huh...

860
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:36,386
...who takes 50 kilos
and made them disappear in one day?

861
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,764
Actually, it was three days.

862
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,768
Greetings, Mr. George.

863
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,144
Welcome to Colombia.

864
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,525
Oh, this man.

865
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,818
He was full of courage.

866
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,070
Informant?

867
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:59,535
He would have run,
fled the country, gone to the policÃ­a...

868
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:04,706
...but then his wife, his children,
his parents, his friends...

869
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,084
...many people would die.

870
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,342
Well, let me take this opportunity...

871
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,011
...to thank you for inviting me
to your beautiful country.

872
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:21,265
- Beautiful, yes. But poor.
- Yeah.

873
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:25,519
Coffee, bananas, these are our main export
along with mota.

874
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:30,607
We've been overrun by the fucking
comunistas, but that is another story.

875
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,946
Our business here today is cocaine, yes?

876
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,365
Yes, it is.

877
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:43,412
I need to find an americano
who I can trust.

878
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,791
One with, uh, honor, intelligence...

879
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,003
You need an americano with balls,
SeÃ±or Escobar.

880
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,504
Yes.

881
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,007
And balls, Mr. George.

882
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,800
Well, lookit.

883
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,344
I can do several things for you.

884
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,389
I can transport the cocaine
from your ranch here in Colombia...

885
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,017
...to the United States
starting with California.

886
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,060
I got pilots, I got planes standing by.

887
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,979
Good, good.

888
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,897
But I need more details.

889
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,441
What is the cost?

890
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,942
Uh...

891
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,988
Right off the top of my head...
Well, I'd have to talk to Diego...

892
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:21,033
...but let's just say,
roughly 10,000 per kilo.

893
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,701
Mm-hm.

894
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,995
How much can you transport?

895
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:29,207
Again, this is the language that I would
have to discuss with my partner...

896
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,544
...but, uh, 300 kilos...

897
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,088
So that's $3 million.

898
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,924
This I understand.

899
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,761
But, please, tÃº remove.

900
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:45,140
- Yeah.
- This complications with Diego.

901
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,018
The stolen cars,
getting him released from the cÃ¡rcel.

902
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,646
This causes me much inconvenience.

903
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,774
The 50 kilos could have been
a big problem, huh?

904
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,692
I don't like problems.

905
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,574
Uh...

906
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:06,244
With all due respect, El Padrino...

907
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,580
...Diego is my partner.

908
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,249
So I won't negotiate without him.

909
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,919
I won't do business without him.
I just won't.

910
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,338
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

911
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,935
Let us speak no more of this.
Let's go on a drive.

912
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,396
We have many other things
to talk about, yes?

913
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,511
I've made a decision.

914
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,639
We're going into business together
and I want to start right away.

915
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,266
Whoo!

916
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:14,312
Cocaine exploded upon
the American culture like an atomic bomb.

917
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,065
It started in Hollywood and moved east
in no time.

918
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,569
Everyone was doing it. I mean, everyone.

919
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,420
We invented the marketplace.

920
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:43,508
In fact, if you snorted cocaine
in the late 1970s or early '80s...

921
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:46,344
...there was an 85 percent chance
it came from us.

922
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,513
All right, 3 million. I counted it twice.

923
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:51,183
Two-point-five, 2.5, I'm sure.

924
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,351
I'm calling it 3.

925
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,979
Then we're half a million off, huh?

926
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,648
Well, fuck it. I'm not counting it again.

927
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,358
Weigh it.

928
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:03,487
If it's 60 pounds, it's 3 million.
Fifty is 2.5.

929
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:06,031
Well, I don't give a shit.
It's close enough.

930
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,908
Where do I put it?

931
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:11,119
Try the back bedroom.

932
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:14,790
No room.

933
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,127
Try the closet.

934
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,379
Uh...

935
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,965
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

936
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:29,721
The Colombians recommended
Noriega's bank in Panama City.

937
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:33,683
It was either that or launder it in the States
for a 60 percent surcharge.

938
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:38,313
What? Keep only 40 percent of my money?
No, thanks.

939
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,940
Congratulations, gentlemen.

940
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,234
Even Pablo kept his money there.

941
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,069
- I love it.
Who'd fuck with us?

942
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,695
I'm sorry.

943
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:48,406
I give you $30 million...

944
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,450
...and you give me this little book.

945
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,447
- I'm married.
- Yeah, I know it.

946
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:32,284
- Can you believe I'm married?
- You're a very lucky man.

947
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:33,785
- I love you.
- I'm proud of you.

948
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:37,163
- I love you.
- I love you too, my brother. I love you too.

949
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,979
Hello.

950
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,064
Do I know you?

951
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,152
I don't think so.

952
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,945
No?

953
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:13,491
Why are you smiling?

954
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,493
I don't know.

955
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,873
I'm George.

956
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:23,585
I know who you are, an americano.

957
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:27,255
Mr. Jung.
I see you've met my fiancÃ©e, Mirtha.

958
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,008
Yeah?

959
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:33,511
Yeah. Augusto would like
to see you immediately.

960
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,765
- Augusto would like to see you.
- Okay.

961
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:39,017
Okay.

962
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,186
In a minute.

963
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,606
Okay. Excuse us a minute.

964
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:46,858
Go ahead.

965
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:56,326
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

966
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,002
George.

967
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:10,674
- Please, join us. Have a drink.
How you doing? All right, fellas?

968
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:12,801
You remember Mr. George?
- Mr. George.

969
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,011
Congratulations on your conquest
of the West Coast.

970
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:16,721
Thank you. Thanks very much.

971
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,682
How much bigger can we get?

972
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:23,311
Sky's the limit. It's accepted by actors
and musicians, everybody else will follow.

973
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,730
- Actors and musicians.
- Actors and musicians.

974
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,816
- Actors and musicians.
- And musicians.

975
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,235
- Very good. Very good.
Diego.

976
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,154
We were just discussing George's
West Coast operations.

977
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,408
- Hey.
- Yeah, George's mystery man.

978
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:39,452
Yes, what is this mystery man?
When do we meet him?

979
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,872
Well, you can't meet him.
George keeps him a secret.

980
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,916
He's here meeting everybody...

981
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,002
...he goes to Colombia, meets Pablo...

982
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:50,255
...but still he keeps his secret,
even from his brother, huh?

983
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,424
Come on. We're all in this together.

984
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:54,843
- Yes, George, there's plenty for everybody.
- No.

985
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,344
You know, I think that...

986
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:59,556
I think that El Padrino's happy
with the current situation, you know?

987
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,850
Don't you? Yeah.

988
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,773
I'll be back. Excuse me.

989
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:11,276
You go.

990
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:54,611
Breaking up a Colombian marriage
was a serious thing.

991
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,988
A lot of people were pissed off.

992
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,323
Didn't matter.

993
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,658
I was Escobar's guy.

994
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,952
I was untouchable.

995
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,313
Mirtha became my running partner.

996
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,524
Beautiful, passionate...

997
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,442
...and as crazy as I was.

998
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:37,779
She could party like a man
and love like a woman.

999
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,449
There was only one problem.

1000
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:44,160
I would always be a gringo
to the cartel.

1001
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,705
Mirtha could change all that
with two choice words:

1002
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,707
I do.

1003
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,709
So do I.

1004
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,713
We had the world
by the short and curlies.

1005
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:59,217
We were young, rich and in love.

1006
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,386
Nothing could stop us.

1007
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,681
It was perfect.

1008
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,312
Oh, dear God.

1009
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,983
Hey.

1010
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,028
Put that shit away.
You're pregnant, for chrissakes.

1011
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:22,240
Ah, don't be such a fucking hypocrite.

1012
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,533
I quit smoking, didn't I?

1013
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,412
Just put it away.
My fucking parents are here. Come on.

1014
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:31,583
Oh, my...

1015
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:36,462
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Oh, God, it's enormous.

1016
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,298
You like it?

1017
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:39,757
Just look...

1018
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,136
Look at this credenza.

1019
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:48,266
Oh, yes. What, it's Spanish?

1020
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,185
If you don't mind,
how much is one of these?

1021
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,770
- It's gotta cost a fortune.
It's a family heirloom.

1022
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:54,272
I've seen these in magazines.

1023
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,400
- They don't come cheap.
- Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.

1024
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,319
- Oh.
Pappy, do you like it?

1025
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:00,695
- Very nice.
- Nice.

1026
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,614
Come, I'll show you the rest of the house.

1027
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,700
Oh, great.
George mentioned a Jacuzzi.

1028
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,995
I've always wanted a Jacuzzi.
Oh, and one of those bidets.

1029
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,747
Cocktail?

1030
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,916
Yeah. Business has been pretty good.

1031
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:16,294
I got this little import-export thing
going down in Miami.

1032
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,504
And that's been very profitable for me.

1033
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:20,215
I got my investments. I got, uh...

1034
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,759
Don't bullshit me, George.

1035
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:26,429
I don't wanna waste the time.
I don't see you that much.

1036
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:31,476
You come from my body, remember?
You're my baby boy.

1037
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:36,147
Same kid who would jump off a mountain
if someone told him he couldn't do it.

1038
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:40,235
You haven't changed that much, heh,
have you?

1039
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:42,487
Wow.

1040
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:50,954
I know what you're up to.

1041
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:54,791
Not everything, but I get the picture.

1042
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:57,877
And I don't care.

1043
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,796
I don't like it.

1044
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,840
It's not what I would've chosen for you.

1045
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:06,177
But it's your life.

1046
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:09,180
It's got nothing to do with me.

1047
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:14,560
I couldn't stop you if I wanted to,
could I?

1048
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:17,021
- Probably not.
- No.

1049
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,317
It's good.

1050
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,945
Got a family.

1051
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,447
It's good if it makes you happy.

1052
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,618
It's nice to have nice things, George.

1053
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:32,704
Phew.

1054
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,206
Are you happy?

1055
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,835
Yeah.

1056
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:41,421
Yeah, at the moment, I am happy, Dad.

1057
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,513
Three years?

1058
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,891
How long have we been in business?
Three years?

1059
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:56,477
Does she get to meet your connection?
Was she good enough?

1060
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:58,855
Shut up, Diego.

1061
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:01,524
Gonna be here any minute.
I'm trying to concentrate.

1062
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:04,277
Okay? I'm very angry with you, George.
Very angry.

1063
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:07,989
You don't take me to California,
but you take your bitch wife? A woman?

1064
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,575
It was you and me who started this.
Hey, you and me.

1065
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:13,995
What do you need my connection for?
What are you gonna do with it?

1066
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:16,122
Nothing.

1067
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,249
It's for the principle.
It's for peace of mind.

1068
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,918
Jesus fucking Christ.
I ain't telling you, it's just business.

1069
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:25,089
- Now shut up. You're driving me crazy.
- I'm driving you fucking crazy?

1070
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:27,425
You're driving me fucking crazy.

1071
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:30,595
We had a dream.
What happened to our dream?

1072
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:31,763
- Go inside.
- Shit.

1073
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,264
Go on.

1074
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,439
I give you everything.
I give you everybody.

1075
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,566
And what do you give me, George, hmm?

1076
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,318
What do you give me?

1077
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,738
No, no, amigo.

1078
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:53,159
Right?

1079
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:58,664
No problem.
We'll count the shit later.

1080
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:04,045
You embarrassed me, George.
You made me look very bad.

1081
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:07,131
Nothing.

1082
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:10,468
No, everything is not right.
I bring you in and you slap my fucking face.

1083
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,512
This is not the fucking time, Diego.

1084
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:15,473
No, no, no.

1085
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,810
No, listen.

1086
01:13:18,977 --> 01:13:20,978
Okay, you take the keys.
You take them and go.

1087
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:26,776
Whoa!

1088
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:38,913
Oh, fuck.

1089
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:43,418
Okay?

1090
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:45,962
Everything's all right.
There's no problem.

1091
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,965
Okay? Never happened.

1092
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,467
Nobody has to know anything about this.

1093
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:55,513
Diego, I want you to very calmly tell
these nice gentlemen...

1094
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:58,683
...where the fucking cocaine is, all right?
Do it now.

1095
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:04,188
Okay?

1096
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:08,192
Nice doing business with you gentlemen.
Goodbye.

1097
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:17,243
Derek Foreal.

1098
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,037
What?

1099
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:23,541
Derek Foreal.
Derek fucking Foreal, all right?

1100
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,877
Answer to all your fucking dreams.

1101
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,546
Happy now?

1102
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:39,807
Derek?

1103
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,561
Derek Foreal, Diego Delgado.

1104
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,207
Good to see you. Thank you.

1105
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,925
- Hey.
- Hello.

1106
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:17,845
I'm so happy to see you, to look at you.
You're beautiful. You're about to burst.

1107
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,180
I am.

1108
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:25,728
Tell her not to drink too much, please.

1109
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:28,439
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Me too.

1110
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,274
- We've a lot to talk about.
- Where's Diego?

1111
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:31,859
He's not here.

1112
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,904
Where is he?
And who the fuck is this Norman Cay guy?

1113
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:38,199
Everybody's talking about Norman Cay.
Norman Cay this, Norman Cay that.

1114
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,784
You know him?

1115
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,286
He's not a person.

1116
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:44,914
Norman's Cay is an island.

1117
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,123
In the Bahamas.

1118
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:50,336
From what they say, it's very peaceful
and that's where Diego has his new home.

1119
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:53,381
As I understand it,
he's bought 160 acres.

1120
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,467
A hotel, a marina and an airstrip.

1121
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:59,845
He's doing multiple runs right now
using the island as a jump-off point.

1122
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:01,931
- What?
- Yes.

1123
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,809
And Jack Stevens
is already a very busy man.

1124
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,228
Along with many others.

1125
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,857
No shit.

1126
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:25,413
Hello?

1127
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:26,998
Hello, Derek.

1128
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:28,416
George.

1129
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,501
Hey, am I wearing lipstick?

1130
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:32,503
I said, am I wearing lipstick?

1131
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,755
When I'm getting fucked,
I wanna make sure my face...

1132
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:37,008
Hey, look, I don't wanna be
in the middle of this.

1133
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,176
That's between you and Diego.

1134
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:42,138
- I bring you into this... Hang on.
- Happy New Year.

1135
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:45,057
Happy New Year, honey.
I bring you in, this is how you pay back?

1136
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:49,353
Hey, look, George,
it's nothing personal. I love you.

1137
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:50,855
This is business.

1138
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:53,566
I gotta go, George.
- Derek.

1139
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,359
Derek.

1140
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:59,488
What's wrong?

1141
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:04,035
- What?
- Nothing.

1142
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:05,870
Happy New Year.

1143
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,850
Welcome, my friend.

1144
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:30,519
- It's been a long time.
- Don't touch me.

1145
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,194
Hey.

1146
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:41,405
Happy to see you, George. My brother.

1147
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:43,366
No more brothers, Diego.

1148
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,621
Why do you say that? Huh?

1149
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:51,248
You heard me, George.
Of course we are brothers.

1150
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:54,085
You fucked me.

1151
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,629
I did not.

1152
01:17:57,714 --> 01:17:59,507
Yeah, you did.

1153
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,842
You went behind my back.
You cut me out. You fucked me.

1154
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,594
Me? No.

1155
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,931
Never, George.

1156
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:08,766
Never.

1157
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,184
Mm-mm.

1158
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,689
I talked to Derek.

1159
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,991
Well...

1160
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:29,036
...maybe you're right.

1161
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:32,581
Maybe I did betray you...

1162
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,709
...a little bit.

1163
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:42,717
Yeah.

1164
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,554
Yeah, I stole your California connection.

1165
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,515
So what? Hmm?

1166
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:53,352
Who introduced you
to Pablo Escobar, huh?

1167
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,980
Me. Me.

1168
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:59,650
Who introduced you
to your fucking Colombian wife, hmm?

1169
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:02,403
Me. Who protect you...

1170
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:07,199
...when my friend, Cesar Rosa,
wanted to slice your fucking throat out?

1171
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:09,493
Huh? Me.

1172
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:13,831
Who made you make millions
and millions of dollars?

1173
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:14,999
Me.

1174
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,461
And what do I get in return?

1175
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:20,629
This.

1176
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:23,758
Accusations.

1177
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:28,846
I have always given you
everything, George.

1178
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,514
Always.

1179
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,349
But...

1180
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,939
...that is over now.

1181
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,151
Yeah.

1182
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:44,528
You know, this is my operation,
my dream.

1183
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:45,780
So go home.

1184
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:49,325
Go back home.

1185
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:52,036
Go home. Go back
to your stupid little life.

1186
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:54,663
Go back and sell half grams
to your fucking relatives...

1187
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:56,874
...for all I care because you're out...

1188
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:00,211
Because you're out.

1189
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:02,129
And don't be so emotional, George.

1190
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:03,589
We're brothers.

1191
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,549
We are brothers.

1192
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,891
Next time it's fucking loaded.

1193
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:23,818
Bye. Bye. Bye.

1194
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,195
Bye.

1195
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:34,537
Say hello to your pretty wife for me.

1196
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:35,913
Sure.

1197
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:40,269
Hello.

1198
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:46,400
Jesus Christ.

1199
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,360
It's all right, honey.

1200
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:50,946
Look at you.

1201
01:21:51,114 --> 01:21:52,323
It's okay.

1202
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:54,491
It's okay, baby.

1203
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,368
It's over.

1204
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,163
I quit the business. I'm out.

1205
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:02,708
It's all over.

1206
01:22:03,835 --> 01:22:05,920
And I'm not going back.

1207
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:10,049
It's just you and me...

1208
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:12,009
...and the baby.

1209
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,596
And there's nothing else. There's just us.

1210
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:18,974
You know...

1211
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:22,144
...fuck it.

1212
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:32,404
Fuck them.

1213
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:38,953
Come here.

1214
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:40,829
I did.

1215
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,706
I quit the business.

1216
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:44,750
Got out completely.

1217
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:47,044
I mean, what the fuck? Why not?

1218
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:51,799
I'd made $60 million
and I was out clean.

1219
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:56,387
Well, maybe I jumped the gun on "clean."

1220
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:59,390
Georgie, let's go. The baby's coming.
Right, right, right.

1221
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:02,851
I'm coming, I'm fucking coming.
Jesus Christ.

1222
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:05,396
George, hurry up.

1223
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,694
Georgie, let's go.

1224
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:14,738
Right. Right. Right. What the fuck?

1225
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:16,532
George! George!

1226
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,866
George!
George!

1227
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,577
George.

1228
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,001
I'll be right down.

1229
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:39,638
Watching my baby girl being born
did something to me.

1230
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:40,848
Motherfucker!

1231
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,183
They talk about religious experiences.

1232
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,102
I didn't believe in religion.

1233
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,563
Hell, I didn't even particularly like kids.

1234
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:52,568
But when Kristina Sunshine Jung came
into this world, something in me changed.

1235
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:55,446
I knew what I was put on the planet for.

1236
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:57,948
It was the greatest feeling I ever had.

1237
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:03,162
Followed very abruptly
by the worst feeling I ever had.

1238
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:04,663
George!

1239
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,459
Call the cardiologist.
I think he's having a heart attack.

1240
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:10,169
George!

1241
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:18,552
The official toxicity limit for humans...

1242
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,598
...is between 1 and 1 and a half grams
of cocaine, depending on body weight.

1243
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:26,351
I was averaging 5 grams a day.
Maybe more.

1244
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:29,313
I snorted 10 grams in 10 minutes once.

1245
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,273
I guess I had a high tolerance.

1246
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:34,568
George, look, I'm not here
to give you lectures.

1247
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:37,946
I have no moral interest in what you do
or don't do.

1248
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:40,532
But take it easy, George.

1249
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,785
Stay with us a while.

1250
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:45,204
You have a daughter now.

1251
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,002
A daughter.

1252
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:15,567
I came home and cleaned up my act.

1253
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,027
I didn't do anything.

1254
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:19,113
No drink, no nothing.

1255
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,948
Sober as a judge.

1256
01:25:21,741 --> 01:25:24,201
My life was all about Kristina.

1257
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:27,121
Being with her, taking care of her.

1258
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:29,498
I wanted to be a father.

1259
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:33,001
A good father,
just like my old man was to me.

1260
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,667
After five years of laying low...

1261
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,169
...still sober...

1262
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,838
...Mirtha needed to have some fun.
- Guys, excuse me.

1263
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,673
So on my 38th birthday...

1264
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:23,468
...she threw a little party
and invited some old friends.

1265
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:27,389
Happy birthday, George.

1266
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,392
Mirtha invited me.

1267
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,436
Yeah, she told me.

1268
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:36,773
Look, I'm sorry about everything.

1269
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:40,277
You were right. I did fuck you.

1270
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,654
And Diego fucked me.

1271
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:44,323
Cut me out too.

1272
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:46,283
Well, yeah, I heard about it.

1273
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,369
I lost sight of everything, George.

1274
01:26:50,121 --> 01:26:51,914
Forgot who my friends were.

1275
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,251
Well, fuck it.

1276
01:26:56,419 --> 01:26:58,128
It's in the past.

1277
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,297
Just forget about it.
I'm out of the business...

1278
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:02,758
...so we'll just move on, eh?

1279
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:04,468
Yeah.

1280
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:06,803
Good to see you, Derek.

1281
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:08,513
You too.

1282
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:12,392
Let's get a drink.

1283
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:14,311
Who's cutting your hair?

1284
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,981
Let's fucking party, motherfucker.

1285
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:20,651
Let's have some fucking fun!

1286
01:27:21,152 --> 01:27:23,320
- Jesus, is that Mirtha?
- Yeah.

1287
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:27,157
Christ almighty, George.
What does she weigh, 80 pounds?

1288
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,869
Yeah, give or take. Come on.

1289
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:40,420
Okay.

1290
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,523
Freeze!

1291
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:01,275
Waiters.

1292
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:03,235
So it's George, is it?

1293
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:07,239
I'm the only guy on the planet
gets busted by fucking waiters.

1294
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:11,994
Why the feds decided to bust me
on that particular night, I'll never know.

1295
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:15,664
Maybe it was the Porsches
and the Maseratis in the driveway...

1296
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:18,709
...my Colombian guest list
or the cocaine buffet.

1297
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:23,130
Whatever it was, they were just waiting
for me to slip up.

1298
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,174
And I did.

1299
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:09,718
What's this?

1300
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:12,387
This is your statement.
How it was all yours.

1301
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:14,431
The pound of cocaine
was for personal use.

1302
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:16,767
None of the other guests
had any idea it was there.

1303
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:18,477
Yeah, right.

1304
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:27,611
I want my kid out of protective custody.
Now. No fucking around.

1305
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:31,448
My wife and my daughter
on a plane tonight.

1306
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:34,910
I sign this shit when I know
they're safe and sound.

1307
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:36,787
- No fucking way.
- Well, fuck you.

1308
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:38,914
I sign nothing, then.

1309
01:29:44,587 --> 01:29:45,962
Do it.

1310
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:51,176
- Oh, you know what, one more thing.
Yeah, what?

1311
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:52,886
Get me a six-pack.

1312
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,263
Yeah, right.

1313
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:03,980
There was no way in the world
I was going back to prison.

1314
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:09,152
So I signed the deal, took the rap
and posted bail.

1315
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,490
Once again, I would become
a fugitive on the run.

1316
01:30:18,621 --> 01:30:20,080
Hi, Dad.

1317
01:30:20,456 --> 01:30:22,249
Hello, George.

1318
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:28,505
Ermine, your son is here.

1319
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,465
Tell him I don't wanna see him.

1320
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:34,136
- Tell him he's not welcome here.
- Mom...

1321
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:36,805
Don't you dare step foot in this house.

1322
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:39,433
You're not my son, you hear me?

1323
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:42,644
I don't have a son anymore.

1324
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:49,609
She's angry, George.

1325
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:52,154
It's been all over the news.

1326
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:56,450
Yeah.

1327
01:30:57,326 --> 01:30:59,786
I just wanted let you guys know...

1328
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:03,039
...that, uh, I'm gonna be going away
for a little while.

1329
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:07,961
You're not gonna go to trial?

1330
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:09,921
No.

1331
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,596
Okay.

1332
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:30,609
So this is it.

1333
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,821
I hope not, Pop.

1334
01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:38,909
Me too.

1335
01:31:50,379 --> 01:31:51,755
Okay.

1336
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:56,676
- I gotta go, Pop. I'll see you.
- Yeah.

1337
01:31:56,844 --> 01:31:59,221
- You take care of yourself, George.
- You too.

1338
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:21,117
SeÃ±or Jung?
- Yeah.

1339
01:32:21,285 --> 01:32:23,161
I wish to present SeÃ±or Rodriguez.

1340
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:25,539
He's the president of our bank.

1341
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:26,748
Hi.

1342
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:33,296
I am afraid that there is a problem,
Mr. Jung.

1343
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:35,507
The banks have gone through a change.

1344
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:37,884
Nationalization.

1345
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:43,473
I am afraid that, uh,
your funds have been appropriated...

1346
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:46,142
...by the Panamanian government.

1347
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:49,479
Please forgive me.

1348
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:53,108
Someone should have called you
from the bank earlier.

1349
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:56,194
My apologies, please.

1350
01:32:59,865 --> 01:33:01,825
What are we going to do?

1351
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:05,912
- What are we going to use for money?
Mirtha, please.

1352
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,623
I will talk to Augusto tonight.
I'll start working for him.

1353
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:11,501
Just tell me!
Just answer the fucking question!

1354
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:14,170
What do we spend? What?

1355
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:16,047
How will we live?

1356
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:18,133
Not in front of the kid.

1357
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:20,260
Don't give me that shit.

1358
01:33:20,886 --> 01:33:22,178
Just better do something.

1359
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:40,530
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
Don't be upset.

1360
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:43,992
What's happening to us?

1361
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:48,204
I don't know.

1362
01:33:49,248 --> 01:33:51,374
Are we gonna get split up?

1363
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:54,419
No, Jesus. God, don't even say that.

1364
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,548
Listen to me. I love your mother.

1365
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:01,551
But she's upset right now.

1366
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:06,723
And you're my heart, kid.

1367
01:34:08,517 --> 01:34:10,602
Now, could I live without my heart?

1368
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:13,396
I hope not.

1369
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:19,903
Take it easy. There's a cop back there,
all right? Right behind us.

1370
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,072
Just fucking drive.

1371
01:34:22,406 --> 01:34:24,074
What is your fucking problem?

1372
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:29,871
We are broke. That's my fucking problem.

1373
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:32,582
- And you are a fucking spy.
- What?

1374
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:36,252
That's right.

1375
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:39,255
- Always spying, always judging.
- Right.

1376
01:34:39,423 --> 01:34:42,342
Everyone's laughing at you in your face,
you fucking pussy.

1377
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,718
Thanks.

1378
01:34:43,886 --> 01:34:45,595
You let Diego fuck you in the ass.

1379
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,181
- Right.
- Maybe because you like it.

1380
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:50,684
- Maybe because you are a fucking faggot.
- Right.

1381
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:52,644
That's what I think you are.

1382
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:55,271
I think you're fucking him
because you're not fucking me.

1383
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:57,774
You gotta be fucking somebody else.

1384
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:00,527
- Why's that?
- Come on. Take it easy.

1385
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:03,613
- Why don't you fuck me anymore?
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

1386
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:07,575
- Why? Why don't you fuck me anymore?
- Get over there. Mirtha.

1387
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:20,630
Don't you ever put your hands on me,
motherfucker!

1388
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,632
Don't you ever touch me again!

1389
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,467
- Asshole!
- Relax!

1390
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:27,095
Get your hands off me!

1391
01:35:27,638 --> 01:35:30,640
He's a fugitive
and a fucking cocaine dealer!

1392
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:33,977
He has a kilo in his trunk right now!

1393
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,437
Look. Let me see that...

1394
01:35:35,604 --> 01:35:38,982
Take this sorry motherfucker to jail.

1395
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:21,649
I'm divorcing you, George.

1396
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,153
And I'm getting custody of Kristina.

1397
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:30,492
And when you get out next week,
you're gonna pay support.

1398
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:32,368
And that's the end of it.

1399
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,078
Okay?

1400
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:38,166
There is someone else.

1401
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,961
I don't think you care...

1402
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,298
...but I wanted to tell you.

1403
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:50,303
Say something.

1404
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:53,723
What do you want me to say?

1405
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:56,726
I'm in prison.

1406
01:36:58,395 --> 01:37:02,357
- You should know, you put me in here.
- I knew you'd say something like that.

1407
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:07,612
Always thinking about yourself.

1408
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:20,792
Say hello to your father.
- My God.

1409
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,502
Say hello to your father.
- No.

1410
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,087
Go now. Say hello.

1411
01:37:31,762 --> 01:37:33,471
Hello, sweetheart.

1412
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:37,892
I thought you couldn't live
without your heart.

1413
01:38:10,175 --> 01:38:12,802
Every single day in the joint...

1414
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:14,888
...I thought of one thing...

1415
01:38:15,055 --> 01:38:17,140
...one thing only:

1416
01:38:17,766 --> 01:38:19,726
My baby girl.

1417
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,563
I needed to get my heart back.

1418
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,503
Hi, honey.

1419
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:49,547
What are you doing here?

1420
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:55,345
Well, I just wanted to let you know
that I was out and I wanted to see you.

1421
01:38:57,222 --> 01:38:58,431
How you doing?

1422
01:38:58,974 --> 01:39:02,060
George, you just can't show
up like this.

1423
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:04,938
Why don't you try calling me Dad?

1424
01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:06,773
I don't want to, all right?

1425
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:11,235
- Now leave me alone.
- Wait, honey. Listen, Kristina.

1426
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,155
I'm sorry.

1427
01:39:15,157 --> 01:39:17,575
I wanna make everything okay.

1428
01:39:17,743 --> 01:39:19,202
You know?

1429
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:22,914
What do you want from me, huh?

1430
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:27,710
I wanna be your dad again.

1431
01:39:28,837 --> 01:39:31,506
I just wanna walk with you,
if you don't mind.

1432
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:36,302
I wanna make everything okay.

1433
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:38,763
Please, Kristina.

1434
01:39:39,181 --> 01:39:43,184
If you could go anywhere in the world,
anywhere...

1435
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:47,105
...where would you wanna go?
I was making headway.

1436
01:39:47,272 --> 01:39:51,067
Kristina and I walked
to and from school every day.

1437
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,903
- Things were starting to look up.
- Maybe California?

1438
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:57,490
California?
Well, you can go anywhere in the world.

1439
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:02,412
You can go to India, Tibet.
Uh, Israel, France, whatever.

1440
01:40:02,621 --> 01:40:04,831
- You'd still choose California?
- Yeah.

1441
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:06,416
Yeah?

1442
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:08,626
Hey, Mom.

1443
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:12,588
All right. Well, look, go on inside.

1444
01:40:12,756 --> 01:40:14,215
Okay.

1445
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:20,346
- Bye, Dad. See you in the morning.
- Okay, I'll be here.

1446
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,350
- Hey, Mom.
Hi.

1447
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:26,728
I'm gonna go inside
and do my homework.

1448
01:40:26,895 --> 01:40:29,188
Okay, honey. I'll be there in a minute.

1449
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:37,905
What do you want?

1450
01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:40,783
Truce.

1451
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:44,037
I don't wanna fight with you anymore,
Mirtha.

1452
01:40:44,204 --> 01:40:46,831
I just wanna get along with you,
you know?

1453
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:49,459
Be civil.

1454
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:54,964
You know I've been seeing Kristina,
right?

1455
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:56,966
Yeah, she told me.

1456
01:40:57,509 --> 01:40:59,510
You walk her to school.

1457
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:01,262
Yeah.

1458
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:07,060
Anyway, I've been thinking, uh...

1459
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:11,439
I love her. You know that.

1460
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:16,652
I was thinking I'd kind of like to have her.

1461
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,199
I've been away for such a long time,
you know, I just...

1462
01:41:22,993 --> 01:41:24,911
I just wanna be with her.

1463
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:29,707
I haven't seen one dollar from you.

1464
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,667
You haven't paid me one cent.

1465
01:41:34,296 --> 01:41:37,256
Child support, alimony.

1466
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:42,011
You start helping us...

1467
01:41:42,387 --> 01:41:44,555
...we'll see what will happen.

1468
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:51,020
All right. That's it.

1469
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:53,272
That's all I wanted to say.

1470
01:41:55,734 --> 01:41:56,859
Take care, yeah?

1471
01:41:57,027 --> 01:41:58,653
You too.

1472
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:05,785
George.

1473
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:13,459
Are you okay?

1474
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:17,964
Yeah.

1475
01:42:20,342 --> 01:42:22,218
Hello? Derek.

1476
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:23,719
Hey, George.

1477
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:26,681
Lookit.

1478
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:29,684
I need to do something.
I wanna put together a crew, huh?

1479
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:31,477
Know anybody?

1480
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:34,856
It's a four-man operation.

1481
01:42:35,023 --> 01:42:37,233
Two on the ground, two in the air.

1482
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:39,110
Who's the copilot?

1483
01:42:40,195 --> 01:42:42,029
You're looking at him.

1484
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:44,991
We'll provide the plane,
transportation costs...

1485
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:47,827
...U.S. Landing spot, and we'll take it
wherever you want it to go.

1486
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,871
You provide a pickup point
in South America...

1487
01:42:50,038 --> 01:42:51,914
...and you're responsible for payment.

1488
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:54,709
You also assume all bust risk.

1489
01:42:55,502 --> 01:42:58,296
After that, we take 65 percent
of all transportation fees...

1490
01:42:58,463 --> 01:43:01,382
...10 percent of the gross,
plus our expenses.

1491
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:05,511
And this is not a negotiation,
so if it's okay with you, we can talk further.

1492
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:08,014
If not, forget we had this conversation.

1493
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,224
No, no, no. Everything sounds good.

1494
01:43:10,392 --> 01:43:13,769
Um, I'm gonna need to meet
everybody involved, though.

1495
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:17,732
Right there at the table.

1496
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:19,942
Come on.

1497
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:22,695
Gentlemen, this is George.

1498
01:43:23,322 --> 01:43:24,530
- George.
What do you say?

1499
01:43:24,698 --> 01:43:25,948
- Georgie.
My God, Dulli.

1500
01:43:26,116 --> 01:43:27,116
- Oh, my God.
Dulli.

1501
01:43:27,284 --> 01:43:30,453
- Jesus. It's been 14 years, man.
- Oh, man, George.

1502
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:32,246
- You look great.
- Yeah, so do you.

1503
01:43:32,414 --> 01:43:34,665
Hey, this is my friend.
I've known this guy for 30 years.

1504
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:37,043
- Ben.
- How do you do?

1505
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:39,420
- Have my seat.
- Nice to see you.

1506
01:43:39,963 --> 01:43:41,797
Heard you got married.

1507
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:44,884
Hey, honey, you know what?

1508
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:46,469
What?

1509
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:50,056
I was thinking about getting
out of town this week.

1510
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:52,016
And where are you going?

1511
01:43:52,184 --> 01:43:53,476
I don't know.

1512
01:43:53,644 --> 01:43:56,229
- Maybe California.
- Liar.

1513
01:43:56,396 --> 01:43:57,563
Yeah.

1514
01:43:57,731 --> 01:44:00,441
Go out there, check it out,
see what it's like.

1515
01:44:00,609 --> 01:44:02,777
I got a few things
I have to take care of first...

1516
01:44:02,945 --> 01:44:05,988
...but I was thinking maybe Thursday.
You know, Thursday after school.

1517
01:44:06,156 --> 01:44:09,033
You know I can't.
Mom will never let me go.

1518
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:10,743
You let me take care of your mother.

1519
01:44:11,161 --> 01:44:12,954
You just pack your bags, okay?

1520
01:44:13,121 --> 01:44:14,622
But I've got school.

1521
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:18,751
I know. But a friend of mine told me
that they got schools in California too.

1522
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:21,337
- You swear?
- Yeah.

1523
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:24,840
Three o'clock, Thursday,
at your mother's. You and me, huh?

1524
01:44:25,008 --> 01:44:27,677
- It's a date.
- I don't believe you.

1525
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:33,474
I swear on my life, Scout's honor.

1526
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:36,185
Swear on my life.

1527
01:44:41,191 --> 01:44:42,984
I swear on your life.

1528
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:09,385
All right.

1529
01:45:11,513 --> 01:45:13,889
That's a nice boy.

1530
01:45:14,224 --> 01:45:16,142
Go on, get him, Dulli.

1531
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,228
Get in.

1532
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:29,113
- Oh, yeah.
- Are we good?

1533
01:45:29,448 --> 01:45:33,743
Are we good? Yeah, we're good.
We're fucking beautiful.

1534
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,161
We're perfect.

1535
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:39,790
This is Grade A, 100-percent pure
Colombian cocaine, ladies and gentlemen.

1536
01:45:39,958 --> 01:45:41,500
Disco shit.

1537
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:43,586
- Pure as the driven snow.
- Oh, yeah.

1538
01:45:43,754 --> 01:45:46,547
- Right.
- Good fucking riddance.

1539
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:48,215
- Dulli.
- Yeah.

1540
01:45:48,383 --> 01:45:50,092
- You saved my fucking life.
- No, I didn't.

1541
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:52,303
No shit. You'll never know. Really.

1542
01:45:52,471 --> 01:45:53,512
All you guys.

1543
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,222
Really.

1544
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:58,601
And being as how I'm feeling
so fucking generous tonight...

1545
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:01,354
...you just got a raise.

1546
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:04,398
A raise?
- Yeah.

1547
01:46:04,566 --> 01:46:07,568
Instead of 10 percent,
you're gonna get 15.

1548
01:46:08,278 --> 01:46:09,612
Jesus, George.

1549
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:12,239
Fifteen percent?
That's an extra 200 grand.

1550
01:46:12,657 --> 01:46:14,450
That's right. Fuck it.

1551
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:17,453
Do whatever want with it.
Have a nice life. I'm out.

1552
01:46:18,955 --> 01:46:20,414
Last fucking party.

1553
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:22,958
I'm gonna go out to California.

1554
01:46:23,126 --> 01:46:25,461
Start a new life with my kid.

1555
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:27,296
Here's to it.

1556
01:46:27,714 --> 01:46:29,924
Cheers.
- Here's to you, Georgie.

1557
01:46:30,092 --> 01:46:31,592
Cheers.

1558
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,344
- Here's to you, George.
Cheers.

1559
01:46:33,512 --> 01:46:35,137
All right, fellas.

1560
01:46:36,681 --> 01:46:37,723
- Dulli?
- Yeah.

1561
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:39,850
How about another round?
I'm gonna hit the head.

1562
01:46:40,018 --> 01:46:41,352
Okay.

1563
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:45,564
I feel like a fucking kid today.

1564
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,163
What?

1565
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,499
I feel bad.

1566
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:05,668
Me too.

1567
01:47:07,045 --> 01:47:08,879
I like him too, but what's done is done.

1568
01:47:09,047 --> 01:47:11,424
So let's not get all sentimental about it,
all right?

1569
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:23,686
Hey, Dulli, you know
what I was thinking?

1570
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:26,772
I was... I was remembering that, uh...
That time we flew in to Mexico.

1571
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,649
You remember that fucking landing strip?

1572
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:30,693
- Right?
- Hmm, yeah.

1573
01:47:30,861 --> 01:47:32,736
Fucking nuts.

1574
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:35,865
You're much better now.

1575
01:47:43,206 --> 01:47:44,707
What's going on?

1576
01:47:45,667 --> 01:47:49,253
What the fuck? What's, uh...?
What's with the long faces?

1577
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:52,298
Huh?

1578
01:47:56,219 --> 01:47:58,554
Where's my fucking knife?

1579
01:48:20,577 --> 01:48:22,036
No.

1580
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:34,256
Let's do it.

1581
01:48:49,606 --> 01:48:51,565
I was busted.

1582
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:54,693
Set up by the FBI and the DEA.

1583
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:56,779
That didn't bother me.

1584
01:48:56,947 --> 01:49:00,115
Set up by Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal
to save their own asses.

1585
01:49:00,283 --> 01:49:02,076
That didn't bother me.

1586
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:05,329
Sentenced to 60 years at Otisville.

1587
01:49:05,497 --> 01:49:07,414
That didn't bother me.

1588
01:49:10,669 --> 01:49:13,045
I'd broken a promise.

1589
01:49:14,005 --> 01:49:17,132
Everything I love in my life goes away.

1590
01:49:29,771 --> 01:49:31,814
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hey, Arch.

1591
01:49:31,982 --> 01:49:33,482
What's going on?

1592
01:49:33,692 --> 01:49:35,818
Well, ahem...

1593
01:49:39,114 --> 01:49:40,155
You all right?

1594
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:41,907
I'm good.

1595
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:46,036
Fuck.

1596
01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:51,542
What do you got?

1597
01:49:52,669 --> 01:49:54,336
Bad news.

1598
01:49:54,879 --> 01:49:58,841
Tried to get you furloughed,
but, uh, your mom squashed it.

1599
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:03,387
Said, uh, would only upset him.

1600
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:06,932
So, um, doesn't look good.

1601
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:16,150
How's he doing?

1602
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:18,569
Not good.

1603
01:50:18,862 --> 01:50:21,530
He's out of the hospital.
He's home, but, uh...

1604
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:25,284
...I don't think there's anything
anyone can do for him.

1605
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:27,703
It's just a matter of time.

1606
01:50:31,166 --> 01:50:32,791
Got you a tape recorder.

1607
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:34,418
I thought, uh...

1608
01:50:35,253 --> 01:50:37,212
...you know,
might wanna hear your voice.

1609
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:39,381
If you wanna say something to him.

1610
01:50:40,425 --> 01:50:41,884
Right.

1611
01:50:42,052 --> 01:50:43,802
I'll give you five.

1612
01:51:14,542 --> 01:51:16,251
Hello, Dad.

1613
01:51:20,382 --> 01:51:22,883
You know, I remember a lifetime ago...

1614
01:51:23,051 --> 01:51:25,678
...I was about 3 and a half feet tall...

1615
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:30,182
...weighing all of 60 pounds,
but every inch your son.

1616
01:51:32,227 --> 01:51:35,145
Those Saturday mornings
going to work with my dad...

1617
01:51:35,313 --> 01:51:39,191
...and we'd climb into
that big green truck.

1618
01:51:39,901 --> 01:51:44,571
I thought that truck was the biggest
truck in the universe, Pop.

1619
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:48,409
I remember how important
the job we did was.

1620
01:51:48,576 --> 01:51:50,661
How, if it weren't for us...

1621
01:51:50,995 --> 01:51:53,122
...people would freeze to death.

1622
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:58,168
I thought you were the strongest man
in the world.

1623
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:02,589
Remember those home movies...

1624
01:52:02,757 --> 01:52:04,591
...when Mom would dress up
like Loretta Young?

1625
01:52:04,759 --> 01:52:07,136
Ice creams, football games.

1626
01:52:07,303 --> 01:52:09,263
Waino, the Tuna.

1627
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:13,684
Day I left for California only to come
home with the FBI chasing me.

1628
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:16,353
That FBI agent, Trout.

1629
01:52:16,521 --> 01:52:19,022
When he had to get on his knees
to put my boots on, you said:

1630
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:22,067
This is where you belong,
you son of a bitch.

1631
01:52:22,235 --> 01:52:24,528
Putting on Georgie's boots.

1632
01:52:25,655 --> 01:52:27,656
That was a good one, Dad.

1633
01:52:28,366 --> 01:52:30,325
That was really something.

1634
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:32,494
You remember that?

1635
01:52:35,373 --> 01:52:38,333
And that time you told me
that money wasn't real?

1636
01:52:39,836 --> 01:52:41,712
Well, old man...

1637
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:43,922
...I'm 42 years old...

1638
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:48,677
...and I finally realize
what you were trying to tell me...

1639
01:52:49,345 --> 01:52:51,805
...so many years ago.

1640
01:52:53,016 --> 01:52:55,267
I finally understand.

1641
01:52:59,355 --> 01:53:01,398
You're the best, Dad.

1642
01:53:02,942 --> 01:53:05,527
I just wish I could've done more for you.

1643
01:53:05,695 --> 01:53:07,571
Wish we had more time.

1644
01:53:09,324 --> 01:53:10,949
Anyway...

1645
01:53:14,454 --> 01:53:17,039
...may the wind always be at your back...

1646
01:53:17,373 --> 01:53:20,000
...and the sun always upon your face.

1647
01:53:20,835 --> 01:53:23,587
And the winds of destiny
to carry you aloft...

1648
01:53:23,755 --> 01:53:26,006
...to dance with the stars.

1649
01:53:34,432 --> 01:53:36,183
I love you, Dad.

1650
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:39,102
Love, George.

1651
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:02,543
George.

1652
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:05,879
George, come on. You have a visitor.

1653
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:35,284
Hello, sweetheart.

1654
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:41,123
Hi, Daddy.

1655
01:54:44,043 --> 01:54:46,128
God, you're so big.

1656
01:54:52,927 --> 01:54:54,678
Daddy's a fuckup.

1657
01:54:56,973 --> 01:54:58,473
No.

1658
01:55:02,353 --> 01:55:03,812
Come here.

1659
01:55:08,735 --> 01:55:11,820
You're the only thing in my life
that ever meant anything.

1660
01:55:11,988 --> 01:55:13,155
You swear?

1661
01:55:13,323 --> 01:55:15,365
I swear, baby.

1662
01:55:16,618 --> 01:55:18,327
I swear.

1663
01:55:18,995 --> 01:55:21,288
I love you, Kristina.

1664
01:55:22,624 --> 01:55:25,250
You're the only good thing in my life.

1665
01:55:25,668 --> 01:55:28,086
You're the only thing
that ever meant anything to me.

1666
01:55:29,839 --> 01:55:31,673
I love you.

1667
01:55:41,517 --> 01:55:43,435
Come on. Let's go.

1668
01:55:50,234 --> 01:55:52,611
So tell me about your life.

1669
01:55:53,529 --> 01:55:54,947
What do you wanna know?

1670
01:55:55,114 --> 01:55:56,949
Everything. I mean...

1671
01:55:57,825 --> 01:55:59,993
...what do you do? You go to school?
You...?

1672
01:56:00,161 --> 01:56:01,203
Sometimes.

1673
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:02,496
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1674
01:56:02,664 --> 01:56:05,457
- Just like the old man.
- Yeah.

1675
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:07,793
George!

1676
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:10,170
Let's go. It's getting dark.

1677
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:13,340
Come on. It's getting late.

1678
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:18,762
Come on, let's go.

1679
01:56:23,309 --> 01:56:24,810
Let's go.

1680
01:56:26,646 --> 01:56:28,480
I got a visitor.

1681
01:56:28,690 --> 01:56:29,898
Not today, George.

1682
01:56:30,066 --> 01:56:31,733
Time to go back.

1683
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:34,861
Yeah, but l...

1684
01:56:35,029 --> 01:56:38,073
I wanna put her on the list for tomorrow.

1685
01:56:38,241 --> 01:56:39,324
My daughter.

1686
01:56:39,492 --> 01:56:41,159
Okay, George.

1687
01:56:42,578 --> 01:56:44,955
She's gonna visit me.
My daughter's gonna visit me tomorrow.

1688
01:56:45,123 --> 01:56:47,916
So in the end, was it worth it?

1689
01:56:48,084 --> 01:56:49,251
It's lockdown time.

1690
01:56:49,419 --> 01:56:51,586
Jesus Christ.

1691
01:56:52,005 --> 01:56:55,215
How irreparably changed
my life has become.

1692
01:56:55,383 --> 01:56:58,260
It's always the last day of summer
and I've been left out in the cold...

1693
01:56:58,428 --> 01:57:00,804
...with no door to get back in.

1694
01:57:01,597 --> 01:57:05,308
I'll grant you, I've had more
than my share of poignant moments.

1695
01:57:05,476 --> 01:57:09,938
Life passes most people by
while they're making grand plans for it.

1696
01:57:10,773 --> 01:57:12,607
Throughout my lifetime...

1697
01:57:12,775 --> 01:57:15,277
...I've left pieces of my heart
here and there.

1698
01:57:15,445 --> 01:57:18,613
And now there's almost not enough
to stay alive.

1699
01:57:19,115 --> 01:57:20,907
But I force a smile...

1700
01:57:21,075 --> 01:57:25,287
...knowing that my ambition
far exceeded my talent.

1701
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:28,707
There are no more white horses...

1702
01:57:28,875 --> 01:57:31,460
...or pretty ladies at my door.

1703
01:57:32,305 --> 01:58:32,683
