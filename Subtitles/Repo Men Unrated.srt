REMY: What do l remember?

8
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,636
I remember reading
about a scientist.

9
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,642
He had a thing
for cats and boxes.

10
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,106
What he'd do
is take a cat and
lock it in a box.

11
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,152
And then, just to
make things interesting,

12
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:14,073
he'd also put
this machine in there
that released poison gas.

13
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,496
Now, the scientist
didn't actually know

14
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,248
when the machine
would release the poison

15
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,167
and when it wouldn't.

16
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,544
The only way
he could tell for sure

17
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,212
was to look inside the box.

18
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,967
Here's the science bit.

19
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:37,263
Until he opened it up,
he figured the cat
had to be alive

20
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,056
and dead.

21
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,351
See, if either one
was possible,

22
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,313
then both had to be
possible, too.

about that cat,

out of my head.
