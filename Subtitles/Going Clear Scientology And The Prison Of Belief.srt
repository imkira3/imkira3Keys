00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,490
<i>We will begin the session now.</i>

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,890
<i>You will remain aware
of everything that goes on.</i>

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,160
<i>Okay.</i>

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,110
<i>We're going to find
an incident in your life</i>

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,900
<i>You have
an exact record of.</i>

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,370
<i>Then by sending you through it
at the time it happened,</i>

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,670
<i>We're going
to reduce it.</i>

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,170
<i>We will reduce the pain.</i>

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,180
<i>Go to the beginning
of that incident.</i>

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,710
<i>Tell me what's happening.</i>

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,300
<i>Well, these things
get all so...</i>

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,710
<i>I joined in 198--</i>

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,800
<i>It was a bunch of young kids,
like i was young...</i>

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,300
<i>We were all very heated,
very excited about this.</i>

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,390
<i>Can you recall a time
when you were happy?</i>

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,940
<i>I think the first time i saw
hubbard, and i was in awe...</i>

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,030
<i>We did, because you thought
we were doing good.</i>

19
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,730
<i>I mean, so you had
some gratification.</i>

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,780
<i>I felt a tremendous amount
of relief.</i>

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,900
<i>I got the answers
for everything</i>

22
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,200
<i>Within the religion.</i>

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,070
<i>What are you most afraid of?</i>

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,040
<i> It was dark.
3:00 in the morning,</i>

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,780
<i>There's a knock
on the hotel-room door.</i>

26
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,740
<i>Stop! I'll say whatever
you want,</i>

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,250
<i>I'll write up anything
that you want.</i>

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,460
<i> I flipped out.
I started punching holes
in the walls.</i>

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,720
<i>Things didn't seem quite right.</i>

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,290
<i>And you just feel
so foolish at that point.</i>

31
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,140
<i>Do you have a secret
you're afraid i'll find out?</i>

32
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,640
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,400
<i>Go to the beginning
of that incident.</i>

34
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,430
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

35
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,970
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

36
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,990
<i>I was 21 years old,</i>

37
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,690
<i>Living in london,
ontario, canada.</i>

38
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,820
I wanted to be
a documentary filmmaker.

39
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,990
And someone had told me

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,410
About what they called--
they said, "there's this cult

41
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,920
"in new york
called scientology,"

42
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,320
Which i'd never heard of.

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,150
"and if you give them
all your money,

44
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,860
"they'll make anything
possible in your life."

45
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,430
<i>And about six months later,
i was walking down the street.</i>

46
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,000
<i>This guy was there
selling books.</i>

47
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,030
<i>And i realized
they were all the same book--</i>

48
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,830
"dianetics,"

49
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,300
Which again,
i had never heard of.

50
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,610
He handed me one
and asked me to look at it.

51
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,690
He was talking.
I wasn't really listening
to him.

52
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,890
I opened the cover
and it said--

53
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,010
Stamped on the inside page,
it said "church of scientology."

54
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,650
And i said,
"take me there."

55
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,820
<i> All right.
All right, here we go.</i>

56
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,820
<i>I'm not a great multitasker.</i>

57
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,540
You know, and if i feel
like doing something,
that's what i do.

58
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,500
And, uh,
i was into this shit,

59
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,750
And i was becoming
an auditor.

60
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,300
Like, i was in scientology
probably four months,

61
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,720
And i had done more
than john travolta had done,

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,610
And he'd been there
for 85 years or some shit.

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,880
My agents called, you know,
"you got an audition."

64
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,520
"eh, fuck it, i don't really--"
you know what i mean?

65
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,550
I was on--
i'm on a spiritual adventure,

66
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,660
And this was like, "whoa,
this is an interesting road."

67
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,690
You know?

68
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,280
So, uh,
what was the question?

69
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,920
<i> So tell me,
how was it you first
got involved in scientology?</i>

70
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,870
<i>Well, i was introduced to it
by some friends.</i>

71
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,920
I don't know if they said it
or if it was just talked about

72
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,120
By others that
they had super powers.

73
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,180
And i-- i was, like,
really young,

74
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,760
But i thought, "i'd like
to have super powers!"

75
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,020
But also i had done
so much...

76
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,190
Political-social work.

77
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,860
<i>So this really looked like--
that it was a solution</i>

78
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,860
<i>To handling a lot
of the world's problems.</i>

79
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,560
<i>Instead of trying
to handle things en masse,</i>

80
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,200
You could deal with it
person by person,

81
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,400
Make each person better,
and thus the world would
get better and surer.

82
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,780
Well, thank you very much,

83
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,950
And welcome
to our whole new world.

84
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,790
It's a world where
the operative phrase reads...

85
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,970
"exceeding all expectations,

86
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,090
"transcending all parameters,

87
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,060
"extending the boundaries
beyond any boundary,

88
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,680
"not to mention
godspeed, lightning speed,

89
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,300
"and a quantum leap
in sheer rapidity of progress
up the bridge."

90
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,380
<i>We're out to make every life
extraordinary.</i>

91
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,480
And if by chance
it ever seems laborious
or a sacrifice,

92
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,200
Then you are looking
at the offramps instead
of the highway.

93
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,590
You are missing
the signpost up ahead,

94
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,760
The one that reads,
"next stop, infinity."

95
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,680
<i>Probably my favorite concept
of scientology</i>

96
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,020
Is a world
without criminality,

97
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,270
A world without war,
and a world without insanity.

98
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,610
And i know
of no other group

99
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,560
That their goals
are that clear.

100
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,070
Look, i don't--
you name me another philosophy,

101
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,540
Religion, or technology

102
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,040
That one of its main goals--
besides the three
i mentioned earlier--

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,360
Where joy
is the operative concept.

104
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,660
<i></i>

105
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,880
These are
the times now, people.

106
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,510
Okay? These are the times
we will all remember.

107
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,340
Were you there?

108
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,560
What did you do?

109
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,150
So what do you say?
Can we clean this place up?

110
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,480
Yeah!

111
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,650
Okay.
Because we're counting on you.

112
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,570
okay?

113
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,820
All right?
To lrh!

114
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,060
Hip-hip--
Hooray!

115
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,360
Hip-hip--
Hooray!

116
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,200
Hip-hip--
Hooray!

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
<i>Scientology is such a subject
of fascination for people.</i>

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,710
How did you get engaged
in the story?

119
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,960
Well, i've always
been interested in religions

120
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,760
And why people believe
one idea rather than another.

121
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,320
<i>I've studied jonestown,
radical islam.</i>

122
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,120
<i>They're oftentimes
good-hearted people--</i>

123
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,590
Idealistic, but full of
a kind of crushing certainty

124
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,430
That eliminates doubt.

125
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,310
You know, my goal
wasn't to write an exposÃƒÂ©.

126
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,950
It was simply
to understand scientology,

127
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,490
Trying to understand
what people get out of it.

128
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,600
You know, why do they
go into it in the first place?

129
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,460
<i>I was
interested in intelligent
and skeptical people</i>

130
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,880
<i>Who are drawn
into a belief system</i>

131
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,050
<i>And wind up acting
on those beliefs</i>

132
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,670
<i>In ways they never
thought they would.</i>

133
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,590
<i>The church of scientology
turned out to be</i>

134
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,800
<i>Two offices
above a woolworth's store.</i>

135
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,480
He asked me,
"what's ruining your life?"

136
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,300
I said,
"oh, i'm in love.

137
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,240
"i'm in love with this woman.
It's impossible.

138
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,020
"i don't know what to do.
I need some help."

139
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,660
And he said,
"we can help you with that."

140
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,330
I said, "really?"
"yes."

141
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,310
<i>And i ran home and got her,
and i said, "we have to
sign up for this.</i>

142
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,160
<i>"it sounds really good.
It could save
our relationship."</i>

143
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,780
<i>So we both signed up
the next day to do a course,</i>

144
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,450
<i>Which i think cost $50.</i>

145
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,320
<i>The thing that
absolutely got me</i>

146
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,790
<i>And stayed with me forever</i>

147
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,880
<i>Was the very first thing
i read when you open
the course pack,</i>

148
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,960
<i>And it said--
i'm paraphrasing--</i>

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,830
<i>"don't believe any of this.
If it works for you, great.</i>

150
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,330
<i>"if it doesn't, discard it."</i>

151
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,690
I was troubled by the fact
that they called it a religion,

152
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,340
But i figured,
"oh, it's some tax scam.
It's fine with me.

153
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,890
"i don't really care about that
as long as it works."

154
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,110
The first exercise,
after you do all this reading
and stuff like that,

155
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,400
Is this thing called
o-t-t-r-0,

156
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,850
Which is basically,
you stand-- you sit

157
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,370
Just like this,
eyes closed,

158
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,490
Three feet away
from somebody who's
doing the same thing,

159
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,580
And you basically
confront them.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,250
You know?

161
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,050
And in scientology lingo,

162
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,040
I went exterior.

163
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,540
Exteriorizing
is what they call it.

164
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,480
You know,
you leave your body.

165
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,720
So it was a... Transcendent
experience for me.,

166
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,240
And that made me go,
"holy fucking shit,

167
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,360
"this is-- wow."

168
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,560
I was reading books,
going to lectures,
and going to things--

169
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,330
Different events
at the mission-- at the local
santa clara mission.

170
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,060
And then i knew
i wanted to join the sea org

171
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,950
<i>And get really involved
as soon as i could,</i>

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,370
<i>Which would
be right out of high school.</i>

173
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,920
<i>Sea org
is the most fraternal order
of the organization.</i>

174
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,240
<i>It's people who really,
really believe in the cause</i>

175
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,930
<i>And sign
a billion-year contract,</i>

176
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,600
Which i did when i was--
you know, as soon as i could.

177
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,690
I left skid marks getting
to that billion-year contract.

178
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,420
<i>You thought
you were doing something good,</i>

179
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,480
<i>To have a positive effect
on all of mankind.</i>

180
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,930
That's what howard says.

181
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,700
Everything you do for endless
trillions of years

182
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,070
Depends on what you do
here and now within
scientology.

183
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
<i>I began to ask this question,</i>

184
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,410
<i>"what is man?"
and i found, oddly enough,</i>

185
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,670
<i>That nobody could tell me
what man was.</i>

186
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,790
<i>What did he consist of?
Where was he going?</i>

187
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,810
<i>What was he doing?</i>

188
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,460
To really know life,
you've got to be part of life.

189
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,980
You must get down and look.

190
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,460
You must get into
the nooks and crannies
of existence,

191
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,400
The-- you have to rub elbows

192
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,520
With all kinds
and types of men

193
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,070
Before you can finally
establish what he is.

194
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,910
And you in fact did this?

195
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,940
Yes, i've slept
with bandits in mongolia,

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,860
And i've hunted
with, uh,

197
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,950
Pygmies in the philippines.

198
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,820
Matter of fact,
i've studied 21 different
primitive races,

199
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,760
Including the white race.

200
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,000
<i>And my conclusions were</i>

201
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,500
That man is
a spiritual being

202
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,470
That was pulled down
to the material,

203
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,170
<i>The fleshly interests,</i>

204
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,340
<i>To an interplay in life
that was, in fact,</i>

205
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,560
<i>Too great for him
to confront.</i>

206
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,860
<i>And i concluded, finally,</i>

207
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,900
<i>That he needed a hand.</i>

208
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,690
<i>To understand scientology,</i>

209
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,330
<i>You have to understand
the life and mind
of its inventor,</i>

210
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,880
<i>L. Ron hubbard.</i>

211
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,410
<i>Hubbard was
a prolific writer.</i>

212
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,830
<i>He actually holds
the "guinness book
of world records"</i>

213
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,530
<i>For the number of books
published--</i>

214
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,340
<i>More than 1,000.</i>

215
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,890
<i>Hubbard got his start
in the depression writing
pulp fiction,</i>

216
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,760
<i>Named for
the cheap paper used.</i>

217
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,890
<i>Writers were paid
a penny a word,</i>

218
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,710
<i>So hey had to write a lot
to make money.</i>

219
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,730
<i>Hubbard hammered away
so fast</i>

220
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,570
<i>On long rolls
of butcher paper</i>

221
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,220
<i>That he used to drop sweat
on his typewriter.</i>

222
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,330
<i>Hubbard's career took off
when he began to write
for a magazine</i>

223
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,110
<i>Called "astounding
science fiction."</i>

224
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,830
<i>Along with authors
like isaac asimov
and robert heinlein,</i>

225
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,000
<i>Hubbard wrote stories
with a sense of mission--</i>

226
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,000
<i>To get man to the stars.</i>

227
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,090
<i>He found his true mÃƒÂ©tier
in science fiction.</i>

228
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,550
And a lot of
what scientology is

229
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,180
<i>He had previously written about
in the form</i>

230
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,050
<i>Of his science fiction.</i>

231
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,110
<i>He had the ability
to fabricate these
amazing tales,</i>

232
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,780
<i>And he transported
those imaginary stories</i>

233
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,450
<i>Into his theology.</i>

234
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,410
<i> After pearl harbor,
hubbard took command
of a sub chaser,</i>

235
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,240
<i>But he was still a man
prone to invention.</i>

236
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,610
<i>He would write that he sunk
two japanese subs,</i>

237
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,920
<i>But, in fact,
just off the coast of oregon,</i>

238
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,620
<i>He opened fire on what
turned out to be a log</i>

239
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
<i>And dropped most of
his depth chargers</i>

240
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,890
<i>On underwater
magnetic rocks.</i>

241
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,460
<i>When he accidentally shelled
a mexican island,</i>

242
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,650
<i>He was relieved
of his command.</i>

243
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,630
<i>After the war,</i>

244
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,180
<i>Hubbard ended up
in los angeles</i>

245
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,640
<i>Where he settled in
with a small group
of seekers and visionaries.</i>

246
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,690
A guy named jack parsons,
a fascinating man,

247
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,240
<i>Was one of the founders
of the jet-propulsion
laboratory.</i>

248
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,750
<i>And there's actually
a crater on the moon
named after jack.</i>

249
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,620
<i>He was a significant
scientific figure,</i>

250
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,920
But he was also
the head honcho

251
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,290
In this black magic cult.

252
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,820
<i>It was called the o.T.O.,</i>

253
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,330
<i>Or the ordo templi orientis.</i>

254
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,050
<i>They followed the teachings
of aleister crowley,</i>

255
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,300
<i>A famous sexual magic figure
in england.</i>

256
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,640
<i>Parsons had a mansion
in pasadena.</i>

257
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,520
<i>They would have ceremonies,</i>

258
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,230
<i>And they were seeking
some sort of goddess figure</i>

259
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,010
<i>That he could impregnate</i>

260
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,650
<i>In order to create
the antichrist.</i>

261
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,400
<i>Hubbard moved in
and became parsons' assistant.</i>

262
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,650
<i>One night,
this beautiful redhead</i>

263
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,820
<i>Named marjorie cameron
showed up at the door.</i>

264
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,240
<i>She was perfectly
willing to engage
in this sexual ritual</i>

265
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,710
<i>In order, supposedly,
to produce the antichrist.</i>

266
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,920
<i>She and jack
eventually got married.</i>

267
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,300
<i>That happened after hubbard
ran off with jack's girlfriend,</i>

268
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,170
<i>Sara northrup.</i>

269
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,510
<i> Scientology
and hubbard</i>

270
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,040
<i>Would later refuse
to acknowledge</i>

271
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
<i>His relationship
with sara.</i>

272
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,510
<i>But we uncovered
sara's own recollections</i>

273
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,680
<i>Of her time with hubbard.</i>

274
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,290
<i>He was 13 years older
than i was.</i>

275
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,570
<i>I thought
he was a great war hero,</i>

276
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,230
<i>A captain of a ship
that had been downed
in the pacific.</i>

277
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,500
<i>And he was weeks
on a raft,</i>

278
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,400
<i>And he'd been blinded
by the sun,</i>

279
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,580
<i>And his back
had been broken.</i>

280
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,730
<i>All these things
were complete lies,</i>

281
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,000
<i>But i didn't know it
at the time.</i>

282
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,310
<i>I believed
every word of it.</i>

283
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,760
<i>If only sara had seen
hubbard's military records.</i>

284
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,680
<i>In a 900-page file,</i>

285
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,380
<i>Hubbard's activities are laid
out in extraordinary detail.</i>

286
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,080
<i>Hubbard told people
that he had been blinded
and crippled</i>

287
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,550
<i>During the war,
and the practices
that would form</i>

288
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,760
<i>The basis of scientology
had cured him.</i>

289
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,030
<i>But his records show
that his only wounds</i>

290
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,200
<i>Were mild arthritis
and conjunctivitis.</i>

291
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,200
<i>We had this terrible fight,</i>

292
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,940
<i>And he told me he was going
to commit suicide</i>

293
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,940
<i>If i didn't marry him.</i>

294
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,160
<i>I really believed him,</i>

295
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,630
<i>So we got married.</i>

296
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,800
<i>We spent the winter
in that lighthouse on the lake
in the poconos.</i>

297
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,750
<i>I remember one awful night,</i>

298
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,250
<i>When i was asleep
and he was out typing...
</i>

299
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,960
<i>
and he hit me
across the side of the head</i>

300
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,590
<i>With a .45...
</i>

301
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,100
<i>Because i was smiling
in my sleep,</i>

302
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,810
<i>And he said i was thinking
about somebody else.</i>

303
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,270
<i>I got up,
left the house,</i>

304
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,570
<i>And walked
on the ice of the lake.</i>

305
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,770
<i>I was terrified.</i>

306
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,570
<i>He always said
that he would kill me</i>

307
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,910
<i>Rather than
let me leave him.</i>

308
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,750
<i>The only good thing
i got from ron</i>

309
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,000
<i>Was my baby.</i>

310
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,420
<i>We moved
to elizabeth, new jersey,</i>

311
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,830
<i>And he started
writing "dianetics."</i>

312
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,960
<i>The book was conceived</i>

313
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,330
<i>And he started
working on it in 1950.</i>

314
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,690
<i>He said many times
that the only way to make
any real money</i>

315
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,300
<i>Was to have a religion.</i>

316
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,860
<i>That's essentially
what he was trying to do
with "dianetics"--</i>

317
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,060
<i>Get a religion where
he could have an income</i>

318
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,480
<i>And the government wouldn't
take it away from him</i>

319
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,650
<i>In the form of taxes.</i>

320
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,850
<i>"dianetics" was
an immense success.</i>

321
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,710
<i>From the moment
it was published in 1950,</i>

322
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,960
<i>It swept through america
and other countries
around the world.</i>

323
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,080
This book--
that's the background
of all of this.

324
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,380
That's what started
all the trouble.

325
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,800
<i>We expected this to sell
about 6,000 copies,</i>

326
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,870
<i>And it hit the top
of the bestseller list
of "the new york times"</i>

327
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,510
<i>And just stayed there,
month in, month out.</i>

328
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,710
It was like
i started an avalanche.

329
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,710
<i>The modern science
of mental health"</i>

330
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,770
Is considered to be
the fundamental text,

331
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,460
Which is the foundation
upon which all else is built.

332
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,530
<i>One of the theories
of "dianetics"</i>

333
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,230
Is to discover these things
that are very traumatic

334
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,030
Or have been very upsetting
to you,

335
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:09,040
<i>And if you can observe</i>

336
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,260
<i>Exactly what happened,</i>

337
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,240
<i>The power of that incident</i>

338
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,290
To influence you today

339
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,600
Is removed.

340
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,850
<i>The concept of "dianetics"</i>

341
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,850
<i>Is that you have
two sides of your mind.</i>

342
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,350
<i>There is the analytical side,</i>

343
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,690
<i>Which is a perfect computer.</i>

344
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,260
It remembers everything.
It's flawless.

345
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,280
<i>It never makes a mistake.</i>

346
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,760
<i>And then there's
a reactive side.</i>

347
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,120
<i>And this is where
all your neuroses, anxieties,</i>

348
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,400
<i>And fears are stored.</i>

349
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,770
<i>And where do they come from?
They come from engrams.</i>

350
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,990
<i>An engram
is like a memory.</i>

351
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,910
<i>A man has
an automobile accident.</i>

352
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,660
<i>He has a picture
of an automobile accident.</i>

353
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,610
<i>He has all the sensations
of having been hurt</i>

354
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,280
In the automobile accident.
It takes him a long time
to recover,

355
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Because he's still wearing
the automobile accident.

356
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,550
<i>If you said,
"hey, why don't you take</i>

357
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,760
<i>"this automobile accident
and throw it away?"</i>

358
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,310
<i>Well, all of a sudden,
he recovers</i>

359
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,340
<i>From the automobile accident,
naturally,</i>

360
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,640
<i>Because the thing that's
keeping it impressed upon him</i>

361
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,100
<i>And his body
is his mind.</i>

362
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,100
<i>An auditor is a practitioner
in scientology.</i>

363
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,800
He listens
and he computes.

364
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,160
<i>We have a meter.</i>

365
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,480
<i>A meter simply shows</i>

366
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,950
<i>Where an individual
is aberrated.</i>

367
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,200
<i>The e-meter is
a very powerful instrument.</i>

368
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,620
<i>It's one-third
of a lie detector.</i>

369
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,650
<i>A lie detector would also
measure your respiration
and pulse.</i>

370
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,170
<i>There's two cans</i>

371
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,760
<i>And there's electrical wires</i>

372
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,960
<i>Carrying an undetectable
amount of current</i>

373
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,380
<i>Into a meter
with a needle on it.</i>

374
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,970
<i>According to the church
of scientology,</i>

375
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,140
<i>It actually detects
the mass of your thoughts,</i>

376
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,610
Although there's no evidence
that thoughts have mass.

377
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,010
The current
passes through your body,

378
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,030
<i>And as your mental mass
increases,</i>

379
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,280
<i>So does the resistance
to the circuit.</i>

380
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,070
<i>So the auditor will
ask you a question,</i>

381
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,400
"tell me about
an upset with your mother."

382
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,240
"what's truly bothering you
about being with, you know,

383
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,380
"with your wife's behavior?
What is it?"

384
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,030
"why are you upset today?"

385
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,630
"well, i had a fight
with my wife."

386
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,380
"well, i can see."

387
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,300
"that there--
was that the same thought?"

388
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,470
"say that again."

389
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,300
<i>And gradually, the needle
will have less response.</i>

390
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,420
<i>And in that manner,
you discharge the emotion.</i>

391
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,880
<i>Then you're asked to go back
to earlier incidents</i>

392
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
<i>That were like that.</i>

393
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,220
<i>And you might say,
"well, my mother spoke to me</i>

394
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,400
<i>"in the same
scolding tone of voice."</i>

395
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
And you recount that story,

396
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,890
<i>And eventually,
you discharge the emotion.</i>

397
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,060
<i>And that's very much
like freudian therapy.</i>

398
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,700
<i>But with scientology,</i>

399
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,030
<i>Then they'll ask further.</i>

400
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,030
<i>"well, that's as far back
as i go."</i>

401
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,590
Well, maybe not.

402
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,840
<i>The auditor might say,
"something just registered
on the meter.</i>

403
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,380
<i>"what was that?"</i>

404
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,740
<i>"i had an image
in my mind."</i>

405
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,460
<i>"well, what was the image?"</i>

406
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,180
<i>"it was a barn."</i>

407
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,720
<i>"are you inside the barn?
Go back to that image.</i>

408
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,600
<i>"okay, open the door.
What do you see?"</i>

409
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,690
<i>"well, it looks like
19th century france."</i>

410
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,230
<i>You walk outside
and you see</i>

411
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,900
<i>The people dressed
in their costumes,</i>

412
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,950
<i>And the e-meter is
saying this is real.</i>

413
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,600
<i>This is a real memory.</i>

414
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,240
<i>It's just as real
as those other memories
that you had.</i>

415
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,490
<i>Beautiful little soft needle,
and everything's good.</i>

416
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,630
Needle's rising, which means
he's getting, you know,

417
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,500
Thinking a lot.
The needle just, like,
goes "pfft,"

418
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,590
<i>Like a lot of shit
blows away.</i>

419
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,510
The theta bop,
which is a very quick little
thing like, "doo doo doo,"

420
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,760
Which means
exteriorization.

421
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,900
<i>When you come out
of an auditing session,</i>

422
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,520
You feel euphoric.

423
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,150
That confessional nature
makes you feel better.

424
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,860
Somebody would say,
"oh, you're going
to have a session."

425
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,860
I would feel better
just hearing that.

426
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,980
<i>Man is asleep.</i>

427
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,150
<i>He is hypnotized.</i>

428
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,420
<i>Now in scientology,
reverse the process,</i>

429
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,920
<i>And you'll make him
wake up.</i>

430
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,670
<i>Such a man
becomes un-brainwashed,
you might say.</i>

431
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,420
<i>He becomes unhypnotized.</i>

432
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,490
<i>This sounds, mr. Hubbard,
in a sense,</i>

433
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,050
<i>Like an extension
of psychology
or psychiatry.</i>

434
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,680
Oh, no, psychiatry
has to do with the insane,

435
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,640
And we have nothing to do
with the insane whatsoever.

436
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,940
Is this is a form
of psychoanalysis?

437
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,020
No, psychoanalysis,
they lay back and--

438
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,610
Don't associate scientology
with such people.

439
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,030
That's terrible.
That's bad manners, you know?

440
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,700
<i>When l. Ron hubbard
first wrote "dianetics,"</i>

441
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,400
<i>He thought it was
a tremendous psychological
breakthrough,</i>

442
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,820
<i>So much so
that he would be recognized.</i>

443
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,880
<i>He wrote letters to
the american psychological
association.</i>

444
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,700
<i>They couldn't make heads
or tail of his ideas.</i>

445
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,880
To them, it was like
psychological folk art.

446
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,420
<i>For instance,
he would talk about "clear."</i>

447
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,090
<i>That means that
the individual</i>

448
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,230
<i>Has erased
his reactive mind--</i>

449
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,600
<i>His unconscious mind
is gone--</i>

450
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,900
And he is totally alert

451
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,900
And totally capable.

452
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,220
Once you've taken away
all these traumatic memories,

453
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,860
From this life
and previous ones,

454
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,360
Then you are clear.

455
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,190
Someone who had
a perfect memory,

456
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,080
Who was never ill.

457
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,830
Your eyesight
would be better.

458
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,030
We tested people
before scientology processing

459
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,870
And after
scientology processing,

460
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,590
And uniformly found
that their iq had raised.

461
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,670
<i>We are making
such individuals,</i>

462
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,380
<i>We're making them regularly,
and we're making
them routinely.</i>

463
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,180
<i>An overt act
is an effort to individuate.</i>

464
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,930
<i>It is a withhold
of oneself...</i>

465
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,920
<i>Ron gave lectures
everywhere</i>

466
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,940
<i>For large amounts of money,
and money just started
pouring in.</i>

467
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,230
<i>I mean, these people
were paying</i>

468
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,280
<i>$500 apiece
in the 1950s</i>

469
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,280
<i>For training
in "dianetics."</i>

470
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,030
<i>I felt that he was stealing
from people</i>

471
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,290
<i>And that he was
hoodwinking them.</i>

472
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,290
<i>All the business of sitting,
holding hands,</i>

473
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,610
<i>And putting
all these false memories
into people's minds...</i>

474
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,000
<i>Then they would finally
come along and say,</i>

475
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,960
<i>"oh, yes,
i can remember it all."</i>

476
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,500
<i></i>

477
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,790
<i>We were surrounded
by sycophants.</i>

478
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,640
<i>He began to believe
that he was a savior and hero,</i>

479
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,150
<i>That he really was
this god figure.</i>

480
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,730
<i>He was absolutely convinced</i>

481
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,440
<i>That he had the cure
for the psychological ills
of mankind,</i>

482
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,140
<i>And that the only reason
that it wasn't being propagated
far and wide</i>

483
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,810
<i>Was that the medical profession
had a vested interest</i>

484
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,280
<i>In keeping people sick.</i>

485
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,280
<i>I think he was afraid
that some psychiatrists</i>

486
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,750
<i>Would pop him
into an institution.</i>

487
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:08,040
<i>He degenerated into
a really paranoid,</i>

488
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,820
<i>Terrifying person.</i>

489
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,880
<i>Sara threatened
to leave hubbard</i>

490
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,510
<i>Unless he got
psychiatric help.</i>

491
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,330
<i>He responded
by kidnapping their baby</i>

492
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,350
<i>And taking her to cuba.</i>

493
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,940
<i>He was incapable
of taking care of her,</i>

494
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,110
So he put her in the charge
of a mother and daughter

495
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,220
Who were both
mentally retarded.

496
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,610
And they apparently kept her
in some kind of cage.

497
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,610
<i>He called me and told me
that he had killed her.</i>

498
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,350
<i>He said he had cut her
into little pieces</i>

499
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,120
<i>And dropped the pieces
in a river,</i>

500
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,240
<i>And it was my fault.</i>

501
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,240
<i>Then he'd call me back
and say that she
was still alive.</i>

502
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,380
<i>And this went on
and on and on.</i>

503
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,210
<i>When hubbard came back
to the u.S.,</i>

504
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,550
<i>Sara persuaded him
to agree to a divorce</i>

505
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,830
<i>And give her custody
of their daughter.</i>

506
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,800
<i>When i left him,
he cleaned out</i>

507
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,250
<i>All the joint bank accounts</i>

508
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,390
<i>So that i wouldn't
have any money.</i>

509
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,590
<i>Hubbard soon lost
all his money, too.</i>

510
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,900
<i>"dianetics" proved
to be a passing fad,
like the hula hoop.</i>

511
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,570
<i>But hubbard still had
his imagination.</i>

512
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,850
<i>So he repackaged the ideas
of "dianetics"</i>

513
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,440
<i>Into a religion
called scientology.</i>

514
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,740
<i>Hubbard added more science
and more structure.</i>

515
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,530
<i>Along with the e-meters
came a payment plan.</i>

516
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,370
<i>Every step to "clear"
had a price tag.</i>

517
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,830
How would you describe
your business model?

518
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,120
Rapacious.

519
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,510
It's all about making money.

520
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,510
<i>Hubbard, from the beginning,
knew that</i>

521
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,950
<i>People would pay
for this counseling
at a pretty good clip,</i>

522
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,770
And so he continued
to come out with more
and more levels.

523
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,690
<i>The real money
was in paying for these
higher and higher courses.</i>

524
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
<i>They were getting
into thousands of dollars.</i>

525
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,030
<i>Those prices
kept going up and up.</i>

526
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,810
<i>That's really
where scientology begins</i>

527
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,900
To create
this indoctrination,

528
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,770
Is, "it's hubbard
that came up with that,

529
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,280
"only hubbard,
and you have to
be a part of our group

530
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,740
"to get
that spiritual satisfaction
you were looking for."

531
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,610
The hubbard college
of scientology,

532
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,080
Qualifications division,
department of certifications
and awards

533
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,950
Does hereby certify
that anthony a. Phillips

534
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,250
Has obtained
the state of clear.

535
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,390
<i> As more members
paid for hubbard's bridge
to total freedom,</i>

536
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,010
<i>The church's coffers
swelled with hundreds
of millions of dollars.</i>

537
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,960
<i>From the beginning,
hubbard tried to shelter
that revenue</i>

538
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,850
<i>From any government taxes.</i>

539
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,930
<i>The founding church
of scientology</i>

540
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,400
<i>Attempted in 1967 to get
a court determination</i>

541
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,770
<i>That it was exempt
from federal taxation</i>

542
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:40,310
<i>On the basis
that it was a nonprofit
religious organization.</i>

543
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,490
<i>A federal court denied
the founding church
tax exemption,</i>

544
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,980
<i>Saying that some
of the church's earnings
from 1955 to 1959</i>

545
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,920
<i>Were used for
the personal benefit
of private individuals--</i>

546
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,320
<i>L. Ron hubbard
and family.</i>

547
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,460
<i>"abc news" has repeatedly
requested interviews
with mr. Hubbard.</i>

548
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,960
<i>We have been told
that he is unavailable.</i>

549
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,180
<i>It was very exciting.</i>

550
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,570
It was that heady mix
of emotion and belief,

551
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,790
And it's--
you get stuck to it.

552
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,830
It's so strong
that it sticks you like glue,

553
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,090
And there's no way
you can get away from it.

554
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,260
<i>I was deeply convinced</i>

555
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,700
<i>That we were going
to save the world.</i>

556
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,250
I considered myself
tremendously fortunate

557
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,340
To be in that position.

558
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,380
<i>Out of the blue one day,</i>

559
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,260
<i>I received this envelope</i>

560
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,720
<i>With an invitation
to join the sea project.</i>

561
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,250
<i>It was completely
confidential.</i>

562
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,020
<i>I wasn't to tell anyone
about it,</i>

563
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,740
<i>And i was so ecstatic.</i>

564
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,580
<i>Here was a chance
to work with hubbard.</i>

565
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,110
<i>And i signed, "yes!"</i>

566
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:14,230
I was on my way
to the greatest adventure
in my life.

567
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:19,120
<i>We had an overnight flight
to las palmas in
the canary islands,</i>

568
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,880
<i>Where we found,
at about 6:00 in the morning,</i>

569
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,180
<i>We were taxied
down to a dock.</i>

570
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,930
<i>We had to climb up
this rickety ladder,</i>

571
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,220
<i>All the way up
to the ship,</i>

572
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,720
<i>And we couldn't believe
this was where we were going.</i>

573
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,060
<i>This ship
was a rusty hulk.</i>

574
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,560
<i>I was given a dirty
old jumpsuit to get into,</i>

575
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,360
<i>Missing one arm
and the other one was
almost half torn off,</i>

576
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,570
<i>And put to work.
We had to scrub the ship
and clean out the ship,</i>

577
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,210
<i>Which was arduous,
strenuous work,</i>

578
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,910
<i>In the heat.</i>

579
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,130
<i>Hubbard came
to the ship every day,</i>

580
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,250
<i>Smoking cigarettes
and surveying his kingdom.</i>

581
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,950
<i>After dinner,
he'd come and join us</i>

582
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,170
<i>On the well deck.</i>

583
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,450
There he was, you know,
right amongst us,

584
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,260
Talking to us.

585
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,010
<i>He would be
his most magnificent self</i>

586
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,400
<i>At those times.</i>

587
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,970
<i>He'd lean back,
he'd look up at the cosmos,</i>

588
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,350
<i>And he'd point out galaxies</i>

589
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,240
<i>And constellations,</i>

590
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,160
<i>And he'd say,
"the fifth invaders
are up there,</i>

591
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,080
<i>"and this is how they dressed
and this is how they talk.</i>

592
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,700
<i>"and see that blip
across the sky over there?"</i>

593
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,650
<i>He'd point it out,
and we were all,
"yes, we see it, we see it."</i>

594
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,000
<i>He'd say, "and that's one
of their space vessels..."</i>

595
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,490
<i>And there was-- the fourth
invader force was here.</i>

596
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,210
<i>The fifth invader force
came in.</i>

597
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,210
<i>And the name
of this solar system
is space station 33.</i>

598
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,930
<i>The fourth invader force
had been there</i>

599
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,220
<i>For god knows how many
skillion years,</i>

600
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,690
<i>Had been sitting down...</i>

601
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,050
<i>...And we'd sit there,
spellbound.</i>

602
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,390
<i>You could hear a pin drop
on that ship.</i>

603
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,110
<i>He had us emotionally
captured and held</i>

604
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:09,700
Right there
in the palm of his hand
where he wanted us.

605
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,990
He had us right there.

606
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,620
<i>In the early '60s,</i>

607
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,320
<i>Hubbard was
under investigation
in various countries.</i>

608
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,290
<i>His solution was to take
to the high seas.</i>

609
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,460
<i>He made himself commodore
of a fleet of three ships,</i>

610
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,400
<i>A scientology navy.</i>

611
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,220
<i>To crew the vessels,</i>

612
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,870
<i>He created
the sea organization.</i>

613
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,170
<i>The members of
this so-called sea org</i>

614
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,590
<i>Would become
the church's clergy.</i>

615
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,340
<i>They began going
from port to port</i>

616
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,260
In the mediterranean,
show up for a few days,

617
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,730
And then go off-- sail off
in some other direction.

618
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,220
And a very enterprising
reporter

619
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,390
For grenada television
in britain

620
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,720
Tracked him down...

621
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,490
Slate one,
take one.

622
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,530
<i>That's one
of the very few instances</i>

623
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,530
<i>Where hubbard has actually
appeared on camera.</i>

624
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,750
What are you actually doing

625
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,620
On this ship now?

626
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,740
I am studying
ancient civilizations,

627
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,170
Trying to find
what happened to them,

628
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,710
Finding out
why they went...

629
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,410
Into a decline,
why they died.

630
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,430
<i>Hubbard believed that
he had lived various lives</i>

631
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,440
<i>In the mediterranean area
as a venetian prince,</i>

632
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,770
As an italian prince.

633
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,640
As a matter of fact,
it's quite interesting

634
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,430
That exercises
can be conducted,

635
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,280
Which demonstrate conclusively
that there are memories

636
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,400
Which exist prior
to this life.

637
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,870
<i>He had buried treasure
all around the coastline,</i>

638
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:42,460
<i>And he wanted to go find
all these caches of treasure.</i>

639
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,750
<i>We were all very heated,
very excited about this.</i>

640
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,120
<i>Whatever was
his whim, we did.</i>

641
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,080
We would have died
for the old man.

642
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,790
<i>Don't you wake up
sometimes</i>

643
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,420
<i>In the middle of the night
and think to yourself,</i>

644
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,760
<i>"well, i've been on this ship
with a whole lot</i>

645
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,290
<i>"of scientologists
who believe i'm fantastic..."</i>

646
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,230
They don't believe
i'm fantastic.

647
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,980
If you saw the number of times
they don't follow my orders...

648
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,800
<i>Lrh started to devise</i>

649
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,740
<i>A system of penalties
or punishments</i>

650
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,360
<i>Or what he called ethics.</i>

651
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,280
<i>And one of the penalties
for the auditors</i>

652
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,500
<i>Making mistakes
in their auditing sessions</i>

653
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,700
<i>Was to be tossed
overboard.</i>

654
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,370
"you have done such and such
and such and such,

655
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,010
<i>"and we commit your errors
to the deep."</i>

656
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,290
<i>And then just pushed
overboard.
</i>

657
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,510
<i>30 feet, 35 feet,</i>

658
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,520
Do you ever think that
you might be quite mad?

659
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,850
Oh, yes!

660
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,290
The one man in the world
who never believes he's mad

661
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,540
Is the madman.

662
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,640
<i>
</i>

663
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,580
<i>So we got married a year
and a half after we joined</i>

664
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,180
<i>And moved to california.
I wanted to be a writer,</i>

665
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,580
<i>And my wife--
she was studying scientology.</i>

666
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,120
<i>We had a baby right away,
and the only people</i>

667
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,220
<i>We knew there
were scientologists.</i>

668
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,860
I was working
as a furniture mover
during the day

669
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,560
And writing spec scripts
at night.

670
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,230
<i>Then on the weekends, i'd be,
you know, doing some auditing.</i>

671
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,030
<i>Can you recall a time
when you were happy?</i>

672
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,400
<i> There was
a social aspect to it too.</i>

673
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,870
<i>You got to hang out
with people.</i>

674
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,900
<i>And there were some
interesting people,
nice people.</i>

675
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,920
These are all people
who are looking to improve
their life.

676
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,870
<i>While hubbard was hiding
from public view,</i>

677
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,930
<i>He was very active
in directing the operations
of the church,</i>

678
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,070
<i>Particularly
in hollywood.</i>

679
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,570
This was just after
the haight-ashbury era.

680
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,240
<i>And what scientology
was selling itself is,</i>

681
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,710
<i>"get high
without drugs."</i>

682
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,960
<i>It was a place
where people went
and explored ideas,</i>

683
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,800
<i>And you would often see
famous people--</i>

684
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,090
<i>Leonard cohen,
members of the grateful dead,</i>

685
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,840
<i>Rock hudson.</i>

686
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,510
<i>So they built
the celebrity centre.</i>

687
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,130
<i>The idea was to draw in
these famous entertainers</i>

688
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,230
<i>And use them as pitchmen
for the religion.</i>

689
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,070
In an industry
like hollywood,

690
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,770
Where stardom is such--
such an illusive quality,

691
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:02,840
<i>Scientology would offer
a route to maybe feel
a little bit more secure.</i>

692
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,950
<i>And when you're
trying to break in,
you're also dealing with</i>

693
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,660
Relentless rejection.

694
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,580
And something
that helps you stay focused

695
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,170
And feel that
you're improving yourself

696
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,710
And becoming more clear,
you can see the appeal of that.

697
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,540
The beliefs and practices
that i have studied
in scientology

698
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,380
Have been invaluable to me.

699
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,460
Have you ever met
ron hubbard?

700
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,300
I'd love to.
I'd be honored, because
i think he's so brilliant.

701
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,310
<i> So when i worked
at the celebrity centre,</i>

702
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,640
I would just, you know,
recruit various people.

703
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,780
<i>Like priscilla presley
and of course john travolta.</i>

704
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,900
<i>Johnny-- he came,
he started on course,</i>

705
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,490
And he was so fun
and outrageous.

706
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,760
<i>And he just made a party
wherever he was.</i>

707
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,040
<i>John travolta
was a young actor</i>

708
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,360
<i>In his very first movie.</i>

709
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,720
<i>He was a troubled young man,</i>

710
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,220
<i>And he was looking
for help.</i>

711
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,250
<i>A fellow actor gave him
a little bit of scientology
counseling.</i>

712
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,060
<i>She gave him a copy
of "dianetics,"</i>

713
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,340
And he was transported
by this.

714
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,710
He would go out
on his auditions,

715
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,210
And no matter
what he went out for,

716
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,060
<i>He would get it.</i>

717
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,400
<i>A band-aid commercial,
right away he booked that.</i>

718
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,900
<i>Now the army starts you...</i>

719
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,440
<i>He was booking everything,</i>

720
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,740
<i>And then he went up
for a series.</i>

721
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,240
Of course, he books it.

722
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,780
And it's a big series--
"welcome back, kotter."

723
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,580
Up your nose
with a rubber hose!

724
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,580
<i>In the late '70s
and early '80s,</i>

725
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,270
<i>John travolta
was scientology's
biggest star.</i>

726
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,170
<i>Spanky was assigned to be
travolta's key contact
with the church,</i>

727
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,810
<i>And she helped out
with producers, fans,
and the press.</i>

728
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,950
<i>They became close,
and when spanky got married,</i>

729
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,680
<i>Travolta was there.</i>

730
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,620
<i>When johnny first
got into scientology,</i>

731
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,770
He didn't even believe in
himself that much.

732
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,360
<i>But he got injected
with a lot of confidence,</i>

733
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,770
<i>And then you get
this phobia inducement</i>

734
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,890
<i>That "if i leave,
it's all going to go
down the tubes."</i>

735
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,980
When you're in
the organization,

736
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,200
All the good
that happens to you

737
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,930
Is because of scientology,

738
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,990
And everything that doesn't,
that isn't good, is your fault.

739
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,770
<i> They sell it all
in the beginning as something
quite logical.</i>

740
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,410
<i>Everything makes sense.</i>

741
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,880
And you're going up
what they call the bridge,

742
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,000
You're dong this auditing,
and this is good.

743
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,220
And the next one,
well, it's not quite as good.

744
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,090
It didn't quite make sense
to you, but...

745
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,920
You know, you've already
paid for the next one,
so you'll do that one.

746
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,790
<i>The bridge--
it's a metaphor.</i>

747
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,300
You start here
at the bottom of the bridge

748
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,150
And then you go to the top,
so where it is--

749
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,320
It's an awareness scale.

750
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:45,600
<i>You start down here
and you're not aware
of anything,</i>

751
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,160
<i>Then you go up here
and you're a lot more aware</i>

752
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,830
<i>Of who you are,</i>

753
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:55,280
Your spirituality,
your relationship to others.

754
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,450
<i>A person is supposed to
become more able</i>

755
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,200
<i>As they go up the bridge.</i>

756
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,320
<i>And then there are
the ot levels--</i>

757
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,010
<i>Operating thetan.</i>

758
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,160
<i>And a thetan
is a spiritual being.</i>

759
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,660
<i>That's the soul
of the person.</i>

760
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,300
<i>And what level, over time,
did you achieve?</i>

761
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,000
Ot eight.
That's the highest there is.

762
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,520
You can't get any higher
than ot eight.

763
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,360
From the beginning,
you hear these stories

764
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,190
People tell of these abilities
they've been able to gain.

765
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,850
It was always talked about,
the people who were ot
could read your mind,

766
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,450
And they could
move objects at will,

767
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,490
And they could--
they were cause over matter,
energy, space, and time,

768
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,370
So it sounded
damn good to me.

769
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,860
I mean, i thought,
"wow, this is great."

770
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,080
<i>I finally get to ot three,</i>

771
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,050
<i>And they give me
the secret materials,</i>

772
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,750
<i>Which i've been hearing about
all this time.</i>

773
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
<i>They're handwritten
by hubbard.</i>

774
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,390
<i>You have to keep them
in a locked briefcase,</i>

775
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,470
<i>Be very cautious,
because they always said,</i>

776
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,510
<i>"if this gets out,
it's dangerous to people.</i>

777
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,680
<i>"it could actually
do them harm if they
are not adequately prepared."</i>

778
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,380
And i read it.

779
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,680
And...

780
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,900
It doesn't make any sense.

781
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,860
This gobbled story
that didn't make sense.

782
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,940
I remember for
one fleeting second thinking,
"maybe it's an insanity test.

783
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,750
"maybe if you believe this,
they kick you out.

784
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,000
"you know, maybe that's it."
that, of course,
is not the case.

785
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,340
They talk about, you know,
the fact that the earth
was created

786
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,700
In such-and-such trillions
of years ago,

787
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,960
And this guy--
space guy--

788
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,760
Galactic overlord--
this was a prison planet,

789
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,510
And people being
caught, captured,

790
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,220
And being brought
to planet earth...

791
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,640
And put them in volcanoes
and blowing them up
with a-bombs.

792
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,440
Whoa!

793
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,920
I studied geography
in school.

794
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,260
Those volcanoes didn't exist
75 million years ago.

795
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,430
And we have these lost souls
all over us

796
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,600
And we have
to get rid of them,
and i'm going,

797
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,490
"what... The fuck
are you talking about?

798
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,120
"i mean, i'm down
for the self-help stuff.

799
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,660
"i'm down for--
okay, i can be clear.

800
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,210
"i can get rid of
the negative emotions.

801
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,440
"but what the fuck is this?"

802
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,550
<i> When you get
to the upper levels
of scientology,</i>

803
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,640
The creation myth
is explained to you.

804
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,170
<i>The story is that
75 million years ago,</i>

805
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,790
<i>People lived in a world
very much like the world</i>

806
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:22,430
<i>Of america
in the 1950s.</i>

807
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,650
<i>People, at that particular
time and space,</i>

808
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,100
<i>Were walking around
in clothes which looked</i>

809
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,850
<i>Very remarkably like
the clothes they wear
in this very minute.</i>

810
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,470
<i>And the cars they drove
looked exactly the same,</i>

811
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:38,030
<i>And they walked down streets
that looked like these streets.</i>

812
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,450
<i>It was a very similar world</i>

813
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,780
<i>And similar problems,</i>

814
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,120
<i>One of which
was overpopulation.</i>

815
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,870
<i>They had elected a fellow</i>

816
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,820
<i>By the name of xenu
to the supreme ruler.</i>

817
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,920
<i>There was a tyrannical overlord</i>

818
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,660
<i>Of the galactic confederacy
named xenu.</i>

819
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,380
<i>In order
to resolve this problem
of overpopulation,</i>

820
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,850
<i>He called people in,</i>

821
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,350
<i>Ostensibly for tax audits,</i>

822
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,640
<i>And had them frozen
with injections</i>

823
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,670
<i>Of glycol to their heart.</i>

824
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,310
<i>Boxed them up in boxes,
threw 'em into space planes--</i>

825
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,230
<i>Dc-8 airplane
is the exact copy</i>

826
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,230
<i>Of the space plane
of that day.</i>

827
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,320
<i>They were flown to
the prison planet, teegeeack--</i>

828
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,820
<i>It's actually
the planet earth--</i>

829
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:25,740
<i>And these frozen bodies
were then dropped
into volcanoes.</i>

830
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,960
<i>And then they set off
hydrogen bombs</i>

831
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
<i>On the top of each volcano.</i>

832
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,300
<i> And their
disembodied spirits--</i>

833
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,130
<i>These are called thetans--</i>

834
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,090
<i>Floated out,
and they were captured</i>

835
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,260
<i>And forced to sit
in front of movie screens.</i>

836
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:43,840
<i>With a 3d, super colossal,
motion picture.</i>

837
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,890
They were shown images--

838
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,180
<i>Implants,
as hubbard would have it.</i>

839
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,900
<i>Every man is shown crucified,</i>

840
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,570
<i>So is the psychiatrist
shown crucified.</i>

841
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,320
<i>And that's how he gets away
with what he gets away with.</i>

842
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,520
<i>He electric-shocks people.</i>

843
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,390
<i>And when a child is born,</i>

844
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:03,780
<i>A thetan will leap inside
the child's body</i>

845
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,230
<i>At that very instant,
and it becomes like
the child's soul.</i>

846
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,590
<i>More than one thetan
might crowd into the body--</i>

847
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,410
<i>Hundreds,
or thousands, might.</i>

848
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,460
They're the source
of all of our neurosis,

849
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,010
Fears, and anxieties.

850
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,080
<i>Then you are
on the e-meter,</i>

851
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,460
<i>By yourself, now.</i>

852
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,930
<i>You're soloing.</i>

853
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,350
<i>You're supposed
to scan, mentally,</i>

854
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,770
<i>From your top of your head
to your toes,</i>

855
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:33,860
To see if you can locate
any alien beings.

856
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,260
And when you do,
you tell them to go away.

857
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,930
<i>I kept on trying to audit.</i>

858
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,290
<i>I could not figure out
how i could have</i>

859
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,540
All these spirits
of dead people
attached to me,

860
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,380
Inside me, on me.

861
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,440
I was clear.

862
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,000
For god's sake,
i was clear.

863
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,170
People actually
have breakdowns,

864
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,630
You know,
nervous breakdowns,

865
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,170
Because they spend
so much time thinking

866
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,220
<i>About being infested
by these creatures.</i>

867
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,430
<i>If you're
really believing that,
it can drive you crazy.</i>

868
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,770
<i></i>

869
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,490
<i>Those years of introspection</i>

870
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:26,280
Eventually led me
to sincerely considering

871
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:30,080
That i was so bad,

872
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,620
That i couldn't confront
how bad i was.

873
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,210
I didn't know it
at the time,

874
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,460
But a depression set in
that was with me for years,

875
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,510
<i>And the worst thing was</i>

876
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:47,720
<i>That lrh kept ordering me
to more auditing.</i>

877
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:51,300
<i>I had to find swords
that were stuck in me--</i>

878
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,440
Hypothetical swords,

879
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,680
Imaginary swords that
were causing all this pain.

880
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,610
<i>This auditing
went on and on.</i>

881
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,400
<i>It wasn't doing any good.</i>

882
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,850
<i>I should have been
left alone.</i>

883
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:07,200
<i>But everything
that i took offense with,</i>

884
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,960
<i>I rationalized
almost immediately.</i>

885
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,760
<i>I had to.</i>

886
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,660
I could not continue
in this game of scientology

887
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,750
Without explaining away
what he was doing.

888
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,300
<i>It got to be
a way of believing,</i>

889
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,560
<i>And every one of us
got into that.</i>

890
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,560
<i>It was part
of the mind control.</i>

891
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,270
<i>It was part of
the cultic manipulation.</i>

892
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,600
<i>He was the master
who did it to us,</i>

893
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:43,820
<i>And we took it on
and then we did it
to ourselves.</i>

894
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,490
<i>And i learned from it,</i>

895
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,700
That i would
never ever again,

896
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,360
You know, go--
do the bidding of a tyrant.

897
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:02,540
<i></i>

898
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,940
<i>Hubbard questioned
his own sanity</i>

899
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,050
<i>And actually wrote a letter
to the veteran's administration</i>

900
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,920
<i>Asking for psychiatric help</i>

901
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,350
<i>That he seems
never to have been given.</i>

902
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:18,440
I think
that his whole creation
of scientology

903
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,760
Really was a form
of self-therapy.

904
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,950
<i>If he were just a fraud,
then at some point,</i>

905
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,900
<i>He would have
taken the money and run,</i>

906
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,320
<i>But he never did that.</i>

907
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:30,120
<i>He spent much of his day
on the e-meter,</i>

908
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,270
<i>Trying to understand
what was going on</i>

909
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,110
<i>Inside his own mind.</i>

910
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,740
<i>Hubbard became
increasingly paranoid</i>

911
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,280
<i>That a powerful thetan
had infected his body</i>

912
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,250
<i>And that regular auditing</i>

913
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,000
<i>Wasn't strong enough
to make it leave.</i>

914
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,750
<i>When larry wright
was researching his book,</i>

915
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:49,420
<i>He videotaped an interview
with a scientologist</i>

916
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,810
<i>Who was asked
to help hubbard
expel the thetan.</i>

917
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,260
He was having,
uh, problems

918
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,350
Getting rid of a bt--
body thetan--

919
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,070
<i>So he wanted me
to build a machine,</i>

920
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,600
<i>And basically
blow the thetan away,</i>

921
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,020
<i>Just get him out of there.</i>

922
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,660
Blow him out.
And also kill the body.

923
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,980
Basically, yeah.
Yeah.

924
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,150
<i>But i didn't
want to kill him.</i>

925
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,050
<i>I just wanted
to scare him.</i>

926
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:21,170
So i had read some books
about nikola tesla and stuff,

927
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,510
<i>And i figured maybe
buildin' a tesla coil</i>

928
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,260
<i>Would probably be
the best route to go.</i>

929
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,630
<i>I had little electrodes</i>

930
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,550
<i>That you hook it up
to the e-meter,</i>

931
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,660
<i>So when he's on the cans,</i>

932
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,800
<i>Then, uh, he would
just flip the button,</i>

933
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,000
<i>And it would do its thing.</i>

934
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,680
As far as i know.
He blew up my e-meter.

935
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:45,360
Burned it up.

936
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,700
Scientology
really is a journey

937
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,150
Into the mind
of l. Ron hubbard.

938
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,370
<i>And the further
you get into it,</i>

939
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:59,710
<i>The more like
l. Ron hubbard
you become.</i>

940
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,340
Thank you.

941
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:15,140
In 1980,
lrh moved off the lines

942
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,310
So that he could
continue his writings

943
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:21,510
And researches
without any distractions.

944
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:29,100
He has now moved on
to his next ot--

945
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,660
Level of ot research.

946
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:35,060
This level is beyond anything
any one of us ever imagined.

947
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,860
This level is in fact done

948
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,730
In an exterior state,

949
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,170
Meaning that it is done
completely exterior

950
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,170
From the body.

951
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:48,070
At this level of ot,

952
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:49,540
The body is nothing more

953
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,240
Than an impediment
and encumbrance

954
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,130
To any further gain
as an ot.

955
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,050
Thus...

956
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,420
Thus, at 2000 hours,

957
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,690
Friday,
the 24th of january,

958
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:08,440
A.D. 36,

959
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,480
L. Ron hubbard
discarded the body

960
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:12,650
He had used
in this lifetime

961
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,790
For 74 years,
10 months, and 11 days.

962
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,070
Although you may feel grief,

963
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:22,910
Understand that he did not,
and does not now.

964
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,450
<i>Hubbard died
of a stroke in 1986,</i>

965
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,380
<i>But he left no plan
for succession.</i>

966
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,140
<i>The ambitious david miscavige
stepped forward,</i>

967
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,960
<i>And by bending arms
and making deals,</i>

968
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,620
<i>Took control of the church</i>

969
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,560
<i>And installed
a new generation
of lieutenants.</i>

970
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,260
We want to make sure

971
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,770
That all of us end cycle
on this completely,

972
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,940
So we can get on
with the job

973
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,800
That is ahead of us.

974
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,530
<i>The first time i met
miscavige was in '83.</i>

975
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,360
He was a guy
running back and forth

976
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,830
Between hubbard
and the property
in hemet in a van--

977
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:05,200
Back and forth,
delivering messages.

978
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,840
<i>Worked my way
through the organization.</i>

979
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,370
<i>Miscavige would
come down to florida,</i>

980
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,170
<i>Where i was
running the place,</i>

981
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:15,290
<i>And we slowly
but surely became friends.</i>

982
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:18,530
By 2001,
i was working directly
for miscavige.

983
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,600
<i>We'd sit and drink
a bottle of scotch,</i>

984
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,870
<i>And i'd hear
everything he had to say
about the church,</i>

985
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,570
<i>And about the people involved,
from his perspective.</i>

986
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,860
And honestly, it was--
it was, uh, horrifying.
It was scary.

987
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,510
<i>In scientology,
there was a concept</i>

988
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:35,680
<i>That 98% of the people
are good and 2% are evil.</i>

989
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,320
<i>Well, he worked very hard
to convince me</i>

990
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,950
That it was
the other way around.

991
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:43,240
2.5% were okay
and the rest were
very evil and bad.

992
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:46,540
And somehow,
they'd all been dumped
on that base

993
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,210
So they could be around him.

994
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,410
He was--
he was extremely paranoid.

995
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,220
So, marty, is miscavige
a true believer?

996
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:59,000
Uh, yes.

997
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,310
<i>He has to
continue to believe,</i>

998
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,110
<i>Because if he looks
at it rationally</i>

999
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,580
<i>And he sees that it
is as i say,</i>

1000
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,350
<i>It will destroy him.</i>

1001
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,560
You know,
he'll just realize that--

1002
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,100
Because he's done
a lot worse than i've done.

1003
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,990
He's abused people
on a personal level,

1004
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,910
Um, as a-- as a--
that's how he got to the top,

1005
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:22,940
And that's how
he stayed at the top.

1006
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,360
<i>At the age of 11,</i>

1007
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,620
<i>David miscavige
joined the church
with his parents.</i>

1008
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,620
<i>As a child, his ambition
caught hubbard's eye.</i>

1009
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,870
<i>So when hubbard wanted
to become a filmmaker,</i>

1010
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:36,710
<i>Miscavige was
his assistant cameraman.</i>

1011
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,340
<i>An auditing prodigy,</i>

1012
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,810
<i>He claimed scientology
cured his asthma.</i>

1013
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:44,600
<i>He became a sort of
general contractor
for the church,</i>

1014
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,770
<i>And was soon named
action chief--</i>

1015
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,470
<i>The man who did
whatever needed doing
for a church</i>

1016
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,920
<i>That developed
a scary reputation</i>

1017
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,730
<i>For attacking its critics.</i>

1018
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,440
<i>Scientology has been
in the headlines</i>

1019
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,950
<i>Off and on
for 25 years now,</i>

1020
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,760
<i>Almost since the time
it was founded as a religion.</i>

1021
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,980
<i>Scientology's story
is one of a church</i>

1022
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,870
<i>Embittered by what
it perceives as harassment.</i>

1023
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,200
<i>We're talking about attacks</i>

1024
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,110
From multi-billion dollar
media conglomerates,

1025
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:11,630
<i>World governments--
real powers of the world.</i>

1026
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,330
They take enemies
very seriously.

1027
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,050
This comes right out
of hubbard's own policies

1028
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,120
From the '60s,
saying, "we never defend,
we always attack."

1029
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,140
<i>And they have followed it
ever since.</i>

1030
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,450
<i>They call it "fair game,"</i>

1031
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,590
<i>And anybody who criticizes
scientology is fair game.</i>

1032
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,140
Whatever you're told,

1033
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,060
Whatever needs to be done,

1034
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,600
If it's against the law,
it doesn't matter.

1035
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,980
<i>The best example is,
in the mid '70s,</i>

1036
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,770
<i>Scientologists were
walking in to these
department of justice offices</i>

1037
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,610
And irs offices
and taking documents
out by the yard.

1038
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,860
<i>The fbi raided
the church of scientology--</i>

1039
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,080
<i>The largest raid
in fbi history
at that time.</i>

1040
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,580
Oh my god.
The building
is filled with fbi,

1041
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,370
And they're--
they're taking things.

1042
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,150
<i>It was craziness.</i>

1043
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:55,590
<i>Clearly, l. Ron hubbard
was in charge of all of that,</i>

1044
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,690
But he was only named
an unindicted co-conspirator.

1045
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,620
<i>And mary sue hubbard,
hubbard's wife,</i>

1046
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,880
<i>She went to prison,
10 others went to prison.</i>

1047
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,430
This was where
i cut my teeth.
I was in my early 20s,

1048
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:07,130
<i>Miscavige
was in his early 20s.</i>

1049
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:08,880
<i>We were taking over
for this group</i>

1050
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,720
That had created
the largest domestic
espionage operation

1051
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:13,360
In the history
of the united states.

1052
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,860
They were
breaking into offices,

1053
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:17,640
Framing people.
This is the activities
of a church?

1054
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,140
There was a guy who,
uh, you know,

1055
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,200
Was a reporter
for "the la times,"

1056
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:22,530
Whose dog was poisoned

1057
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,780
While he was working
on a scientology story.

1058
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:27,040
<i>Again and again
while reporting the story,</i>

1059
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,960
<i>We met many former members
who describe scientology</i>

1060
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:33,360
<i>As a dangerous and deeply
paranoid organization.</i>

1061
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,130
They hired private detectives
to harass people.

1062
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,550
I have been sued twice.

1063
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,800
Financial ruin.

1064
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,000
Years of harassment.

1065
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,870
Their homes broken into,
have them beaten.

1066
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:45,000
We chased her around.
We followed her
to the airport.

1067
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,390
Gotten ahold of
personal phone records.

1068
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,810
Slashed their tires,
break their car windows.

1069
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,180
I was locked
in a chicken wire cage.

1070
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,680
Dangerous, horrifying,
terrifying fraud.

1071
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,520
A nightmare.

1072
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,480
Many of their stories
are corroborated

1073
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,850
In sworn court testimony
by up to a dozen other people.

1074
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,570
Are they all lying?

1075
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,770
They sat in a room,

1076
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:07,230
They figured out
what they were going to say...

1077
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,080
<i>My position,
as the spokesperson,</i>

1078
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:13,530
Was to evade
the question,

1079
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,620
Or sleaze around some way,

1080
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,620
Or give what
was an acceptable answer,

1081
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:19,750
Or something
that i believed at the time.

1082
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,710
Please welcome
mr. Mike rinder.

1083
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,100
<i>Because scientology
is perceived</i>

1084
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,850
And conceived
by scientologists

1085
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:37,220
As being the salvation
for mankind,

1086
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,060
You can have people
that lie

1087
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:42,930
With a very straight face

1088
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:45,480
If they believe
that what they are doing

1089
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:48,270
Is protecting
the church of scientology.

1090
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,530
L. Ron hubbard says,

1091
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,770
"we do not find critics
of scientology

1092
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,200
"who do not
have criminal pasts."

1093
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,460
Do you believe that?
Sure.

1094
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:58,040
People who oppose you
are undoubtedly criminals?

1095
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,490
I believe that, yeah.

1096
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:02,050
You know, there isn't
and hasn't been

1097
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,750
Any effort
which has been taken to,

1098
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,630
Quote,
"silence critics."

1099
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,640
"no, that doesn't happen.

1100
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:11,170
"oh, we would never do that."

1101
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,170
But according
to many insiders,

1102
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,090
Hubbard was growing
more and more vindictive

1103
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,590
Toward those
who stood in his way.

1104
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:21,520
<i>He created what he called
the rehabilitation
project force.</i>

1105
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:24,270
<i>The rpf was
what we called it.</i>

1106
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,600
It was the prison camp,

1107
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,190
Where you'd go
for re-indoctrination.

1108
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,110
<i>It was on the 7th floor</i>

1109
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,160
<i>Of the hollywood
headquarters,</i>

1110
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,330
<i>A confined space
to rehabilitate members</i>

1111
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:37,820
<i>Who might be harboring
subversive thoughts.</i>

1112
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,000
<i>Spanky was sent to the rpf</i>

1113
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,870
<i>When she objected
to the way the church</i>

1114
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,290
<i>Had denied medical treatment
to her boss.</i>

1115
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,710
<i>I went thinking, of course,</i>

1116
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,340
<i>This is a big mistake.</i>

1117
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,930
And then i got there,
and there were like
200 of us.

1118
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,880
<i>So much of the exec strata
of the organization there</i>

1119
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,880
<i>Hit the skids
simultaneously.</i>

1120
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:59,640
<i>Rpf stands for
rehabilitation project force.</i>

1121
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,970
It is a program
that is exclusively

1122
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,690
For the benefit
of sea organization members.

1123
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,200
If they are stressed out,

1124
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:10,010
If they're not doing well
on their job,

1125
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,280
<i>Have them do
menial-type work,</i>

1126
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,070
<i>And five hours a day
of auditing</i>

1127
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,460
<i>And scientology training.</i>

1128
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,080
It's a fabulous program.

1129
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,550
We were working--
cross my heart--

1130
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,830
30 hours on,
three hours off.

1131
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,200
Doing, like, hard labor,

1132
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,370
Like having wire brushes
on windowsills,

1133
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,140
And sanding
and sanding and sanding.

1134
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,500
Breathing paint fumes.

1135
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,710
<i>The regular crew
would eat first,</i>

1136
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,510
<i>And then we'd get
what was left.</i>

1137
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,390
<i>It was kinda
like table scraps.</i>

1138
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:41,210
<i>There was mattresses
out there on the roof,</i>

1139
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,710
<i>And they were wet
and soggy and gross.</i>

1140
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,650
<i>And if you got to sleep
for three hours,</i>

1141
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:49,150
<i>Sometimes you'd just have to
up there and crash out.</i>

1142
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,090
<i>And i had a young child
at that time,</i>

1143
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,460
<i>Who was 10 months old
when i went to the rpf.</i>

1144
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,360
<i>She got taken
and put in the cadet org,</i>

1145
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,170
<i>The organization
for the children.</i>

1146
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,950
And then i--
i got pregnant

1147
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,920
<i>When i was in the rpf.</i>

1148
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,240
<i>So now i'm sanding walls,
eating table scraps,</i>

1149
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:13,680
<i>Pregnant,
and worrying myself sick
about my child.</i>

1150
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,010
<i>In spanky's time,
the children</i>

1151
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,020
<i>Of sea org members
were separated</i>

1152
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,100
<i>From their parents
and raised in the cadet org</i>

1153
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,970
<i>To remove all distractions</i>

1154
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,520
<i>From their parent's
ultimate responsibility,</i>

1155
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,520
<i>To clear the planet.</i>

1156
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,140
<i>Sea org members
were often pressured
to have abortions,</i>

1157
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,430
<i>Because the church
viewed "getting children"</i>

1158
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,930
<i>As an unpractical burden.</i>

1159
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:37,120
<i>Initially, you're like,
"this is absurd.</i>

1160
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:38,290
<i>"this is nuts."</i>

1161
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,070
And then you kinda
settle in and go, "well...

1162
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:46,610
"obviously, i need
to deal with something

1163
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,280
"that i'm not facing.

1164
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,000
"so perhaps this is--

1165
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:52,080
"they're doing this
to make me better."

1166
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,670
<i>There are so many
bizarre stories that you--</i>

1167
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:00,930
<i>Just hard
to believe stuff.</i>

1168
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,960
They asked
if i could arrange
a private screening

1169
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,350
Of "saturday night fever."

1170
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,070
<i>And i was like, "what?"</i>

1171
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,800
<i>"i had disappeared
from this man's life.</i>

1172
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,520
<i>"i abandoned him,</i>

1173
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,970
"and now you
want me to arrange
a private screening?

1174
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,360
"what are you--"

1175
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:18,140
I said,
"is there anything else?
Maybe a beatles reunion?"

1176
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:23,110
<i>Travolta had been wondering
where spanky was.</i>

1177
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,500
<i>When she was sent
to the rpf,</i>

1178
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:27,700
<i>She was not allowed
to contact him
or anyone else.</i>

1179
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,820
<i>But now,
under the watch of a guard,</i>

1180
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,820
<i>She was permitted
to call travolta's assistant.</i>

1181
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,160
She said we could
use john's personal print
of the film,

1182
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,930
<i>Under one condition--
that you will see john.</i>

1183
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:40,880
<i>I was so excited.</i>

1184
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:44,670
<i>I hadn't had dialogue
with him for many months.</i>

1185
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,060
<i>We had the screening
of the film,</i>

1186
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,520
<i>And on the next night,</i>

1187
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,310
<i>I was supposed
to have dinner with johnny.</i>

1188
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,010
And after
the screening,

1189
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,900
I was abruptly told
i wasn't going to see him,

1190
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,820
And i needed
to call and cancel.

1191
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:02,690
He was truly angry
at me for-- for--

1192
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:05,790
For having allowed this abuse
of myself, you know,

1193
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:09,460
And for having that--
so little of myself...

1194
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,220
That i would allow
this degree of degradation,

1195
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:17,370
And, and um--
and--

1196
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,170
And he was my good friend,

1197
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:22,590
And i knew that he was
telling me the truth.

1198
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,010
<i>Those words were
such a wakeup call for me.</i>

1199
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:30,210
<i>And i went over there,
to the cadet org.</i>

1200
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:31,930
There were so many
sick children in there,

1201
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,150
And my daughter
was very, very ill--

1202
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:38,190
Burning up with fever,
completely neglected,

1203
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,740
In a urine-soaked crib.

1204
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,560
Her eyes were
so filled with mucus,

1205
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,910
They were welded shut.

1206
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:48,450
She had fruit flies
on her body.

1207
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,900
And i just--
i couldn't bear it.

1208
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,510
I just went,
"no, mmm-mmm, i'm done."

1209
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,240
I mean, i just knew
i could make these choices
for me.

1210
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,210
I could decide
to give up my life

1211
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,180
And do this
to help the world,

1212
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,470
But i couldn't
make these choices
for my children.

1213
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,630
I just had to get her out.

1214
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,690
<i>I told them
that i was having problems
with my pregnancy,</i>

1215
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,730
<i>And i needed
to use the phone,</i>

1216
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,560
<i>So they sent
a bodyguard with me.</i>

1217
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,480
<i>I called one of the few
non-scientologists i knew,</i>

1218
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,280
A wonderful woman who happened
to work for john travolta.

1219
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,870
<i>I said,
"meet me at this address."</i>

1220
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,700
<i>I gave her a time
and i hung up.</i>

1221
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,710
<i>I go up to my daughter's room,
and i wrapped her up.</i>

1222
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,750
And there's
that bodyguard with me.

1223
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,880
<i>I said,
"oh, my sister-in-law
is in that car</i>

1224
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,280
<i>"and she's gonna
take the baby to the doctor."</i>

1225
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,720
He said, "well,
has this been approved?"

1226
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,300
"of course
it was approved!"

1227
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,810
<i>She's in my arms,
and i got in the car.</i>

1228
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,510
<i>My friend,
she just nods her head.</i>

1229
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,350
<i>Boom! With that,
i pull my leg in,
shut that door.</i>

1230
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,650
<i>She hits the locks,
and we drive.</i>

1231
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,270
<i>And people
are yelling my name,</i>

1232
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,320
<i>Saying, "spanky, no! No!"</i>

1233
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:00,410
<i>I mean, just freaked out.</i>

1234
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,320
<i>I'm thinkin'
"i'm a dead person,</i>

1235
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,780
<i>"something terrible
is gonna happen to me."</i>

1236
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,660
<i>I was just so frightened</i>

1237
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,860
<i>That they would come
to fetch me up.</i>

1238
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,120
<i>One of the turning points</i>

1239
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,520
<i>In travolta's relationship
with the church</i>

1240
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,180
Is when he understood
what was happening to spanky,

1241
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:24,660
He didn't
do anything about it.

1242
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,430
I know that
he certainly got exposed

1243
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:30,440
To the fact
that not everything
was on the up and up.

1244
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:33,100
Why that wasn't sufficient
for him to leave,

1245
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,220
I don't know.

1246
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:40,180
I often wonder what--
what could possibly
keep him there?

1247
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,450
<i>Can you recall an incident</i>

1248
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,710
<i>Which occurred
when your mother
looked younger?</i>

1249
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:48,400
<i>An auditor learns to
keep notes contemporaneously</i>

1250
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,790
<i>As he is doing a session,</i>

1251
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:54,210
<i>About every detail
of the person's life,</i>

1252
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,130
<i>Back to birth and beyond.</i>

1253
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,630
<i>If you do the whole program,</i>

1254
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:01,200
<i>You end up with
up to a file cabinet full</i>

1255
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:05,140
<i>Of pre-clear folders
on notations about your life,</i>

1256
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:08,170
<i>Your thoughts,
and your considerations
about your life.</i>

1257
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,590
It's the most
intimate detail.

1258
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,390
<i>You're always encouraged,
you're always threatened,</i>

1259
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:18,350
<i>To disclose more
and more and more.
And all of it's recorded.</i>

1260
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,820
<i>All of this material,</i>

1261
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:22,400
<i>Which is represented to you
to be held sacrosanct--</i>

1262
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,990
<i>In fact, any information</i>

1263
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,740
<i>That might do some harm
to the organization,</i>

1264
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,230
Gets unclassified
automatically

1265
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,830
And gets reported
to another branch
of the church

1266
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:35,030
That deals with "ethics."

1267
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,910
<i>Travolta was down
in clearwater.</i>

1268
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:45,260
<i>We'd finished
the renovations.</i>

1269
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,600
<i>Every auditing room
had two cameras--</i>

1270
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:50,920
<i>One on the meter,
and one on the guy
getting auditing.</i>

1271
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,100
<i>Miscavige would sit
in this 15x15 room,</i>

1272
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:56,100
<i>Cameras of every session.</i>

1273
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,590
<i>You can flip in between 'em,</i>

1274
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:59,560
And he was watching
these things.

1275
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:01,110
And it was
for "training purposes."

1276
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,590
Well, travolta saw that,

1277
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:05,530
And he said,
"i will not be videoed."

1278
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:08,530
So i was there when
they were setting it up,

1279
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,400
And miscavige
was directing it.

1280
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,240
"get him
into a hotel room,

1281
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,870
"hook up secret,
private videos."

1282
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,110
<i>There were rumors</i>

1283
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:21,130
<i>That he was
threatening to leave,</i>

1284
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,050
<i>And another scientologist
told me that he was delegated</i>

1285
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:28,500
To create a black pr package--
all the damaging material

1286
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,840
They could use
against travolta,

1287
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:33,140
Which came
from his auditing sessions.

1288
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,840
I know this
because i used to do it

1289
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:39,730
<i>When i was the head
of the office of
special affairs.</i>

1290
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,520
We would
put a team of people

1291
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:44,770
<i>Onto going through
all of these pc folders</i>

1292
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,520
<i>And finding things
that they believe.</i>

1293
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,610
<i>By exposing them
or threatening to expose them,</i>

1294
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,250
<i>They will cower the person</i>

1295
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,780
<i>That they're worried about
into silence.</i>

1296
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,620
<i>There is a particular writing</i>

1297
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:06,260
<i>Where hubbard
is training these office
of special affairs people</i>

1298
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:10,460
On how, when you use
private information

1299
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,850
To control somebody
to do what you want them
to do,

1300
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,630
And to silence them
from speaking out
against scientology,

1301
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:20,020
It's really not blackmail,
because you're not
asking for money.

1302
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:21,970
But you're holding
this secret information

1303
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:24,310
Over the person's head
to silence them.

1304
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,510
<i>As far as travolta
is concerned,</i>

1305
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:29,850
<i>People say, well, he--
there's all these things
that we know about</i>

1306
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:31,700
<i>That have been rumored
in the tabloids.</i>

1307
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:34,540
<i>But in fact,
it's more of
a two-way street.</i>

1308
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:36,290
You know, he's provided
with an auditor

1309
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,710
Whose shoulder
he can cry on,

1310
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:40,710
But he's also
provided with the muscle
of the church,

1311
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,290
<i>In the form of myself
and mike rinder.</i>

1312
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:44,500
<i>On many occasions,</i>

1313
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,630
<i>We were sent out
to get with his publicist,</i>

1314
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:47,830
<i>To get with his lawyer,</i>

1315
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:50,670
And to help squash
or intimidate these people

1316
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,970
That are making accusations
against him.

1317
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,470
Once that happened,

1318
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:57,640
I think he was really
the church's captive.

1319
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,430
Mr. John travolta!

1320
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:21,730
<i>When they were facing lawsuits
and stuff like that,</i>

1321
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,030
<i>He'd be brought forward,</i>

1322
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:25,870
<i>And make his testimony
about how great
scientology is.</i>

1323
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,540
<i>He had the opportunity</i>

1324
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:31,410
To affect
the behavior of the church,
and he chose not to.

1325
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,850
<i>Now i've been a scientologist
for 23 years.</i>

1326
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,220
I've felt like a pioneer
in many-- in many ways,

1327
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:41,770
And i've--
i've seen my efforts
come to fruition...

1328
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,750
In various ways.

1329
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:46,720
I think very few people
can say that.

1330
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,440
I've-- i'm part of a--
of a frontier in a way,

1331
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,760
You know, that,
that very few people
ever get to be part of.

1332
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:29,520
Thank you.

1333
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:32,100
Welcome to church!

1334
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:35,740
<i>It was the biggest event
in scientology history,</i>

1335
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:39,190
<i>And of course,
miscavige wanted to milk it
for everything he had.</i>

1336
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,200
<i>It's this
grand, produced thing,</i>

1337
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:45,670
<i>Where it's all
a single person
on a gigantic stage,</i>

1338
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,990
<i>All this sort of
nazi symbolism.</i>

1339
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,820
<i>I clearly recall
getting prepared
for the event</i>

1340
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,630
<i>And miscavige
up in that office,</i>

1341
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:57,290
<i>You know,
going 18-20 hours a day</i>

1342
01:05:57,330 --> 01:06:00,300
Writing this speech,
and thinking to myself,

1343
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:03,220
"my god, you know?
This is not just

1344
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:05,890
"a victory celebration,

1345
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,270
"this is a--
this is a coup."

1346
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:10,810
What we are going
to talk about

1347
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:14,650
Is the war
to end all wars.

1348
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,150
When you are in scientology,
you are in all the way.

1349
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,570
There's no half in
and half out.

1350
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:22,620
<i>A decade into
miscavige's leadership,</i>

1351
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,910
<i>A simmering crisis
finally came to a boil.</i>

1352
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,380
<i>For years hubbard had
insisted that scientology
was a religion</i>

1353
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:31,460
<i>And should be tax-exempt,</i>

1354
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:35,200
<i>So he had refused
to pay any taxes.</i>

1355
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,750
We were facing a tax bill

1356
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,340
Of over a billion dollars,
and the total assets,

1357
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:44,930
Liquid and material,
and property of the church

1358
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:48,010
Was about a quarter of that
at the time, in the '80s.

1359
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:52,320
And so just
from a real simple
accounting basis,

1360
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,680
It was life and death.

1361
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,270
If we don't
get exemption, we die.

1362
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,220
If we get it, we survive.

1363
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,110
As lrh said,

1364
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,780
"one certainly
couldn't contest anyone

1365
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:04,560
"as holy as the commissioner
of the irs,

1366
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:09,120
"whom i believe gives god
his orders." lrh.

1367
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:11,120
<i>Faced with this crisis,</i>

1368
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:13,900
<i>David miscavige
formulated a strategy.</i>

1369
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,960
<i>Think of the nerve
that it takes</i>

1370
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:19,760
To decide to take on a war
with the irs.

1371
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,630
The church of scientology

1372
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,080
Has been crucifying
the federal agency

1373
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,470
For its sins
on a regular basis,

1374
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,550
Both in and out of courts.

1375
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,220
<i>Thousands of scientologists
all filed lawsuits,</i>

1376
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,420
<i>Not just against the irs,</i>

1377
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,310
<i>But against
individual irs employees.</i>

1378
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,260
<i>2400 total lawsuits,</i>

1379
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,150
<i>All going at the irs
at one time.</i>

1380
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,900
It was
a litigation nightmare.

1381
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:45,620
<i>Being miscavige's
right-hand man,</i>

1382
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,570
<i>I was in charge
of all those efforts.</i>

1383
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:50,820
<i>We were not only
suing them in every possible
jurisdiction there was,</i>

1384
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,740
We were investigating
the irs for crimes generally,

1385
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,330
Or things that would
offend the public.

1386
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:57,380
...These hearings
into irs integrity...

1387
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,720
<i>In the late '80s,</i>

1388
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,470
<i>There were hearings
about irs abuses</i>

1389
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,750
<i>That had nothing to do
with scientology,</i>

1390
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:02,920
<i>Had nothing to do
with nonprofits,</i>

1391
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,340
<i>Had nothing
to do with churches.</i>

1392
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,470
<i>They had to do
with joe taxpayer.</i>

1393
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:09,460
<i>And they we were publishing
these glossy,</i>

1394
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,900
<i>Expensive magazines.</i>

1395
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:13,980
<i>In fact, the exposÃƒÂ©s
of irs crimes</i>

1396
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,900
Were so hated
that possession
of "freedom" magazine

1397
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,850
Was banned by irs officials
in the irs building.

1398
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:26,910
There is going to be
a irs conference
in the catskills.

1399
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:30,030
Right?
And so we would send a pi,

1400
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,080
<i>Find out which hotel
it's gonna be at,</i>

1401
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,320
<i>Get down there
during happy hour,
socialize.</i>

1402
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:38,510
<i>And this guy's tallying
who's drinkin' what.</i>

1403
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,420
And so we go through
freedom of information act

1404
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:43,710
To find out
that the taxpayers
are paying the bar bill,

1405
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,550
And it's so much money.

1406
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,800
And of course, you know,

1407
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:48,670
In the scheme of things,
it's nothing.

1408
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,550
But from a pr perspective,
it's everything.

1409
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:54,640
Irs officials told me
to my face

1410
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:57,110
They weren't interested
in hearing anything

1411
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:01,030
I had to say
because, and i quote,

1412
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:03,180
"you are a scientologist.

1413
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,400
"you are a mindless robot."

1414
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:10,200
Well, those who know me
can imagine my response.

1415
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:16,410
It was short,
but certainly made the point.

1416
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:22,130
<i>A negotiation
began to take place</i>

1417
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:26,420
<i>Between the irs
and the church
of scientology.</i>

1418
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:28,390
How do you define
a religion?

1419
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,010
It's not so easy.

1420
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:34,140
Why is one body
of thinking a religion

1421
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,650
<i>And another body not?</i>

1422
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:41,490
<i>The only organization
entitled to make
those distinctions</i>

1423
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,520
<i>Is the irs as an agency--</i>

1424
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,820
<i>Very poorly equipped
to do that.</i>

1425
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,610
<i>I mean, they're mainly
accountants and lawyers,</i>

1426
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:49,410
<i>They're not theologians.</i>

1427
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:52,080
<i>But it's the only opinion
that matters.</i>

1428
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:55,370
<i>Once the irs has decided
that you are a religion,</i>

1429
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:59,540
<i>Then you are protected
by the vast protections</i>

1430
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:02,210
<i>Of the first amendment.</i>

1431
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,090
<i>And, as the saying goes,</i>

1432
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,750
The rest is history.
On october the first, 1993,

1433
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,850
At 8:37 pm
eastern standard time,

1434
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:15,100
The irs issued letters
recognizing scientology

1435
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,220
And every one
of its organizations

1436
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:20,440
As fully tax-exempt!
The war is over!

1437
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:29,230
<i>The war ended</i>

1438
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:31,200
<i>Because the irs surrendered.</i>

1439
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,400
<i>It forgave
the billion-dollar tax bill</i>

1440
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,070
<i>And granted scientology
its tax exemption.</i>

1441
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:39,880
<i>Even hubbard's novels
were declared religious texts,</i>

1442
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:43,080
<i>Their sales
exempt from taxes.</i>

1443
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,500
What happened
is that fred goldberg,

1444
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:48,340
Who was the irs commissioner
at that time--

1445
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:51,220
<i>Miscavige let goldberg know
that if we could find a way</i>

1446
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,760
<i>To get tax-exempt status,</i>

1447
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,620
<i>All those lawsuits
will go away overnight.</i>

1448
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,090
<i>And as we were going
out the door,</i>

1449
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:58,460
<i>Fred goldberg goes,
"is he serious?"</i>

1450
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,100
<i>And i said, "yeah."</i>

1451
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:02,300
And he sort of breathed
this sigh of relief,

1452
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,490
Kind of nodded,
and smiled.

1453
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,270
<i>At the church's
victory party,</i>

1454
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:10,070
<i>Miscavige projected photos
of the church's executives</i>

1455
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:13,660
<i>Celebrating
with irs officials.</i>

1456
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:16,750
<i>It created
this tremendous juggernaut</i>

1457
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:21,370
<i>Of tight conspiracy
of the membership
that then existed,</i>

1458
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,760
<i>But what it really did
was enable miscavige</i>

1459
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:28,040
To milk every last dime

1460
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:29,880
Out of that core membership.

1461
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:34,010
I am proud to announce
the discrimination is over.

1462
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,930
Your tax dona--

1463
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:38,000
Deductions on donations
to scientology

1464
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:41,560
Will no longer be disallowed
by the internal revenue service.

1465
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,890
<i>In the '80s,
while hubbard was in hiding,</i>

1466
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:50,530
<i>Scientology was going through
some very severe litigation,</i>

1467
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,400
<i>In particular,
a lawsuit in oregon,</i>

1468
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:53,980
<i>And one in los angeles.</i>

1469
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,540
<i>One of them did produce
a $30 million judgment.</i>

1470
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:58,370
<i>This scared scientology.</i>

1471
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,290
<i>They realized
they were vulnerable.</i>

1472
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:01,740
And so they
asked scientologists,

1473
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:03,990
"okay, give us
a few thousand dollars.

1474
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:06,250
<i>"you'll get a nice ribbon
or something.</i>

1475
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,370
<i>"you're not gonna get
any courses from it."
and this was new,</i>

1476
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:10,370
<i>The idea that you would
give them money</i>

1477
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,550
<i>Just to defend
against lawsuits.</i>

1478
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:13,890
<i>And that grew and grew.</i>

1479
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,720
Now scientologists
are constantly

1480
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:20,060
Under intense pressure
just to hand money over.

1481
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,650
They pitch themselves
as being the underdog,

1482
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:27,270
As being the victim.
And you identify with that.

1483
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,890
But then they start
hitting you up

1484
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,020
For bigger donations,
and bigger-- and i got
a lot of pressure.

1485
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:34,270
And i think
i donated another $250,000
to them under pressure.

1486
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:35,890
They really know
how to do it.

1487
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:38,280
They really know how to do it,
and he just was after me
and after me.

1488
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:40,530
And they said,
"we're under attack, paul."

1489
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,670
This one guy who donated
$25 million,

1490
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:45,070
For no-- you know,
just straight donation,

1491
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:47,500
To this--
to the scientology war chest.

1492
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,010
<i>Churches are tax-exempt</i>

1493
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,100
<i>Because they're supposed
to provide a public good.</i>

1494
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:57,260
<i>To prove that good
to the irs,</i>

1495
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,720
<i>Churches aren't supposed
to hoard their money.</i>

1496
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,720
<i>They're supposed to spend it
on services for the faithful.</i>

1497
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,890
<i>Under this pretense,
the church had made
massive investments</i>

1498
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:08,980
<i>In tax-free real estate
all over the world.</i>

1499
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:11,700
<i>And when it comes
to labor costs,</i>

1500
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:15,400
<i>They are almost free.</i>

1501
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:17,480
The max i got paid,
you know,

1502
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:20,270
On a weekly basis
was 50 bucks,

1503
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:22,240
Um, for 28 years.

1504
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:25,610
Sea org workers
take home something

1505
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:29,210
Between six and 40 cents
an hour.

1506
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:32,950
So if you've got
very low labor costs,

1507
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:37,140
No taxes to pay,
and wealthy people
giving you donations,

1508
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:41,810
<i>You can see why
scientology has amassed
huge piles of money.</i>

1509
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,290
<i>How much are they worth?</i>

1510
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,650
<i>This was a bit of a mystery,
but just recently,</i>

1511
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,960
<i>I obtained tax records
that scientology</i>

1512
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:49,800
<i>Does have to turn in.</i>

1513
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:52,300
<i>Three of the main entities
of scientology--</i>

1514
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,990
<i>And there are 20
or 30 of them--</i>

1515
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,470
<i>But the top three,
just on their own,</i>

1516
01:13:56,490 --> 01:14:00,160
<i>Have a book value
of $1.5 billion.</i>

1517
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:04,620
It's stunning how much money
a nonprofit

1518
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,200
Has been able to amass.

1519
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:20,800
It is a crime
that we've given them
religious recognition

1520
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,500
And that
they can hide behind it.

1521
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,690
<i>Meanwhile, you got
very good people in there,</i>

1522
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,170
<i>And their lives
are being destroyed.</i>

1523
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,110
<i>When i started
this story,</i>

1524
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,480
<i>I stumbled across
an fbi investigation
of the church.</i>

1525
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,350
<i>They were investigating
human trafficking.</i>

1526
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,450
<i>It seemed that people
were being confined
against their will.</i>

1527
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,990
<i>There were lots
of reports of people
being physically abused,</i>

1528
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:45,160
And the exploitation
of labor and child labor.

1529
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:49,240
All of these things
were questions that
the fbi had.

1530
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,910
<i>While that investigation
was going on,</i>

1531
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,080
<i>A case was being heard
in colorado--</i>

1532
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:58,000
<i>The headleys,
who were suing the church</i>

1533
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,720
<i>For many
of these same violations.</i>

1534
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,390
<i>And the court
ruled in that case</i>

1535
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:07,010
<i>That these are all
essentially practices</i>

1536
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:10,180
<i>That are protected
by the religious clause</i>

1537
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:12,880
<i>Of the first amendment.</i>

1538
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,400
Once that ruling came out,

1539
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,690
The fbi dropped
its investigation.

1540
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:21,190
I think it was an indication
that the church is protected.

1541
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,580
Before ending cycle
completely on the irs,

1542
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:27,250
There is one thing
i do wish to do.

1543
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,400
Sir. Done.

1544
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,980
<i>The "we stand tall" thing--</i>

1545
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:31,760
<i>This again was part
of this whole irs thing.</i>

1546
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,260
<i>And miscavige kind of
had this song composed</i>

1547
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,570
<i>By the musician group
they had up at the studio.</i>

1548
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,520
<i>He was trying
to turn this into--</i>

1549
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:41,410
This was a result of the power
of this movement...

1550
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:52,620
...Which was such bullshit,

1551
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,340
<i>Because it was
all about control.</i>

1552
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:59,320
<i>When he got absolute control,
he went absolutely bonkers.</i>

1553
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:14,020
<i>You know, most religions
are tax-exempt</i>

1554
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,020
<i>And many have beliefs
and practices</i>

1555
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:19,280
<i>That in the modern context
would be considered strange.</i>

1556
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:20,890
Is scientology any different?

1557
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,230
I mean,
if you go to a christian

1558
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,150
Or a jew or a muslim,
and ask them,

1559
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,680
"what do you believe?",

1560
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:28,320
They can basically describe

1561
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:31,370
The most important parts
of their religion

1562
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:32,990
In a minute or two.

1563
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,690
Well, what does
a scientologist believe?

1564
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:37,460
You need to be in scientology
for seven or eight years,

1565
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,860
And in for a couple hundred
thousand dollars,

1566
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,920
Before you finally
learn this backstory

1567
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:43,830
Of xenu
the galactic overlord.

1568
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:45,750
Now, if you were told that
on day one,

1569
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,750
How many people would join?

1570
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:49,470
But if they were
upfront about it,

1571
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:51,090
I'd have more respect
for them.

1572
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,840
But it's that sort of
bait and switch

1573
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,980
That people are told,
"oh, it's an applied philosophy

1574
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:57,050
"to help you
with your communication."

1575
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:58,730
Oh, yeah?

1576
01:17:58,770 --> 01:18:01,050
So why is tom cruise
paying 1,000 bucks

1577
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:04,220
To have invisible aliens
pulled out of his body?

1578
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,500
<i>What happens when
your zone of influence</i>

1579
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:16,030
<i>Is the global stage?</i>

1580
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:20,500
<i>How much must one do
to call themselves
a scientologist?</i>

1581
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:23,570
<i>How much so that
when their head
hits the pillow,</i>

1582
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:25,710
They can live
with themselves,

1583
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:28,460
Knowing they did
all they could do?

1584
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:30,800
That is our final story
this evening.

1585
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:34,470
It's a story that affects
every scientologist,

1586
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,690
For all of us
are the beneficiaries
of what he presents.

1587
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:43,310
<i>Tom cruise was the guy.</i>

1588
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:47,530
<i>Miscavige and cruise
had been pretty buddy-buddy,</i>

1589
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:50,650
Way back
to "days of thunder."

1590
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:54,700
<i>He was on the set with him,
he went skydiving with him,</i>

1591
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:58,070
<i>Was hangin' out with him
all the time.</i>

1592
01:18:58,130 --> 01:19:00,780
<i>And that was when
tom first met nicole.</i>

1593
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,250
<i>He had really fallen for her.</i>

1594
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,580
<i>They got married,</i>

1595
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,670
<i>And this posed
a dilemma for the church,</i>

1596
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,170
<i>Because her father</i>

1597
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:13,390
<i>Is a well-known psychologist
in australia.</i>

1598
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:15,680
From the church's perspective,
he's the enemy.

1599
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:17,640
He's a suppressive person.

1600
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,310
How could you ignore me
like this?

1601
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:21,060
<i>Because nicole is still</i>

1602
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,650
<i>In a relationship
with her father,</i>

1603
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:25,970
<i>That makes her dangerous.</i>

1604
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:29,520
<i>She's a potential
trouble source, pts.</i>

1605
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:33,330
<i>And because tom
is related to her,</i>

1606
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,780
<i>This all causes trouble
from the church's perspective.</i>

1607
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:38,700
You have to
break that dynamic.

1608
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,820
<i>Nicole-- her biggest beef</i>

1609
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:46,540
<i>Was that tom was becoming
increasingly like dave.</i>

1610
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:49,330
<i>She really got him
to drift away from the church,</i>

1611
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:53,210
And tom was not
really actively involved
in scientology

1612
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:56,970
Between '92-ish
all the way up until 2001.

1613
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:02,110
<i>They were away
for more than a year</i>

1614
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,940
<i>Shooting "eyes wide shut"
in the uk.</i>

1615
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:08,900
And cruise was not in touch
with miscavige,

1616
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:11,280
And this
drove miscavige crazy.

1617
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,020
I was assigned to, um,
get him back in.

1618
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,320
And that was coincident with,
and-- and i was to facilitate

1619
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,660
The breakup
with nicole kidman.

1620
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,570
And how'd you do that?

1621
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:24,210
Uh, well,
through a lot of auditing.

1622
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:27,830
<i>And every session
i ever gave to tom cruise--</i>

1623
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:31,920
<i>And there was dozens
upon dozens of them
over a three-year period--</i>

1624
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:33,700
<i>I had to write
detailed reports</i>

1625
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,220
<i>And send them directly
to david miscavige.</i>

1626
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:38,640
<i>I would sit there every night
with our scotch</i>

1627
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,980
And watch and listen
to miscavige comment

1628
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:44,680
About cruise's sex life,
and what-- yeah,

1629
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,520
How perverted he was.

1630
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:50,220
<i>Why is he gettin'
daily reports on cruise?</i>

1631
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,740
<i>Miscavige really wanted
to get him back</i>

1632
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:54,410
<i>Into being somebody
that he could use</i>

1633
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:58,280
To lure people
into scientology
and increase his own status.

1634
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:01,110
<i>And i was also involved
in the legal team</i>

1635
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:06,090
<i>And actually
hiring investigators
to investigate nicole.</i>

1636
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,750
Men have to stick it in
every place they can,

1637
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:09,790
But for women--
women, it is just about

1638
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,710
Security and commitment--

1639
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:14,010
<i>Tom wanted to know exactly
who she was talking to,</i>

1640
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:16,850
<i>And so he wanted
to tap her phone.</i>

1641
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,770
If you men only knew.

1642
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,270
When i reported that day
to miscavige,

1643
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:25,590
I reported it,
like, "i mean, he wants
to tap her phone."

1644
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:27,890
He said,
"god damn it, get it done."

1645
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:31,730
<i>And so i arranged,
through the scientology's
consigliere,</i>

1646
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,360
<i>To get
a private investigator</i>

1647
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,950
Who physically installed
a wiretap on her home.

1648
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:38,940
And those tapes
would come in,

1649
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:42,410
<i>And i forwarded them
to dave miscavige.</i>

1650
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:44,910
<i>The church then turned
its attention</i>

1651
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:49,210
To their adopted children,
to turn them against
their mother

1652
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:52,300
<i>And make sure
that the custody went to tom.</i>

1653
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:58,470
<i> Tommy davis,
he was my liaison</i>

1654
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:01,810
Who had to do all the things
that are required

1655
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,230
To please tom cruise

1656
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:05,980
While he was being put through
the scientology hoops by me.

1657
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:10,520
<i>He also was
part of this whole
reeducation program,</i>

1658
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:13,690
<i>So that they would conclude
that their mother</i>

1659
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:16,190
<i>Was a suppressive person.</i>

1660
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,410
<i>And that was successful.</i>

1661
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,330
<i>It was all going
according to plan.</i>

1662
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:23,080
And of course,
miscavige would really

1663
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,870
Pump the oxygen
into that little fire,
you know.

1664
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,320
<i>Miscavige was brilliant
at flaming people's fears,</i>

1665
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,460
<i>And building up their egos.</i>

1666
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:37,210
<i>So you were
being audited by marty</i>

1667
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:39,350
<i>At the same time
he was auditing cruise?</i>

1668
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, i was--
yeah, tom cruise.

1669
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,180
Tom would go in,
and i would go in,
and tom would go in,

1670
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:46,850
And i would go in,
and so, you know...

1671
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:49,860
And i had been audited
by the best auditors
on the planet.

1672
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:52,140
The best auditor,
hands down,

1673
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:54,730
I mean, like--
like kinda michael jordan,

1674
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:57,400
Wayne gretsky,
kinda auditor is marty.

1675
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:00,030
<i></i>

1676
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:03,040
<i>They stole him,
you know?</i>

1677
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:06,190
<i>Tom thinks he's supposed
to be david miscavige.</i>

1678
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,540
By 2004, tom cruise
was the most gung-ho
scientologist in the world,

1679
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:12,750
And miscavige wanted
to recognize him for it.

1680
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,530
<i>He called it
the freedom medal of valor</i>

1681
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:19,090
<i>And they put together
this 35-minute video.</i>

1682
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:24,010
<i>Ias freedom medal
of valor winner, tom cruise!</i>

1683
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,380
<i> In it, they just
pump up this idea</i>

1684
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:31,060
<i>That tom cruise
is the ambassador
of scientology to the world.</i>

1685
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:33,770
<i>He's known as
the biggest movie star ever.</i>

1686
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,550
Tom cruise
travels this world,

1687
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:37,720
<i>Meeting with ministers,
ambassadors,</i>

1688
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,320
<i>And the american
state department,</i>

1689
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:44,360
<i>Advancing lrh technology
straight into the corridors
of power.</i>

1690
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:46,030
It's about
improving conditions.

1691
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:48,200
It allows you to find out
for yourself.

1692
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:49,700
There's things
that we can do to help.

1693
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,500
They even did
a calculation,

1694
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,670
Where they figured
between his films

1695
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:55,740
And all the "opinion leaders"
that he had met

1696
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,370
And all the travel
he had done...

1697
01:23:57,410 --> 01:24:00,260
<i>Tom cruise has introduced
lrh technology</i>

1698
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:03,910
To over one billion people
of earth.

1699
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:07,220
<i> No question,
he has been a huge asset
to them.</i>

1700
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:09,920
<i>Which is why the story
of tom cruise,</i>

1701
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:15,060
<i>Scientologist,
has only just begun.</i>

1702
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:17,090
I think it's a privilege
to call yourself
a scientologist,

1703
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:18,950
And it's something
that you have to earn.

1704
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,900
Scientology loves to use
this word "end phenomena."

1705
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:23,780
Every level
has an end phenomena,

1706
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:25,120
You know, that you attain,

1707
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,150
<i>And tom cruise shows that.</i>

1708
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:30,660
<i>That video
with him in the black
turtleneck sweater?</i>

1709
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:32,460
A scientologist is someone
who can look at the world

1710
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:34,610
And really see what it is.

1711
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:37,750
Not only
look at it and see it,
but be able to go,

1712
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:41,000
Poof, and be effective,
and do something about it.

1713
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:43,920
<i>And he's as arrogant
and as untouchable</i>

1714
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,340
<i>As could possibly be.</i>

1715
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:48,470
At the same time,
he looks like an utter
crazy paranoiac.

1716
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:55,270
And, uh...
I know-- you know, she...

1717
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:58,940
They, said, "so, like
have you met an sp?"

1718
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:06,110
And i looked at her,

1719
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:09,080
And i thought, "oh,
what a beautiful thing,"

1720
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:11,780
Because maybe one day,
it'll be like that.

1721
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,920
You know what i'm saying?
Maybe one day,

1722
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:16,790
It will be that--
"wow. Sp's?"

1723
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,370
Like, they'll just
read about those

1724
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,320
In the history books,
you know?

1725
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:22,210
That's where it takes you.

1726
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:25,850
That's the end phenomena
of the scientology bridge.

1727
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,960
All scientologists
are full of shit.

1728
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,130
You know, they lie.
"aw, i'm doing great!

1729
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:32,020
"you gotta get on seven."

1730
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:34,020
You know,
and they're fucking--

1731
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,440
"i've got a fucking migraine
right now,

1732
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:39,280
"and i've never
felt so shitty!"

1733
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:41,680
You know,
that's the fucking life.

1734
01:25:44,030 --> 01:25:47,020
There's nothing
part of the way for me!

1735
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:50,790
It's just-- whoo!

1736
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,620
<i>He drank the kool-aid.</i>

1737
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:55,120
<i>And in the eyes of miscavige,</i>

1738
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:59,710
Tom cruise is the perfect
scientology celebrity.

1739
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,580
And nobody's benefited more
from his membership.

1740
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:05,250
I mean, the amount
of free sea org labor.

1741
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:08,700
<i>Sea org members make
40 cents an hour,</i>

1742
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,510
<i>And i don't think
there's any way</i>

1743
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:12,310
Tom cruise
is not aware of that.

1744
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,680
The church
has done so much for him.

1745
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,900
They tricked out all his cars
and his motorcycles.

1746
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:19,350
"oh, i want a new limo."
"we'll build it for you."

1747
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:22,490
<i>Decked out tom cruise's hangar
in santa monica.</i>

1748
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:26,570
<i>Installed all
the audiovisual stuff
in cruise's home.</i>

1749
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:28,910
<i>Tom cruise had expressed
this fantasy</i>

1750
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:32,250
<i>Of wanting
to run through a meadow
with nicole kidman.</i>

1751
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,580
<i>And so everybody had to work,
and till the soil.</i>

1752
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:36,870
And then david miscavige
didn't like it,

1753
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:39,440
And so the whole thing
had to be ripped up again.

1754
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:41,750
<i>This was at the gold facility,</i>

1755
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:43,420
<i>Which is this desert facility,</i>

1756
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:45,840
<i>Where this is all kinds
of great stuff,</i>

1757
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,430
<i>If you're tom cruise,
you know?</i>

1758
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,130
<i>Wonderful living quarters
and a gym.</i>

1759
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:51,800
When cruise comes up,
everyone's told in advance,

1760
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:53,750
"you better have
a fucking smile on your face."

1761
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:55,850
<i>Everyone had to
call cruise "sir."</i>

1762
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:59,860
<i>
</i>

1763
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:21,660
Thank you.

1764
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:23,630
<i> It's this
side-by-side world.</i>

1765
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:25,830
<i>There are celebrities
like cruise and travolta,</i>

1766
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,330
<i>And then, you know,
there are people</i>

1767
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:30,640
<i>Who tell terrible tales
of what happened to them
in the church--</i>

1768
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:35,170
Being imprisoned
and really horrible
psychological games.

1769
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,760
<i>Tom was in spain.</i>

1770
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:44,020
<i>They were opening up
a new scientology church
in madrid.</i>

1771
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:46,690
<i>And he was overheard
to complain</i>

1772
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:48,650
That he needed
a new girlfriend.

1773
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:52,660
<i>Soon after that,
a young scientologist
premed student</i>

1774
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:55,750
<i>Named nazanin boniadi--
she was told</i>

1775
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:58,410
That she was going to get
a special assignment.

1776
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:00,150
...Number of transactions
increase...

1777
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:03,090
<i>Years later, nazanin became
a successful tv actress</i>

1778
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:06,510
<i>And she would
have a small part
in a paul haggis film.</i>

1779
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:09,430
<i>But at the time,
she was a dedicated
young scientologist</i>

1780
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,490
<i>Who believed
in the church's claims</i>

1781
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:13,460
<i>For its humanitarian
mission.</i>

1782
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,770
<i>In fact,
she set a monthly record</i>

1783
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:19,020
<i>For selling books
for the church.</i>

1784
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:22,510
<i>Nazanin may not
speak publicly
about her experiences</i>

1785
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,530
<i>Because of an nda
the church pressured her
to sign,</i>

1786
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,840
<i>But i discovered details
from fbi testimony</i>

1787
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:31,110
<i>Regarding her ordeal.</i>

1788
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:33,650
<i>David miscavige
assigned nazanin's case</i>

1789
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:36,290
<i>To a key church official,
greg wilhere.</i>

1790
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,450
<i>He put her through
a one-month program</i>

1791
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:43,330
<i>Of on-camera interviews,
intensive auditing,
and security checks.</i>

1792
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,550
She was moved
into the celebrity center,

1793
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:49,030
<i>Separated from her family,
and certain problems
were addressed</i>

1794
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:50,630
<i>During this period of time.</i>

1795
01:28:50,670 --> 01:28:52,970
<i>One was,
she had a boyfriend.</i>

1796
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,920
<i>She is handed a transcript
of his auditing session,</i>

1797
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:59,380
<i>In which he admitted
that he had an affair.</i>

1798
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:01,430
<i>And so she broke up
with him.</i>

1799
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,760
<i>Then wilhere took her
to an orthodontist</i>

1800
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:05,010
<i>To have her braces removed.</i>

1801
01:29:05,050 --> 01:29:07,180
<i>At burberry and other stores
in beverly hills,</i>

1802
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:10,890
<i>He bought her $20,000
worth of clothes.</i>

1803
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:13,240
<i>At the celebrity centre,
a man who worked</i>

1804
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:14,820
<i>For cruise's hair stylist</i>

1805
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:17,890
<i>Colored nazanin's hair
to cruise's liking.</i>

1806
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:19,910
<i>Nazanin was told
that her makeover</i>

1807
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:22,780
<i>Was a part
of the church's
humanitarian mission.</i>

1808
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:27,240
<i>She had to look
her best for conferences
with world leaders.</i>

1809
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:32,910
<i>Only after she was flown
first class to new york</i>

1810
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:34,790
<i>Did she discover
the actual role</i>

1811
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:37,130
<i>That the church
wanted her to play.</i>

1812
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:41,880
<i>She was to be the girlfriend
of scientology's biggest star.</i>

1813
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:46,610
<i>Within a month,
nazanin was living
with cruise.</i>

1814
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,560
<i>While at his house
in telluride,</i>

1815
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:50,030
<i>Miscavige came to visit.</i>

1816
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,200
<i>Overcome
by a severe headache,</i>

1817
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:55,100
<i>Nazanin had a hard time
understanding miscavige,</i>

1818
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:56,630
<i>Which infuriated him.</i>

1819
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:59,100
<i>The next day, cruise,
inches from her face,</i>

1820
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,950
<i>Pounded his fist on the table
and screamed at her</i>

1821
01:30:01,990 --> 01:30:04,240
<i>For insulting the head
of the church.</i>

1822
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,610
<i>Two weeks later,
church henchman tommy davis</i>

1823
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:09,160
<i>Delivered
the news to nazanin--</i>

1824
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:11,660
<i>The relationship with cruise
was over.</i>

1825
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,000
And they, according to her,

1826
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:15,220
Came to her apartment
with her mom

1827
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:18,090
And found every photograph
of the two of them together,

1828
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:21,060
And took them away.
Every scrap, every letter,
everything,

1829
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:23,840
They...
As if it never existed.

1830
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,850
<i>And she was really upset,</i>

1831
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,560
<i>Because she
had been really hurt
by the whole thing.</i>

1832
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:31,130
<i>And she made the mistake
of telling her friend,</i>

1833
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:34,490
<i>Who immediately went to tell
someone in the church.</i>

1834
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,970
<i>She agreed
to do punishments,</i>

1835
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:39,190
<i>Like cleaning out
the public bathrooms</i>

1836
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,280
<i>On her hands and knees
with a toothbrush,</i>

1837
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:47,030
<i>While other people she knew
were stepping over her.</i>

1838
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:49,040
She did nothing wrong,
other than tell her friend

1839
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:51,590
That she was heartbroken,
and this is the way
she was treated?

1840
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:53,510
<i></i>

1841
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:56,490
<i>The church claims that
miscavige has no involvement</i>

1842
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:58,490
<i>In cruise's personal life</i>

1843
01:30:58,510 --> 01:31:02,550
<i>And that the search
for cruise's girlfriend
never existed.</i>

1844
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:09,360
I wanna tell you something.

1845
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:13,030
I have never met
a more competent,

1846
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:16,060
A more intelligent,
a more tolerant,

1847
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:18,350
A more compassionate being,

1848
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:23,570
Outside of what
i've experienced from lrh.

1849
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:26,660
And i've met the leaders
of leaders.

1850
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,740
Okay? I've met them all.

1851
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:30,190
And so i say to you,
sir, cob,

1852
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:33,030
We are lucky to have you
and thank you very much.

1853
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:36,330
<i>While miscavige
would do anything</i>

1854
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:38,500
<i>For the church's
most famous celebrity,</i>

1855
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:40,420
<i>Miscavige began
to turn against</i>

1856
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:43,420
<i>The sea org's
highest-ranking executives.</i>

1857
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:47,060
<i> He pretty much
had international management
shut down.</i>

1858
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:49,350
He was into
this deep paranoia thing

1859
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:50,900
About everybody is
out to get him.

1860
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:53,930
He very definitely

1861
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:56,550
Wiped out
that organizational pattern

1862
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:58,900
In order to be able
to have ultimate power.

1863
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:01,190
<i>In 2004,</i>

1864
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:04,240
<i>Miscavige ordered
the top officers
of the sea org</i>

1865
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,530
<i>To the scientology's
gold base</i>

1866
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,080
<i>In southern california.</i>

1867
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,170
<i>He forced them
to live in a pair
of double-wide trailers</i>

1868
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,590
<i>That came to be called
"the hole."</i>

1869
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:15,590
<i>The doors had bars
put on them,</i>

1870
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:17,920
<i>The windows all had bars
put on them,</i>

1871
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:20,340
<i>And there was
one entrance door</i>

1872
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:23,510
<i>That a security guard
sat at 24 hours a day.</i>

1873
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:25,600
<i>They had to stay there,
sleep there.</i>

1874
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:29,020
<i>It stunk and,
you know, there were ants
crawling around.</i>

1875
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:31,300
You'd sleep about an hour
or two hours a night.

1876
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,640
Um, you were
in such a mental state

1877
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:36,360
That you're very controllable,
very suggestible.

1878
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:38,930
<i>We were told
we needed to come up</i>

1879
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:41,310
<i>With what
each other's crimes were</i>

1880
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:43,150
<i>Against miscavige and hubbard,</i>

1881
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,150
<i>So that we could eventually
get out of the hole.</i>

1882
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,570
<i>Scientology is really good</i>

1883
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:49,960
At making you think
that you are a scoundrel.

1884
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:53,380
"confess your crimes!
Confess your crimes!
What have you done?"

1885
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:54,490
<i>Fights would break out.</i>

1886
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:57,330
Miscavige would get me
all riled up.

1887
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:59,450
And i remember one time,
mike had done something,

1888
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:01,300
<i>Or not done something,
i don't remember,</i>

1889
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:03,250
<i>And i was supposed to
go beat him up.</i>

1890
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:05,500
<i>One executive was made
to mop up</i>

1891
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,420
<i>The bathroom floor
with his tongue.</i>

1892
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:10,290
<i>Another was put
into a bucket,</i>

1893
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:13,260
And pummeled
by some of the women,
and called a lesbian.

1894
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:16,320
<i>There was a very powerful
air conditioner,</i>

1895
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:17,800
<i>Which blew straight down,</i>

1896
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:19,900
<i>It was set
on maximum cold,</i>

1897
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:22,070
<i>And a guy was
made to sit in a chair,</i>

1898
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:23,740
<i>And had water
poured on his head</i>

1899
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:27,030
<i>Until he literally
turned blue.</i>

1900
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:29,200
Miscavige slapped me
across the face,

1901
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:30,980
Knocked me on the ground,
kicked me a couple times.

1902
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,250
Flailing fists,
kneeing him in the stomach,

1903
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,750
Getting him on the floor.

1904
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:39,320
And you think,
you want to get up
and retaliate,

1905
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:42,340
But you also think,
"i got 75 other people

1906
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:46,680
"who are all likely
to tackle me if i did"...

1907
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:50,430
And then you got
the sheer shock of it.

1908
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:52,270
Here's the equivalent
of the pope

1909
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,670
Suddenly knocking you
on the ground,

1910
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:56,270
And you're thinking,

1911
01:33:56,310 --> 01:34:00,030
"i must have
really screwed up."

1912
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:03,950
<i> It was
a poisonous environment.</i>

1913
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:06,150
<i>People were
really frightened.</i>

1914
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:08,650
<i>And this went on for years.</i>

1915
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:10,820
This isn't a couple of days.

1916
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:13,360
<i>The nominal president
of the church,</i>

1917
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:14,710
<i>This man
named heber jentszch,</i>

1918
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:16,380
<i>He was in there
for seven years.</i>

1919
01:34:16,410 --> 01:34:17,960
<i>What is the statement?</i>

1920
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,860
<i>"god helps those
who help themselves."</i>

1921
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,410
Well, in scientology,
we're engaged

1922
01:34:21,470 --> 01:34:23,130
In helping people
help themselves,

1923
01:34:23,170 --> 01:34:27,220
So they can
fully comprehend
and understand god.

1924
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:35,900
<i>One night,</i>

1925
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:38,810
<i>Miscavige comes
into the hole with a boom box.</i>

1926
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:42,320
<i>He said, "i'm gonna
teach you all a lesson.</i>

1927
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:44,850
"we're all gonna play
musical chairs."

1928
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:46,490
And musical chairs
is a scientology

1929
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,360
Administrative term
for when you move people

1930
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:51,780
From different posts rapidly,
and you create instability.

1931
01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:53,110
They played
the damned music.

1932
01:34:58,290 --> 01:34:59,740
<i> He said,
"we're gonna play it</i>

1933
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:01,920
<i>To 'bohemian rhapsody'
by queen."</i>

1934
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,510
<i>And he emphasized the line...</i>

1935
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:07,960
..."nothing matters anymore."
and that's your whole attitude,

1936
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:09,680
That's where you live,
that's who you are.

1937
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:10,960
Playing that music,
and stop it,

1938
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:12,550
And everyone would
have to grab a chair.

1939
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:14,580
And there's one person
left standing.

1940
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:24,140
<i>What miscavige
has warned them</i>

1941
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:27,400
Is that the last person
who remains gets to stay.

1942
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:28,760
"everybody else,
you're expelled.

1943
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:30,480
<i>"you're going to be thrown out
of the sea org."</i>

1944
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:35,070
These people were fighting
to stay in the hole.

1945
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:38,110
<i>Throwing people around,
scratching, kicking.</i>

1946
01:35:38,130 --> 01:35:41,080
<i>They're tearing chairs apart,
they're ripping clothing.</i>

1947
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:42,380
<i>And whatever it took.</i>

1948
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:51,720
But then nothing happens.

1949
01:35:56,790 --> 01:36:00,060
"out of the goodness
of my heart, you can stay.

1950
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:02,260
"but you better come clean.
You better--

1951
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,480
"i better have some good
confessions out of you."

1952
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:08,150
I-- i mean, you--
you know...

1953
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:11,360
As much as they
get into everything
that you ever think or do,

1954
01:36:11,410 --> 01:36:13,910
They never got into my think
on this score,

1955
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:16,330
That i would never
go to prison.

1956
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:19,500
And so it was inevitable,
when i got-- when i--

1957
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:22,080
He literally created
this prison camp.

1958
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:26,120
Um, it was inevitable
that i wasn't gonna
last there.

1959
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:34,380
It's embarrassing to have
ever been involved with,

1960
01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:35,970
To think about it.

1961
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,050
"god, i can't even believe
i'm talkin' about it."

1962
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:39,640
But it was bad.

1963
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:44,710
<i>Let's say the fbi
showed up at the hole,</i>

1964
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:47,110
And said, "this is the fbi.
We're lettin' everyone out."

1965
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:49,780
Do you think everyone
would have said, "oh,
thank god, the fbi's here"?

1966
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:52,530
No. I think that everybody,
one for one,

1967
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:54,650
Would have gone,
"what do you mean?

1968
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:56,870
"we-- we're doing this
voluntarily.

1969
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:59,370
"we like living
in these conditions."

1970
01:36:59,410 --> 01:37:00,790
Over the past week,

1971
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:02,570
We've been reporting on
allegations of physical abuse

1972
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:03,990
Inside
the church of scientology.

1973
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:06,130
We spoke with the ex-wives
of some of the men

1974
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:07,580
Making the claims of abuse.

1975
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:09,300
<i>I read all of your affidavits.</i>

1976
01:37:09,330 --> 01:37:11,330
Obviously, your ex-husbands
have made charges

1977
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:12,800
Against david miscavige,

1978
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:15,550
Saying that
they have seen repeated acts
of physical violence

1979
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:16,840
Perpetrated by mr. Miscavige.

1980
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:18,970
Is-- is any of that true?

1981
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:21,510
No. No.
Not one ounce of it.

1982
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:24,180
That's not the character
of mr. David miscavige.

1983
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:27,520
<i> My ex-wife,
marty rathbun's ex-wife,</i>

1984
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:31,240
<i>Tom de vocht's ex-wife,
that were on "anderson cooper,"</i>

1985
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,570
They all came out of the hole!

1986
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:36,160
They were all sent there
to do that.

1987
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:38,410
They went back to the hole!

1988
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:40,200
<i>It's just ridiculous.</i>

1989
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:42,700
<i>This line
that my ex-wife said...</i>

1990
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:45,750
I lived with mike rinder
for over 35 years.

1991
01:37:45,790 --> 01:37:48,040
I know every square inch
of mike rinder's body.

1992
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:50,870
She said it
because she was told
to say it by miscavige.

1993
01:37:50,910 --> 01:37:54,010
And the proof of that is,
when tom de vocht's ex-wife

1994
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:57,880
<i>Then repeated the same thing
over again...</i>

1995
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,930
I know every inch of him.

1996
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:01,720
<i>You gotta be kidding me!</i>

1997
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:02,850
Everything that happens

1998
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:04,720
From the church of scientology
is scripted.

1999
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:06,770
Don't ever turn
the other cheek and acquiesce,

2000
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:08,560
Hit 'em back.

2001
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:12,780
Marty rathbun
suddenly went and leapt
on top of mike rinder

2002
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:14,560
And fought him to the ground

2003
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,120
And started choking him
and beating him.

2004
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:19,120
And nothing seems
to have been done about it.

2005
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:21,040
Mr. Miscavige was not
at the property at the time.

2006
01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:22,540
Do you not have telephones?

2007
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:24,070
Of course we have telephones.

2008
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:26,410
I think
you're being quite rude
and quite insulting.

2009
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,610
Here's the bottom line.
Here's the bottom line--

2010
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:31,160
There is no history
of violence in the church.

2011
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:34,080
As somebody who ran pr
for the church for a long time,

2012
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:37,720
Do you have any regret
for anything that you did
in that capacity?

2013
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:40,170
Well,
i think the biggest regret

2014
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:44,640
<i>Is when john sweeney
at "panorama" was doing
his program,</i>

2015
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:47,010
<i>It was the culmination
of a lot--</i>

2016
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:49,430
<i>I mean, i'd been
in the hole for a year.</i>

2017
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:52,520
<i>And i ended up
being sent to england.</i>

2018
01:38:52,570 --> 01:38:55,100
<i>Hi, mike.
 He was
constantly going,</i>

2019
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:58,610
"well, why do you
have private investigators
following me?"

2020
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,740
I'm like...
That never happened!

2021
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:02,310
Ever, ever happened!

2022
01:39:02,330 --> 01:39:03,860
And of course there were.

2023
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:05,660
I was following john sweeney.

2024
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:08,370
Oh, there it is.

2025
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:11,340
Okay, there we are.

2026
01:39:11,370 --> 01:39:13,040
<i>He's got his camera,</i>

2027
01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:14,840
<i>He's standing there
and he's saying,</i>

2028
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,290
<i>"i want a response.
I have credible witnesses.</i>

2029
01:39:18,330 --> 01:39:22,600
"did david miscavige
physically assault you?"

2030
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:23,850
And i said...

2031
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:28,350
Those allegations
are absolute, utter rubbish.

2032
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:31,140
Absolute, utter rubbish.

2033
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:33,030
You have been assaulted
by miscavige?

2034
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:35,440
Many times, many times.

2035
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:38,480
Perhaps more
than anybody else.

2036
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:42,700
I was now sort of

2037
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:45,700
At the end of my rope.

2038
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:50,490
<i>It was a real moment
of clarity for me--</i>

2039
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:52,860
<i>"i don't want
to be doing this anymore.</i>

2040
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,910
<i>"this is nuts!"</i>

2041
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:59,640
<i>That was actually
the last thing that i did
before i left.</i>

2042
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:13,770
<i>So i'd been in scientology
about two and a half years.</i>

2043
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:16,020
<i>I am kickin' ass.</i>

2044
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:19,660
I felt like i had gotten out
of the fuckin' trap.

2045
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:22,360
I didn't have to
have a problem.

2046
01:40:22,410 --> 01:40:24,690
<i>I said,
"i'm done with auditing."</i>

2047
01:40:24,730 --> 01:40:27,660
<i>But they insisted
on gettin' me back,</i>

2048
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:30,420
<i>And said just,
"believe us, believe us,
believe us."</i>

2049
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:33,170
I got so fucked up.

2050
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:36,070
I mean, they-- they--
i went insane.

2051
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:39,120
I was, like,
stuck somewhere

2052
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:41,930
In a tiny spot
behind my eyeballs,

2053
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:44,800
Looking this way.

2054
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:48,300
I mean, i--
i'd never experienced
anything like it.

2055
01:40:48,350 --> 01:40:51,190
10 fuckin' years!

2056
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:55,690
<i>I was worse than the day
that i walked in.</i>

2057
01:40:55,730 --> 01:40:58,530
It was by design,
'cause they needed to--

2058
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,530
To keep me in there.

2059
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,230
So basically, they had to

2060
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:04,900
Put a whole new case on me,
so they could run it.

2061
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:08,450
And they just kept tryin'
to fuckin' keep me stuck in.

2062
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:09,940
It was crazy!

2063
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:15,080
<i>So i finally said,
"i'm going my way.
You guys go yours."</i>

2064
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:18,960
I was pissed. I was sad.
I was disillusioned.

2065
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,220
<i>And i thought,
"maybe somebody
could interview me,</i>

2066
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:24,950
<i>"ask me some questions
about scientology."</i>

2067
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:29,120
How i got into scientology,
and why i got out.

2068
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,930
Post this two-hour thing,

2069
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:33,760
And it was the #1 thing
on youtube for two days

2070
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:35,800
Before
it "mysteriously" disappeared.

2071
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:37,020
The best traps--

2072
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:39,600
You get a guy to just
keep himself in jail.

2073
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,770
Right? And that's
what scientology does.

2074
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:45,270
<i>I started getting
all this communication</i>

2075
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:46,910
<i>Because of that video.</i>

2076
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:49,980
You know,
"you saved my family."

2077
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,950
You know, "you've--
i finally had the courage

2078
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:54,150
"to leave
after i watched your thing."

2079
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:58,790
You know?
I mean, like,
there's blood and tears.

2080
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,840
And then
i started to find out,

2081
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:03,160
You know, all the stuff
that was really happening.

2082
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:05,290
You know, i lost money,
i got fucked,

2083
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:08,660
But then i found out
about the abuse
in the sea org.

2084
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:11,670
And i felt like, "fuck me,
i gotta do somethin' about it."

2085
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:14,440
<i>And i finally
tracked down marty rathbun.</i>

2086
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:16,170
<i>Everybody thought
he was dead.</i>

2087
01:42:16,190 --> 01:42:18,640
<i>He was in fuckin' mexico.
And i went down there,</i>

2088
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,680
<i>And i basically
convinced him to talk.</i>

2089
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:22,510
<i>And, like,
"we gotta do somethin'."</i>

2090
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:24,150
<i>And then he started his blog.</i>

2091
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:30,120
<i> There was
a beating every day.</i>

2092
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:31,450
<i>And if it wasn't him doin' it,</i>

2093
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:35,370
It was from him inciting others
to do it to others.

2094
01:42:35,410 --> 01:42:37,210
I think that it's a cult.

2095
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:39,630
I'm doin' my own thing,
i want to get on with my life.

2096
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:41,500
I am telling the truth.

2097
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:43,750
<i> Suddenly i heard
senior members of the church</i>

2098
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,370
<i>Were speaking out,</i>

2099
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:49,000
So i started to look,
and i started to read.

2100
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,010
And then i started
to reach out to people.

2101
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:54,180
<i>Two of my daughters are gay,
and told me</i>

2102
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:57,560
<i>How they'd been treated
within the church.
I didn't know.</i>

2103
01:42:57,650 --> 01:43:00,400
<i>Paul haggis's daughters
were openly harassed</i>

2104
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,480
<i>By church members
for being gay.</i>

2105
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,690
<i>Investigating further,
haggis discovered</i>

2106
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,820
<i>That church doctrine
viewed homosexuality
as a disease</i>

2107
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:10,490
<i>That only hubbard's teachings
could cure.</i>

2108
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:12,660
<i>And a california
chapter of scientology</i>

2109
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:15,830
<i>Had supported a ban
on gay marriage.</i>

2110
01:43:15,870 --> 01:43:18,030
I can't be part
of an organization

2111
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:21,340
That doesn't support

2112
01:43:21,370 --> 01:43:23,590
Human rights for everyone.

2113
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:29,260
<i>So i sent a letter
to 25 friends in the church</i>

2114
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:31,010
<i>That i was resigning.</i>

2115
01:43:31,050 --> 01:43:33,470
<i>And i'd hoped
they'd read this letter</i>

2116
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:37,890
<i>And be horrified
by the things i'd found out.</i>

2117
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:44,390
<i>A few days later,
i drive home.</i>

2118
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:46,650
<i>There have to be 10 people
standing in my front yard.</i>

2119
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:49,030
<i>I recognize them.
They're my friends.</i>

2120
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:51,930
They said, "paul,
we need you to tear up
this letter.

2121
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:54,150
"and we need you
to get all the copies
and tear them up,

2122
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,120
"and resign quietly."

2123
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,240
I said, "i don't do that."
you know?

2124
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:59,770
"i'm sorry.
I don't do that."

2125
01:43:59,790 --> 01:44:02,540
<i>I sent a copy
to marty rathbun.</i>

2126
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:05,160
<i>He put it on his blog,
one page on a day,</i>

2127
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:08,330
<i>And didn't reveal my name
until the friday.</i>

2128
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:10,390
<i>Monday morning, i woke up.</i>

2129
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:14,460
600 of the top newspapers
of the world had it.

2130
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,640
<i>You know,
it was in bulgaria.</i>

2131
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:20,600
<i>
i mean, it was reprinted
in seven languages.</i>

2132
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:23,100
I went, "oh my god,
what have i done?"

2133
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:26,570
I mean-- it did garner
a lot of interest.

2134
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,190
People will judge you,
one way or the other.

2135
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:31,640
I figured
people would judge me
as really stupid.

2136
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:33,980
But then,
i was really stupid.

2137
01:44:33,990 --> 01:44:38,650
I was a part of this
for 30 years before
i spoke out.

2138
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:42,330
<i>I felt deeply ashamed.</i>

2139
01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:46,290
<i>Why didn't i do it earlier?
Why didn't i look earlier?</i>

2140
01:44:49,210 --> 01:44:52,460
<i>People are so indoctrinated,</i>

2141
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:55,960
And have been in scientology
a really long, long time.

2142
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,970
Or they've grown up in it,
and they don't know
anything else.

2143
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,970
It's so scary to them
to have to start all over,

2144
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:06,510
And it takes
a really strong person

2145
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:08,690
To stand up to them
and say no.

2146
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,350
<i>In 2009,</i>

2147
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:16,030
<i>My son was on staff
at the church.</i>

2148
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:18,790
<i>And "the truth rundown"
came out in the
"st. Pete times,"</i>

2149
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:21,360
<i>Exposing what was going on</i>

2150
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:25,380
<i>With the beatings,
people in the hole.</i>

2151
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:26,910
The church was very mad
at my son,

2152
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:28,750
Because he knew
it was going to happen,

2153
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,670
And he didn't tell them.

2154
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:33,300
And he didn't tell them
because he had a good friend

2155
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:35,640
<i>That became friends
with mike rinder</i>

2156
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:37,560
<i>And marty rathbun,</i>

2157
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:40,930
<i>And he believed
what they were saying
in "the truth rundown."</i>

2158
01:45:43,230 --> 01:45:45,350
<i>The church was threatening,</i>

2159
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:48,180
<i>That he was gonna get declared
a suppressive person</i>

2160
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:51,600
<i>If he didn't disconnect
from his friend.</i>

2161
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:54,190
<i>My son, he was raised
a scientologist,</i>

2162
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:56,580
<i>You know,
and he'd been on staff.</i>

2163
01:45:56,610 --> 01:45:58,440
<i>He made 30 bucks a week.</i>

2164
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:00,280
<i>He headed up
their boy scout troop.</i>

2165
01:46:00,330 --> 01:46:04,030
He was like
this consummate youth
of scientology.

2166
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:08,120
<i>The continental justice chief
called him on the phone.</i>

2167
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:10,570
<i>And it was after that
the declare came down,</i>

2168
01:46:10,590 --> 01:46:13,260
<i>And he was just devastated.</i>

2169
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:17,180
<i>The church told his friends
everything they could find</i>

2170
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:21,300
<i>In his pc folder
to ruin his reputation.</i>

2171
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:24,050
<i>I wrote this petition.</i>

2172
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:28,860
<i>I tried to put in everything
good that my son had done.</i>

2173
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:30,440
"dear sarah,
thank you for the letter

2174
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:33,560
"that you sent
regarding the situation
with nick lister.

2175
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:38,600
"i cannot approve
that you continue
your connection with nick."

2176
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:41,570
No one's gonna tell me
when i can and can't
speak to him.

2177
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:44,710
No one, but me.

2178
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:47,880
"your committee
of evidence findings
and recommendations

2179
01:46:47,910 --> 01:46:50,710
"recommended you
be labeled suppressive,

2180
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:53,500
"engaging in malicious
rumor mongering

2181
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:57,140
"to destroy the authority
or repute of higher officers

2182
01:46:57,170 --> 01:47:00,470
"or the leading names
of scientology."

2183
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:02,640
My husband
was charged with that one,

2184
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:04,260
Because he was telling me

2185
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:07,300
What he read on the internet
about david miscavige.

2186
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:09,680
They say,
"don't go on the internet,
don't read.

2187
01:47:09,730 --> 01:47:11,100
"don't go to these sites."

2188
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:14,640
From the time
that i got in,

2189
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:18,360
For 30 years, i never read
one critical thing
about scientology.

2190
01:47:18,410 --> 01:47:21,080
<i>When i finally decided
to open my eyes and look,</i>

2191
01:47:21,110 --> 01:47:23,360
<i>I was shocked,
just shocked.</i>

2192
01:47:23,410 --> 01:47:25,480
But if you're a member
of the church of scientology,

2193
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:29,330
And someone in your family,
or a friend, or your spouse,

2194
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:32,920
Is skeptical or critical
of the church of scientology,

2195
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:36,040
You are supposed to disconnect
yourself from that person...

2196
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:39,680
<i> Tommy davis,
who was the spokesperson
for the church,</i>

2197
01:47:39,710 --> 01:47:43,720
He's being asked about
the policy of disconnection.

2198
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:46,380
Anything that's characterized
as disconnection

2199
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:48,550
Or this kinda thing,
it's just-- it's just not true.

2200
01:47:48,610 --> 01:47:51,140
<i>There isn't...
 I confronted him
about this.</i>

2201
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:54,190
And i said,
"tommy, i don't need
to search outside to ask for--

2202
01:47:54,230 --> 01:47:56,530
"to check research
and see if other--

2203
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,730
"this has happened
to other people.
This happened to my wife.

2204
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:01,650
"you asked her and me
to disconnect from her parents

2205
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:04,120
"because of something trivial
they did years ago."

2206
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:06,120
My wife disconnected from me,

2207
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:09,210
My daughter,
my son, my brother,

2208
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:11,210
My sister, my mother,

2209
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:13,040
All of my nieces
and nephews.

2210
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:15,550
And that is the only family
that i have.

2211
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:17,720
You know, you label
these people suppressive

2212
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:19,830
So that, you know,
everybody automatically--

2213
01:48:19,870 --> 01:48:22,170
They're discredited,
and they must disconnect
from them.

2214
01:48:22,210 --> 01:48:24,640
And that's how you keep
people in a bubble.

2215
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:27,140
And that's what they do.
I mean, my son was declared

2216
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:28,590
Because he wouldn't disconnect
from his friend.

2217
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:30,650
I was declared,
and my husband was declared

2218
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,600
Because we wouldn't
disconnect from my son.

2219
01:48:32,650 --> 01:48:34,350
And now guess what happened?

2220
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:38,190
Everyone connected to us
just scatters to the wind.

2221
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:40,360
<i>Through all of this time,</i>

2222
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:43,660
<i>I have a daughter
who's very much
into the church.</i>

2223
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:46,730
<i>I have a granddaughter</i>

2224
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:50,200
<i>Who's the love of my life,
and who loves her nana.</i>

2225
01:48:50,230 --> 01:48:53,070
<i>I was planning on talking
to my daughter,</i>

2226
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:56,170
<i>And trying to tell her
what was really happening.</i>

2227
01:48:56,210 --> 01:48:59,720
She hugged me,
she told me she loved me.

2228
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:02,810
She said, "i have to
disconnect from you."

2229
01:49:08,190 --> 01:49:11,320
So, um...

2230
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:20,860
I just was concentrating
on smelling her hair

2231
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:23,670
And seeing the way she felt,

2232
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:26,330
Touching her skin
on my face.

2233
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:32,010
<i>That's the last time
i saw them.</i>

2234
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:38,680
<i>It really is the crux</i>

2235
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:42,800
<i>Of how controlling
is any religion</i>

2236
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:45,140
<i>Over its adherents,</i>

2237
01:49:45,190 --> 01:49:48,060
<i>And scientology
has perfected</i>

2238
01:49:48,090 --> 01:49:51,440
<i>A lot of
techniques of control.</i>

2239
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:55,100
There is
no logical explanation

2240
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:58,730
As to why,
other than faith.

2241
01:49:58,790 --> 01:50:01,100
<i>Your future, your eternity,</i>

2242
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:04,290
<i>All depends on
you going up the bridge.</i>

2243
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:08,330
<i>It's scary.
It's kinda like
christianity with hell.</i>

2244
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:10,330
<i>If they don't have the bridge,
they can't go free.</i>

2245
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:14,280
<i>They don't believe
they can get it anywhere else.</i>

2246
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:16,330
It's like brainwashing.
Really simple.

2247
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:18,640
I mean,
that's a scary word,

2248
01:50:18,670 --> 01:50:21,560
And it took me a long time

2249
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:24,640
To come to that conclusion,
that that's what's occurred.

2250
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:27,150
You take on

2251
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:30,630
A kind of a--
a matrix of thought

2252
01:50:30,650 --> 01:50:35,150
That is not your own.

2253
01:50:35,190 --> 01:50:38,140
I think that's how i
and other people got involved

2254
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:40,190
And stuck through it
for so long.

2255
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:42,280
Because when you're out,
you look at it,

2256
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:45,860
And you go,
"what the crap
was i thinking," you know?

2257
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,670
It's such a hard thing
when you do wake up.

2258
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:49,580
You go, "oh my god."

2259
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:52,090
Because you have this wave
of regrets.

2260
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:56,210
<i>I just started to think
that maybe my entire life</i>

2261
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:58,130
<i>Has been a lie.</i>

2262
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:00,630
<i>You just don't see it
happening to you.</i>

2263
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:03,630
<i>You justify so much.</i>

2264
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:07,500
Cults, they prey on people,
suggesting that, you know,

2265
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,440
You should be able
to think for yourself

2266
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:13,220
And then tell you exactly
how you have to think,
or get out.

2267
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:16,900
And if you get out,
there will be consequences.

2268
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:18,650
Come on, marty.
Got anything to say?

2269
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:20,570
What's your name?
Why don't you answer
his question?

2270
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:24,320
Beat it. I said get off
my property, boy.

2271
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:27,240
The real sustained campaign

2272
01:51:27,290 --> 01:51:29,520
Began in early 2009

2273
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:33,240
<i>When i spoke to
the "st. Petersburg times."</i>

2274
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:36,460
<i>And i'd been hounded
and hunted like wild prey.</i>

2275
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:40,300
<i>It's a policy of
the office of special affairs</i>

2276
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:42,220
<i>Authored by l. Ron hubbard.</i>

2277
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:44,260
<i>When somebody's speaking out
against scientology,</i>

2278
01:51:44,310 --> 01:51:46,870
<i>Investigate to find out
who the instigator is.</i>

2279
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:48,590
I started getting calls
from the church,

2280
01:51:48,650 --> 01:51:53,150
And they're-- they're really,
uh, comin' after me.

2281
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:55,150
They showed up
at my mother's house.

2282
01:51:55,190 --> 01:51:57,070
The feeling in the pit
of your stomach

2283
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:59,220
Knowing that scientology's
chief dirty-tricks pi

2284
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:01,560
Was just
on my mother's front step.

2285
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:04,330
<i>They've tried to destroy me,
there's no question.</i>

2286
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:06,610
<i>They create
anonymous websites about me,</i>

2287
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:09,160
<i>And smear me
with a lot of garbage.</i>

2288
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:11,580
Www.Whoistomdevocht.Com.

2289
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:13,400
<i>Whoispaulhaggis.Com.</i>

2290
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:15,790
"paul haggis,
the hypocrite of hollywood."

2291
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:19,510
"this guy is a sex pervert,"
or "this guy's a drug dealer."

2292
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:21,260
<i>In the meantime,</i>

2293
01:52:21,290 --> 01:52:25,300
<i>Survey carefully
to find out what
he most values and protects.</i>

2294
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:27,520
<i>Immediately draw up
a three-prong program</i>

2295
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:30,250
<i>To threaten it effectively.</i>

2296
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:34,610
I don't value anything
more than monique.

2297
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:38,610
<i>That's why this campaign
ended up on our doorstep.</i>

2298
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:40,450
Was she there?

2299
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:44,450
<i>I knew they had
their goons around.</i>

2300
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:49,540
<i>And then the guy
rolls down in window
and i saw the truck.</i>

2301
01:52:49,570 --> 01:52:51,910
And he starts filming,
and i go,

2302
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:54,110
"okay, this is not good."

2303
01:52:54,130 --> 01:52:55,610
What's goin' on?

2304
01:52:55,630 --> 01:52:57,500
Oh, we're just doing
a documentary.

2305
01:52:57,550 --> 01:52:58,750
A documentary?

2306
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:01,000
Oh, a former
scientology deal.

2307
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:03,170
But it would
probably be a good idea
if y'all went ahead--

2308
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:04,720
Now that you've gotten
what you need,

2309
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:06,300
Go ahead and leave the area.
Sure.

2310
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:08,060
Okay?

2311
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:09,290
<i>I don't know
who these people are.</i>

2312
01:53:09,310 --> 01:53:11,290
<i>I don't know
what they're capable of.</i>

2313
01:53:11,310 --> 01:53:14,630
And now that i have my son...

2314
01:53:14,650 --> 01:53:18,850
<i>I have
a little louisville slugger
i keep next to me.</i>

2315
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:23,270
<i>It's been a nonstop onslaught,
for five years.</i>

2316
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:24,770
I told you to leave.
Get out of here.

2317
01:53:24,810 --> 01:53:26,320
Oh no, i'm leaving.

2318
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:27,780
You can't even
defend yourself
on this can you?

2319
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:29,310
What's your name?

2320
01:53:29,330 --> 01:53:30,780
I gave you my name, marty.
What's your name?

2321
01:53:30,830 --> 01:53:32,500
Marty, i gave you my name.

2322
01:53:32,530 --> 01:53:35,620
<i>The people on marty's doorstep
were sent by scientology</i>

2323
01:53:35,650 --> 01:53:38,150
<i>Because the church
had branded marty a "squirrel,"</i>

2324
01:53:38,170 --> 01:53:40,670
<i>A term invented by hubbard
for former members</i>

2325
01:53:40,710 --> 01:53:42,490
<i>Who threatened
church teachings.</i>

2326
01:53:42,510 --> 01:53:44,160
David miscavige had you
come all the way from...

2327
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:45,460
Marty.
...San jose.

2328
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:48,300
Marty!
Man #2: You can't do that.

2329
01:53:48,330 --> 01:53:49,710
You can't do that, marty!
I just did it.

2330
01:53:49,770 --> 01:53:50,830
No, that's my
personal property, marty.

2331
01:53:50,850 --> 01:53:52,680
Yeah, that's right.

2332
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:54,520
I got arrested, man.

2333
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:57,360
I got arrested for grabbing
this guy's glasses.

2334
01:53:57,390 --> 01:53:59,170
I said, "don't look at her."
you understand that?

2335
01:53:59,190 --> 01:54:01,230
Yeah.
I heard her.

2336
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,730
<i>Of course, the guy had been
stalking monique for two years.</i>

2337
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:05,980
<i>He looks
like a leering pervert,</i>

2338
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:08,650
<i>Like norman bates
from "psycho."</i>

2339
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:11,450
<i>I didn't break his glasses.</i>

2340
01:54:11,490 --> 01:54:15,290
I just removed them
from his-- from his face.

2341
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:23,130
<i>They got it all on videotape
from their surveillance house</i>

2342
01:54:23,170 --> 01:54:26,050
<i>That was filming 24/7, 365,</i>

2343
01:54:26,090 --> 01:54:28,840
<i>For five years,
across the street from us.</i>

2344
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:36,440
<i>This lawsuit
with monique rathbun--</i>

2345
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,810
<i>It's a brilliant
legal strategy.</i>

2346
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:40,880
If marty sues,
the church just says,

2347
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:42,270
"this is
a first amendment fight.

2348
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:43,740
"this should not be
in a court of law."

2349
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:45,320
But monique
was never in scientology.

2350
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:50,110
<i>She's suing david miscavige
and asking to depose him.</i>

2351
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:53,330
<i>And scientology
will do anything to keep him
out of that situation.</i>

2352
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,080
And the point is, judge,

2353
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:57,280
If you let me
make my presentation,

2354
01:54:57,330 --> 01:54:59,170
On first amendment law

2355
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:01,740
That comes from
the united states
supreme court...

2356
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,540
<i>For every court date,</i>

2357
01:55:03,570 --> 01:55:06,370
<i>The church hires a bevy
of high-priced lawyers.</i>

2358
01:55:06,410 --> 01:55:09,380
<i>They are determined
to use every legal trick
in the book</i>

2359
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:11,630
<i>To keep miscavige
from having to testify</i>

2360
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:15,300
<i>About church abuses
or whether the religion
of scientology</i>

2361
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:17,550
<i>Is actually operated
like a business,</i>

2362
01:55:17,590 --> 01:55:21,470
<i>Controlled by the whims
of a single individual.</i>

2363
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:26,280
<i>In 2014,
miscavige celebrated</i>

2364
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:28,450
<i>The ongoing expansion
of the church,</i>

2365
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,700
<i>But he was hiding
a terrible secret.</i>

2366
01:55:30,730 --> 01:55:32,270
Good evening!

2367
01:55:32,290 --> 01:55:34,320
<i> The church's
active membership
has dropped</i>

2368
01:55:34,370 --> 01:55:36,070
<i>To fewer
than 50,000 people,</i>

2369
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:40,270
<i>Yet the financial value
of scientology is soaring.</i>

2370
01:55:40,290 --> 01:55:42,130
How about we just say,

2371
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:47,170
2013 is the year
we went stratospheric?

2372
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:52,170
<i>The church
is making investments</i>

2373
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:54,170
<i>And buying
valuable real estate
all over the world.</i>

2374
01:55:54,220 --> 01:55:58,140
<i>That financial clout
gives scientology
enormous power.</i>

2375
01:55:58,180 --> 01:56:00,460
<i>It's a kind of
tax-free shell company</i>

2376
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:05,350
<i>Growing past $3 billion
in assets.</i>

2377
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:15,810
The church now
no longer has a public face.

2378
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:18,110
<i>There's no spokespeople,</i>

2379
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:20,280
<i>They don't do
media interviews,</i>

2380
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:23,030
<i>And that suits miscavige.</i>

2381
01:56:23,090 --> 01:56:25,290
There is nobody
that he is willing

2382
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:28,160
To have be
the face of scientology
other than himself,

2383
01:56:28,170 --> 01:56:31,680
But he's afraid to
be interviewed by anybody

2384
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:34,380
For fear that they're
gonna ask him questions

2385
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:36,800
That he can't answer,
or doesn't want to answer.

2386
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:41,220
<i>Where are the checks
and balances on his power?</i>

2387
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:42,550
<i>There is none.</i>

2388
01:56:42,610 --> 01:56:44,340
So there are two things
that could happen.

2389
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:48,390
One is, the irs
would reconsider
its tax exemption.

2390
01:56:48,450 --> 01:56:52,730
<i>The only other thing
is that some of these
celebrity megaphones</i>

2391
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:54,980
<i>Could turn
against the church.</i>

2392
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:58,320
<i>And tom cruise
should be leading
that chorus.</i>

2393
01:57:02,290 --> 01:57:05,290
<i>Is there anything
that you look back on,</i>

2394
01:57:05,330 --> 01:57:07,700
<i>In terms of your own career
in the church,</i>

2395
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:10,530
<i>And think, "wow,
i wish i hadn't done that?"</i>

2396
01:57:10,550 --> 01:57:13,720
You know, we talked
about karma earlier.

2397
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:18,340
And, you know,
it still happens that
it's like it's just this--

2398
01:57:18,370 --> 01:57:22,380
I constantly get presented
with who i was,

2399
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:25,100
And, you know,
and i constantly
don't like what i see,

2400
01:57:25,150 --> 01:57:27,680
And i sort of constantly
keep dying deaths.

2401
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:29,600
Um, and--

2402
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:33,720
I don't know how many
more deaths i have left,

2403
01:57:33,740 --> 01:57:36,560
But i-- but i--

2404
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:39,490
But i regret

2405
01:57:39,530 --> 01:57:42,910
And i'm ashamed of, uh...

2406
01:57:44,330 --> 01:57:47,200
The entire experience,
you know?

2407
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:49,420
What i take away from it
is that we--

2408
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:52,370
We lock up a portion
of our own mind.

2409
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:56,680
We-- we willingly
put cuffs on.

2410
01:57:56,710 --> 01:58:00,260
We willingly avoid things

2411
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:03,270
That will--
could cause us pain,

2412
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:06,050
If we just--
if we looked.

2413
01:58:06,110 --> 01:58:08,470
If we can just
believe something,

2414
01:58:08,530 --> 01:58:11,110
Then we don't have to really
think for ourselves, do we?

2415
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:14,600
And so i can't
damn these people
who aren't coming out,

2416
01:58:14,610 --> 01:58:18,780
Or who are hiding
once they come out
because they're ashamed.

2417
01:58:18,820 --> 01:58:20,790
You know, i--

2418
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:23,740
I-- i feel the same shame.

2419
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:27,160
And i just--
i'm fighting back

2420
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:31,580
By communicating, you know?
It's a peaceful protest.

2421
01:58:31,610 --> 01:58:35,500
I want the truth to be known,

2422
01:58:35,550 --> 01:58:37,500
And...

2423
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:40,760
Thank you.

2424
01:58:40,790 --> 01:58:42,490
You're welcome.

2425
