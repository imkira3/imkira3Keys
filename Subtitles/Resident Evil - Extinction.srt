00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,894
Take a sample of her blood...

3
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,231
...and then get rid of that.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,551
<i>The Umbrella Corporation thought
they'd contained the infection.</i>

5
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,010
<i>Well, they were wrong.</i>

6
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,179
<i>Raccoon City was just the beginning.</i>

7
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,142
<i>Within weeks, the T-virus
had consumed the United States.</i>

8
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,310
<i>Within months, the world.</i>

9
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,771
<i>The virus didn't just
wipe out human life.</i>

10
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,941
<i>Lakes and rivers dried up,
forests became deserts...</i>

11
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,026
<i>...and whole continents
were reduced to...</i>

12
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,571
<i>...nothing more than
barren wastelands.</i>

13
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:30,868
<i>Slowly but surely, the Earth
began to wither and die.</i>

14
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,884
<i>What few survivors there were
learned to keep on the move.</i>

15
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,760
<i>We avoided major cities.</i>

16
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,681
<i>If we stopped anyplace too long,
they would be drawn to us.</i>

17
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:56,393
<i>Only a few at first,
but then more and more.</i>

18
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,272
<i>A never-ending army of undead.</i>

19
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,483
<i>For those of us left...</i>

20
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,526
...staying on the road...

21
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,904
<i>...seemed the only way to stay alive.</i>

22
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,752
<i>This is KLKB.
We have seven people here...</i>

23
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,921
<i>...in need of urgent medical attention.</i>

24
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,591
<i>We need help. This is KLKB.
Can anyone hear us?</i>

25
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,344
<i>Can anyone help us? Please?</i>

26
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,122
My baby.

27
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,166
Please.

28
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,793
Please help my baby.

29
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,477
You bitch.

30
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,646
You dropped my baby.

31
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,485
"We're surrounded. We need help.
Can anyone hear us?

32
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,698
- Can anyone help us? Please."
- Works every time, Mama.

33
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,867
Let's see...

34
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,953
...what else she's packing.
- Yeah.

35
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,000
What you got down there, fishy?

36
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,961
I wouldn't do that.

37
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,965
Shut your mouth!

38
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,551
- Relax!
- Just show the bitch.

39
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,892
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

40
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,395
Jesus Christ! He's dead!

41
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,504
Think you're pretty smart, huh?

42
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,214
Well, you'll see.

43
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,760
There you go, bitch.
I wouldn't want it to be over too fast!

44
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,565
Open the cage!

45
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,218
Let them loose.

46
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,869
Get up now!

47
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,205
That was a juicy one, huh?

48
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,976
Hey, Carlos, this is Claire.

49
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,478
- You got any smokes?
- No.

50
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,480
Like I'm supposed to believe that.

51
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,650
Claire, would I lie to you?

52
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,912
- L.J.
- Claire Redfield, how can I help you?

53
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,998
- Got any smokes?
- No can do.

54
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,292
How about alternate?

55
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,378
Sorry to say we're out of that too.

56
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,672
You gotta be shitting me. Otto?

57
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:26,801
Sorry, campers. Smoked the last of it
back in Salt Lake.

58
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,094
Damn.

59
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,930
<i>- Yeah, people...
- Damn it.</i>

60
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,932
<i>...It really is the end of the world.</i>

61
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,550
- Anyone else?
- Paris facility.

62
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,261
Food supplies down to 50 percent.

63
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:14,349
Six casualties.
Biohazard numbers increasing.

64
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,643
London facility.

65
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,271
Food supplies down to 28 percent.
Seventeen casualties.

66
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,857
Biohazard numbers increasing.

67
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,526
Gentlemen.

68
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,403
Dr. lsaacs.

69
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,947
How good of the science division
to join us.

70
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,992
Chairman Wesker. I've been busy.

71
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,912
On the subject of the biohazard,
what is the science division's report?

72
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,917
Well, we now know conclusively that
they have no real need for sustenance.

73
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:45,338
They hunger for flesh
but do not require it.

74
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,092
My research indicates
they could remain active for decades.

75
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,762
We're to be trapped underground
for decades?

76
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,306
What news of Project Alice?

77
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,934
Using antibodies from her blood...

78
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:02,939
...I will develop a serum that will not
just combat the effects of the T-virus...

79
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,650
...but potentially reverse it...

80
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:09,112
...giving back these creatures
a measure of their intelligence...

81
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,409
...their memories,
thus curbing their hunger for flesh.

82
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,037
You're confident you can
domesticate them?

83
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:21,082
They're animals, essentially.

84
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:26,171
We can train them, if we can
take away their baser instincts.

85
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,131
They'll never be human...

86
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:32,093
...but would provide the basis
for a docile workforce.

87
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,803
We can return to the surface.

88
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,473
After months of experiments,
you have nothing to show.

89
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,976
- We are left to rot underground.
- Without the original Project Alice...

90
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,686
...progress has been difficult.

91
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,898
I've been forced to replicate her
using cloned genetic models.

92
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,276
It's laborious.
The results, unpredictable.

93
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:53,156
Project Alice and the subject of
domestication is of the highest priority.

94
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,494
You will concentrate on this to
the exclusion of all other research.

95
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,496
We expect an updated report
in a week.

96
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,999
Simply demanding results
will not guarantee them.

97
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,668
Then perhaps we should place
someone else in charge.

98
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,172
Someone who can give us
the reassurances we require.

99
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,175
Continue with your research, doctor...

100
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,553
...while it still is your research.

101
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,806
This meeting is adjourned.

102
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,697
Sorry about this, Stevie.

103
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,636
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy,
broadcasting for any survivors.</i>

00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,596
<i>ls anybody out there?</i>

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,735
<i>ls anybody out there?</i>

108
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:45,138
This is Claire Redfield's convoy.
Location, the Desert Trail Motel.

109
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,433
Broadcasting for any survivors.
ls there anybody in there?

110
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,729
Broadcasting for any survivors.
ls there anybody in there?

111
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,564
Keep trying, Mike)'

112
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,317
ls there anyone alive in there?

113
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,861
<i>Please respond.</i>

114
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,655
- Seems quiet.
- Yeah, don't they always?

115
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,533
<i>Is there anyone alive in there?
Please respond.</i>

116
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,786
Claire. Looks clear. Shall we go in?

117
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,080
It's your call, boys.

118
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,418
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's do it.

119
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,623
I'm gonna get me a room.

120
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,377
I'll take a waterbed, a Jacuzzi...

121
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,712
...and I'm gonna rent me a porno.

122
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,593
<i>What happened? You two okay?</i>

123
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,262
Yeah. It's all clear.

124
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,776
Somebody need my help?

125
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,696
It's nothing. But if you insist...

126
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,449
That's right. So sit back and relax.

127
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:40,790
Spread out. Look for anything of use.
Gas, food, ammo. You know the drill.

128
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,292
You like playing rough, huh?

129
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,254
- Oh, I've had worse.
- I'm sure.

130
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,465
But you've always been gentle
with me, Betty.

131
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:53,344
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

132
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,641
So, what do we say,
dinner at my place tonight?

133
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,269
Oh, I'm there.

134
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,604
Hey, Betty! Over here!

135
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,362
This is amazing.
He knows what it is.

136
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,244
Camera.

137
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,039
You try.

138
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,590
Stand your ground.

139
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,719
- My God.
- Unbelievable.

140
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,239
He has memory
and reasoning skills.

141
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:41,494
This is incredible. The serum works.
You've domesticated them.

142
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,246
You've done it. Congratulations.

143
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:55,091
No, doctor! Please. No!

144
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,885
No, no, doctor. Please, no!

145
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,695
Pork and beans. I'll get some
peaches for the little one there.

146
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,154
There you go.

147
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,949
- It's asparagus.
- Thanks.

148
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,450
For you

149
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,119
...cat food.

150
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,540
Just kidding. It's pork and beans.

151
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,918
- Hey.
- What's this, huh?

152
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,295
- Soup. Cream of mushroom.
- Bullshit.

153
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,173
- I think that's pork and beans too.
- Thanks, man.

154
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,134
- I'll be damned.
- Asparagus.

155
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,428
- How do you do that?
- Just one of my skills.

156
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,514
It's a dying art, unfortunately.

157
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,641
This is the last of it.

158
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,644
- I think it's some kind of fruit.
- Thanks, Otto.

159
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,980
Sorry, that's all we have.

160
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,441
Fruit. You want some fruit?

161
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,609
Fruit. You want some fruit?

162
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:07,163
- Did you check out the gas station?
- Yep, it's bone-dry.

163
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,624
Well, how we looking here?

164
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,503
Well, Claire, if we can run
these trucks on rust...

165
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,505
...we're looking pretty good.

166
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,257
All right.

167
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,722
Hey, sweetheart.

168
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:26,265
Perimeter up yet?

169
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,434
It's almost done.

170
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,312
- Who's out there?
- Olivera.

171
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,650
- Hey, Carlos.
- Claire.

172
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:40,029
<i>All that smoking is slowing you down.
Get your ass in gear, old man.</i>

173
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,531
I want my perimeter up.

174
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,424
Last sentinel in place.

175
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:05,179
Perimeter's up and running.
All motion sensors online.

176
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,723
Cameras 100 percent.

177
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,814
Refried beans. Fruit salad.

178
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,732
Oh, my favorite.

179
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,235
Storm's coming!

180
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,530
Let's start packing it up
and move it inside.

181
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,366
- Come on, kids, let's go!
- Hurry up!

182
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,494
Get back in the bus.
Put this fire out.

183
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:08,242
This is Claire Redfield's convoy.
Location, the Desert Trail Motel.

184
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:12,705
<i>Lat. 35, long. 114.
Calling any survivors.</i>

185
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,711
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy.
Location, the Desert Trail Motel.</i>

186
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,715
<i>Lat. 35, long. 114.
Calling any survivors.</i>

187
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,866
Activate Number 87.

188
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,908
Shit.

189
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,036
- Dr. lsaacs.
- What is it?

190
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,997
My sensors have detected a peak
in psionic activity.

191
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,249
Both alpha and beta wave.

192
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:03,792
From Number 87?

193
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,378
No, the activity's not from
one of the clones.

194
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,131
It occurred outside the complex.

195
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:13,135
- That's not possible.
- My sensors were quite clear.

196
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:17,973
Massive psionic activity was detected
15 minutes ago...

197
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,809
...centered on a desert location.

198
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,749
- Claire!
- What?

199
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,065
What the hell?

200
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,776
Oh, God.

201
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,622
- Carlos.
- I see them.

202
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,792
Everybody stay in your trucks.

203
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,921
What's going on?

204
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,548
<i>Everyone just stay in your trucks.</i>

205
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,134
Roll up the windows and keep quiet.

206
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,261
Okay, close the windows up.

207
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,491
What's wrong with their eyes?

208
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,453
They've been feeding
on infected flesh.

209
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,849
- Fire it up. Let's get out of here.
- That's a hell of an idea.

210
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,518
Lock and load.

211
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:58,110
- We're stuck!
- Hell, no, let's get out of here.

212
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,825
Let's head for the bus, come on.

213
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:13,166
Come on! Go! Go!

214
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,544
Come on, get in!
Come on, come on, come on.

215
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,349
Claire!

216
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,686
Damn it.

217
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,980
Mikey, Carlos,
we have to evac the bus.

218
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,733
You got it.

219
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,737
Hold it!

220
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:05,093
- Come on, move!
- Keep moving!

221
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,610
Come on! Go! Go! Go! Come on!

222
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,945
"Betty!
'Go! Just go!

223
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,418
Get out of here, Betty! Go!

224
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:41,421
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go!

225
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,844
- Betty! Betty!
- L.J., hurry up!

226
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,264
Come with me!

227
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,491
Come on! Come on! Betty! Betty!

228
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,744
No!

229
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,167
Betty!

230
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,012
Go! Go! Go!

231
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,405
Dr. lsaacs.

232
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,908
Another spike in alpha
and beta waves detected.

233
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:37,329
Forty-five percent probability
that this is Project Alice.

234
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:40,248
Triangulate. Find her location.

235
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,338
Impressive.

236
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:49,216
If it is her, her development
is extraordinary.

237
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:52,135
Her powers would appear to have
grown at a geometric rate...

238
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:55,430
...since her escape from
the Detroit facility.

239
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:02,187
You've made 10 trips to the surface
in the past 24 hours. All unauthorized.

240
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:06,691
Any trip to the surface, especially to
gather specimens, puts my men at risk.

241
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,902
Why do you need so many
all of a sudden?

242
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:10,904
Isaacs!

243
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,448
My research has intensified.

244
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,956
Don't worry.
They're perfectly secure.

245
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,587
You're supposed to be
domesticating them.

246
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:29,798
Sometimes aggression has its uses.

247
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,384
What could you possibly need
these things for?

248
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:33,885
Dr. lsaacs.

249
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,722
Specimen 87 has reached
the final stage of the test grid.

250
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,433
Perfect. Put her on the screen.

251
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,023
Good girl.

252
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,325
Is Chairman Wesker
even aware of this?

253
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,953
He knows what he needs to know.

254
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,497
You've overstepped your mark.

255
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,418
My research will change
the face of everything.

256
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:10,130
If you pick a side...

257
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,592
...be sure it's the right one.

258
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:36,865
Hi.

259
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,867
H9)'-

260
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,956
This belong to you?

261
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,834
I gave it to you last night.

262
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:50,378
For luck.

263
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:52,589
Thank you.

264
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:54,883
What's your name?

265
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:57,052
K-Mart.

266
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,721
It's where they found me.

267
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:02,015
Claire and the other...

268
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:03,683
A few years back.

269
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:07,562
Do you have another name?

270
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,731
Never liked it.

271
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,903
Everyone I knew was dead...

272
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,406
...so seemed like time for a change.

273
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,834
Anyone want to say something?

274
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,195
Alice, this is Claire Redfield.

275
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:00,448
She's the one who put this
convoy together.

276
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,283
Thank you so much for your help.

277
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,119
Claire!

278
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,332
Excuse me. I have things
I have to attend to.

279
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,091
In the last six months,
she lost half of the convoy.

280
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:22,137
Pretty soon there'll be
more of us dead than alive.

281
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,890
Alice, what happened to you?

282
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,476
Why did you leave after Detroit?

283
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:32,647
I didn't have a choice.
They were using me.

284
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,567
What do you mean?

285
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,485
They were tracking me.

286
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,738
I couldn't be around you.
Any of you.

287
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:44,117
- I would've gotten you all killed.
- That's why you disappeared?

288
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:48,329
Broke into an Umbrella facility
and hacked into their computers...

289
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:51,249
...downloaded the satellite
trajectories...

290
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,501
...and stayed off the grid.

291
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:55,712
And after the world ended?

292
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:58,381
Why stay out there alone?

293
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:04,137
It's just safer
if I'm not around people.

294
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,765
Why'd you come back?

295
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,291
Damn!

296
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,294
What time is it?

297
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,546
Chase, what time is it?

298
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:45,386
Well, Carlos, it is 12:14. Why?
You got somewhere you gotta be?

299
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,681
Guess I'm just being paranoid.

300
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,608
Welcome home.

301
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,327
Got a minute?

302
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:11,037
Yeah.

303
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,748
Everyone is grateful
for you helping us out.

304
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:16,417
But how long am I gonna stay?

305
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,628
Don't get me wrong.

306
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,422
We really are grateful.

307
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:27,762
They're all talking about what you did.
And they're scared.

308
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,889
I don't blame them.

309
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:34,811
People have a habit
of dying around me.

310
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,438
Not just you.

311
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,074
<i>You're positive it's her?</i>

312
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:52,745
Sixty-two percent.
Too great a chance to pass up.

313
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:57,417
If it is Project Alice, she's been
evading the satellite grid for years.

314
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,627
I've re-routed
the remaining satellites.

315
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,755
We can reacquire the subject.
She'll be unaware of surveillance.

316
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:05,174
I can have a strike team ready
within the hour.

317
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:09,596
No. We'll establish
a positive identification first.

318
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,472
One hundred percent.

319
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,809
The group she's with
include known associates.

320
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:18,563
The original Project Alice
is vital to my research...

321
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,357
...to the whole process
of domestication. Her blood...

322
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,818
...her genetic structure, is the key.

323
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:26,821
The longer she's out there,
the greater chance we lose her.

324
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,949
- I can't risk that.
- That decision isn't yours to make.

325
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:33,953
Take no action until this matter has
been discussed by the committee...

326
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,457
...at the next scheduled meeting.
And, doctor...

327
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:38,750
...that's an order.

328
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:47,008
These transmissions are the best
indication of life we've seen in months.

329
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,135
- Alaska?
- We have to check it out.

330
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:50,720
We can't just ignore it.

331
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:52,931
Any idea what kind
of journey that would be?

332
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,184
- Yeah. A long one.
- And at the end of it, what?

333
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:59,062
You have no guarantee there's even
anyone alive up there.

334
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:02,774
- These transmissions say that--
- They're dated six months ago.

335
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:05,360
How many radio broadcasts
have we responded to?

336
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:08,821
How many times
have we got there too late?

337
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,825
The transmissions say that
there's no infection up there.

338
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,535
It's isolated.

339
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,037
Safe.

340
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:19,791
This convoy trusts me
with their lives.

341
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,001
These people don't need
pipe dreams.

342
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,545
Maybe that's exactly what they need.

343
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:26,714
Look at them, Claire.

344
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:32,053
Six months ago, there were 50 of us,
then 40, now there's less than 30.

345
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,556
They're starting to give up.

346
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,476
They need some kind of hope.

347
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:48,444
We have a decision to make.

348
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:52,824
And it's too big, it's too important
for me to make for you.

349
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,411
There's a chance
there are survivors.

350
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:57,954
Where?

351
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,081
In Alaska.

352
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,459
There is a chance...

353
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,754
...that the infection
hasn't reached that far.

354
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,215
But we don't know for sure.

355
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,259
So we have a choice.

356
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,428
We stay as we are...

357
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:16,264
...or we try for Alaska.

358
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,518
For Alaska.

359
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,192
Alaska.

360
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,122
I hope you're right.

361
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,970
God.

362
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:12,945
The food's virtually gone
and the truck's running on empty.

363
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:15,406
I've got half a tank of gas. That's it.

364
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,326
- Chase?
- Shit, I don't even have empty.

365
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,829
I got enough for
a hundred miles, tops.

366
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,749
If we're gonna make this trip,
we'll need to resupply.

367
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,417
Yep.

368
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,253
These are our options.

369
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:33,174
The nearest, safest bet
is right there.

370
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:36,094
No, it's empty. I tried that.

371
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,097
Then, well, maybe...

372
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,974
- We could try this--
- Vegas.

373
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,645
It's the only place we're sure to find
gas and supplies.

374
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:48,356
There's a reason for that.
Vegas is too dangerous.

375
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:50,191
It's crawling with them
sons of bitches.

376
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:53,361
We've drained every small town dry
over the last six months.

377
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,947
We have to hit a big city.

378
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,865
She's right.

379
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,535
Vegas, it's our only bet.

380
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:11,337
<i>We'll establish
a positive identification.</i>

381
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:12,880
<i>One hundred percent.</i>

382
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:18,177
<i>Take no action until this matter has
been discussed by the committee.</i>

383
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,221
<i>Doctor...</i>

384
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,557
...that's an order.

385
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:36,070
<i>The committee authorizes
immediate action.</i>

386
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:39,240
<i>Release of vehicles
and personnel...</i>

387
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,743
<i>...under command of Dr. lsaacs.</i>

388
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,079
<i>That's an order.</i>

389
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,587
Hey. You all right?

390
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,631
Yeah, I'm fine.

391
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:22,927
Them pork and beans, they lethal.
I don't see how you cowboys do it.

392
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,180
Years of practice.

393
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,777
Oh, my God.

394
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:14,854
What happened to it?

395
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,690
The desert must have taken it back.

396
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:19,775
Five years.

397
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,236
No one to keep the sand back.

398
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,746
It's empty-

399
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,372
No undead.

400
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,875
Nothing.

401
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:39,795
Those birds must have moved
through the city block by block.

402
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,089
Picked it clean.

403
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,600
I don't see any truck stops.

404
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:55,186
Where are they?

405
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:56,896
There.

406
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,774
Valet parking at the casino
up ahead.

407
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,776
There's gas pumps in there.

408
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,694
Now, how do you know that?

409
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,780
I dropped two G's
back in the day here.

410
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,115
You lost $2000?

411
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,050
Damn it.

412
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:40,064
Spread them out!

413
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,485
We're gonna have to move it.

414
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:00,835
All right, Chase, I need a lookout!

415
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:03,003
Up there.

416
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,556
Great.

417
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:28,154
Climb the Eiffel Tower
with a high-powered rifle.

418
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:31,365
A few years ago,
that would've caused a stir.

419
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:37,371
Well, let the good times roll.

420
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,225
Let's get this done.

421
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,187
Get the hell out of here.
Mikey, get the winch.

422
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:02,813
- Yeah.
- Carlos.

423
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,844
Wait.

424
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,603
Get back!

425
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:13,133
- Carlos, cover me!
- Go!

426
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:05,894
Move!

427
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:37,676
Just get to the back and stay quiet.
Go! Now! Go!

428
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:41,472
Get down!

429
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:58,424
She really is magnificent.

430
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:03,053
When she's dead,
make sure you move in fast.

431
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,973
I need a sample of her blood
while it's still warm.

432
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,267
That won't be a problem.

433
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:13,063
- Satellite in position?
- Yes, sir.

434
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:16,150
Then shut her down.

435
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,774
Mikey!

436
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:03,447
Hey!

437
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:23,383
Mikey!

438
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:27,971
No!

439
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:30,724
No!

440
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:01,380
She's fighting the conditioning.

441
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:02,923
Boost the control signal.

442
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:11,723
Shit!

443
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,560
Climb! Give me your hand!

444
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:24,152
Run! Go!

445
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,446
Go! Run!

446
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,407
Let's go!

447
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:42,796
L.J.!

448
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:48,218
L.J.

449
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:17,831
What is it?

450
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:20,334
Satellite. Some kind of malfunction.

451
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:49,863
HOW long?

452
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:53,700
New feed coming online
in 15 seconds.

453
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,999
Online in three, two...

454
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,293
Now.

455
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:08,090
Where the hell is she going?

456
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:12,636
Shut her down!

457
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,518
She's still coming!

458
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:23,146
- Now!
- Oh, shit.

459
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:29,820
You son of a--

460
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,448
Back to base!

461
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:42,416
The anti-virus!
Get me the anti-virus!

462
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:00,892
Why didn't you shoot?

463
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:04,855
Because we're not driving to Alaska.
I want that helicopter intact.

464
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:08,400
Let's go look at the computer,
see where that chopper's headed.

465
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:24,332
- How is he?
- Under house arrest...

466
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:27,044
...as you instructed.
He's been quiet.

467
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:43,810
How much of this have you used?

468
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,229
Her blood increased
the creatures' power.

469
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,858
It also increased the strength
of the infection.

470
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,946
I needed it.

471
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,075
You have no idea
what this will do to you.

472
01:08:01,495 --> 01:08:04,998
Oh, I have an idea.

473
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,834
You're out of control.

474
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:10,003
Well, this ends here.

475
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,964
Under executive order 1345,
issued by Chairman Wesker...

476
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:15,342
...for gross misconduct in the field...

477
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,928
...I sentence you to
summary liquidation.

478
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,013
Liquidation?

479
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:23,100
Just die.

480
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:34,986
Take the body to the surface.
Bring me the stats on Program Alice--

481
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:36,613
Sir!

482
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,014
Good thing we like a challenge.

483
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:23,076
Hold on.

484
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,328
Hold on.

485
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,790
They have the anti-virus in there.

486
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:30,709
Just hold on.

487
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:33,545
It's too late, and you know it.

488
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:39,259
Besides, you need a way
to get in there.

489
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:41,511
And I have an idea.

490
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:58,236
- You keep them safe, huh?
- You got it.

491
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:06,453
Come here.

492
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:25,472
Carlos, I--

493
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,557
Save it.

494
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:35,315
You just promise me one thing.

495
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,318
When you get down there...

496
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:41,404
Consider it done.

497
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,717
Wish I had a smoke.

498
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,076
Fuck!

499
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:26,301
I'll be damned.

500
01:12:26,468 --> 01:12:29,304
L.J., you sneaky son of a bitch.

501
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:38,104
Oh, hell.

502
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,151
Come on.

503
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,828
Get the kids out quickly!

504
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,454
Go!

505
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:42,627
- Run! Run! Hurry up!
- Okay.

506
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,003
Go! Go! Go!

507
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,715
Take him!

508
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,681
You're not coming?

509
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,517
Take care of the others.

510
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,724
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

511
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:28,895
- I am the artificial intelligence--
- I know what you are.

512
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,730
I knew your sister.

513
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:32,899
She was a homicidal bitch.

514
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:36,235
My sister computer was merely
following the most logical path...

515
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,237
for the preservation of human life

516
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:40,573
Yeah. Kill a few, save a lot.

517
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:42,867
So, what happened here?

518
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:46,829
Dr. lsaacs returned in an infected
state. He was bitten by a creature...

519
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:49,666
...that had been treated
with a newly developed serum.

520
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:52,085
A serum derived from your blood.

521
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,838
The resulting infection
has caused massive mutation.

522
01:17:58,925 --> 01:17:59,926
My blood?

523
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:02,011
Your blood has bonded
with the T-virus.

524
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,763
Dr. lsaacs correctly deduced...

525
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,850
...that it could be used
to destroy the biohazard for good.

526
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:11,437
You mean my blood
is the cure for all this?

527
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,106
Correct.

528
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,441
So why are you helping me?

529
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:18,611
Your blood is pure,
and this facility contains...

530
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:22,073
...all of the equipment you will require
to synthesize a cure.

531
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:27,787
- You mean this could all end?
- Correct.

532
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:29,414
There is, however...

533
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,291
...a small problem.

534
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:40,925
<i>I have him contained
in the lower levels. ..</i>

535
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:43,845
<i>...But I cannot hold him there
for much longer.</i>

536
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:47,974
All right, let's go.

537
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:01,070
<i>Alice ?</i>

538
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:03,322
<i>Good luck.</i>

539
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:12,488
You can't kill me.

540
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:02,288
I've told you...

541
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,915
...I can't die.

542
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,314
No.

543
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:55,841
For so long, I thought
you were the future.

544
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,177
I was wrong.

545
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,347
I am the future.

546
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,313
No.

547
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:11,899
You're just...

548
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:14,068
...another asshole.

549
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:19,365
And we're both gonna die
down here.

550
01:25:41,554 --> 01:25:43,889
Yeah, you're the future, all right.

551
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:23,053
All attempts to contact the North
American facility continue to fail.

552
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:25,347
How long have they been off the air?

553
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:27,474
Seventeen hours.

554
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:31,061
We must consider them lost.
But our plans remain unchanged.

555
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:33,439
All data will be transferred
to this facility...

556
01:26:33,606 --> 01:26:37,067
...and the research will continue
under my personal supervision.

557
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:39,737
I expect results within one month.

558
01:26:39,904 --> 01:26:41,906
You won't have to wait that long, boys.

559
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:44,283
Because I'm coming for you.

560
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:45,701
And...

561
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:48,954
...I'm gonna be bringing
a few of my friends.

562
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:53,211
<i>You're just...</i>

563
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:55,714
<i>another asshole</i>
