00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:07,982
- When I was a little girl,
my mother used to tell

2
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:10,751
me story about a princess
who lived on a beautiful

3
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:13,587
island surrounded
by turquoise waters

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,122
where the sky kissed the sea.

5
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:18,324
When the princess
met her prince,

6
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:20,927
their love grew stronger
than the waves crashing

7
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,994
against the shore.

8
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:27,097
So when I met Jack
one day on the beach,

9
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:30,434
he was everything I
had been searching for.

10
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:33,269
I thought it was fate.

11
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:37,173
But I had forgotten
something very important.

12
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:41,276
Every fairy tale has a monster.

13
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:46,347
In my life story, the monster's
name was Gan Cerrancurie.

14
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:49,317
A man whom I later
found out was a ruthless

15
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:51,218
crime lord.

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,122
Little did I know, our path's
were destined to collide.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,074

(gun shot)

19
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:21,309
(gun shots)

20
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:41,827
- Now, a little Birdy
told me you're very bitter

21
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,898
about land deals that
happened between our families.

22
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,400
Where supposedly my
family got land that

23
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:51,334
belongs to you.

24
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:53,103
You have to understand,

25
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:55,438
that wasn't me.

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,875
- I should have squashed
you a long time ago,

27
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:01,710
when I had a chance.

28
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:03,278
- Let's bury the hatchet.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,746
- No.

30
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:09,316
In Cambodia, there is not
enough room for the both of us.

31
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,686
- That means one
of us has to die.

32
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:16,656
- We will leave it to fate.

33
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:19,692
(groaning)

34
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,563
- You were always a cheat.

35
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:28,132
- In matters of life and death,

36
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:30,768
there is no cheating.

37
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,770
Just living and dying.

38
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,204
- Who's choice of weapons.

39
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,439
- High sword.

40
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:38,974
Winner take all.

41
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,076
- Well that puts me
at a disadvantage

42
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,780
because you're a master of
the knives and the swords.

43
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:47,748
Maybe I'll survive.

44
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,618
Maybe I will get lucky.

45
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,319
Maybe not.

46
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:02,161
(swords clanging)

47
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,973
(swords clanging)

48
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:34,887
(groaning)

49
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:44,196
You're out of practice,
my old friend.

50
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:46,864
I expected more from you.

51
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,735
(groaning)

52
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:36,756
Gentlemen, mysteriously
our competitors are gone.

53
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:40,258
You all have done a great job.

54
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,962
I just want to say that
violence is the last resort

55
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:47,098
because it attracts
a lot of attention,

56
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,667
but when we have no choice,
we're pretty good at it.

57
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:52,102
(speaking a foreign language)

58
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:03,244
Good job.

59
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:05,179
Celebrate.

60
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:30,134
- Ok, Sam.

61
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,169
Bank's around the corner,
man, are you ready?

62
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:34,003
- I know what time it is, Jack.

63
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:36,372
- Just try not to shoot me
with that thing, ok pal?

64
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:40,308
Jesus Christ.

65
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:43,111
- Hold on.

66
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:44,912
- Can we go now?

67
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:46,247
- Let's go.

68
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:47,448
- Everybody freeze.

69
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,582
If you don't speak English.

70
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:49,783
(gun shots)

71
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,017
- Don't even think about it.

72
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,018
Down.

73
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,120
(speaking a foreign language)

74
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,321
- Cooperate with us
and nobody gets hurt.

75
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:56,655
You, manager.

76
00:06:56,657 --> 00:07:00,325
Open, open, open, out, out, out.

77
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:04,362
- One minute.

78
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:06,130
- Come on, man.

79
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:09,232
Go, go, go, go.

80
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:16,705
- Keep down.

81
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,343
Move.

82
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:25,947
- Ok, we're good,
get out of here.

83
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,981
- A minute forty five, go.

84
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:29,116
(gun shot)

85
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:30,217
You (speaking in a
foreign language)

86
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,219
- Come on, man.

87
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:45,179
- Holy shit.

88
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,513
What do they do with
all this US currency?

89
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:48,916
I mean, this is like a
crazy amount of money.

90
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:50,516
- How much money do
you think that is?

91
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:51,551
- I haven't got a clue,

92
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:53,186
I've been busy.

93
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:54,187
- What would a small
bank in Cambodia

94
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:55,722
have this much cash, man?

95
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:57,055
- Stop complaining,
we scored, mate.

96
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:58,523
We scored.

97
00:08:58,525 --> 00:08:59,224
- I'm not complaining,
what if they check the bags

98
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:00,459
on the border?

99
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:02,760
- Trust me, they won't.

100
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:05,930
- Good thing, I brought this.

101
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:07,398
- Great.

102
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,232
You expect us to
tape this amount

103
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:10,867
of cash to our bodies?

104
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:12,602
- Tough guy like you
scared of some tape?

105
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:14,271
- It's not the taping
I'm worried about.

106
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:16,438
It's taking it off, my son.

107
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,040
Taking it off.

108
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,141
- You're a harry bastard, man.

109
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,276
It'll do you some good.

110
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,379
- Jesus Christ.

111
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:29,216
You're always trying
to call that chick.

112
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:31,118
You need to get a life, mate.

113
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,785
- She is my life, man.

114
00:09:32,787 --> 00:09:34,086
- You're so whipped.

115
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:35,721
Is that why you're doing this?

116
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:37,156
- Maybe.

117
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:38,657
What's it to you?

118
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:40,892
- It just makes me nervous
working with such a pussy.

119
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:42,727
- Whatever, man.

120
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,296
Let's get you taped up.

121
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:46,163
- No, no, no, after you, mate.

122
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:47,464
Turn around and bend over.

123
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:49,099
- Get off of me, you fucker.

124
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:50,234
This is serious.

125
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:52,468
Just fucking tape me.

126
00:09:56,774 --> 00:10:00,309
(tense music)

127
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:51,517
Thank you.

128
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,252
- Thank you kindly.

129
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,285
(slow serene music)

130
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:41,926
- Hey, baby.

131
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:43,161
- Hey you.

132
00:11:43,163 --> 00:11:45,396
- Want to do me a favor
and ditch that thing?

133
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:47,698
- I just started work.

134
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,767
- You just finished work.

135
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,267
Believe me.

136
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:00,175
- [Girl] My mother
died when I was young

137
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,877
but she taught me not to
take shortcuts in life.

138
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,112
When I got older, I
didn't go for the quick

139
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:08,381
cash in go-go bars like
some other girls I knew.

140
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:11,217
Jack and I were working
towards our dream

141
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:13,453
so that some day we
can live on a beautiful

142
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:16,088
island together.

143
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:23,895
Can I open my eyes yet?

144
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:26,030
- No, not yet.

145
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:27,597
I'll tell you when it's ok.

146
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:43,545
Ok.

147
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:45,279
Open them.

148
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:47,314
(gasp)

149
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,851
- It's the one that I saw from
the store window last week.

150
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:56,055
I love it.

151
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,989
Really, I do.

152
00:12:57,991 --> 00:13:00,225
But honey, we can't afford this.

153
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:03,127
- That's the surprise part.

154
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:04,962
Come here.

155
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:06,297
Let me show you something.

156
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:07,932
Come on, baby.

157
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:10,033
Come on.

158
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,836
Look.

159
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:13,603
- Oh my god.

160
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,237
What is that?

161
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,772
- That is why you
don't have to work

162
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:18,674
at the club anymore, Avalon.

163
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:20,975
And it's all yours.

164
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,078
- I don't understand.

165
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,446
Where did you get it?

166
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:27,113
- Don't ask me where or how

167
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:29,316
or why.

168
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:32,085
I'll tell you why.

169
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:35,154
It's because I love you.

170
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:37,857
I want you to stick around.

171
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,291
- I'm not going anywhere.

172
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:41,493
I love you.

173
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:43,595
Don't you know that?

174
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:44,528
You have to tell
me where you got

175
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,697
all this money.

176
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:48,131
- Avalon, honey, I'm serious.

177
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:50,100
It's better that
you just don't know.

178
00:13:50,102 --> 00:13:53,970
- So, how do I explain
where I got it?

179
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:57,539
- You can't explain
this to anybody, ok?

180
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,041
Now, honey, I'm not
telling you what to do,

181
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:02,610
but we can't spend this
money right now, ok?

182
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:04,979
Maybe we can have a little fun,

183
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:07,181
but I'm going to put most
of it away somewhere safe.

184
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:09,983
- You're crazy, you know that?

185
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:13,286
- I'm crazy for you.

186
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,055
- You know what we should do?

187
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,190
- What?

188
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,291
- We should go on holiday.

189
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,893
To an island.

190
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,728
Like where we met.

191
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,730
- Anything you want, baby doll.

192
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,368
I'm going to go clean up, ok?

193
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,969
I'll be right back.

194
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:35,404
Don't go anywhere.

195
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,441
(sighing)

196
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:13,102
- I think you've
been naughty, Jack.

197
00:15:13,104 --> 00:15:15,604
- Oh yeah?

198
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:17,673
Is it naughty time?

199
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:20,541
Woah, woah, baby
that's not a toy.

200
00:15:20,543 --> 00:15:23,177
- You didn't tell me
you had a gun, Jack.

201
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:24,011
- It slipped my mind.

202
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:25,212
Don't point that.

203
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:26,947
- Don't worry so much.

204
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:29,049
The safety is on.

205
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:32,251
Come here.

206
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:36,355
Why don't you...

207
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:42,827
Do me on all of this cash.

208
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:49,166
Don't me ask you twice, Jack.

209
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:54,570
(giggling)

210
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:56,871
- Yes, ma'am.

211
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:01,009
(giggling)

212
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:13,720
- What kind of flower is that?

213
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:17,923
- This is called a (speaking
a foreign language),

214
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:20,424
it's known as the
rose of compassion.

215
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:22,159
It's a climbing tea rose,

216
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:24,161
kind of common but
I've always loved it.

217
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:26,429
My momma used to grow
these in America.

218
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:28,264
- Do you miss America?

219
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:30,066
- This is my home.

220
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:32,501
I came to Asia
quite a while back

221
00:16:32,503 --> 00:16:35,137
and fell in love
with this place.

222
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:37,840
Just something I
believe in here.

223
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,648
- The bank with your
money was robbed.

224
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,282
They got away with about
200,000 US dollars.

225
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:53,019
Most of it was yours.

226
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:54,487
- Can I ask you a question?

227
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,021
Aren't you the mother
fucker that told me

228
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:58,757
that that's the safest
place to put my money?

229
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,358
- Yes, sir.

230
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,326
- You said it would be safe.

231
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:05,095
You know, I took your advice.

232
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:10,133
So if I were you, I
would get my money back.

233
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:11,634
- It shouldn't be difficult.

234
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:12,869
It was marked.

235
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:14,202
- I don't want to
hear any stories about

236
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:16,204
how easy it's going to be.

237
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:19,141
I want to hear that
we got it back.

238
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:20,441
I want results or I'll
take these fucking

239
00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:22,543
rose clippers and bury
them into somebody's

240
00:17:22,545 --> 00:17:25,146
mother fucking eye.

241
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:27,247
- Yes, sir.

242
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,389
- Yeah, yeah.

243
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:19,157
Seriously, next time
you can't come in

244
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:20,725
shooting the place
up like that, man.

245
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:22,660
No need, it's too much.

246
00:18:22,662 --> 00:18:25,763
- You're thinking
about doing it again?

247
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:29,032
- Thinking about it.

248
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,201
- I'm up for another
run across the border.

249
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:33,035
- Yeah.

250
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:34,069
We were good right?

251
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,205
- Fuck yeah.

252
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:38,372
- I guess all those video
games finally paid off.

253
00:18:38,374 --> 00:18:40,174
- I'm all about the money, baby.

254
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:41,709
- Big time.

255
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:43,411
Especially after taking
so much shit for so long.

256
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,412
It's nice to have
some real cash.

257
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:48,248
- I'm going to buy myself
a new set of wheels.

258
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,683
- Woah, woah, woah.

259
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:51,016
Don't do anything crazy, Sam.

260
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:52,118
We've got to let
that money cool off

261
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,352
for a little while.

262
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:54,620
- A man's got to have
some fun you know.

263
00:18:54,622 --> 00:18:56,287
- I'm just saying,
don't be stupid.

264
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:58,857
- Be careful who
you're calling stupid.

265
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:04,194
- Just looking out
for both of us, man.

266
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:05,596
All right, go have some fun.

267
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:07,197
Just don't go crazy.

268
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:09,298
All right?

269
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,800
I've got lunch.

270
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:12,235
I've got to split, see you, pal.

271
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:14,136
- See you later.

272
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:31,284
- Yeah.

273
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:32,885
Sam told me about this place.

274
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:35,287
It's not too bad, right?

275
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:37,955
- Oh my gosh, this
place is amazing.

276
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,157
- You deserve
nothing less, babe.

277
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,124
- Thank you.

278
00:19:40,126 --> 00:19:41,759
- Thank you.

279
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:42,560
Cheers.

280
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:44,494
- Cheers.

281
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:52,201
- Oh wow.

282
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:54,136
Baby, some of the cash
we're going to have

283
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:55,771
to start putting in
your bank account.

284
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:57,839
No more than a few
thousand dollars at a time.

285
00:19:57,841 --> 00:19:58,807
Ok?

286
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:00,074
- Well, honey, what about you?

287
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:02,276
I want you to have
some of this money too.

288
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:03,911
- Don't worry about me.

289
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:06,180
I took a little off
the top for expenses.

290
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,614
Now if you want to take me
out to dinner a few times,

291
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:12,251
or go on vacation,
I won't stop you.

292
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:16,721
- Jack?

293
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:22,092
We're not in any danger
because of this are we?

294
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:26,529
- No, babe.

295
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:31,134
Avalon, you're safe with me, ok?

296
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:33,969
Swear to God, I'll
do anything I have to

297
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:35,838
to make sure you're
taken care of.

298
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,439
I promise.

299
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:44,878
- [Avalon] I know that Jack
only wanted the best for me,

300
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,881
but there are always
consequences for our actions.

301
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:14,202
(whistling)

302
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:28,081
(breathing heavily)

303
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:33,886
- Hello, Jack.

304
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:35,921
One of my two (speaking
foreign language).

305
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:38,189
- Who the fuck are you?

306
00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:41,192
- My name is Neeron Mortima.

307
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:44,895
I'm your new best friend.

308
00:21:45,898 --> 00:21:47,664
- That's ok, pal.

309
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,532
I don't like the friends I have.

310
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:51,834
I don't need another one.

311
00:21:51,836 --> 00:21:54,169
- Really?

312
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,073
That's funny.

313
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:03,110
(groaning)

314
00:22:07,882 --> 00:22:10,082
Because the way I see it,

315
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:12,118
you could use one
right about now.

316
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:17,756
- What are you, a cop?

317
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:20,090
- There you go,
calling me names.

318
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,195
(groaning)

319
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:28,264
Hold on to that.

320
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:34,703
That was a lot of
money you took from the

321
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:36,972
bank in Cambodia.

322
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:40,074
Especially for
such a small town.

323
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:44,277
And all of that US currency.

324
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,181
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

325
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,582
- The butter.

326
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:52,318
Is it helping?

327
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
- Yeah, actually it
does help a little.

328
00:22:58,158 --> 00:23:02,259
- I am getting really mad
now with this bullshit.

329
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:07,331
The money, asshole.

330
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:14,536
I found it in the closet.

331
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:17,872
- How'd you find me?

332
00:23:19,176 --> 00:23:20,774
- It's all marked and you were

333
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,477
so eager to exchange
it that it showed

334
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:26,145
up on my radar real quick.

335
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:28,181
Now...

336
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:31,417
This is how it's going to work.

337
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:33,318
I'm going to give you
the names of the banks

338
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,655
in Cambodia that you
are going to rob.

339
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:43,160
You're going to do
exactly as I tell you.

340
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:45,762
- Come again?

341
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:47,931
- The banks will be
guaranteed to have

342
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:50,499
just as much if not
more than what you

343
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:52,901
took from the first heist.

344
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:58,840
For my service, I get 50
percent of everything.

345
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:02,175
And unfortunately for you today,

346
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:04,978
you and your partner have
already split the money.

347
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,381
And while you were out,
I took my 50 percent.

348
00:24:08,383 --> 00:24:10,883
That kind of wipes you out.

349
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,491
- I'm not doing this.

350
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:20,958
- Of course.

351
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,494
I knew you were
going to say that.

352
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,595
So here's the other option.

353
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,900
You played a dangerous
game and the rules

354
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,334
have changed.

355
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:34,036
- Wait, wait, ok wait.

356
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:35,871
- No, you know what?

357
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:38,406
I think I'll just talk to
your boyfriend and maybe

358
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:42,009
he will recognize the
generosity of my terms.

359
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:44,210
(muffled speaking)

360
00:24:44,212 --> 00:24:46,713
What?

361
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:49,882
I'm sorry, you want
to say something?

362
00:24:49,884 --> 00:24:52,418
- I'll do it.

363
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,319
I'll do it.

364
00:24:56,723 --> 00:24:58,389
- See Jack?

365
00:24:58,391 --> 00:25:00,925
Best friends.

366
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:04,861
I have a little
something for you.

367
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:07,097
Keep it close.

368
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:09,598
I'll be calling.

369
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:14,035
But just in case.

370
00:25:14,037 --> 00:25:15,937
Your girlfriend,

371
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:18,006
well I am sure that she's
going to be somebody

372
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:21,508
that I will be meeting
quite intimately

373
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,477
if you fuck with me.

374
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:28,948
Take care, buddy.

375
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,187
(door slams)

376
00:25:41,294 --> 00:25:42,860
- Jack.

377
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:44,227
- Hey baby.

378
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:46,262
Can you untie me?

379
00:25:47,232 --> 00:25:49,099
- Hold on, hold still.

380
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:50,132
What the fuck, Jack.

381
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:52,134
What happened?

382
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:54,536
- Looks like I stole
from some bad guys, babe.

383
00:25:57,373 --> 00:25:59,440
- Are you ok?

384
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:01,908
- Avalon, they took
all your money, doll.

385
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,110
They took all the money.

386
00:26:03,112 --> 00:26:04,377
But it's ok, I've
got it worked out.

387
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:05,879
All right, we got a deal
and I'm going to get

388
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:07,114
your money back and I'm
going to get you more money.

389
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:08,047
- No, no, no, no, no.

390
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,315
Listen to me.

391
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,783
Ok?

392
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:13,085
It's only money, Jack.

393
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:14,385
I'm worried about you.

394
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:15,787
Are you ok?

395
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:16,988
- Yeah, I'm ok.

396
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,589
- Good.

397
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:18,490
- I'm ok.

398
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:21,058
Let's go to the bathroom.

399
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,793
(coughing)

400
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:25,262
I'm sorry, baby.

401
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:27,230
I'm so fucking sorry.

402
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:39,707
(thunder)

403
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,810
- So you're pissed?

404
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:48,581
- I think it was
crazy and stupid.

405
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:54,019
But...

406
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,955
I also think it was
kind of romantic

407
00:26:57,957 --> 00:27:01,159
that you robbed a
bank just for me.

408
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,661
- I'm glad you feel
that way, babe.

409
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:11,066
Because I'm going
to do it again.

410
00:27:12,336 --> 00:27:14,502
(sighing)

411
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:17,338
- You sure about that, Jack?

412
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,040
- I don't have a real job.

413
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:20,941
If I don't do what
this guy says,

414
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:21,942
I'm going to be in deep...

415
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:23,944
- Shhh.

416
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:28,948
Money's not important.

417
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:34,119
Now, let's straighten
out the bedroom,

418
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:36,054
so that I can take care of you.

419
00:28:13,753 --> 00:28:16,554
(phone ringing)

420
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:27,597
- Yeah?

421
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,498
- [Neeron] You ready?

422
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,933
- Yeah, we're ready.

423
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:33,101
- Listen carefully.

424
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:37,038
There's a bank in the
town of Sesopoung.

425
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,109
Next Wednesday,
exactly 2 o'clock.

426
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:45,011
Not before.

427
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:48,047
Not a minute later.

428
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:49,215
Do you understand?

429
00:28:49,217 --> 00:28:50,382
- Yeah, 2 pm.

430
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:52,117
Highway six.

431
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,552
- On your way back
to the border,

432
00:28:53,554 --> 00:28:55,953
there's an old petrol depot.

433
00:28:55,955 --> 00:28:58,623
Just off of the highway.

434
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:01,025
You'll see a black BMW.

435
00:29:01,027 --> 00:29:04,094
Go there immediately
after the job.

436
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,863
Jack.

437
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:09,365
I know exactly how much
money is in the bank.

438
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:12,434
So don't try and
be wise with me.

439
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:14,369
- Don't worry about it.

440
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:21,308
(sighing)

441
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:37,221
(quiet flute music)

442
00:30:47,615 --> 00:30:49,614
(buzzing)

443
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,149
- [Intercom] Yeah?

444
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:54,052
- Yo, I got to talk
to greedy Greg.

445
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:56,187
Tell him it's Jack.

446
00:31:45,997 --> 00:31:48,998
(barking)

447
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,532
- Shut up, Ewy.

448
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,468
There's a courier
without a goddamn box.

449
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,173
- Thanks for seeing
me like this, greedy.

450
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:00,541
Sorry I haven't been around.

451
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,242
- Save that shit, man.

452
00:32:02,244 --> 00:32:04,511
What you want?

453
00:32:04,513 --> 00:32:06,045
- Well this may seem
kind of strange,

454
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:09,515
but over the last few
years making runs for you,

455
00:32:09,517 --> 00:32:11,884
I've noticed that
well, the packages,

456
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:15,920
sometimes, sometimes
inside of them there's...

457
00:32:15,922 --> 00:32:18,055
- Yo, nigga get to the point.

458
00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:20,524
You see I'm doing
some shit right?

459
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:22,793
I don't have time
for this bullshit.

460
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:24,094
- I wanted to pick something up.

461
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:25,928
- Pick something up like what?

462
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,363
- I want to buy some heat.

463
00:32:27,365 --> 00:32:28,931
- Heat?

464
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:31,065
- Guns, man.

465
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:32,934
- I know what mother
fucking heat is.

466
00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:35,203
What I don't know
is who sent your

467
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:38,071
1989 talking ass here for guns.

468
00:32:38,073 --> 00:32:39,973
- The packages, greedy.

469
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:41,942
I've got to open them sometimes.

470
00:32:41,944 --> 00:32:43,142
Look man, you know I've
never taken anything

471
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:44,944
off the top on a job.

472
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:47,880
I'm only here tonight
because some of your bags,

473
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,382
they got gun parts in them, man.

474
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:52,317
Rifle rounds, large magazines.

475
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,952
Machine gun shit.

476
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:55,553
Now I've been doing
some new work lately.

477
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:57,154
Some work that requires
more than a pistol

478
00:32:57,156 --> 00:32:58,122
and I don't know
where to get that kind

479
00:32:58,124 --> 00:33:00,991
of shit this side of the world.

480
00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:04,227
I thought maybe you could help.

481
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:07,830
Look, man, maybe
this is a bad idea.

482
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:08,997
I can just leave.

483
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,399
- No, no, no you
ain't just leaving.

484
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:11,900
You ain't going nowhere.

485
00:33:11,902 --> 00:33:13,601
You understand me?

486
00:33:13,603 --> 00:33:16,504
What you going to do is you
going to lift that shirt.

487
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:19,940
I'm serious, man.

488
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:21,541
I ain't playing with you.

489
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:27,947
- I ain't wearing
a wire, greedy.

490
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:31,416
I just got no where else to go.

491
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:38,121
- All right, all right.

492
00:33:38,123 --> 00:33:42,025
I'm not one to turn away
business, you understand?

493
00:33:42,027 --> 00:33:44,360
Let's see what paper you've got.

494
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:50,131
- American.

495
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:52,834
- Now we talking.

496
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:55,503
So what kind of heat you
looking for this evening?

497
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:57,304
- AR 15.

498
00:33:57,306 --> 00:33:58,772
Beretta M9.

499
00:33:58,774 --> 00:34:00,508
AK, sub machine guns, shot guns,

500
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,275
anything heavy.

501
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:04,844
- All right.

502
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:07,913
Let's take him upstairs, fellas.

503
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,124
Bam.

504
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,527
- Yeah.

505
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,128
Yeah.

506
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,063
Yeah, this will do.

507
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:34,536
Maybe this.

508
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:35,937
Definitely that.

509
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,238
- Ok.

510
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Good choice.

511
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:50,048
You know, I like you, Jack.

512
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,317
I hope you're not getting
in over your head.

513
00:34:56,088 --> 00:34:57,655
- Then the guard
went for his gun,

514
00:34:57,657 --> 00:34:59,323
and I looked at him real mean.

515
00:34:59,325 --> 00:35:01,190
He knew if he
touched his pistol,

516
00:35:01,192 --> 00:35:03,226
I'd take him out just like that.

517
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,194
Nobody moved after that.

518
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:08,030
Until we were leaving, and
I shot the fucking shit.

519
00:35:08,032 --> 00:35:09,698
All right, Jack.

520
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,166
What happened to you?

521
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:12,267
- You've got a voice that
carries, you know that, pal?

522
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:13,501
- I was telling Tracy or Sharon,

523
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:15,002
or whatever her
fucking name is about

524
00:35:15,004 --> 00:35:16,737
some TV show, that's all, mate.

525
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,472
- Can I talk to my friend?

526
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:20,907
- What'd you do that for?

527
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:23,376
I was about to tap
her fucking ass.

528
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:25,177
- Let me talk to you outside.

529
00:35:31,451 --> 00:35:32,684
- What's up, Jack?

530
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:34,085
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

531
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:35,053
Talking about our
business in a fucking bar.

532
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:36,020
Are you stupid?

533
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:37,020
- Don't call me stupid.

534
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:38,922
I let you get away with it once.

535
00:35:38,924 --> 00:35:40,591
Don't fucking test me, ok?

536
00:35:40,593 --> 00:35:42,059
That was Cambodia.

537
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:43,259
The place can't touch us here.

538
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:44,860
- We don't know that, Sam.

539
00:35:44,862 --> 00:35:46,128
Maybe they can.

540
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,129
Maybe somebody wants
their money back.

541
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:48,964
Did you ever think about that?

542
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:50,932
- What're you trying to say?

543
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:53,368
- I'm just saying,
use your head.

544
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,902
I'm serious, man.

545
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:56,937
Because we're doing it again.

546
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:59,173
- Ok.

547
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:27,496
- Everybody down.

548
00:36:28,299 --> 00:36:29,898
Get down.

549
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:32,500
Everybody down.

550
00:36:32,502 --> 00:36:34,135
This is a robbery,
nobody fucking move.

551
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:35,503
On the floor now.

552
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:36,104
(gun shots)

553
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:36,970
(groaning)

554
00:36:36,972 --> 00:36:38,839
Dammit, Sam.

555
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:40,007
Fuck.

556
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:41,141
You, get up, manager, go.

557
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:42,442
You open the safe.

558
00:36:42,444 --> 00:36:43,175
Open the safe.

559
00:36:43,177 --> 00:36:44,777
Go, go, go.

560
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:46,078
- Keep your mouth shut.

561
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,014
Keep down, mother fuckers.

562
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:49,981
- Out, out, out.

563
00:36:52,285 --> 00:36:54,052
Shit.

564
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:00,923
(laughing)

565
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:06,229
- Shut up.

566
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,700
- All right, we're out.

567
00:37:11,702 --> 00:37:12,967
- Good job, Jack.

568
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,635
You saved 15
seconds of our time.

569
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:16,003
Good man.

570
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:18,205
- God damn it.

571
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:20,807
- Tell them it was the two
(speaking a foreign language).

572
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:22,709
- Stop saying that.

573
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,730
A little trigger happy back
there, don't you think, Sam?

574
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,064
- That's the way it goes down.

575
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,865
No room, no time
for nothing else.

576
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,500
I only shot him in
the fucking leg.

577
00:37:52,502 --> 00:37:53,802
- That was a cell phone.

578
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,069
- What if it wasn't?

579
00:37:55,071 --> 00:37:57,671
Who reaches inside their
jacket during a robbery?

580
00:37:57,673 --> 00:37:59,373
You told me to
cover your ass, Jack

581
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,907
and as normal, I'm
covering your ass,

582
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:02,675
and mine at the same time.

583
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:04,243
- Sam, cover us, don't
shoot a mother fucker

584
00:38:04,245 --> 00:38:06,079
just because he moves.

585
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:07,312
Do you want to kill somebody?

586
00:38:07,314 --> 00:38:08,380
Is that your gig?

587
00:38:08,382 --> 00:38:09,715
Because that's not mine.

588
00:38:09,717 --> 00:38:10,849
All right, we rob banks.

589
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:12,883
That's it.

590
00:38:12,885 --> 00:38:15,319
- All right.

591
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:19,489
- Now follow me.

592
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:21,224
We've got to make a stop.

593
00:38:55,888 --> 00:38:56,887
- What're we doing here, Jack?

594
00:38:56,889 --> 00:38:58,188
- God damn it, Sam.

595
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,124
Not another word till
we get back to Bangkok.

596
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:01,591
All right, you're getting paid.

597
00:39:01,593 --> 00:39:02,959
Stay put.

598
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:04,994
- Who's that in that car?

599
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:15,069
- Your boyfriend.

600
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:16,737
He know about us?

601
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:18,579
- He knows what
he needs to know.

602
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,541
- Nice feeling right?

603
00:39:21,543 --> 00:39:23,309
Taking what you want.

604
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:25,144
Being in control.

605
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:26,912
- I don't feel much in
control right now, Neeron.

606
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:28,413
- No?

607
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:30,149
All that money.

608
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:32,984
And Avalon.

609
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:34,952
How is she?

610
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:38,555
Is she at that silly Thai
aerobics class of hers?

611
00:39:38,557 --> 00:39:39,723
- I swear to God.

612
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,057
You stay the fuck away from her.

613
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:42,725
- It must feel good
to have enough money

614
00:39:42,727 --> 00:39:45,094
to take care of this
young, hot, beautiful

615
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:46,295
and sexy...

616
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:51,299
Be slow, errand boy.

617
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,268
Now ease off that.

618
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,169
There we go.

619
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:57,704
We're buddies, right?

620
00:39:58,974 --> 00:40:00,673
Ok.

621
00:40:01,476 --> 00:40:03,509
You guys were lucky last
time crossing the border.

622
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:06,645
Now that I have an interest
in you not being caught,

623
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:08,613
I'm going to show
you an old tunnel

624
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,782
that we used to run
shipments through.

625
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,150
Come on.

626
00:40:12,152 --> 00:40:14,084
Follow me.

627
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:21,157
(intense bass music)

628
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:01,540
A guard was killed.

629
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:03,609
Was that necessary?

630
00:42:03,611 --> 00:42:05,511
- What are you
getting soft, Neeron?

631
00:42:05,513 --> 00:42:07,145
What's it matter to you?

632
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:11,783
- You're not a killer, Jack.

633
00:42:11,785 --> 00:42:13,017
You tell your partner
there to watch his

634
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:15,386
trigger finger or
he's going to lose it.

635
00:42:15,388 --> 00:42:17,755
Understood?

636
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:23,927
- Who you giving up, Neeron?

637
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:25,260
For these jobs.

638
00:42:25,262 --> 00:42:27,596
Moving up in the world, huh?

639
00:42:29,934 --> 00:42:31,966
- (speaking foreign language)

640
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:33,601
And that's all you need to know.

641
00:42:33,603 --> 00:42:36,603
- No I need to know when
we're going to be square.

642
00:42:36,605 --> 00:42:38,638
- Square?

643
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:42,942
Square has nothing
to do with it, Jack.

644
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:45,277
You'll know when I'm
through with you.

645
00:42:47,882 --> 00:42:49,514
Later, buddy.

646
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:07,062
- The way I look at it,
it's like this fish.

647
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:09,931
People saying well I
shouldn't eat the fish

648
00:43:09,933 --> 00:43:15,002
because the fish is you know,
an important sentient being

649
00:43:15,237 --> 00:43:16,670
and that's true.

650
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:17,571
- Excuse me, sir.

651
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:19,305
I have some news.

652
00:43:19,307 --> 00:43:21,808
- Is it important?

653
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,010
- Please, sir.

654
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:30,915
- Excuse me.

655
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,090
- I found them already.

656
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:41,491
I'll take care of it right now.

657
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,359
- Then take care of it.

658
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:43,625
- I will, sir.

659
00:43:43,627 --> 00:43:45,127
- But you know I'm
just thinking that

660
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:47,329
I'm not really
feeling confident.

661
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:02,141
- So what's this surprise
you've been telling me about?

662
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:04,010
- What do you think?

663
00:44:04,012 --> 00:44:06,012
- This is yours?

664
00:44:06,014 --> 00:44:08,013
- Fucking A it is.

665
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:09,614
- God damn it, Sam.

666
00:44:09,616 --> 00:44:11,116
You are taking this back, man.

667
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:12,317
- No way.

668
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,517
- You don't even have a job.

669
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:14,985
How are you going
to explain this?

670
00:44:14,987 --> 00:44:16,286
- You're spending all
of your money on Avalon.

671
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:17,488
No offense, Avalon.

672
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,222
- That is not the
same thing, man.

673
00:44:18,224 --> 00:44:19,522
- Fucking sure it is.

674
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:21,190
I can spend my money
on what I like.

675
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:22,892
Now piss off.

676
00:44:37,072 --> 00:44:39,205
- Fuck.

677
00:44:42,077 --> 00:44:43,375
- You were kind of
rough on him, Jack.

678
00:44:43,377 --> 00:44:44,910
- Just stay out of it, Avalon.

679
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:46,412
- Fuck you, Jack.

680
00:44:46,414 --> 00:44:48,047
Take me home now.

681
00:44:48,049 --> 00:44:49,347
- Baby, I'm sorry.

682
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:51,215
- Now.

683
00:44:55,521 --> 00:44:56,887
- [Avalon] Jack and
Sam fought sometimes

684
00:44:56,889 --> 00:44:58,588
like a married couple.

685
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,690
The stress was affecting
us all in different ways.

686
00:45:01,692 --> 00:45:04,894
Or maybe it was guilt.

687
00:45:04,896 --> 00:45:06,895
Clearly we were taking shortcuts

688
00:45:06,897 --> 00:45:09,330
to try and make our
dreams come true.

689
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,933
And everything was
getting too real.

690
00:45:11,935 --> 00:45:14,501
The fairy tale started
to crack apart.

691
00:45:26,947 --> 00:45:29,014
- You ready?

692
00:45:29,016 --> 00:45:30,948
- Whatever.

693
00:45:36,222 --> 00:45:37,287
- (speaking in a
foreign language)

694
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:38,221
Everybody down.

695
00:45:38,223 --> 00:45:39,556
This is a robbery, you down.

696
00:45:39,558 --> 00:45:41,925
- You're making a big mistake.

697
00:45:41,927 --> 00:45:44,960
This is the Cerrancurie's money.

698
00:45:46,263 --> 00:45:47,863
- You, big guy, get down.

699
00:45:47,865 --> 00:45:49,297
Down on the ground.

700
00:45:56,305 --> 00:45:59,206
Last chance.

701
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:01,107
- You're both dead men.

702
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:02,608
- He said get down.

703
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,977
- All right, manager,
you, keys, keys.

704
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:07,112
Let's go, let's go.

705
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:08,446
- (speaking foreign language)

706
00:46:08,448 --> 00:46:10,982
You and your men
still near point bed?

707
00:46:10,984 --> 00:46:12,816
Yeah.

708
00:46:12,818 --> 00:46:13,817
Yeah, the (speaking
a foreign language)

709
00:46:13,819 --> 00:46:14,585
are making a move right now.

710
00:46:14,587 --> 00:46:16,487
Go do what I would do.

711
00:46:20,992 --> 00:46:23,292
(police sirens)

712
00:46:25,662 --> 00:46:27,996
(gun fire)

713
00:46:28,298 --> 00:46:29,998
(police sirens)

714
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,233
(gun fire)

715
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,309
- Sam, I got to go to the bikes.

716
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:45,944
Cover me.

717
00:46:45,946 --> 00:46:48,180
(tires screeching)

718
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:51,983
(gun fire)

719
00:46:51,985 --> 00:46:53,117
Who the fuck are these guys?

720
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,818
- How the hell should I know?

721
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,685
- Come on, man.

722
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,088
(gun fire)

723
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:05,928
(gun fire)

724
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:26,845
Sam, we have got to
get to the bikes, man.

725
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:30,848
Move, move, move.

726
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,949
Go.

727
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:36,452
(gun fire)

728
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,449
(tires screeching)

729
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,588
(police siren)

730
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,941
(gun shots)

731
00:49:34,253 --> 00:49:36,719
- Over half a million dollars.

732
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:40,623
Somebody just came
into my banks and

733
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:43,425
took that fucking money.

734
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:46,928
They took the money
because someone

735
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:50,031
told them it was there.

736
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:54,668
Waiting for them.

737
00:49:56,138 --> 00:49:59,139
These two (speaking a foreign
language) are dead men.

738
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:01,840
We can find them and
we can kill them.

739
00:50:01,842 --> 00:50:05,444
But what's more
important is to find out

740
00:50:05,446 --> 00:50:08,680
who the fucking rat is.

741
00:50:08,682 --> 00:50:11,115
On the inside.

742
00:50:11,117 --> 00:50:13,784
Because I think we know
this is an inside job.

743
00:50:13,786 --> 00:50:16,186
Don't we?

744
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:18,788
- Looking at the banks, I'd
say these guys are coming

745
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,623
from Thailand.

746
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:22,825
They cross the border,
they do the job,

747
00:50:22,827 --> 00:50:25,860
and they go back.

748
00:50:27,597 --> 00:50:29,698
- Well, I'll get the money back

749
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,801
but at this point, I'm not
as concerned about the money

750
00:50:33,803 --> 00:50:36,903
as my feelings.

751
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:44,876
I would really hate
to kill you, you know.

752
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:47,446
It would break my
heart to kill you.

753
00:50:48,948 --> 00:50:51,148
- If you think I turned on you,

754
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,817
you do what you've got to.

755
00:50:52,819 --> 00:50:56,186
I have nothing to be scared of.

756
00:50:57,856 --> 00:50:59,689
- Unfortunately...

757
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:07,895
I'm going to have to
wait to do what I do.

758
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:09,831
Just a little bit longer.

759
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,998
Because I want to
be sure I don't

760
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,668
kill anybody innocent.

761
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:17,003
A quarter of a million
dollars to any one

762
00:51:17,005 --> 00:51:21,073
of my brothers who
finds me this rat.

763
00:51:24,811 --> 00:51:28,546
I want his head put
in this fucking tray.

764
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:30,748
By tomorrow.

765
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:36,853
- I don't know what happened.

766
00:51:36,855 --> 00:51:39,555
These jobs are suppose to
always be easy pickings.

767
00:51:39,557 --> 00:51:41,724
- Maybe your secret connection
ain't that connected

768
00:51:41,726 --> 00:51:42,891
after all.

769
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:44,526
What'd you think of
that crazy bastard man?

770
00:51:44,528 --> 00:51:46,561
This hairy Carry's
brother's money.

771
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:48,162
- These guys are bad news, man.

772
00:51:48,164 --> 00:51:49,363
They're drug lords.

773
00:51:49,365 --> 00:51:50,698
I heard about them on the news.

774
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,565
It's probably their
guys who shot the shit

775
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,200
out of us.

776
00:51:53,202 --> 00:51:55,769
- And that crazy monkey
running son of a bitch.

777
00:51:55,771 --> 00:51:58,238
This guy you're meeting
after every job.

778
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,005
Bro, you need to
tell me who he is.

779
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:02,007
- I really don't know, Sam.

780
00:52:02,009 --> 00:52:02,841
He might be from a rival gang,

781
00:52:02,843 --> 00:52:03,909
he might be an inside guy.

782
00:52:03,911 --> 00:52:05,677
I just don't know.

783
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:07,845
- Look, this shit's running deep

784
00:52:07,847 --> 00:52:11,349
and I need to know who's
out to kill my ass.

785
00:52:11,351 --> 00:52:13,617
- What do you suggest man?

786
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:15,886
I'm lost here.

787
00:52:15,888 --> 00:52:18,187
- Let me have a think about it.

788
00:52:21,692 --> 00:52:23,592
- Hey, Sam.

789
00:52:23,594 --> 00:52:25,727
That was good shooting.

790
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:27,495
- Cheers.

791
00:52:55,053 --> 00:52:57,954
(phone ringing)

792
00:52:57,956 --> 00:53:00,556
- Yeah, Neeron.

793
00:53:00,558 --> 00:53:02,424
What do you got for me?

794
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:04,226
- Another bank score.

795
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:06,127
Biggest one yet.

796
00:53:06,129 --> 00:53:07,962
Next week.

797
00:53:07,964 --> 00:53:09,897
A bank in Siem Reap.

798
00:53:09,899 --> 00:53:11,666
- That's good news.

799
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:13,834
Because it's the last one.

800
00:53:13,836 --> 00:53:15,802
- I'll tell you when
it's the last score.

801
00:53:15,804 --> 00:53:17,137
- Hey fuck face.

802
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:20,172
The commute is not
working for me anymore.

803
00:53:20,174 --> 00:53:21,507
All right, and if
you don't like it

804
00:53:21,509 --> 00:53:23,442
maybe I'll tell the
Cerrancurie brothers

805
00:53:23,444 --> 00:53:26,978
that you're the one that's
been feeding me these jobs.

806
00:53:31,817 --> 00:53:35,018
Did that get your
attention, asshole?

807
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,687
- And how are you
going to do that, Jack?

808
00:53:37,689 --> 00:53:39,989
You're just going to
waltz into their compound,

809
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:41,157
introduce yourself?

810
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:42,757
What, I'm the
American that's been

811
00:53:42,759 --> 00:53:44,926
jacking your banks?

812
00:53:44,928 --> 00:53:47,795
You have no fucking
idea who these men are.

813
00:53:47,797 --> 00:53:49,597
- That may be the case.

814
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,932
But you really should
listen to this.

815
00:53:51,934 --> 00:53:54,200
Yeah, Neeron, what
do you got for me?

816
00:53:54,202 --> 00:53:55,869
- [Neeron] Another bank score.

817
00:53:55,871 --> 00:53:57,270
Biggest one yet.

818
00:53:57,272 --> 00:53:58,671
Next week.

819
00:53:58,673 --> 00:54:00,005
A bank in Siem Reap.

820
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:02,875
- Think they'll recognize
that voice, Neeron?

821
00:54:02,877 --> 00:54:04,009
How long you think
you're going to be alive

822
00:54:04,011 --> 00:54:06,043
after they hear that?

823
00:54:11,984 --> 00:54:14,050
- Ok, cowboy.

824
00:54:17,022 --> 00:54:18,554
We'll play your way.

825
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:20,122
One last score.

826
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:22,458
You give me my cut,
you make some money,

827
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,960
then we'll go happily ever
after into the sunset.

828
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:30,130
And then we'll be,
what did you say?

829
00:54:30,132 --> 00:54:32,165
Square.

830
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:34,167
- Square?

831
00:54:34,169 --> 00:54:36,836
Yeah, fuck you square.

832
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:38,671
I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life

833
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:40,840
looking over my
shoulder, Neeron.

834
00:54:40,842 --> 00:54:44,576
And I am not every going
to let you hurt Avalon.

835
00:54:46,813 --> 00:54:48,579
- Until next time.

836
00:54:59,823 --> 00:55:02,524
- Sam, there's something I
want to talk to you about, man.

837
00:55:02,526 --> 00:55:04,426
After tomorrow's job,
Avalon and I are going to

838
00:55:04,428 --> 00:55:05,693
skip town.

839
00:55:05,695 --> 00:55:07,094
- Where are you going to go?

840
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:08,863
- Don't know yet.

841
00:55:08,865 --> 00:55:11,499
- Don't know or don't trust me?

842
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:14,067
- Don't know.

843
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,574
What're we doing?

844
00:55:23,244 --> 00:55:25,510
- Do me a favor, get
me another drink.

845
00:55:25,512 --> 00:55:26,945
I'll be back in ten minutes.

846
00:55:26,947 --> 00:55:29,880
- That yabba shit is going
to kill you one day, man.

847
00:55:29,882 --> 00:55:31,782
- You've got your
vices, I've got mine.

848
00:55:31,784 --> 00:55:33,717
- Oh, yeah, what's mine?

849
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:35,252
- Avalon's snatch.

850
00:55:35,254 --> 00:55:37,353
- Get the fuck out of here, man.

851
00:55:39,857 --> 00:55:42,290
Hey man (speaking a
foreign language).

852
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:43,925
Cigarettes, do you
sell cigarettes?

853
00:55:43,927 --> 00:55:45,794
Ok, cool.

854
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,369
Whiskey?

855
00:55:56,371 --> 00:55:57,937
And water.

856
00:55:57,939 --> 00:55:59,938
(speaking a foreign language)

857
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,407
- Sick ride you got, Sammy.

858
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:04,142
- [Sam] I want to
get wasted, you know?

859
00:56:04,144 --> 00:56:06,844
- Ok, cool, thanks man.

860
00:56:07,714 --> 00:56:09,981
- Get the fuck out of
the car, mother fucker.

861
00:56:11,783 --> 00:56:12,983
Put your hands down.

862
00:56:12,985 --> 00:56:15,018
(gun shot)

863
00:56:18,389 --> 00:56:21,857
(yelling)

864
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:34,801
(gun shot)

865
00:56:38,906 --> 00:56:40,973
- Hey, hey you.

866
00:56:42,976 --> 00:56:43,775
Sam?

867
00:56:43,777 --> 00:56:44,576
Sam?

868
00:56:44,578 --> 00:56:46,011
Sam, god damn it, Sam.

869
00:56:46,013 --> 00:56:47,412
Oh fuck, man.

870
00:56:47,414 --> 00:56:49,980
Hey, buddy.

871
00:56:49,982 --> 00:56:53,150
- I don't think I'm going
to make the next job.

872
00:56:53,152 --> 00:56:54,617
- Don't worry about that, man,

873
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,985
ok, we're going to
get you some help.

874
00:56:55,987 --> 00:56:57,787
We're going to get you
the fuck out of here, ok?

875
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,855
- You were right.

876
00:56:59,857 --> 00:57:03,125
You said this shit
would kill me.

877
00:57:03,127 --> 00:57:04,359
- Sam?

878
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:05,760
Sam, no, no, no, no don't.

879
00:57:05,762 --> 00:57:07,795
No, don't, man.

880
00:57:07,797 --> 00:57:10,831
Sam, don't fucking do this, man.

881
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:12,499
Fuck.

882
00:57:12,501 --> 00:57:14,000
Sam?

883
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:15,869
Sam?

884
00:57:15,871 --> 00:57:16,436
Sam?

885
00:57:16,438 --> 00:57:17,936
Fuck.

886
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:20,372
Fuck.

887
00:57:20,374 --> 00:57:22,107
God damn it.

888
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:25,309
(crying)

889
00:57:25,311 --> 00:57:27,679
Sam, mother fucker.

890
00:57:27,681 --> 00:57:31,114
(crying)

891
00:57:32,885 --> 00:57:35,285
Oh fuck.

892
00:58:11,017 --> 00:58:13,149
Oh, Sam.

893
00:58:15,921 --> 00:58:17,353
Yeah.

894
00:58:17,355 --> 00:58:19,988
Yeah, I'll bet
you're real torn up.

895
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:24,258
Yeah, yeah.

896
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,160
Yeah, I got it.

897
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:29,596
Fuck that was fast.

898
00:58:29,598 --> 00:58:31,565
- What?

899
00:58:31,567 --> 00:58:33,533
- That was my connection.

900
00:58:33,535 --> 00:58:35,901
The guy heard about Sam.

901
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,003
Says I still got to go
through with this next job

902
00:58:38,005 --> 00:58:40,005
or all bets are off.

903
00:58:40,007 --> 00:58:42,173
- Well, what does that mean?

904
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:44,943
- It's not good.

905
00:58:46,847 --> 00:58:49,546
- Well, you can't pull
it off alone, right?

906
00:58:49,548 --> 00:58:50,914
- No.

907
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:53,217
No way.

908
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:55,785
I got to find a new partner.

909
00:58:55,787 --> 00:58:57,420
Somebody I can trust.

910
00:58:58,523 --> 00:59:00,122
- Well...

911
00:59:00,124 --> 00:59:02,224
You're looking at her.

912
00:59:02,226 --> 00:59:05,093
- Honey, I wasn't
saying that for you.

913
00:59:05,095 --> 00:59:07,795
- Who better to
watch your back, huh?

914
00:59:07,797 --> 00:59:09,864
Sam was your first
choice, I get it.

915
00:59:09,866 --> 00:59:11,265
He was your best friend.

916
00:59:11,267 --> 00:59:12,766
But now that he got
himself killed...

917
00:59:12,768 --> 00:59:14,868
- No, Avalon, there's
no fucking way.

918
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:16,970
- Come on, I'm perfect.

919
00:59:16,972 --> 00:59:19,371
I've listened to every
detail of your other jobs.

920
00:59:19,373 --> 00:59:20,873
I know what to do.

921
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:22,141
- Yeah, I know you're perfect.

922
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:23,541
But there's a bit fucking
difference between

923
00:59:23,543 --> 00:59:24,942
hearing about a bank
robbery and actually

924
00:59:24,944 --> 00:59:26,077
robbing a bank.

925
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,079
- Yeah, so how did you start?

926
00:59:28,081 --> 00:59:29,147
- That's not important.

927
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,380
- Why, Jack?

928
00:59:30,382 --> 00:59:31,314
Why won't you let
me do this with you?

929
00:59:31,316 --> 00:59:32,482
- I don't have to tell you why.

930
00:59:32,484 --> 00:59:33,950
- Yes, you do.

931
00:59:33,952 --> 00:59:36,986
- Because I don't
want you to get hurt.

932
00:59:39,624 --> 00:59:41,856
Now that's it, end of story.

933
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:46,161
- Check this.

934
00:59:51,934 --> 00:59:54,834
I can handle this gun
with my eyes closed, Jack.

935
00:59:54,836 --> 00:59:59,005
When I was growing up,
my father taught me how

936
00:59:59,007 --> 01:00:01,940
to shoot the snot off
any predator on earth.

937
01:00:01,942 --> 01:00:02,974
- That may be so,
but it's different.

938
01:00:02,976 --> 01:00:07,511
- And with a body like this,

939
01:00:09,749 --> 01:00:13,216
you better believe I know
how to protect myself.

940
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,920
- What if you've got
to shoot somebody?

941
01:00:17,922 --> 01:00:19,955
Because on this job
we might have to.

942
01:00:19,957 --> 01:00:22,090
You ready for that, Avalon?

943
01:00:22,092 --> 01:00:23,591
You ready to kill somebody?

944
01:00:23,593 --> 01:00:24,659
Without hesitation?

945
01:00:24,661 --> 01:00:26,260
Look him right in the eye?

946
01:00:26,262 --> 01:00:28,262
Because that's going to happen.

947
01:00:28,264 --> 01:00:30,831
- I'll do what it takes
to protect you out there.

948
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:34,334
Just like how you've
been protecting me

949
01:00:34,336 --> 01:00:36,502
since the first day we met.

950
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:41,539
I don't want to
kill anyone, Jack.

951
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:46,611
But if it means you'd
be safe I'd do it.

952
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,350
- This is crazy.

953
01:00:54,352 --> 01:00:56,786
You're crazy.

954
01:00:57,388 --> 01:00:59,121
- So...

955
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:02,891
- Ok.

956
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:05,260
Let's go through it.

957
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,964
Yeah, let's do it, here we go.

958
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,541
- [Avalon] Didn't think I'd
find a car this fast, did you?

959
01:01:22,543 --> 01:01:25,376
- You got all the moves, baby.

960
01:01:27,914 --> 01:01:29,546
(laughing)

961
01:01:29,548 --> 01:01:31,748
Now let's go over it again.

962
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,885
- Ok, but I know what to do.

963
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:55,001
(groaning)

964
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,006
- Hey, Lucky, how are you?

965
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,008
- Mr. Cerrancurie.

966
01:02:04,278 --> 01:02:06,577
- Looks like your man
doesn't play by the rules.

967
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:09,513
- It's just a little practice
before the fight tonight.

968
01:02:09,515 --> 01:02:11,781
- You got any big
money on the fight?

969
01:02:11,783 --> 01:02:13,016
- That's right.

970
01:02:13,018 --> 01:02:15,752
You know it takes big
money to make big money.

971
01:02:15,754 --> 01:02:16,953
- Where you got
that kind of money?

972
01:02:16,955 --> 01:02:19,454
I can afford that, how
you can afford that?

973
01:02:19,456 --> 01:02:22,758
- You insinuating I had
something to do with that shit?

974
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,758
- I'm just asking you a question

975
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,959
to see what you had to say.

976
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:26,727
- I can't stand up to you.

977
01:02:26,729 --> 01:02:28,930
You want to think that of me?

978
01:02:28,932 --> 01:02:31,364
I'm loyal till death.

979
01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:34,634
You've got no right to
accuse me of anything.

980
01:02:35,803 --> 01:02:38,037
- We heard about the bank.

981
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:39,471
You just let those two
(speaking a foreign language)

982
01:02:39,473 --> 01:02:40,773
get away with our money.

983
01:02:40,775 --> 01:02:42,473
- Hey, they almost split
my fucking head open.

984
01:02:42,475 --> 01:02:45,310
I spent the night
in the hospital.

985
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,646
- He's all right, man.

986
01:02:49,648 --> 01:02:50,914
- Look, ever since
you guys took over,

987
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:53,416
I play by your rules.

988
01:02:53,418 --> 01:02:54,951
Giving you your share
of the gambling.

989
01:02:54,953 --> 01:02:56,819
I got nothing to hide.

990
01:02:56,821 --> 01:02:58,688
- Let him go.

991
01:03:20,774 --> 01:03:23,841
- Big money on the
fight tonight, huh?

992
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:25,543
Good luck with that.

993
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:50,797
- Babe, what are you doing?

994
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,299
- What?

995
01:03:52,301 --> 01:03:53,833
It's not like I'm ever
going to get a chance

996
01:03:53,835 --> 01:03:55,034
to do this again, ok?

997
01:03:55,036 --> 01:03:56,335
I've got to look good.

998
01:03:56,337 --> 01:03:58,704
- Babe, do you
remember, we wear these?

999
01:03:58,706 --> 01:04:00,538
A little extra protection.

1000
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,108
It covers our face.

1001
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:04,776
- Fine.

1002
01:04:05,878 --> 01:04:08,946
Well, just in case, I want to
look good for the mug shot.

1003
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,052
- You're ridiculous.

1004
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:29,629
(speaking a foreign language)

1005
01:04:29,631 --> 01:04:30,463
Everybody down.

1006
01:04:30,465 --> 01:04:31,731
This is a robbery.

1007
01:04:31,733 --> 01:04:35,068
(gun shot)

1008
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:38,370
You, you, you, (speaking
a foreign language),

1009
01:04:38,372 --> 01:04:39,405
open the fucking door.

1010
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:41,406
Hey get out, get the fuck out.

1011
01:04:41,408 --> 01:04:42,840
You over there, there, there.

1012
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:45,376
Told you open that fucking door.

1013
01:04:45,378 --> 01:04:49,246
(suspenseful music)

1014
01:05:18,272 --> 01:05:21,273
(police siren)

1015
01:05:22,443 --> 01:05:23,707
Avalon, go.

1016
01:05:23,709 --> 01:05:25,943
(gun fire)

1017
01:05:35,719 --> 01:05:37,719
- Jack, start the car.

1018
01:05:37,721 --> 01:05:40,022
(gun shots)

1019
01:05:47,129 --> 01:05:49,596
(groaning)

1020
01:05:52,067 --> 01:05:54,300
(tires screeching)

1021
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:04,742
- You know, I must be
a dumb mother fucker

1022
01:06:04,744 --> 01:06:06,210
or something because
I keep putting my

1023
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:08,912
money in these banks.

1024
01:06:08,914 --> 01:06:10,881
And the only reason
why I did that is

1025
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:13,049
because one of my
most trusted employees

1026
01:06:13,051 --> 01:06:16,486
told me that was the
safe place to put my

1027
01:06:16,488 --> 01:06:19,955
mother fucking money.

1028
01:06:19,957 --> 01:06:24,091
You know, I'm having
trouble believing this shit.

1029
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:26,060
Two (speaking a foreign
language) got away

1030
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:28,996
with 500,000
dollars US currency.

1031
01:06:28,998 --> 01:06:30,997
Neeron.

1032
01:06:30,999 --> 01:06:33,833
You think I'm stupid?

1033
01:06:33,835 --> 01:06:35,834
- No, Mr. Cerrancurie.

1034
01:06:35,836 --> 01:06:37,970
You're the master
mind and I wouldn't

1035
01:06:37,972 --> 01:06:40,973
have gotten this far without
your leadership, sir.

1036
01:06:40,975 --> 01:06:42,773
- To add insult to injury,

1037
01:06:42,775 --> 01:06:45,076
they're telling
me that one of the

1038
01:06:45,078 --> 01:06:47,677
(speaking a foreign
language) is a girl.

1039
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,513
I don't whether to
fucking kill them

1040
01:06:49,515 --> 01:06:51,748
or hire them.

1041
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,016
- What do you think, Neeron?

1042
01:06:54,018 --> 01:06:56,919
- I don't think anything of it.

1043
01:06:56,921 --> 01:06:58,787
I'm not amused.

1044
01:06:58,789 --> 01:07:00,588
Not at all.

1045
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:02,690
- I want these two (speaking
a foreign language) dead.

1046
01:07:02,692 --> 01:07:04,859
And I want them dead today.

1047
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:20,272
- Can you take the wheel, baby?

1048
01:07:20,274 --> 01:07:21,840
- Yeah, ok.

1049
01:07:21,842 --> 01:07:22,807
- Ok, you got it?

1050
01:07:22,809 --> 01:07:23,607
- Yep.

1051
01:07:23,609 --> 01:07:26,076
(groaning)

1052
01:07:27,213 --> 01:07:28,779
- Oh my god, Jack.

1053
01:07:28,781 --> 01:07:29,712
You've been shot.

1054
01:07:29,714 --> 01:07:31,881
- Ok, I've got it.

1055
01:07:31,883 --> 01:07:33,216
- We have to go to a hospital.

1056
01:07:33,218 --> 01:07:34,150
- Are you fucking crazy?

1057
01:07:34,152 --> 01:07:34,950
- Jack.

1058
01:07:34,952 --> 01:07:36,118
- Look at us.

1059
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,119
Do you want to spend
the rest of our lives

1060
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:39,288
in Cambodian prison?

1061
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:42,123
- Ok, ok, fine.

1062
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,824
The next town we get to,
we're going to a pharmacy

1063
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:44,859
and we're going to
get some supplies

1064
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:46,127
to patch you up, ok?

1065
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:47,827
- Ok, that we can do.

1066
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:49,529
Fuck.

1067
01:07:49,531 --> 01:07:51,198
(phone ringing)

1068
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,732
Answer it.

1069
01:07:54,502 --> 01:07:56,235
- Hello?

1070
01:07:56,237 --> 01:07:57,870
- Avalon.

1071
01:07:57,872 --> 01:08:00,972
Is this you, my love?

1072
01:08:00,974 --> 01:08:02,340
- Who is this?

1073
01:08:02,342 --> 01:08:03,875
- Where's Jack?

1074
01:08:03,877 --> 01:08:06,043
- I said who the fuck is this?

1075
01:08:06,045 --> 01:08:07,578
- [Neeron] It's Neeron.

1076
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:10,247
You know, his connection.

1077
01:08:10,249 --> 01:08:12,248
Now let me fucking talk to him.

1078
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,082
- Who's Neeron?

1079
01:08:13,084 --> 01:08:15,084
- Give me the phone.

1080
01:08:15,086 --> 01:08:17,085
Yeah?

1081
01:08:17,087 --> 01:08:18,486
Avalon.

1082
01:08:18,488 --> 01:08:20,222
She's quite spicy.

1083
01:08:20,224 --> 01:08:21,890
- What do you want?

1084
01:08:21,892 --> 01:08:23,857
- [Neeron] I want my share of
the money, you cock sucker.

1085
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:25,559
What do you think?

1086
01:08:25,561 --> 01:08:26,694
Now in an hour meet me...

1087
01:08:26,696 --> 01:08:27,995
- No can do.

1088
01:08:27,997 --> 01:08:28,995
Maybe a little while later.

1089
01:08:28,997 --> 01:08:30,563
Maybe tomorrow.

1090
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:31,764
- If you try to run across
the border with my money

1091
01:08:31,766 --> 01:08:35,033
I swear to God,
there will be nothing

1092
01:08:35,035 --> 01:08:36,902
better for me to do
than hunt you down

1093
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:40,005
and kill you and that
loud mouth bitch.

1094
01:08:40,007 --> 01:08:41,505
- Hey calm down, mother fucker.

1095
01:08:41,507 --> 01:08:42,273
I got shot.

1096
01:08:42,275 --> 01:08:43,040
I'm not going anywhere.

1097
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:44,675
I've got to patch up.

1098
01:08:44,677 --> 01:08:46,844
- [Neeron] Don't you die
before paying me, Jack.

1099
01:08:46,846 --> 01:08:48,445
Or you know what
will happen to that

1100
01:08:48,447 --> 01:08:50,113
sweetheart of yours.

1101
01:08:50,115 --> 01:08:51,715
- You know what, that's
enough of the threats, man.

1102
01:08:51,717 --> 01:08:52,915
We've got some
settling up to do.

1103
01:08:52,917 --> 01:08:54,416
Just stay close to
your fucking phone.

1104
01:08:54,418 --> 01:08:55,818
- Fuck you, Jack.

1105
01:09:11,699 --> 01:09:13,099
- Honey.

1106
01:09:13,101 --> 01:09:14,300
I got everything.

1107
01:09:14,302 --> 01:09:15,134
- Did you get the sling.

1108
01:09:15,136 --> 01:09:17,135
- Mhhmm.

1109
01:09:18,772 --> 01:09:20,338
- Good girl.

1110
01:09:22,276 --> 01:09:24,541
(phone ringing)

1111
01:09:30,882 --> 01:09:32,749
- Hello, sir.

1112
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:35,584
No one's seen any sign of them.

1113
01:09:35,586 --> 01:09:39,554
I'll wait here at the border
till it closes at midnight.

1114
01:09:39,556 --> 01:09:40,888
I'll call you if
anything happens.

1115
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:42,556
- Ok.

1116
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:48,895
You're going to have to
go take care of this.

1117
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,465
Be careful.

1118
01:09:57,605 --> 01:09:59,671
- He's at the border.

1119
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:02,106
Contact all of our
hotel connections.

1120
01:10:02,108 --> 01:10:04,042
Let me know when
you've got something.

1121
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,146
- [Jack] You ready?

1122
01:10:09,148 --> 01:10:10,347
- [Avalon] Yeah.

1123
01:10:10,349 --> 01:10:11,414
- [Jack] Just like we
talked about, all right?

1124
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,815
- Ok.

1125
01:10:12,817 --> 01:10:14,917
(groaning)

1126
01:10:19,156 --> 01:10:22,023
- Put some of that
vodka on the key.

1127
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:24,491
Yeah.

1128
01:10:24,493 --> 01:10:26,360
Now pour some right
on that wound.

1129
01:10:26,362 --> 01:10:28,562
(groaning)

1130
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:32,498
Ok.

1131
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,266
- You ready?

1132
01:10:33,268 --> 01:10:34,300
One.

1133
01:10:34,302 --> 01:10:35,500
Two.

1134
01:10:35,502 --> 01:10:36,201
Three.

1135
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:39,971
(groaning)

1136
01:10:39,973 --> 01:10:41,372
- Avalon, come on, do it.

1137
01:10:41,374 --> 01:10:42,106
You can do it.

1138
01:10:42,108 --> 01:10:43,374
You can do it.

1139
01:10:43,376 --> 01:10:44,475
Do it again.

1140
01:10:44,477 --> 01:10:46,177
Come on.

1141
01:10:46,179 --> 01:10:49,012
- Ok, one.

1142
01:10:49,014 --> 01:10:49,879
Two.

1143
01:10:49,881 --> 01:10:52,382
(groaning)

1144
01:10:52,384 --> 01:10:54,817
I can't do it.

1145
01:10:54,819 --> 01:10:56,985
- Baby, you got to do it.

1146
01:10:56,987 --> 01:10:58,786
You got to do it, Avalon.

1147
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:00,221
Just stick it in there
and pull that bullet out.

1148
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:01,456
- Ok, ok.

1149
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:02,223
- One more time, come on.

1150
01:11:02,225 --> 01:11:02,824
You can do it.

1151
01:11:02,826 --> 01:11:04,692
You can do it.

1152
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:06,126
- Ok.

1153
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:06,693
- Ok.

1154
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:07,861
One.

1155
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:08,695
Two.

1156
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:11,163
(groaning)

1157
01:11:11,165 --> 01:11:13,899
- I'm sorry, I can't
do it, I can't do it.

1158
01:11:15,536 --> 01:11:17,302
- That's ok.

1159
01:11:17,304 --> 01:11:19,404
That's ok.

1160
01:11:19,406 --> 01:11:22,040
- Baby, you have
to see a doctor.

1161
01:11:22,975 --> 01:11:24,875
- Ok.

1162
01:11:24,877 --> 01:11:26,844
Yeah, ok.

1163
01:11:26,846 --> 01:11:29,545
We'll find a vet in Thailand.

1164
01:11:29,547 --> 01:11:32,715
Somebody we can buy off.

1165
01:11:32,717 --> 01:11:36,885
- Well it has to be soon,
you've lost so much blood.

1166
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:41,922
- It's not that much
blood, hey, hey.

1167
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:44,091
We're going to be ok.

1168
01:11:44,093 --> 01:11:45,826
I'm going to be ok, all right?

1169
01:11:45,828 --> 01:11:47,994
You're going to bandage me up

1170
01:11:47,996 --> 01:11:50,997
and I'm going to be
just fine, all right?

1171
01:11:50,999 --> 01:11:52,798
Ok.

1172
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:56,301
- Jack, Jack.

1173
01:12:32,033 --> 01:12:34,766
(gun fire)

1174
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:39,871
(gurgling)

1175
01:12:43,409 --> 01:12:45,943
- Fucking amateur.

1176
01:12:46,812 --> 01:12:48,745
- My brother was right.

1177
01:12:48,747 --> 01:12:50,814
A rat's got no balls.

1178
01:12:54,418 --> 01:12:59,353
(grunting)

1179
01:13:17,337 --> 01:13:20,305
(groaning)

1180
01:13:22,975 --> 01:13:25,976
I always knew it was
you, you fucking snake.

1181
01:13:27,413 --> 01:13:30,746
(groaning)

1182
01:13:41,657 --> 01:13:44,859
Look at me, Neeron.

1183
01:13:44,861 --> 01:13:47,026
I want you to see this coming.

1184
01:13:52,867 --> 01:13:57,035
(groaning)

1185
01:14:05,711 --> 01:14:08,712
- I bet you didn't
see that coming.

1186
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:36,268
- Babe, wake up.

1187
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:38,303
Jack.

1188
01:14:39,706 --> 01:14:41,805
Jack, wake up.

1189
01:14:41,807 --> 01:14:43,841
Jack.

1190
01:14:43,843 --> 01:14:45,809
Jack.

1191
01:14:45,811 --> 01:14:49,812
(groaning)

1192
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:54,216
Are you ok?

1193
01:14:54,218 --> 01:14:57,219
- I feel like shit.

1194
01:14:58,855 --> 01:15:01,822
Babe, we've got to go.

1195
01:15:01,824 --> 01:15:04,925
You drive, ok?

1196
01:15:04,927 --> 01:15:07,894
I'll load the guns.

1197
01:15:09,364 --> 01:15:11,363
- Why do you need
to load the guns?

1198
01:15:11,365 --> 01:15:13,265
We're going home, right?

1199
01:15:13,267 --> 01:15:16,268
- Yeah, we'll go home.

1200
01:15:18,204 --> 01:15:21,005
I just got to take care
of my connection first.

1201
01:15:23,842 --> 01:15:25,509
Hey.

1202
01:15:25,511 --> 01:15:27,411
Baby, it's ok.

1203
01:15:27,413 --> 01:15:29,011
I promise.

1204
01:16:12,049 --> 01:16:14,249
(phone ringing)

1205
01:16:14,251 --> 01:16:15,718
- Hello?

1206
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,118
Jack?

1207
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,753
- There's an old
temple off the highway,

1208
01:16:18,755 --> 01:16:20,922
ten kilometers
west of Siem Reap.

1209
01:16:20,924 --> 01:16:23,824
Be there at one o'clock.

1210
01:16:23,826 --> 01:16:25,492
Not one minute before.

1211
01:16:25,494 --> 01:16:26,960
Not one minute after.

1212
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:28,961
Do you understand?

1213
01:16:28,963 --> 01:16:30,830
- I'll be there.

1214
01:16:45,077 --> 01:16:48,911
- Son of a bitch.

1215
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:55,984
(phone ringing)

1216
01:16:56,687 --> 01:16:57,819
- Yeah?

1217
01:16:57,821 --> 01:16:59,120
- [Lucky] Mr. Cerrancurie.

1218
01:16:59,122 --> 01:17:01,822
I just saw Neeron.

1219
01:17:01,824 --> 01:17:04,191
- Don't let him
out of your sight.

1220
01:17:04,193 --> 01:17:07,861
Tell me exactly where he goes.

1221
01:17:07,863 --> 01:17:10,096
And don't fuck it up.

1222
01:17:10,098 --> 01:17:11,897
- Yes, sir.

1223
01:17:37,788 --> 01:17:40,188
- What now?

1224
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:42,756
- We wait.

1225
01:18:14,518 --> 01:18:16,851
(phone ringing)

1226
01:18:16,853 --> 01:18:18,853
- [Lucky] Mr. Cerrancurie.

1227
01:18:18,855 --> 01:18:19,754
- Where's he headed?

1228
01:18:19,756 --> 01:18:20,855
- [Lucky] Siem Reap temple.

1229
01:18:20,857 --> 01:18:22,489
- I'll take it from here.

1230
01:18:23,892 --> 01:18:25,826
(speaking a foreign language)

1231
01:18:41,674 --> 01:18:43,507
- Be right back.

1232
01:18:43,509 --> 01:18:45,275
- Be careful.

1233
01:18:55,853 --> 01:18:58,419
- Hey Jack, you look like shit.

1234
01:19:02,925 --> 01:19:05,959
I want my money.

1235
01:19:10,698 --> 01:19:13,732
Give me that duffel bag or
I'll shoot that little bitch.

1236
01:19:13,734 --> 01:19:15,667
(gun shots)

1237
01:19:20,039 --> 01:19:21,672
(gun shot)

1238
01:19:28,579 --> 01:19:29,779
- Are you ok?

1239
01:19:29,781 --> 01:19:30,880
- I'm ok.

1240
01:19:30,882 --> 01:19:33,783
He'll never hurt you, baby.

1241
01:19:36,286 --> 01:19:38,286
- He'll never hurt us.

1242
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:49,929
Jack, we need to switch cars.

1243
01:19:49,931 --> 01:19:52,464
- Ok, let's go.

1244
01:20:14,952 --> 01:20:16,651
- Jack?

1245
01:20:16,653 --> 01:20:18,486
- What, doll?

1246
01:20:18,488 --> 01:20:21,222
Oh, shit.

1247
01:20:24,927 --> 01:20:25,992
- That's them in Neeron's car.

1248
01:20:25,994 --> 01:20:27,828
Turn around.

1249
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:30,496
- Just keep driving, baby.

1250
01:20:41,874 --> 01:20:43,674
Faster.

1251
01:20:49,314 --> 01:20:51,747
- We're after that BMW,
don't let them get away.

1252
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,719
- Shit.

1253
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:02,523
Avalon, you give this
bitch all she's got, ok?

1254
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:04,124
Keep your eyes on the
road and don't look back.

1255
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:05,658
- Got it.

1256
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,427
(tires screeching)

1257
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:13,632
- Faster, baby.

1258
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:21,806
Just keep driving.

1259
01:21:24,142 --> 01:21:28,044
(gun shots)

1260
01:21:28,046 --> 01:21:29,879
Can't you go any faster?

1261
01:21:29,881 --> 01:21:31,180
- This is it.

1262
01:21:31,182 --> 01:21:33,883
(gun shots)

1263
01:21:33,885 --> 01:21:35,650
(screaming)

1264
01:21:47,762 --> 01:21:52,831
(gun shots)

1265
01:21:53,667 --> 01:21:57,836
(gun shots)

1266
01:22:03,609 --> 01:22:05,775
- Fuck you, assholes.

1267
01:22:05,777 --> 01:22:09,312
(gun shots)

1268
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:13,782
- Oh my god.

1269
01:22:13,784 --> 01:22:16,684
(gun shots)

1270
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:23,924
(gun shots)

1271
01:22:35,101 --> 01:22:36,734
What now?

1272
01:22:36,736 --> 01:22:38,636
- I don't know.

1273
01:22:38,638 --> 01:22:39,737
Slow down.

1274
01:22:39,739 --> 01:22:40,637
- What?

1275
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,839
- Baby, slow down a little more.

1276
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,647
(gun shots)

1277
01:22:52,649 --> 01:22:57,786
(explosions)

1278
01:22:57,788 --> 01:23:00,287
(tires screeching)

1279
01:23:00,289 --> 01:23:02,723
- God damn it.

1280
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:08,294
(laughing)

1281
01:23:09,431 --> 01:23:10,762
- Did we lose them?

1282
01:23:10,764 --> 01:23:12,130
- For now.

1283
01:23:12,132 --> 01:23:14,599
We should put some
distance between us though.

1284
01:23:14,601 --> 01:23:16,467
I think the border's
a few miles up.

1285
01:23:16,469 --> 01:23:18,169
We'll figure it out there.

1286
01:23:43,692 --> 01:23:46,859
(groaning)

1287
01:23:48,596 --> 01:23:50,696
Ok, baby.

1288
01:23:50,698 --> 01:23:51,864
We're going to ditch the car.

1289
01:23:51,866 --> 01:23:53,865
We can grab a boat
up the river here.

1290
01:23:56,269 --> 01:23:58,802
- Who were those guys, Jack?

1291
01:23:58,804 --> 01:24:01,472
- It's a long story, babe.

1292
01:24:01,474 --> 01:24:03,874
- I thought you were
only hitting banks.

1293
01:24:03,876 --> 01:24:05,808
- Me too.

1294
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:07,377
Turns out these
gangsters launder their

1295
01:24:07,379 --> 01:24:09,445
money through the banks.

1296
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:16,117
Hey, it's ok.

1297
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:18,352
It looks like we're
home free now, huh?

1298
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,797
- Jack, they're here.

1299
01:24:31,799 --> 01:24:33,432
- Fuck.

1300
01:24:35,702 --> 01:24:37,368
Oh, fuck.

1301
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:39,970
- Ok, so what's the plan?

1302
01:24:39,972 --> 01:24:42,672
- Ok, the plan is you're
going to get out of here

1303
01:24:42,674 --> 01:24:45,142
and I'm going to hold
them off as long as I can.

1304
01:24:45,144 --> 01:24:45,709
- No.

1305
01:24:45,711 --> 01:24:46,475
- Baby.

1306
01:24:46,477 --> 01:24:47,643
- No.

1307
01:24:47,645 --> 01:24:48,811
- Look, Avalon,
I've had a life, ok?

1308
01:24:48,813 --> 01:24:50,046
And I spent the best
parts of it with you.

1309
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,647
Baby, back at the
safe there's almost

1310
01:24:51,649 --> 01:24:52,814
a million dollars, ok?

1311
01:24:52,816 --> 01:24:54,416
- Jack, it was never
about the money.

1312
01:24:54,418 --> 01:24:56,651
Can we just give
it back to them?

1313
01:24:56,653 --> 01:24:59,686
- It's past that, babe.

1314
01:24:59,688 --> 01:25:01,722
Ok?

1315
01:25:01,724 --> 01:25:04,090
You got to get on a
boat and you're going to

1316
01:25:04,092 --> 01:25:05,091
take that money
and you're going to

1317
01:25:05,093 --> 01:25:06,492
get out of here.

1318
01:25:06,494 --> 01:25:07,693
You're going to
disappear and get a house

1319
01:25:07,695 --> 01:25:08,861
on an island like
we talked about.

1320
01:25:08,863 --> 01:25:09,928
- No, Jack, please
don't do this.

1321
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:10,829
- Ok, you're going
to buy a house.

1322
01:25:10,831 --> 01:25:11,696
- Please don't do this.

1323
01:25:11,698 --> 01:25:12,531
Please don't do this to me.

1324
01:25:12,533 --> 01:25:14,533
Please, Jack.

1325
01:25:14,535 --> 01:25:16,067
- Baby, I love you.

1326
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:18,569
In this life and the next, ok?

1327
01:25:18,571 --> 01:25:20,204
Ok?

1328
01:25:20,206 --> 01:25:21,572
- I love you too.

1329
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:23,506
- You've got to go.

1330
01:25:23,508 --> 01:25:25,241
Baby, you got to go right now.

1331
01:25:25,243 --> 01:25:27,410
You got to go right
now, go, go, go, go.

1332
01:25:34,884 --> 01:25:38,019
(gun shots)

1333
01:25:44,526 --> 01:25:47,093
(grunting)

1334
01:25:49,597 --> 01:25:53,364
(gun shots)

1335
01:26:07,946 --> 01:26:09,812
(screaming)

1336
01:26:09,814 --> 01:26:12,647
(gun shots)

1337
01:26:12,649 --> 01:26:13,648
- Fuck.

1338
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:16,717
(gun shots)

1339
01:26:38,972 --> 01:26:41,138
Baby, go.

1340
01:26:44,776 --> 01:26:46,408
- Jack.

1341
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,410
No.

1342
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,184
- Are you who killed Neeron?

1343
01:26:56,186 --> 01:26:59,119
- Didn't I do you a favor?

1344
01:26:59,121 --> 01:27:01,355
- Yeah, I'm so
grateful for that.

1345
01:27:01,357 --> 01:27:03,789
- Please don't hurt her.

1346
01:27:03,791 --> 01:27:07,026
- You don't come into people's
yards, steal their money

1347
01:27:07,028 --> 01:27:08,661
and shoot at them.

1348
01:27:08,663 --> 01:27:11,496
There's people like
me who might get lucky

1349
01:27:11,498 --> 01:27:13,665
and kill you first.

1350
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:15,700
- Just don't hurt her, man.

1351
01:27:15,702 --> 01:27:16,467
- Jack.

1352
01:27:16,469 --> 01:27:19,570
No.

1353
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,673
Jack, please don't leave me.

1354
01:27:23,675 --> 01:27:24,541
Please.

1355
01:27:24,543 --> 01:27:26,643
Please, don't leave me.

1356
01:27:26,645 --> 01:27:28,677
- Hey, baby.

1357
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:30,646
- Jack.

1358
01:27:30,648 --> 01:27:32,848
Jack?

1359
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:36,150
Jack?

1360
01:27:36,152 --> 01:27:38,252
Jack?

1361
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:43,690
- You.

1362
01:27:43,692 --> 01:27:47,793
Leave the money, take
your life and go.

1363
01:27:48,996 --> 01:27:50,629
Now.

1364
01:27:56,069 --> 01:27:58,635
- I love you.

1365
01:28:08,913 --> 01:28:12,714
(slow bass music)

1366
01:28:52,949 --> 01:28:54,716
I don't know why Gan
Cerrancurie spared my life

1367
01:28:54,718 --> 01:28:56,818
that day.

1368
01:28:57,853 --> 01:29:00,153
I guess even monsters
have a soft spot.

1369
01:29:01,357 --> 01:29:04,624
Maybe I reminded him
of someone in his life.

1370
01:29:04,626 --> 01:29:08,861
Compassion still lived
in him somewhere.

1371
01:29:10,397 --> 01:29:13,198
I'm grateful I lived a
fairy tale with Jack.

1372
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:16,133
If only for a short time.

1373
01:29:16,135 --> 01:29:19,370
But the price was too high,

1374
01:29:19,372 --> 01:29:21,638
and I would give all
the money in the world

1375
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,840
to see Jack again.

1376
01:29:25,644 --> 01:29:27,943
Now, Jack lives on.

1377
01:29:27,945 --> 01:29:30,712
But only in my heart.

1378
01:29:48,963 --> 01:29:49,963
(slow bass music)

1378
01:29:50,305 --> 01:30:50,467
