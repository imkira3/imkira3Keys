2
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,591
All right,
we're good to go.

3
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:02,511
You got this? You bet your ass, bubba.

4
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:05,013
Let's make some money!

5
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,396
Everyone in position.

6
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:17,067
I thought we'd be
robbing banks by now,

7
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:19,528
not some gas truck
in the middle of nowhere.

8
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,281
Down here, gas is gold, bubba.

9
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,041
Kill the chatter!
Game time.

10
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,460
I wouldn't piss him off, guys.

11
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:58,358
Okay, guys, we're gonna have
to hit this hard and fast.

12
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:01,278
We got four K left
before the downgrade.

13
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:24,217
Locked and loaded!

14
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,120
This is all you, Han.

15
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:59,211
Liquid gold.

16
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:07,552
We're clear.

17
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:08,804
Okay, T, you're up.

18
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,894
Let's see if you can get it
under six tries this time, huh, T?

19
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:22,234
It's more like three. Come
on, Tego, keep it real.

20
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:42,421
Just one K left. We're running
out of road. Get in there, brother.

21
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,339
I got it, I got it.

22
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:54,808
Shit!

23
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,899
T, cut loose!
Unhitch, unhitch!

24
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:52,157
Spray that hitch!
I don't have a hammer!

25
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:53,742
Just do it!

26
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:09,758
Hold on! Hold on!

27
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,343
No shit!

28
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,722
Hold onto
something tight!

29
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:40,872
Letty!

30
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:43,208
Give me your hand!
I can't reach!

31
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,960
You got to jump!

32
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:12,362
Jump!

33
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:15,365
Letty, jump!

34
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,496
I've got you!

35
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:55,905
Dom...

36
00:06:58,326 --> 00:06:59,451
Dom?

37
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,706
Dom!

38
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,070
How you doing?

39
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:20,323
Money, money!

40
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:22,826
Good.

41
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:27,372
Yo, why your stack
is bigger than mine always?

42
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:29,290
I'm supersized,
baby.

43
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:41,928
Cops just raided
our garage in Baracoa.

44
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,265
They were real
interested in you.

45
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,603
Heat's on and we just sent up a flare
that's gonna lead them right to us.

46
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:53,773
I say we move out first
thing in the morning.

47
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:57,193
Nah, it's me they want.

48
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,779
And if they catch me,

49
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:02,866
they're throwing big
numbers at anybody with me.

50
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:07,996
Han, we had a good run.

51
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,751
Time for you to go
do your own thing.

52
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:19,674
Heard they're doing
some crazy shit in Tokyo.

53
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:27,891
Have you seen Letty?

54
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,280
There she is.

55
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,997
I hear Rio is nice
this time of year.

56
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,920
The cops are
getting hungrier.

57
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:59,422
Then I guess we're doing our job.

58
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:06,137
I'm a walking target.

59
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:10,016
I don't want you around
when they catch up to me.

60
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:14,604
"Ride or die,"
remember?

61
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:18,733
Dom, how long have we been doing this?

62
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:24,572
And now all of a sudden, out
of nowhere, it's too dangerous?

63
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:26,741
Come on.

64
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:34,833
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

65
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:03,041
I don't know shit!
Give me a name!

66
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,209
I don't know shit, man!
Give me a name!

67
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:08,296
David Park! David
Park's the guy you want!

68
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,006
Please!

69
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:21,017
Thank God. Listen, he's in a mood
because yesterday was his cheat day,

70
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,061
and then today, some
genius brought in donuts.

71
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:24,353
Great.

72
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:27,273
Sorry I'm late.

73
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:32,904
Complaints keep rolling in after your
little downtown Olympics, O'Conner.

74
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:36,157
Tell me that reinstating
you wasn't a mistake.

75
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:39,410
I got a name. David Park. That's it?

76
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:41,954
That's all you got?
David Park?

77
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,916
I could throw a fortune cookie out this
window and hit 50 David Parks right now.

78
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,668
It's Korean, not Chinese. Whatever.

79
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:52,924
Park is a scout that recruits street
racers to be mules for the Braga cartel.

80
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:55,593
We find Park, and we bust the bad guys.

81
00:15:20,577 --> 00:15:21,911
Dom.

82
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:24,664
Mia, I told you
not to call me here.

83
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:26,874
Dom, it's Letty.

84
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,669
She's been murdered.

85
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:49,814
We have gathered here
to pay our final respects to...

86
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:53,067
Let us reflect
on her journey...

87
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:01,534
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
not want. He makes me lie down... "

88
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:24,182
Facial recognition software
matched Toretto

89
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,100
about 10 minutes after
he crossed the border.

90
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,688
I don't get it.

91
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:32,773
I thought he'd show.

92
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:30,289
I told you not to come.
They're staking the place out.

93
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:32,833
If they find you...
They won't.

94
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:38,839
Come on.
Look at you.

95
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,576
Letty wouldn't
let them junk it.

96
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,747
Even though it is
a goddamn curse.

97
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:17,503
When she came back,
she was always in here,

98
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:21,048
working on it
day and night.

99
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,306
It was weird.

100
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:32,893
It was like she knew
you were coming back.

101
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:37,273
I want to see
the crash site.

102
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:46,365
I just got off the
phone with Deputy Director Lawson.

103
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:50,494
If we don't make serious inroads into
the Braga case in the next 72 hours,

104
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:52,830
they're gonna
shut us down.

105
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,542
I know I'm a newbie here,
but why the clock now?

106
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:58,419
Because it's been
two years,

107
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:01,005
and the last three agents we sent
to infiltrate his organization

108
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:03,466
came back in body bags.

109
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:08,137
He's moved more heroin across the
border than Escobar did in 10 years.

110
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:11,015
This guy is becoming one of
our biggest national threats,

111
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:13,184
and we don't even
have a picture of him.

112
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:16,771
We don't have prints!
Not even a goddamn DOB!

113
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:22,026
What's the status
on David Park?

114
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,320
Isn't he our ticket into
the Braga organization?

115
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:28,199
We're running the name through city and
county databases, sorting the possibilities.

116
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:30,201
We've got
over 500 already.

117
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:33,329
Park's insignificant. Sounds
like another jerk-off to me.

118
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:37,375
It's not. Without Park, Braga
wouldn't have drivers to move his shipments.

119
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:40,211
Cross-check traffic.
lllegal modifications.

120
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:44,632
Street racing. This guy will definitely
have a record. We'll find him.

121
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:46,926
We better.

122
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:49,261
What do you know?

123
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:53,015
Your boy Toretto's red Chevelle has
been spotted in his old neighborhood.

124
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,892
I'm going to
bring his ass in.

125
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,228
Not in your car
you're not.

126
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,863
It's straight ahead.

127
00:22:13,615 --> 00:22:15,950
You found something
back there.

128
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,457
There were burn marks
on the ground.

129
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:29,797
The kind that could only
be caused by nitrometh.

130
00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:36,804
There's only one guy in
all of L.A. that sells that.

131
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,019
Nothing you can do is
gonna bring her back, Dom.

132
00:22:46,106 --> 00:22:48,399
If I were Letty,
I would ask you...

133
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:52,069
No, I would beg you,
please, let this go.

134
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,322
Before it's too late.

135
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:01,745
It's already too late.

136
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:08,711
I love you.

137
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:17,196
Miss Toretto.

138
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:20,449
I'm Michael Stasiak, FBl.

139
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,577
Let's you and I
have a little chat.

140
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,935
Hi. This is Forsythe
in Evidence.

141
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,647
I need Stasiak down here right
away to sign some greenies.

142
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:53,232
Thanks.

143
00:24:53,316 --> 00:24:54,858
Hi.
Hey.

144
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:57,528
Okay, I narrowed it down
to 50 or so David Parks.

145
00:24:57,612 --> 00:24:59,988
What I'd like you to do is run the
make and model on each one of them.

146
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:01,031
All right?
Okay. All right.

147
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:02,366
Thank you.

148
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:15,295
Hey, Tyler,
we got a transfer.

149
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:19,508
You want to
come with me?

150
00:25:40,947 --> 00:25:42,197
Toretto.

151
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:45,075
When'd you get
back in town?

152
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,036
I'm looking for a car
you did an engine mod on.

153
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:52,624
Nitromethane tank. Ford
full-size. Continental tires.

154
00:25:54,544 --> 00:25:57,880
Look, what are you doing,
coming in here like this, huh?

155
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:01,091
This ain't your scene
anymore, boss.

156
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:03,886
Don't ever put your hands
on me again, okay?

157
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,305
Say hi to your
sister for me.

158
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:21,195
A Korean kid brought it in. David Park.

159
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,364
It's a green Ford Torino.

160
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,701
Please don't
drop this on me!

161
00:26:32,582 --> 00:26:34,291
I'm almost done.

162
00:26:36,586 --> 00:26:40,047
Why don't you tell me why
you dragged me here, Brian?

163
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:50,057
You know they're going to
capture Dom. Maybe worse.

164
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:56,063
I don't want you getting tangled
up in this. So stay away from him.

165
00:26:56,981 --> 00:27:00,359
That's what you have to
say to me after five years?

166
00:27:01,736 --> 00:27:04,571
All of a sudden, you
care what happens to me.

167
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:10,327
What I did to you
was wrong.

168
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:14,706
I'm sorry. It was... It was the
hardest thing I've ever had to do.

169
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,085
I'm sorry, too, Brian.

170
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:23,465
I'm so sorry that you had to come
into my home and pretend to love me.

171
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,926
I'm so sorry that you
ripped my family apart.

172
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,929
I'm very sorry that
that was hard for you.

173
00:27:32,642 --> 00:27:34,268
I lied to you.

174
00:27:35,728 --> 00:27:38,272
I lied to Dom.
I lied to everybody.

175
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:42,025
That's what I do best. It's
why the Feds recruited me.

176
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,071
Maybe you're lying
to yourself.

177
00:27:47,323 --> 00:27:51,034
Maybe you're not the good guy
pretending to be a bad guy.

178
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:54,872
Maybe you're the bad guy
pretending to be the good guy.

179
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:57,124
You ever think about that?

180
00:27:58,751 --> 00:28:00,252
Every day.

181
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,474
I always wondered,

182
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:19,479
why did you let
my brother go that day?

183
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:22,482
I don't know.

184
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,827
Shit.

185
00:28:36,956 --> 00:28:37,956
Brian!

186
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:41,043
I got the cross-checks on David Park
back and have a list of possibles.

187
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:43,587
What do you got? All right. A
45-year-old male in a '06 Scion

188
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:45,756
with three reckless driving tickets. No.

189
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,216
An '01 Chevy Tahoe.
No.

190
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:52,137
Two Mini Coopers, a '06
and a '07, a Toyota hybrid.

191
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:54,890
Hell no. A '98 Saturn, a '95 Sebring.

192
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:57,100
A '98 Nissan 240
with an illegal mod.

193
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:59,186
Wait. That's it.

194
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,772
What? The 240 with the illegal mod.

195
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:05,150
How do you know? 'Cause
that's something I'd drive.

196
00:29:29,592 --> 00:29:31,051
Don't! Don't! Don't!

197
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:45,399
Green Torino,
running nitro.

198
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,026
Whose car?
I don't know, man.

199
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:51,113
I'm just the middleman. I
swear! I'm just the middleman!

200
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:57,661
Wait, wait, wait.

201
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:02,040
I don't know shit, man. I swear. I
just run cars for Braga, all right?

202
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,918
All I can do is get you in
the race! That's all I can do!

203
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,378
What race?

204
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,593
Help! Come on,
hold on!

205
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,054
Let me up, man!
Come on!

206
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:30,068
Come on, man, I don't
know shit! Just let me up!

207
00:30:30,153 --> 00:30:32,320
I told you, you got to talk to Braga!

208
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:33,363
Bring him up, Dom.

209
00:30:33,448 --> 00:30:36,158
God! Don't drop me!
That's all I know!

210
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:38,744
Bring him up.

211
00:30:38,828 --> 00:30:41,329
You here to take
me in, O'Conner?

212
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:44,332
Shit! Shit!
Shut up!

213
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:48,920
Letty was my friend, too.

214
00:30:49,005 --> 00:30:50,630
You weren't
anyone's friend.

215
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,842
Yo, can you guys talk about
this later? Now pull my ass up!

216
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:56,219
She was running for this guy,
Braga, and things went bad.

217
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:57,345
Please!

218
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,057
I'm going to
get these guys, Dom.

219
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:02,350
Now let me do my job
and bring him up.

220
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:04,895
I'm going to
kill this Braga.

221
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:08,023
God!

222
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:11,193
And anyone else
who gets in my way.

223
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:16,656
Hey!

224
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:18,867
Don't let go.

225
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,044
O'Conner!

226
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:34,466
O'Conner! If you ever release
a witness of mine again...

227
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:40,764
That's enough! STASIAK: Don't touch me.

228
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:42,265
I'm fine! PENNING: That's enough.

229
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,560
You're through, O'Conner!
I said that's enough!

230
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:48,605
Stasiak, go get
yourself cleaned up.

231
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,941
What?
He hit me first! You...

232
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:53,026
This isn't
the Cub Scouts!

233
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,363
Now, go on! You're bleeding on my floor.

234
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,792
O'Conner, do you know the difference
between a cop and a criminal?

235
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:11,294
What?
One bad judgment call.

236
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,965
Keep your shit in line,
son.

237
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:20,679
Have a good time.

238
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:25,350
Take a seat.

239
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:33,900
Good news. We have intel that
Braga's number two, Ramon Campos,

240
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,153
will hold a street race
in Koreatown tomorrow night

241
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:38,405
to fill a slot
on his team.

242
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:41,616
They've already chosen three
drivers from previous races.

243
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:45,245
Our newest informant,
Mr. David Park,

244
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:48,081
has been kind enough
to get us into the race.

245
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:52,794
O'Conner, you're up.

246
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:56,214
Let me guess,
winner gets the slot.

247
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:04,514
All right, so these are all the
imports the city has in impound.

248
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,725
Okay, nice.
Pick your poison.

249
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:10,020
All right, 2206.
I crashed one of those.

250
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:14,774
3418 and 2765.

251
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,069
Okay, so which one
do you want?

252
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:19,863
I want them all.

253
00:33:49,852 --> 00:33:51,645
Standard issue
tracking device.

254
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,647
Boss wants to know where
you are at all times.

255
00:34:46,158 --> 00:34:47,367
You want to
play with it?

256
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:49,494
Hey!

257
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,289
What are you
looking at, nutsack?

258
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,124
I don't know.
You tell me.

259
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:56,459
The racer wants
what Dwight's got.

260
00:34:56,544 --> 00:34:59,504
See, but, ladies, Dwight's
already on the team.

261
00:34:59,588 --> 00:35:01,548
You got to be fast if you
want to drive for Braga.

262
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,467
Is there a problem here? No.

263
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,972
You one of
Park's guys, blondie?

264
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:10,557
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

265
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,767
Follow me.

266
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:17,897
See you later, punk.

267
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:19,899
You, too, punk.

268
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:34,414
Bull's-eye, coÃ±o,
come on!

269
00:35:40,463 --> 00:35:41,671
We can do this all day.

270
00:35:46,886 --> 00:35:49,220
You all know
why you're here.

271
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:51,389
Good drivers

272
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:54,851
are a dime a dozen.

273
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:59,564
Man, every corner's got a
chingadera tuner racing for pinks.

274
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:03,401
That's not what Braga
has got me looking for.

275
00:36:03,986 --> 00:36:08,656
Braga wants someone that would sell
their abuelita to be behind the wheel.

276
00:36:10,242 --> 00:36:14,329
Someone that drives their 10-second
cars not in a straight line,

277
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:18,625
but to push it and make it through
places no one else would take it.

278
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:20,919
Real drivers.

279
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,131
So, what are we hauling?

280
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:29,552
For the money Braga's paying,
you don't need to know.

281
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:32,305
You just said you wanted real drivers.

282
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,477
A real driver knows
exactly what's in his car.

283
00:36:42,525 --> 00:36:44,317
Mira, real driver,

284
00:36:46,195 --> 00:36:48,405
nobody's forcing you
to race.

285
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:50,240
You the boss?

286
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,285
Or am I talking
to the boss?

287
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,165
Do I look like a boss?

288
00:37:01,377 --> 00:37:04,921
My job is to find the
best drivers, period.

289
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:08,675
Whoever wins the race
gets the info. We cool?

290
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:15,140
Are we cool?

291
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:19,018
Yeah, we're cool.

292
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,521
No,
we ain't cool, man.

293
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:24,399
Who's closing these streets?

294
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:28,778
No one.
That's the point.

295
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,918
Please wait while
directions are downloaded.

296
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:52,135
Proceed to
the highlighted route.

297
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,012
Ten,

298
00:37:55,723 --> 00:37:56,931
nine,

299
00:37:58,517 --> 00:37:59,767
eight,

300
00:38:01,437 --> 00:38:02,687
seven,

301
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,231
six...

302
00:38:05,274 --> 00:38:08,568
You sure you want to do
this? A lot has changed.

303
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:11,362
...four...
You're right.

304
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:13,406
...three,

305
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,117
two,

306
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,786
one,

307
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:21,331
go!

308
00:38:29,715 --> 00:38:31,424
Right turn ahead.

309
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:37,931
You are now five miles
from your destination.

310
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:05,792
How's my ass look,
Chia Pet?

311
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:08,169
Ghetto Smurf.

312
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:34,988
Dead man driving.

313
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:39,909
Come on!

314
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:42,996
Right turn ahead.

315
00:40:01,974 --> 00:40:03,141
Shit!

316
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,731
Damn.

317
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:19,657
Rerouting.

318
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,460
Proceed straight ahead.

319
00:40:34,757 --> 00:40:36,132
Rerouting.

320
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:47,143
Shit.

321
00:40:48,604 --> 00:40:50,813
Rerouting.
Just shut up!

322
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:58,029
You are 2.6 miles
from destination.

323
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:02,617
Oops, I didn't see you.

324
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,082
You are now four and one-half
miles from your destination.

325
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:44,659
U- turn, if possible.
Are you kidding me?

326
00:41:44,743 --> 00:41:48,788
You are now 4.2 miles
from your destination.

327
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:52,041
Sorry, car.

328
00:41:59,341 --> 00:42:01,843
You are now one mile
from your destination.

329
00:42:01,927 --> 00:42:04,137
Yeah,
guess who's back, Dom?

330
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,391
Let's go!

331
00:42:12,855 --> 00:42:14,480
Nice car, baby!

332
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:00,359
Bitch!

333
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:04,781
You are now one-quarter
mile from your destination.

334
00:43:23,425 --> 00:43:25,051
Too early, Dom.

335
00:43:44,279 --> 00:43:45,321
No!

336
00:43:45,906 --> 00:43:47,698
Still a buster.

337
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,247
You have reached your
destination. Goodbye.

338
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:09,303
At least we know you
can't beat me straight up.

339
00:44:09,388 --> 00:44:11,180
I didn't know
there were any rules.

340
00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:14,851
Now that's what I call
real driving.

341
00:44:14,935 --> 00:44:16,310
No, that's bullshit, man!

342
00:44:16,395 --> 00:44:18,354
Go cry to your mama, eh?

343
00:44:20,774 --> 00:44:22,775
You work for Braga now.

344
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,987
When the GPS calls,
you follow.

345
00:44:30,993 --> 00:44:32,785
Driver's license.

346
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,454
What driver's license?

347
00:44:35,998 --> 00:44:37,540
Thumb.

348
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:44,005
Cell phone number.

349
00:44:49,094 --> 00:44:51,304
The print is for Campos.

350
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:53,848
The number is for me.

351
00:44:57,311 --> 00:44:58,686
Yo, nutsack!

352
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,356
Let me tell you something, man,
muscle beats import every time.

353
00:45:02,441 --> 00:45:05,234
You know what I'm saying? Every time!

354
00:45:06,111 --> 00:45:09,155
Ladies, let's get on
back to Papa Dwight's.

355
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:18,831
Papa Dwight wants you
to take off your shoes.

356
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:22,460
Dwight likes feet.
Take off your shoes.

357
00:45:23,378 --> 00:45:24,921
So beautiful.

358
00:45:27,049 --> 00:45:29,050
Dwight likes this foot a lot.

359
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:38,768
Yes, baby!

360
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:42,146
Daddy Dwight loves...
FBl!

361
00:45:44,024 --> 00:45:47,068
I didn't do nothing, man!
Dwight didn't do nothing!

362
00:45:47,194 --> 00:45:49,654
Hey, no! Stay, stay! Where
you going? Bye, Dwight!

363
00:45:49,738 --> 00:45:50,947
No, what did I do?

364
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:54,241
You're under arrest
for distribution of meth.

365
00:45:54,326 --> 00:45:57,662
Meth? Dwight's never
touched that shit, bro!

366
00:45:57,746 --> 00:45:58,788
Dwight has now.

367
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:01,248
Yo, that ain't mine! No!

368
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,459
You know that's never
gonna stick, right?

369
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:05,795
Yeah, it's not
supposed to.

370
00:46:08,548 --> 00:46:10,466
Live it up!
Live it up!

371
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:07,440
Yeah, Corona.

372
00:47:10,444 --> 00:47:11,819
That's too bad
about Dwight.

373
00:47:11,903 --> 00:47:15,364
Having the Feds raid your house
the same night you make the team.

374
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:17,450
So unfortunate.

375
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,953
I wish I could say I was
surprised to see you here.

376
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:25,791
What's to stop someone from
telling them you're a cop?

377
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:29,628
Probably the same thing that's keeping me
from telling them why you're really here.

378
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,922
What up, fellows?
Hey, how you doing?

379
00:47:32,007 --> 00:47:34,675
Great. You having a good
time? Yeah, a great time.

380
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,303
Come on, let's have a better time.

381
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:41,390
How's your car?
It took a nasty bump.

382
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:43,017
It'll be ready.

383
00:47:43,101 --> 00:47:46,437
I also heard you just
got out of County.

384
00:47:46,521 --> 00:47:48,105
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

385
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,191
You know a guy
named Jim Garcia?

386
00:47:50,275 --> 00:47:54,320
Nah. Big place. Lots
of names, lots of faces.

387
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:58,866
And you, you're wanted by
a lot of people, homes.

388
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,535
Yeah, that kind of heat
can't be good for business.

389
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,538
Yeah, well, that depends
on how you look at things.

390
00:48:04,623 --> 00:48:06,999
I go down, I do time.

391
00:48:08,043 --> 00:48:09,710
I do real time.

392
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:15,299
I don't know about your other drivers, but
when I see flashing lights in my mirror,

393
00:48:15,383 --> 00:48:16,884
I don't stop.

394
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:24,266
Do you know each other?

395
00:48:28,355 --> 00:48:30,523
He used to date
my sister.

396
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:32,942
I see.

397
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:37,905
You're a lucky man.
How's that?

398
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,950
You're still breathing.

399
00:48:46,998 --> 00:48:51,043
To the ladies we've loved
and the ladies we've lost.

400
00:48:59,761 --> 00:49:01,804
So, what's Braga about?

401
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:05,599
You know,
he's just one of us.

402
00:49:05,684 --> 00:49:09,145
Came up from the streets.
Down for el barrio.

403
00:49:09,229 --> 00:49:11,438
Now he's a shot caller.

404
00:49:12,274 --> 00:49:14,150
The boss of bosses.

405
00:49:14,776 --> 00:49:17,069
See all these
cats in here?

406
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,322
Any one of them
would die for Braga.

407
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:22,032
Including you?

408
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,786
Especially me.

409
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:37,339
Enjoy the party, fellows.
Club's yours.

410
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:40,676
Whatever you want, booze,
broads, it's all good.

411
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:45,639
Braga's mine.

412
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:51,604
I'm taking the
whole house down.

413
00:49:52,397 --> 00:49:53,772
Good luck.

414
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:04,278
Something interests you
about this car?

415
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:07,156
Just admiring
the body work.

416
00:52:08,742 --> 00:52:12,745
Are you one of those boys
who prefers cars to women?

417
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:20,919
I'm one of those boys that appreciates
a fine body, regardless of the make.

418
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:26,050
Your car?

419
00:52:30,096 --> 00:52:31,764
It's Fenix's car.

420
00:52:32,974 --> 00:52:37,061
You'll meet him at the
rendezvous. He'll be leading you.

421
00:52:38,563 --> 00:52:39,938
So now

422
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,734
that I know
your taste in cars,

423
00:52:43,818 --> 00:52:46,362
tell me, what about your women?

424
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,532
It all starts
with the eyes.

425
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:58,207
She's got to have those kind of eyes
that can look right through the bullshit

426
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:00,417
to the good in someone.

427
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:08,217
20% angel,
80% devil.

428
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,720
Down to earth.

429
00:53:13,556 --> 00:53:17,726
Ain't afraid to get a little
engine grease under her fingernails.

430
00:53:24,692 --> 00:53:27,319
That doesn't sound
anything like me.

431
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:31,323
It ain't.

432
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,416
Hi.
Hi.

433
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,585
I got a gift for you.
All right.

434
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,213
A dirty shot glass,
just what I always wanted.

435
00:53:46,297 --> 00:53:47,881
I got these from the club last night.

436
00:53:47,966 --> 00:53:49,925
There's two sets of
prints here. Run them both.

437
00:53:50,009 --> 00:53:53,512
I know one of these is Campos'. I
think the other might be Braga's.

438
00:53:53,596 --> 00:53:56,140
And you're gonna have
to go beyond Interpol.

439
00:53:56,224 --> 00:53:58,600
So, that means I have to
contact individual agencies,

440
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:01,228
and that could
take weeks. Okay.

441
00:54:16,327 --> 00:54:17,286
Yeah.

442
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:20,539
That's your third traffic
violation in less than three blocks.

443
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:22,624
Slow it down,
O'Conner.

444
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,002
Sure thing, Dad.

445
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:55,157
He stopped.

446
00:55:49,796 --> 00:55:51,213
We lost him.

447
00:55:51,297 --> 00:55:52,798
He killed the tracker.
We don't know that.

448
00:55:52,924 --> 00:55:55,133
I'm telling you, he killed the
tracker. We don't know that yet!

449
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,135
Get the bird overhead.

450
00:55:58,263 --> 00:56:01,306
Right now, I'm moving north, 33', 56'...

451
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:06,687
All clear.

452
00:56:29,627 --> 00:56:31,920
Base, flag nine,
I'm at Angels 5.

453
00:56:32,005 --> 00:56:35,632
I don't have a tally on the target.
Repeat, I don't have a tally on the target.

454
00:56:35,717 --> 00:56:37,426
They're gone, there's no one down there.

455
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,844
Damn it!

456
00:56:49,897 --> 00:56:54,693
This ain't right, bro. Nobody said
nothing about being locked in no truck.

457
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:56,528
Tell me about it.

458
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,033
Hey. Hey!

459
00:57:02,744 --> 00:57:05,787
Yo! Where do you think
they're taking us?

460
00:57:05,872 --> 00:57:07,456
Don't matter.

461
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:13,211
We're all just along
for the ride now.

462
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:26,308
Welcome to Mexico, boys.

463
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:34,441
There are helicopters
and surveillance cameras

464
00:57:34,525 --> 00:57:36,985
that scan for heat
signatures at the border.

465
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:41,031
But there are blind spots that I
can guide you through via satellite.

466
00:57:41,115 --> 00:57:45,619
There can be no margin of error, so
you must follow my every direction.

467
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,704
Any questions?

468
00:57:49,749 --> 00:57:52,292
I thought Fenix
was gonna be here.

469
00:57:55,463 --> 00:57:57,547
He'll meet you
out there.

470
00:58:02,428 --> 00:58:04,763
All right, everybody, sync up.

471
00:58:07,558 --> 00:58:09,434
Good luck, gentlemen.

472
00:58:22,865 --> 00:58:24,449
Satellite linkup engaged.

473
00:58:25,785 --> 00:58:28,829
Keep proceeding northbound
at current speed.

474
00:58:32,792 --> 00:58:34,668
Stay close to Fenix.

475
00:58:35,837 --> 00:58:37,295
He'll lead you across.

476
00:58:51,477 --> 00:58:55,021
I got a heat signature
northbound along Legardo Ravine.

477
00:58:57,483 --> 00:59:02,028
Thermal imaging window on the Mexico
side's gonna be down for about 45 seconds.

478
00:59:02,113 --> 00:59:03,989
Get the camera on it.

479
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:07,909
Manual override. Rerouting
camera to designated coordinates.

480
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,874
Hurry it up.
You guys have been tagged.

481
00:59:23,676 --> 00:59:25,010
Shit.

482
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:28,597
Toretto,
get back in formation.

483
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:32,851
Reimaging commencing.

484
00:59:41,652 --> 00:59:43,570
I don't see anything.

485
00:59:43,654 --> 00:59:44,863
They're gone.

486
00:59:46,908 --> 00:59:48,867
Get the helicopters
to cover it.

487
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:56,082
Base, we're 40 seconds
out from Legardo Ravine.

488
00:59:56,959 --> 00:59:58,585
They're sending
a helicopter.

489
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:02,088
You have 30 seconds.

490
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:14,017
North 32' 33',
west 116' 49'.

491
01:00:20,525 --> 01:00:22,317
The window
is closing fast.

492
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:25,570
You need to get out of there
before they send ground support.

493
01:00:31,786 --> 01:00:33,453
Fifteen seconds.

494
01:00:38,918 --> 01:00:41,253
Base,
target is at two miles.

495
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:56,643
You're running
out of time.

496
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,773
You need to get out now!

497
01:01:13,744 --> 01:01:17,747
Base, we're at north
32' 33', west 116' 49'.

498
01:01:17,832 --> 01:01:21,710
We have no visuaI contact. Roll
ground units for confirmation.

499
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:43,982
Sloppy!

500
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:46,192
Very sloppy!

501
01:01:51,824 --> 01:01:53,867
What are you doing, man?

502
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,704
Come on.

503
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:02,167
Get out.

504
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:06,880
Come on, man.

505
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:08,924
Come on, today, man.
Come on, let's go.

506
01:02:09,008 --> 01:02:10,884
Hey, don't touch me.
Hey, don't touch me, man!

507
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,970
Hey, I said don't touch me, man!

508
01:02:14,055 --> 01:02:15,597
Hey, look, dawg, don't
put your hands on me.

509
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:17,182
Hey,
Malik, chill, bro.

510
01:02:17,308 --> 01:02:18,516
Yo, man, what's up
with your boy?

511
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:20,477
Hey, boss man!

512
01:02:23,397 --> 01:02:25,106
What did you say?

513
01:02:25,191 --> 01:02:28,944
I said only pussies
run nitrometh.

514
01:02:31,572 --> 01:02:33,657
You looked under my hood?

515
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:42,248
I'm talking to you.

516
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:44,542
Got something on your mind?

517
01:02:45,378 --> 01:02:46,711
'70 Plymouth.

518
01:02:49,715 --> 01:02:51,007
Her name was Letty.

519
01:02:54,136 --> 01:02:55,220
Yo.

520
01:02:56,764 --> 01:02:58,515
Where's my money?

521
01:03:00,226 --> 01:03:02,560
And somebody
wrecked her car.

522
01:03:10,361 --> 01:03:11,611
I wrecked her car.

523
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,242
You remember her face?

524
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:23,999
Huh?

525
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,501
'Cause I don't.

526
01:03:27,878 --> 01:03:30,547
Last time I saw it,
it was burning.

527
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:45,729
Now what?

528
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:50,108
I'm going to enjoy
what happens next.

529
01:04:24,185 --> 01:04:25,685
Dom, get in!

530
01:04:26,979 --> 01:04:28,646
Get in! Come on!

531
01:04:30,649 --> 01:04:34,486
Come on! Get in the fucking
car! Let's go! Hurry up!

532
01:05:01,472 --> 01:05:03,098
What
have you got, Trinh?

533
01:05:03,182 --> 01:05:05,767
We're contacting agencies
in multiple countries.

534
01:05:05,851 --> 01:05:10,855
Unfortunately, most of them have to
manually scan their prints for us to upload.

535
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,775
O'Conner's on line five.

536
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:15,944
And, sir,
you should see this.

537
01:05:16,028 --> 01:05:17,529
Thank you.

538
01:05:27,915 --> 01:05:29,040
Talk to me, O'Conner.

539
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,668
Where the hell have you
been? I got the shipment.

540
01:05:31,752 --> 01:05:34,754
"I got the shipment,"
or "we got the shipment"?

541
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:36,881
What are you
talking about?

542
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:41,427
Traffic cams in the area picked up
pictures of you and Toretto together.

543
01:05:42,555 --> 01:05:47,308
Listen to me, O'Conner. Bring in
the shipment and bring in Toretto.

544
01:05:47,726 --> 01:05:50,395
But I thought the point was to get
Braga. We got an opportunity here.

545
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:53,064
Brian, the clock
stopped ticking.

546
01:05:53,941 --> 01:05:56,234
Bring them in.
Are we clear?

547
01:06:00,573 --> 01:06:01,906
O'Conner?

548
01:06:11,917 --> 01:06:14,752
So this is what
$60 million looks like.

549
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:19,132
Yeah, we got to
get you to a doctor.

550
01:06:19,216 --> 01:06:21,885
We got to find
a place to hide this.

551
01:06:24,471 --> 01:06:25,638
I got a spot.

552
01:06:35,733 --> 01:06:38,651
502, wet reckless.
I need a 48-hour hold.

553
01:06:40,779 --> 01:06:42,614
Out back.
Any spot you can find.

554
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:49,662
You sure about this?

555
01:06:50,623 --> 01:06:56,794
Yeah. The last place they'll check,
their own impound yard. Trust me.

556
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:05,178
You know,
I've been thinking,

557
01:07:05,262 --> 01:07:07,722
when you blew up your car back
there, you blew up mine, too.

558
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:10,308
Yeah?
Yeah.

559
01:07:10,392 --> 01:07:12,977
So now you owe me
a 10-second car.

560
01:07:14,313 --> 01:07:16,564
Is that right?
Yeah.

561
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:29,535
Now we're even.

562
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:48,096
Is this your way of
keeping me away from him?

563
01:07:48,222 --> 01:07:52,058
You're the only one I could
call. He's my brother, of course.

564
01:07:59,692 --> 01:08:01,776
The bullet's not in there.

565
01:08:09,326 --> 01:08:13,288
I'm gonna clean it and stitch
it up. It's going to hurt.

566
01:08:13,372 --> 01:08:15,832
I bet you're going
to enjoy this.

567
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,834
A little.

568
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:23,214
Want some of this?
Yeah.

569
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:25,341
It's spicy.

570
01:08:27,094 --> 01:08:28,720
I like it hot.

571
01:08:29,847 --> 01:08:32,056
Dom, what are you doing?

572
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:35,059
You reached first,
you have to say grace.

573
01:08:45,362 --> 01:08:49,240
Thank you, Lord,
for blessing this table.

574
01:08:50,701 --> 01:08:55,455
With food, family
and friendship.

575
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,532
You asked me
why I let Dom go.

576
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:36,287
I think it's because
at that moment,

577
01:09:37,998 --> 01:09:40,833
I respected him
more than I did myself.

578
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:46,422
Yeah.

579
01:09:48,008 --> 01:09:53,137
One thing I learned from Dom is that nothing
really matters unless you have a code.

580
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:58,643
And what's your code,
Brian?

581
01:10:01,021 --> 01:10:02,814
I'm working on it.

582
01:10:37,683 --> 01:10:39,225
Shit. Hey, Dom.

583
01:10:39,351 --> 01:10:41,894
When were you gonna tell
me? Dom, what are you doing?

584
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:43,938
When were you gonna tell me
you were running Letty?

585
01:10:44,022 --> 01:10:46,357
Let me explain...
When were you gonna...

586
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,072
Dom, stop!

587
01:10:53,157 --> 01:10:55,324
You don't understand.
I don't understand?

588
01:10:55,409 --> 01:10:56,617
Stop!

589
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:01,998
She did it for...

590
01:11:05,085 --> 01:11:06,627
Dom, stop!

591
01:11:06,712 --> 01:11:08,838
Dom, stop it!
Please stop!

592
01:11:18,265 --> 01:11:21,893
She did it for you, Dom!
She did it for you!

593
01:11:26,398 --> 01:11:30,735
Letty came to me to clear your name
in exchange for bringing down Braga.

594
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,282
She just wanted you
to come home!

595
01:11:53,467 --> 01:11:55,259
I'm sorry, Dom!

596
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:56,761
I'm sorry!

597
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:27,458
You better have one hell of an
explanation. You disobeyed a direct order.

598
01:12:28,335 --> 01:12:30,336
Where's the shipment?
It's safe.

599
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:32,213
It's safe.

600
01:12:32,297 --> 01:12:35,174
Look, we could use the shipment
to parade in front of the media,

601
01:12:35,259 --> 01:12:37,176
get a few hundred pounds
of heroin off the street,

602
01:12:37,261 --> 01:12:40,972
but Braga's just gonna send another
shipment next week and the week after that.

603
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:43,182
Let's use the shipment
to lure Braga out

604
01:12:43,267 --> 01:12:45,309
and lop the head off
a multi-billion dollar cartel.

605
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:47,770
And how do you
suggest we do that?

606
01:12:47,854 --> 01:12:49,814
A hand-to-hand
exchange with Braga.

607
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:51,274
He'll never show.

608
01:12:51,358 --> 01:12:53,150
He can't afford not to.

609
01:13:03,287 --> 01:13:04,954
You got a plan?

610
01:13:06,456 --> 01:13:08,124
There's a price.

611
01:13:11,003 --> 01:13:13,796
We bag Braga,
you let Toretto walk.

612
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:24,807
Yes?
It's Dom.

613
01:13:25,851 --> 01:13:28,144
I was just
thinking about you.

614
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,440
You know, when I gave you my
number, I was hoping you'd call.

615
01:13:33,025 --> 01:13:35,568
But not under
these circumstances.

616
01:13:35,902 --> 01:13:39,030
What circumstances?
Me being alive?

617
01:13:40,073 --> 01:13:42,033
Don't take it personally.

618
01:13:42,534 --> 01:13:44,452
It's just business.

619
01:13:44,536 --> 01:13:46,120
I got some business
of my own.

620
01:13:47,414 --> 01:13:48,873
Get Campos.

621
01:13:51,376 --> 01:13:52,793
It's them.

622
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:58,132
Uh-huh.

623
01:13:58,383 --> 01:14:02,386
Was that how Braga inspires
loyalty? Killing his drivers?

624
01:14:02,888 --> 01:14:05,222
One can always
find more drivers.

625
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:07,475
It's just good business.

626
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:08,976
I want to trade.

627
01:14:09,269 --> 01:14:11,312
Braga doesn't negotiate.

628
01:14:11,396 --> 01:14:12,396
Fine.

629
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:17,360
You explain to him how all of a sudden
$60 million worth of product disappears.

630
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:20,363
I know that can't
be good for business.

631
01:14:21,448 --> 01:14:22,990
What do you want?

632
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:27,745
Six million cash,
delivered by Braga himself.

633
01:14:30,415 --> 01:14:32,041
I don't like being shot at.

634
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:35,670
I ain't gonna put my neck out again
unless he's got something to lose, too.

635
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:37,338
He'll never go for it.

636
01:14:37,422 --> 01:14:41,050
Either I deal with Braga,
or you do.

637
01:14:45,055 --> 01:14:46,597
When and where?

638
01:15:01,655 --> 01:15:05,574
Sir, players are onsite. Holding
positions at the perimeter.

639
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:08,619
All right. Listen up.
Everybody stay frosty.

640
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:11,372
We don't move a muscle untiI
O'Conner gives the signaI.

641
01:15:11,456 --> 01:15:14,166
When he gets the money,
you know what to do.

642
01:15:14,751 --> 01:15:17,211
Well, the good news is,
when we get this guy,

643
01:15:17,295 --> 01:15:19,714
you walk out of here
a free man.

644
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,507
Is that what
they told you?

645
01:15:21,591 --> 01:15:23,217
Yeah, that's the deal.

646
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:26,721
You still put milk and
cookies out for Santa Claus?

647
01:15:28,014 --> 01:15:29,181
Yeah.

648
01:15:33,979 --> 01:15:35,062
Here.

649
01:15:35,147 --> 01:15:37,231
In case things go shitty.

650
01:15:42,195 --> 01:15:44,238
Just like old times?

651
01:15:44,322 --> 01:15:45,614
Yeah.

652
01:15:49,202 --> 01:15:50,494
You dropped something.

653
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,747
That's what you wanted, right? Dom...

654
01:16:07,846 --> 01:16:10,473
He's harmless.
Don't worry about him.

655
01:16:12,225 --> 01:16:14,727
And he's really
sorry about Letty.

656
01:16:16,855 --> 01:16:18,647
Where's our stuff?

657
01:16:21,401 --> 01:16:24,695
You mean the stuff that
used to be in here, right?

658
01:16:25,864 --> 01:16:29,658
Well, you'll see it when we
see Braga. That was the deal.

659
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,036
No worries.

660
01:16:32,412 --> 01:16:34,413
Braga keeps his word.

661
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:19,917
$2 million.

662
01:17:21,002 --> 01:17:23,754
You get the rest
when I get my property.

663
01:17:28,093 --> 01:17:29,718
Stasiak.
We got a match.

664
01:17:29,803 --> 01:17:31,846
The fingerprint's
Braga's 100%.

665
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:34,390
Just waiting on faciaI
confirmation via fax.

666
01:17:34,474 --> 01:17:36,433
I got
a question for you.

667
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:40,271
You wearing pink when you were
clawing your way out of el barrio?

668
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:42,982
Order all agents
to move in.

669
01:17:43,066 --> 01:17:46,193
We got confirmation. Primary
suspect wearing gray suit.

670
01:17:46,278 --> 01:17:47,278
Let's move.

671
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:49,280
Sir, O'Conner hasn't
given us the signal yet.

672
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:52,700
What part of that didn't you understand?
We just got confirmation. Do it!

673
01:17:52,784 --> 01:17:56,120
FBl AGENT: Secure primary
suspect in gray suit. Repeat!

674
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:58,789
Secure primary suspect
in gray suit.

675
01:18:12,262 --> 01:18:14,972
You're thinking what
I'm thinking, right?

676
01:18:17,767 --> 01:18:19,393
He ain't Braga.

677
01:18:23,982 --> 01:18:24,982
Oh, shit.

678
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:27,401
Drop your weapons!
FBl!

679
01:18:27,819 --> 01:18:29,111
Get down!

680
01:18:32,616 --> 01:18:34,325
Get out of here!

681
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:40,289
Get out of here, Dom!

682
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,170
Run him down.

683
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:47,880
Go!

684
01:18:48,548 --> 01:18:50,215
Campos is Braga!

685
01:18:57,682 --> 01:18:58,974
Come on.

686
01:19:06,358 --> 01:19:08,484
Approaching primary target.

687
01:19:09,027 --> 01:19:11,195
Primary suspect is secure.

688
01:19:13,865 --> 01:19:15,658
He was under your nose
the whole time.

689
01:19:16,201 --> 01:19:17,952
Now Braga's escaped.

690
01:19:18,036 --> 01:19:20,996
Toretto's heading south, probably
long across the border by now.

691
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:23,290
Do you have any idea the kind
of trouble you're in, O'Conner?

692
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:25,334
I was doing my job.

693
01:19:25,418 --> 01:19:27,962
He ain't the first bad guy you
helped escape the law's grasp.

694
01:19:28,046 --> 01:19:30,005
As of now, you're being
taken off active duty,

695
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:33,050
until this house can
mount a formal inquiry.

696
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,971
What about Braga?

697
01:19:38,056 --> 01:19:40,391
That's no longer
your concern.

698
01:19:50,777 --> 01:19:52,277
We now know where Braga is, right?

699
01:19:52,362 --> 01:19:55,823
Customs tracked him via satellite
to his home base in Tecali, Mexico.

700
01:19:55,907 --> 01:19:58,325
Mexico is out
of our jurisdiction.

701
01:20:01,121 --> 01:20:02,705
The fact is

702
01:20:02,789 --> 01:20:06,875
the brass will be so busy holding
press conferences over the seizure,

703
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,086
we'll skate
under the radar.

704
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:12,589
I thought we signed on
to do the right thing.

705
01:20:50,962 --> 01:20:53,088
Everyone's looking for you.

706
01:20:53,465 --> 01:20:55,090
I'm right here.

707
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:57,718
It's nice to see you've
gone with the times

708
01:20:57,802 --> 01:21:01,388
and switched to electronic
fuel injection. Looks good.

709
01:21:02,515 --> 01:21:04,600
Buster became a gearhead.

710
01:21:08,688 --> 01:21:10,481
I'm going with you.

711
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:17,071
I don't plan on
bringing anyone back.

712
01:21:19,032 --> 01:21:20,365
I know.

713
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,793
Hit that throttle.

714
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:58,195
Hey.

715
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:42,990
How do you say goodbye
to your only brother?

716
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,577
You don't.

717
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,856
I thought you weren't
gonna show up.

718
01:23:57,941 --> 01:23:59,566
You saved my life.

719
01:24:00,443 --> 01:24:02,903
I'm willing to
return the favor.

720
01:24:06,783 --> 01:24:09,284
This will help
get you to Braga.

721
01:24:13,498 --> 01:24:14,581
Dom.

722
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:18,210
Going in there
is suicide.

723
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:28,512
I have no choice.

724
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,559
You must have
loved her very much.

725
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:55,330
So this is where
my jurisdiction ends.

726
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:03,297
And this is where
mine begins.

727
01:27:13,678 --> 01:27:15,554
You ain't forgiven.

728
01:27:19,016 --> 01:27:21,184
You boys want
to arrest me?

729
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:26,273
No, we're beyond that.

730
01:27:27,358 --> 01:27:30,152
You can't buy your way out of this one.

731
01:27:31,529 --> 01:27:33,196
You and me...

732
01:27:34,407 --> 01:27:37,242
You and me,
we're not so different.

733
01:27:38,995 --> 01:27:40,579
You're no hero.

734
01:27:51,215 --> 01:27:52,883
You're right.

735
01:27:56,012 --> 01:27:59,347
And that's why you're going
back across the border.

736
01:28:05,354 --> 01:28:07,063
But Fenix is mine.

737
01:28:08,065 --> 01:28:09,149
You got it.

738
01:28:31,422 --> 01:28:32,547
Shit!

739
01:28:37,595 --> 01:28:41,139
You'll make it a couple of
miles out, if you're lucky.

740
01:29:33,693 --> 01:29:35,944
You know where
you're going?

741
01:29:36,988 --> 01:29:39,155
You want to borrow my GPS?

742
01:29:42,868 --> 01:29:44,578
Where are your boys at?

743
01:29:44,662 --> 01:29:46,204
Are they going
to show up or what?

744
01:29:49,667 --> 01:29:51,710
Careful what you ask for.

745
01:30:08,019 --> 01:30:10,228
Just stop.
Just stop the car.

746
01:30:30,416 --> 01:30:32,125
Right behind you.

747
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:50,060
Dom, head to the tunnel.
Let's use the tunnel.

748
01:31:17,296 --> 01:31:19,255
Get out of here, Brian.

749
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:30,517
You sure you know where
the tunnels are? You sure?

750
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,811
Yeah. I'd hold on.

751
01:31:35,898 --> 01:31:37,565
This might hurt.

752
01:31:50,955 --> 01:31:53,123
You're in
my world now, baby!

753
01:32:21,736 --> 01:32:24,279
That's it, baby!
End of the road.

754
01:32:24,363 --> 01:32:25,822
Now what?

755
01:32:26,615 --> 01:32:27,699
Game over.

756
01:32:27,783 --> 01:32:29,325
No, no, no.

757
01:32:58,939 --> 01:33:00,356
Come on!

758
01:34:19,562 --> 01:34:20,645
Hey!

759
01:34:21,772 --> 01:34:23,606
Get me out of here!

760
01:35:53,739 --> 01:35:55,156
Pussy.

761
01:36:12,549 --> 01:36:14,175
Let me see that.

762
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,097
Yeah.
Just keep pressure there.

763
01:36:19,765 --> 01:36:21,766
You'll be all right.

764
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,732
You gotta get
out of here.

765
01:36:32,361 --> 01:36:34,362
I ain't running anymore.

766
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:42,078
I gotta ask you
something.

767
01:36:42,746 --> 01:36:43,871
Yeah?

768
01:36:44,623 --> 01:36:48,668
You know I would have won that
race if you didn't cheat, right?

769
01:36:51,755 --> 01:36:53,673
You hit your head hard.

770
01:36:58,554 --> 01:37:00,430
Don't make me laugh.

771
01:37:11,108 --> 01:37:12,483
All rise.

772
01:37:17,781 --> 01:37:19,490
Please be seated.

773
01:37:23,746 --> 01:37:25,788
Please rise,
Mr. Toretto.

774
01:37:28,167 --> 01:37:30,460
I've listened
to the testimony

775
01:37:30,961 --> 01:37:33,087
and taken into
special consideration

776
01:37:33,172 --> 01:37:37,175
Agent O'Conner's appeal of
clemency on behalf of Mr. Toretto.

777
01:37:38,135 --> 01:37:40,803
That his actions directly
resulted in the apprehension

778
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:43,723
of known drug
trafficker Arturo Braga.

779
01:37:45,267 --> 01:37:46,642
However,

780
01:37:47,936 --> 01:37:49,896
this judiciary
finds that

781
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:54,817
one right does not make up
for a lifetime worth of wrongs.

782
01:37:55,486 --> 01:37:57,236
And as such,

783
01:37:57,321 --> 01:38:02,325
I find that I am forced to level the
maximum sentence under California law.

784
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:06,412
Dominic Toretto,

785
01:38:07,247 --> 01:38:11,250
you are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life

786
01:38:11,335 --> 01:38:14,420
at the Lompoc maximum
security prison system

787
01:38:15,172 --> 01:38:17,965
without the possibility
of early parole.

788
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:20,384
This court is adjourned.

789
