So we have a dirty section

Bourne comes back for revenge,
tapes Abbott's confession

The reason Bourne went to Moscow was
to see the daughter of his first target.

What's your point, Pam?

39
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:21,609
Maybe he was
retracing his steps.

40
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,451
He's looking for something.
Something in his past.

41
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:27,686
Maybe he hasn't found it yet
and we need to know what it is.

Are you telling me he's not
a threat to this agency?

43
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:33,597
I think if he wanted to hurt us,
he could have sent the tape to CNN.

44

Maybe he still will.

the best, plan for the worst.

00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:19,665
Bourne? You're still looking for Bourne?
I thought that case was closed.

482

No, some people are convinced
he's still a threat.

483

I disagree, but to find out
I need to talk to him.

Hold on, Nicky.

485
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:30,611
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to send him a message.

486
00:41:30,687 --> 00:41:33,053
You don't think Bourne is a threat?
He just took out two more of my men.

487
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:34,714
The only way this has
a happy ending, Noah,

488
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,019
is if we bring him in alive.

489
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:38,026
He is going after Daniels.

490
00:41:38,094 --> 00:41:39,823
He wants revenge, Pam,
and the only realistic way

491
00:41:39,896 --> 00:41:41,921
to end this is to
eliminate the threat.
